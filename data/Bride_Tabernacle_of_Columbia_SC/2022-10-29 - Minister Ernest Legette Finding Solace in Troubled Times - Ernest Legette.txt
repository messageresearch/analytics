kindness towards us Lord for we love you we wouldn't trade it for nothing in the world oh God the grace that you've given us thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look at the Book of Genesis by God's grace Genesis 32. and very familiar scripture we won't be before you long the Lord's will amen thank the Lord for working miracles amen touching my mom and she's doing so well that they said they was going to move her today to a different hospital but she's doing tremendously well amen they said that they were looking for her to be talking for a long time but the very next day she was talking and my dad was telling me that morning yeah they said they talked to her I said Dad they communicated with her they didn't talk to her he said well they told me they talked to her so and sure enough she was talking so we thank God for that that was a miracle in itself amen God's still working miracles ain't he amen we'll share a little bit that tonight Genesis 32 by by the grace of God 32 and let's begin here at the at the 10th verse if you got to say Amen and it reads I am not worthy of the least of all the mercy and love and kindness and all the faithfulness which you have shown to your servant for forgive me I'm reading not an amplified version forgive me I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies and of all the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I have passed over this Jordan and now and become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him lest he come and smite me and the mother with the children you may be seated tonight I like that how Jacob said I'm not worthy of the least of thy mercies and all the truth which thou has showed unto me unto thy servant let's drop down to the 22nd verse and it reads and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two woman servants and eleven sons and passed over the forge a book and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that the angel prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob style was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaking and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel without for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed may God have the bless you to reading of his word again amen tonight by the grace of God you know we just like I said we just still stirred in our hearts and spirits and you know uh this is something that I ministered on the other week and I titled it finding finding solace in troubled times amen finding solace in troubled times so when we're talking about Solace we're talking about you know uh peace in the midst of of what should be sadness or troubles that you know things that should upset you but you find Solace so you find you find something that settles you you find something that you can have comfort in so tonight that's what we want to talk about is fine and solace in troubled times you know I said that in many many people in in when they're going through or when they're in trouble or when they're having uh things in their life heavy everybody has a go-to whether you know it or not that's what we call it I call it a go-to you got everybody got something that they leaned on to help pull them out of of the rut that they're in or pull them out so far as a way of their mind of getting them out of the where they where they're at and many times that go-to for an individual might be alcohol or it might be drugs or it might be you know a woman or a man or something and that's where they find their Solace at that they can find that that's what their go-to is but and we've seen that many times because we've we saw that you know even we've witnessed it that major tragedies happen and after those tragedies you know people become alcoholic so become like we say drug addicts or something so devastating happen to them that that they they they they they couldn't recover from it but the thing what that they used as a go-to they didn't realize that you know I says that yo you can try to find Solace and alcohol but when the alcohol is gone or when you can try to find Solace and drugs but when the high is gone you can find try to find solace in a woman or a man or any other thing else but when it's gone that problem gonna still be there that hurt or that pain or whatever is upset you it's gonna still be there because it that what you look for to Define solace and couldn't give you real peace it couldn't give you the rest or whatever you needed to deal with the situation amen so I say it's fine and Solace and troubled times you know like was saying the other night troubled times are coming you know the Bible says that many are the afflictions are the Righteous right but the Lord gonna deliver them from them all he said all that little Godly gonna suffer persecution right so the thing is it's not that you know God didn't promise us a cakewalk did he but he he promised he he said it's going to be a battlefield you know just paraphrasing it that we're going to be on so we know that in this battle in this battle or this war that we fight and it's going to be some casualties it's gonna be some hard times you know in the battle you talk to some of those soldiers it's going to be some times where you might have to go without water or you might have to go without food it's gonna be some times where you might get into some conflicts or shootouts where you don't know if you're gonna make it out alive or not but nevertheless when you're in the middle of that sometimes you can't reckon that's why they try to tell the boys get your minds clear have everything locked down at home they like to choose a lot of people that don't even have a family because they know that you know those times you got a family and things like that when you're in the middle of the battle you're going to be more concerned about that then you are the the fight that you're in and you'll most likely uh uh be killed too so we find that you know I said that's what we own we're on a battle we're in a battle a battle Saints you know it's easy when the Sun is up and and the sun is shining bright the praise God it's easy to shout and dance when it's sunny outside but when the rain began to fall you know I was on my knees it says when it when uh I was I was praying and I said Lord the rain has fallen and I said the waves are crashing you know and that seemed like I can hear something say to me and it's gonna get worse than this but even though I I seem like I can hear something say to me that I began to say but nevertheless the anchor holds I say to myself nevertheless the winds might get harder the waves might crash even harder but it ain't gonna knock me off for that anchor it might move you to the left or to the right but that anchor that which down inside of you not that I'm holding on to hit but something's got a hold of me and no matter how much the wind blow the waves crash I I ain't worried about that because I already know that he is a keeper that when I when it feels like sometimes you know you don't even have strength in your mind don't you know God to keep your mind gotta come down and he'll change the way you're looking at the situation change the way you're looking at the the whole thing because you know what it is it's the Holy Ghost I believe that you know all that we've been dealing with I said you know the greatest sermon that could ever be preached is you must be born again because of the reason being you know when things start coming you know and all that you ain't gonna be able to hold on you ain't gonna be able to hold out it's gonna have to be the spirit of God in you keeping you and that's why it says a lot of times we go on go on and play Church go on and go on and and put that on the back side great sermons and all that but it's going to take the spirit of God when things start shattering when things start shaking it's going to take the Holy Ghost to keep you come on how many believe that tonight I know it that's what it's going to take to keep you because you can't keep yourself so that's what it is get God while you got a chance come on don't wait till the Storm come and then you're gonna get knocked out but when the Holy Spirit is is falling while it's present now I say get God right now come on then when when the things start rolling you got something to keep you to hold you you got something on the inside of you that's giving you strength you don't know where that strength came from come on but I say is what it is tonight I didn't don't want to be long but I said fight finding solace in troubled times you got to have a go-to come on you got to have something that you find solace in that you know that that uh hey I always can go to this and I know this is going to bail me out I know that's gonna help me right here in my time of trouble I know this right here ain't gonna gonna let me go under no matter what you know I was looking at something and then Navy Seals was saying they find solace in the gunships away above them because they said that when they in trouble says that they and they they boxed in one time on every side and says that they was about to run out of bullets but they said that they find solace in those gunships they said they can call in air strikes and all that and it says that's one thing that the enemy don't know that because it's so far flying so high above them that it says that all they got to do is call it in and help is on the way come on and said they said those gunships saved so many lives but I began to think about that I said you know those guys felt good about that they had help far high above them watching down over them Hallelujah I began to say that you know we got something better than the gunships we got something better than that and I say is that he's not just high above him but he's near us Even in our mouth the word of faith come on but it's solace in that that when you boxed in on every side come on when you perplex when you cast down you know you ain't gonna be destroyed you know that what it is you know that God Is Watching Over You you know that God is there all he is is like like those boys say they they call him on the radio but all God is is a prayer away come on say hey we need some help down here we boxed in on every side the enemy is fighting us on every corner and God we about to run out of bullets we're about to run out of strength Lord we need your help come on we calling in Lord we need it we need it God we need your help and don't you know God God will never fail you come on I like that how God told Joshua once he said I won't fail thee it's something about God God won't fail you everybody else will failure everything else will failure but God won't y'all believe that tonight come on I said but you got to find Solace what is your go-to tonight you know I was thinking of of here you know reading about Jacob and how you know he was in trouble times wasn't he he was at a time you know a fearful fright of frightening time uh in his walk because you know he was going out and had to meet Esau but I like how he began to pray and say Lord you know I ain't worthy of the least of your mercies are all the truth that you've been showing showing me but you know he was in trouble times but in his troubled times he knew where to find Solace at didn't you he knew that God you promised me you the one told me to come back and go back amongst my people and you was going to bless me there you know you go on your reading he said Lord you said you was gonna my seed was gonna be here and so many God this is what yo this is what you promised you promised God that you'll protect me come on and here I am in troubled times Lord I need your protection but you know he found himself but I like how the Bible says that he got alone and when he got alone you know he wrestled there with him with with a man but in his wrestling you know it was something about him he wasn't going to quit until he found comfort he wasn't gonna quit stop until he knew I believe that something changed that something happened in them so that's why he began to say to him I ain't gonna let you go until you bless me come on I said the Lord in troubled times you get to that place you get to that point in your spirit the way you say God ain't gonna stop until you bless us Lord I ain't gonna stop until I hear a word from you we in trouble times and God this this is what your word said Lord you promised God we uh we need Solace you know going through all of these things that we've been dealing with and I says you know some of the guys at work you know they began to say Ernest to me that says what if God what if God don't do it you know with your mom and things don't turn out right they say are you your you and the family prepared to take that and you know I thought about it and I said you know we'll cross that hurdle when if if we get if we have to come to it but I begin to think about it at work there and you know I had a moment but I went out in my car and you know what I said to myself I sitting in the car I said Lord I need I said Lord I need a word from you I said God I need Solace right now so what I did I picked up the Bible and I just opened it up and I began to read and the place where I opened it up it began to to say in that place let's lay aside every week that's so easily beset you come on and then it goes on to say looking unto Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith and talking about the suffering that he went through but he was willing to endure those things and I said Lord that's where my Solace is he says lay aside every week I'll begin right there in the car I said Lord I'm laying aside every week and I said God I'm looking to you because you are the author in the finisher of my faith God I got faith in you but right there what happened Solace came right there you know I I received something that alcohol couldn't give you that drugs couldn't give you that no man couldn't give you but what it is I found solace in the word of God I found real peace in the word and I said Lord you know I began to say no matter what what you do no matter how the outcome is I said God I'll be pleased with it because you don't make no mistakes don't you know God don't make no mistakes that everything I was I was looking at something I says everything you know the Bible says all things work together for what for the good right unto them that love the Lord I said everything it in life you know God don't just do things but they got a purpose God knew situations was going to happen before they even happened God already knew it he already knew it these these these predestinated trials we're going through things to do what to perfect you God a lot of times shows you things in yourself that you didn't even know was there you know the prophet God was talking about in the desperation time he says you know you can claim what you got he says but when the real emergency comes he says that we'll see what we'll see what whatever's in in you when the real emergency comes that's what's going to come at you you want to see what a man made of let the real emergency come come on but that's how God tries us and and he brings out of you what's in you so I said that's why I believe David said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against you come on when the word is in your heart when the emergency comes then we're gonna see what's in you nothing gonna come at you but the word why because that's what's in you y'all believe that the word gonna come out you you have no other choice but to keep the word because the word is in you you got no other choice but to trust God because that's what's in you you don't have no other options no other way to go but I said that you know we we find that like it says fine and Solace we find that that that everything works together for the good these predestinated trials all these things you're going through right they doing they're doing something to perfect you you got to let God work on you because God is bringing something out of you even with all we've been dealing with God began to deal with me on some things and show me some areas in my life I was I was thanking God for my wife and she's she was pointing out some things and showing me some things about myself come on but I say is that God's God's got a way of doing things I was talking to my dad last night it was riding last night and I was like do you know Dad however God whatever God's got to do or however God do it come on I says that we're going to be satisfied with it I says but what we got to do is take what God's doing and build on it come on don't go back well we got to go forward whatever God whatever God is doing we got to go forward I says you know everything worked together for the good of them that love God everything's got a purpose I says no matter what it is I was looking at uh today at Joseph his life I says you know him being sold into slavery by his Brethren right that all of it had a purpose that was going to work together but now they couldn't see that purpose and it might have took years and it did I I even looked it up it took almost 17 years for that purpose to come in the full a manifestation for them to really him to really see what the purpose of that was right 17 years I think he was 17 when he went down to uh sold into slavery the Bible says Genesis I think it's uh I wrote it down but anyway Genesis 37 he was he was 17 years old when he sold out there right maybe thinking that's hard but remember God's got a purpose in everything right but he was only he he was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh now this 13 years later all the hardships that he might have gone through being lied on put in prison forgotten about all those things I could see him sometimes maybe looking at his life you know and maybe say Lord why me but we know that God blessed him no matter where he went couldn't see the purpose of it right from the beginning right but years later years later he can look back right and his brother in the nose uh after he revealed himself to him and they were afraid of him and thought he gonna kill him and all this but he began to tell his Brethren hey he says this wasn't y'all this was the Lord's doing he said y'all didn't y'all didn't sell me like that but God sent me down here because he already knew what was up ahead God preserved we couldn't see it from the beginning we couldn't see the purpose in the wide all this from the beginning and why all this happened from the beginning but God had a purpose in it now we see the purpose and what God is doing so that's why I said we don't kick up against God right we know that God's got a purpose and no matter what he's doing the trials what the things you faced with God's got a purpose in it and you might not see the purpose for years and if the Lord should tear it but nevertheless you got to understand that God is doing something come on God ain't done what you get Hallelujah I was telling telling my mom when I seen her the other day after they took the the vent off of her because they called they told me that morning you know that what they was wanting to do a uh or they were they were just saying you know the possibilities of what they might have to do right traits and all that stuff all things so you know but he was like just give us we'll just wait a couple more days and but then they called me and I talked with them that morning and they were saying well we ain't gonna do the day we ain't gonna take her off today he's gonna wake her up and and you know and all these things and then next thing you know they called me about three o'clock in the afternoon and they said well she doing so good we want to go and take it out today so I was like well yeah let's you go outside I'll be up there you know in about an hour you know taking me about two hours to get up there but when I got up there and you know and and she was doing so good and I walked in the room and they began to tell her they said look who come to see you and the first thing I said to her when I saw her I said you ain't done yet you know but what it is because I says that God still got a purpose come on and all that you've been through all that you you're going through I said God's got a purpose in it we might not see uh right now what God is doing but later on I believe one day we'll be able to look back come on and see a purpose and what you know I was I was telling my mom I said everybody on the job might be saved after all this because you know I everybody on the job praying everybody praying people that don't know how to pray everybody praying one of the guys told me once I told him I was going to prayer he asked me who I was praying to So I says I said uh Jesus and I know which way he was going I said do you don't believe Jesus uh I said you don't believe in Jesus I said now you better think about that before you answer and then he said well you know you could pray anything you pray the universe and all whatever you're saying you can pray to anything so then you know had everybody out there praying at the job everybody man we praying for your mama one of the guys at the job always big old guys telling my wife about them a lot of people scared of him so he did a lot of time big old big old guy and he'd always be like you know like he threatening people and all he come he said Earnest ain't called me over there one day he said what's your mama name so I told him he says uh imma call her name every morning when I get up and every night when I go lay down I'ma call her name and ask God to heal her I say hey but I said what well if you can't remember her name just say Ernest mama and I was getting uh when we went in the control room at work I said y'all God is about to move I said so and so I ain't gonna call his name I said he told me he gonna pray for my mom he gonna call her name every morning and every night come on I said God God do God gonna do something now but everybody was praying everybody the boss and everybody's saying Earnest every day actually say hey we're praying for your mama every time I seen him they say hey we praying we keep me we're praying for your mama come on and uh I remember uh I told Charlotte because she hadn't I was like y'all you know they having trouble waking her up and then they say no when she woke up one of the boys at work he said Ernest God got the final say so we just encouraging each other and you know they're praying and uh you know that's the same the same one guy he said whose report Do You Believe come on you know these are same guys now they'll talk about any and everything but now everybody talking about praying and Earnest man we hear from you in a while what's going on we praying for your mama man you know but God is so good whole atmosphere changed right he said Earnest you know one of the guys said man Ernest you need a hug man come on let me give you a hug oh man let you hug me they say man ain't nothing wrong with hugging each other you know he said hey come on let's show him come on y'all let's do a group hug like that so but I said God is doing so I told my mom I said everybody on the job gonna be saved but when she uh woke up and came through and I thought about that little song uh from Vanessa Bell Armstrong about uh the good news I'm here to tell you all about the good news that prayer still works so I was sending that out to everybody said prayer still works so you know when I went into the job I just threw my hand up like this everybody that saw me threw their head up like this they Earnest you back to normal now they said you back we backed they said yeah then everybody doing that and they said I I was saying no it's prayer still works and I'm talking about the whole plant blacks whites everybody prayer still works and the same God asked me who I was praying to I said who did you pray to he said he prayed he probably he prayed to the universe or something I said well prayer it still works God is the Healer anyway ain't he I began to tell him I said it don't matter you know no matter how you say it God is the Healer no come on ain't you but I says you know the thing is you you see what happens God everything's got a purpose in it come on everything got a purpose in it God God allow you to see the love people have for you but what it is you know the people they've been watching the way you've been acting too now they've been watching your response and how you've been acting when they was in their time of trouble right hey everybody you know just just uh coming together what I say is that what it is you know in in troubled times where do you find your Solace at come on that's why the word got to be so in you we don't preacher like we say nothing else but the word because that's the only thing gonna give you peace that's the only thing gonna keep you on that on up on your feet come on because the devil Got Away of dragging you down devil got a way of locking you up in your mind and all these things but the only thing Gonna Keep you is that Solid Rock you know Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word ain't gonna never pass away his word Got Away elevating you you know when everything around you every wind is blowing his words got a way of keeping sustaining you his word is God away hallelujah or keeping you full when everybody else sent me his word has got a way of giving you Joy come on when you should be down his word got a way of picking you up I like that it's something about the word he said I sent my word and it healed them you know the words got power in it I believe that the same way the word Jesus is the word come on so when we saw him what was he was he was the Living Word walking but that word is still living today that word is still lifting up that word is still healing you know the words got everything you need in it everything you need is in the word of God I was telling my Aunt Amy last night I said uh it's been a long long journey but Jesus was right there by my side come on I said you know what though I ain't just like I could never sing but I ain't just singing them songs no more it's life now been a long journey but Jesus was right there by my side he ain't never left my side he was right there the whole time by my side come on I like that little song I'ma hide behind that old mountain where the Chilly Winds Don't Blow Jesus is that mountain come on you got to find solace what is your solace what is your go-to tonight Hallelujah you know one thing I was looking at I was telling uh sister Keisha Lee I was saying that you know how I was in the room and one doctor come in and he says man everything is going good she's going in the right direction everything looks good like that he says man we need to start taking her off the sedation girl try to get this tube out everything is looking good everything's going good he began to say you know tell me man we're gonna try to get her off she needs to come off for this right and I say oh that sounds like a good plan to me this was about a week or two ago so uh he is talking good and everything looks good everything looks good 10 minutes after that I was telling sister Keisha the infections or disease in this doctor or whatever he comes in he's over there doing this thing and I said you know who what you got what you got going on so who you know I don't know what you what you checking oh I'm the infectious diseases person he ordered something for us I was like what's you know what what you got going on and it's 10 minutes after the doctor said everything going good he looks at me and says your mama's sick she's really really really sick I says well could you explain what really you saying really really really sick could you be more specific he said some stuff I couldn't even understand but he said she's really really oh she's a sick woman so I said you know what let me let you talk to my sister that's what I told him so I started calling sister Keisha Lee he said he said oh I got to go see some other patients I ain't got time to talk right now I said well I want you to explain to her what you just told me he said oh no he said you just tell her she's a sick woman like that and walks out I said to myself whose report do you believe who but you see what I said you know don't the enemy do that now come on say oh he was just telling the truth come on but the enemy does that come on comes in the doctors and stuff just tell the truth too don't they all of them but what does the word of God say they're with his stripes right so who's reporting are you gonna believe tonight come on I say it's about what it is oh Hallelujah you got to find solace come on in troubled times not just I I always say you know you could you could talk talk come on but when but when the pressure comes what you gonna do when the pressure come come on you ain't gonna just all of a sudden learn how to pray all of a sudden learn how to give it over to God but God is training you God is bringing you through these little tests these little trials to build you up for things build you up those little wins are building you up for the stronger winds but all you're doing it ain't that you're learning tactics but all you're doing and is learning how to lean and depend on Jesus all you're doing is learning how to give it over to God because you brought me through this Lord I know I couldn't handle that you handled it now God I'm looking for you to handle this all you're doing is learning how to let how to let go even more and let God have his way because God wants to handle it you know I was on my knees in prayer things was coming all around I said Lord you know I need wisdom but you know I thought about Joshua I said when they went in God promised them the whole land is yours I give it to you come on he said the place every place to shoulder your foot touch try to tread upon he said I'm gonna give it to you ain't gonna be a man to be able to stand before you come on long as you keep the word now he says that as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee that's what we're beginning to tell them God ain't gone come on God didn't leave God is still here and just as he was with Moses or with the prophet so he's with us but I began to say you know looking at Joshua if he would have looked at maybe had the maps out oh we got the malachites here the amorites here look at the whole battle and begin counting up how many people he got the more he looked at the whole thing the whole picture then it would have looked pretty Grim right maybe it would have caused him to look at a certain way but I don't believe he looked at it like that but I believe he looked at it one mountain at a Time come on one city at the time one fight at the time one battle at the time come on we we know that God has given us the land right and we're taking it one he said to place every place to show your foot touch I'm gonna give it to you we taking it one foot step at a time so I began to look at all the situation trials I said we're going to take it one bit one mountain at a time we're gonna look at it one victory at a time and every victory that God give it give us we ain't giving up no ground now come on bro we're gonna take it and we're gonna move on to the next objective because God has given us the land already we ain't gonna let it be Cloud we ain't gonna we ain't gonna be swamped because as my sister Rachel was telling me she says uh Jermaine there's too many Devils to fight at one time we can't fight them all at once I said no we can't I said we're gonna get them one at the time so after she had the baby the Lord blessed her to have the baby the other day I said okay we got one we got one Victory we're moving on to the next one so we begin to say hey we go we're gonna look at that I said now Rachel you don't got the baby out the way now you can help me fight now I said now she said okay I said you can help me I said cause I got almost got bogged down I said but you can help me now she said okay I said I know you can't do much in strength I said but you don't got the baby out of the way you can help me fight now but what it is taking the Lord was showing me in prayer we we taking it one victory at a time one mountain at the time nevertheless God has given us the victory but we ain't worried about how many of them out there because we know what the promise of God says and what we're going to do is take it foot step by footstep city by City Mountain by Mountain Victory by victory until the battle is over with Hallelujah say Ernest or how are you gonna wonder how did you get through come on by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony I took it one step at a time I took it one victory at a time one mountain at a time until God gave us the whole land Hallelujah and I thank God for that tonight even our Christian Journey what are we doing one mountain at the time one victory at the time one trial at the time come on things coming but we know that God is always already given it to us we're just gonna fight come on Hallelujah I thank God for that tonight you know I says that God is so good to us you know the only you know he shows us that he's the same yesterday today and forever all the time you know I begin I was praying all day today and I couldn't couldn't help from saying Lord thank you Lord as the Lord thank you for touching my mama Lord thank you for allowing her to still be around I said Lord thank you you know and the thing is though we got to thank God you got to thank God for everything don't you know things can turn so easy but you got to learn how to thank God I had him sing that song Sunday uh praise is what I do when I want to be close to you I like that little part where it says I'll praise you through the good and the bad come on a lot of people just sing that song but waiting to the bad come are you still gonna praise God oh you're gonna go on a in a slump somewhere come on but that's what it is I was telling somebody the other day I said you know what it is the devil he he didn't stole your praise and what he gonna do now you want to work on everybody else I said but you shouldn't let the devil do that no matter what well how you feel I said no matter how you feel lift your hands how bad you feel lift your hands and say God thank you any huh come on say Lord I praise you oh through the hurt and the pain I told him I said just lift your hands and say Lord thank you just say thank you Jesus I say you I think what am I thinking of for oh thank you Jesus thank you for life thank you for help thank you for stress I don't feel like it but thank you anyhow Lord I had to press my way but Lord thank you I said you got to lift your hands and say thank you come on oh Jesus but I said the devil don't stole your praise I said I told him I said but you know what he ain't gonna steal mine because I've appraised them through the good and the bad whether I'm happy or whether I'm sad come on whether I got money in the bank or not I can't still can't lose my praise come on these things shouldn't Define you Jesus said that you know he he says that that the carnal things and all that just paraphrasing it he said that ain't what that that shouldn't be what makes a man come on what makes you that shouldn't be what what you governed by come on but in all things you should be content come on that God saved you that he brought you out a world of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light that he showed you that you belong to him and that he wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and once you know that that God has predestinated you it ain't no trial it ain't no situation it ain't no test it ain't nothing that's going to be able to stop you or to move you from the love of God come on no powers or nothing can't shake you because God knew you and he already predestinated you to make it through it y'all believe that I said but God is so good come on I didn't want to be long but I said fine and solace in troubled times come on what is your go-to tonight what is your go-to come on I know one thing my go-to is the word the word I'll lift you up it'll lift you up by the Dark Places the world will lift you up amen [Applause] thank God for the word tonight amen I was just listening to my brother Ernest and you know I was thanking the lord for he the prayer changed things amen when you get desperate now I wrote down desperation and thinking about what the prophet said we got the prayers of beer and we got to be desperate amen I remember first looking into what the prophet was saying and message of the hour and he says the desperation was something I really you know really enjoyed that message and uh perseverance and it's just messages like that did really you know make you stronger and just really you know just listening and getting courage and getting strength I want to say one thing you know to sitting there listening to the word and you know sometimes we see our loved ones and they look like they're backing up and they're getting further away from God and look like they're backsliding all and you get at them about it and God just saying believe just saying to me don't don't tell them don't get at them don't fuss at them just said I'm just gonna love you back and I'm just going to pray you bye show them do you love them more because you know fussing that I'm a might make him go farther back but show them how much you love them showing how much you care about them you know when you if you can set it in church and your loved ones are not here and they could be here then how much do you love them when you love them enough to get out on your knees and make a depressed services to be crying out for them how much do you love them he said well I I love love is action and we can get out on our needs and we cry out for them if we don't you know make it depressed service get on our knees and start crying out for them that God would touch them and deliver them just as much as we you know went in fasting and praying for sister Marie and sister Grace and the different needs you you got to love enough to stand in the gap you know you know what's important to you you'll find out what's important to you that's what you'll go that extra mile of the way for and sometimes the most important thing is that your loved ones sold the way that soul don't spend eternity sometimes those things are not as important we don't go that extra mile that extra effort to make sure they're in the house of the Lord to make sure that you know they were in right standing with God that you're praying for them and you know that you want them to be there and they know that you love them enough that you want them to be there but it's going to take your prayer not to you know fussing and arguing with them it's going to take your prayer and letting them know I love you I want you to be here I want you to be in the house of the Lord I don't want you to miss church I want you to be here and I you know but you got to talk to him and tell them I want you to be here amen because I want you to make it to heaven now this is the place where you ought to find your joy this is where you find your peace in the house of the Lord this is the place you'll come here and you find Satan a safe Zone when two or three are gathered in my name God said I'll be in the best and you you got to know that you you got to know that for you and you you got to get that in your heart and Lord you meet me here amen and not only you meet me here when I go home I gotta have that same type of fellowship with the Lord I got to know that God is with me they in and day out and if you got a friend and they can't come to the house of the Lord I believe sometimes you got to give that friend up are you with me see because we can be so close to the world and and not knowing that it's having an effect on our spiritual world anything that would keep you from the house of the Lord family friends or whatever you got to check it out you got to be you need to be in the house of the Lord you need to put God first these These are the little simple things it ain't much that God asks us to do and the little that he accesses do if we do that you're going to see major things happen for you and blessings and things going to happen on your behalf the little little things amen it's a great thing with God because that's that's all we can do come to the house of Lord worship and praise him and thank him that's it hear the word I mean that's you're not asking us to do a whole lot you know but that's all of the people work hard on their job and they can't wait to the weekend or they can go to nightclub you know what I'm saying they work hard you get a drink go to the nightclub and party I mean some of them that's all they work for it you know I'm saying but you got a chance to come to the house of the Lord it's got to be that same type of attitude I'm working hard on my job I want to come to the house of Lord I'm going to join the Lord amen and when we get to the point we enjoying the Lord like that we need to be back in the nightclub Oh Yes Man are y'all with me and then nobody can take that away from me that Zeal and that determination away from you nobody can do that praise God when you come and you cry out to God that's power in prayer I said that on Sunday there's power in prayer and you keep on praying and see the power of God begin to manifest it not for somebody else in your life the more you pray and cry the God wants and see the power see the family member see what God how God move the power of Prayer God bless you thank God for the word let us stand God is good amen won't be long we'll be leaving here the volcanoes erupting there and it's a highway or somewhere oh y'all didn't see that oh everything is earthquake in San Francisco five point something if we get up to seven point something it might take a whole San Francisco hour what what what what what's going to happen then Lord did I do all that I could do did I do I have that all that

what's going to happen if California happen to have a seven point something all of a sudden it drops in the ocean and then I'm gonna cry I need all I need all God [Music] we can get real then you get scary don't you but I believe that's exactly how it's going to happen a lot of unconcerned people are going to be concerned then you know what I'm saying they're gonna really get on fire for God then but it'll be too late because they know what the prophet said are you with me so by the grace of God it's time for us to get on fire now just keep on going like everything is normal nothing going to happen that's what happens in the days of law is like nothing's gonna happen all of a sudden it happened just like he said are you with me it'll be the same way people are not concerned about their soul God bless you I hope that we all get concerned about our soul and where we're going to spend eternity because soon and soon and very soon we got to go see the king God bless you let us by our
