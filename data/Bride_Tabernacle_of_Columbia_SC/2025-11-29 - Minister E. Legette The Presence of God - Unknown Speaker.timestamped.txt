[31:33] But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarses
[31:36] from the pre from the presence of the
[31:38] Lord, and went to Japa, and he found a
[31:41] ship going to Tarses. So he paid the
[31:43] fair thereof and went down into it to go
[31:47] with them to Tarses from the presence of
[31:49] the Lord. You may be seated. I'm going
[31:51] to read down a little further.
[31:53] But the Lord sent out a great wind into
[31:55] the mighty a great wind into the sea.
[31:59] And there was a mighty tempest in the
[32:01] sea, so that the ship was like to be
[32:04] broken. Then the mariners were afraid
[32:07] and cried every man unto his god and
[32:09] cast forth the wares that were in the
[32:11] ship into the sea to lighten it of them.
[32:15] But Jonah was gone down into the sides
[32:17] of the ship and he lay and was fast
[32:19] asleep. So the shipmaster came to him
[32:22] and said unto him, "What meanest thou,
[32:25] oh sleeper? Arise and call upon thy God,
[32:29] if so be that God will think upon us
[32:32] that we perish not." And they said
[32:34] everyone to his fellow, "Come and let us
[32:36] cast lots, and we may know that we may
[32:40] know for whose cause this evil has come
[32:42] upon us." So they cast lots. And the lot
[32:45] fell upon Jonah. Then said they unto
[32:49] him, "Tell us, we pray thee, for whose
[32:52] cause this evil is upon is upon us? What
[32:55] is thine occupation in whence camest
[32:57] thou? And what is thy country? And of
[33:01] what people art thou?" And he said unto
[33:04] them, I am in Hebrew, and I fear the
[33:07] Lord, the God of heaven, which have made
[33:09] the sea and the dry land. Then were the
[33:13] men exceedingly afraid, and said unto
[33:14] him, Why hast thou done this? For the
[33:17] men knew that he fled from the presence
[33:20] of the Lord because he had told them.
[33:24] May God had a blessed reading of his
[33:25] word. Tonight, by the grace of God, I
[33:28] want to talk about the presence of of
[33:29] God. Amen.
[33:31] talk about the presence of God. Now we
[33:33] know that we what we see here Jonah was
[33:36] a man you know called by God and you
[33:39] know sent by God to do a uh prophesied
[33:43] to ungodly nation at that time. Amen. To
[33:46] a gentile nation. But one thing about it
[33:50] I like I was reading here how you know
[33:52] uh it kept saying in the scriptures that
[33:55] he was fleeing the presence of the Lord.
[33:57] He was fleeing. He was trying to get
[33:58] away from the presence, right? And even
[34:00] though even the men here and one thing
[34:02] about it, I was thinking, you know, uh,
[34:04] Harris, Jonah running from the presence
[34:06] of God. And
[34:08] but when the when the ship, you know,
[34:11] when this when the winds got to blowing
[34:13] and the storm got real bad, there
[34:15] something about everybody was in fear
[34:16] and doing their best to keep the ship
[34:18] from sinking. But in all of that noise
[34:22] and all that that had was going on,
[34:23] Jonah was still in the in the ship, but
[34:26] he was sleeping at the time. And
[34:28] sometimes you think like, why why was he
[34:30] sleeping? Didn't all that commotion,
[34:32] everything wake him up? But I believe
[34:34] that one thing about it, Jonah knew why
[34:36] all the commotion was going on, right?
[34:38] Because he was trying to get away from
[34:41] the presence of God. Amen. And we find
[34:43] that today is we want to talk about the
[34:45] presence of God. We find that today that
[34:47] many people try to flee the presence.
[34:50] God's calls on many people lives and you
[34:53] know he's got maybe a work for you to do
[34:55] or he's just calling on you because he
[34:57] wants to do something in your life and
[34:59] but many of times instead of running to
[35:01] God mo many people run away from his
[35:04] presence. How many believe that just as
[35:06] you and I as God called us one day maybe
[35:09] you didn't want to come from the very
[35:10] beginning but God one thing about him he
[35:13] wasn't going to never leave you alone.
[35:14] Amen. He let you run and and go here, go
[35:17] there, you know, but and one thing about
[35:20] God, if he has a calling or something on
[35:22] your life, he going to keep stirring it
[35:23] up, stirring up the wind, stirring up
[35:26] the things, you know, in your life until
[35:29] you come to the reckoning that God, I I
[35:31] know you're calling on me and I'm I'm
[35:33] going to quit running from you.
[35:34] Hallelujah. But it's always been in in
[35:37] man's, you know, a desire many times to
[35:40] run from that presence, right? And you
[35:42] know we find here that God when he was
[35:44] calling on Jonah you know it looked like
[35:46] he would have you know people say if God
[35:48] call me Lord send me I'll go right but
[35:51] many of times you know uh uh you say
[35:54] that within yourselves but God may send
[35:57] you somewhere that is totally against
[35:59] where you want to go right cuz God like
[36:02] we said he could have many of times he
[36:04] could have he could have sent Jonah to
[36:05] his own people to a godly nation to
[36:08] pronounce blessings and all these things
[36:10] but no he's sent them to an ungodly
[36:12] nation, right? To a people that was
[36:14] considered at the time to be gentile
[36:16] dogs. And not only that, he wanted him
[36:18] to cry out against it, right? Come on.
[36:21] And that didn't seem to be appealing at
[36:23] the time. So Jonah, he didn't want to
[36:25] go. But one thing about God, you know,
[36:27] we can't choose, you know, our own uh
[36:29] battles and such things like that. Only
[36:32] thing we can do is learn how to obey
[36:34] God's voice. Because no matter what God
[36:37] wants to do in your life, one thing
[36:39] about it, if the presence, if God is
[36:41] there with you, can't nothing harm you.
[36:43] Hallelujah.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what I look at. You
[36:46] know, it's something about the presence
[36:48] of God. The presence of God, many people
[36:50] think they don't need that presence. And
[36:52] it's a difference between the presence
[36:54] of God and just excitement.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. Sometimes people are just
[36:59] excited and they thinking that's the
[37:00] presence, but that's not the presence.
[37:02] The presence of God brings, I believe, a
[37:04] peace about it.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; The presence of God will bring a peace
[37:09] in the midst of all of what's going on.
[37:11] It's a peace there because the presence
[37:13] of God is there.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; And when you walk knowing that you got
[37:18] something. Hallelujah.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. That you packing something.
[37:21] Everybody like in the in those days when
[37:24] they were in the uh Saul and and Goliath
[37:26] showed out showed up and everybody
[37:28] running and trembling. He had all of
[37:31] Israel trembling. But it was something
[37:32] about David. He is walking with a
[37:34] presence. Come on. I believe he says in
[37:37] the one of the Psalms, "In the presence
[37:38] of mine enemies, thou anointest my head
[37:40] with oil."
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yay. Though I walk through the
[37:43] valley and the shadow of death, I won't
[37:45] fear no evil. Why? Because thou art with
[37:48] me.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. We talking about the presence.
[37:50] When he is there. Come on.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's We talking about the
[37:54] presence. We talking about when God is
[37:55] there.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Not just excitement. Oh, we got we got
[37:59] warriors. Come on. That don't mean
[38:00] nothing, does it? But when the presence
[38:03] is there, right? Come on. It is no giant
[38:06] that'll stand before you. Hallelujah.
[38:08] Because you know that one thing about
[38:10] it, the presence of God makes a
[38:12] difference.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; I like how I was reading here in in uh
[38:15] in in Exodus 33 and how God was telling
[38:18] Moses knows he was saying, "I brought
[38:20] you out of Egypt. I want you to go on up
[38:22] to the land." Right? And he says of the
[38:24] Amorites, Malachites and all those
[38:25] things. And then but Moses began to tell
[38:27] God, he says, "Lord, I'll go." He says,
[38:29] "But if your presence ain't with us,
[38:31] then let me know because I won't go." He
[38:34] said, "Because I I can't go if your
[38:36] presence ain't with us." Right? But one
[38:39] thing about it, even though they were
[38:40] small in number, wasn't even skilled in
[38:42] battle, Moses had an understanding that
[38:45] if God sent us and his presence is
[38:47] there, we don't have nothing to fear.
[38:49] Hallelujah.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. Why? Because he can look back
[38:52] and see how God sent them as a one-man
[38:54] evasion, right? To go down to Egypt. And
[38:57] what made the difference? Moses in that
[38:59] staff, the presence of God, didn't it?
[39:01] &gt;&gt; So, he began to in his in his life begin
[39:04] to realize that God, I'll go, but Lord,
[39:07] let me know if your presence ain't
[39:08] there. Because God, I can't do nothing
[39:10] without your presence.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; But if you'll let me know that your
[39:13] presence is going to be there and God
[39:14] begin to tell Moses, he says, "My
[39:16] presence will be with you. You got favor
[39:18] with me." Hallelujah. SO, GO ON UP. AND
[39:20] THAT'S A BLESSING, RIGHT? To know that,
[39:22] you know, and sometimes the people
[39:24] around you can't understand the faith
[39:26] that you got. Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Sometime a husband or wife
[39:30] can't understand the faith that you got.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Friends can't understand. But your faith
[39:34] ain't in what what these five senses or
[39:37] the things around you. But your faith is
[39:39] in an almighty God. Hallelujah.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Your faith is in the creator of all
[39:45] creators. So everybody saying, "Man, you
[39:47] must be crazy, right? God ain't show up
[39:50] yet, but you say, no, he might have
[39:52] didn't, but he'll never leave me nor
[39:53] forsake me." Now, come on. He'll be
[39:56] there right on time. Right.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. And even when it looks like
[40:00] there is no hope, when he shows up,
[40:02] there's hope. Hallelujah.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; He is a life, right?
[40:06] &gt;&gt; God brings life to dead situations.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; He does, don't he?
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. But one thing about it, that's
[40:13] why I love the presence of God. Come on.
[40:16] All the excitement will be all right.
[40:17] But when I tell you what, when the giant
[40:19] show up, when the real devil in a battle
[40:21] comes, that excitement is gone. Then
[40:23] what you going to do? Hallelujah. But
[40:25] when it's the presence, it brings a
[40:26] peace about it, don't it? Come on.
[40:28] Hallelujah. When the when the peace has
[40:31] come, you you learn how to say, "Hey,
[40:33] settle down. Everything going to be all
[40:35] right in the morning." Hallelujah. Come
[40:37] on. I won't be afraid of the the the the
[40:40] terror arrows by day or the terror by
[40:41] night. I won't be afraid of those
[40:43] things. Why? Because I know that God's
[40:45] presence is here. Hallelujah. Many don't
[40:47] WANT TO WALK DOWN CERTAIN roads because
[40:49] they see the like we often say, the
[40:52] valleys and the shadows of death. But if
[40:53] you know that God is with you,
[40:55] hallelujah, not only he's with you, but
[40:57] he's in you and he's speaking and
[40:59] leading and directing your path.
[41:01] Hallelujah. And his word is like a lamp
[41:03] to YOUR FEET. HALLELUJAH. LIGHTEN UP
[41:06] EVERYWHERE YOU GO. HALLELUJAH.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. But we find that many
[41:12] people, they want to get away from that
[41:14] presence. But I want to tell you
[41:15] tonight, you need that presence.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Like we says, many times you go
[41:21] in uh you go in uh or you might see
[41:23] certain places and uh churches or
[41:26] whatever they jump shout and everybody
[41:28] going come on. But it's a difference
[41:30] now, right? When the real battle,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; the real fight comes, right?
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Where is that preacher that said
[41:36] everybody jump up and shout, everybody
[41:38] do this, everybody do that. Where is he
[41:39] at now?
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a difference then, right?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when his presence shows up.
[41:48] Hallelujah.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, it'll make devils tremble, won't it?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; It'll make situations change when the
[41:54] presence of God show up. And that's what
[41:56] I want more than JUST SAY JUMP SHOT.
[41:58] HAL, COME ON. BUT I WANT THAT PRESENCE.
[42:00] HALLELUJAH.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many want that tonight?
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. But many of people, they flee
[42:06] from they they try to run from that
[42:08] presence. But that presence make the
[42:09] difference. You know, I was I was
[42:11] sharing with with uh Charlotte the other
[42:13] day. that was saying, you know, it's
[42:15] something about, you know, you can see
[42:17] God calling on people or you see God
[42:20] dealing with individuals, right? But
[42:23] they try their hardest to run, run, run
[42:25] from that presence.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; I said, "When will they understand that
[42:29] it's God that's calling on them?"
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; I asked the question. I said, "How good
[42:34] does God have to be to people for them
[42:36] to serve them?"
[42:37] &gt;&gt; COME ON, JESUS.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; HOW GOOD DOES GOD BE TO YOU? HALLELUJAH.
[42:43] to serve him. Hallelujah. TO JUST STOP
[42:46] TRYING TO GET YOUR LIFE together and
[42:49] say, "Lord, what will thou have me to
[42:51] do?" HALLELUJAH.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; HOW [screaming] GOOD DOES GOD have to be
[42:54] to you?
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; How many times does God have to heal
[42:58] your body? Hallelujah. HOW MANY DARK
[43:00] NIGHTS DOES GOD HAVE TO SHOW UP WITH
[43:02] YOU, RIGHT, FOR YOU TO WANT TO serve God
[43:05] and live for him? Hallelujah. Come on.
[43:07] IT TAKES SOME MORE THAN OTHERS, DON'T
[43:09] IT? BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, if you
[43:11] BELONG TO GOD, HE'LL never stop chasing
[43:13] after you.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because you belong to him.
[43:16] Hallelujah. AND ONE BLESSED ASSURANCE,
[43:18] WE KNOW THAT HE'LL never lost one,
[43:20] RIGHT?
[43:21] &gt;&gt; COME ON. ALL THE FATHER'S GIVEN HIM WILL
[43:23] WHAT? [screaming] COME. HALLELUJAH. ONE
[43:26] WAY OR ANOTHER.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; I feel good about that.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God never stopped chasing
[43:32] after me. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm glad that
[43:35] God kept calling on me till one day I
[43:37] was willing with enough courage to stop
[43:40] and say, "Lord, here I am." HALLELUJAH.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; OH, I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING and running
[43:44] and kicking against your will.
[43:46] Hallelujah.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. And that's where Jonah came
[43:49] at, right? Come on.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; He ran from that presence, didn't he?
[43:53] Though he tried to get in the ship, PAY
[43:55] HIS WAY TO GO THERE. The pres God knew.
[43:57] I believe God is sitting there laughing.
[43:58] Come on, wind. Come on.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, WAVES. RIGHT. SHAKE OUT THE
[44:02] STORM. THE THE the uh the seas a little
[44:04] bit. Right?
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. One thing about IT THOUGH, ALL
[44:08] THAT WAS GOING ON, JONAH KNEW.
[44:10] HALLELUJAH. RIGHT. And the people when
[44:12] he began to tell them that I'm running
[44:14] from the presence. That's why all these
[44:15] things are happening. Come on. So they
[44:17] took him and WE KNOW THE STORY. THREW
[44:19] him overboard. RIGHT. GOD HAD A FISH.
[44:22] God prepared a fish, right?
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. Took him down. You know, till
[44:27] we I was looking at it. I SAID SOMETIMES
[44:29] GOD got to take you to the lowest to the
[44:31] low, right?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY ROCK BOTTOM, AS WE OFTEN SAY,

[44:37] when you get there.

[44:40] [screaming] THE LOWEST OF LOW, RIGHT?
[44:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; TO GET THEM TO STOP.
[44:46] HALLELUJAH.
[44:47] And to GET AN AUDIENCE WITH God right

[44:53] towards the your your your holy temple.
[44:55] Come on. I'm going look TOWARDS HE
[44:57] CALLED EVERYTHING AROUND HIM LYING
[44:59] VENDES. BUT HOW DID HE GET THERE? HE PUT
[45:01] HIMSELF THERE, RIGHT?
[45:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE HE
[45:05] DIDN'T WANT THE PRESENCE OF GOD. HE
[45:06] WANTED TO RUN FROM IT.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. BUT EVEN THERE, THE PRESENCE
[45:10] [screaming] OF GOD STILL FOUND HIM
[45:11] THERE, DIDN'T IT? HALLELUJAH. OH JESUS.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad. That's one thing. Come on.
[45:17] I said HE NEVER LOST ONE NOW.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. HE'LL GO TO THE DEPTHS TO GET
[45:22] THAT ONE, won't he?
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. But the presence,
[45:27] come on. I says one thing about it. Come
[45:29] on. How, as we were saying, how good
[45:31] does God have to be? I want to say
[45:33] tonight, you know, you know how good God
[45:35] has been to us. He could have cut many
[45:38] off long time ago.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's the truth. People don't,
[45:43] OH, YOU SHOULD. He could have cut He
[45:45] could have cut me off long time ago.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. But one thing about God, he's
[45:49] longsuffering.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. And you might TRY TO FLEE FROM
[45:53] THAT PRESENCE. MIGHT THINK YOU DON'T
[45:55] NEED IT, BUT ONE DAY YOU'LL COME BACK
[45:56] RIGHT BACK AROUND TO IT.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHETHER IT'S IN JUDGMENT OR
[46:01] WHETHER IT'S IN MERCY, YOU'LL COME BACK
[46:03] AROUND TO IT. Sometimes people try to
[46:06] stop their ears up because they don't
[46:08] want to hear the voice. Hallelujah. BUT
[46:10] ONE THING ABOUT THAT VOICE, YOU CAN STOP
[46:12] YOUR EARS UP, BUT YOU CAN'T STOP THAT
[46:13] [screaming] VOICE.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; THAT VOICE WILL KEEP CRYING.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[46:19] OH, JESUS. Come on. There's something
[46:21] about THAT VOICE. AND NOT ONLY NOT ONLY
[46:23] YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE VOICE OF
[46:25] GOD. I mean man, come on. But that's one
[46:28] thing. But one thing about THE VOICE OF
[46:30] GOD, IT HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE
[46:32] MOUNTAINS.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. IT IT GOT THE ABILITY TO SHAKE

[46:40] [screaming] OUT ALL THE NOISE THAT'S
[46:41] AROUND YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; AND SPEAK TO YOUR SOUL ONE DAY.
[46:44] HALLELUJAH.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. You know, one thing about I'm
[46:48] stirred. I says one thing. We're talking
[46:51] about that shaking. I says, you know, I
[46:54] dreamed and I dreamed again the other
[46:56] night. You know, I dreamed that I says I
[46:59] was at work and it and as we started
[47:03] feeling we thought it was an earthquake
[47:05] at work here, but it was it was the
[47:08] aftershocks of earthquake that had just
[47:10] hit California
[47:12] and we felt it all the way over here in
[47:14] west in in in Lexon. So I called
[47:17] Charlotte. I says, you know, hey, she
[47:20] was saying, yeah, a big earthquake just
[47:21] hit California and we feeling the
[47:23] aftershocks of it. I said, man, if it's
[47:25] that big, I asked her, I said, is the
[47:27] house still standing? For some reason in
[47:29] my mind, that's what I was thinking
[47:30] about.
[47:31] But I told her, I said I says, I'm
[47:34] afraid to look at the news cuz if it
[47:35] was, if we could feel it all the way
[47:37] over here, it ain't there no more.
[47:39] That's how big that earthquake was. But
[47:42] then I dreamed again like two nights ago
[47:44] maybe. But another big one hit and it
[47:48] was bad bad out in California. But what
[47:51] it is I says what what is God? Come on.
[47:54] Sometimes oh just a dream but I want to
[47:56] tell you dream is going to come true one
[47:58] day. Come on. But I want to say one
[48:00] thing about it. It could shake but it
[48:03] can't shake you out that presence.
[48:04] Hallelujah.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; If God's got your life. Hallelujah.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; He's got in control. Come on. One thing
[48:10] about HE CAN'T TAKE YOUR SOUL NOW.
[48:12] HALLELUJAH. SHAKE ALL IT WANT. BUT ONE
[48:15] THING I KNOW, IT CAN'T SHAKE ME OUT OF
[48:17] THAT PRESENCE. HALLELUJAH. DON'T YOU
[48:19] KNOW YOU'RE IN GOD'S HAND? And when
[48:21] you're in GOD'S HAND, CAN'T NOBODY TAKE
[48:23] YOU OUT. HALLELUJAH.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; He said you engraved in A PALM OF MY NO.
[48:27] COME ON. NOBODY CAN'T TAKE YOU OUT.
[48:29] THAT'S MY ASSURANCE. Devil can WOLF DO
[48:32] ALL THIS WHAT HE WANT. ONE THING ABOUT
[48:33] IT, I GAVE MY LIFE TO GOD AND I I'M
[48:36] TRUSTING IN HIM THAT HE'LL KEEP ME. COME
[48:38] ON. I CAN'T KEEP MYSELF. IT'S GOD DOING
[48:41] IT. HALLELUJAH. OH, I'm trusting in God.
[48:44] Hallelujah.

[48:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting in him in his presence.
[48:51] Hallelujah. You can have all THE
[48:53] EXCITEMENT, ALL THIS. COME ON. I'M
[48:54] TRUSTING IN THE presence of God. Right.
[48:56] Come on. BECAUSE I KNOW ONE THING.
[48:58] That's what gives me courage. Right.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; That's what gives me faith to know that
[49:03] it ain't no no uh uh uh trial that'll
[49:05] stand before us that'll BE ABLE TO
[49:07] DEFEAT US. AMEN.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PRESENCE IS THERE.
[49:10] HALLELUJAH.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; You know, one thing I I was sharing with
[49:14] the church the other day. I I tell a
[49:16] testimony sometimes. You know, we were
[49:18] at work and uh we was we was talking
[49:21] about how many of times people made
[49:24] commitments to God, but they didn't keep
[49:26] keep those commitments, right? Because
[49:28] they were in situations and they said,
[49:30] "Lord, if you ever get me out of here,
[49:32] I'll serve you. I'll never come back."
[49:34] But you know what happens many of times?
[49:37] God delivered people and what do they
[49:38] do? They forget all about the God that
[49:41] delivered them. But in their time of
[49:43] need, they called on God, didn't they?
[49:45] With all their heart. And one thing
[49:46] about it, you know, God knows all
[49:48] things. He knew you wasn't going to keep
[49:50] serving him.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; But yet, he's all merciful. He delivered
[49:53] you anyhow, didn't he?
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. I said, how good does God be to
[49:57] you?
[49:58] &gt;&gt; How many times God got to bring you out?
[50:00] One time you may call on him AND HE MAY
[50:02] NOT BE THERE. [screaming]
[50:04] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THAT'S THE TRUTH. Come on. But
[50:07] I thank God. Hallelujah. That I know
[50:09] that if I'M STANDING IN HIS WILL, I CAN
[50:12] CALL ON HIM. AND THAT'S A PROMISE THAT
[50:14] HE'LL BE THERE [screaming] EVERY TIME.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; But I was sharing I said, you know, one
[50:22] thing about we was talking about that at
[50:24] work and one of the one of the guys,
[50:26] older guy, uh he was saying that he was
[50:28] over in um in uh uh Vietnam and said,
[50:33] "Man, they they had this Vietnamese
[50:35] start shooting at them and said um came
[50:38] out of nowhere, bunch of people, he says
[50:40] from South Carolina was in the platoon
[50:42] and he said that a bunch of them got
[50:44] killed like shot up. Shot up real bad."
[50:47] He says he was laying so low to the
[50:48] ground. He was trying to dig a hole for
[50:51] himself with his fingernails to all his
[50:53] skin was raw and bleeding. And he said
[50:55] he can hear those bullets whizzing by
[50:57] his head. Say he can hear the boys next
[51:00] to him getting chewed up by the bullets.
[51:02] And he says next thing you know he began
[51:04] to pray into himself right then. He
[51:07] said, "Lord, if you get me, let me make
[51:09] it out of this." He says, "I'll serve
[51:11] you when I get back to the States
[51:13] through the all my life." He was he was
[51:15] young then at the time. And then he says
[51:18] after he got done praying, he said he
[51:20] felt like a warmness come above him come
[51:23] about him. He says he don't know what he
[51:25] said he just felt warm all of a sudden.
[51:27] And he said though the bullets was
[51:28] flying past his head and he's so low he
[51:30] just stood up to his feet and just start
[51:32] shooting back at everybody at the enemy,
[51:34] right? And he says not one bullet hit
[51:36] him. He didn't get a scratch, you know,
[51:38] other than what he was trying to dig out
[51:39] there. And he was saying that for some
[51:41] reason well after he got done praying
[51:43] the warmness came right and all the fear
[51:46] left and he started doing things that
[51:48] you would think like oh that's just
[51:49] adrenaline but you know WHAT I BEGAN TO
[51:51] TELL HIM THIS WAS BACK THEN I SAID YOU
[51:52] KNOW ONE THING THAT WAS THE presence of
[51:54] God. Hallelujah.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; COME ON PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IT
[51:57] SOMETIMES BUT IT WAS THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.
[52:00] WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE? THE PRESENCE
[52:02] of God. HALLELUJAH. THOUGH THE BULLETS
[52:04] WERE ALL AROUND YOU THOUGH THE ENEMY
[52:06] SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU THE PRESENCE WAS
[52:08] THERE. WHAT BROUGHT ON THE PRESENCE?
[52:10] SOMEBODY WAS [screaming] PRAYING.
[52:12] HALLELUJAH.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; OH JESUS.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Praying brings the presence, don't it?
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; And it creates a shield around you.
[52:20] Hallelujah.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. I BELIEVE THAT EVEN EITHER DAY
[52:23] IN 2025, THE PRESENCE STILL WORKS,
[52:26] RIGHT? I mean, THE PRAYER STILL WORKS.
[52:29] PRAYER STILL BRINGS THE PRESENCE. COME
[52:31] ON. WE GOT TECHNOLOGY. WE GOT ALL THESE
[52:33] THINGS. WE GOT OTHER avenues that's
[52:35] supposed to be ways out, WAYS OF ESCAPE.
[52:37] BUT CAN'T NOTHING BEAT THAT PRESENCE.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; THAT PRESENCE WON'T FAIL YOU. COME ON.
[52:43] HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN SAY HE'S
[52:45] HERE. [screaming] HALLELUJAH.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. BECAUSE HIS PRESENCE IS HERE.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW I KNOW. HALLELUJAH. Oh Jesus.
[52:53] Come on.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, I said when he
[52:56] was sharing that, I was telling him
[52:58] that's what that's what it is. The
[52:59] presence was there. Come on. AND WHEN
[53:01] THE PRESENCE THERE, come on. Miracles
[53:03] happen. That's right.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Excitement don't
[53:07] bring miracles. The presence does. Come
[53:10] on. Excitement. IT IT IT IT DON'T DO DO
[53:13] the miraculous. The presence does.
[53:15] Hallelujah.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The the the excitement don't
[53:20] bring joy. The presence does.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. And come on. In the PRESENCE OF
[53:24] THE LORD, THAT'S THERE'S FULLNESS OF
[53:26] JOY. THE PRESENCE BRINGS THAT, don't it?
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. How many believe
[53:30] that tonight? Come on. But one thing I
[53:32] say, you need the presence.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many found that out that that
[53:37] without the presence there wasn't
[53:38] nothing, didn't he? Come on. Samson
[53:40] found that out one day, didn't he? Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. He might have been doing this
[53:45] and had many uh testimonies and of how
[53:48] the Lord used him and all and thought
[53:51] maybe at one point that he can do what
[53:53] he want because God used me so many
[53:54] times, right?
[53:56] &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, he didn't
[53:57] realize that without their presence, he
[53:59] wasn't nothing.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; But he found out one day, didn't he?
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. on when the presence had left
[54:04] him. Hallelujah. And he said, "I'll go
[54:06] shake myself at other times." But he
[54:08] didn't know that the presence had left
[54:10] him. And when he went out, then he
[54:12] REALIZED HE WAS NO MATCH FOR THE DEVIL.
[54:14] COME ON. AND NEITHER ARE YOU AND I
[54:16] TONIGHT. NO MATCH FOR THE DEVIL UNLESS
[54:18] GOD [screaming] BE WITH YOU. AND IF GOD
[54:20] BE FOR US, THEN WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?
[54:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THAT'S THE TRUTH. HALLELUJAH.
[54:26] THAT'S WHY WE PRAY ALL THE TIME, LORD,
[54:28] don't take your hands off me.
[54:30] Hallelujah. Oh God, create in me a CLEAN
[54:33] HEART AND RENEW THE RIGHT SPIRIT in me.
[54:35] COME ON. DON'T [screaming] LET YOUR HOLY
[54:36] SPIRIT LEAVE ME, GOD.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON. BECAUSE THERE'S MANY THINGS YOU
[54:40] CAN DO TO GET THAT PRESENCE TO WALK AWAY
[54:42] FROM YOU.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. Sin brings that
[54:47] about, DON'T IT? DISOBEDIENCE BRINGS
[54:50] THAT ABOUT.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, REPENTANCE
[54:52] [screaming] WILL BRING IT BACK.
[54:53] HALLELUJAH.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; That's one thing people don't like to
[54:56] do,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; do they? Is to repent. Come on. on. But
[55:00] it'll bring it back, won't it?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Not not these dry eyes and all that. The
[55:06] Lord know your heart, don't he?
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. But a real Hallelujah. I
[55:10] believe like Samson, we was talking
[55:12] about that the other week with the young
[55:14] with a young little group over there. I
[55:16] said one thing about him, he didn't have
[55:18] his eyes, did he? But he still had
[55:21] memories. He still had things he can go
[55:23] back to. And I said, I believe that when
[55:26] they was out there making fun of him,
[55:27] maybe what was he thinking about that
[55:29] whole time? Come on. When he was
[55:31] grinding in the meal, MAYBE HE WAS
[55:33] THINKING ABOUT THE GOOD TIMES.
[55:34] HALLELUJAH.
[55:36] When he was going and and next thing you
[55:38] know, come on, God begin moving in his
[55:41] life. HOW DID GOD BEGIN MOVING IN HIS
[55:43] LIFE? BECAUSE WHEN the enemy or danger
[55:46] seemed to come about, COME ON, THE
[55:48] PRESENCE WOULD BE THERE.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; MAYBE HE THOUGHT about when a young lion
[55:51] came after him. Hallelujah. WHEN
[55:53] EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD RUN, THE PRESENCE
[55:55] CAME. HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. And when
[55:59] that came, instead of HIM RUNNING, HE
[56:00] [screaming] GRABBED THAT LION AND TORE
[56:02] HIM UP, DIDN'T HE?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; COME ON. Don't seem real, does it? But
[56:06] when the presence of God is there,
[56:08] everything is possible. HALLELUJAH.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; THE IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE WHEN THE
[56:12] PRESENCE IS THERE,
[56:13] &gt;&gt; ain't it?
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even though he he WAS STANDING
[56:18] THERE NOW WITH HIS EYES OUT, HAIR shaved
[56:20] off, but the Bible says hair begin to
[56:22] grow back again.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. But even with the hair growing
[56:26] back, he still needed the presence.
[56:28] Hallelujah.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. WHAT BROUGHT IT BACK?
[56:31] REPENTANCE, DIDN'T IT? I CAN SEE THAT.
[56:34] YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT IT, I believe
[56:36] that he can see where he got off. Come
[56:40] on. IN HIS MIND, I BELIEVE HE CAN START
[56:43] BELIEVEING ABOUT WHERE HE GOT OFF.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; COME ON. HIS PARENTS WAS TELLING HIM
[56:48] MANY TIMES, UH, I WANT THIS YOUNG
[56:50] [screaming] GIRL. WHY YOU DON'T WHY YOU
[56:51] WANT HER? COME ON.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; AND ALL THESE SANCTIFIED JEWISH HOLY
[56:57] GIRLS. YOU DON'T WANT THEM. OH, I WANT
[57:00] HER. I BELIEVE HE THOUGHT ABOUT those
[57:02] things.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:05] COME ON. WHERE HE GOT OFF, RIGHT? LITTLE
[57:08] BY LITTLE TO TO THE POINT TO WHERE LOOK
[57:10] AT WHERE I'M AT NOW. RIGHT?
[57:12] &gt;&gt; BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, HALLELUJAH, I
[57:16] BELIEVE HE LONGED FOR THAT PRESENCE TO
[57:18] COME BACK. RIGHT?
[57:20] &gt;&gt; LONG FOR THE I WANT TO [screaming] GET
[57:22] BACK IN YOUR WILL, GOD. RIGHT?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GET BACK TO THAT PLACE TO
[57:25] WHERE YOU COULD USE ME AGAIN.
[57:27] HALLELUJAH. I WANT TO [screaming] KNOW
[57:29] THAT YOU'RE STILL HERE, GOD.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY. COME ON. HE WAS WILLING TO
[57:34] REPENT, RIGHT?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. HALLELUJAH.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; He told that you're a little young lad
[57:40] to lead him. Lead him, right? LEAD HIM
[57:42] TO THE POST, THE PILLARS, RIGHT? LEAD ME
[57:43] THERE. COME ON. BUT IN THAT PLACE, HE
[57:46] SAID, "LORD, STRENGTHEN ME JUST THIS
[57:48] ONCE." RIGHT. ONCE MORE. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[57:52] I want to feel the PRESENCE OF GOD.
[57:53] RIGHT. [screaming]
[57:54] &gt;&gt; OH, THE EXCITEMENT IS GONE. I WANT THE
[57:56] PRESENCE ONE MORE TIME.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I believe you got TO GET
[58:02] THAT DESPERATE TONIGHT. THAT WAY YOU
[58:04] WANT THE PRESENCE AGAIN. AMEN.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; COME ON. God let things go on wrong, but
[58:08] he know one thing. One day you'll need
[58:10] that presence again. Right.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that tonight?
[58:14] &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, when the
[58:15] presence came. Hallelujah. That made the
[58:18] difference, didn't it?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; That's why I say it takes sometimes
[58:23] God does things or let you go into
[58:27] certain things. It takes things to
[58:28] happen for you to realize how important
[58:31] the presence is.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU CAN DEPEND ON YOUR OWN
[58:35] ABILITY AND ALL THAT, but you ain't
[58:37] nothing without the presence.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Without him, you can't do nothing.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. That's why we often
[58:45] pray, Lord, keep me in your your
[58:47] pathway, Lord. Like to say, keep me in
[58:49] your will. KEEP ME IN YOUR PATH, GOD.
[58:51] LET ME STAY IN THERE.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Because the more God blesses, SOMETIMES
[58:56] PEOPLE FORGET, DON'T THEY? That it's God
[58:59] that brought them. But I said, "Lord,
[59:01] I'll never want to forget that it's you
[59:03] that brought me. That it's you that's
[59:04] keeping me. That's you that's MAKING A
[59:06] WAY." COME ON. I need your presence
[59:09] right now, Lord. Come on. How many need
[59:11] that presence tonight?
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. Many, his presence makes a
[59:15] difference. I THOUGHT ABOUT PETER NOSE
[59:18] AFTER THEY DONE BEEN ALL NIGHT. They
[59:19] ain't caught nothing, right? But Jesus
[59:22] began to tell them, "I want you to go
[59:23] out again." Come on now. WE KNOW WE
[59:26] EXPERT FISHERMEN. THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
[59:29] Come on. WE KNOW WHERE THE FISH WERE AT
[59:31] AND THEY WASN'T THERE. But one DIFF ONE
[59:34] OF THE difference is this time Jesus was
[59:36] going to be WITH THEM. HALLELUJAH.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; HIS [screaming] PRESENCE WAS GOING TO
[59:39] MAKE THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME, WASN'T
[59:40] IT?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
[59:43] TODAY, [screaming] RIGHT?
[59:45] &gt;&gt; YOU DONE DID ALL YOU CAN DO. YOU DONE
[59:47] TRIED.
[59:49] Come on. YOU DID YOUR BEST.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; AND IT FAILED. RIGHT.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; THIS TIME, [screaming] LET JESUS GO WITH
[59:56] YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WATCH WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT
[59:59] MAKES. HALLELUJAH. It makes a big
[1:00:01] difference. How many believe that
[1:00:03] tonight? Oh Jesus. I'm stirred. Come on.
[1:00:05] The presence of God. It makes a
[1:00:07] difference, don't it?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Jonah, like we said, was fleeing the
[1:00:10] presence, right? You know, Adam and Eve
[1:00:12] found out how much the presence made a
[1:00:14] difference, didn't they?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. When they got away from it,
[1:00:17] right?
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. And the voice of the Lord
[1:00:20] didn't walk in and say, "Hey, where are
[1:00:22] thou running from his presence?" Right?
[1:00:24] What made them run from it? because they
[1:00:26] had sin in their life, right?
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. They had disobeyed God, right?
[1:00:30] And that many times will make people
[1:00:32] don't want to be in that presence
[1:00:33] because that presence expose things in
[1:00:35] your life, won't it?
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. But one thing about it, I SAY,
[1:00:39] GOD, WHATEVER IT TAKES, LET ME GET IT
[1:00:41] RIGHT NOW. RIGHT.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. I WANT TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE
