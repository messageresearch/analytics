appreciate you for all of your goodness and your grace Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look at the book of Exodus by the grace of God Exodus 2 Exodus 2 and one you got it say amen and it reads and there went a man of the house of Levi and took a wife took a took wife a daughter of Levi and the woman conceived and bear a son and when she saw him that he was good a goodly child she hid him three months you may be seated want to read a little further down she she hid him three months and when she could no longer hide him she took him for she took for him an ark in of bull rush bull rushes and doed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the Rivers's Brink and his sister stood a far off off to Wi what would be done to him and the daughter of pharaoh came came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked Along by the Riverside and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the Babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the Hebrews children then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter shall I go and call thee a nurse to the Hebrew women of nurse of the Hebrew women that she may nursed the child for thee and Pharaoh's daughter said said to her go and the maid went and called the child's mother amen may God a blessed to the reading of his word this evening again tonight by the grace of God just for a moment I know we just going to start on this tonight and I wanted to I entitled it the power of of Satan the power of faith and the power of God Amen the power of Satan the power of faith and the power of God now we know that you know here in the scripture uh scripture reading and you know in Exodus and and what was here to take place in in the first Exodus we know the people were in bondage but God was getting ready to do something to get them out of that right because God had promised that he would bring them out so you know and it was time coming coming near the time for God to bring the people out of bondage so you know what happened here we saw three different we throughout the first Exodus you you'll see three different powers that's on display one is the power of Satan others power of faith and the power of God right but you know I says that even in we see that as it displayed in the first Exodus that's what's going got to be on it will be on display in this this last Exodus right you know I always say even though we saying the power of Satan Satan don't really have no power CU When Jesus rose he said all power is given unto me so when we saying the power of Satan is only what you you give him or you allow him to have over your life but outside of that he's powerless because Christ rose with all power you believe that tonight but we know that you know uh uh just in our scripture reading I says you know the devil one thing he does he always has a a way of trying to forerun what God is getting ready to do a lot of times he might not necessarily know what God is going to do but he know that something Supernatural or something major is about to take place so he always try to forerun it to do to try to either throw it off or or to try to stop it right but no matter how much the devil try or who he tries to use to throw off or to stop God from what he's doing is nothing he can do to stop what God want to do God is going to fulfill what he want to do and it's nothing that the devil can do about it right and that's why we thank I thank God because as we were uh preaching the last uh couple weeks on about how how uh great God is and and he's like he told them in Jeremiah you forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and how you know he can does he can do whatever he want he's he's not something you can contain how this great God is so you know just meditating on these things I says a lot of times the devil you know he'll use all kind of things he'll use sicknesses he'll use uh uh uh uh people out the job he'll use the political realm he'll use all kinds of things to stop uh uh to stop what God wants to do with you as an individual with the bride as a group but I says you know no matter what happens no matter what he does we're on the winning side we're on a one way trip y'all believe that tonight long as we stay in God's hand because God he can't fail but that's what it is so I I was looking at some things and I says you know I I begin to be stirred in my spirit I says you know what it what it was you know we find that I says you know in that day what did what did the devil do trying to use his power he tried to use pharaoh and some of the the the taskmasters and all of that day they want to kill all the men children throw them all in there in the in the river and all that all these things right to try to stop what God was was was getting ready to do but I like how the Bible says that you know they begin to afflict them and oppress them and make their lives bitter with hard bondage in the first chapter but it says the more that they afflict them the more they grew and the more they were blessed why because no matter what the if if if you're blessed by God as we keep saying when God blesses you you're blessed when the if God curse you you cursed too but if God blesses you you blessed the devil tries to put weights on your pressures all these things on your life but now if you give him that type of power over you you know and get in your mind and think that you you're not able CU of giants in the land and all these things then you'll be just like they said uh uh in in numbers you know they saying we in our own eyes were as grasshoppers in their sight in their own eyes but when you're not looking through your own eyes when you're looking at who's made the promise to you when you're looking at the what you got going on in your life you look at who who called you I didn't call myself not not just necessarily talking about the ministry but called you to be a Son of God I didn't call myself I like how you know the prophet God was talking about you know somebody made a statement once that you know the devil put us in the pwn shop out but God came and redeemed us out come on and that's and that just just sitting there meditating on it how the devil might have had somewhat claims on your life when you were born cuz you were born in bad shape and all those things but it's one thing about it the Redeemer has come and he had paid the price right so when he come it's the devil can't hold you the devil can't hold this all your life or do all these things because God has already paid price for it come on and you and he just coming back to get us he's coming back to redeem us he's already redeemed us but he's coming back like I says he's already he's already can't really get it off like I like I was it was in my spirit but he he's already redeemed us God is we like I said the power of God the power of faith I mean the power of Satan the power of God and the power of Faith the power of of Satan he's just trying to you know hold things over your grip You by fear the Bible talks about that that you know we don't have fear over in you know I wrote the scripture down but you know it says that and we we're not of those that you know have fear right over in nobody didn't just wrote it down but you know in 1 John 4:18 says you know let's let's turn around and let's look at that 1 John 4:18 God is good amen trying to trying to just go a little slow because I know it's I got a lot I want to say but I can't I won't be able to say it all so I don't want to just jump all over myself but I'm just trying to trying to I guess get get get your mind to start thinking right CU God been doing something with me in my spirit it's just to have you start looking at everything different now because God is in control no matter what God is in control I was telling charl at the other day I saying you know I say and I said don't fret certain things don't fret that I said God got you God going to take care of it don't fret that don't fret that as I was telling brother Gordon that last week something don't fret fret not yourselves God is going to take care of you you blessed you know you you blessed from every wit because God has blessed you and if and if and if God is for you then who can be who going to be who can be against come on if he's on our side who's going to be against you when he says yes who can tell who can tell no who can say no come on who can stop you right we don't walk around like we it's because it ain't us we know it's God right we know it's God put you in certain places it's God that did certain things so you don't worry about trying to maintain this and that because God did it and everything God does is perfect am y'all believe that come on the Bible says he give and he take away but we going to still bless his name because even though he take away he he just making like he says the the tree sometime when they get purged it's just making making room for new fruit more right more to come I believe that y'all believe that tonight come on first John four by the grace of God four and is 18 you got it say Amen let's start the 17th verse he said herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in what love come on there is no fear and love y'all believe that and this is a strong topic to deal with but there is no fear and love right A lot of times people uh confess from their mouth got love love love but they veryy actions and 10 minutes later they'll they very words right because your like like I believe it was told U Peter one of those they said are you a Galilean he said no and then somebody said your speech betraying you and and it does even here today right but that's why I said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord is that your prayer tonight come on what what's in my heart God let what's in my heart be right all the time what you look at me might not look right sometimes but let what's in my heart be right because that's what's going to project itself on the outside come on y'all believe it and and a lot of times people they they really really concerned about the outside but in their heart they know things ain't right they know they got uh stuff in their heart and they they try to cover that up but remember God sees that God sees what's on the in that's one thing about it to realize that you are naked and open before God come on the word of God is quick and is powerful sharper any twoed sword it it can divide between those things those things you think are hidden they're not hidden before God so Lord God blessing me what stop the well up oh but those hidden things God sees those things the things you think hidden they're not hidden they're disarmed they're naked before God God seeing them right so the the think about the being a who he is then that causes you to want to walk it God the Holy Ghost checks your thoughts it checks your your words stuff you say the Holy Ghost got to check you amen you didn't say that right come on something's got to be there it's got to be he says he I'm the Lord I w't share my glory with no other I was talking with a guy last night CU I had to go back out to the job last night one of my I called him he was my friend but he was the one first he at this then he didn't uh then he believed in God but not Jesus and then he was all mixed up and then he and he say he don't believe in God and all these things but last night I was testifying about the goodness of God and he don't even realize it till right now I might tell him when I see him again Monday but he started praising God right there with me and talking about how good God was and won't he do it he don't even I was thinking I said he don't even know he cuz I was talking about some situations in his life and all and how I I said man I told my wife don't worry about it God got you I said man when you doing right you walking doing the best you can for the Lord God going to take care of you I said people devise evil devices and all kind of things against you come on don't worry about it I won't I won't be afraid of the Arrows by day or the teros by night David knew what he was talking about didn't he cuz he had so many enemies I like the scriptures says that that you know even uh uh when I'm you know I'm a little tired tonight but says you know when your enemies all around you come on in the presence of my enemies that's it he anoints my head with what oil come on he can do it your friends and all that but when your enemies is there come on in the presence you don't have to be afraid God is there with you when you you say your enemies it's nothing but the devil anyway y'all believe it tonight but I says that that's what it is it's no it's no uh fear here in the 18th verse said there is no fear and love but perfect love cast out what fear because fear hath what come on the devil coming to torment you we said the power of of Satan the power of faith and the power of God you can't have faith when when you got when you don't have love they work together you can't have it right not not real Faith perfect Faith come on somebody said well you said well they can move all mountains and all these things and and have not love yeah you know well you become as a sounding brass and tinkling symbol right but I says the thing is is that you know uh uh uh perfect love cast out fear don't it perfect love can't because fear when fear come that's the power the power Satan is holding over your life is fear you afraid of what's going to happen tomorrow you're afraid of this you're afraid this going to happen you're afraid that going to happen fear right come on that's the power you're holding over your life but I said it's a power of Faith out there and what faith faith doesn't it does doesn't fear like that what what what faith says is even though the doctors gave me this report the Bible says that he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed that's the Bible that's that's it is it's no Adder taken away that's it that's what God Said right come on he didn't go that distance for you and I but but he can't he can't heal you he can't do what he want in your life if you don't have faith if you don't believe him right if you don't believe that God is able to do it he you'll sit right there you know but once once you you grab a hold of something happens to you Faith takes over and then like it says the power of Satan then but when the power of Faith Comes come on then Satan you know cuz then what it is the power of Faith brings on the power of God I believe that come on it bring the power when you begin to believe it right that's going to bring on the power of God come on the devil used his power to kill all the boys and try to do all that storm in the river but when Moses mother had him they and his father they saw he was a proper child right so something Faith took hold in that home had to it that she hit him and when she couldn't hide him no more what the power of Faith do come on weave a basket for him and put them right in the river with like they say all the alligators and crocodiles or whatever it was right Faith did that didn't it but it brought that power of Faith brought on the power of God didn't it cuz when did the power of God show up soon as she put him in the river come on not a not a crocodile or whatever was in the river could touch that basket could it because now the power of God is taking over I've released my faith and now it's up to God to do what he said he'll do come on that's where we at come on the power of the Devils all that wounding and trying to scare you and all those things come on but I'm releasing my faith come on and I'm letting the power of God take over I know the guy one of the guys at work was telling me that he was saying that a friend of his had um he went to the doctor and he was just retired was all happy to be retired and he went to the doctor and this is some years ago now and the doctor told him I think he might have just went for a checkup or something and then they saw something and they said come back then they told him you got stage for cancer and his friend he said cried like a baby in the doctor's office went home and cried you know he died a couple of months after that but I says you know I felt kind of bad s to hear it but I said but we we're not as those that don't have hope come on fear fear fear got a way of of causing stuff prematurely y'all believe it fear got a away of of making situations way worse than what they are come on fear got a way of dragging you all the way down don't it but we are not we're not like that come on I fear can't torment you say I can't let fear torment me come on but I'm going to believe God come on don't he slay me yet I'll trust him if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory the word just start flowing out of you and then you say I'm going to release my faith cuz I'm not worried about death I'm not worried about sickness God already conquered all those things all of that was in Redemption y'all believe it come on healing was in was when when he died when he gave us life for you and I blood was shed you know when he redeemed us healing was a part of that come on healing was a part of that all those stripes and all healing was a part of that come on now you are you going to let the power of the devil hold you from keep getting what belongs to you what you're entitled to come on and the thing of is I can't do it on my own but what what what was what was Israel doing when they begin sing and crying by the reason of bondage they were crying unto God to keep a promise that he made their forefathers that one day you would visit us and they was crying and sign by the reason of bondage because now the time had come for deliverance right and God we're crying unto you because you promised us this is what you promised us and God God is faithful to keep his promise ain't it come on you look in the word and see all the Redemptive blessings that God has blessed you what are you fearing tonight what are you oh come on cry unto God sometimes I was sharing with somebody the other day I says to them I says you got to get victory over that situation I says what I said I I I dealt with that and I had to stay on my knees long enough to until I found peace with God and when you get up if you ain't got that that assurance that peace you need to get back down a little longer I was telling them and pray till you till you at peace with God on that situation cuz other than that the devil going to torment you you worried about the devil going to torment you saying oh you didn't do this right this right I says but once you've got down on your knees and you wrestled come on and you you you God the Holy Ghost comes and gives you you that Assurance gives you that rest and that peace when you get up I says then you don't deal with that situation no more because you put it in God's hand and God already took care of it you just walking you going on to the next trial to the next battle or whatever it is or walking in Victory because you put it over to God but one of the things I I saying to them you got to stay on your knees long enough come on we praying then stop praying and stop cuz cuz God some some situations I don't know about you but I had to come out to the church or get up in the middle of the night and just start praying I said Lord I'm going to pray I'm going to I'm going consecrate I'm just you just get down in there cuz you say Lord I need a word I don't want to carry this no more I'm ready to defeat this devil today and I don't want to deal with him tomorrow tonight I'm ready to feed him so what you do the greatest thing you can do get down your knees and pray tell God God I need your help Lord you said you move these mountains you told me to speak to them now I'm speaking Mountain get out of my way come on where there's depression sickness must said you don't know what I've been through one thing about it God knows every one of our situations stuff you ain't told nobody that you dealing with God know it don't you realize that God each and every one of us have things we're dealing with and and man probably don't never understand what you're going through you they may have a little compassion on you but to really understand what you're going through sometimes nobody will ever be able to understand it but what you got to realize is that Jesus you know God is he's touched come on the God that was above us came down and got in the body right that he could be God with us but he went back up and now he's God in us right in the form of the Holy Ghost ghost he's the same God but all those different manifestations that he he played his role in but it's no longer that he's God above you but he knows what you're going through he's he can be touched by what the feelings of your infirmities he knows what it's like to be rejected he knows what it's like to be be cast out he knows what it's like come on I said tonight God knows every one of our situations come on your situation God know your situation God know what you from The Young to the old God know your situation and he wants to help you come on but without faith it's impossible to please God come on without believing and letting it go putting it letting God have it it's impossible come on faith without works is dead right but Faith with Works come on come on God I don't know I said God I believe you God know God not only does he know our all of our situations but he knows what's up ahead he knows what's around the corner y'all believe it come on you know the other day I was tell us testimony I dreamed about a week or two ago that I got in a wreck and and I Dreamed A Car swerve and hit me out there on the interstate and uh you know it I started like to spin but then I woke up cuz you know I those dreams are I I don't know how it turned out cuz I jumped up out the bed like thank the Lord it was just a dream and uh but last week one day last week I think it was one day last week well week before I had a dream but I was coming home from from work right here on Interstate 20 and right there where they working on the road is getting tight before you get to bride River Bridge everything is getting tight and I'm on the the inside Lane so and it was a big you know 18 wheeler there rush hour traffic everybody moving I said you know I'm a you know you don't like to ride by those R beside those 18 wheelers you either want to be behind them or get on past them so I said I'm I'm I'm going shoot past this 18 wheeler and get out of his way but as I I hit the accelerator to go I heard something say to me uh be weary of the dream you had and I still started to go on past that truck but I said I'm I'm going take heed and no soon as I just I'mma back off you know that truck swerved over in my Lane I begin praising God in the car I said because the thing is God's got a way of warning us don't he a ain't you glad that he still shows you things to come come on now what you do are you going to take heed God still in he's still in that business come on say that's coincidence I don't not so come on I'm giving God all the glory cuz he even even at that time brought it to me and spoke to me about it right there in the car that's why we got to be keen on hearing God's voice it's a lot of voices out there but when when you get Keen to the voice of God you know it's him right it's it's unction from the Holy One and I said God that's what we need more than anything right but God still shows you things before it happens cuz why he's the same yesterday today and forever he didn't lose not none of his power as the years go on and the people have lost faith in the church today didn't they come on your faith should have always been in the word but the people have lost faith why because the the church today ain't no different from the world same stuff they just got religious spirits on them but you and I as as as Believers we want more than just church come on we need more than just church we need a God that's living a a a a God uh that's real come on because a paint and Fire won't do you no good when it's cold outside come on but you'll need the real thing right and he wants to give it to you remember God knows every one of our situations y'all I know y'all believe it come on but I say I want to read one more script I'm going to close I say it's too long anyway one more scripture here in um Mark 11 by the grace of God just wanted to that's you know stuff just started coming from everywhere Mark 11 but I say you know the power the power of Satan the power of faith and the power of God come on Satan try to hold things over you don't him fear and all but when When Faith Comes come on it brings about when it's real Faith it'll bring on the power of God come on and that's where we that's where we're coming to right now y'all believe it come on just like just like the devil used the Pharaoh knows and in Jesus uh day he used the Roman uh princes and all whatever the governors and all he used the you know the prophet of God is talking about the political realm he used all those to do what to try to stop what God was getting ready to do on Earth you know the Bible says that they was afraid and and and I was Herod and all those troubled all is and all the Jerusalem with him because you know they see those those men come and and they they coming looking for Jesus because they saw it starting and they coming to worship him right the King of Kings is about to be born God is doing something great in Earth but the devil knew it too he just didn't know what at some point right but what he always try to forun you know and then even in that day he used the he used those in that day to kill all the men from two years old and down all that but no matter how much he try to stop what God is doing he can't stop it God going to bring it to pass ain't it come on the devil triy to stop you know he said I have a bride without spot a wrinkle the world going on and on and on and going on it looks like like he said if time wouldn't be cut short no flesh should be saved but even in the midst of that he said for my leg sake right God will have himself a bride without spart or what wrinkle I believe it sometimes you might say well you know God it's all right I'm doing better than a lot of the other people that ain't good enough they that measure themselves by themselves as not what wise we got to Mark the perfect man which is what Christ Hallelujah Mark 11 by the grace of God Mark 11 and and 20 25 24 24 he says therefore I say unto you what things so soever you desire When you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall what have them now that's what Jesus said ain't it he said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them what's the use of praying if you don't believe that it's coming what's you praying your your your your family members your children and all these other things and then you get up and then they unel cuz the devil going to meet you as soon as you get up and they getting worse this happened this happened oh come on well Jesus said Jesus said this didn't he he said what whatever right so I said well they got to they got to get it for themselves but you can pray for them come on don't let the devil use the intellectual they got to you got to pray for them pull down strongholds come on I don't know I've been praying for my family lately my whole entire family God help them you know I said I said the thing is and I'll say it again people got struggles that you don't know about people are battle and a battle and they got things that happened to them you don't know about and it and they got wounds the Bible says a wounded spirit is hard to bear come on hard to heal or bear wounds people got wounds they got things that they ain't tell nobody about but like I said God knows all about your situation and he's here to heal all wounds but you got to let him right Hallelujah but it says here and and when you stand praying do what forgive that was a big one you know I meditated on this today for a long time and the other day he says when you stand praying forgive he says if ye art if you have art against any that your father also in heaven I mean also which is in heaven May forgive you of your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven do what forgive your trespasses come on sometimes say I forgave them but I ain't dealing with them no more it's your speech betray you something in your spirit ain't right come on we got to let we got to get our spirit right we got to let the Holy Ghost he going to keep poking at at that area until you get it right certain areas in your life he knows how to perfect you and he's going to keep poking at it till you get it right y'all believe it you make people run here go there and no matter where you go if you elect the seed of God and God got to get you there he going to keep poking at areas until you get it right come on I seen I read something here in the in the um in the Amplified version on this same scripture he's saying for this reason I'm telling you whatsoever things you ask in prayer in accordance with God's will believe with confident trust that you have you have received them and they will be given to you he says whenever you stand praying if you have anything against anyone forgive them drop the issue let it go come on it's just the Amplified version sometimes like to read it he said drop the issue right you you have anything he said drop issue uh let it go so that your father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions and wrongdoings against him and others come on not only against others but he said against him too against him and others but if you do not forgive neither will your father in Heaven forgive you your transgressions and we saying how how and and I was saying you know prayer I been listening to that song prayer makes the difference in my life or made the difference in my life prayer is one thing you got to have you can't make it without praying come on you can't get no ground covered without praying that's the weapon that God gives us to communicate even Jesus he went often to pray didn't he so that's one of that's one of the key things in your Christian Journey but that's the most fult hard thing fault ain't it but I'm saying even with that even if it's easy for you to pray right if you got something in your heart it don't do no good if you can't forgive if you if you got you know and I'm just I'm just cuz the Lord I just was looking at some things come on some say I prayed prayed prayed it look like heaven shut up well at my might be what you got in your heart cuz remember you doing all that praying and have faith in all the move mountains but it's as a sounding brass and tingling symbol come on but things can happen when you free with God when you drop the issue when you let it go and say God I want you to search me and try my reins I want to get right with you I want I want you to hear my prayer amen
