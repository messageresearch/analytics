give them what they stand in need of Lord of word and due season Lord we thank you we appreciate you Lord for all that you're doing and all your blessings toward us in the name of Jesus Christ amen god is good a man we want to look at the Book of Luke by God's grace Luke 19 and we'll begin at the between eight verse Luke 1928 and it reads and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to Jerusalem and he came to pass when he was come nigh to - Beth - Beth page Beth words and Bethany at the Mount called the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering you should find a Colt tied whereon yet never man set it loose him and bring him hit hitter and if any man shall ask you why do you lose him that's how you say unto Him because the LORD hath need of him and they went and they that were sent went their way and they found even as he had said unto them and as they were loosing the Colt owners thereof said unto them why I lose ye the coat and they said the Lord hath need of him and they brought him unto Jesus and they cast their garments upon the cotan is set and they set Jesus thereon and he's with and as he went they spread their clothes in a way and when he was come now even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of disciples began to rejoice and praise God with the loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest some of the rarest Pharisees from among the multitude said unto Him master rebuked our disciples and he said he answered and said to them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out and when he was come near he beheld a city and wept over it saying if thou has known even thou at least in this day that day the things which belongeth unto that peace but now they are hid from Dianna's for the days shall come upon thee that nine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compacity round and keep being in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and our children within thee they shall not leave be one stone upon another because thou knowest not the time of that visitation and he went into the temple and began to cast him out and sold therein and them that that ball saying unto the I mean is written my house is the house of prayer but yea meeting in a den of thieves and he talked daily in the temple but the priests did she priests and the scribes and a cheap people saw the chief other peoples sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear them may God to hear him may God had blessed her reading of his word you may be seated standing tonight by God's grace I just want to minister for a moment and I entitled it the days shall come the days shall come speaking here of Jesus and how he says here in the 43rd verse he says for the days shall come upon thee that dying enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compacity round about and keep being on every side and so you know we're seeing that the setting here of Jesus entering Jerusalem you know I say that he was in Jerusalem under a triumph under shouts of praise and you know the people crying out onto Hosanna you know blessed is he that coming to the name of the Lord that crying out unto Him and you know the reason why the shouts in the cries and appraises because of you know the Bible says that they were I guess we were paraphrasing just excited and stirred because of all the many wonderful works and the mighty things they had already seen out of Jesus and now here here he is coming to Jerusalem you know seem to be on the triumph but it was something you know that that Jesus he knew that you know that the world I would say he came to his own his own received or not so even though it seems that he was coming and triumph he knew that you know he would be standing there one day as a rejected team among them and the Bible says that he cried as he came and he wept over the city and he begins to say unto them you know the days is coming and he began to talk to him you know look at Matthew I believe it is 28 and he began to weeping over the city and talk about how he said God he said how God desired to gather you up under his wings as a hen doesn't chick he says but every every prophet in and great mighty thing that God sent in among you you rejected it you stoned you cast down but he says here he says the day is gonna come when your enemy is gonna go on camp about you when your enemy's just paraphrasing it would be so so Mario upon you and they would you know destroy you he said and at all it's gonna all be because he says that you didn't know your day of visitation you missed your hour your time you missed that you mister you might have been caught up in the mighty works and the signs and the wonders and and the things but you missed the very importance of what was among you but the Bible says that you know that that here he was saying he was saying in a 240 second verse if thou has known even though at least in that day the things which belonging to that peace but now they are hid from that ass see we know that just knowing about a scripture that the Bible talked about the Jews being blinded but God still had a remnant and the rest they were blinded you know so he says that you know they were blinded from those things but if you only had known you know what hour you were living in if you would only have known he said in this die day that was belonging to your piece if you only had known you know who was among then you know it could have been such more of a glorious or triumphant a time for you but you were blinded so the days we want to tonight by God's grace we want to dwell on he said the day you shall come you know I was thinking about that the other day and I was like you know how blessed it is we always talked about how we can come together how we could fellowship how we could come to the altar how we can have the prayer meetings how we could you know uh just enjoy the blessings and the things of God because of his spirit you know just being so fresh among you but it just came in my spirit the days will come where those times will be just a memory the days will come where you wish that you can make it to the house of God but you can't make it the days or come where you wish that you you can have the blessings of being able to fellowship together and or or to be able to get down on your knees and get a breakthrough but as he said to them you bit they missed a day of visitation they missed their hour they didn't realize what time and what day they were living in so they missed it but he said the days are coming you know I was thinking about I said I said what it is I said a little saying that they got it says you don't miss your water until your rail runs dry you won't know how important just that drink of water was until you don't have it no more and then you realize just importance I could say that it was a of how important things was were in your life or just what things meant to you until they be taken away and we find that I said you know in natural in in natural things you know in life you know we look at who says a wise man you know he'll try to he'll try to plan we say for the things of head for the things ahead because you know he knows especially if he live long enough he know that things change he know that people change he know that you have times and seasons and things thing always be the way that they are so what he tries to do is try to seize the moment an opportunity at a time that's right there before him that's what a wise men to do because he knows just like we says I was looking at I says you know that he said we saying all the time say that trouble don't last always but we know that even just as trouble don't last always those seasons of blessings to be cut out to it comes time you know when God is just out pouring his blessings and it's so rich but in those times when the blessings are being outpouring you know I beseech you by the mercies of the Living God to take full opportunity of those blessings I was thinking about I said God gives his people a way of escape we say sometimes a period of grace a chance to repent they get their soul right come on God said I come to visit you this day don't miss your hour don't miss your time don't miss that window or when the Holy Ghost is out pouring fresh come on when the time comes and God is yeah I says you know I you have to learn you know even within yo your Christian journey that windows when those times come when those blessings are falling sometimes you got to store up when the windows of heaven are open because when the windows are shut sometimes you might think oh I just got a touch oh that was enough but no I believe David didn't just want his cup just to be filled but he said I want my cup to run over come on when the windows of heaven are open I don't want just a little bit but I want more than enough I want enough that's once that I know that's gonna sustain me throughout the night because I believe that if that you know that the days are come where people are desire you know sometimes you know the word just becoming fresh just it's messy for the ministry the word come fresh to work God is just or the Spirit is just falling fresh your eyes is just beginning to open the things and you learn to cherish those times you learn to dig in those words you learn that it ain't always you can get down on your knees and pray but it's those seasons those cycles well you can get down on your knees and get that breakthrough it ain't seem like it ain't hard get down on your knees and all of a sudden the Spirit of God come down but that's in those times you want to store up you want to pray all that you can pray you want to get it all in you come on because the time will come when those when those windows will be shut we look at it like that those doors will be shut and you can't get that breakthrough but if you store it up you got enough to last you through that drought you got enough to last you through that cycle and that season come on when everybody else since it is going through heaven burden don't know whether they're gonna got enough to make it to tomorrow but you got enough when God has encouraged you that you know you got enough that's gonna last you got something that's gonna keep you it's gonna hold out why because when those times you stored up I was praying and I just something is ringing out in my my spirit he was saying store up come on store home get all you can right now cause the time the days might come come on with me and can't call on my name is they ought to as they desire they can't call them unnies and store up come on because the times ahead so we saw that and I says that you know it's something how Jesus you know like we said in turn on the triumph and even though they were glad to see them because of the mighty wonders and miracles Jesus wept over the city he said because they don't understand what's taking place among go they missed the hour they missed a day of visitation and I said it's something about when you miss out on God in the doors shut you think about those that were at the pool of a seder you know they they didn't want to miss they knew that at a certain season at a time the angels gonna come the trouble the water come on so they laid there day and night because they didn't want to miss their opportunity they didn't want to miss the time where God was gonna visit them so they stood there and they waited when that water was troubled they tried all they best to coming him get in why because they didn't know if the angel was coming back or when he was coming back so they wanted to they didn't want to miss their opportunity at air day of visitation they didn't want to miss the time where God was visible but we find that I said just as they had that sense of urgency I said lord give us a sense of urgency Lord coz I believe that even oh you know the Bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord or raise up a standard against you know we know that the enemy is coming like a flood come on it's perilous times everywhere it's things that's taking place and like I said they are you look and you say could only get worse from here but it's something about the Spirit of God that keeps you encouraged that you know that he said I never seen the righteous forsaken nor my seed begging for North Sea begging for bread you know that God is gonna take care of you God has come revised you but that faith didn't just come all about but you store it up God has worked out miracles little miracles little battles and little fights and then what it does is Thorn up something in you it built up a faith in you that you know that if God brought me to this like they say God will bring me through that God did something to store up something in you then give you faith in the in the uncle for the oncoming storm to receive victory how many believe that come come on let it say you don't miss your water to your well run dry the day is gonna come when you want to cry out to God but he won't be found come on the days will come where you wanna repeat give God your life and you wish that you didn't play with the opportunity when you had your the wish that you to seize that moment in that time when God was pouring out his spirit to yields your life to him and say Lord it's me god I need your spirit more now more than ever your wish the days are coming that you didn't just have it on your flesh just in your spirit but you opened up hallelujah and you let God engulf you down in the deep the depths of your soul you let God you did more than just conform to a church member but you had a transformation take place you had something down in the deep that no man no preacher no church cutting up root but though you let the Holy Ghost come in and clean out the room you wish you allow God to do something in your life I said I said the days will come come on you know looking at I said you know those are the times I think I said I said something's ringing out and my spirit says store up come on store up the days are coming I thought about those are the wise virgins I said the wise virgins they stored up come on because they knew that the bridegroom was coming they mighta didn't know when he was coming but come on I believe that they had enough spiritual discernment or something to know that hey he might come in the midnight hour and I mean if I got to go out and meet him I need more than just what I got in my lamp I need extra I need enough that when they're in the darkest of our is he come my light will still burn bright come on and that's what we say even today you need extra you need more that there in just not you can just be happy on Sunday or just when you come in the house of God but you need enough fire that'll burn even in the midst of your trial in the missile tribulation and what you're going through no matter what the devil put on you you got enough fire to keep burning you got enough light that when it seemed like the heavens is shut up for you come on you still got a praise on your lips you still got something deep down on the inside that's gonna cry out the Lord giving you take away but blessed be the name of the Lord I don't just have enough but I'm running over come on I believe that but we find that I says you know eat those times I think about I said those wise virgins come on they not only had all in laps but they stored up in a in a vessels as well you know you think about you know that those those foolish virgins that didn't have enough they didn't realize it until the cry was made that they didn't have what it takes come home to go out and meet the bridegroom they realize that the night was too dark and my lamp can go out and I ain't gonna be able to find my way come on they didn't they didn't realize that he would come in just in that time but when they went out come on and they tried to to buy of the oil in then when they came back the Bible says that the door was shut come on they missed a day they missed their hour of visitation because why they didn't have what it takes they didn't store up enough oil to go out and meet the bridegroom come on and I say I want to encourage you and I as individuals tonight come on store up come on this life that we live what is it like it says threescore and ten come on that God is all he really always would give you but even in that time that's no comparison to what concerning eternity is I will share with someone I says you got to make up in your mind that you love God more than anything that you want god bad enough you're willing to give up anything for him come on friends family money everything God you mean that much more to me God if I got to the wall the church if I got this whatever it takes God I'll give up anything Lord because I want you bad enough and you might confess that from your mouth but God knows just what's in your heart and he'll try you by it come on that very thing that's holding dear to you he'll try you buy it for you to prove whether you love God more than him in it and hear more than anything but when he when it comes to that person that's really sold out so that person that got desperate enough hallelujah and they say God I'm tired of the world and all that it has offer God I'm tired of being weak and powerless god I'm tired of going through in and out you don't have enough faith to get up out of the bed in the morning but God I'm turnt Lord when that person they say god I'll do anything Lord whatever it is God that you have on me God I'll do it well God knows when a person gets to that point I think about Jacob and how Jacob he had to get to that point that point of desperation that point to that place that he said I'm tired of running I'm tired of hiding the Esau is in front of me and I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow the Bible says that he feared him come on it says but I need something right now God he said I won't let you go until you bless me let me know everything gonna be all right when I meet my enemy tomorrow come on we get to those times the way we don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow and we begin to wrestling I say why wait there why don't you Russell now won't you get guarding now it in those times fear won't grip your heart but in those times you can stand or as a bowl soldier or the cross come on fighting the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life I believe that with all of my heart I said what God dude you know they're talking about you know riding this trail again you know I think about it I believe that the double portion is being our poor come on but what it is it might not be in the group but individual hearts somebody that's somewhere praying crying out because they realize that we don't coming storm you gonna need more than what you got you gonna have to do more than what you're doing you don't have to cry more than will you be crying out why because you need God how many believe that but we find that I says what it is you know you know with those foolish virgins you know we're talking about tonight the days shall come come on they missed their day of visitation I think about our slight Lord it just came to my heart I says when when will the people realize that is more than just in works come on or just in singing or just preaching tithing just coming to church it's more than that come on but it's the life of Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost coming down baptizing you changing you come on as a brother was preaching the other day where all things have become new creating in you a clean heart I mean you're creating your clean heart and renew a right spirit in you come on they the Holy Spirit can come down and fill you up giving you a new mind that when you walk out all old things are passed away but all things have become new now your mind is on only one thing and that's pleasing the Lord Jesus Christ no matter which way the world goes no matter which way the church goes and all those things but you have one of main objective and that's in pleasing the Lord God help me to be pleasing in your sight you know I was walking the other day at the job and I meditated that for I don't know how long just walking I said Lord whatever I do let the words from my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sights God the thoughts that I think let it be acceptable your sight the words that I speak Lord let it be acceptable in your sight all I want to do God is please you I think about inna the Bible say inna walk with God come on I believe when Enoch walked with God his main objective was Lord I want to please you God the world might be going deepening darker places but God I want to walk with you Lord I want to please you God it doesn't matter what everybody else is saying this is it's all right to do this come on but in my heart come on I want to serve the Lord it's ruled it it's embedded in me that God I want to please you amongst all God I want to give you everything Lord I believe the song said consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit God wants to burn up all the sin that's in your life God wants to burn out all the iniquity God wants to burn you up hallelujah that he can take place in your life he can have the full preeminence how many want to be consumed by the Lord your spirit come down again and consumers burn us up that I ain't thinking about myself God but I'm only thinking about you God what's pleasing in your sight that's what I want how many want that tonight come on don't miss your hour don't miss the day because the days are come will you wish that you took full advantage come on it's more than that I said but it was a life come on people realize that it's the Spirit of God that makes a difference come on you can have a beautiful voice but it's the noise and that destroys the yokes you can be intellectual and be able to articulate well but it's the noise in that you need it's the power of God that's why every time you're praying I said Lord that's what it is God I'm a can't even know what to say man go blink I said but God just send your spirit Lord I know your spirit that's gonna make the difference God not just a good sermon but God when your spirit comes it brings a word and season it bring something that's gonna destroy yokes that's gonna help somebody what they going through that's gonna break demon powers Oh somebody's life hallelujah and that's what we want I was sharing someone the other day they was telling me about a situation what's going on and and I said you know I said you know just like as Jesus said at one point these kind of come by fasting and praying I said sometimes you got to start make fast sometimes you got to get on your knees and pray because you within yourself you can't handle that situation you don't know what to do you only make matters worse so I said I learned in the Christian journey sometimes you can only just put up your hands get down on your knees and give it to God over in prayer and say Lord we've done all we can do now I'm taking my hands off the situation Lord I want you to handle it God come on I'm fasting I'm praying God is still Spirit that I need to come and take care of this situation and God to do it God are doing when he sees that you mean business it's in the Spirit of God that makes the difference I thought about I thought about Sampson come on and how you know after his hairs cut off and then they begin to tell him Samson the Philistines are upon you come on he might have felt the same he might have physically felt he did as a matter of fact because when he got up what did he say I'm gonna go shake myself just as I did the other times he felt like his old self he still felt like he was able to go out meet the enemy but he found out that it was just the anointing that made the difference you think about Samson in the Bible it didn't fail the mission and when every time when he came against any certain things the Bible said that the Spirit of the Lord came upon him come on and that's what made the difference the noise hallelujah no quickening power when it came he might have felt like he was still the same he might have felt like things were still all right but he walked out didn't know that God wouldn't with him come on I think about Ezekiel and I was showing them in the temple and it says look how the people lives are look at how they living and all that it says my glory is departed from them they would still go on doing the ritual but they wouldn't realize that the glory of the Lord wasn't there no more come on but they'd find out when their enemies came upon them and we find that even today sometimes we feel comfortable with just feel all going through the motion going through the rituals still going to church feeling a jump in the Shelf every now and then thinking that's all right but when the lie of show up come on when the enemy come what you'll realize then that it was the Spirit of God that she was missing it was the very life of Jesus Christ that made a difference hallelujah and that's what we need more than anything come on I says you know I was thinking about that how Ezekiel was saying it you know something about how I was talking about topic tonight the day shall come I was thinking about Ezekiel or how he was made a watchman he was looking he can see the condition of the people and he began to prophesy and told him and tell him what was coming ahead come on the day's gonna come come on the days is coming where God won't put up with the things you were doing no Mon God might've just give you a space and opportunity repent right now but the days are coming when your enemies is gonna be so much among you come on that some of you'll be scattered in the wind the ones that went destroyed by the fire or discord but I thank God even in that God still allowed a little grease come on but he says that in that time he said the day is gonna come where you wish you could've gave God your all the days will come come on in tribulation trial Jesus told him that when your enemies call him he gon have no mercy on you say he ain't gonna leave not one stone left upon another he ain't gonna leave the mother with the children but he gonna he gonna destroy them all come on the days of call me said why because you didn't know you're out you didn't know today you missed the hour of opportunity you miss that window your time of visitation with God want to do something special in your life just in that moment you know God is only required if he's only obligated to call a man once after that he can shut the door never call them again that's why when God begins to call him and tugging on your heart you want to give God all you got right then I think about the demand building the barns and he didn't know you know the Bible called him a fool didn't he says that you didn't know that just in this very night your soul is gonna be required and I said that's what it is the devil he got away he has a way of convincing people that they have time convince some people that everything gonna be all right especially to young you know he's got a way of doing those things that convincing you that you know everything gonna be all right you got enough time and all these things but not knowing that every man he's got at a point of time his days is numbered and when that's it that's it come on he that we talk about heat is holy let him be holy still in that day come on he that is filthy let him be filthy still I said God I don't want you to find me in myself or weeds in my Knicks here in my field but God I don't know I thought I'd you brought me too too far guard to leave me come on you know God has brought some of us do some great storm trials and some great storms God brought some of us off drugs brought some of us out of prison or whatever whatever life you know change was so dark in there things were holding you but God brought you all the way out God brought you through come on then you get to a place and your Christian journey the way you don't want to give God all you got the way you want to hold back on God after all God has done for you come on I said God you brought me too far come on not just say that he brought me this far to leave me come on let God bring you this far for you to leave him but let him bring you this far and say God whatever I got to do god I ain't gonna let you go Lord matter of fact God I don't want to adored you but it's saying that God's got a cook in me and I don't want to get it loose dog hold on the me Lord come on all things God hold on to me never never let me forget your grace remind me all the time of the mercies of God in my life remind me all the time daughter where I could have been well should have been God but what you've done for me me over those days lest I want to forget or what you've done for me God didn't what it would do it a cause a man to get back down on his knees again hallelujah repent even of his very thoughts God if I thought wrong Lord help me Lord because I know you've been too good to me Lord how many believe that today God has been too good to us I said the days shall come I think about that I says what it is you know Jesus he in here in the scriptures he was talking about it and how you know they didn't realize they blessing their opportunity and how he was saying how that they were blinded he was talking about how but we read here in the in the in the 42nd verse he says if you would only evaluate always known even listen this day this this day the things which belong to that peace but now he's talking about how their I hid it from their eyes and we know that God had a plan that he would even blind his own children that you and I could receive of that grace of God you and I who were without the camp you and I who didn't even wasn't even a County even wordly but God did all of that just so that you and I he would open our eyes come on that we'll be able to see who he is come on and I've said even in that God open in our eyes I said if you blind the dance because you willfully blind you shows you know not to see you fought past all those things I like us reading how the other week how the scriptures says that it was gonna come or the time was gonna come way to people they weren't going do her sound doctrine but they was gonna turn the air to fables come on it talks about in time that and I believe it was in Romans house says that when they when they knew God they worship him not as God but but a rather sort of creature more than the Creator going on about these things and then doing those things that they know that people are worthy of death not only do they do them but they have pleasure and knows in they have pleasure in them you know the Bible called him he talked about their minds come on being a reprobate it wasn't that they were born that way it wasn't that they were blinded the whole time but when they knew God their eyes were open they knew who he was but they chose not to serve him they chose the good to blind them so they chose their gold paths I said a lot of times people they know right from wrong they know things why because their very heart condemn them but they fight pass it any way they go pass it anyway why because they want to please the flesh more than they would please God come on but the days will come when they'll want to please God the days will come when they'll wish they had let it all go when they wished they had a turn they ear to what the Spirit of the Lord was saying the days will come what they'll realize just how important the Holy Ghost was the days will come but he says your enemies that be compassed all about you come on and he said all of this is because you didn't know you're out you didn't know your day you missed your time of visitation the time regarde was gonna do something great in your life come on I said don't miss your hour don't miss your time don't miss your season regard is giving you a period of grace but take full advantage of what God is doing even now amen but about what sister Robinson said to be ready be ready when he come again don't let him catch you what you work undone amen she says not get ready but be ready so by the grace of God we see the world in its condition we see South Carolina numbers are going up and now we have the hides count today 700 in something with virus and continually going up the governor says well let's open everything up even wider the numbers in the stores you can just anybody can go the bowl entirely open it up everything what do you do when you don't know what to do what do you do when you don't know what to do so I said stand still you know during this week of fasting and praying you know you praying for direction praying for guidance praying that Lord speak to our hearts and tell us what you want done and just know let us go through the motion we need to know what God wants to do in our lives what direction he wanted to take the church we thank the Lord for gear creek because they said they would like to sell us all the property all the way down to the railroad so by the grace of God and that's something we were dressing the Lord with twenty-something years but by the grace of God the different one says just claim it just claim and so by the grace of God we thank God for that I want to say don't get ready be ready the song said don't let him catch him with your work undone for he's coming again so soon so you be ready when they come again and I'm saying it's time for us to get our houses in order we said that we were going to have service and I think the brothers said they wanted to have it and inside on Sunday but the numbers are just go shooting up high and I think we're just gonna keep on right now on the outside and if people can drive up set up under the tent or whatever on side me 10:00 10:30 I want to say to you let's stay in prayer let's trust the law for leadership and guidance those that want to come out and come in the inside on Friday night you're welcome we just got a few on the inside so if you like to come on the inside on Friday night and we see that the numbers are getting up then we divide it some come one Friday know they come next Friday we don't know we're just praying and waiting on the Lord for direction and you just pray with us and let's just see what suede God many just said well and we're not gonna worry we're not wearing we just trusting the Lord to give us leadership and guidance and sometimes you have to stand still and wait on the Lord so we waiting on the Lord are you scared fear has told meetings of the devil I know some people that are going on to be with the Lord or whatever they said they're not fearing the virus but some of them just going on to be with the law one way or the other it's not fear but being why the serpent harmless is go and let's be wise sometimes you you're looking out for the person that think they got faith and don't have it and sometimes folk don't know how much faith they really have but they got faith servant of God says I you over there and he was able to point out certain people because
