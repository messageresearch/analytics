[41:10] when the lord thy god shall bring thee
[41:14] unto the land with thy goys
[41:18] to possess it and has cast
[41:21] out many nations before thee
[41:24] the hittites and the gertie sites
[41:29] and the amorites and the canaanites
[41:32] and the purging perdecites and the
[41:34] havaits and
[41:36] the jedi sites seven nations greater and

[41:41] and when the lord thy god shall deliver
[41:44] them
[41:44] before thee thou shall smite them
[41:48] and other that destroyed them thou shalt
[41:51] make no covenant with them nor
[41:54] show mercy upon them neither shall thou
[41:58] make marriages with them thy daughters
[42:02] thou shall not give unto them his son
[42:06] and nor his daughter
[42:09] shall thou take unto thy
[42:12] son for they will turn away
[42:16] thy son from following me that they may
[42:20] serve other gods so
[42:24] will the anger of the lord be kindered
[42:27] against you
[42:28] and destroy thee suddenly
[42:32] but thus shall ye deal with
[42:35] them you shall destroy their altars
[42:39] and break down their images and cut down
[42:43] their grooves

[42:51] the lord thy god and the lord thy god
[42:55] has chosen thee to be a special people
[42:58] unto himself above all people that
[43:01] are upon the face of the earth the lord
[43:05] did not set his love upon you
[43:08] nor choose you because ye were more
[43:12] in normal than any people
[43:15] for ye were furious of all people but
[43:19] because the lord loved you and because

[58:11] as he was the word made flesh
[58:15] it meant in the form of jesus christ to
[58:17] come in headshot form
[58:19] so we come in body form as the church

[1:00:37] express and open our mouths and say i
[1:00:40] love you amen
[1:00:42] it's hard because we try to be rough and
[1:00:44] tough
[1:00:45] isn't that right so it's difficult you
[1:00:48] know
[1:00:49] sometimes we come up in families where
[1:00:50] there's a lot of affection
[1:00:52] and then sometimes we come up in
[1:00:53] families we don't hear that word
[1:00:55] sometimes
[1:00:57] are you with me but you're in the family
[1:00:59] of god now
[1:01:01] he said because i love you
[1:01:04] that's why i chose you because i love
[1:01:08] you
[1:01:10] are you with me in other words you're
[1:01:13] special to god
[1:01:16] amen and the prophet of god said in the
[1:01:19] future of the trump and he said now
[1:01:21] you know what man would take his wife
[1:01:23] through the tribulation period
[1:01:27] he said because you love her amen
[1:01:30] and because jesus shedded his blood for
[1:01:33] you
[1:01:33] he's not but the church would go through
[1:01:35] uh tribulation but the bride amen
[1:01:40] you were the purchase of his blood god
[1:01:42] is not gonna take you through that
[1:01:44] amen he paid the price for you
[1:01:47] isn't that right
[1:01:51] your purge through the blood amen you
[1:01:53] don't need
[1:01:54] the great tribulation the tribulation
[1:01:56] period to
[1:01:58] encourage you or you will be
[1:02:02] so i thank god that we don't have to go
[1:02:04] through that triple
[1:02:06] but i believe that things are mounting
[1:02:08] up
[1:02:09] you know in in my prayer and in my
[1:02:12] uh gathering together this morning as i
[1:02:15] was out here praying

[1:02:40] god's chosen people because they were
[1:02:42] jews they were killed
[1:02:45] they meant they hated them because of
[1:02:47] who they were because they were
[1:02:48] they meant jews amen and folks will hate

[1:10:43] i said you know we were calling on jesus
[1:10:46] i started calling on jesus after a while
[1:10:48] i was speaking in tongues and i was
[1:10:50] praising the law
[1:10:52] and i was just speaking in tongues and
[1:10:55] and glorifying god and i didn't care
[1:10:57] whether
[1:10:58] he had an interpreter or not i was just
[1:11:00] feeling good
[1:11:02] are you with me so it's so
[1:11:06] and god began to speak to my spirit
[1:11:08] concerning certain things but i can't
[1:11:10] speak them now
[1:11:11] and but our god is good amen
[1:11:15] but the promise i said it would do good

[1:12:26] tower
[1:12:27] the righteous running into it and safe

[1:13:05] there's so many things together here but
[1:13:08] i want you to get the message that your
[1:13:10] promised land
[1:13:13] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:15] [Music]
[1:13:16] and the land where god wants to bring
[1:13:18] you into
[1:13:20] is into christ and in christ they're
[1:13:24] exceeding the precious
[1:13:25] promises that god wants you to possess
[1:13:30] are you open you know if i was a teacher
[1:13:33] i would take time and just
[1:13:34] break it break it break it break it and
[1:13:36] you'll be here three hours or four hours
[1:13:39] but i i try to give you enough that you

[1:13:50] tell you 25 different ways of saying the
[1:13:53] same thing
[1:13:55] just two or three ought to be enough
[1:13:58] but teachers have to do that because
[1:14:00] that's their gift
[1:14:02] my gift is to get it to you and you go
[1:14:06] home and study it
[1:14:08] and if you have any trouble with it come

[1:15:14] you would never fully understand what
[1:15:16] he's saying
[1:15:18] though you can believe it but the devil
[1:15:20] believed but he trembles
[1:15:23] amen you can try to live it but you
