of sorrow lord we can look up because we know that our redemption right now bless this family bless o god these that have come lord bless your word for we are trusting and depending on you now in jesus wonderful name we pray amen for just a moment we like to pause and thank god for mother tate amen we always she would always tell me i really really enjoyed that message and sometimes she would say i really needed that and um one thing about her before i could get some scriptures to finish she would finish it for me because there was something about the word that she had in the midst of all that she was going through she always had that word ankle in her heart that's why i can think about what david said thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee the interest of that word giveth life so we thank god for amen the word of god that meant so much to her and i said to myself what shall i say today in just a few moments we want to read a scripture and we want to talk to you about hope where would we be without hope hoped in god praise god not only do i hope that's in god our hope of eternal life here first thessalonians 4 reads but i would not 13th verse but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you saw or not even as others which have no hope see we suppose the sorrow if we have no hope it's a sad thing for a person to live in this world with no hope no purpose it says about hope hope is the favorable and confident expectation it has to do with the unseen and the future hope is described the happiness anticipation of good but when we talk about hope we're talking about hope of eternal life paul says in titus he said in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began god promised eternal life before the world began amen and do you know that god amen knew before the world began that you and i would need hope the right of hebrews he said god willing more abundantly to show and to the ears of promised the immutability of his counsel he said because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself that through the immutability of his counts is unchanged in council which god who cannot lie promise god made a promise to you and i and of that hope amen he talks about amen the hope that we have as an ankle of the soul both sure and steadfast and which enter into that within the veil we have hope brother sister amen we have an ankle praise god we have a reason paul says if the dead rise not amen praise god then is our faith in vain amen but we know that one day amen there is a resurrection of the dead amen so he said sorrow not as those that have no hope amen but we know that a christian has something that they are anticipating amen they are expecting one day what a weird underexpectation of he says for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep not dead them that sleep in jesus amen praise god those that sleep in jesus praise god we got to be in jesus we need to be in jesus somebody says i go to church somebody says amen i i'm a good member of the church but are you in jesus name amen if you hit jesus then the bible tells us by one spirit are we all baptized into one body amen it's whether we're in jesus i can't see a man having peace without a hope of eternal life amen a man amen amen he's in a uh chaos he's he's confused he don't know amen where he's going oh god i know he said one that starts falling out of this shame oh we don't want to be a wanting star we want to amen have an ankle we want to know where we stand know where we're going amen because we're on a journey and we're traveling somewhere and brother and sister we need hope to anchor our soul amen that's what gets us through our travel times oh god when we have trouble in the trials and textures and tribulation hope make us not ashamed amen because the holy ghost shattered abroad in our hearts when we got the holy ghost we got hope we got something to ankles oh god we got something in the inside hey man praise god god has positionally placed us in christ amen and when you're in christ you've got hope you've got jesus you've got hope amen if you don't have jesus amen you can have him today we need jesus he says with sleep amen it says for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even them that sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent we won't hinder what shall not prevent them which are sleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen with a shout and with the voice of an archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to me be with the lord amen to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord amen there's going to be a reunion one day praise god a family reunion for everyone amen that has the name of christ amen the name of jesus christ amen you must take on the name amen you must identify with his name because there's salvation in none other name unto heaven amen whereby we must be saved it's the name of jesus we need jesus today that's the name amen if you don't have his name praise god you're gonna need that name the name of jesus is the strong tower the righteous runneth into it and they are saved amen i want you to know that one day amen he'll call amen and you got to answer the call he called mother teeth the other day and her number was called she answered the call but when he called your number will you be ready amen if you're not ready then you need to take on the name amen how can you be assured of your destiny amen peter opened the doors to the church and he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost do you have the holy ghost do you want the holy ghost if you want it you can have it amen god gives you that assurance thank god for hope our hope is in jesus in his word and i thank god that the word of god amen was so real to mother tere and uh she treasured the word of god praise god she loved god's word she loved amen the songs the gospel amen she might have lost a lot of things but she remembered the words of the songs she remembered the scriptures amen she might have went through some things but thank god she had hope praise god she ain't meant hell to god way and i'm saying amen don't let nobody take the word away from you amen she held on to that word praise god i believe that's what took us 90 something years amen it's the word of god praise god and i believe if you got the word in your soul not just in your head but in your heart praise god and everything you feel he meant your heart began to testify i love jesus no matter what i'm holding to god's unchanging hand i know god cannot lie he made a promise and then he made a promise of eternal life and god keeps his promise god will not fail he'll keep his promises you can hold out a little while longer wait a little while longer and he that shall come will come it's coming back but will you be ready hope makes us not ashamed it's going to be a rapture we're going to be caught up are you going to be caught up that's the question now you try to get in the one that won't work you can get in but you won't have a wedding garment you got to come by the door jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father except you come by me you got to come by jesus let us bow father in jesus name you've given us hope and that hope makes us not ashamed hallelujah but i'm not ashamed of the gospel jesus christ for it is the power of god into salvation to everyone to believe what if some does not believe that does not make the word of god a non-effect the word of god one day the same word oh god that we loved so dear that word hallelujah would identify oh god with us one day and we'll say lord amen i had my opportunity but i turned it down but if you got your opportunity today don't turn jesus down if he's knocking at the door of your heart don't turn him down why don't you say lord you're welcome come on in god make your abode i want to know you oh he's alive and he'll keep you oh god when that day come that you got a cross john river you don't want any trouble at the river so i said you have an opportunity to receive jesus why don't you invite him in today jesus i want to make my calling and election sure i accept you now into my life and i want you to be lord of my life i accept you as my savior thank you for dying thank you for shedding your blood thank you lord i love you amen amen all power amen god is good he got all power in heaven and earth and if he has all power then there's nothing left but nobody else jesus got it all amen god
