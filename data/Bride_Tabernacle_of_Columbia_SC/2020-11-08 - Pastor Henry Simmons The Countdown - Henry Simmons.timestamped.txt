[33:43] [Music]
[33:46] matthew 24 and 1
[33:50] and jesus went out and departed from the
[33:53] temple
[33:54] and his disciples came to him to show
[33:57] him
[33:58] the building of the temple and jesus
[34:02] said
[34:02] unto them see ye not
[34:06] all these things verily i say unto you
[34:10] there shall not be left here one stone
[34:14] upon another that shall not be thrown
[34:17] down
[34:19] and as he sat upon the mountain
[34:22] of olives the disciples came unto him
[34:26] privily
[34:28] saying tell us when shall these things
[34:32] be what shall be the sign of thy coming
[34:36] and of the end of the world may god
[34:40] bless the reader which word you may be
[34:41] seated
[34:45] the question was in the conclusion
[34:51] concerning the end of the world because
[34:54] it was something
[34:56] that they knew were it
[35:00] was to happen the end of the world was
[35:03] to come
[35:05] when we talk about the end of the world
[35:07] we're talking about the cosmos the world
[35:09] order
[35:10] that we know the world system as we know
[35:15] one day it would come to an end
[35:18] peter 4 seeing it he said i saw
[35:21] they meant the world being on fire the
[35:25] elements
[35:26] melt with the fervent heat he saw that
[35:29] this
[35:30] cosmos the world system would be burnt
[35:32] up
[35:36] but he said nevertheless we according to
[35:39] his promise look for a new heaven
[35:42] and a new earth way in dwelleth
[35:44] righteousness
[35:46] god amen he said it's not slight
[35:50] concerning his promises
[35:53] as some men do count slackness
[35:56] but he's long suffering to us lord
[35:59] not willing that any shall perish but
[36:02] that all should come to repentance
[36:05] i trust this morning that we are come to
[36:07] repentance
[36:09] amen that the long suffering of god
[36:13] is salvation amen god is suffering
[36:17] long for he knows them that are his
[36:22] god is waiting on that last election to
[36:25] come in
[36:27] before the door is shut
[36:30] amen and there'll be no more coming in
[36:34] because one day it'll all be over
[36:38] talk to you this morning concerning the
[36:40] countdown is on
[36:44] the countdown many years ago
[36:49] god's servant talks about three minutes
[36:51] to midnight
[36:55] the world's scientific world
[36:58] had determined that amen
[37:02] it was three minutes to midnight and
[37:05] oftentimes those
[37:07] terminologies are changed concerning the
[37:10] events sometimes
[37:11] they're put and hold or just a man in
[37:15] check
[37:16] stalemate and just stand still for a
[37:18] while
[37:20] then all of a sudden is there's a a stir
[37:24] again and i said it's later than we
[37:27] think it is
[37:33] the countdown is on
[37:38] the president-elect biden
[37:42] realized the condition of the world
[37:48] and he realized that if the world does
[37:51] not get help
[37:56] that it'll all be over
[38:01] europe and germany and all over
[38:04] the world they meant the virus
[38:08] looked like it's taken another turn
[38:14] and now if man cannot handle
[38:18] this virus quickly and shorter
[38:24] than the world as we know would be no
[38:26] more
[38:29] we will go into other chaos
[38:34] because the economical system was
[38:36] crashed
[38:42] we have to do something about
[38:45] the condition
[38:48] the countdown is on
[38:52] they said many times it's three minutes
[38:55] to midnight
[38:56] i said it's almost midnight
[39:00] we're almost there brother sister we
[39:03] almost
[39:06] we can start counting down now
[39:10] how long will it be before it's all over
[39:19] but the countdown for you and i
[39:22] zoned for the rapture
[39:28] countdown is owned for the great battle
[39:32] of armageddon
[39:36] president-elect biden says that
[39:42] we're going to depend on the scientific
[39:45] world
[39:47] to give us an ounce and solution to our
[39:52] problems in the environment
[39:57] and in the virus
[40:00] folks are looking for a solution
[40:04] we got to do something to stop it
[40:09] we cannot take too much more of this
[40:15] i'm saying brother and sister
[40:19] when will we get in panic move
[40:24] when will we get to a place that uh they
[40:27] meant the world is
[40:29] getting in planet moon where they'll do
[40:32] something drastically
[40:36] see when you panic sometimes you do
[40:39] something that
[40:40] you would normally do
[40:45] and sometimes you will try to help
[40:48] yourself
[40:49] but you end up hurting yourself
[40:55] sometimes when the house is on fire
[40:59] instead of escaping the fire sometimes
[41:02] folk
[41:03] will run into the fire
[41:07] when you win panic move
[41:11] i wonder when will
[41:15] the people of the earth and the
[41:18] political leaders in
[41:21] the world scientists get in
[41:24] pain and move so they'll try
[41:28] all kind of remedies
[41:32] i wonder if the president-elect biden
[41:36] would say
[41:37] uh this time amen like it was inanimal
[41:43] amen the king says let us all
[41:47] not eat not of our animals not any man
[41:50] or any beast and he put on
[41:54] sackcloth and ashes let us all
[41:58] repent
[42:01] let us stop amen for a moment and
[42:04] ask for god's mercy
[42:09] let us stop for a moment and say god
[42:12] amen forgive us oh
[42:15] spares lords
[42:20] but man go as far as he can go
[42:24] with his scientific experience
[42:28] experiments and he'll try
[42:31] all he can to save himself
[42:37] without the savior himself
[42:42] brother and sister amen the world needs
[42:45] a savior
[42:48] but they don't want jesus our savior
[42:53] they turned down the one the answer
[42:58] they're trying to get a solution but i i
[43:01] said
[43:02] if this pandemic and this virus is over
[43:06] i said there's another one on the way
[43:11] and if they get a handle to the
[43:13] economical
[43:14] situation it's another one on the way
[43:18] so i'm saying brothers and sisters we
[43:21] need to understand
[43:23] that you and i that have turned to god
[43:28] we turn and put our trust
[43:31] in our confidence in god
[43:35] god is the answer what will folks accept
[43:39] jesus ah
[43:43] it's something let me say this
[43:47] the countdown is on
[43:51] the out that are breathing
[43:56] we'll come to a crisis with the air
[43:59] pollution
[44:01] we don't do something to stop the
[44:03] pollution of the air
[44:06] and the water then there would be
[44:10] amen it would be so contaminated
[44:14] they meant to we can't breathe
[44:18] not putting your knee on a black man and
[44:21] said i can't
[44:22] breathe but the whole world is getting
[44:26] the condition that the air is so
[44:29] polluted
[44:31] amen that it would actually cause men
[44:35] to die water that we're drinking is so
[44:39] contaminated will be no answer
[44:47] i was glad to see the young children
[44:49] sing today
[44:52] and trusting that there is a future for
[44:54] them
[44:56] they meant to take over amen the
[44:59] position of
[45:00] myself and brother gordon and brother
[45:02] germa the young people can really come
[45:07] and there'll be a future for them but i
[45:10] don't know
[45:11] this morning whether there is a future
[45:15] i believe that is later than we think
[45:18] the countdown is on
[45:23] here which says the countdown for you
[45:26] and i
[45:27] is on for the rapture it says in
[45:30] revelation 19
[45:32] for a moment revelation 19 7
[45:36] it says let us be glad and rejoice
[45:41] and give honor to him for the marriage
[45:44] of the lamb has come
[45:46] and his wife has made herself ready
[45:51] amen
[45:54] his wife has made herself ready
[46:00] the countdown as we look at it
[46:06] in the days of martin luther in the
[46:08] reformation of justification
[46:14] looked like the corner wheat had fallen
[46:16] into the ground and died
[46:19] but it began to spring up in a blade
[46:21] form
[46:24] when uh men were in such darkness
[46:30] under jezebel religion
[46:35] so here we are emerge
[46:39] the just shall live by faith and we
[46:41] don't have to be under
[46:42] all kind of dogmas in creeds and under
[46:45] the barnache
[46:50] a man made traditions and rule
[46:54] martin luther had a reformation on
[46:57] and that was the just shall live by
[47:00] faith
[47:04] light began to come back
[47:07] to the body that was dead
[47:12] amen so life began to come back
[47:16] under amen we look at
[47:20] the horse and buggy days
[47:24] then from the horse and buggy we begin
[47:27] to increase
[47:30] until the automobile age
[47:34] the automobile age and we will find in
[47:38] wesleyan the methodists
[47:42] they had a hole in this standard it came
[47:45] to a time that the church went through
[47:50] sanctification
[47:52] sanctification did not deny
[47:55] justification
[47:59] it came now that after you save you need
[48:01] to live a clean
[48:02] life god amen
[48:07] said the countdown is on where are we
[48:10] going
[48:11] brother and sister we heard it for
[48:13] rapture
[48:15] we had it for rapture
[48:19] how are we going to get there we got to
[48:22] come through
[48:23] justification sanctification
[48:26] after that event we find that we went
[48:29] from
[48:31] the hearts and burgers meant to the
[48:33] automobile
[48:35] and from the automobile we began to
[48:39] the wright brothers and began to fly in
[48:42] the airplanes
[48:46] on the juice of the street
[48:49] black man by the name of seymour
[48:54] amen began to take the church to a
[48:57] higher level
[49:00] that when the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:02] began to fall
[49:03] and the supernatural began to happen and
[49:06] the gifts were restored back to the
[49:08] church
[49:11] the church was flying high
[49:15] thank god the church was flying in the
[49:17] supernatural
[49:19] but who that are flying in airplanes
[49:23] want to go back to horse and boogie
[49:28] praise god we have uh come to greater
[49:30] achievements
[49:33] who in the automobile want to go back to
[49:36] horace and boogie
[49:40] brother and sister i had my opportunity
[49:44] some years ago
[49:45] when i was a young man i had a
[49:50] stick i think
[49:53] we drove 24 or
[49:56] 32 hours or something like that straight
[50:00] three of us taking turns driving
[50:04] and we drove straight
[50:09] to phoenix uh tucson arizona
[50:14] after i got out there the second time
[50:18] driving cross country
[50:22] that texas got us the next time
[50:25] i said when we get out of texas
[50:30] i never flew on a plane i'mma try
[50:35] i said i'm gonna try i gotta get enough
[50:37] grace and
[50:38] enough faith to get on one of those
[50:40] planes
[50:42] but when i got on the plane i said i
[50:45] never drive that floor again
[50:48] are you with me because it was so much
[50:52] better flying in that airplane
[50:58] so brother and sister we got there so
[51:00] much faster
[51:03] and we were so much we were comfortable
[51:06] are you look man just sitting back and
[51:09] let the pilot take us there
[51:11] are you with me so brother and sister if
[51:15] you're ever
[51:15] amen get on the airplane
[51:19] automobiles nice well when you get on
[51:23] the airplane
[51:25] but that's what the church
[51:28] and once it's gone through the baptism
[51:31] of the holy ghost and the restoration of
[51:33] the gift
[51:33] flying in the supernatural
[51:37] and somebody wants you to go back to
[51:39] horse and buggy
[51:40] somebody wants you to just to go to the
[51:43] justification and that's all they want
[51:48] come on somebody we go up to
[51:51] pennsylvania and see them still
[51:54] with their horse and buggy
[51:59] and they're still applying the mule
[52:04] but it's good to get on one of those
[52:05] nice act conditioned tractors
[52:12] are you with me and plow the field
[52:17] so by the grace of god some folk want to
[52:20] live
[52:20] in the past
[52:24] but there are others that are
[52:25] understanding the countdown is
[52:27] on as the natural world is making
[52:32] progress then you and i in the spiritual
[52:35] world
[52:36] shall be making progress
[52:39] we should be getting closer and closer
[52:43] to our destination
[52:47] to where god want us to be
[52:50] he said be ye perfect as your father
[52:53] which is in heaven is perfect
[52:56] god is amen bringing the church back to
[53:00] the word
[53:02] the bible said in the beginning was the
[53:04] word the word was with god
[53:06] and the word was god and the word was
[53:08] made flesh
[53:10] and dwelt among us amen the
[53:14] bible said amen praise god that the
[53:17] wife and the husband of one this is a
[53:20] great mystery
[53:21] but i speak concerning christ in the
[53:23] church
[53:25] father make them one even as we are one
[53:28] and by one spirit are we baptized into
[53:31] one body

[53:39] the word
[53:42] brother the countdown is on praise god
[53:47] as the world is looking as in the days
[53:51] of noah
[53:52] the scientific world amen has told
[53:56] no no you must be
[53:59] a false prophet we've looked through
[54:02] our intelligence
[54:05] and our scientific world said that it
[54:08] that would it will never rain
[54:13] but we're being warned that if we don't

[54:28] they say they and there are others that
[54:30] are saying

[54:40] is getting ready we cannot leave
[54:43] our destiny in the hands of scientists
[54:48] we cannot trust in the scientific world
[54:51] we must trust in the living god
[54:54] oh god i'm dependent on you
[54:57] i know it meant the world he means going
[55:01] through his chaotic conditioning
[55:03] and the world don't want to turn back to

[55:07] earth that hearts have been turned back

[56:16] not only that he said as it was in the
[56:20] days of noah
