I'm one of them amen Genesis go to Genesis amen Genesis sure to thank God for all he has done amen amen Genesis um chapter 1 verse 26 amen Genesis 1 and verse 26 then we going to go to amen going to go to St Luke 24 and 49 amen amen Genesis 1 how many thank God for the infallible word amen amen so thank God for God's word amen Genesis 1:26 says and God said let us make man in our image that after our likeness and let them have dominion and Dominion means Authority your power and over over the fish of the sea over the foul of the air over the cattle and all the over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of man of God created he him and male and female created he them come on down verse 20 says and God blessed them how we bless of God how many got bless of godon amen and God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and sedo it and have and have dominion over the fish of of the sea over the foul the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen so St Luke 24:49 St Luke 24:49 it says Jesus says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen may God be with his word he may be seated tonight amen amen amen if I would take a little topic tonight amen amen I pray we blessed to him man the part his power gives us our Authority his power gives us our Authority man read one more scripture man some St Luke 9 St Luke chapter 9 so his power how many want how many want the power of the Holy Ghost amen so when when the power comes that gives you Authority amen but you have no power you have no Authority amen because it's not your power is the Holy Ghost is go is God's power in your life amen to give you authority over the devil in this last age amen um St Luke amen um um PSAL St Luke chapter 9 and verse one praise the Lord amen how many thinkk God they born again tonight amen am amen so glad I can say I'm one of them St Luke 9 and St Luke 9 verse one says then he called his 12 disciples together and he gave them power and authority over some devils see this people don't realize we restored back to our original position of being Sons and Daughters of God so the same the same power Adam got a True Believer got today man by being born again amen so say say say say gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases how many think God we everything is under our feet because we're filled with the Holy Ghost amen amen Also let's go read one more one more s 10 of St Luke 10 go one scripture over St Luke 10 St Luke 10 and verse think 19 amen praise the Lord he says now this now remember this Jesus Christ talking to disciples amen how many of you are Jesus Christ disciples I am man amen J it says 19 says behold I give you unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and all and over all the power of what the enemy and nothing shall be and nothing shall by any means hurt you amen so how many so we can see that God have gave the church the power amen so I can show you when God put the Power inside the church but no one can tell when God took the power out the church amen so that so we so that power is not coming that power is here right now amen so we don't so we don't need we don't need the power we need Faith or the Revelation to operate that power amen but once you have the power you have authority over the devil say I don't care what the devil do you have authority over him because our God G you the power over the devil and this they say devil you a liar I and over you amen by the power of the Holy Ghost amen amen glory so so we we should be we should be sad we should be not depressed we know we should know that God is on our side amen and if God be for you let the whole world be against you amen amen so so you realize you don't have no power you you you don't have no power you have authority by the power of being born again amen because realiz God let read one more script I think about how realize we thank God for Calvary thank God for remember it more than him him going to the cross and dying he came for a purpose amen the prophet God he came for three he Jesus Christ came for a three-fold purpose one of those perpect was he came to he wanted to reveal himself to his people God wanted God God wanted God want to know how you feel see God had attributes inside him say he want how many know he want to how many how many truly say they know that they know that God Is A Healer how many you to say you know you know that God is deliver amen how many you to say tonight I know that God is a savior amen so God had attributes inside him he wanted to express to his people but we had to do that he had to do it through through do a Plan of Redemption so one thing about God brother prop say God want to reveal himself to the people next thing he want to do he want secondly have the preeminence in the body of Believers that his bride that they might have that that he might live in his people come on now how how many of you are how many of you are a Tipple of the Holy Ghost amen so how many how many all that within God he poured into Christ now all that in Christ he is poured now into the bride so the same power that Christ got you got amen praise God Amen so how many how many how many we don't serve a weak God we serve a mighty God hey man I got to take my co I I'm feeling good I thank God so many times people realize that in his life say in his life you going to have trouble amen but be of good Che be of good cheer I overcome the world so so if you can if you dwell on what you are going through you can never see what God has put you here for man amen see God has put you here he has put you on this Earth to test you and try you to let the devil know I got people on this Earth that's going to keep my word amen I got people on this work that love me above everything amen job I said we love God above our job am above there's nothing that come a Believer love God above everything amen cuz once you're born again once you be that's why one thing I think I think about think about your pastor Pastor Simmons man and Pastor one thing he say it's you must be born again am amen if you ain't born again you ain't got no power amen if you ain't got no power you ain't got no Authority amen but if you are born again you got you have authority by God okay what when say when the devil say boo you have the authority to say boo back amen amen remember you don't run from the devil amen because the devil has already been conquered at calary at Calvary but Jesus Christ said it is finished GL to God Christ don't pay for everything what whatever you need God don't pay for amen he done paay for your joy he done pay for your peace he done pay for everything God he said it is finished amen and the devil can't do nothing about amen do the devil ain't got to pay he don't he don't have a key to his own house amen God got the key see when Jesus Christ was I said I CAU up both death hell and the grave amen and he had the key God now the keys are in God's hands amen but let me ask you this question what God needed keys for let me ask you when Jesus Christ R again says all power is given unto me amen but how many know Christ is not here in the flesh no more he don't need the power you need the power but that's but the power God say now you are Christ in Bride form so that's what say the works I do you shall do also because the world see you they're not seeing you they see in Christ amen because now you have become the living work you have become a word made flesh for your day man amen y talking to young man today man oh Jeff need a job know you don't know your job me the Holy Ghost amen a a good job ain't going to do you no good but say first seek you the kingdom of God and all isites did everything else a good job ain't going to change your ways amen amen a fine girl ain't going to change your ways a handsome young boy ain't going to change your ways but get the Holy Ghost it'll change your ways amen it'll make you a child of God Amen say you you don't need a new job you need the Holy Ghost amen I say come on to church brother man I know I got I got I I I I I know a man who can turn on lights amen so Jeff you already trying to say yeah I'm trying to say so what you looking for ain't going to change your life amen amen the only thing that can change you is God amen mama can't do it Daddy can't do it Pastor can't do it but once you meet God once you meet God for yourself you will never be the same again amen that's why you must be born again Amen Let read that I think it's St John um chapter 19:3 man I'm going try to show you something see he had a purpose before I go so first he want to reveal themselves to the people he he want to had a preeminence remember everybody everybody God I mean I mean God don't want to be this be he don't want to be be the god of your life he want to be a lord of your life amen Lord mean ownership so when God tell you to go you will go when God say don't go say I want you want to be a prisoner to God Amen so once you become a PR of God remember I don't care what come go the Holy Ghost will never leave you wrong amen amen amen so St John St John 19 and ver3 I think it is St John 19:30 so I'm not going to be long com to close so his power power gives us our Authority remember you ain't got no power it's the holy ghost power amen how say Lord sit down a power down on me amen come on that Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost once that power come brother Gordon it make you live right amen it'll make you talk right it'll make it dress right amen it'll make it go to the right place on that Holy Ghost once the Holy Ghost come and S now if it comes to roer and reer it come the roer and controller of your life amen GL God Amen now one time I used to go to club now now I don't go to club now and now I come to church amen why God is the ruler in my life amen cuz I've been born again amen but if you never be born again you really can't change but once you're born again you can change you can be transformed to the very image of almighty God Amen praise St John I can't get to it St John 19 I say verse 30 I think it is 19:30 man he Jesus on the cross he said give gim said Lord if this if it it be possible let this cup let this cup pass but not my will but thy will be done see Christ knew if I if I he remember Christ had to bring his own body subject to God's word amen never forget he was 100% man and 100% God Amen but he had to bring this body subject say I not my will but Christ's will be done but the Lord's will be done in my life how say Lord not my will amen I want God's will to be done my life amen come your life is really not your own amen the Bible say you're bought with a price and you're not your man so you want how want to give all your life all your time all your effort give all your strength to the Holy Ghost let God use you to his glory and to his praise amen it says and when Jesus therefore had received the vinar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen so the last words Christ said was it is finished so he L that word up in the Greek iten it is finish mean that means praise God says to bring to an end to finish or complete so why he say this because now what he what God had in his mind say when Adam fell when Adam he did remember Adam was God where on Earth he had full Dominion on what whatever whatever Adam said God backed up but when Adam fell he did for the love of his wife the abstract title deed went back into the hands of God but God don't need it his children need it amen his son and door needed on this Earth amen so say I got I got to find a way to get my power so my children can have authority on this Earth back somehow amen but brother say every man that was born in sin was born in sin they could not they could not redeem no other man amen but think I I think of about Christ came down amen only he could redeem amen so Christ came through K redeem amen and once he paid the price that he once he paid the price that no man could pay it was finished amen man the power all the power that was in all the power in God now now I'm going give it to my Believers amen but but I I I want to get this point I say to finish finish mean in the Greek man means often written in on Ancient receipts or debts with the meaning paid in full amen so somebody had to pay the pay the penalty of sin amen but that person had to be worthy and no man was worthy Revelation 5 says who is worthy to take the book The the book was a book of redemption the the Bible and that book had all all God's children names was in this book amen but no man was worthy to take the book only one man could take the book and that was Jesus Christ amen so so so remember Paul wasn't worthy no man was worthy to take the book because only one was worthy was the lamb himself amen so when Christ pH say now I paid the price I'm taking the book now I got the book in my hand but it was still a closed book people didn't know what this book was really about out so for seven Church ages God was trying to unveil himself his people to to open his word little by little remember Paul was a prophet Paul knew about the serpent seed Paul knew but it was not time for for God to release himself fully to a people who could take all God's power so he worked seven Church ages to trying to get the people ready to take all of God's power but before God can get the power back to his people people he had to restore the word back remember because why it still was a closed book but when when God sent brother BR when God sent a prophet in this age Amen to open the book and open all the seals open all the M now now there's no more a closed book is an open book amen and so now when a so when a mighty angel came what in 1963 the mighty angel came down with open book in his hand what did he come down for to give the P all his power back to it Believers amen so that's why that's why we have a man born in sin cuz say he can he can speak to the storm just like AB said go storm go say storm go back you now God gave his power back to his Believers amen because of all the word have been restored back amen so now I'm ask you this question what's in your wallet what you doing with this kind of power that you have if no time to be crying say I Ain't Got You ain't got nothing speak now now you got the power to speak the word ain't got no job speak a job ain't got no joy speak Joy whatever the devil you lie I'm taking it back amen cuz I got the authority by the power of the Holy Ghost amen now what you do with this power amen what's in your wallet amen I know what's in my wallet but what's in your wallet amen we know what God done with brother Brandon we know what God done with Paul we know what God done with Moses but what God do with you amen cuz that same God Paul that same God that same God is here right now doing the very same things he's still parting the Red Sea he's still paying down Jericho walls he's still making a way amen cuz he's still God Amen praise God Amen remember the power is not coming the power is him amen but you need Faith to operate remember faith is a revelation KN I am a son or daughter of God and the Bible says if this what power power he says whatever you bind on Earth amen whatever you bind on Earth I will bind in heaven man because right now you got the authority Man by being born again amen so you more than you more than a human being you a super natur human you're a supernatural creature in a body of time praise God Amen I want I want refresh that St you got the power inside you right now to recreate your own world and live in it you got the power okay well I tell Church man if if you if you got a son that's bound say de Li I take my son back amen remember faith is a revelation amen and say if you if you say that's what say if you the Bible say if you say unto this mountain you can't move no mountain but God inside you can move any mountain is there anything too hard for God praise God Amen read coming to the close amen so so so when once you have that Authority remember when Christ it was finished it was already finished he said he had paid for all say I think think about Bible says um he was wounded for our transgressions God knew you was going to make mistakes the B say he was bruised for are our iniquities God know you going to f iniquity is do know to do something and don't even and know to do something and don't do it a man but God I got your covered amen everything you have in his life a Christian has God got your covered amen that's why you must rest your case and the finished work of Calvary amen you're not perfect but he's perfect amen I say you're not perfect but he's perfect amen and the perfect one is inside you amen praise God Amen go to one more scripture man eesi Ephesians 1 show you something you just more than a human being you sit and realize that the power you Peter says we've been kept by the power of God so realize not your strength not your power is God not by power nor by might but my spirit say the Lord amen so that's I think about your pastor I think about Pastor Simmons my pastor brother Perry man all those been going for years man they what's keeping them is the power of the Holy Ghost amen and that power and that same power can have kept butra that same power can keep you amen cuz it's the same God Amen praise God Amen it's the same God Amen it's a different body but the same God they get the same result amen amen do you know you Overcomer do you know God chose you before the for the found word to be his bride do you know you kick the devil Out of Heaven amen you was with him then you was in God's mind before the you before the found you was in God's mind so when you kick when you kick Lucifer Heaven you so if you defeated them then you can defeat them right now different place but same results amen because the Holy Ghost can't lose amen praise God Amen go Ephesians Ephesians amen Ephesians so his power gives us our Authority amen so the Bible says by one Spirit we all baptized into not five bodies one body amen and that's the body of Christ amen but I ask a question who is the head of that body Christ himself okay Accord to Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 I'm get you get get to see a visual picture of who you really are that's what brother say when a when when a True Believer or a bride recognize who she is and what she stands for she be an invincible Army you know why because Christ would never be defeated man praise God Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 praise God I think it's first um praise the Lord amen how many let's go to verse um Ephesians 1: 18 Ephesians 1 1 and8 amen come one more quote come to close amen say the eyes are understanding be how many God your eyes have been lighten tonight amen that's that's what the say in even time there shall be light Amen in the midst of all this grow Darkness M of all this Tomo and Chaos God got a bride of people that's that's shining bright as bright can be amen you are the light of the world amen amen has been light that you might know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his Heritage is in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of whose power his power amen his power amen his power to us War who believe according to the working of his what weak power no Mighty power you don't serve a weak God you serve a mighty God and that Mighty God is worthy to be praised amen that's that's I find I find most high when I when I get my worst trial when I get my worst test know my greatest I start praising God amen amen say Lord you kind of worthy for me to put get me in this test yes CU say he will put no more on you than you can bear amen so God said God if you if we all no more clear if you bring me to it you can see he can see you through it amen because he know the B the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by what the Lord amen so once God order your steps amen and know that you are moved by by God led by God you know you cannot go wrong amen because you're led by the power of the Holy Ghost amen amen amen come on down sit down now what is the see the greatness of his power to us War who believe how many how many Believers not amen amen when you're a Believer and got the baptism of Holy Ghost amen there's no devil in this world can stop you amen this this what be fa to realize the Devil is a big Bluff he ain't got no power because that Calvary God took all his power away so what he do he Bluff you and think that what you he he you ain't got power and he got power and one devil you lie I What God Says I Am that what I am amen if God say I'm Overcomer I'm overcome am man if God say I'm Healed I care what the doctor say I am healed amen because he don't have no power the Great battle ever fought is in the mind you must say devil you li I don't care what you say what I see we don't walk by what we see we walk by Revelation
