listening in the book of songs eleven we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ as we were in ministering on a mint lately on the different topics Amen a little bit of change this morning and talking about the the foundation be destroyed if the foundation be destroyed I think the devil has worked his work on the foundations and I believe that we see the effect Amen of the enemy amen and how he's crept in said he'll creep in unaware that he is crept in unaware so this morning songs 11 the one in the Lord put I my trust how sad ye to my soul flee as a bird to your Mountain below the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrows upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do the Lord is in his holy temple the Lord throne is in heaven his eyes behold the eyelid try the children of men the Lord tries the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violin is so hated upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and a horrible TIPNIS this shall be the portion of their Cup for the righteous the Lord loveth the righteous his cabinets dude the whole they are right god bless the reading of his word you may be seated god is good amen so this morning as we talked about if Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do and songs eighty two and five it says they know not neither where they understand they walk in darkness and all the foundations of the earth are out of course all the foundation of the earth is out of course if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do I believe that we need strong and solid foundation I've seen structures down the foundation was off and the build of went full of the bill then when they lead the block of the building because the foundation was all it was not all able to hold the roof the building began to boom the walls began to begin to stretch out because the foundation was all course brother and sister we get ready to put the cops cone on the building and as we began to put the headstone and put the roof on which is perfect law then we began to put the count stone on the building and we'll find that the building cannot hold they meant in a clutch friend don't find out later that you are in a Clemson building talked about this foundation amen it's got to be solid it's got to be strong we talked about a suits superstructure building a strong foundation now I want to go to first Corinthians three very important that I take my time this morning I don't know whether or not I preach just talk to you a little bit a little bit now when we talk about foundation we're talking about the bottom support and it supports the wall it supports the building the superstructure and as we want to build a house and a temple for the law and then building a temple for the Lord then we've got to make sure that our foundation is solid amen usually we have architectural plans and it tells us how deep to build how wide the bill before we began to build and if the plans are correct then they make we can proceed if we've been checked out and expected I believe that the inspector comes and he inspects the foundation and I believe he looks at the architect plan and see whether or not the foundation is according to the plan I believe that the Oxitec plans is the Word of God but God's going to look at how we build his house and see whether now it's according to the architect plan and according to the world I believe there many folks that are building great structures outside superstructures looked at whole thousands and ten thousand to the temple of the Holy Ghost that's a difference God is gonna expect you and see when you bill according to the pattern Moses I want you to do it according to the pattern know according to the pattern brothers sister and we expect to survive the storm did not care to be build according to the directions the God had given because surely the rain was going to come the fog was going to come and the plans had to be right to survive no one coming stole what sanitize do this to that to survive this bar will try to survive in this world just to live a little longer suffer because we've not taken precautions I'm saying that young people seem to be because they're not taken precaution because they figure they'll survive and I want to say to you maybe that's your soul you're not taking precaution and concern about your soul my pregnant sister folks semen I'm not concerned about the old safety safety elders but I want you to know it's an individual journey now and I want you to be careful how you conduct your life because you might be a victim or destroy many souls so you must conduct your life in a way that you might win souls and not destroy he that winneth Souls is wise god bless you today 1st Corinthians 3 and 10 I'm talking about if the foundation be destroyed he said according to the grace of God which is given me as the wise masterbuilder I have what laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth you know somebody said I don't have to believe what Paul preached they don't believe that Paul they meant was given his instructions by God amen but Paul said though we but a Jew come from heaven preach any other gospel then that which we preached he said to let him be accursed as the wise masterbuilder Paul says I suffer not a woman to teach nor the ocean authority over the man but to be in silence with all subjection but people say I don't have to listen to Paul amen I can do what God told me to do I'm gonna do what God told me that's what this Paul I don't know where he got his revelation from but I want you to know and not the blueprints even in the Word of God God is giving us what he wants us the God line in which he wants us to go by if we want to go to heaven and God has prepared away and Jesus declared I am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the Father except me come follow me you gotta come for Jesus and the Bible says in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah Jesus has already made the way plane I'm sorry you already made it play well yes I want you to know you gotta be careful how you build their own let every man take Eve high Bill's their own for all the foundation can no man leave then that which is laid which is Jesus Christ I want you to know it's Jesus Christ hallelujah this is why - God says mom any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay and stubble every man work shall be made manifest it for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by are you up here I said by fire and the fire shall try every mine work all you want me but fire you're gonna try your work well then you might be boo and you might be brave like a fire gonna try your work imma tear that our God is a consuming fire you gonna try you one day Amen the way I'm going to judge you one day friend [Applause] Latinos you doe Argosy fool said what salt it is the fire gonna try then a man work abide he has which he has built thereupon he shall receive a reward are you up there do you want your reward brother sister God got a reward for you did a man work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire know ye not that ye are the temple of God I'm talking about building a solid foundation but if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do you'll do when to take prior out of the school if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do hallelujah when their laugh man would name what will the righteous to women with women what will the righteous do if the foundation of marriage be destroyed what will the righteous do I said what the righteous gonna do not the foundation what it's gone what the babe is going to do when they allow abortion what will the righteous do but this is the Word of God somebody somebody got to tell the truth somebody got to speak the words of the gospel of Jesus Christ we're eating the power of God unto salvation to everyone to believe guarding your love is correction one day guarded the journey the world in righteousness I suddenly charge the world in righteousness God in the righteous goal and the righteous God that's gonna charge every man and you get to just reward yes God will repeat oh yes if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do what do you do God loves the sinner but God hates to see are you up man God loves each and every one of us remember he hates every wicked way God don't want us to do evil and expect God to come Amanda I said what will reap what we sow promise sister we got to get right with God and the songwriter side to get right oh yes your body the Temple of the Holy Ghost and then the Spirit of God dwells in you that's what everybody claiming that God is in them they're claiming not but let's check your foundation even when God made the world by faith we believed that the world was framed by the Word of God and if the world had his foundation and it came by because of the Word of God all you would be he was in the world world was made by him God and he looked out and inside it was good don't even look at this one no he said it repeated God that he made me I wonder what God is doing now and they looked out a wicked world and look at the condition of mankind what'd he say he said in the days of no nation in the but why is it why is bad what kind of condition [Music] what kind of world are we living in well that is no structure I want to leave here for mother and I want to talk about he made up the foundation of the home they destroy even what can the righteous do they may otherwise masterbuilder I'm lead the foundation the home may be said hopefully love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for the home should consist of the mother and the father remember we have fallen victims he meant that we only help whoa what that was all a device of the enemy but take the man out of the house and the woman be left alone to rather children if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do our son brothers they make the children to be responsible for your seed because it's part of you they destroy what children do but it's it's or not that's us little signal the foundation we destroy its male and female are you up there for the purpose of reproduction reduce and bring forth women and women get a man a woman and a woman cannot reproduce he said wouldíve he said be fruitful and multiply are you whooping we're in a condition if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do the homes that's been failing in the home the foundation says they met for but wives the mothers to be teased they meant good people at home to read the children but if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do they know I believe personally they meant the word is right then we need to open where he said that if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do that women should be soldered to her must be sorted unto Christ are you for thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over you are you up there but we are taking and we destroy the foundation in the whole the foundation in marriage has been destroy the structure husband torn down it's been weakened I believe sometimes will mo concern about our welfare our future then our children but I thank God for the women and the sisters that will lead their careers to the side amen they were real their children are you up and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the law I believe your responsibility they made as a wife is the radio's children I believe it's very important that the foundation of a child they mend the knee or with the mother and that model instructs the child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and in the natural amen if the child does not know what and have a vision of what they want to do as it is in the military when you join the military you may not know what do you want to be a mechanic I wonder you want to be a drill sergeant computer what the army will give you tests and find out your ability I believe it's up to the model and the fact of father to determine the event to see what their child areas of weakness of the strength because they want the child to be successful so the parents will look into I've got to leave a good foundation so there's Todd wouldn't the baby mothers whoo read the Bible and telling them stories that when the baby comes forth they began to put them in an atmosphere where they can grow and when the child is big enough to say mommy I want to be a teacher mommy I want to be in our playing power my child began to say it may change but the mother has heard something to the child desire she needs from that time for to begin to quit that child with the thing that will cause them to be successful and if he can not master the skill then they need to find out where the structure I believe that will missing out because we are failing to leave us cold foundation while there's no vision the people perish wait about a child that wants to be a great singer but doesn't have the boys cannot hold it to the mother could get all kinds of teachers and all kind of scruffy but yet the child still feel I want you to know David that child needs to find the area in which they can be successfully but many times it doesn't matter if that Saul still thinks that I can see what everybody know you've got to get over to that child Unitas al what tell you it's difficult to do the job in school if the parents have not prepare their children for school and to find out that the teacher its failure faced with a responsibility to teach children that need parenting first so the teacher find themselves with the responsibility are trying to get the child to understand social skills they meant to understand responsibility and it's certain things that should have been lead down in the home my topics as I go down and laying the foundation I could stay all knocked off it for a little while but I believe I need to go on a little further we have schools that have failed because the children in school first second third grade the teachers sometimes miss and the parents at home miss so the children are trying to make it to school they cannot read don't know the timetables and they are in junior high school I won't didn't know that child's life has been damaged and when they try to be successful nine out of ten you're gonna find a child that's not able to cope with society and I believe when it comes down to the knocker so it is in the spiritual there are many instances where we find our social inadequate spiritually don't understand the spiritual things of God amen we're not able to comprehend the love of God we're not evil to understand the requirement of what God is required of us any more lies why because of the foundation it's something the final that a cow is in senior high school and still can't add in citrate how can that talk so far what children and what the family I want you to know somewhere along the line he meant will come amen into a society he meant that a nut folks past old through a mint but the child is not being helped I'm in the church will come to a place in the church that people are getting into the church friends of mine it's very easily saying that folks to get in to the wedding and Jesus looked around at those that were in the waiting fine worn in the wedding that didn't have a wedding garment any eczema the question how did you get in the wedding without a garment Oh somebody declared he must have come in through the wonder because I'm here to came by the door then he would have got his wedding gone and I'm saying to thee amen we have folks that got would come in by the water and that's what kind of garment he got on a meant that in coming in by the door that they would have been clothed and garner righteous but nice white garment which is the righteousness of God and I want you to know as I go back to song if the foundation they destroyed what can the righteous do revelation said that the white rules in the righteousness of the sink saying somebody order people fair they many Hornady that him and you ought to come in but a no what are you saying preacher he the knew no sin was made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God all you would be a man if you're not righteous then you've got to come by the blood and by the blood of Jesus that he makes us righteous in him what happens failure become to guard the right way the Bible says therefore let all the
