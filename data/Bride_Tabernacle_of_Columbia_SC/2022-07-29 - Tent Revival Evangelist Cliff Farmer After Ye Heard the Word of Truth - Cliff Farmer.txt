holds the key to what you need death and hell he will defeat there's a promise coming down your dusty road well they're crying turned to laughter when jesus began to speak he said that little girl's not dead she's just asleep then he spoke to the multitude he told them to go on hold close the door and leave death and me alone then when the voices spoke like thunder hero death asunder and he said little girl rise up and go on your way well there's a promise coming down your dusty road from his holy hands he'll invert you flow well he holds the kettle once you need death and hell he will defeat there's a promise coming down your dusty road well there was a little woman out praying by her gate she was praying for her lost son to be saved well they say she prayed all night till she stopped the prophet's flight cause her little boy was almost dead and gone [Music] then walking down her way came the prophet of my day she said parson i've been praying all night long she said i saw you in a vision and what you might not know you're my promise walking down this dusty road oh there's a promise coming down your dusty road from his holy hands healing virtue flows he holds the key to what you

you just gotta believe it you keep holding on [Music] you love him tonight i'm so happy to be here thank brother henry for inviting us to come it's been a few years in the making and so happy we could make it i feel uh pretty inadequate i got my elders over here brother henry been preaching longer than i've been alive brother bill yance and brother brooks and brother keith reed and i got brother john thornton over here and i said my goodness somebody else could have done this but i'm going to tell you i got joy in my heart [Music] god has done something for me and i just can't keep quiet i i just got to tell about it tonight and so if we could i want to just go to the book of ephesians chapter 1 and verse 13. brother simmons told me when he called me sir brother cliff i'm not telling you what to preach he said but we're not going to have a meeting to tell about how smart we are we're not going to have a meeting about building a kingdom for man but we're going to have a meeting about souls being saved about those that are oppressed being delivered and so tonight i just believe there's only one thing that we can talk about that brings deliverance we're going to talk about it tonight ephesians 1 13. it says in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise and you can be seated i want to take just a title tonight from the first line there after you heard the word of truth and i just want to preach to you tonight on the word of truth and let me just start off with the words of the prophet he said and who is the truth does anybody know tonight who is the truth he said jesus is the truth the truth of the gospel what gospel there is only one gospel and galatians one said though an angel preach any other gospel let him be accursed this is the gospel the gospel of your salvation not another and there is not another tonight we're just going to keep it simple and we're going to preach about the lovely powerful wonderful name of jesus [Music] i want to talk about jesus and his precious blood you say brother i came to hear some some deep doctrine i want to tell you all the doctrine in the book is about jesus christ i i want to read you something else the prophet of god said on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is sinking sand he said denominations will crumble and fall nations will pass away but he will remain forever pilate one time was asking the question he wanted to know where is truth at and pilate said where is truth and truth was standing in front of him i want to tell you tonight if you're looking for truth you've come to the right place truth stands in front of you we are not just another group we are not just another church on the block we are not just another gathering this is not a lodge but this is a called out group that has been called out of every age we have been called out of the last church age into the bride's age this is my age this is my time this is my revival you see you want to find truth find a church that preaches jesus the correct way because you find a church that preaches jesus only you made a human out of him and if you find a preacher a church that preaches him as a part of of three of a trinity you ain't gave him enough glory so you've got to preach jesus under the correct balance you want to know what's wrong with the churches you want to know what's wrong around the message of the hour i want to read something to you mark 5 25 says a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years people got issues people are here for deliverance anybody need deliverance tonight anybody need healing tonight you come to the right place but i want you to watch this this woman had an issue of blood for 12 years and verse 26 says and had suffered many things of many physicians i want you to understand something the problem now was not the issue of blood that was causing her to suffer the problem now was the physicians who should be healing her is now causing her problems and the reason that the church is anemic it's because we have refused to preach the full counsel of god let's just preach about jesus in a manger listen jesus in a manger ain't gonna save you it's gonna make you hang up christmas lights and worship what happened 2000 years ago but i'm talking about a jesus of today a fresh revival a fresh anointing a new anointing see i've been going to a lot of meetings but i ain't been seeing no jesus preached i've been i've been i'll be hearing a lot of doctrine but i don't see the soul saved [Applause] i hear about mission reports but i don't see changed lives we have worked the people into an emotional workup and we stand in the pulpit and say you're predestinated everybody's gonna make it listen if you don't come to an altar and die to yourself you are not gonna make it everybody ain't gonna make it but see the reason people suffer is because the physicians is not bringing healing we just invite the homosexual in and let him sing [Music] you know they got adultery in their life but they got a good voice so we just pull them on up there and let them sing [Music] and the children are sick [Music] he said brother i came tonight to hear something up here i want to tell you how far up here it goes it reaches to the highest mountain [Music] but brother cliff we came to this meeting to hear something deep and it flows to the lowest valley [Music] brother that's just simple we need something to give us power the blood gives me strength from day to today i want to hear about something eternal it'll never lose come on quit trying to preach it so deep that nobody knows what you're talking about it ain't no deeper than the blood i won't talk to you about jesus for a minute just talk to you about jesus for a minute how powerful was he come on somebody how powerful was he i'll tell you how powerful he was joshua one time was wanting to lead the children of israel over but he was not able to be a redeemer and when he came before the captain of the host the captain of the whole said you are not worthy take your shoes off moses had wanted to lead god's children over and he tried to do it in himself and when moses came before the pillar of fire god said moses you're standing on some hallowed ground you thought you was hallowed i'm going to show you what hallowed is take your shoes off because taken off the shoe signifies that you are not worthy to redeem one day ruth was in need of a redeemer and in that need of a redeemer tobe came along and he said i believe i can redeem you and bow i said but i got a question for you can you redeem all of it i will tell you something you might have backslidden family members listen you don't need a god of salvation that can only forgive certain sins what we've done around the message of the hour is rate sins we won't let the adulteress back in the church but we let the self-righteous gossiper be a deacon and the people are sick [Applause] he said i don't need somebody she said i don't need somebody that can just redeem me i got some family out there i need a token good enough that i can apply it over my children i need a token good enough that i can put it over all my family i got nephews and nieces living for the devil i need a token good enough to put it on them and tobe said i can't do it and boaz said tobe take your shoe off [Music] but one day there came another man and he came walking down to the river where john the baptist was and for the first time john was such a great man jesus said there wasn't another one like him but when john sold that redeemer he said behold the lamb of god whose shoes i am not worthy to loosen because the redeemer had stepped up to the place acts 2 36 he said let all the house of israel know assuredly that that same jesus whom ye have crucified he has made that same jesus who you crucified both lord and christ i want to tell you something they're crucifying him again today they are crucifying the message but i want you to understand the message of the hour is my headship [Music] [Applause] because the message is christ somebody told me she said quit trying to get people to the message i said what do you think it is it's not another denomination it is not another organization this is christ in word form he said you crucify him but he's still lord in christ he said now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and peter and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do you want to know why they ain't no altar calls we ain't preaching jesus like we ought to what if i offend someone you might get them saved [Applause] could you imagine jesus when he walked on the earth saying now i know i said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me but now listen let me explain that to you let me make it a little easier for you to swallow no god didn't make it easy to swallow he just laid it out there like it was and you can take it or you can leave it they began to preach he said look at this we're so afraid of offending somebody what did they do they said the one you crucified is lord look what you did and they said then what do we got to do now i want to tell you something we crucify him with our gossip we crucify him with our hatred toward one another come on don't act like you don't know what i'm talking about we all say we believe the same message and can't shake hands with one another can't put our arm around one another got a sorry attitude that i'm the only one gonna make it when did jesus die and leave you in control [Applause] see you gotta preach some stuff sometimes to get people's heart pricked can i get away with calling names can i get away with calling the name i'm not being mean when's the last time you've seen an altar call and deliverance service at joel osteen's church he ain't gonna preach nothing that pricks the heart and so now what i see is that style of ministry moving in amongst our ranks we don't want to make nobody mad because i might not get to preach the meeting next year i want to tell you something brother henry i didn't come to please you tonight i did not come to please any one of you i came to please my lord and savior [Applause] if this gets me kicked out so be it come on now we're talking about the apostles they said what we got to do he said i'll tell you what you need to do repent see we don't preach repentance around the message no more let's just preach so everybody's jumping up and down i'm the bride i'm the bride i don't think you are come walking in the church with your high heels and your makeup and your painted fingernails oh i'm the bride of jesus christ god don't care about my flesh oh yes he does [Applause] and listen we used to have to preach about the sisters wearing tight garments [Applause] but you know what's gross to me now now we gotta preach it to the boys [Applause] and they don't even realize those skinny jeans have a homosexual spirit on them [Applause] but people don't want to hear that preached anymore because it does not build churches it may not build churches but it is the foundation he said i'll tell you what you do you think you're saved you think you know the gospel you think you got it together but i want to tell you what you need to do repent see sometimes we get in trouble us preachers if we preach against things that's going on see we let's just stay away from things that offend people let me tell you something i'm gonna tell you what offends me is that our young men are watching pornography and ain't nobody gonna say nothing about it what offends me is we got young p i'm gonna step out of my bounds maybe but we got young people dating and we put them off in a car by themselves all hours of the night and don't nobody want to say nothing about it because they might get offended i want you to understand something i would rather offend your child than for that for you to have a baby born out of wedlock that you got to raise [Applause] [Music] he said let me tell you what you need to do you need to repent supposedly sisters in the message putting their bodies out there on tick-tock but don't nobody want to say nothing about it see i want i want to i want to take a scripture and i want to turn it around on you a little bit we always preach that if a man looks at a woman to lust after he committed adultery with with with so she's as guilty as he is sisters we're not trying to put you under a thumb of how you got a dress we're trying to save you from being held accountable as an adulteress it might sound like law to you but it is grace [Music] he said now if you'll repent of this junk and then go get baptized the right way the right way i had a guy ask me one time he was he was trinity and he said i think you're oneness and i said no i'm not he said so your trinity i said no i'm not he said i'm confused he said so how do you baptize i said according to matthew 28 19 and acts 2 38. he said how do you do both i said because the bible said to baptize in the name and that's what we're doing and the scripture also said that all that you do in word and deed be done in the name of jesus and baptism is a deed so therefore we do it in the name of jesus see here's the problem here's a problem we have these meetings is this okay i hope i hope it's all right we we have these meetings around the message and we're trying to get all these young people to the holy ghost that ain't never repented yet and you know why they ain't repented yet because they watched mom and daddy and ain't never seen you repent see we keep having to have youth services we're going to have a youth service in the morning thank god for it but i'm going to tell you what we need we need some parents at the altar tonight so that when the children get something tomorrow they got a clean home to go to but let me tell you why let me just tell you this because this is in the ranks of our ministries brother brooks isn't it the reason people don't preach against pornography the preachers are watching it too the reason we cannot bring freedom is because we are bound and the scripture said how can he be bring freedom that be bound let me just tell you this i don't want to go to no doctor that's covering up his arms because he got leprosy on him but he who would heal the sick must not be a leper ain't none of that in there see we want an effect you got to preach jesus verse 41 of the same chapter says then they that gladly received his word were baptized when they preached something that pricked their heart and the same day there were three thousand added unto them the same day they were added unto them three thousand souls why they just preached the living god brother john they preached about a real jesus and they had an experience with him they knew about him the reason we don't see these things preached we don't have the experiences like we used to i better leave that alone let me just go home i want to show you some one time there was a woman she was a part of the kingdom of god but she kept walking to the well at a different time of day than everybody else and you understand i began to think that there was a lot of pharisees around and nobody went out to the well at that hour to witness to her and so jesus is going walking to the well and now he says uh you know disciples why don't y'all go on into town i'm gonna tell you something sometimes at our church i don't know about y'all but at our church sometimes the greatest move of the holy ghost we have is after we dismiss service and the unbeliever leaves and the make-believer leaves and the one that was fixed in his car sitting on the pew leaves and the one that's been mad at the song leader leaves and pretty soon brother wesley all the barriers are gone [Music] so jesus said i just need y'all to go on into the city because if there's one thing jesus knew you can't heal the sick and you can't save the lost you cannot witness to the adulterer with a legalistic christian with you [Music] i might have to get my brother to start the car for me we'll just leave town tonight so jesus begins to talk to her now this ain't the first man that's ever talked to her and jesus said i want uh i want something to drink and she said well oh sir you ain't got nothing to draw with he was drawing her right then she done bit under that first pool and uh so he said uh where's your husband she said i don't have one he said well that's true you had five and you got one right now that ain't yours i want you to understand something she done had six messenger excuse me six men in her life but when the seventh man began to speak to her she said sir i perceive that thou art a prophet and the scripture said she ran into the city but i want you to notice something when a change comes brother brooks talked about a change when a change comes according to the scripture that was the last day that she ever walked to the well alone but when she came back to the well brother woosley she had the whole city with her i'll tell you what if we will get off of our self-righteous high horses and begin to witness to the lost and to the drunkard and the drug addict and the harlot we might see the city of columbia in revival long i've been i don't even i don't know what time i got up here we're just talking about jesus can i read something brother bradham said to you you know what i'm tired of i'm tired of being people being ashamed of who we are quit being ashamed of who you are what if we offend someone you got to say enough to prick their heart or there ain't going to be no change he said he was the fulfillment of the word all types was fulfilled in him he became jehovah of the new testament he was the old testament jehovah the word then which was in the pillar of fire was made manifest and dwelt among us jehovah of the old testament became jesus of the new testament god didn't go nowhere he just changed offices oh i want to tell you something i work in an office and it's all i can do to fulfill my one job but we had a god so great that he could fulfill three offices of father son and holy ghost he could fulfill the office of twelve of seven redemptive names of jehovah the old testament calls him jehovah the lord my shepherd and in the new testament john 10 11 he said i'm the good shepherd and the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep in the old testament he's called jehovah jireh our provider anybody need providing tonight i will tell you this world's in a mess and we need some providing we need some healing provided we need come on we we don't want to talk about finances but i'm going to tell you something i didn't come for your money but we all need some finances and see the reason the world's getting it and we ain't it's because we're afraid to talk about it but philippians 4 19 said but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches i had a brother calling me today and he was talking about something and i didn't know how tied in tonight brother bill but he said you know he said i heard about a brother that just built a church and he said man he said he put millions of dollars in it but bragged because they put 50 000 in foreign missions and i begin to think 50 000 is a lot of money to me but depending on your status there's people in this united states that could give a billion and wouldn't miss it i figured out the other day you know this this guy that's in the news elon musk i figured up his finances i told my guys at work i said let me let me tell you something this man could make 272 billion people or million people millionaires and still be a billionaire but i want to tell you some everything ellen musk owns god owns the ground under it he owns the cattle on a thousand hills and he owns the hills beneath the cattle and the scripture didn't say he'll supply your needs according to your riches he's not going to supply brother john according to donald trump's riches but he's going to supply your need according to his riches where in christ jesus the old testament called him jehovah raphae the lord that healeth thee in matthew 9 35 said and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people what are we going to do about covert preach jesus [Applause] what are we going to do about monkey pox preached jesus come on i'm going to tell you we're so worried we wear a mask to church because we're so afraid of the guy next to us and sometimes i see people in such spiritual condition such spiritual sickness i want to put a mask on we're so worried about the devil giving us covenant taking this body and we've been letting him eat away at family altar our children know about the third pull but don't know how what a prayer clause it is our children can preach to us the opening of the seventh seal but don't know what the holy ghost is yet [Applause] i better move on he'll heal the disease matthew 12 15 said but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from fence and the great multitude followed him and he healed them all i'm going to tell you something you want to get some healing tonight you want some deliverance tonight just start following him romans 5 17 the old testament called him jehovah sid canoe the lord our righteousness romans 5 17 said for if by one man's offense death reigned once much more they which receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ the old testament called him jehovah shalom the lord is our peace anybody in need of peace the nations are shaking russia's ready to bomb israel wants to bomb north korea wants to bomb the united states wants to bomb everybody's ready to kill somebody and we just need some peace and ephesians 2 14 said he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of the partition between us i'm going to tell you i've been around i've done some traveling and i'll tell you how i know jesus ain't been preached there's too many partition walls up within an hour drive of my house i've preached in a upc church i preached in a trinity pentecostal church i preach in a baptist church but the message churches don't want nothing to do with this because we don't have the right guys preach our meetings come on where's the holy ghost leadership brother brooks we don't ever know who's going to preach our meeting my pastor called me the other day he said hey i got a meeting invitation brother you can pull my you can't pull my coattail i took it off you can pull on my shirt if i get out of line my pastor called me said brother cliff i just got a meeting invitation in the mail tell me who's preaching it and i told him who was preaching it and i told him what order they would preach in because around the message we got preachers preaching what night based on their batting average we have turned the house of god into an entertainment center and if you're good with altar calls you can have saturday night but if you're the beginner of the clique we let you take wednesday night come on now and around this message we've got so stiff and so starchy we can't love one another we can't put our arms around one another because we disagree on doctrine what is wrong [Applause] see i brother brother yvonne i may be mistaken but i thought the message came to pull us out of denominational barrier but if you're preaching jesus he said the middle wall has been torn down if the middle wall is down let me tell you another change that's going to happen i might get kicked out for this one but galatians 3 27 said as many as you've been baptized into christ you've put on christ there is neither jew nor greek i'm gonna get in trouble there's neither jew or greek there's neither bond or free there's neither male or female for you're all one can i give can i can i be free so why does the white church only have white preachers preach the meetings [Applause] i won't tell you what god did for me when god saved my soul he saved me from being white [Music] when god saved my soul he made me and you the same [Applause] so tell me why we still got a racist devil around the message come on don't say it ain't there we know it's laying there we see it laying there but if we will preach christ that partition must come down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my last name is farmer but farmer carries things that i don't want when god saved me he saved me from being a farmer he saved me from being white he saved me from being human and now i'm a messiah and now when i hurt you hurt come on we got so messed up around this around this message if a brother don't agree with us and the air conditioner goes out of this house if he don't agree with us we won't help him at all i'm going to tell you the word of god came to tear down partitions and when you heard i should hurt i got to move on i got to move on jehovah shammai says the lord is present with us i don't need an old testament god i don't need a jesus of 2000 years ago and i don't need a god that only worked up until 1965. you see the problem is that daniel was a prophet but the problem was that there was a king that rose up that instead of worshiping the god of daniel he said we need to bow down to the prophet daniel and that same devil is around our ranks again saying you need to take the preachers out of the pulpit jehovah's the lord present not a god of yesterday i don't need a yesterday god i hear the rain thank the lord for the rain oh it might be raining out there but i don't know if it's out there like it is up here but it's raining in here too the lord present with us we had a sister in our church 16 years old the doctor said we got to go in have a full surgery and take all of your all of your organs out i'm just going to say it that way they said you've got tumors but i serve a bigger god than a god of of tumors and one sunday morning i was getting up ready for church and the lord just began to lay that little sister on my heart i began to pray for and i walked to the pulpit that morning and i said little sister i don't know what's going on with you i said but have you felt like your world is falling apart she said yeah i said did you feel like it today she said yes i did i said well god sent me here this morning to tell you he loves you so that sister came up for prayer and she says the doctor says i gotta have a total surgery take everything out i'll never be able to have children 16 years old so they scheduled the surgery we had prayer but the doctor said no it's still there we need to schedule the surgery so two weeks ago they went in for the surgery and the doctor cut her open and cut and showed her back up and she came out in the wedding room and she said listen i don't know what's going on but the tumors are not there the only thing that is there is scar tissue where the surgery has already been performed [Music] jehovah present with us [Applause] we had a man sitting back on the back corner of our church here just just uh about two years ago he's 92 years old he fell out in the middle of service people kind of got it kind of frankie our pastor said don't worry about it just keep on preaching you know 92 years old let him go home but that ain't what god wanted to do we had a i can't think of what you call a first responder that goes to our church and he went over and checked his pulse and he said he told our pastor he said brother david he's dead and brother david just said move i won't say sometimes you just got to show the unbelief out the way i'm talking about god present he walked down and he laid his hand on him and he said brother daryl in the name of jesus and he set up and he said what's going on hold up a minute i can kind of i can kind of feel the unbelief was he really dead i'm just going to say they ain't no other way to say it he lost control of his bladder he lost control of his bowels the man was dead but i serve a god that is present with us and john 1 14 said the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the old testament called him jehovah nisai our banner and a banner is an ensign or something that is lifted up and if you'll forgive me for just a few more moments i want to tell you i'm seeing a lot of banners lifted up around this message but i'm not seeing too many jesus banners up brother bill i'm seeing seventh underbanner [Music] return banner joseph banner can i get a little closer to home [Applause] vin dial banner [Music] see some of you aren't sure if you want to go here or not cloverdale bibleway banner there's one banner brother wesley the banner is christ so i want you to do me a favor if you've been lifting another banner i want you to raise your hand and i want you to grab a hold of your banner that's been up over your head and i don't care what preacher it was i don't care if it was under the name oh i better watch out i don't care listen we've been raising banners of preachers around this message my whole life we have raised the banners [Music] we've raised the banner of martin come on man my parents went to a church when they were when they when they were young with when i was um my mom was carrying me and the pastor committed adultery but he wanted to keep the church under his thumb so when he committed adultery he said i've been living in adultery for seven years but i want you know i remain the pastor of this church so my dad went to the pastor and he said no we're leaving and so they came out to the car and they got my mom she was nine months pregnant with me and they said sister you all better not leave the church god might do something to that baby well he did he called me to preach and he saved my soul and he set my foot up on a rock and he told me to declare the glad tidings of the name of jesus and he sent me tonight to tell you if you have been bound you can go free see what y'all don't know i got family sitting here tonight that just came out of the same organization and they're gonna try and put fear on them let me tell you something family y'all ain't the first ones that's ever been through this we've done been there we've done been told the lies but fear cannot hold me my brother sung the song fear has no rule any longer [Music] [Applause] i think it's time that we tear down every banner that has been lifted it is time that we quit making meetings to be good meetings because of who's preaching it you you let me tell you something i'm guilty i remember when i was a young person brother simmons i i was seeking the holy ghost and because people pump certain preachers you know well i remember one time i prayed i said oh god if you'll just let brother jewelforney come preach i know i'll get the holy ghost we we had some young people that went to a camp recently and when they came home you know i thought when they we sent them to camp they're supposed to get the holy ghost and come home and spread it but instead they came home and they said boy all of the other young people that are struggling we just need to get them to camp you know why that type of mentality is around the message because if we quit saying it the camps will shut down i'm sorry i can tell some of you didn't like that but i'm going to tell you something i'm not willing to spend 500 to send my children to a camp that makes them feel good for about 10 days but they got the same lust devils they listening to the same rap music but i'm going to tell you what'll happen in a meeting you want to see deliverance tonight you want to see healing tonight john 12 32 says but ah jesus talking if i be lifted up if we will quit lifting men and quit lifting organizations and quit lifting denominations but if i would be lifted up i will draw men unto me i want you to understand the reason i preach jesus i want the sinner to be drawn tonight i want the young man with lust to be drawn tonight i want the sister with depression to be drawn tonight and if i will lift him up he will draw all men unto him my question to you are you lifting him up you say brother cliff i really wanted to hear about the seventh seal tonight you did brother cliff i wanted to hear about the third pull tonight you did i i wanted to hear a rapturing message you did [Music] you see you understand just because the terminology may not sound like what we we always do hey i'm telling you i told my pastor yesterday i said i wish i could get out of preaching this meeting because i ain't no meeting preacher i don't have no hype to have nobody up with it i don't have no deep doctrine but i'll tell you what i do have i came to you tonight with power and with demonstration of the holy ghost i want to tell you something i don't care how deep you preach if it is not bringing glory to jesus go back to the abc's again what time i need to close brother acts 4 8 said then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them rulers of the people be it known unto you that by the name of jesus christ whom you crucified from the dead that whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand before you whole this is the stone which will said it not of you builders which has become the head of the coroner why is it important to preach jesus the next verse says because there is salvation neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved see now i know what some of y'all don't think well the cliff just ain't too smart you're right i'm a high school dropout verse 13 said when they saw the boldness of peter and john they perceived they were unlearned and ignorant it said but they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus oh i want to tell you i may not preach deep to your satisfaction i may not lift you up into the heavenlies tonight but when we leave here i want you to understand one thing that this preacher has been with jesus and paul said it this way brethren when i came to you i came not with excellency or speak or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you what let's have a minister's meeting and see who's who knows the most about the seventh seal i thought about just starting to travel to all these ministers meeting brother brooks and when it comes my turn just stand up and say i don't know nothing but jesus christ and him crucified i want to ask you this what has your arguing doctrine helped your kids what has arguing doctrine done for your young people in your church has arguing doctrine helped your marriage issues brother you said marriage issue see we got marriage issues around the church i want to tell you something i'm just going to leave this here i don't know why it just it just got spoke to me okay brother when you text another woman that's not your wife and it might not be inappropriate but you delete the text so your wife don't find it you are already in the adultery path am i crazy there was a sister in church the other day said brother cliff can i have your phone number and i said no you got my wives [Music] sorry am i too old school for you i don't know maybe maybe i was born in the wrong generation but i'm going to tell you something the devil is coming in and we're allowing it and we just ain't preaching against it but i have come tonight to tell you there is a deliverance i want to just say this to you a quote from brother william branham he said he speaking of jesus is the principle theme of the entire bible the whole bible is about one name see well you shouldn't have said brother branham's name i say billy graham's name nobody gets offended see you remember what i said earlier quit being ashamed of what you are go to a pentecostal church they're going to preach to you whether you ever been in there or not tongues is the initial evidence of the holy ghost go to a baptist church they're going to preach to you whether you've ever been in there or not that once saved always saved you got to quit being afraid of who you are he is the principal theme of the entire bible he said this he said if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse go back and read it again [Applause] brother bill i could have come tonight and i could have preached about joshua and the exodus and all the types but joshua just means jesus and i could have come to you tonight and i could have talked about ruth and boaz and the threshing floor and the barley and all the seasons and we could have went through the tights but boaz is jesus i could have come and preached to you about rahab the harlot and how that a token was given to her and she applied the token over her home but the token the scarlet cord was jesus you want to go further i could have come and preached to you about the fire on the altar of elijah but what you understand is when a word prophet is on the scene that is jesus i could have come and preached all seven church ages well what i did tonight was preach to you what all seven church age messengers made their sermons about every message paul preached was jesus christ him crucified and when our prophet preached he said my message has always been the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i preach what paul preached [Music] quit getting so deep that nobody knows what you're talking about [Music] we got we got a real young church the devil came through and just wrecked our church and split it but all them old people that wanted to wear their shorts and wanted to live any way they would just want to live sloppy and call it grace they all left and now we got a bunch of young people that want to serve god and i told my pastor this i said brother david i want i want you to know this is my heart now if i'm preaching redemption or if i'm preaching about finances or if i preach about the seventh seal or if i preach about predestination if i it does not matter what i preach brother bill if the five-year-old child on the chair don't get it i failed and i believe the reason we have to have so many youth meetings brother junior i'm not against them don't get me wrong but the reason we have to have them is because the preachers want to please the people like pilate did and if we just preach it simple they might not want to hear us no more i will tell you something i drove the other day i drove up into missouri i was preaching brothers you know how sometimes you preach one of the messages that just don't work right man i had my head low i said man that was awful but right at the end of service a real sweet quiet spirit moved in we got out of church and my wife told me she said did you hear that little baby crying i said no there was about a six-year-old girl that when that presence began to move through the room she began to cry and her mama thought something was wrong with her and she took her out of the church and she said honey what's wrong with you and she said i don't know all i know is i felt something and i couldn't stop crying brother brooks i told my wife i said if god sent me to missouri so one six-year-old girl could get an experience with the holy ghost it's worth every mile of the trip if you don't see him in every line of scripture just go back and read it again i'm nearing the end but i just went back through the scripture because i thought calling him jesus that just this ain't enough you know what i mean how many of you brothers love your wife sometimes you just gotta tell her my goodness you're gorgeous hey fold them angels wings up and lay them on the chair we all like compliments husbands how many of you would like for your wife to just tell you how handsome you are i think sometimes jesus would dislike for his wife to just talk about how wonderful he is can i begin to look through the scripture of everything that ties to my lovely lord jesus and i see that the scripture said he is my advocate and the scripture said he is the almighty the scripture said he's the alpha and the omega and he is the amen he is the atonement he's the author and perfecter of our faith he is the ancient of days the beginning and the end the bread of god the buckler the capstone the chief cornerstone the creator the counselor the deliverer the everlasting father the el-shaddai the elohim the first and the last the great shepherd the great high priest the head of the church the holy one of israel the hope of glory the holy one the horn of salvation the i am the image of god the king of israel the king of the jews the king of kings the king of the ages the lamb of god the light of the world the line of the tribe of judah oh come on somebody i'm talking about how he is worthy tonight [Music] the lord of glory the lord of lords the lord our righteousness the mediator of the new covenant the mighty god melchizedek the morning star the holiness the prince of peace the resurrection and the life the rock the root and the offspring of david the savior the son of god the son of man the son of david the mediator the stone the builders rejected the true light the true vine the truth the way the life i'm talking about my jesus and last but not least he's wonderful but i want to talk to you all of those things are wrapped up in that lovely name well brother cliff what would just speak in that name do you know see that name jesus had been spoken by an angel to mary but the name jesus had never been mentioned from mortal lips but one day mary got it on a heart to go down and see cousin elizabeth brothers would you all play i won't hear that saxophone if it's all right just play softly jesus you're the center of my joy

feelings but let me tell you if you got it you're going to feel it she said i ain't felt my revival in a while oh isn't it someone you want a fellowship brother greeley with somebody about your

said no she said what brother john she said what's the name of your revival and she said it's simply called jesus [Music] and elizabeth said how [Music] my dead revival just came back to life and the scripture said that the baby john was filled with the holy ghost in the mother's womb i want to say to you if you've got family that is not in revival it is time to speak jesus over them tonight if
