your bibles to the book of saint luke chapter four and i'd like to speak brother brooks uh what a wonderful delivery man i tell you i wish i could sing like that and i loved singing so much sometimes i tried but i know my family really loved me and they said daddy when you go there please don't sing so i accept that amen praise god but i love good singing and i'll tell you i said black people can certainly sing amen we ain't offended by that amen we just know who we are so instead luke chapter four i'm gonna read from verse 16. and what a message last night oh that brings down the power of god and tonight we'd like to speak on my change time for my change hallelujah we read from luke that we go to saint john chapter 4. so verse 16 says and he came to nazareth where he was brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue and the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written there was a word for a day so you found the word for that day i would to god we'll find the mind of god for today hallelujah and this the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal up the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives the recovering of the sight of the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day today is this scripture fulfilled in your years then we turn over to saint john chapter four hallelujah amen i love the scripture in verse 22 he said you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek it such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth may the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated hallelujah you know we said what kind of man is this we would like to talk about the lord jesus hallelujah you know the bible said that there was a stigma about his birth because you know they said he was virgin born but how could a woman have a child without knowing a man and so you see they they never believe it and that stigma was there that oh god that day when he come to the the synagogue hallelujah in the bible said that he took the scroll from the ends of the priests and he found the place where it was written of him and he began to read the scripture not the scripture for moses day not the scripture for elijah's day but he began to read the scripture for his day hallelujah amen oh the spirit of the lord is upon me and there was something about the way he read it amen that the words actually stepped came in from the page and step into a body amen god was not far from them remember that almighty god had condescended maybe that was right there in their midst amen they said never a man came and read the scripture amen like he read it you know what amen because he hears the word and then the word step from the page amen when isaiah prophesied he meant that word was there he meant for years and years and years and years remember that word was for a particular day and then when he come on the scene he mean he take the scripture and he made the word of god live and i'll tell you that's what we want to see today amen we don't want the word for yesterday we don't want the word for tomorrow remember there's a word of god aiming for this day i mean the day in which you live and we want to be the people amen that has the ability and the inspiration ain't meant to take the scripture and let the bible live amen against our day hallelujah amen let's not say it is written remember let us say the word has been made flesh again hallelujah it was laying there for years and for years uh amen but here is the day amen when you are on the scene and i tell you you are here for a purpose amen god for ordainer amen that you should live it this day amen this is the most deceitful day amen but god never let you live yesterday it brought you up in this day for a purpose hallelujah and the bible said that all eyes were fastened on him and he said this day is this scripture fulfilled in your very year hallelujah we'll run back to saint john hallelujah and the bible said that he when he went to the marriage of canaan hallelujah him and his mother was inverted and he went along and you know he carried 12 disciples with him it was a big crowd hallelujah and the bible said according to the custom you know the wedding they would have served amen the best one and then when all was drunk amen could not differentiate him and then they take the cheap wine amen and they gave it to the guests because by no they were drunk amen and you know they can't differentiate they mean how good the wine is amen but at this wedding amen the groom did the best that he could amen he served the best wine amen that he had amen but unfortunately him in the wine had run out oh hallelujah amen and everybody come and said amen the wine is gone out now brother brooks is going to be a shame if you've got a wedding and you can't provide for your guesser amen so mary said jesus they say the wine is run out amen i trust god this evening amen that the wine is not run out amen on you and i am because we want the stimulation of revelation of the word of god today we're going to pick the word from the scripture and we want to make that word liver in this day that we are living in hallelujah amen and jesus tell them how amen fill the water potter even and they fill them hallelujah and they begin to serve amen the governor amen he called the bright groomer and he said sir hallelujah you give us the amen the worst kind of wine and when we are drinker and we are sonny's father and we are drunker you left the best wine for the last amen i want to tell you amen that we've got a day hallelujah when there was a gloom and we've got a day when the word of god was not here any but thank god for today it's the greatest day that you've ever seen amen we are closer aiming to our redemption today than we were yesterday and we are closer aiming to our translation than we were yesterday but i'd like to tell you this evening uh aiming all life is in a conquest amen this is a doctor hey me between god and satan are you telling me somebody here let me let nobody tell you amy that because you're a christian everything's going to be all right no it's not going to be all right i mean the devil is going to do everything in his power ain't meant to defeat you he's going to bring sickness he's going to be in pain he's going to bring heartache he's going to be in trouble he's going to cause your children to walk from the word of god he's going to cause husbands to against wife amen worms are to be against husband oh god this is not a picnic amen this is a doctor are you there with me remember the god we serve i said the god we serve hallelujah this is the only race amen that you have a winner that you have a runner that you know the victor even before the race beginner are you there with me i'll tell you this evening you're not just in the winner's circle you are the winner amen jesus christ amen has made you the winner [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah amen the god who we serve oh hallelujah he's a problem solver is a burden bearer he's a family man are you there with me hallelujah is a word of truth are you there with me this is not the day amen for partial word but this is a day amen for all the words of the scripture hallelujah to come to fullness amen god has elected a people in this hour to let the word of god live hallelujah amen glory to god hallelujah i'd like to talk about the woman of samaria amen i'm getting down to it now here was this woman and i'd like to say that today many of us ministers here we wouldn't want her in our church she had been married five times she had a mortal problem hallelujah i want to see the ends of those who have never had a problem in all their lives amy you see she had a mortal problem she have had five husbands and the man that she lo now live with her is not her husband hallelujah even somebody said if jesus was really messiah it wouldn't be that well or hallelujah but until you come to seek and to save them that is lost i if you're not sick you don't need no physician amen this woman has a problem i mean i tell you here tonight you're not here because you're good you're not here because you're good looking you're not here because your family background you're not here because the color your skin you're not here because of what you believe you are here because jesus christ caused you to be here hallelujah glory to god amen and the bible said they were all hungry and the disciples had gone to the city to buy meat but jesus had need to go through samaria hallelujah amen where we meet this woman hallelujah and he said to the woman give me a drink now the hour that the woman was at the well was not the ordinary time but because of her living she had so many complexes in her life that she didn't go to the well the way the normal woman would have gone but she wait until the critics and the black barters amen had left the whale then she turned up at the well hallelujah and she meet this man jesus and jesus said give me a drink and she said you know we've got separation law because the whites and the blacks are amen don't always get together we just put up with one another remember we rather we stay by ourselves hallelujah and jesus said if you know who it is that acts of you you would have acts of me and i would give you water that you never come to draw the woman said you have no you have no bucket and the whale is deep oh glory to god and i tell you the world is certainly deep the sibling hallelujah i hope you've got something to draw because if you got a need you need a container if you're going to be filled you need something to put it in are you there with me glory jesus she said give me this water that i don't come to this well if i don't come to the well everything is all right i'll be satisfied hallelujah glory she telling my father's worship in the mountain and they say that jerusalem is a place where men are to worship you know what a time it was the samaritans had no dealing with god because the jews take him to themselves amen like it is today if you're not in this group of that group you can't serve god amen you're not in the message hallelujah you got to be with us sir you got to say what we say amen the women know the woman know nothing about that that means she was already an old castle amy but i'll tell you tonight if you're an old castle if they put you aside jesus amen is here tonight he's here to meet your knees and to set your captive free glory hallelujah jesus i go call your husband amen and come she said i've got no husband he said you've well said i've had no husband but you've had five husbands and the one you know ever is not yours i perceive that you are a prophet because the messiah signer i see on display here glory hallelujah they must talk about the place of worship and jesus said woman the whole world cometh and no is can i preach now you see we are message people hallelujah we believe in the coming of a seventh angel messenger and sometimes like the pentecostals amen they said well if you're baptized in jesus name if you speak in tongues or amen the initial evidence that everything is all right i mean they said if you believe in the seventh angel messenger amen then everything is all right amen but i'll tell you amen i've never seen a people thirsty like i see them now amen we stop believing that he's a healer we stop believing he's a savior we stop believing he's a problem solver we stop believing he's a burden bearer amen but i tell you jesus is all of that we have set up so many laws and doctrine that the power of god can no longer move people being sick for years and years and years and they can't get well young people are hanging around and they can't get safe because of the life that you're living amen we said hallelujah that in the church amen we take the gifts of god and we put them in the back room you can't speak in tongues amen come on somebody amen i've got a preacher in my home one time i came in and he preached the gospel and a brother began to to speak in tongues and he dropped the mic and he walked away amen i look at him i said you'll never be back are you there with me hallelujah because the gifts of the spirit is for the people of god is the hallelujah is to keep the church clean hallelujah amen glory if we are serving the same god where is prophecy where are the tongues where is the word of wisdom where's the word of knowledge hallelujah glory to god and we put it in the background amen and we live like devils are in the front room but i'll tell you anything what we need tonight is another redeeping of pentecostal when the fire of god and it was in the church what we need tonight is the power of god

live loose or we still want to walk loose hello somebody we still want the loss of the flesh we want the pride of the ayah but we want jesus uh amen i tell you you're a lawyer and what you have is a mental conception of what god is but we need to get back to the old fashioned holy ghost dying out of the things of the world and let god reign in this hour pastors don't want it it would show the life they're living the people don't want it he would expose their life but people of god if we're gonna move out of here or we better get right with god come and do it now oh hallelujah jesus my lord

saved anymore only we just press the light and move from one place to the other place hallelujah it's the sheeps that are leading hallelujah let me not say the sheep it's the goats that are leading hallelujah and the pastors have compromised on the word even in order to keep the people because if you preach sinner hallelujah if you preach hell hot and even higher they're gonna go to the other brother church and you watch the people today they're going to the place where the fire of god is not are you telling me hallelujah holly you better pray for me because i'm going to preach whether you

it does this ministry is against that minister because backsliders has left the church and gone over there hallelujah amen and the brother then called back and said brother simon sir hallelujah what is this hallelujah but we cut the brother off because of you backsliding people are you there with me and the tension begin to build up in the ministry that there's no more love hallelujah when there's no more love there's no more power because fear has taken over the ministry are you telling me but god said i'm gonna shake oh hallelujah glory to god may i say tonight if some people should find themselves aiming back and right standing with god i mean they would have to leave where they are and go back where they come from and gonna make things right hallelujah and when we've got that kind of spirit nobody got saved people go with sickness and they're not here hallelujah because things are not right here comes are coming into the camp and they're not doing like joshua to draw the sword they are compromising and when they ask a question is it because of the offering or the times that they're bringing but i want to tell you tonight i don't care how much you heard now god don't need your money to establish his kingdom no sir what god wants he's a man or a woman that is surrendered to almighty god and die out of the things of the world that are willing to live clean before god then can god move hallelujah glory oh it's time we have a good old-fashioned house cleaning a good old-fashioned home's cleaning it's time we call back for headship of the holy ghost it's the time we swallow our pride oh glory but the bible said i've not given you a spirit of fear here's a right as a pastor you've got to be bold i'm not afraid of your faces hallelujah amen a man of god has got a plan listen if you leave me for one sheep i have i'm willing to go back to labor but i'm going to live above reproach for the sake of the word of god we've got too many lazy people aiming around the camp a little glory that are not willing to stand up on the word of god amen but god said the time is now for your change oh hallelujah i want you to tell your neighbor now the time for my change is now the time for my change is now i'm going to get back on the leadership of the holy spirit i'm going to get back to the power of god hallelujah i'm gonna say to my neighbor you can do what you want

people hate change people fight against change people resist change they want everything to continue as they are but i'm gonna tell you this if we keep doing the same thing that we did yesterday the way we do it we're gonna be here for a long time what is holding back the rapture is the readiness of the bride are you ready are you ready hallelujah we need to call a repentance and to do the first work over here's around we need to start doing what the bible said whether it's my child or your child and we have gotten into a stage of compromising the word of god we are afraid to preach against homosexuality because your children has been taken over by the spirit but we need to get to the stage whether it's my child or your child we're wrong the word of god is right your children are walking away but you don't want nobody say nothing about your children if the pastor preached against it hallelujah you're gonna leave the church but i'll tell you when lucifer left heaven heaven never diminished its glory when you leave the church because of unbelief heaven don't lose a member no sir hallelujah but god has a plan and a purpose for your life are you telling me god is your healer god promises that he's gonna heal you hallelujah i remember being over there in for portal uganda and then brother said well we don't know about divine healing hallelujah remember i'll tell you what amen i just had him in the power of god moved back home he's a rock here with somebody with a heart condition that the doctor said we've got to operate now but under the inspiration of the holy ghost i

now you see we talk about the acts of the prophet and we put it over to 1965 and it's finished there but i'll tell you william branham was not the object of what god was doing all that god did back then was for you as a matter of fact may i say to you jesus never had to go to jordan and was baptized but he was showing you what you need to do hallelujah is that too much for you you can't believe he never had to go up to about transfiguration but he's showing you and i am that we've got to climb up in our summit amen to believe god above everything i mean are you the people tonight that we said i believe god's word amen i don't want the mechanics i want the dynamics i want the power of the holy ghost let me to be demonstration in my life we talk about the holy ghost but we talk about a holy ghost that is dead that was alive yesterday but has no power today amen but i want a holy ghost today that's alive i want a holy ghost that will call out sin in the church i want the holy ghost

being so we don't have fathers and they will lead their children after them people say well you're in a certain class you can't make the rapture because of your yesterday because of what your mama did

said none that the father give to me shall be lost i want to tell you tonight you never went to calvary you never die you never shed your blood you don't have the nails god's hand holy you never had to stay there on that cross until every sin that was ever committed and it was paid for it wasn't you there that day any that cried out it is finished man's redemption has been paid for you don't know but jesus that paid the price when he was paying that price for sin he stayed there on calvary's crosser until every sin you ever committed everything you ever done for the farmer hallelujah opening his secretary he stayed there until he paid the price of your redemption any may i tell you tonight sin shall have no more dominion over you that's why we don't preach the blood they don't preach the blood because they say some can and some can't but the blood that jesus shed for me way back on calvary oh brother kid hallelujah romans 3 and verse 3 the bible said for all all the preachers too all all the self-righteous one all that sin and come short of the glory of god touch yourself tonight and say me to me too all that sin and come shout of the glory of god oh brother keith that is simple but if you're not sick you don't need no physician jesus said i come not to call the righteous but sinners unto repentance hallelujah but romans 5 and verse 8 but god we all sin and come short of the glory of god brother simmons i remember when i was a sinner i remember being on my first job sitting out on the bench when i took the break and a minister come sit by me and he began to witness to me about jesus and i remember i began to tell him on my fingers as smart the things that i'd commit the things that i was wrapped up in why i can't say yes to jesus and i could look at his face and he'd look at me and i saw the look when he meant to i had no hope is that right but i tell you that day brother had a night come to jamaica and he was preaching sin and i was sitting there and i'd say oh glory all the bloody words struck my heart hallelujah and i lift my hands and with tears in my eyes i saw that i was a sinner and i needed a savior amen i tell you i said many hallelujah cards of repentance even back there in the baptist church it couldn't help me but that day oh and sin becomes real to me amen i surrender my life to the lord jesus christ i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus even and he filled me with the holy ghost i'm never the same again but brother brooks there were times when i tried to remember what was it that i told that man that day and i can't remember the first thing you see jesus he took my sin i don't know about you tonight but jesus when he saved me it took my sin and he put them in the sea of forgetfulness i don't know somebody that knew me back then i remember but i thank god he don't remember and i don't remember all that i can remember his calvary calvary calvary and the shed blood of the lamb that was shed for me he will not tell you the bible said for the wages of sin brother keith you're going to make it that simple sure maybe tomorrow i preach on the opening of the word the seventh seal and the third pull but tonight i just want to preach repentance sometimes we've been in church for so long your backslid many years and you're still there hallelujah and you begin to tell yourself that everything is all right but deep down inside of you you know it's not all right because you're there in the church but you're backslidden and nobody knows about it but i tell you tonight jesus he knows about it you don't have to tell anybody to that but jesus knows he knows all about your troubles he knows that not when the tears were on your pillow amen because you're suffering in pain hallelujah sometimes it's not physical pain but
