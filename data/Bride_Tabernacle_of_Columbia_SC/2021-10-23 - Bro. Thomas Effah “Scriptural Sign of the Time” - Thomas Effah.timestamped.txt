[38:36] is it not amazing to worship your maker

[38:47] jesus is glad tonight
[38:51] jesus is rejoicing tonight
[38:54] because he can see
[38:56] the essence of calvary
[38:59] he can see these trophies
[39:02] and jesus is now rejoicing that cover
[39:05] indeed paid off
[39:08] because he has gotten us
[39:11] and we tell the lord that we have also
[39:13] recognized
[39:14] what he is required of us
[39:19] he desires your worship
[39:23] so if you have really
[39:26] recognized
[39:27] what
[39:28] god is
[39:30] demanding from us
[39:32] then we must call ourselves the most
[39:34] privileged people tonight
[39:36] to come into his presence and worship
[39:38] him
[39:40] let us pray
[39:44] precious lord we are thankful tonight
[39:48] that we can recognize
[39:50] [Music]
[39:52] the need to get into the presence of god
[39:56] no man could make it no man could come
[39:58] unto you except you draw him
[40:01] so if you have been drawn tonight into
[40:03] your presence it means
[40:05] is the grace of god that has really
[40:07] reached each one of us
[40:09] so father we are here to worship
[40:12] we are here to hear the voice of god
[40:14] we are here to receive
[40:17] so come among your people tonight
[40:20] and further bring the bread in your very
[40:22] special way that we can recognize you
[40:27] bless each one of us
[40:30] and let the holy spirit take over this
[40:32] service
[40:33] we are looking forward for your presence
[40:36] to be felt among us tonight
[40:38] in the name of jesus christ
[40:40] amen
[40:42] okay while i may be standing maybe you
[40:44] want to tell your bible with me let us
[40:48] read a scripture
[40:51] i take my reading from the book of
[40:53] matthew
[40:57] matthew chapter 12.
[41:03] matthew chapter 12 i'm reading from
[41:07] 38 verse to 42
[41:16] then certain of the scribes and of the
[41:19] pharisees and said say master
[41:22] we will see a sign from thee
[41:27] but he answered and said unto them an
[41:30] evil and adulterous generation secret
[41:33] after a son
[41:35] and there shall no sign be given to it
[41:38] but the sign of the prophet jonas
[41:41] for us jonas was three days and three
[41:44] nights in the whale's belly
[41:46] so shall the son of man be three days
[41:49] and three nights in the heart of the
[41:52] eighth
[41:54] the men of
[41:55] nineveh shall rise in judgment with
[41:58] degeneration and shall condemn it
[42:01] because they repented after the
[42:04] preaching of jonas and behold a greater
[42:07] than jonas is here
[42:11] the queen of the south shall rise up in
[42:13] the judgment
[42:15] with this generation
[42:17] and shall condemn it
[42:20] for she came from the utmost powers of
[42:23] the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon
[42:26] and behold a greater than solomon is
[42:29] here
[42:31] may the lord add blessing to read of his
[42:32] word you can have your sins
[42:38] i'm very grateful for this opportunity
[42:40] again to be with
[42:42] you i called bro
[42:46] simon but maybe a couple of weeks about
[42:48] two weeks ago
[42:49] and i
[42:51] let him know that i'm around the country
[42:54] so he just looked at his
[42:56] calendar and finally he's settled on
[42:59] this day for me to come over and then
[43:02] speak to the church
[43:04] so return the love for that hand of
[43:06] fellowship i believe most of you know me
[43:09] anytime around he opened the doors for
[43:12] me to come and then speak to this
[43:14] assembly and i'm very grateful for that
[43:17] hand of fellowship
[43:18] because a man cannot open his puppet for
[43:21] you just like that he has to have some
[43:23] confidence in you that you'll be a
[43:25] blessing to the church
[43:27] so i really appreciate
[43:28] god bless you my friend for
[43:31] this open
[43:32] door that you always grant unto your
[43:35] friend
[43:36] so we are really privileged people
[43:39] because
[43:40] god is in our midst
[43:43] you remember
[43:44] that when israel was journeyed through
[43:46] the promised land
[43:48] a bilam was hired to go and test them
[43:52] but one thing was really astounding when
[43:54] he got he got to do that job
[43:57] god said
[43:59] why not have blessed you cannot cast
[44:02] so when billam went into a higher
[44:05] mountain to see where you can see the
[44:07] whole congregation
[44:09] he could not cast he blessed
[44:12] and what happened he said balak i can
[44:15] hear the voice of the king
[44:17] among them
[44:19] so the voice of the king was among his
[44:21] people
[44:22] and today the voice of the king is among
[44:25] the bride
[44:26] the bride our movement that we are
[44:28] making to the promised land the voice of
[44:31] the king is among us
[44:34] and we cannot deny this voice because we
[44:38] are connected to this voice and this is
[44:40] the voice that is taking us through this
[44:43] journey
[44:44] the voice of the king
[44:47] so this message that we want to really
[44:49] look into tonight that's the scriptural
[44:52] science of the time
[44:54] scripture science
[44:57] of the time
[44:59] israel is mostly concerned about science
[45:02] and god also is very very concerned
[45:04] about science whatever god wants to do
[45:07] he will give a sign
[45:09] and when god gives a sign then he let it
[45:12] out for people that are predicted to see
[45:14] the sign of god in their age
[45:18] and when you see the sun the sun what
[45:20] does the sun does it cause attraction
[45:23] and sun causes attraction
[45:26] so when you see a sign it trusts you
[45:30] that is how god also do to attract his
[45:33] people so that they can recognize the
[45:35] message of their day
[45:40] no
[45:41] israel
[45:44] they are always concerned about science
[45:48] because that's how god presents himself
[45:50] to them
[45:51] so they come over to jesus christ and
[45:54] they ask him master
[45:57] all the prophets they come they give a
[45:59] sign the prophet is a sign
[46:02] so now
[46:03] you have come and a lot of people are
[46:06] really saying you are a messiah messiah
[46:08] but we are the phrases the jew we don't
[46:10] understand these things but here we come
[46:13] give us a sign so that we will know
[46:16] what you are talking about because we
[46:18] want to see a sign from you
[46:22] brethren
[46:23] they have refused their super son
[46:27] the bible said the lord will give you a
[46:30] super sign
[46:32] a virgin shall conceive
[46:35] something that has never happened since
[46:37] god created heaven and hell that a woman
[46:40] to receive seed by herself and bring
[46:43] forth her son
[46:47] that was the super sign
[46:49] that was what they're supposed to look
[46:51] at
[46:53] and god did not
[46:54] just do it in darkness
[46:57] he's poked about a prophet a virgin
[47:00] shall conceive
[47:02] and he shall give you a son
[47:04] and he
[47:06] be called emmanuel
[47:08] interpreted god with us
[47:10] god coming in humanity humanity god came
[47:14] to live among his people
[47:16] god came in that personality
[47:19] to reveal himself to his people
[47:22] as he did in the time of all to father
[47:24] abraham god has to do same to his people
[47:29] and that was the super sign
[47:34] but what did they do
[47:36] they refused to see their sign
[47:39] so jesus told them you are doctors
[47:42] generation you seek after a son the sign
[47:45] that god presented to you you refuse you
[47:48] reject it
[47:50] now you come to look for a son no sign
[47:52] will be given to you by that of jonas as
[47:55] you will refuse your sign
[47:57] this is the time
[47:58] the son of one will go into the earth
[48:01] three days three nights and he'll come
[48:03] out
[48:06] but i want to tell you that son of jonas
[48:08] it is very peculiar to you guys but let
[48:11] me tell you greater than jonas is here
[48:17] greater than
[48:18] jesus what was he trying to tell them he
[48:21] wanted them to know
[48:23] scripturally
[48:25] that god has visited his people
[48:31] brethren
[48:33] prophet said sometimes we don't know our
[48:35] authority we don't know what god has
[48:38] made us of
[48:39] brother you are powerful
[48:42] god has given you something sitting in
[48:44] you anyone that is baptized with the
[48:46] holy ghost brother you are capable to do
[48:49] all things
[48:50] with the holy ghost in you
[48:53] there is nothing that you have to fear
[48:55] that's what god said look he said
[48:58] when you see a man that is filled with
[49:01] the holy ghost brother
[49:03] that man he is typical to even or speak
[49:06] words into existence
[49:08] he is
[49:11] because you are don't pay with christ
[49:13] you have the same quality of jesus
[49:15] christ said you have become equal you
[49:18] are on equal times with jesus christ
[49:21] when you have the holy ghost
[49:28] no
[49:28] then
[49:30] that is why we can rejoice that we are
[49:33] john hare with christ
[49:37] you have that authority
[49:40] you say when you see a policeman on the
[49:42] road
[49:43] and then he lift his hand to stop that
[49:45] big car that truck that is pulling on
[49:48] the road it is not that he has got power
[49:52] but he has got authority
[49:55] he has authority the authority of the
[49:57] whole american state is behind that
[49:59] young man or the slave guy that's the
[50:01] slim man that is on the road you think
[50:04] you can cross him do it and see
[50:07] you can crush him
[50:10] the whole power the whole nation america
[50:13] is behind him
[50:16] and that is what we have to know that
[50:18] you as a son of god the holy ghost
[50:20] certainly you you have authority
[50:26] and when the enemy tries to pounce on
[50:28] you you have authority you have your
[50:32] authority to exercise that authority on
[50:34] the enemy
[50:36] all what you have to do you lift your
[50:38] hand and says hey mr satan stop right
[50:40] there
[50:42] stop ready because you speak with
[50:45] authority
[50:48] that is the son of god that is your
[50:50] position and that is what satan
[50:53] said satan is denying us he don't want
[50:55] us to recognize our place
[50:58] but when you are placed rightly when a
[51:01] son of god is possessing rightly brother
[51:03] you can do all things because you have
[51:06] got to estate a place where all things
[51:09] are possible
[51:17] scripture sign of the time
[51:20] now jesus went ahead and told him
[51:24] you
[51:25] the men of needy will rise
[51:28] and they'll condemn you all
[51:30] because they heard the message of jonah
[51:32] and they repented
[51:35] and the queen of shepherd will also rise
[51:36] in judgment and condemn you this
[51:38] generation because she came from at the
[51:40] most part of the earth
[51:43] when he heard of solomon
[51:45] and he came
[51:46] to identify herself with the gift of
[51:49] that day
[51:52] scripture sign
[51:54] of the time
[51:56] now
[51:57] when they come to jesus remember they
[51:59] ask jesus christ
[52:02] lord
[52:03] if you are the messiah
[52:05] then where is elijah because a liar is
[52:09] supposed to can become before you
[52:12] that is a scripture
[52:14] because there may be a letter to
[52:15] foreground the coming of the lord jesus
[52:17] christ
[52:19] so they have believed that jesus is
[52:21] christ
[52:22] and they are following him
[52:24] but
[52:25] one thing was missing they are not able
[52:28] to place the scripture they could not
[52:30] really identify or place john the
[52:33] baptist in his appropriate place
[52:35] they couldn't do it
[52:38] so that is why when you read john
[52:41] i mean matthew matthew 17 they asked
[52:43] jesus christ that question
[52:51] matthew 17 10
[52:52] and describes us him saying why then
[52:55] says the scribe that elias masters come
[53:00] they say elias must first come
[53:03] that is the scripture and jesus answered
[53:06] and said unto them elias truly shall
[53:08] first come and restore all things
[53:11] but i say unto you that elias has come
[53:14] already and they knew him not
[53:16] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[53:19] enlisted like was the also the son of
[53:22] man
[53:24] who suffered of them then the disciples
[53:26] understood that he speak unto them of
[53:29] john the practice
[53:32] which means they could not know they
[53:34] couldn't please join the baptist in the
[53:36] scripture
[53:38] brother the scriptural sign
[53:42] there was an attraction at jordan
[53:46] john the baptist did not go to his
[53:48] father's school he did not go to the
[53:50] denominational staff he didn't join
[53:52] himself with them because he has a
[53:54] special ministry
[53:57] it is not a denominational ministry that
[53:59] is what the bride god has pulled us from
[54:02] denominations he has pulled us from that
[54:04] is all this alternate stuff he has
[54:06] pulled us from pentacles
[54:10] we are above pentacles
[54:14] look at what pentacles they are doing
[54:15] they are messed up it is a doctrine they
[54:18] are rotten but the bride we have moved
[54:20] because the pill of fire has really
[54:22] caused another movement like i spoke to
[54:24] pastor
[54:27] remember
[54:28] john that that martin luther saw the
[54:30] light and he moved
[54:32] john wesley saw the light and he moved
[54:35] pentecostal saw the light and they
[54:36] available
[54:52] at the stuff what look look at what they
[54:53] are doing over there
[54:56] why
[54:57] because
[54:58] there is another movement and they are
[55:01] right in the clutches again they have
[55:03] come into the clutches of
[55:04] denominationalism but we are in the
[55:06] world because the word is christ
[55:13] scripture sign
[55:15] of the time
[55:18] when they went to john the baptist at
[55:19] jordan what happened
[55:21] this man was close with animal skin he
[55:24] was really not like the priest he was
[55:27] not like the cardinals he was not like
[55:29] the proof of the day he was just an
[55:31] ignorant somebody somebody with that
[55:34] good clothing somebody that was not
[55:36] eating good food
[55:38] you understand that was the sign to them
[55:41] where is this man stay staying in the
[55:44] wilderness why has he chosen to stay in
[55:46] the wilderness it was a scriptural sign
[55:52] but they could not see it
[55:55] when you read john chapter 1 verse 19
[55:58] they went to him are you christ
[56:00] say no are you elijah he said no
[56:04] are you the prophet that we have to look
[56:06] forward he said no
[56:09] then who are you
[56:12] amen
[56:15] brethren
[56:17] scripture son
[56:19] let us read it john chapter one quickly
[56:25] john john chapter 1
[56:28] verse 19 and this is the record of john
[56:31] when the jews sent priests and leavers
[56:33] from jerusalem to ask him who are they
[56:36] and he confess and deny lord but confess
[56:38] i am not the christ and they ask him
[56:41] what then are there elites
[56:44] he said i am not
[56:46] ada that prophet
[56:48] and he answered no
[56:50] they said they on him who are they
[56:53] that we may give an answer to them that
[56:56] sentence what's saying that of that self
[56:59] and he said i am the voice of one crying
[57:02] in the wilderness mistreat the way of
[57:05] the lord i said the prophet isaiah
[57:10] if you know the scripture if you want to
[57:13] see what god is doing in your day you
[57:15] must look into the scripture
[57:19] beloved
[57:21] that is why it is important for you to
[57:23] know your place it is not you a church
[57:25] member you are a way you have become the
[57:27] word of god you are the experienced
[57:29] image of christ today
[57:33] you must know your position
[57:35] if you open the scripture and you don't
[57:37] see your position in the scripture then
[57:39] something is missing
[57:42] you must say your name you must see your
[57:44] place that is why john when the book was
[57:47] opened and john saw his name the bible
[57:49] said he stopped weaving
[57:52] he stopped waving and say hallelujah he
[57:54] said oh the whole christian heard me say
[57:56] amen
[57:57] because he saw his name
[57:59] therefore if you see your name in the
[58:01] scripture you are identified with christ
[58:03] and you are part of the world and
[58:05] there's nothing that can stop you
[58:10] scratch your son
[58:12] so you you know that you are identified
[58:14] with christ you are not a church member
[58:16] you are not a member of any church you
[58:18] are a member of christ
[58:20] people prefer to take membership in
[58:22] churches brother if you come to each the
[58:25] prophets it is good to come to church
[58:27] but when you come to church move further
[58:29] and move into christ
[58:35] scripture son don't say
[58:38] brethren what is wrong with you you have
[58:40] come to the world that you have heard a
[58:41] voice a voice is crying in the
[58:43] wilderness and you are asking me who are
[58:45] you so what don't you know isaiah spoke
[58:48] of this
[58:51] you know as i spoke of this
[58:53] and you have heard of what's crying in
[58:55] the world that you cannot look into the
[58:57] scripture and appropriately put me right
[58:59] in the scripture if you can't see me
[59:03] are you blind
[59:08] if you care to know
[59:10] if you don't know how to play that i
[59:11] want to tell you go and read as i i am
[59:14] the voice of one crying in the
[59:16] wilderness i am
[59:20] brother
[59:21] and every sign there is a voice so the
[59:24] sign of john the baptist staying in the
[59:26] wilderness with animal skin eating all
[59:29] those stuff remember he was right in
[59:33] that wilderness to be assigned to the
[59:35] people
[59:38] but when they got there it is no more
[59:40] the sign look at the voice
[59:46] when you get into that environment the
[59:49] cell has caused the attraction all right
[59:51] but after the attraction what comes out
[59:55] it is the voice that comes
[59:57] hallelujah oh my oh man oh god i'm sorry
[1:00:01] i didn't i didn't see you i'm really
[1:00:03] oh
[1:00:04] god bless you my friend i didn't know my
[1:00:06] friend is here
[1:00:09] brethren
[1:00:11] so the voice is what is important
[1:00:15] so what did the voice say
[1:00:17] repent for the kingdom of god is at hand
[1:00:24] and those people that were predicted for
[1:00:26] the kingdom
[1:00:28] when they heard that voice
[1:00:30] they did not really stay with their
[1:00:31] attraction again the attraction has only
[1:00:34] got a pull on them it pulled them to the
[1:00:36] wilderness so the attraction has
[1:00:38] finished its purpose
[1:00:40] and the purpose and what is important
[1:00:42] for them is the voice
[1:00:43] and the voice is placing them in the
[1:00:45] scripture letting them know that the
[1:00:48] kingdom of god is saturn
[1:00:53] scripture sign
[1:00:55] of the time
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:58] so you see elijah
[1:01:00] why did john say i am not
[1:01:02] if you have not got a prophet to be
[1:01:05] honest with you if god has not sent a
[1:01:07] prophet you are being a mess
[1:01:10] let us be honest to ourselves
[1:01:15] god has to send a scripture a prophet
[1:01:18] so that he will do the blessing it is
[1:01:20] the way that pleases us and the word of
[1:01:23] god comes to the prophet and when the
[1:01:25] prophet gets the word and the people has
[1:01:27] messed up the word of god brings them
[1:01:29] back in the days of election he was
[1:01:31] assigned to the people
[1:01:34] and when they met up a ledger admin
[1:01:37] you read first king chapter 18 and let
[1:01:39] us say lord let it be known that i'm the
[1:01:41] prophet i am turning the house of people
[1:01:44] these people back to god
[1:01:49] that is exactly the ministry of elijah
[1:01:53] brethren
[1:01:55] and john
[1:01:57] he said i am not
[1:02:01] like there was a muslim preaching in my
[1:02:03] village he said you see your scripture
[1:02:06] your scripture is never correct yes this
[1:02:09] bible you guys are holding it is really
[1:02:12] full of contradictions
[1:02:15] how can elijah himself join the baptist
[1:02:18] say i am not elijah
[1:02:21] and jesus comes he said no no no no no
[1:02:23] no
[1:02:24] he is elijah
[1:02:28] so the muslim they took it and it was
[1:02:31] really a trump card for them and they
[1:02:33] said have you seen your scripture
[1:02:35] the man himself said i am not
[1:02:38] jesus comes he said he is
[1:02:40] who is telling the truth
[1:02:46] but thank god that god sent a prophet
[1:02:50] that is why we are above pentacles
[1:02:53] because blessed are your eyes that you
[1:02:56] can see these things and understand
[1:02:57] these things because the mystery of the
[1:03:00] kingdom is being let out to the bride to
[1:03:04] you
[1:03:07] but to them it is in parables
[1:03:10] it remains in parables because according
[1:03:13] to psalms he said i will open my mouth
[1:03:15] after 1978 there i will open my mouth
[1:03:18] and i will speak in parables
[1:03:22] and after he has spoken in parables then
[1:03:25] the disciples will go privately to him
[1:03:27] master
[1:03:28] those things you spoke please we didn't
[1:03:30] understand so we have come
[1:03:32] then jesus will tell them
[1:03:34] has all the people gone he said they
[1:03:36] have all gone has all the phrases
[1:03:38] everybody gone is the ira gun are you by
[1:03:40] yourself alone
[1:03:41] he said then sit down then you explain
[1:03:45] in detail plain language to them
[1:03:48] and you tell them to you it is given
[1:03:51] but to them it's not giving
[1:03:55] i was preaching in ghana i have some
[1:03:57] horns on my church and i always preach
[1:03:59] to the people in the community i say
[1:04:01] imagine
[1:04:02] look at when jesus christ spoke about
[1:04:04] the parable of the sower
[1:04:07] the one that sold his seed and then
[1:04:10] somebody comes out around by night and
[1:04:13] so bad wheeze among the seed you
[1:04:16] understand and then this man slept and
[1:04:20] then in the night this one sleek sneaky
[1:04:23] and then he sold tears among the witch
[1:04:28] and jesus christ said
[1:04:31] when the
[1:04:32] reapers are his servant
[1:04:34] so if they wanted to go and approach the
[1:04:37] whis
[1:04:38] but he said no no no you don't do it
[1:04:41] leave it let them grow together
[1:04:45] until you harvest time
[1:04:47] then i will charge the reapers first to
[1:04:49] get the tears the whis has to be
[1:04:52] to be them first
[1:04:54] and thereafter you get me the seed
[1:04:58] that is all what jesus said
[1:05:00] and all the people left and when we read
[1:05:02] the scripture after they have all gone
[1:05:04] so
[1:05:06] pastor if those people that are going
[1:05:08] what are they going with they are going
[1:05:09] with parable
[1:05:12] they are going with parable
[1:05:14] they don't understand when somebody meet
[1:05:16] them on the road what was the service
[1:05:18] what did the man preach this afternoon
[1:05:20] oh jesus you know this might always say
[1:05:23] story stories here
[1:05:25] you don't understand what he was talking
[1:05:26] he was just telling stories
[1:05:28] he said so somebody took a took seed he
[1:05:30] went and saw and all this kind of stuff
[1:05:32] and
[1:05:33] somebody
[1:05:34] so bad series
[1:05:36] that's all what he was talking about
[1:05:40] that is what they had
[1:05:42] and that is what they can report
[1:05:46] but the disciples stay with jesus and
[1:05:49] jesus told them the sower is the son of
[1:05:52] man the seed is the children of the
[1:05:56] kingdom of god and the tears are the
[1:05:59] wicked ones and the one that saw them is
[1:06:02] satan
[1:06:08] so friends if both people are going to
[1:06:10] preach
[1:06:11] the phrases that had a parable they will
[1:06:14] preach a parable they'll say oh we heard
[1:06:16] the stories and but when peter is going
[1:06:18] to preach he'll pray that the weed is
[1:06:21] the the sons of the wicked one
[1:06:25] because it has been interpreted to him
[1:06:29] scripture son of the time
[1:06:32] john the baptist
[1:06:34] was a scripture son and the reason he
[1:06:36] said i am not elijah the prophet made us
[1:06:38] to understand that because they asked
[1:06:40] him are you the elijah that is to come
[1:06:43] to restore all things
[1:06:46] are you the elijah that is coming
[1:06:48] malachi 4.
[1:06:51] he said no no no no don't put me in the
[1:06:53] wrong place you must not dislocate all
[1:06:56] this misplaced no put me at the
[1:06:58] appropriate i am not that one
[1:07:00] don't do that to me
[1:07:03] you understand
[1:07:04] that is why he rejected
[1:07:07] and he said no i am not because he
[1:07:10] cannot break the scripture
[1:07:12] a lecture another is doing five things
[1:07:14] five times it's coming five times
[1:07:19] elijah elisha john the baptist malacca
[1:07:23] for william branham and then
[1:07:25] revelation 11 moses and elijah
[1:07:30] so beloved
[1:07:31] that is why he rejected he said no no no
[1:07:34] i'm not
[1:07:36] because they were placing him in malachi
[1:07:38] 4.
[1:07:41] scripture sign
[1:07:43] and here jesus comes
[1:07:45] a virgin has conceived indeed and they
[1:07:48] have seen it but what was their problem
[1:07:50] the problem with the phrases is not that
[1:07:52] they don't believe that a virgin shall
[1:07:54] conceive they believe
[1:07:56] it is as
[1:07:58] it is as the voice of the prophet
[1:08:01] so they believe
[1:08:02] but the problem with them is that joseph
[1:08:05] was always moving with mary
[1:08:10] that was their problem
[1:08:12] and problem said if god wants to do
[1:08:14] anything he will create a room for
[1:08:17] people to criticize
[1:08:21] that's how god does his things
[1:08:23] if you are here to criticize this man
[1:08:25] you get many criticism
[1:08:28] if you are here to criticize this
[1:08:30] message you will get a lot to criticize
[1:08:32] if you are here to criticize the deacons
[1:08:34] you get a lot to criticize
[1:08:36] but if you're here to see jesus i bet
[1:08:39] you you see jesus
[1:08:41] it depends what you are here for
[1:08:47] you understand so
[1:08:50] jesus christ scripture has fulfilled
[1:08:54] that a veggies are conceived but because
[1:08:56] god wants to knock out the critics
[1:08:58] he allowed mary not to be by herself
[1:09:02] joseph has already engaged her
[1:09:04] so that the critics will disbelieve
[1:09:11] that's how god does his work
[1:09:14] that is why when we read john 8 41 they
[1:09:17] told jesus in his faith we are not born
[1:09:19] of fornication like you
[1:09:23] you are not born of any kind
[1:09:25] like you
[1:09:28] that is why they didn't believe
[1:09:31] not that they don't believe the
[1:09:32] scripture
[1:09:35] and that is how god also make it if you
[1:09:38] are not careful god will really
[1:09:40] something will happen and read the
[1:09:42] people that say we believe this message
[1:09:44] it will become it will get to a place if
[1:09:46] you are not careful
[1:09:48] we will also be in the same category
[1:09:56] no
[1:09:57] scripture sound of the time
[1:10:02] we know
[1:10:03] that
[1:10:04] in the days of noah he was assigned to
[1:10:06] the people
[1:10:07] but what happened to them they rejected
[1:10:10] the offer no one has really made a way
[1:10:13] of escape to the people and he has
[1:10:15] preached for several years calling them
[1:10:17] in but the people refused
[1:10:20] he was a sign
[1:10:22] and the act was a sign
[1:10:24] to them
[1:10:26] this is the act this is the deliverance
[1:10:28] this is your deliverance come into the
[1:10:31] act this is the only safety zone but the
[1:10:34] people refuse
[1:10:36] they refuse your son
[1:10:38] and whenever you refuse your son and the
[1:10:40] voice what comes after his judgment
[1:10:45] as judgment
[1:10:49] so israel they were much particular
[1:10:52] about science not to listen to
[1:10:54] intellectual speech that is what we are
[1:10:56] here for we don't want to hear
[1:10:57] intellectual speech we don't want to
[1:10:59] hear people that can really oh scream or
[1:11:02] maybe shout out to the most we want to
[1:11:04] hear the word of god we want to see the
[1:11:06] scripture sign we want to teach the
[1:11:09] vindication he said by my name he shall
[1:11:12] do these things we want to see
[1:11:14] practically god among his people
[1:11:21] brethren that's what we want to see and
[1:11:24] it is the prophet said the problem is
[1:11:27] not
[1:11:28] the word of god the problem is you and
[1:11:30] me we are the problem
[1:11:34] because god is wanting a place to live
[1:11:36] god is looking for somebody to be a tool
[1:11:39] in his hand
[1:11:40] and you have denying god that's right if
[1:11:43] you can avail yourself and give your
[1:11:45] life to jesus christ jesus here i am
[1:11:48] father use me
[1:11:50] let us see what god has gotten out of
[1:11:52] you let us see what will happen to your
[1:11:53] life
[1:11:54] if you can surrender
[1:11:58] like what pastor was talking why don't
[1:12:00] we see the power of god in the church
[1:12:02] again it is because we have relaxed
[1:12:06] we don't pray like we pray before we
[1:12:08] don't fast like the first people we have
[1:12:10] relaxed and we
[1:12:12] we have taken things for granted
[1:12:16] but it is time for us to visit the old
[1:12:19] days again because we want to see god in
[1:12:23] in his people
[1:12:28] you see down there
[1:12:29] god has announced you to prophesy in the
[1:12:31] church because you are lazy you don't
[1:12:34] prophesy again and then you are denying
[1:12:36] the church
[1:12:37] the benefit that you have to derive to
[1:12:39] get from your gift
[1:12:41] you are denying us
[1:12:45] you don't prophesy again you don't speak
[1:12:47] in tongues again and you come and sit in
[1:12:49] the church and say the church is not on
[1:12:51] fire they touch yourself on fire it is
[1:12:53] sacrificed because you have quenched the
[1:12:55] fire you you quench the fire
[1:13:01] may god have mercy on us scripture sign
[1:13:05] of this time
[1:13:06] they refuse to go in
[1:13:08] and now noah
[1:13:10] i mean jonas look at jonas
[1:13:14] the prophet said jonas was in in line of
[1:13:16] duty people said that he was running
[1:13:18] away to anyway no
[1:13:20] god was preparing a special that is
[1:13:23] offer for in any way
[1:13:29] believe it
[1:13:31] he has been sent to that is anyway then
[1:13:34] he when he went to the beach or he went
[1:13:36] to the seashore that the people were
[1:13:38] just calling taxes taxes taxes taxes
[1:13:43] that is what is happening today the
[1:13:45] people are looking for membership they
[1:13:47] are not looking for candidates of heaven
[1:13:49] they don't need they are not looking for
[1:13:51] people that can go to heaven people that
[1:13:54] we can relationship and address and then
[1:13:56] we dress them with the government of
[1:13:58] salvation
[1:14:00] they don't need those candidates they
[1:14:01] didn't know those people they are
[1:14:03] looking for members
[1:14:06] paints all over their faces come in
[1:14:09] pants oh come in
[1:14:11] oh stomach being open oh coming
[1:14:14] breast open oh coming
[1:14:17] come in
[1:14:20] like i was in south africa john is back
[1:14:22] this is the assembly of god church penn
[1:14:24] coaster church
[1:14:27] it was an eyesore it was horrible
[1:14:29] something that i saw in the church
[1:14:32] right in the morning they were shared
[1:14:34] they were they they were giving
[1:14:35] communion you know how they do it early
[1:14:38] in the morning they were giving
[1:14:39] communion
[1:14:41] and the communion bread
[1:14:44] for them to give it to a man or a dick
[1:14:46] in somebody that is really holy holy man
[1:14:48] to hold the bread no they call a
[1:14:51] beautiful sister to hold their bread
[1:14:57] and before you
[1:14:59] let me say it was horrible because this
[1:15:02] woman their breasts you know they did
[1:15:04] the the dress they saw and they they
[1:15:07] did
[1:15:08] intentionally cut their breasts here
[1:15:11] they cut it
[1:15:13] and that's what that that sister was
[1:15:15] wearing
[1:15:16] the breast was caught i'm sorry even no
[1:15:19] brazer nothing
[1:15:20] the whole black
[1:15:22] breast was exposed and he was holding
[1:15:24] the bread
[1:15:28] they are so rotted that they don't see
[1:15:30] anything wrong in sin
[1:15:34] because they have been swallowed in sin
[1:15:36] they don't see their eyes are blunt i
[1:15:38] said what is happening here are these
[1:15:40] people going to watch breasts or they
[1:15:42] are going to take bread
[1:15:49] breathing it was sad
[1:15:52] and my friend asked me can you join the
[1:15:54] lie and say no no
[1:15:57] not me
[1:15:58] not me
[1:16:03] look at moses
[1:16:06] moses
[1:16:08] was really comfortable for several years
[1:16:10] in in
[1:16:12] in pharaoh's palace but he recognized
[1:16:15] that he is not one of them
[1:16:18] so he has to associate himself with the
[1:16:20] slips because he identify himself with
[1:16:23] the sleeves he said i'm one of them he
[1:16:25] went to the camp we know the story how
[1:16:28] he killed an egyptian brother when you
[1:16:30] kill egyptian then he has to run away
[1:16:33] because he was wanted
[1:16:36] and god was also wanting him so moses
[1:16:38] was a wanted man wanted by god
[1:16:41] he was wanted in in egypt and he was
[1:16:44] wanted by god
[1:16:48] that's how sometimes god does it
[1:16:50] he'll place some problems on you and
[1:16:53] then
[1:16:54] you will run
[1:16:56] to meet and god will get you at a good
[1:16:58] environment to deal with you
[1:17:03] so moses sees the process running away
[1:17:05] and then he stayed first for 40 40 years
[1:17:09] in training then one day in the
[1:17:11] wilderness he saw a burning bush
[1:17:15] and when he saw this burning bush what
[1:17:17] happened he was attracted because it was
[1:17:20] a sign
[1:17:24] so when he came over to look at the sign
[1:17:27] then he moved further he said i want to
[1:17:30] make sure what is happening to this tree
[1:17:32] this lips
[1:17:34] then a voice book stand right there
[1:17:36] moses
[1:17:38] that voice called his name say wow
[1:17:41] stay right there
[1:17:43] remove your shoes where you are standing
[1:17:45] is the holy ground the prophet said not
[1:17:48] the ground was holy but the holy ghost
[1:17:49] was lost right there
[1:17:51] it was not the ground but the holy god
[1:17:53] has come underground
[1:17:58] that is why you are not holy but when
[1:18:00] the holy ghost comes upon your life
[1:18:02] you are a holy man because the holy god
[1:18:04] is certainly you
[1:18:10] brethren then when he saw the sun and he
[1:18:14] attracted him
[1:18:16] then a voice
[1:18:17] came out of the fire
[1:18:20] so now moses consent has now left the
[1:18:24] fire his concern is not concentrated on
[1:18:27] the voice
[1:18:32] and what did the voice say
[1:18:34] i am
[1:18:36] the god of abraham
[1:18:38] i am the god of isaac
[1:18:41] i am the god of jacob
[1:18:44] i made a promise to abraham
[1:18:48] and i have remembered my promise
[1:18:51] and i have come down to confirm my
[1:18:55] promise
[1:18:57] moses said wow
[1:18:58] this is a scriptural voice
[1:19:04] that is how we identify it
[1:19:08] when the voice doesn't pinpoint it
[1:19:09] doesn't point you back to the scripture
[1:19:11] leave it
[1:19:16] but he saw that it was a scripture voice
[1:19:19] he was attracted and the voice was a
[1:19:22] scriptural voice
[1:19:26] and moses
[1:19:28] he said what do you have in your hand
[1:19:30] he said i only have a stick
[1:19:33] god said it is
[1:19:34] enough brother whatever you have
[1:19:37] whatever you present to god is enough
[1:19:42] if you present your heart do not present
[1:19:44] your strength to god present your heart
[1:19:46] like brad brown said
[1:19:48] something presented his strength
[1:19:50] to god but his heart he gave it to the
[1:19:53] lord
[1:19:55] give god your heart
[1:19:59] so when you get moses
[1:20:02] what do you have a sense take gossip
[1:20:05] just drop it
[1:20:07] when you drop the stick it is it was no
[1:20:09] more music when you hold something and
[1:20:11] you drop it it is no more for you
[1:20:15] moses slap the stick out of his hand
[1:20:18] and he turned into snake
[1:20:21] and god said take it again when he took
[1:20:24] it it was god's road
[1:20:26] it was god's take no more was his take
[1:20:28] it has become a judgment stick
[1:20:31] the judgment ruled
[1:20:36] and then he said if they would not
[1:20:38] believe the first sign and the voice in
[1:20:40] this son it is a scriptural voice it's a
[1:20:43] miracle and if they will not believe it
[1:20:45] then put your hand in your bosom let
[1:20:48] proceed put it back healing he said
[1:20:51] if they will not believe the first son
[1:20:53] and the voice they will believe the
[1:20:55] second son and the voice if they will
[1:20:57] not believe the second son the boy then
[1:20:59] take water and then let the waters of
[1:21:01] egypt turn into blood
[1:21:05] judgment
[1:21:08] after you refuse the first sign the
[1:21:10] second sign and then you don't take the
[1:21:12] ten sun is judgment
[1:21:14] that's a blah blah blah souls that are
[1:21:16] in prison now
[1:21:22] hallelujah
[1:21:24] brethren
[1:21:27] judgment follows after you reject
[1:21:30] the voice of god
[1:21:33] the same thing is happening today
[1:21:36] people are refusing
[1:21:38] our sign
[1:21:40] now we must look at the scripture let us
[1:21:43] not really look at any church or any
[1:21:47] denomination let us look at the
[1:21:49] scripture and then let us identify the
[1:21:52] scripture of our day
[1:21:58] now we see god
[1:22:01] when jonah
[1:22:05] got to the beach and then he joined the
[1:22:07] ship of texas
[1:22:10] they got into the middle of the way
[1:22:12] they see trouble happen
[1:22:14] brother when you go and join the wrong
[1:22:16] church
[1:22:18] something will happen
[1:22:20] because you are in the wrong place
[1:22:24] and they will throw you overboard
[1:22:25] they'll throw you down they'll close
[1:22:27] like the one that was born blind
[1:22:30] he was in the wrong place
[1:22:33] when they threw him out because he was
[1:22:36] convinced that jesus christ is the
[1:22:38] messiah
[1:22:40] he said one thing i know if you say he's
[1:22:42] a sinner i don't care
[1:22:45] you can call him a sinner that's not my
[1:22:47] problem but one thing i know that
[1:22:50] i was planned
[1:22:52] but now i see
[1:22:56] that is all what i came to know
[1:23:00] so britain
[1:23:02] when they wanted to
[1:23:04] identify
[1:23:06] who are in this ship
[1:23:08] who are in this church
[1:23:10] then
[1:23:11] they started to look for people's
[1:23:12] identity
[1:23:15] then
[1:23:16] jonah was busy sleeping
[1:23:19] careless he didn't care what was
[1:23:20] happening
[1:23:22] that is most of us
[1:23:24] we are sleeping it is time to wake up
[1:23:26] because there is danger there is
[1:23:27] something on the sea there is something
[1:23:29] happening brother let us not sleep let
[1:23:32] us awake
[1:23:37] the big donor
[1:23:38] a slipper what
[1:23:39] you don't know what is happening
[1:23:42] he cleans so what is wrong
[1:23:44] so that sheep is sinking you don't see
[1:23:46] it he said i'm the problem
[1:23:50] look at my password i'm going to
[1:23:53] in any way
[1:23:54] this is my password this is my visa but
[1:23:56] why should we join this ship
[1:24:00] he said by when i got to the beach you
[1:24:02] were just calling tash's dashes why
[1:24:04] didn't you look at my passport
[1:24:07] president
[1:24:08] threw me into the sea and they were
[1:24:11] really trying to save this man's life he
[1:24:13] said you can't make it i know what i'm
[1:24:15] talking throw me into the sea
[1:24:18] he threw him
[1:24:19] and behold god has prepared a sheep
[1:24:22] he has prepared a fish like somebody
[1:24:24] told the prophet that there is no
[1:24:27] science has proved it wrong because the
[1:24:29] truth of the will a human being cannot
[1:24:32] go through
[1:24:34] problems my friend that was not the
[1:24:36] whale we are talking about god prepared
[1:24:38] a special fish
[1:24:42] he prepared a special fish
[1:24:44] he take he take this man of god to to to
[1:24:48] nineveh and then he vomit him he brings
[1:24:50] him out he bring the tongue and the
[1:24:52] people were celebrating they were so
[1:24:54] celebrated whole people maybe they were
[1:24:56] at home they saw a man walking on a
[1:24:58] tongue of a wheel comes out
[1:25:01] it was a sign
[1:25:05] that was the sign
[1:25:07] and when they got the sign
[1:25:10] what happened there was a voice
[1:25:14] jonah said repent or you perish
[1:25:18] and the people
[1:25:20] they listened to the voice of jonas
[1:25:23] because they saw that their god has
[1:25:25] presented them a message
[1:25:29] and that's how they all were in
[1:25:31] sacrament they believed and they mourned
[1:25:33] they wept for forgiveness
[1:25:36] jesus said greater than jonas is here
[1:25:40] they saw their son and many would
[1:25:42] believe when they saw the sign of their
[1:25:44] god presenting a man to them
[1:25:46] but israel god is presenting a man to
[1:25:49] you you cannot see it
[1:25:52] but a whale presenting a mountain anyway
[1:25:55] they saw it and they believe that this
[1:25:58] is the sign of our god
[1:26:04] beloved
[1:26:07] he said the the queen of sheba
[1:26:10] he would rise and condemn this
[1:26:12] generation
[1:26:14] because he had the fame of jo the
[1:26:17] solomon he had the good news that god
[1:26:20] has come to live in a human being
[1:26:24] israel that god has come down
[1:26:28] he always hear the news
[1:26:31] when
[1:26:32] the travelers all the businessmen will
[1:26:34] be coming from palestine he will he
[1:26:36] always hear those good news
[1:26:39] and he has been asking them
[1:26:42] what is happening in jerusalem
[1:26:45] it is fantastic wonderful
[1:26:48] their god has come down
[1:26:51] and there is nothing that
[1:26:53] you can keep it secret from that man
[1:26:56] he knows everything
[1:27:01] so this
[1:27:02] woman shepherd said no i can't stay
[1:27:06] something begin to burn in hey brother
[1:27:08] when you hear about god when you hear
[1:27:11] about jesus and you a product you are a
[1:27:13] candidate you are a son of god there is
[1:27:16] nothing that can stop you nobody can
[1:27:18] stop you
[1:27:19] you are hungry for god you want to get
[1:27:22] into god nothing can stop you
[1:27:30] they told the screen you can do it
[1:27:33] look at our gods we also have that gun
[1:27:35] we have all these gods around us where
[1:27:38] should you go and associate yourself
[1:27:40] with that kind of stuff we don't do that
[1:27:42] don't go and mingle yourself with israel
[1:27:45] don't do it
[1:27:47] we are also a denomination we also have
[1:27:49] our gods here
[1:27:51] he said what do you mean i've seen this
[1:27:53] god since my my my my i was born all
[1:27:55] these gods have been hung on the on the
[1:27:58] walls they are being hanged all over the
[1:28:00] world
[1:28:01] they can't speak they can't do anything
[1:28:03] and you want me to stay and then be
[1:28:05] watching this world i want to go and see
[1:28:07] a god that can speak
[1:28:12] so he get herself ready to go and he
[1:28:15] went
[1:28:16] and when he was presented to solomon
[1:28:19] nothing was hidden solomon told hey all
[1:28:22] about her you are a queen you came from
[1:28:25] sheba this and that
[1:28:30] but when the sign was affected on israel
[1:28:33] when jesus come and then he really told
[1:28:36] them their name he told them the son
[1:28:38] what did they say you are visible
[1:28:42] you are baseball
[1:28:46] then he said
[1:28:47] if you are calling me bezebed
[1:28:49] the queen of sheba will rise in judgment
[1:28:52] against you because she came from the
[1:28:55] atomos part of the earth and he saw the
[1:28:58] wisdom of solomon and he supported the
[1:29:01] work of god
[1:29:03] he gave her her presence
[1:29:06] when you see the movement of god
[1:29:07] supported
[1:29:11] support god's work
[1:29:13] and he said blessed are your people that
[1:29:14] stand up beside you and they see these
[1:29:17] things continually
[1:29:20] they see the signs while they are
[1:29:22] blessed
[1:29:24] and if you sit in this message and you
[1:29:26] see this thing continually and you don't
[1:29:28] know what you are blessed of you don't
[1:29:29] know what god has made you of
[1:29:32] you don't know that you are blessed
[1:29:33] to see this message to understand these
[1:29:36] mysteries
[1:29:38] make a half mess as we close brethren
[1:29:41] this end time god has revealed himself
[1:29:44] to us
[1:29:45] let us not kidding let us not do things
[1:29:48] to ourselves let us be honest this is a
[1:29:51] scriptural sign
[1:29:53] because when we also read malachi 4 you
[1:29:56] read malachi 4 he said at the end time
[1:29:59] paul will send as a prophet and you turn
[1:30:01] our hearts back to pentecostal faith
[1:30:05] the original faith
[1:30:06] he will turn the house back to the
[1:30:08] original faith
[1:30:11] and that is what brother abraham was
[1:30:13] announcing on him he came to do same he
[1:30:17] came to preach the message
[1:30:19] to turn our house back to the original
[1:30:22] to preach
[1:30:24] the message of the hour
[1:30:26] to unveil christ to us
[1:30:30] like i speak to pastor it was not about
[1:30:32] brother
[1:30:33] it's about christ
[1:30:38] it is not about you if i want to see
[1:30:40] christ i come to you and then i see
[1:30:43] christ in you it is not you again my
[1:30:45] purpose is to see christ
[1:30:50] and that is my purpose of coming to you
[1:30:52] brother i want to see jesus you say
[1:30:54] brother let me show you jesus your
[1:30:56] attitude your character how you talk to
[1:30:58] me i will say that is jesus
[1:31:04] so brother
[1:31:05] the prophet came to reveal jesus christ
[1:31:08] was
[1:31:10] for closing that is why he said you
[1:31:12] remember
[1:31:13] the same way that abraham
[1:31:17] your father saw a human being in flesh
[1:31:22] that was a sign
[1:31:24] the last sign before isaac
[1:31:27] came was god in flesh
[1:31:30] is that right
[1:31:32] that was the last time
[1:31:34] abraham saw god in the hearing he had
[1:31:37] saw him in a pill of fire but the last
[1:31:39] sign god became flesh and walked to
[1:31:41] abraham
[1:31:45] then isaac appeared
[1:31:48] and then he told them
[1:31:50] that as it was in the days of sodom when
[1:31:52] jesus came jesus told them your father
[1:31:55] abraham saw me when he was going to
[1:31:57] sodom you are not 50 years what are you
[1:31:58] talking about he said before abraham was
[1:32:01] i am
[1:32:04] god has appeared in flesh again
[1:32:07] he said if you are abram's seed you will
[1:32:09] recognize me because your father abram
[1:32:12] saw flesh and you wash my feet
[1:32:16] but you you see me you carry stone to
[1:32:18] cast on me you are here to kill me
[1:32:20] abraham did not do the things you are
[1:32:22] doing let me tell you to your face
[1:32:24] that is really the justice that measures
[1:32:27] it measures you guys that you are not
[1:32:29] sons of abraham
[1:32:32] he told them right to their face you are
[1:32:34] of your father the devil
[1:32:37] brethren
[1:32:38] and then luke 70 30 let us be honest
[1:32:41] with ourselves that as it was in the
[1:32:43] days of sodom we have sold them with us
[1:32:45] today and he said ask it to us in the
[1:32:47] days of sodom in the days of sodom what
[1:32:49] happened
[1:32:50] there was a scripture sign a man with
[1:32:53] two other that is uh personalities they
[1:32:56] walked to abraham in human flesh
[1:33:00] abraham was two at the angels the god
[1:33:03] with two advantages in human flesh
[1:33:06] problems said in the confirmation
[1:33:09] recommission he said god took the same
[1:33:11] dust that he molded up them he molded
[1:33:15] and three tabernacles he got into one
[1:33:18] the egg just got into the ida and he
[1:33:20] moved to abraham and abram saw god in
[1:33:23] flesh
[1:33:25] and jesus come again god influenced
[1:33:28] again make his deck
[1:33:30] hallelujah
[1:33:32] revealing himself in flesh
[1:33:34] and when jesus was influenced the people
[1:33:36] could not really identify him with the
[1:33:38] scripture he said this is your scripture
[1:33:41] son your father abram saw this same
[1:33:44] thing god in flesh he believed but you
[1:33:46] have seen me you want to kill me
[1:33:50] but he told them
[1:33:51] as it was in the days of sodom
[1:33:53] and sodom is a gentile that is country a
[1:33:56] gentile city and we are in sodom so god
[1:34:00] is dealing with the gentiles today
[1:34:01] before he deals with israel so sodom my
[1:34:04] brother america is sodom
[1:34:06] everything is
[1:34:08] is in a mess
[1:34:10] and that is why the whole west
[1:34:13] they have carried all the spirit
[1:34:14] american stuff has been carried to
[1:34:16] africa everywhere
[1:34:19] why because this is
[1:34:21] the president
[1:34:23] america is the present day amorites
[1:34:26] and when the top of the emirate is full
[1:34:30] we've got half menstrualness so brethren
[1:34:33] that is why we have to see the same
[1:34:37] manifestation of god brethren is not god
[1:34:40] problem is not christ but that
[1:34:42] tabernacle that body like you a pastor
[1:34:46] sitting here god is in him
[1:34:49] if christ is not him he has got no
[1:34:51] business yet if you don't have the holy
[1:34:53] ghost you can come here and pray the
[1:34:55] message
[1:34:57] it is the holy ghost that preached it is
[1:34:59] not human business it is not knowledge
[1:35:01] it is not intellectual it is the holy
[1:35:04] ghost
[1:35:07] beloved so the prophet william branham
[1:35:10] is not god but brother you cannot drive
[1:35:13] him you cannot expand him you cannot
[1:35:15] take him out of the scripture if you
[1:35:17] take abraham out to the future the
[1:35:19] scripture is not complete
[1:35:21] you can't do that
[1:35:23] he is a scriptural voice
[1:35:25] of our day
[1:35:27] malachi 4
[1:35:29] restoring us back to that pentecostal
[1:35:31] faith
[1:35:32] that's why he prayed the serpent he
[1:35:34] preached women cannot preach he preached
[1:35:36] god this one he preached baptism in
[1:35:38] jesus christ he preached woman is
[1:35:40] recovering he preached all those kind of
[1:35:42] message
[1:35:43] why
[1:35:45] he was bringing us back to the original
[1:35:48] faith
[1:35:50] we are privileged people
[1:35:52] scripture son of later
[1:35:54] we are
[1:35:55] brethren
[1:35:56] can you see yourself in the scripture
[1:35:58] can you see yourself in the mirror can
[1:36:00] you see yourself identify with the
[1:36:02] scripture of your day
[1:36:04] we are both pentagons we are private we
[1:36:07] are the super people on earth today with
[1:36:10] this message of the hour it has
[1:36:12] positioned us in a higher dimension
[1:36:16] that we are sons and daughters of god
[1:36:19] adopted sons and daughters of god
[1:36:22] do you love jesus present christ is
[1:36:25] sitting in you right there so you are an
[1:36:27] epistle problem said people would not
[1:36:29] read the bible again
[1:36:31] but they will read you
[1:36:35] they will read you
[1:36:36] if you are walking on the street
[1:36:39] he said
[1:36:41] perfect faith produce the goose but
[1:36:43] people will point their finger on you
[1:36:46] that is a christian that brother that's
[1:36:49] a christian go in there

[1:37:06] message i preached he said no

[1:45:07] to be like jesus amen
[1:45:11] the scripture sign of the time
[1:45:14] amen mary
[1:45:17] recognized that she was isaiah 7 14 a
[1:45:21] virgin shall conceive
[1:45:23] and she recognized that it was not just
[1:45:26] a virgin
[1:45:28] mary knew the name of the virgin because
[1:45:30] the angel had visited her
[1:45:32] and gave her amen
[1:45:34] a scripture sign of the time amen
[1:45:38] so she
[1:45:41] was the fulfillment of isaiah 7.
[1:45:44] amen 14.
[1:45:46] so by the grace of god we must know who
[1:45:48] we are scripturally
[1:45:50] that we are not presuming renting
[1:45:52] without authority just going through the
[1:45:54] motion just going to church and not know
[1:45:57] our day in our time and where we are
[1:46:00] praise god
[1:46:01] praise god many ministers they didn't
[1:46:03] know that john the baptist was divorcing
[1:46:05] one crime in the wilderness they didn't
[1:46:08] see him as isaiah 40 amen they didn't
[1:46:10] know that that what was happening when
[1:46:12] jesus came he opened the book and he
[1:46:15] read the spirit of the lord's upon me he
