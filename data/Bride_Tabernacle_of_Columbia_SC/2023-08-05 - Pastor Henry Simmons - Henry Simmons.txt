are glad for our visiting friends we do welcome you tonight in Jesus Christ's name Glad You Came trusted you'll be a blessing for you to be here amen amen be those that are listening to him we thank God for you listening in in Jesus Christ's name so Genesis I mean Exodus 3 and 14. I'm just gonna cut it short and just go straight to the verse and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me unto you may God bless the reason word you may be seated he said I am has sent me unto you he knew that the children of Israel would have a difficult time receiving Moses and the message that Moses had was one that one that the people were crying and pleading to God to deliver them because they had been in bondage for over 400 years in captivity and in bondage as slaves in the Egypt and they cried to the Lord and God raised up a Prophet by the name of Moses when he was born it was a decree to kill all the male children and I believe that the devil has a decree in this generation in this day yeah we find that the males are getting thin and the devil is trying to kill them off so by the grace of God and sometimes just wonder who can find a good man because there's not many to be found so the devil has a decree not to kill all the male children because they thought that if they're male children would be a threat until the Egyptian Empire so they wanted to kill him and as a Christian's if you see a Christian walking today the devil you are a threat to Satan Kingdom whether you're male or female you are a threat to the kingdom of darkness so God chose you to be lights in the world in the midst of a dog evil world the Bible tells us in Isaiah 60 gross Darkness should cover the Earth and we realize that gross Darkness has covered the Earth the Bible tells us in the last days prayerless times should come for men to be lovers of pleasure lovers of themselves more than lovers of God so we're living in a A Dangerous Time perilous time dangerous amen it's danger to just go out your house it's dangerous just to go to school dangers all around us so we are living in a time where amen the world has gone mad you don't know when the next mass murder you don't know what's going to happen from day to day so by the grace of God in the midst of uncertainty and insecurity we must find a safe place that we feel safe and secure and there's only one place that we can find that we can feel safe and we can feel secure it's only one place that I know of and that's in the Lord Jesus Christ without him somebody said I'll be like a ship without a sale I'll be drifting like a ship without a sale life has its many problems but to every problem there's an answer and Jesus is dead if we only allow him to have the preeminence in our lives so tonight I thought I just talk about I am I had prepared this to speak when I was in Florida a week before last and I went another Direction and I said I talked to the church maybe I am that I am see it's many times we know God that was and a lot of a lot of people have confidence in the God that was because they heard about what he was and who he was and they know about the God of the future that's supposed to be coming back to receive his people but the present tense that I am refined many don't know that God so he says the present tense God as I am that I am in Hebrews 13 8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever so we're not we're we have to bring God up out of history and bring him to present tense so he says he's the same God today and if he is the same God today then where is he where can I find that God I hope you know where to find him because if you look up in heaven and you think that he's there you look around and you said swear to God Jesus said let not your heart be troubled don't you be afraid let out your heart be trouble if you believe in God believe also in me amen for in my father's Kingdom if my father's house of many mansions if it were not so I would have told you he said I go away to prepare a place for you than where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know in the way you know Thomas said Lord we know not whether or not Gordon how can we know the way Jesus said I am there it is again I am what I am the way amen there's no other way outside of Jesus I don't care if they say this is the way that's the way but Jesus said I am the way because if you trust in anything other than Jesus Christ it won't help you the preacher is not the way the church is not the way but Jesus said I am the way the truth in the life no man can come to the father except he come by me if we want God then we got to come by Jesus he said I'm the door by me if any man enter he can go in and out and find pasture so if the way is Jesus Christ I am the way so if we were looking for him where can I find him today because people are looking for God but they don't know where to find him and many people go to church looking for God they're hoping to find God sometimes they get a pacify sometimes they're not they don't get the real thing they get a pacifier and sometimes it soothes them for a season in a while but they find out the pacifier would never uh quench The Thirst that the soul has so they began to search again and then somebody else gives them another pacifier and they was getting to suck on that pacified thinking that I have something that's real but they find that the hunger and thirst is still there so I'm still searching for that God that's real the God that I need I'm searching for him that's who I need I don't need a pacifier I need God let people come to the church sometimes they will come to listen to the music Sometimes they come to listen to sing and sometimes they listen for something just should make it through another day another week give me some words of encouragement just something to give me some consolation now I I I I I I really think I want God but I want some uh some confidence some assurance that you know that I'm all right that I can make in another week we need more than that after a while that get a little boring a little traditional we need more than just words of confident consolation a pat on the back I need God but sometimes he won't come until you really want him see because sometimes we don't we we want help from our distress and from our perplexities we want help to uh for our problems and and we want somebody to help us because we have needs we want our needs Supply but dude I want God because our needs become another need later the troubles that we have in life it's going to come you're going to go through trouble times you're going to go through difficult times it I mean it may the sun might shine but the rain comes sometime the storms of life come come amen and when you're faced with the do I have what it takes to make it through the storm am I able to hold up in the midst of difficult times do I have something where is this God that Mama talk about Grandmama talk about the preacher talk about where is this God I like to talk to him I like to know him I want this God I want to meet him where is he so Moses come down to each because they've been praying 400 years they they prayed and things was getting tough and it's getting dark outside how many of you believe it's getting dark outside in this world trouble praise God can the political Circle can they solve the problems can the church be the answer to our problems well this is what God did the Bible said the name is three and seven surely the Lord God would do nothing but he Reveals His secrets to his serving the prophet are you with me before God can do any major thing God always sends a prophet in the days of Noah God sent Noah a prophet to mourn the people and the Bible says in Luke as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom God shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed before Jesus came the first time he always sinned warning before judgment before he can introduce a major happening in the earth he sends John the Baptist a prophet he said repent and father what the Kingdom of Heaven is what he let you know what he was doing present tense amen not it was back in Isaiah said the voice of one crying in the wilderness said Isaiah the prophet but that voice was prophecy but when prophecy is being fulfilled it seems like it passed through and over the hands of people because when it becomes I am people say where is it amen so God is unrecognized so many times amen when he is he met people wondered who is this who is he because uh the god that I've been taught about and has been preached to me I thought I thought he was going to be a Pharisee and the sad you see that said I thought he was going to be a sign you see any herodian said uh oh a Samaritan oh what did you think so Jesus asked his disciples after he's been with them and they had experienced a supernatural said who the men say that I the son of man am who do you say who do you say I am see ya nah okay he was bringing you back tonight I am who do you say I am are you a man and Simon Peter has to say thou art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed that thou Simon vagina for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and he said Upon This Rock upon the revelation of who I am I'll build my church Upon This Rock I've been my church and the gates of Hell shall not Prevail against us once you get a revelation of where who God is then the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it the reason why people amen act the way they act and live the way they live because they don't know who he is but if you ever find him praise God I heard somebody said never heard a man speak like this man amen once you come to know Jesus praise God nothing else can satisfy you praise God I was telling some people that were drinking and drugging and I says praise God what's the problem is you never taste this wine praise God you can get drunk off that other one watch you taste this wine you don't want that one no more praise God you never even experienced this God but if you experience this God you'll find out nothing can come close can't nobody somebody said can't nobody Do Me Like Jesus amen praise God and I I believe amen it's the Revelation that you must understand amen that God reveals himself to whom he will he said no man has come unto uh the father and no man have come to me except the father drawing he said you've not chosen me but I've chosen you and I've ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain so God chooses us amen praise God so what oh Hallelujah it takes God to come down and reveal himself to you as an individual I am sent you yeah oh can't you imagine somebody coming and saying God sent me to you and God told me to tell you that you need to give your life to Jesus you're having trouble you're having problems you're having difficulties you're going through things but God told me to tell you God sent me to you and he said it wasn't important who I am I'm not important but I want you to know who sent me to tell you see sometimes people get mixed up it was the flesh that hid God that people didn't know who Jesus was the Bible said he was in the world the world was made by him but the world did not know who he was but the Bible said in the beginning what the word the word was with God and the Word was God but when the word was made flesh it dwells Among Us are you with me and when they saw the flesh they could not see God because the flesh covered God it looked like a man but God was in the man the witness God was in Christ to reconcile the world to himself even though God was in in a veil amen they couldn't see God because they recognized him as a man and they couldn't receive him because he was a man so he he had trouble so do we have trouble today we come amen with the word from the Lord to tell the people that Jesus loves them and Jesus died for their sin but they don't want the Jesus that died for their sin to deliver them out of their chaos and out of their trouble and out of the the things that their lives would have to go through amen without God on their side you come to him and you tell them that you need God and they said they're not looking at God what your message that you're giving them they're looking at the veil that's giving them the message oftentimes they're not looking at he said the watch that I do it's not me that's doing the work it's the father that was in me he's the one that's doing the word you really tell me about looking for God you tell me he's in Christ yes he is in Christ but that same God that was in Christ that people had trouble believing that he was Jesus said I am the light of the world isn't that right if you want to know who I am he said I am the light of the world but he said men love Darkness rather than life because they're what the Deeds are evil people can't seem to grasp God amen when God is speaking to him amen they're too busy looking at the Flesh of the man until they can't hear the message that God sent to them as individuals and God sent you messages as individuals I begin to speak to your heart I was telling somebody simplifying you know some of the things that they heard when the preacher was preaching on Sunday and I said I'm going to simplify it I said you know the voice that tells you all of your life don't do this and you do it anyway and it's a voice it says do it and you know it's wrong I see you how do you know when God's speaking to you I said to God when the God is speaking to you he tells you to do the right thing but when the devil is speaking to you he tells you to do the wrong thing I said it's just like the red light the red light says Scott and when the real lights just stop and you don't stop you know one day after a while the red light become the green light are you with me so they that Wicked one the evil one that you listen to instead of listening to the right one you listen to the evil one that told you to do the wrong thing then you believe that the evil one is the one that you ought to obey he becomes your master he becomes your God for he says of Our Gospel to hear this hit to them that are lost whom the God of this world has blinded the mind of them that believe not at least the light of the Glorious gospel who is the image of God to shine into them are you with me so once they began to look and run the light so much they began to get a strong delusion until they think that's right is wrong and wrong is right so you see how far people go they do things that and you can't tell him if you told them that this is wrong to do they say you don't have love because we ought to love Rome we love the individual but if we don't love the sin are you with me God have mercy on the individual but God has to call Sin Sin are you and because we love you we tell you the what tell you the truth but people don't want to it's not a thing that's wrong or right you just do what you feel in your heart to do is right Jeremiah's a heart is deceitful above all things and desperately a wicked who knows God are you with me praise God oh God I gotta close I don't want to be too long but I am that I am I am that I am where is it I'm looking for so when it came down I am come down to deliver them don't you know that I am came down to deliver them and they saw Moses are you with me and when they saw Moses they saw mine but I am they didn't know the god that sent Moses god in Moses are you with me that Jesus that said I go and prepare a place for you he said I won't leave your confidence but I'm gonna come again and I'm gonna receive you to myself he said I'm with you but I shall be in you and great is he that swear in you than he that's in the world isn't that right so the God Amen the Savior amen praise God when he comes into your life praise God he's there in the form of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost amen doing what to let you shine reflect his attributes until a Dying World so your life ought to be a real reflection of Jesus Christ in the Earth today how he lived how he walked how he talked then you become he became sin in second Corinthians 5 21 he became sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in him so what he does he takes on your sin and he gives you his righteousness amen but if you don't want somebody said he took away my old filthy garment and gave me a robe of your life are you with me so God takes away amen praise God all your sins and all you ever done and he laid it on Jesus on the cross somebody said at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away it was of our faith I received my and now I'm happy all today you're the reason why we have sad people because they have not come to see what Jesus did for them on the cross reason why we have trouble people because they go to church amen but they don't know the value of the cross they don't know what the blood of Jesus has done for them has washed away your sins he has forgiven you and he's given you eternal life if you want it have you received him praise God hallelujah it's yours amen you don't have to beg for it all you got to do is receive D amen he's already paid in the debt he already paid the price all you got to do is to receive Jesus Christ is that easy praise God we couldn't do nothing to get ourselves to save ourselves so God comes down to a people a people that's troubled people that it's no way they was going to get out of their troubles their chaos the chains and the whips and the beating that they were going through no way for them to get out but I am God that I am praise God in this dark generation in this dark day God does the same thing at evening time it shall be light God shines a light Jesus came at midnight of the Jewish dispensation and at midnight Jesus came at their midnight just before God turned the lights out on the Jews and move to the Gentiles the midnight Jesus came in the middle of the book and stepped down on the scene and said I'm the lights in such a dark time of religious confusion but I am the lion I believe we in amen a deeper Darkness of the Gentiles dispensation and God is getting ready to turn back to Israel are you with me and when flow God turns back to Israel God sends amen of Moses in our day and sent a prophet on the scene to tell us get back to God get back to the word amen and he leads us back to the book that's been sealed to the time of the end the book The Shield book you told Daniel set up the book to the time of the end he told uh uh John amen seal of the book he said I heard seven Thunders out of their voices and I was about to write and he said seal the book but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound then the mysteries of God shall be finished there Comes A Time to see a book becomes an open book are you a man the Bible amen the sincere becomes open power began to break the seals off the Old Testament and began to tell them amen that what's in touch and shadows in time past has become reality in Jesus Christ are you a man the one they met the Lamb of the Old Testament we don't need that anymore work out the Lamb of God to come to take away the sins of the world so all that you've been doing back there won't do now you got to recognize the true Lamb of God and that's Jesus Christ are you a man so at the end of the church dispensation God comes back again and reveals himself in the word and tell us again get away from your thoughts and ideas come back to the Bible amen you know we listen to the voice of the church and the preacher more than we listen to the voice of the word what the Bible says it means nothing to most folks the Bible the word of God means nothing they don't value it you show people what the Bible says but they said but my church says but my preacher says but this is the way I see it oh Lord does the bible mean anything yeah I believe the Bible but um you believe the Bible that's our absolute the word of God man should not live by bread alone but by what every word that proceeded out of the what my for God if you want to see God God is revealed in his word amen and if you want to see God the comforter is the holy spirit Holy Ghost and it comes down in you God should be in his people he should be there but we got a lot of what we got a lot of impersonators of Christianity a lot of people say they are Christians a lot of people say I am saved I am saved to sin not saved from sin are you with me because all have sinned have sinned not still sinning and come short of the glory of God amen but God glory has come and because his glory has come praise God he said my little children are writing to you that you what sin not but if any man sin he has a what Advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous he's the perpetuation for our sins are not for hours only but for the what whole world God comes to love us not to continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid he comes to save us that we can live a Godly life are you with me so I want you to know that I am if you're looking for God you should look to those that say I'm a Christian are you with me because Paul on the way to the Master's Saul of Tasha's persecute the church and the light shine from heaven and he said who are who are they and he said I am he was persecuting the church and he said I am Jesus you see what Jesus is he's not Jesus whom you were persecute are you with me father make them one even as we are amen we must become one with him we cannot in him we live we move and we have our beings God bless you tonight I trust the knife if you're looking for God you know where he lives he lives he lives today he's alive he's not dead but he's living where's he living in his children are you with me the same God now if he's living in you he said the works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to my father isn't that right the same thing he did while he was on Earth he's expecting the same out of you because why you have his life Zoe God's own life the same life that was in Jesus Christ was God's life in God's life has come down to you in the form of the holy spirit so you can do the same things that he did why it's not you this do it but your father that's in you Jesus isn't that right if you have faith you can say to the mountain isn't that right speak the word amen you got to believe who and who you are if you don't know who you are you'll never do the Greater Works are you up man but if you believe that your sons and daughters of God then you would do the work that he did God bless you let us there Hallelujah [Applause] now you got you're gonna go out of here before a dark world into all kind of faces all kind of family members and all kind of people that you're going to be face Moses had a new Egyptian Army he had soldiers and swords he had all kind of powers to come up against him but it wasn't Moses going by himself and you don't have to go fight the enemy on your own please sit go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he didn't believe it or not shall be to him these signs shall follow them
