[19:11] father for we love you
[19:13] in jesus christ's name we pray
[19:15] amen
[19:17] we want to look at the book of
[19:19] philippians tonight
[19:22] by the grace of god
[19:25] philippians 2.
[19:32] god is good amen
[19:43] you know i was thinking tonight as
[19:45] i was in prayer
[19:47] i said lord you know
[19:49] i'm so glad that one one of the things
[19:52] that i found
[19:55] when christ found me was i found rest
[19:57] amen
[19:59] i said you might not realize that
[20:01] realize it but
[20:03] when you were in sin you were taller
[20:05] you're working hard for the devil
[20:08] without finding rest
[20:10] but i said there's one thing that i
[20:12] found
[20:13] in christ and that was rest
[20:16] rest from my sinful works come on i
[20:20] found rest and along with that rest came
[20:22] peace
[20:23] and everything else
[20:25] you know as when when when christ really
[20:27] comes into your life there's nothing in
[20:29] this world that'll shake you
[20:32] things might happen to kind of offset
[20:34] you a little bit i say it like that and
[20:36] maybe throw you off course but so far as
[20:39] it shake your peace and your rest
[20:40] there's nothing that could take that
[20:41] away
[20:42] because he is that peace
[20:45] and you know that long as he's in your
[20:47] heart and he's there with you i don't
[20:48] care how dark that night get
[20:51] how cloudy that storm gets how much that
[20:53] ship might rock
[20:55] feel like it's going to toss over but
[20:57] when christ is there you don't have
[20:58] nothing to worry about
[21:00] how many believe that tonight so i was
[21:02] just thanking the lord for that when i
[21:04] was in prayer today i was just thanking
[21:06] the lord i said thank you for that rest
[21:09] you know you had to have been tall and
[21:11] to know what real rest is
[21:14] working hard to really know what real
[21:16] rest is real rest and what real peace is
[21:19] amen so i was thanking the lord for that
[21:21] tonight and i trust that god that you
[21:23] found that rest amen
[21:25] amen
[21:26] uh philippians by the grace of god
[21:28] philippians 2 and we'll begin at the
[21:30] first verse when you've got to say amen
[21:34] and it reads
[21:35] and if there be therefore any
[21:37] consolation in christ if any comfort of
[21:40] love any fellowship of the spirit if any
[21:43] bowels and mercies
[21:45] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[21:48] having the same love
[21:49] being a one accord of one mind
[21:52] let nothing be done through strife or
[21:54] vain glory but in lowliness of mind let
[21:58] each esteem others better than
[22:00] themselves you may be seated
[22:02] that's a powerful word tonight and it
[22:06] says that
[22:07] you know don't let nothing be done
[22:09] through strife or vainglory but in
[22:11] lowliness of mind
[22:13] it says let each
[22:14] esteem others
[22:16] better than themselves
[22:19] look not every man unto his own things
[22:21] but every man also until the things of
[22:24] others
[22:25] let this mind be in you which was also
[22:28] in christ jesus who being in the form of
[22:31] god
[22:31] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[22:33] god but made himself of no reputation
[22:36] and took upon him the form of a servant
[22:40] and was made in the likeness of men and
[22:42] being found in the fashion of a man he
[22:44] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[22:46] death even the death of the cross
[22:49] wherefore god also have highly exalted
[22:51] him and gave him a name which is above
[22:55] every name
[22:56] that at that name of jesus every knee
[22:58] should bow of things of heaven and
[23:01] things in the earth and things under the
[23:03] earth and that every tongue should
[23:05] confess that jesus christ is lord to the
[23:08] glory of god the father
[23:11] may god bless the reading of his word
[23:12] again tonight by the grace of god i just
[23:15] want to minister to you just for a
[23:16] moment on a little short topic and i
[23:19] entitled it the character of god amen
[23:22] the character of god i says you know
[23:24] here i just reading over this scripture
[23:26] and it and it does something to you
[23:28] because paul
[23:30] here
[23:31] believes
[23:32] speaking out and just telling you you
[23:34] know
[23:35] about the real what real characters like
[23:38] and one of the things
[23:40] he kept pointing out was
[23:42] to you know let every man as we would
[23:44] say it like this just paraphrasing it
[23:47] just look on everybody else don't be
[23:48] concerned about yourself but be
[23:50] concerned about others
[23:52] and that's a problem today with humanity
[23:56] you say that's a problem yes because
[23:58] what's happening now
[24:00] we find that a lot of selfishness
[24:03] in the people and they can't help that
[24:05] because that's the way they were born
[24:07] you we were born selfish we were born
[24:10] worried about ourselves come on
[24:13] and how much we can do
[24:14] for ourselves and that's why we must be
[24:16] born again to get away from that nature
[24:20] that we might take on
[24:21] the the nature of god
[24:24] and that's what it is you know god asks
[24:26] us to display a certain character but he
[24:29] knows within ourselves that we can't
[24:30] live that way he knows that within
[24:33] ourselves we can't produce the type of
[24:36] character that he's requiring for us to
[24:38] produce and that's why he's all said
[24:40] like he says you know you must be born
[24:42] again
[24:43] even tell the disciples you know uh
[24:46] he told peter i believe it was he says
[24:49] after you converted then go strengthen
[24:51] your brothers
[24:52] because it's something that god has to
[24:54] do for you
[24:55] you look at the path sometimes that's
[24:57] set before you and you wonder god how
[25:00] can i walk that path
[25:01] but there's no way you're going to walk
[25:03] that path without christ in you walking
[25:05] that path
[25:06] you'll stumble and fall right by the
[25:08] wayside won't you
[25:10] because you can't walk it but god don't
[25:12] ask you to walk it alone but he but he
[25:14] but he puts his spirit in you and what
[25:16] he wants you to do is get out the way
[25:18] come on and let him like we always say
[25:21] uh take the helm of the ship and guide
[25:24] you and that's what we have a problem
[25:26] with letting god lead and guide us
[25:29] letting god completely take over our
[25:31] lives
[25:32] we have a problem with that because
[25:34] there's so much of our flesh is in the
[25:36] way
[25:37] we got so much of us in a way we we're
[25:39] looking at our statue and and what
[25:42] uh uh uh this is me i let nobody
[25:44] embarrass me ain't gonna let nobody you
[25:46] know uh take advantage of me and now we
[25:48] got too much of that in the way and then
[25:50] god can't have this way you know one
[25:52] thing about christ the whole way to
[25:54] calvary he never thought about being
[25:56] taken advantage of because he knew that
[25:59] you and i needed his help
[26:01] he knew that we couldn't come before god
[26:03] in the shape that we was in so when he
[26:05] wasn't worried about himself he knew
[26:07] that he had to give himself up as an
[26:09] offering for you and i that you and i
[26:11] might be able to be saved tonight
[26:14] so looking at him
[26:16] marking the perfect man come on
[26:18] and i said that's the man without the
[26:20] mark tonight how many believe that
[26:22] but i said the character of god i say
[26:24] human nature is is is is always to be uh
[26:27] self-centered come on me and mine
[26:31] that's how it is i'm worried about me
[26:33] and mine
[26:34] i ain't worried about this in my house
[26:36] it's my my family my long as we all
[26:38] right come on
[26:40] that's that's just the way we are
[26:42] within ourselves
[26:44] but god wants to get us away from that
[26:46] you know one thing
[26:48] when when they when they ask jesus one
[26:50] time tempting them they said what what's
[26:52] the greatest commandment and he said to
[26:54] love thy lord the lord thy god with all
[26:56] our heart with all that mind and soul
[26:59] he said this is the first commandment i
[27:01] think it was matthew 22 chapter he says
[27:04] but the second one he said is the the
[27:06] love thy neighbor is thyself
[27:08] come on didn't he say that
[27:10] and he says that that doesn't take away
[27:12] from the first he said on this hang all
[27:14] the law in the prophets
[27:17] come on the love thy neighbor as thyself
[27:20] think about it you know i said that i
[27:22] was thinking about something that uh
[27:24] uh uh the the the young man that got
[27:27] killed years ago emmett till as mama was
[27:30] saying she was saying that you know when
[27:32] she used to always see about the
[27:34] civil rights movements and all these
[27:36] things she said well she's living in
[27:37] chicago that ain't got nothing to do
[27:39] with me come on she said because that
[27:41] ain't my problem that's their problem
[27:43] until her son got killed
[27:45] then she realized that a problem for for
[27:48] those in the south was a problem
[27:49] everywhere come on
[27:51] but that's what it is sometimes you know
[27:53] we look at you know in that world has
[27:56] that problem not only the world the
[27:57] church has that problem oh that's just
[27:59] them that ain't us that ain't me come on
[28:02] but you got to realize the way the devil
[28:04] fighting them he might be fighting you
[28:05] like that tomorrow come on so what did
[28:08] that cause us to do cause us to pray for
[28:10] one another pray for that one it might
[28:13] not be my home but lord help him
[28:15] god help them through their time of
[28:17] trouble and they time a tribulation i
[28:19] know they're going through with their
[28:20] children god help them it might not be
[28:22] me today be today but remember that
[28:24] devil that's fighting them today he
[28:26] might be at your door tomorrow and
[28:28] you're going to need somebody to pray
[28:29] for you
[28:30] come on to pull down those strongholds
[28:32] then you'll wish that somebody would
[28:34] care about you because that's what it's
[28:36] all about how many believe that tonight
[28:38] it's about the caring that's what it is
[28:41] that's when we can really pull down
[28:43] strongholds
[28:44] really get down into fervent prayer for
[28:46] one another when you consider that hey
[28:48] lord we always say that that isn't their
[28:51] child but these are our children come on
[28:54] how many believe that tonight
[28:57] isn't just like to say brother gordon's
[28:59] children these are our children
[29:01] come on we can say it like that can we
[29:03] say it like that tonight come on so we
[29:05] find our way praying come on we got to
[29:08] keep the devil off off of us how many
[29:10] believe that tonight but we find that i
[29:13] said that's in the
[29:15] real nature of god so sometimes you know
[29:18] we we find we find ourselves
[29:21] always trying to get to that place the
[29:24] lord
[29:25] help me
[29:26] to express the character that you want
[29:28] me to express
[29:30] i don't want to build up my own
[29:32] self-image
[29:34] and all these things and that's a
[29:36] problem people want to build up their
[29:37] self-image when you do that don't you
[29:39] know god ain't in it
[29:41] because you're worried about yourself
[29:43] but you got to get away from building up
[29:45] your self-image god i want to project
[29:47] you lord and we find out here even in
[29:50] the scriptures how you know uh uh here
[29:54] how paul was laying it out and how he
[29:56] says though you know
[29:58] he he thought it not robbery to be equal
[30:00] with god come on but he humbled himself
[30:02] he made himself low
[30:05] come on
[30:06] the god of glory don't you know that you
[30:08] know all that god was he poured into
[30:11] christ
[30:12] what we seen out of the life of christ
[30:15] was the expression of the character of
[30:18] god
[30:19] of all god was we saw through the
[30:22] prophets and all those of those all
[30:24] those of old they displayed just a
[30:26] certain part of who he was come on they
[30:29] can only you can only see parts of them
[30:31] but when christ came on the scene he was
[30:33] the fullness of it
[30:35] and that's what it is the people
[30:37] couldn't see it in the fullness of it in
[30:40] the manifestation of it they they
[30:41] couldn't recognize who he was and that's
[30:43] why they can treat him any kind of way
[30:45] come on but he showed them what the
[30:48] character of god was like he showed them
[30:50] what it was like to walk lowly
[30:52] hallelujah come on he he made himself
[30:56] like the bible say of no reputation
[30:58] can you imagine that the god of glory
[31:01] the one who came down
[31:03] you know that worshipped of angels the
[31:05] creator of the world come on he made the
[31:08] world and he came to his own and his own
[31:10] received him not
[31:11] the the creator of becoming a part of
[31:13] his own creation but yet
[31:16] he didn't even think of it to leave of
[31:17] himself of no reputation
[31:19] but i believe in his mind the whole time
[31:21] he said it's written of me to do thy
[31:23] will oh god come on i just come to the
[31:26] in the volume of the book i just want to
[31:27] do what the will of god is
[31:29] and that's what it is when we you know
[31:32] you had to be in bad shape uh and when
[31:35] god saved you you had to realize how bad
[31:37] of a shape you were in if you didn't
[31:39] realize that then you wouldn't never
[31:41] really save right
[31:42] come on because you didn't recognize the
[31:44] need of a savior but once you realize
[31:47] how bad you were how low you were come
[31:50] on how in darkness you were how naked
[31:52] how blind you were hallelujah and
[31:55] everybody turned their back on you you
[31:57] found a way some somewhere in your
[31:58] spirit you reached out for god
[32:00] hallelujah god if you would help me i
[32:03] ain't even worthy but god if you would
[32:05] come by my way lord if you would stop
[32:08] and hear my cry because you saw how low
[32:10] you were hallelujah and how much god
[32:13] that you needed
[32:16] and what happened i don't know about you
[32:18] but i felt myself that way one day
[32:20] and god came by
[32:22] and if god came by there and lifted me
[32:24] up hallelujah every time i think that
[32:27] hey he's somebody you got this that i
[32:30] just go back down that that down that
[32:32] road go back to that place the way god
[32:35] brought you from i go back to that place
[32:37] the way i cried hallelujah and everybody
[32:40] looked at you and talked about you and i
[32:42] go back to that place where i cried out
[32:44] to god
[32:45] hallelujah and i said god i think about
[32:47] david he said go tell david i brought
[32:50] him from the sheet coat come on when he
[32:52] was a nobody hallelujah
[32:54] and i established them ain't you glad
[32:56] tonight that that's what god done for
[32:58] you
[32:59] hallelujah
[33:00] then where's bragging come on
[33:03] where's all these things at
[33:05] come on what place do those things do
[33:08] these things have in your life they
[33:10] don't have any do they
[33:12] recognize what god done how many believe
[33:14] that tonight
[33:15] i said but what it is you know
[33:17] the character of god you know you look
[33:20] at how meek and lowly jesus was
[33:23] you look at
[33:24] how humble he was
[33:26] and how he walked on the earth come on
[33:29] like i like that saying jesus with dirty
[33:31] feet
[33:32] you know he didn't even have a place to
[33:33] lay his head come on
[33:35] right there
[33:36] most of sinners the tax collectors and
[33:38] the harlots the humble come on but yet
[33:40] you had the pharisees in the scribes
[33:42] come on all those walking with their
[33:44] head high eating maybe at king's tables
[33:48] but yet he was he was not only 18 he was
[33:50] the king come on
[33:52] but yet look at what he chose to display
[33:54] himself come on and the bible says that
[33:57] god gave him a name that was above every
[33:59] name
[34:00] come on he showed us the way
[34:02] up was down didn't he
[34:05] showed us the way to the top so we find
[34:07] ourselves sometimes in what it is that
[34:10] type of humility it ain't you know
[34:12] people can put it on but he ain't asking
[34:14] for no put on come on
[34:16] but when the holy ghost really comes in
[34:18] your life
[34:19] come on the quickening power really gets
[34:21] down on the inside it won't be no put on
[34:24] because that light is so bright
[34:25] hallelujah it'll show you how dark you
[34:28] are come on it'll bring a reverence in
[34:30] your life i believe that with all of my
[34:33] heart do you believe that tonight come
[34:35] on so that's what we find i said lord
[34:38] you know it's something
[34:40] you know
[34:41] god was in christ
[34:43] reconciling the world to himself
[34:46] when he came come on
[34:48] he dwelled in there what he wanted to do
[34:50] he wanted to reconcile the world back to
[34:52] him
[34:53] he knew that you and i were lost
[34:55] so he wanted to do something hallelujah
[34:58] that nobody else couldn't do
[35:00] you know no angel nobody was good enough
[35:02] to do what he did
[35:03] he couldn't send nobody else
[35:05] you say way to glory at don't let's
[35:07] don't even talk about the preacher come
[35:09] on let's don't talk about the bishop the
[35:11] apostle let's talk about jesus christ
[35:13] he was the one hallelujah his blood that
[35:16] was shed he was the only one that could
[35:18] do it
[35:19] hallelujah he was the only one that
[35:22] could save us
[35:23] from our sins
[35:25] to reconcile us back to god
[35:27] no matter how good a man been how many
[35:30] actual works that man did he was the
[35:32] only one that can reconcile us back that
[35:34] was his purpose when he came back come
[35:37] on
[35:38] i want to reconcile him back that
[35:40] fellowship that was lost i want to bring
[35:42] it back
[35:43] hallelujah
[35:44] i thank god for bringing us back into
[35:46] fellowship with him
[35:48] oh god hallelujah come on born in the
[35:51] world you didn't even know what it was
[35:53] about
[35:54] come on thinking oh it's just going to
[35:56] church and all these things all it's
[35:57] just what is it all about you didn't
[35:59] know what that life was about
[36:01] until one day come on
[36:03] god start working on the inside
[36:06] he started pulling on that seed
[36:08] hallelujah that he placed in there
[36:10] before the beginning of time i thank god
[36:13] for that that it was by election don't
[36:15] you know many of us would have never
[36:17] chose this way
[36:18] come on but by election
[36:21] god put something on the inside of you
[36:23] one day he began to call in on that
[36:26] election that seed that was on the
[36:28] inside and i don't care how clouded it
[36:31] was by the world
[36:33] come on in darkness
[36:36] it was clouded by those things covered
[36:38] up but when god began to call on it you
[36:42] couldn't explain it
[36:43] something was drawing you out
[36:45] and i thank god for the drawing out how
[36:48] many thank god for the drawing out
[36:49] tonight i said ain't you glad that god
[36:51] dropped you out tonight hallelujah
[36:54] ain't you glad that you it was something
[36:56] different about you than everybody else
[36:59] come on
[37:00] you was an oddball
[37:02] but what it was it was god that did it
[37:04] come on i thank god for that tonight but
[37:07] i said what it is the character of god
[37:10] he was displaying something come on
[37:13] god was in christ what he was doing uh
[37:15] or displaying something in you i mean
[37:18] displaying something within himself of
[37:20] showing what real
[37:21] christianity is like
[37:23] don't you know that today the world
[37:25] don't know what christianity is
[37:28] they lost
[37:29] they lost at that part
[37:31] come on they don't know what real
[37:33] christianity is like
[37:35] they don't really know what
[37:36] you know
[37:38] the spirit of god is coming down into a
[37:41] man's life
[37:42] cleaning them up
[37:44] they don't know they use that phrase
[37:45] born again
[37:47] any kind of way come on
[37:49] they use the term the holy ghost any
[37:51] type of way come on but they don't
[37:53] really know what it's like
[37:54] come on how do you say that because you
[37:57] can look at the life that they live
[37:59] come on it ain't producing the word
[38:02] come on it ain't producing the life of
[38:04] christ it ain't doing what the bible
[38:06] declared it would do so you call it like
[38:09] it is
[38:10] come on
[38:11] hallelujah you know i think about jesus
[38:14] and jesus began to talk about the
[38:16] pharisees come on he just began to call
[38:18] and said it you know the separate
[38:20] countries and all these things said
[38:21] their wider rules they full of dead men
[38:23] bones come on all corruption
[38:26] i believe john the baptist when he saw
[38:28] him hallelujah call them snakes vipers
[38:31] he said who warned you to flee the wrath
[38:33] to come come on though they might have
[38:35] been dressed in white robes
[38:38] going to church the preachers of that
[38:39] day
[38:40] come on the life that they was
[38:42] projecting what in the life of christ
[38:45] and i said today what does god find
[38:47] today
[38:48] people do the same thing having church
[38:50] in church come on but the life they
[38:52] projected ain't the life of christ
[38:55] come on i said lord give us something
[38:57] real
[38:58] hallelujah something that'll change a
[39:00] man from where he is and bring him to a
[39:03] real birth hallelujah
[39:06] take the taste of alcohol out of his
[39:07] mouth he can have a testimony and i
[39:10] ain't the shame of who i was
[39:13] hallelujah
[39:14] a real birth come on
[39:16] you know i was thinking i thank god i
[39:18] was sharing my sister-in-law kente
[39:21] was telling me the other day when
[39:23] brother damon was testifying i could
[39:25] never imagine seeing you do any things
[39:27] that they talk about
[39:28] i said thank the lord for the new birth
[39:32] because what it is people of old they
[39:34] know you and they can't believe you live
[39:36] the way you live
[39:37] they can't believe it but then the
[39:39] people that didn't know you they they
[39:41] can't believe you lived that way what it
[39:43] is because they were two different
[39:44] people come on
[39:46] two different natures hallelujah it's
[39:49] the nature of god hallelujah now
[39:52] what it is and that's what you want you
[39:54] want something when christ comes in you
[39:56] come on he says all things will become
[39:58] new
[39:59] come on not that you wondering have i
[40:02] been changed or not but when the holy
[40:04] ghost comes in you you'll know that
[40:06] something quick in you because you ain't
[40:08] dead no more to those things your whole
[40:10] appetite has changed
[40:12] hallelujah the life of christ is in you
[40:16] and what it is it's about that personal
[40:18] relationship
[40:19] you know i was sharing with the church
[40:21] the other other week i was saying you
[40:23] know when you when just coming to church
[40:26] that's only maybe 10
[40:28] of this whole journey
[40:29] come on i said but this you don't just
[40:32] say i'm just a christian just here i
[40:34] said but it's only 10 come on the life
[40:37] that you live
[40:38] come on most of the time you ain't even
[40:40] in the building i said let's see what
[40:41] kind of life you're living out there
[40:43] that's what's going to testify no matter
[40:45] how much you dance shout sing speak in
[40:48] tongues none of that even matters what
[40:49] kind of life are you producing
[40:52] hallelujah it's the life of christ and
[40:54] if you can't see that life when you get
[40:56] up in the morning
[40:58] or when you lay down at night then you
[41:00] got to get on the alt and die again cry
[41:03] out for more of god i don't know about
[41:05] you but i need more of god every day
[41:08] every morning every hour i need more of
[41:10] his spirit power hallelujah with the
[41:14] things we're fighting against today come
[41:16] on the battles
[41:17] this is sad i was seeing something
[41:21] and how they were saying about the
[41:23] mothers are tired of losing their
[41:25] children to gun violence
[41:27] it was a whole crowd of mothers
[41:29] every one of them was black
[41:31] i said that that hurt your heart come on
[41:34] why i said we need god
[41:36] to help us come on we need prayer in the
[41:39] homes again need prayer
[41:41] somebody hallelujah
[41:44] call on god
[41:46] how many believe that tonight come on
[41:48] not taken away but it's the truth you
[41:51] know we need god more than we think we
[41:52] do
[41:54] come on that's the pr that's a problem
[41:56] we need god more than we think we need
[41:58] them
[41:59] hallelujah
[42:00] but we find i says you know what it is
[42:03] uh christ like it says reconciling what
[42:05] he what he was showing the
[42:06] characteristics of god he was showing
[42:09] you know uh uh
[42:11] of real what real christianity was like
[42:14] come on
[42:15] he was showing it to us how many believe
[42:17] that tonight
[42:19] come on
[42:20] and i says god
[42:21] you know when you know when you look in
[42:23] the word what reflection are you seeing
[42:27] a lot of times you know i says what
[42:29] happens
[42:31] a lot of times we can look at characters
[42:33] in the bible and this is what this is
[42:35] what
[42:36] sometimes the enemy calls a person to do
[42:39] they'll look at their mistakes and their
[42:41] flaws a lot of times you hear them say
[42:44] you know david was a man after god's own
[42:46] heart and look what he did and god
[42:48] forgave him so nobody can't judge me
[42:51] that's the attitude of the world was
[42:53] also a trick of the devil come on
[42:56] you know that you know that's the uk the
[42:59] bible said for those that willfully sin
[43:01] come on there won't be no forgiveness
[43:04] for that
[43:05] you know david was a man after god's own
[43:07] heart that's because he possessed
[43:08] certain qualities come on there's
[43:10] certain qualities that david possessed
[43:13] david was willing to repent too wasn't
[43:15] he and i believe if it was laid before
[43:17] him again that david wouldn't do those
[43:19] things but a lot of times you know we
[43:22] use other people's faults and
[43:23] transgressions to the devil trick you to
[43:27] use those things as a cloak for your
[43:29] sins come on
[43:30] but we shouldn't use those things as a
[43:32] cloak come on
[43:33] but we should what follow after the
[43:35] things that are right and pure
[43:37] you sometimes we might get caught in a
[43:39] snare or a trap but what happens the
[43:42] holy spirit be quick to convict you and
[43:45] bring you back to a place the way you
[43:46] say god i need your mercy lord cast me
[43:50] not away from thy presence come on take
[43:52] not that holy spirit away from me
[43:54] restoring to me the joy of my salvation
[43:57] a man to be quick to repent
[43:59] do you believe that tonight
[44:01] hallelujah i believe that
[44:04] but i said that's what happens come on a
[44:06] lot of times you know we we just got to
[44:09] be careful what the enemy does
[44:11] come on
[44:13] what the enemy
[44:15] is seeking to do
[44:17] in each and every one of our lives
[44:20] i said that you know each one of those
[44:22] each one of those characters they
[44:23] displayed
[44:25] certain parts of them but christ himself
[44:28] when he came he was the fullness of it
[44:30] come on
[44:31] showing us
[44:32] or what the real i don't want to belong
[44:33] what the real character of god is like
[44:35] come on and i said god looking at the
[44:38] scriptures you can go home and re read
[44:40] it uh finish reading it yourself you
[44:42] know and i was gonna go over to hebrews
[44:43] 10 and how you know
[44:46] paul was talking about call back the
[44:48] days of old he says when you were made
[44:50] of gays in stock and all these things
[44:52] because why you didn't mind
[44:54] going through for christ why because you
[44:56] know you needed this help
[44:58] you knew you needed god's help and you
[45:00] was willing to do anything to get god's
[45:02] help but what happens to a person
[45:06] to to a human a person in that christian
[45:08] walk god lifts them up
[45:11] out of the tragic situations
[45:14] god lifts them up out of the pits of
[45:16] hell come on
[45:17] and as soon as they get lifted up won't
[45:19] be long before they forget the one that
[45:21] brought them
[45:22] come on then beginning to feel as though
[45:25] they're strong and they can do things on
[45:26] their own but remember you can't do
[45:28] nothing on your own come on without god
[45:31] hold in your hand do you believe that
[45:32] tonight amen
[45:35] [Applause]
[46:04] praise the lord amen
[46:07] i thank god that
[46:10] the private of god said one thing you'll
[46:11] take out you bought nothing in this
[46:13] world one thing you take out is your
[46:14] character
[46:16] amen
[46:18] so here we are
[46:20] traveling through this world what it's
[46:22] got
[46:23] he's looking for character
[46:25] amen he's looking for
[46:27] and i was back there listening and i
[46:29] said
[46:31] the church is the body of christ
[46:35] and um
[46:37] we have to look
[46:40] and see
[46:41] our lives
[46:43] can we be called the body of christ
[46:46] he said not
[46:49] not just
[46:54] the holy ghost being a
[46:56] a different person than jesus christ but
[46:58] it's the same person
[47:01] the holy ghost is jesus christ the same
[47:03] person that we preach about we talk
[47:06] about
[47:06] but the holy ghost is the same person
[47:10] it's not three persons in the god it's
[47:12] the same person
[47:14] amen
[47:15] and that same person must be your pur
[47:17] must be the person of jesus christ to
[47:20] you amen in reality form and your life
[47:23] being transformed and changed into that
[47:26] image
[47:28] that we'll see jesus christ and not
[47:30] ourselves
[47:32] amen
[47:33] and so that's
[47:34] the purpose
[47:36] of jesus christ coming back
[47:38] in the form of the holy ghost amen that
[47:40] you might have the same power
[47:43] the same god living and manifesting
[47:46] himself in you
[47:48] praise god if god manifests himself in
[47:50] you
[47:51] even then the works that he did you'll
