Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. And every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are what? &gt;&gt; Clean through the word. You're clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. He said what? Abide &gt;&gt; in me &gt;&gt; and I &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide &gt;&gt; in the vine. &gt;&gt; Abide in the vine. No more can ye except ye what? &gt;&gt; Abide in me. &gt;&gt; Abide in me. I am the vine. and ye are the branches. He that abideth in me and I where &gt;&gt; in him &gt;&gt; the same bringeth forth much fruit. For without me you can do &gt;&gt; nothing. If a man abide not in me, he's cast forth as a branch and is withered. And men gather them and they are cast them into &gt;&gt; the fire. &gt;&gt; The fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they are what? &gt;&gt; Burned. &gt;&gt; They are burnt. If ye are what? &gt;&gt; Abide in me. &gt;&gt; If you abide in me and my word, &gt;&gt; abide in you, &gt;&gt; ye shall what? Ask what you will &gt;&gt; and it shall be &gt;&gt; done unto you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let me receive this. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I was just, you know, still continuing on with that little message the prophet spoke on spiritual atmosphere. Amen. So by the grace of God uh it it's good to create an atmosphere where God can presence can be there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the prophet was talking about living in the shakana glory. Living in the presence of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very important that that we live in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the shana glory of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's it's it's not enough just to come to church. It's not enough to say I'm a Christian. It's not enough to say I'm a I'm saved. Amen. He said so many people, Amen. that say I'm a Christian. They say I'm saved. Amen. But they don't live in the presence and they're not living in the shakana glory. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Okay, abide in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Jesus said. abide in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very important that we abide in him &gt;&gt; because um the devil will get do everything he can do to you to keep you from abiding in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil will uh put all kind of snails. He'll try to woo you. He'll try to bring you out. Make you Amen. make it difficult &gt;&gt; for your life. Amen. He attempt you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He got Eve to come uh when she was fortified behind the word. He got her to doubt the word and to come from behind the her fortification, her protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the word of God. &gt;&gt; But he got her to come from behind the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the devil, he'll try to woo you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, every one of us, if you're a Christian and you're saved, uh, you have, you know, he said Adam and Eve when he created them, he said, uh, be fruitful and what? &gt;&gt; Multiply. &gt;&gt; So, God is saying here, Amen. He wants to you, Amen, to be fruitful and multiply. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your life uh amen ought to be uh your light ought to shine when men could come to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So be fruitful and multiply. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you as an individual, you should have so many people attached to your life that they have eternal life because they came in contact with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you Amen. was able Amen. to give a life. Amen. Just like Jesus life, amen, by his light shining, giving his life by you, amen, being crucified and giving your life to God, it causes, Amen. others to be saved. Amen. Through the crucifixion of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I die daily. I'm crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but Christ live in me." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're seeing a resurrected Jesus, a resurrected life, which is a new life. Amen. We're seeing a new creation, new creatures in Christ. &gt;&gt; See what I'm saying? Abide in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We just can't just Amen. go so far. Amen. You know, some fell upon stony grounds. Amen. They it didn't get root and didn't go deep enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some fell upon thrones and things choked his life or choke the life at you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Abide in me." &gt;&gt; So many things there to uh try to keep you from abiding. &gt;&gt; But you must be determined. I'm going to abide in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. God makes it possible, amen, for you to abide in him. Amen. Because you you you'll pass through justification and sanctification. You've gone on into the holy of holiness. &gt;&gt; There where the shakana glory is, there curtains, amen, falls back behind you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There, amen. There in the shakana glory of God, there amen. You don't have to worry about the seven golden candlesticks. You don't have to worry about the changing in the atmosphere uh into the atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're moving to them in
