[37:16] fruits may God blessed to the reading of
[37:18] his word just for for a short moment
[37:21] tonight and I just want to kind of just
[37:24] go over a lot of it I want to talk about
[37:26] challenging God's order
[37:56] amen
[38:26] e
[38:56] e
[39:26] e e
[40:07] ordered it that's how it's going to be
[40:09] however God called it out that's how
[40:11] it's going to be so when we talking
[40:12] about challenging God's order right we
[40:15] that can be a good thing or a bad thing
[40:18] when I say challenging it because you
[40:21] can you can challenge God's order in a
[40:23] way to where you're asking God to keep
[40:26] his word right you're asking God to to
[40:29] keep his end to the deal right and many
[40:33] times he asks he not many of times but I
[40:35] know it's in Malachi 3 he even told him
[40:38] he says uh to prove me right and see w't
[40:41] I do what I said right because God's got
[40:44] order what the way God said it that's
[40:46] the way it'll be and that's you know we
[40:48] find in sometimes that that even in in
[40:52] that that's our strength right that
[40:54] that's our stronghold even in that know
[40:57] that the way God ordered it that's the
[41:00] way that's the way it's got to be no
[41:02] matter how bleak a situation might look
[41:05] no matter how uh uh worse the situation
[41:09] might get right if the way God ordered
[41:12] it come on and if you keep holding on
[41:15] you keep staying faithful steadfast and
[41:18] in the will of God no matter how Bleak
[41:20] it is you watch God show up because it's
[41:24] one thing that God can't do and that's
[41:28] break his word he can't do that he can't
[41:31] he gonna keep all his promises it's not
[41:34] not a time where he'll say I can't come
[41:37] through this time right or I'm not able
[41:40] to do it this time it's never a time
[41:44] that that that that God will ever it'll
[41:46] ever be that way because you know what
[41:49] God is he doesn't need a a uh this
[41:52] support or that support he's a Creator
[41:55] All In by himself right amen he's
[41:58] omnipotent he's omnipresent God is he is
[42:01] all all by
[42:03] himself right he doesn't need support
[42:05] from this and that all he wants is is
[42:08] somebody to believe him for one come on
[42:11] it's not that's why we say we walk by
[42:13] faith and not by sight it's not what you
[42:15] see but it's what you believe in right
[42:19] but I say challenging God's order a lot
[42:21] of times you know uh uh uh people and
[42:25] that's why we say that God is saying if
[42:27] you didn't do this you didn't because
[42:29] people for some reason they don't want
[42:32] to do what God asked
[42:34] them or only part of what God asked them
[42:37] put it that way but they want the
[42:39] blessings you find that I've been doing
[42:41] a lot of witnessing lately at the job
[42:43] you find a lot of times people want the
[42:45] good and they want the blessings right
[42:48] they want to chase a thousand they want
[42:51] the the the Earth to yield its Harvest
[42:53] to them they want this they want that
[42:55] but then they don't want to walk in his
[42:58] statues they don't want to do all that
[43:00] God asked them to do but they want the
[43:02] blessings right so what happens is they
[43:05] get the flip side and then instead of
[43:09] lining up with God or or making things
[43:12] right then they try to go another route
[43:14] around come on but you can't break God's
[43:16] order you can't challenge God's order
[43:18] right you only put yourself then on a
[43:21] downward spiral let's say it that way
[43:23] right because and it's some people that
[43:26] go to that extent
[43:27] but I don't know about you tonight but I
[43:30] say one thing about it uh uh uh we look
[43:33] at the the economy and everything
[43:35] shaking we you know look at the the
[43:37] things that's unfolding and it's only
[43:39] one Safe Haven right it's only one thing
[43:43] right now and I know it's been in my
[43:45] spirit that only one thing that I'm got
[43:49] all of my confidence in right now and
[43:51] that is all of my confidence is in that
[43:55] God is going to keep his
[43:57] word that God is going to keep us even
[44:01] in the midst of all of this crisis God
[44:04] is going to keep
[44:05] us come on that's why all my confidence
[44:09] right now you know it it I was praying
[44:12] think yesterday laying laying there and
[44:14] I was just meditating on the Lord and I
[44:16] said you know God I'm just going to I'm
[44:19] I'm praising God and saying Lord you
[44:21] know telling God how Mighty he is how
[44:24] Mighty he is how powerful how great he
[44:26] is these things don't move
[44:29] me because of the god that I serve these
[44:32] things don't move me come on whatever
[44:34] God takes you through bringing you
[44:36] through right sometimes you don't
[44:38] understand you you might uh uh uh
[44:40] question ask why but it's one thing you
[44:43] know that that he is still the master of
[44:46] the wind he still got it all un control
[44:48] right you're not intimidated not shaken
[44:52] by these winds because you know whom you
[44:54] serve you know I was talking with a guy
[44:57] the other day uh at the job and he was
[45:00] you know going and he was saying he
[45:01] study this he's that and and and you
[45:04] know sometimes you can be unstable
[45:06] because you don't even really know what
[45:08] you believe right something new come out
[45:12] then you fallowing that something new
[45:13] come out you fallowing that so you don't
[45:15] really have no stability right but once
[45:20] you it's one thing about when you find
[45:23] that Solid Rock when once you you know I
[45:26] was sharing with the young uh uh uh
[45:29] people the other day not the my little
[45:32] children and the niece and nephews about
[45:34] experience with God I said no matter
[45:36] what you got to have your own experience
[45:38] with God when you get a personal
[45:41] experience with God you know the Lord
[45:44] ter trials and lives and Sh things in
[45:46] this life uh uh uh going to come right
[45:50] but once you know God for yourself once
[45:53] you met you know the pillar of fire as
[45:56] we say
[45:57] once you had an experience with God is
[46:00] nothing can shake you from that and the
[46:03] trials of life it's things in this life
[46:05] that's going to come and it's going to
[46:07] try your foundation that you own come on
[46:11] it's things that's going to try your
[46:13] beliefs it's meant to be that way but
[46:16] one thing about it when you went deep
[46:19] enough come on the hardest wind can blow
[46:22] you know where you standing at you know
[46:24] I was sharing a guy last night some and
[46:27] testimonies of of the trials of life and
[46:29] I said the thing is when this thing hit
[46:32] you know sometimes people ran to the
[46:34] wrong Source right for relief for the
[46:38] wrong source for to ease the pain right
[46:42] now they find themselves way in the
[46:44] worse mess
[46:47] right than it was from the beginning I
[46:49] says but when all these things were
[46:52] happening and all these things were
[46:54] going on I said there's one thing that
[46:56] held me together and that was God
[46:59] himself right I said the Holy Ghost in
[47:02] those times cuz he was talking about the
[47:04] Holy Ghost I don't think you really know
[47:07] what it is but I said what the Holy
[47:10] Ghost does in those times you know when
[47:14] you can't hold it together when you
[47:16] don't have the answers and it comes like
[47:18] that sometimes you don't know you don't
[47:21] have the answers you but in those times
[47:24] when all your strength is gone
[47:26] those times come on that's when he takes
[47:30] over come on he gives you what it takes
[47:34] to endure through whatever you're
[47:35] dealing with come on but if he's not
[47:39] there you going to have it Harden come
[47:42] on if he ain't there you going to find
[47:44] out in those times you wasn't where you
[47:47] thought you was come on that's the truth
[47:50] come on cuz God will get you sometimes
[47:52] you you can handle situations now
[47:55] because you but when when when when that
[47:58] Storm Come hard enough
[48:00] Hallelujah come on it'll come hard ones
[48:04] will
[48:05] come then you're going to find out was
[48:07] you built for it or not right you'll
[48:10] find out but one thing about it I'm I'm
[48:13] so glad tonight that God has showed me
[48:16] over and over again that he'll never
[48:18] fail he showed me over and over again
[48:21] that he's that solid rock
[48:23] hallelujah winds blow God showed me over
[48:26] and over again I'll never fail you amen
[48:29] he showed me time and time again that it
[48:31] ain't you it's me anyhow hallelujah oh
[48:35] Jesus but when I think about those
[48:37] things that's what I was I was sharing
[48:39] with fellow last night I said sometimes
[48:42] you know we can be so saved to where you
[48:46] forgot where God brought you from So You
[48:49] Don't Have Mercy and compassion and
[48:51] Grace on others cuz you forgot where God
[48:53] brought you from I said but if you were
[48:55] like me one day h Hallelujah you were so
[48:58] deep far out there I didn't know it one
[49:02] time but God when he open your eyes to
[49:05] see the condition that you really were
[49:08] in Hallelujah and how much of God's help
[49:12] you needed and he helped you from then
[49:15] on you can't never look at nobody a
[49:16] certain way right you pray for you'll
[49:19] pray for people then right but I said
[49:21] God's got order doesn't he come on and
[49:23] to stay in God's order is to be blessed
[49:26] y'all believe that tonight I know you do
[49:28] but to St God's order like I says I was
[49:31] reading even here in Leviticus and
[49:33] looking I says oh how God wants to bless
[49:36] us how God loves us how God you know he
[49:39] wants to take care of your every all and
[49:42] all he ask you to do like he said the
[49:43] beginning if you walk in my statues come
[49:45] on God help us to walk but people they
[49:48] want all those bless they they they skip
[49:51] that part if you're walking my statues
[49:53] they want everything else right come on
[49:56] but God's got order and that order can't
[49:58] be
[49:59] broken you know one thing I was sharing
[50:01] with my my my in-laws last night I says
[50:05] one thing about you know challenging
[50:07] God's
[50:08] order you know a lot of
[50:12] times the problem we have today is
[50:15] everybody want to be
[50:17] somebody is that the truth everybody
[50:21] want to be somebody right I was sharing
[50:24] the guy the other night I said one man
[50:27] tell you he got it all or they got it
[50:28] all and you following this man he got it
[50:31] all I said he ain't got it all I said
[50:33] God is too too big and too great he
[50:35] can't he he can't have it all like that
[50:38] right but people that I said everybody
[50:41] want to be somebody come on everybody
[50:44] want to be the man of the hour don't
[50:47] they I was preaching the other night but
[50:50] it's the truth ain't it but you find out
[50:54] a lot of times you wasn't built for it
[50:57] right I thought about
[51:00] Moses when when God Called Moses Moses
[51:04] tried his best to get out of it didn't
[51:06] he he's beg God no Lord not me don't put
[51:10] this burden on me right A lot of people
[51:12] wouldn't have done that would they but
[51:14] he didn't want it he' rather just stay
[51:17] normal comment but God said no I've
[51:20] called you so look at the I was looking
[51:23] at the the things that he went through
[51:26] right
[51:27] to be a leader he went through some
[51:30] stuff didn't he with his own family come
[51:33] on with the own people that he went
[51:36] through a lot and I could see maybe his
[51:39] heart's
[51:40] burden for those people because he knew
[51:43] God was going to bring
[51:45] judgment he know no good wasn't going to
[51:47] come out of it right sometimes what they
[51:50] got to do their own thing breaking not
[51:52] going to do their own thing or or want
[51:53] to do this we going to do that we going
[51:55] to do that most knew the order of God
[51:58] and it couldn't be broken and I can see
[52:00] his heart bleeding sometimes when he
[52:03] tried to stop the people
[52:06] right but they get mad with him
[52:09] Hallelujah many times God would have
[52:12] destroyed him but Moses the leader the
[52:14] one they kicked up against
[52:16] right called him all kind of but he was
[52:19] the meekest man wasn't
[52:22] he and and and one they didn't know he
[52:24] was back there standing before God lord
[52:27] don't destroy many of times right come
[52:31] on I says but the problem he had in the
[52:35] camp everybody want to be somebody
[52:38] didn't they come on I thought about
[52:41] thought about
[52:43] um his sister I said God God's order in
[52:47] God's order right it ain't going it's no
[52:51] Family Lines right no friendships and
[52:53] all that when it comes down to the order
[52:55] of God now God don't got no respect to
[52:57] persons right but he does have respect
[53:00] to
[53:00] officers come on that's the truth ain't
[53:04] it many times people just think oh it's
[53:07] a brother or sister whatever come on
[53:10] but I was thinking about how Miriam I
[53:13] think it was numbers
[53:14] 12 and how she begin to says God only
[53:18] spoken to Moses see want to be somebody
[53:21] right and God may have used them and he
[53:24] did use them
[53:27] come on God did speak to them did use
[53:29] them but at that time Moses was the man
[53:31] of hour wasn't he come on he didn't want
[53:35] to be it but he was right and all he was
[53:38] trying to do was give them a word from
[53:41] God right all he was trying to do is
[53:44] stand there and take them to places that
[53:47] God want to get them to but he had to
[53:50] fight with him and struggle with him the
[53:52] whole way to get there didn't he
[53:53] Hallelujah come on cuz everybody want to
[53:57] be somebody ain't it come on Miriam
[54:01] knows that God only spoke more he spoke
[54:03] to us her and Aaron but the Bible says
[54:05] God heard it come on God heard it didn't
[54:09] he come on God is listening right
[54:13] now God was listening last night wasn't
[54:16] he God heard it come on and he comes
[54:20] down to visit the people sometimes don't
[54:22] he come on that's why I said Lord let
[54:25] the words from my mouth and the
[54:27] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[54:30] your sight because God is listening amen
[54:33] God heard what you said at home didn't
[54:35] he God heard it Hallelujah and he came
[54:39] down didn't
[54:41] he
[54:42] sometimes Hallelujah I was I was sharing
[54:45] this the other night sometimes people
[54:48] kicking fight come on it's God's order
[54:52] Moses didn't want to tell people what he
[54:54] was telling them half the time do all
[54:56] this but he had no other choice did he
[55:00] that's what God it was God placed him
[55:02] there he didn't put himself there did he
[55:06] and God had to come straighten it out
[55:08] one day didn't he
[55:10] Hallelujah and that's what it is
[55:12] everybody want to be somebody come on
[55:14] but I believe if God as God straighten
[55:17] it then he'll straighten it out now come
[55:20] on and you wish that that that God
[55:23] wouldn't allow that to happen I mean the
[55:25] Judgment would fall that people
[55:27] everybody would just find their position
[55:29] and place Hallelujah that we can go on
[55:32] in and see the power of God right oh
[55:38] Jesus but we found that and God heard it
[55:41] didn't he come on he came down and and I
[55:44] and I was saying you know God was pretty
[55:46] upset about what they say about Moses he
[55:50] was pretty upset I say he was upset one
[55:53] of the some of the terminology he used
[55:55] when he smoked Mir with Leprosy and all
[55:58] of them I can see like I said Moses
[56:01] being their natural brother
[56:03] right I can see him heart
[56:06] hurting I can see him burden down that
[56:10] oh just cuz that was that was his
[56:13] natural family right but one thing about
[56:16] it God had
[56:17] order come on he he began to tell him he
[56:20] says if any spiritual among you now he
[56:22] wasn't denying that some of them didn't
[56:24] was spiritual but he said I speak to him
[56:26] Vision a dream he said but not so with
[56:28] Moses right come
[56:31] on you ain't Hallelujah he he he began
[56:35] to talk to him that way right but Moses
[56:37] begin to please don't let him don't let
[56:39] him die please don't kill him God right
[56:42] but God something he said it it's kind
[56:45] of like hit me real hard he was saying
[56:47] something about it about Miriam he said
[56:49] it if her father spit in her face
[56:52] wouldn't she be
[56:54] unclean and God I said Lord
[56:57] but he made her go without the camp I
[56:58] says the thing about it is I said God's
[57:01] got order
[57:02] right and and that's why you always
[57:05] teach your the children your children
[57:07] all that to respect the ministry right
[57:10] don't pick at people you see them in
[57:13] don't don't do that I it don't matter if
[57:15] they part of this church or not don't
[57:17] don't pick at preachers don't pick at
[57:18] don't do that you you teach them respect
[57:21] right because God is his order right God
[57:25] don't got no respect the persons that
[57:27] man might even be a whatever he is but
[57:31] you still respect that office don't you
[57:34] come on but I say one thing about it you
[57:37] know they challenge it many times the
[57:41] order of God was challenged wasn't it I
[57:43] a want to be long tonight but many of
[57:45] times God's order was challenged wasn't
[57:47] it his order was was challenged I
[57:50] remember I think it was number 16 how
[57:54] they they in Corridos right Moses was
[57:56] pleading with them pleading with
[58:00] them he says you know I'mma let you know
[58:02] that men don't choose God God choose men
[58:06] come on but today what happens men
[58:09] choose their themselves don't they come
[58:13] on Hallelujah but he says God I'mma show
[58:19] you God chose men God chose them he said
[58:23] I ain't brought myself here but but this
[58:25] was God God's doing right I'm speaking
[58:28] to you in the name of the Lord this is
[58:30] the Lord
[58:31] speaking come on they was Levites and
[58:35] that they had their offices but they
[58:37] wanted to to magnify the gift that God
[58:41] gave them and put it on the platform
[58:43] that God didn't design it for didn't
[58:45] they come
[58:47] on but at what expense did it cost come
[58:51] on what like I said challenging God's
[58:55] order they want to challenge but I I can
[58:57] see Moses praying for him right but God
[59:00] told Moses at one point he says tell
[59:02] everybody separate yourself from them
[59:05] come on you know I've been looking at
[59:08] all of all the Lord been dealing with me
[59:10] with all these things right I says once
[59:13] you when you in God's order God's
[59:15] program it's a beautiful thing ain't it
[59:18] come
[59:19] on when you when you when you're in the
[59:21] program of God it's a beautiful thing
[59:23] right even in your storms you can tell
[59:26] that person all is well Hallelujah in
[59:30] your storm because you know that God is
[59:33] still in control in a storm all is well
[59:36] that's a beautiful thing come on Amen
[59:41] because you you walking in the program
[59:43] of God Amen you just keep holding on you
[59:47] just keep standing you just hold on God
[59:50] is going to show up he promised he would
[59:54] that's his order amen amen come on it's
[59:57] a beautiful thing
[1:00:01] Hallelujah that you can tell somebody
[1:00:04] Hallelujah that my testimony is going to
[1:00:07] be way better than what I my trial that
[1:00:09] I've been through right come on oh
[1:00:13] Jesus come
[1:00:15] on but when you ain't in God's program
[1:00:18] it's a sad thing right is the opposite
[1:00:22] the complete
[1:00:24] opposite but one thing about it you you
[1:00:27] can't you ain't going to make God change
[1:00:31] like that come
[1:00:34] on you ain't going you you ain't going
[1:00:37] to do it
[1:00:39] right in the hidden
[1:00:41] things sometimes the the the outward man
[1:00:45] we can't see the hidden things God can
[1:00:47] see them though right come on
[1:00:51] Hallelujah one thing about it like I
[1:00:53] always say Lord we naked in exposed
[1:00:56] before you

[1:01:16] about to change
[1:01:18] now for the good right but I went and
[1:01:22] got in prayer right after I left
[1:01:24] work I said because God I don't say it
[1:01:27] like that because I know one thing you
[1:01:30] wouldn't fix nothing if it weren't for
[1:01:33] God revealing showing you giving you
[1:01:37] knowledge and that's the truth you don't
[1:01:39] just say that to be humble that's the
[1:01:41] truth come on you let God move his hand
[1:01:46] off of you you see that's what it is
[1:01:48] everybody want to be somebody right
[1:01:50] Ernest coming back tonight everybody
[1:01:52] want to be somebody but the thing about
[1:01:54] it is you know all God don't got no
[1:01:57] respect to persons he do respect
[1:01:59] officers but it's God the whole time
[1:02:01] y'all believe that tonight come on
[1:02:03] that's the truth
[1:02:05] hallelujah I says the the unconscious
[1:02:08] things and I I don't want to be long
[1:02:09] tonight but the unconscious things right
[1:02:13] come on examine yourself examine your
[1:02:16] spirit examine your walk come on God's
[1:02:19] got order you can't break that order
[1:02:22] come on you got to get in line with what
[1:02:24] God what God is doing
[1:02:26] or you'll be left behind come on you got
[1:02:28] to get in line with what's God doing or
[1:02:30] you'll miss out on all the blessings you
[1:02:33] can't do it your way
[1:02:34] Hallelujah even though God give you the
[1:02:37] the ability to choose he put life and
[1:02:40] death before you just like he did them
[1:02:42] and but but he let you know come on you
[1:02:44] can choose whatever you want but you
[1:02:46] choose your own way it won't work out
[1:02:49] choose your own mind and thoughts it
[1:02:51] ain't goingon to work out come on you be
[1:02:54] on a downward spiral and I'm going let
[1:02:56] you keep going until you learn how to
[1:02:58] humble yourself Hallelujah that's what
[1:03:00] he's saying to us tonight
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:11] amen praise the Lord
[1:03:14] amen God has order amen amen praise God
[1:03:19] set in order first apostles then
[1:03:22] prophets and evangelists
[1:03:25] pastors and teachers amen God has order
[1:03:30] amen one thing I I said uh book of Acts
[1:03:34] experience one thing about it the the
[1:03:38] apostles they came together and when it
[1:03:42] was something out of order they came
[1:03:44] together or they needed directions the
[1:03:46] guidance they came together and they
[1:03:48] prayed together and see what the Lord
[1:03:50] would all have the Gentiles to do and
[1:03:54] Apostolic order is to
[1:03:58] understand if we want a book of Acts
[1:04:00] then we got to act like the the five4
[1:04:03] ministry acted in the book of Acts they
[1:04:06] had
[1:04:08] Elders he said ordained Elders in every
[1:04:11] city that means that somebody had to
[1:04:15] ordain the elders in every
[1:04:18] city you know when I was a d Apostle as
[1:04:21] a young
[1:04:22] man I didn't know all about what Apostle
[1:04:26] job was but God sent somebody and sent
[1:04:30] somebody else to ordain me and a couple
[1:04:32] of people to ordain me I didn't know why
[1:04:35] God was sending people to ordain me
[1:04:38] because in the organization I was in I
[1:04:41] was a
[1:04:43] minister but when God sent a prophet and
[1:04:47] told him to ordain me as an apostle I
[1:04:49] said you know to us that was the highest
[1:04:52] calling to be ordained as an apostle and
[1:04:56] I looked at myself I said God you know
[1:04:59] so later on I saw a bishop he came and I
[1:05:04] was his Pastor an elder and I was his
[1:05:07] pastor and then we had another Elder and
[1:05:10] I was his Pastor I said oh Lord and and
[1:05:14] they were looking up to me and
[1:05:16] respecting me as their Pastor I said but
[1:05:18] that was going all against the order of
[1:05:22] the organization and the denomination
[1:05:25] that was going all against that because
[1:05:28] you almost go by
[1:05:30] longevity who been here the longest then
[1:05:33] you next you next you next and you sat
[1:05:36] there the longest get to be the you know
[1:05:38] you is and when the Holy Ghost got to
[1:05:41] hold of
[1:05:43] Paul Peter said he had to listen to Paul
[1:05:46] because why God revealed things to Paul
[1:05:49] that he didn't reveal to the rest of
[1:05:51] them he said Paul spoke some things hard
[1:05:54] to be understood
[1:05:58] and some folks have done stable on Earth
[1:06:01] you know the R against them to their own
[1:06:03] destruction isin that right so by the
[1:06:05] grace of God God will God got order but
[1:06:08] the Holy Ghost set the church in order
[1:06:10] amen and the Bible said he gave some
[1:06:14] Apostles amen not men gave you that but
[1:06:18] you know we are so sided in our
[1:06:20] thinking of did man give you a office of
[1:06:23] this and man made you this and man made
[1:06:25] you that but what God made
[1:06:29] you so God got an order he'll make you
[1:06:32] what he wants you to be you may not even
[1:06:35] understand God or make you what he wants
[1:06:37] you to be but when we make ourselves
[1:06:40] something then we become
[1:06:42] nothing amen and then God Amen he'll
[1:06:47] vindicate he'll vindicate if it's God
[1:06:50] he'll vindicate amen the prophet said if
[1:06:52] it's God he'll bless it amen you want to
[1:06:55] know what you your gift is just or that
[1:06:57] then you see whether or not God bless it
[1:06:59] or
[1:07:01] not amen see it all it's all right to
[1:07:05] have a church full of people but you can
[1:07:07] have a church full of
[1:07:09] devils are you with me but if people
[1:07:12] lives are not getting in one Accord with
[1:07:15] the word then what good is a big crowd
[1:07:17] if they're not going to be in one Accord
[1:07:19] with the
[1:07:20] word you can have the biggest buildings
[1:07:23] you can have the biggest Crow but we
[1:07:25] want people people that love the Lord
[1:07:27] but don't mind praising the Lord don't
[1:07:30] mind giving God what's do
[1:07:33] to you got to have people that's sincere
[1:07:37] about their soul and their
[1:07:39] Destiny people that want to go to heaven
[1:07:41] people that want to see Jesus people
[1:07:43] that love the Lord amen uhhuh you can't
[1:07:46] beg people to love the Lord amen amen
[1:07:49] many
[1:07:51] uh many are called a few chosen
[1:07:55] are you with me praise God I'm so glad
[1:07:58] that it's just a few chosen I'm so glad
[1:08:01] I'm one of them amen so God got to call
[1:08:05] you he got to predestinate
[1:08:08] you if he don't do it
[1:08:11] then you know sometimes we we feel so
[1:08:14] sorry for people oh I feel so sorry I do
[1:08:16] I cry it makes you cry cry for folks and
[1:08:21] cry for people that take makes their
[1:08:23] wrong choices and you cry and you cry
[1:08:27] for people that seem to be rebellious
[1:08:30] and seem to be a they don't listen and
[1:08:34] you you you can't tell them anything and
[1:08:37] and you cry you cry for their soul
[1:08:39] because you don't want their soul to be
[1:08:41] lost because one day they might not
[1:08:44] listen to you but that mean they don't
[1:08:46] listen to God either goad if they don't
[1:08:49] listen to you they ain't going to listen
[1:08:51] to
[1:08:51] God are you with me because if you

[1:20:51] preach to them but they can't be saved
[1:20:54] they total loss only the preaching will

[1:21:01] when he preached to those Souls those
[1:21:03] Souls couldn't come
[1:21:04] [Music]

[1:21:11] who what Noah was telling you
[1:21:14] longsuffering of God waited on the day
[1:21:16] to knowah why the AR was prar weigh in
[1:21:19] few that was eight Souls the prophet

[1:21:24] total
[1:21:25] lost you won't be able to have mercy you

[1:21:37] time where you won't come and I want to
[1:21:40] be baptized you have no desire to change
[1:21:43] you have no desire to live for God have
[1:21:45] no desire to praise him you'll be
[1:21:47] totally

[1:21:52] desire away Mercy runs
[1:21:55] out the Holy Ghost Lift It Off the Earth
[1:21:58] he's LIF lifting gradually that's why
[1:22:01] amen the anointing is lifting
[1:22:04] gradually when people used to climing on
[1:22:06] fire it's lifting God is taking his
[1:22:09] Spirit off the Earth
[1:22:12] gradually so that's why the people are
[1:22:14] having
[1:22:15] entertainment they're having almost like
[1:22:17] an entertainment place people jumping up
[1:22:20] and down and running and just having
[1:22:23] entertainment
[1:22:25] and if you ain't jumping and shaking and
[1:22:28] you know making yourself almost like
[1:22:30] you're
[1:22:33] happy it's an exercise
[1:22:36] class but the spirit of God and the
[1:22:39] power of God and the anointing moving
[1:22:41] and people being delivered no they still
[1:22:43] living like they used to
[1:22:45] live there's no change in their lives
[1:22:49] they just religious now they go to
[1:22:51] church but they don't change they the
[1:22:54] word but they can't change why the
[1:22:57] prophet said there'll be spiritually
[1:23:01] dead spiritually
[1:23:10] dead still living but spiritually
[1:23:12] they're
[1:23:14] dead people still having church but
[1:23:16] spiritually they're
[1:23:18] dead spiritually they're
[1:23:21] blind spiritually they can't see
[1:23:26] why because they don't want the
[1:23:29] word he said I canel the by me assab
[1:23:33] that you might see a't that right but
[1:23:37] they don't want the assab they don't
