the land Lord I printed you help me chat every individual he'll save and deliver bless your word now in Jesus name Amen Genesis for wool familiar Scripture thank God for brother Tate and mashanda thank God for them and so they meant I just want to be accepted this morning I want to hear him say well done good and faithful servant will you be accepted this morning four and three in process of time came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and evil he also bored of the first none of the flop is flawed and of the fact they are and the Lord had respect to Abel and his offering but in to Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why are they wrought and why is that countenance fallen if God do well thou shalt thou not be accepted and if God doeth not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him so by the grace of God and we thank the art for the word you may be seated god is good amen will you be accepted because as I said earlier we want to hear him say well done good and faithful servant enter into this joy of the Lord when it's all over when the work Don has done a man that I heard somebody say to me the work I've done speak for me may the life I live speak for me when it's all over your offering what you've given to God I want to know will God accept what you're giving it because many of times we give God what we think he deserve or what we think we want to give him and I sometimes like I find myself for that I'm not giving God enough that I can really do more than I'm doing for the Lord he's too good to me and he's been too good to me for me to be slack about the things of the Lord sometimes I look at myself and I says certainly I am feeling in the respect that I can give God more than I'm giving I can do more than I'm doing I can pray more than I'm praying I can fire more than I'm fasting in every every area and aspect of my walk with God you know I said to brother Gordon if I complete a good time lucky please and saying like Sean wins and play the socks are like Josh and stuff like I said y'all probably be in church all day and night because I wouldn't stop I mean I probably on the street corner then you know I mean because I know people like somebody that can sing and somebody can play now preaching they may listen a little while but if he is saying do you play an instrument you got a crowd right there somebody bricks god I said I wish I had it could all you would y'all y'all meet in a lot of trouble y'all think only in church for a little while but y'all be in church all day obviously I get caught up but by the grace of God nevertheless we must examine ourselves are we given God all that he deserves for his blessings towards our lives are we given God see Abel had a revelation of what God wanted do you have a revelation of what God is required of you in your spiritual walk do you have a revelation of what God wants in your life and how what he wants you to give back to him because it took a revelation for able to know what God was required of him and it takes a revelation for you and I to really come in contact with God and said God revealed to me the first thing song or Paul wonder we saw on the way to the Masters and when he saw the light and he recognized who are your Lord and lost and I'm Jesus the first thing he said long what would I have me to do I believe God just didn't save us to sit down but God has something that he wants you to do and when I came to Christ as an early Tahoe fellow he met 40 some hard years ago and and I wanted to give him everything on God but I find myself not knowing what my purpose was what can I do for God I can't sing I'm scared to talking for the people what can I do I looked at myself I couldn't do nothing one thing I find myself I found myself in prayer every prior service that I could get in I found myself constantly and praying on my knees and crying not to God because I wanted didn't know what I could do for the Lord and everybody that I could tell about the goodness of the Lord I find myself witnessing for him on the job as a worked in the hospital television and could bring people to church and and let them experience what I've experienced that God has saved me I wanted other people to be saved and then in the purpose of God's gift in your life is just enhancing that you can use that gift to bring one soul to Jesus Christ then you must do everything with what God has given you to win a soul to Christ and your main objective as a Christian is not to live for yourself but to live for others and they do all you can to try to get somebody to Jesus it doesn't matter how you look doing it it's about your motive and your objective and what you're trying to achieve let's use the gift that God has restored upon our lives to win souls to Jesus Christ and not let's not look at ourselves as victims of circumstances in and look at all the things that have before us even that's what's getting in problems he said if God be with us there will be all these miracles amen I want to know it that our fathers told us about I want to know where is it he meant if God is false and then he beheld the Midianites and every time he tried to they planted and they had a harness and the enemy I mean take it away from them and just seemed like every time God bless you the devil come and take it away from you are you up so here guy if God be forced and why is all as miracles even and you look at the stuff this virus and if God before us then where is his miracles hills that no balm in Gilead is that no physician here even if the Lord is on our side did we hire about a God of healing and deliverance but why is it illiterate in my life they men don't count yourself short they men only your revelation would determine your sacrifice your revelation is reflection amen of what you would give to God amen and if you have a real revelation that healing of the blood of cheeks let's just go to Ephesians 1 because many people are so sad and and their part of the way with amen what the hell Pratham distressed is all about but don't be the stress I find myself on my knees thanking the Lord for all his benefits even I thank the Lord and when I start taking along you know you forget about your pains in your body forget about your troubles and your problems amen you begin to thank the Lord because he made the songs of count your blessings count your many blessings can't you see what the Lord has done the Lord has been good to us in spite of what we're going through right now and spite of what we've been through God is still a good God and that God is still the less than of us oh yeah see praise God you go through a little trouble but don't let your trauma scold you to stop praising God amen yes your praise is in your sacrifice we give them sacrifices of praise even you got to continually praise God continually to give sacrifices of praise when you don't feel like you got a praise in but you got to reach down and said I still got a praise I got a praise makes your feet water dancing you want a shot because even Lord is not because my conditions and my troubles of my problems but because of how good you are he's my present help even in the time of trouble I still love you Lord and I offer in your terminada sacrifices of joy I appreciate a priest would things are going good and I praise you and things are going bad I appreciate aha hallelujah oh yes I give God fries hallelujah and the devil some time you test you out will you still praise God in it when everything is falling apart will you still giving praise will you still telling think they can't spider-woman hallelujah don't let your circumstances cause you to be in bondage he meant letting yourself go in feed Amen I'm going by not what I feel and not what I see but I'm going by what I believe halleluyah halleluyah he's not he's not forgotten about you he's not Amen praise God he's not saying Amen forget it even God said I'll never forget you hallelujah still loves you how do you sometimes we think because of our weaknesses just sometimes we stumble and sometimes we fall that God just says oh well I'll let you in it but all you got to do is repent and say Lord Amen I'm sorry god help me and I said he'll restore your back he'll bring you back in fellowship amen we only confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sin Ephesian 1 in 3 it says blessed be God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with what all spiritual blessings do you know it's something he could say I'll give you some spiritual blessings but he says blessed us with what all spiritual blessings so God it's not one blessing that God has not given you amen he's blessed us with all the spiritual blessings oh but if you don't know you have it you never use it if you don't know how blessed you are you'll never appreciate the blessing but you must have a revelation the eyes of your understanding must be enlightening you must be able to look to the unseen and have enough faith to say God thank you for your blessings amen i'm blessed beyond measure amen praise God on the less oh thank god how blessed you are even because sometimes the devil wants a may suppress you will stir cause you to be depressed it cause you to have your head hung down in looking at your problems or looking at your circumstances and stead of looking at how blessed you are yeah I freed Devils a move aim at the enemy I've been put to flight amen hallelujah things are beginning to change in your home things are getting is changing your family children again to get in order once you start looking at your blessings whoa hallelujah Lord why did you let my child be like this why did you let my daughter hell out of wedlock why did you do this Lord why do you do that but God you go whoa hallelujah I'll tell you you bought him lost he meant this and you lost that but you had I hadn't lost my praise amen don't lose your praise he told loss Justin he lost that and they lost a daughter but he didn't lose his fries he's still trusted God he still said God you still good on the whole world even it's time the job to give up but Johnson I'm holding on I'm a hold to God's unchanging hand I serve a real God I serve a God that I know I'm holding on I can't let go of his hand I'll never let go of his hand amen don't let him go o blessed us with all spiritual blessings amen and I thank God for all those spiritual blessings in heavenly places you may not know where you're all but I by revelation God has put you in heavenly places but that must be a revelation to you they meant Cain don't have that revelation but Ava had a revelation what God had required and your position of who you are he meant cause this Amen God ain't meant to have respect to you are you with me God has done something look what he says here he said according as he has what it shows us accordingly he's chosen us in him when that means he meant that you were in it as you were in your great-great-grandfather amen as I was where back in my great-granddaddy before I even knew I was there I mean I was there and I was passed on to my my grandfather did my daddy amen and I got here amen when I in my mother and daddy amen praise God decided to have number eight well I was number eight and I was in the middle of the 15th and God position had placed me in the middle seven older seven younger seven brother seven sisters are you with me but God knew I would be number eight before the word and God saw me in my great-grandfather just like he even had pain tired while he was yet I leave on a map a time when he why he was yet in the lungs of his father Abraham leave all the way back and Eva Hannah loves and didn't even come into existence yet but God said he paid ties why he was yet in the lungs chosen us in him when before when the foundation of the world became an existence God chose us even but you must have a revelation that God chose you if you don't know that then you might be like King amen will I be accepted will your sacrifice be accepted will you be accepted in man but here he says that's calling as he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him how amen if you don't have a love you you're not in hell because God is a law if you got to be mean and hateful in despiteful and jealous and envy and strife he meant but God chose you they meant in him that you should be holy he meant God wants you to be separate from the unholy things they meant separate from and then all the alcohol drinking and all the reef was smoking in the joints in the marijuana God wants you to be holy for your body is a temple of the one Holy Ghost you've got to realize that God didn't call you to uncleanliness but God called you to holiness they meant thank God for holiness amen he chose you in him before the foundation of the world you should be holy and without blame before him in love haven't read estimated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ he meant to himself according to the good pleasure of what his will they meant how do you know what God will is for your life brother and sister God will is his word and we can try to do God a service is not according to his will sometimes but you know what the will of God is for your life it's the word he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you amen you can ask what you will and I do it are you with me now Cain got upset with God because he didn't want to he meant do whatever did never had a revelation of doing what the word will do required oh you and you and I have this Bible here and we know what the word is required well you know some people say well I know what God said but God better take this you know it just is it seem like people think that they can get by on doing it their own way he says here to the praise of the glory of His grace when he has made us accepted all you with me you can't just see how you know you accepted he said he has made us what are you ask the question will you be accepted the Bible said he's made us what in the beloved amen now I want you to understand that God has made you accepted in the beloved amen it's not what you've done but but what he's done for us Levi didn't physically pay ties Abraham physically paid to tithe but Levi appeals are you amen and and God amen it's not what you gave God that God accepted you it's what God gave you in it is whatever ham did that Levi was a beneficiary of what Abraham did and we are benefiting let me show you okay in the seventh verse it says and hole we have reduction see Abel offered up the blood he meant of an animal amen and he was accepted but he said here that at home we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his word it's great they meant grace is God's unmerited favor love towards us in the right that means we didn't deserve it but God gave it to us we we are accepted because of the grace of God are you a man and I said when he has me he has way and he has a bound towards us in all wisdom and what prunes it had been made known unto us to what God will is a mystery the world don't know nothing about it the world knows nothing about it but God has made known to you and I the mystery of his will and I said will you be accepted the mystery of your sentence and the reason God has accepted you because God accepted Abel's sacrifice are you a Cain was denied because of what he offered God it's a lot of people that are working out here for the Lord and they're labeled in the vineyard for the Lord and one day they're gonna come to God amen and they don't say God you know didn't I do many wonderful things in your name pray I heal the sick and Lord I gave to the pole and I went to the prison I did Dustin I did died and one day he gonna say depart for me your work was of iniquity and I don't even know you see because of you trying to do God a service outside of his word then you in travel brother sister friend praise God I you know it's so many beautiful mothers that are preaching the gospel I mean wonderful people loving and kind and just as sweet as they can be but you know they're out of order even a Mother's Day they are out of order even grandmama is our order because without a revelation woman is supposed to be subject to the husband demands you rule over her we ought to be but not in our day not in this generation so I'm saying Amen it's time that we get in order and when we get in order God is gonna bless us when we get in order amen but because men won't take their right position and the women has to go out and work hard and leave a heart and a man set back won't work hard working sisters leaving sweating cooking cleaning taking care of children working hard and a man Lambay run around doing all kind of crazy stuff leaving all the bernam but thank God for a good mother good mother sticking with the children in random but sometimes all by the lonesome because it's a parliament I have a lord she's caring special in this generation yo know how difficult is especially among the women have no choice sometimes when I said brothers Amen if you got a good wife and you got somebody that love and respect you you ought to give up Hana you ought to thank God every day thank you huh blessing me Amen with a good wife they go beyond and above for who can find a virtuous woman her prize is for thank God for versus woman thank God for water labor Oh God I know sometimes I just gotta add a little bit but y'all sisters out you we don't give you enough praise for all you do they said when you get into church who you're gonna see mostly sisters and you act somebody to do something we're gonna jump first oh you want me I'm telling you brothers we gotta thank God for these sisters are you with me thank God for how hard they were amen I proceed I highly ever see anything but I appreciate my wife I always see when they said some bread Simmons you did a good job with your children I said my wife did a good job let me give her that give her that credit because she did a good job and I thank God for amen because I'll tell you if you got somebody to got your back the Brethren says you ought to be thankful for it hallelujah Oh some tears but thank the Lord God is good ain't it almost makes gonna go back and say thank God for my mama amen oh yes she walked the floor she cried in the night praying for us amen but a prize were heard thank the Lord oh you bet you're not forgetting the prize was her it reached heaven it came down to where I was and when I didn't want to serve the Lord I wanted to be like the other young people but God came in God man cuz somebody was praying for me somebody said my mama pray for me amen and I thank God from praying mothers that would pray and they've cried to God on their knees in agony you know I thank God some women think they got they got to do what they doing and I'm saying you know I'm not upset with him he meant but I got an obligation to tell them I appreciate you he meant but when you're out of order you still out of order but I appreciate them amen I don't look down on them I know it's rough this tough and you gotta appreciate they trying to do something they meant to make this world a little better they're trying to do something the community sometimes when the man when we move some of these women are throw in to the love of the roughest places and try to make a difference are you a man but see I'm not I'm responsible for telling them the truth regardless how much I appreciate them I'm still responsible for telling them the truth are you with me I know I love them and I don't try to jump on them amen what I try to tell them God loves you thank you for what you do but you need to let me have certain police's oh you want me when it comes down to you know the pulpit let me have that amen are you with me see sometimes the women can do all the work in the house and they can carry my husband you know you ain't done a thing but cuz she don't love you and appreciate you oh my husband she recognized you to hear but you ain't done a thing and give him the headship you know in it that's what we got to give Christ to headship amen no matter how you lever into this vineya yo label it will not be in vain in the Lord in the right all the glory go to God are you with me brains gone and God realize oh Lord I gotta stop I said I gonna be short today very sure and I can finish next week are you he said the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself God had a purpose and all that he does so all things work together to the good of them that love the Lord to them who are the call amen according to his purpose amen God has a purpose in all that you go through he wants to check out how you're gonna respond how you're gonna deal with what you're faced with God always have a purpose and a plan and God checks you and I out to see what we're gonna do how we we have the circumstances how are we gonna handle this sometimes we act look at a cane look how Hannity was it was a it was rolled the Bobbsey is upset you know sometimes things happen in our lives and folk get upset because of what's going on they get upset with God as though God had done something wrong God and never do you wrong well somebody said well I I was serving God and all of a sudden wasn't such a having from that time I stopped serving the Lord I stopped trusting in God but I'm gonna tell you you know I'm not nothing all to happen in your life that called you not to trust God because at the end of it all amen it'll work - you good if you just wait a while see you've got to wait until God finish with you they meant it's not the beginning amen though that they endure to the end it's a lot of folks at a reason run amen but a lot of they fall by the wayside even but Paul says I finish I'll finish my course I felt a good play oh I did stop you got to keep running so he says the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure now that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work it's what he worked at all things after the what counsel of his own will and that's what it is he worked all things after the counsel of his own will and God will work it out for you and I so body grace of God let God down it and it'll work out to your good let God hound it and you will find out that he knows what he doing and he does all things well let God handle will amen will you be accepted I hope you understand that when the blood was shed at their own Kathryn amen he offered himself without spot to God he meant he went up and he offered up the blood amen often himself through the Eternal Spirit he meant when he offered that sacrifice the Bible said is set down at the right hand he meant to make intercession for us and that because he meant he was accepted amen he was able to come back on the day of Pentecost and send his spirit back on the believer praise God the reason [Music] no condemnation in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh the spirit hallelujah we know you better I beseech at four mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy God which is your reasonable service they matter and be not conformed to this world they made you got to let the world go I wanna let you go something to this world below they made renewed in your mind that you may prove what is the good hallelujah I said good you are because you
