[43:47] always give us what he wanted but what
[43:49] we wanted but he always supplied all our
[43:51] needs hasn't he
[43:52] it's not one time that God has ever
[43:54] failed as he
[43:57] Romans 5 and 1. you got to say Amen
[44:01] and it reads therefore being justified
[44:04] by faith we have what
[44:07] y'all want peace this morning
[44:10] he says being justified by faith you
[44:12] have what
[44:14] don't you thank God for peace this
[44:15] morning
[44:16] come on peace like a real amen
[44:19] somebody said I couldn't sleep last
[44:20] night with a peace of God come on I'll
[44:23] let you go on to sleep won't it come on
[44:25] peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[44:29] Christ you may be seated
[44:31] by whom we also have access by faith
[44:35] into this grace wherein we stand and
[44:38] rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and
[44:42] not only so but we glory in tribulations
[44:45] also knowing that tribulations worketh
[44:48] patience and patience experience and
[44:51] experience hope and hope make him not a
[44:54] shame because the love of God is shed
[44:57] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[44:59] which is given unto us for when we were
[45:02] yet without Strength In Due Time Christ
[45:05] died for the ungodly for scarcely a
[45:08] righteous man will one die but yet
[45:10] prayer Venture for a good man someone
[45:13] even dare to die but God commendeth his
[45:16] love toward us in that while we were yet
[45:19] what
[45:20] sinners Christ died for us much more
[45:24] than being now justified by his blood we
[45:27] shall be saved from the Wrath through
[45:29] him for if we when we were enemies we
[45:32] were reconciled to God by the death of
[45:35] his son much more being reconciled we
[45:38] shall be saved by his life and not only
[45:41] so but we also joy in God through our
[45:44] Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have
[45:46] received the atonement wherefore as by
[45:49] one man enter into the world death by
[45:52] sin and so death passed upon all men for
[45:55] that all have sinned for until the law
[45:58] of sin was until the Law's sin was in
[46:01] the world but sin was not imputed where
[46:03] there is no law nevertheless death
[46:06] reigned from Adam to Moses even over
[46:08] them that had not sinned after the
[46:10] sellitude of Adam's transgression who is
[46:12] the figure of him that was to come but
[46:15] not as offense so also as the free gift
[46:19] forever through the offense of one man a
[46:22] one minute one many be dead much more
[46:25] the grace of God and the gift of by
[46:30] Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ
[46:33] hath abound unto many and not as it was
[46:37] by one that sinned so is the gift for
[46:40] the Judgment was by one to condemnation
[46:43] but the free gift is of many is of many
[46:47] offenses unto justification for if one
[46:50] or by one man's offense death reigned by
[46:53] one much more they which receive
[46:56] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[46:58] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[47:02] Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense
[47:05] of one judgment Came Upon all the to
[47:09] come into condemnation even so by the
[47:13] righteousness of one the free gift came
[47:16] upon all men unto justification of life
[47:19] for by one man Disobedience many were
[47:23] made Sinners so by The Obedience of one
[47:26] shall many be made righteous moreover
[47:29] the law entered
[47:32] enter that the offense might abound but
[47:36] where sin abound Grace did much more
[47:39] about him that is sin hath reigned unto
[47:43] death even so might grace Reign through
[47:46] righteousness unto
[47:49] eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord
[47:52] may God it'll bless you the reading of
[47:53] his word
[47:55] this morning by God's grace that's what
[47:58] I want to talk to you about is Grace
[47:59] this morning amen about Grace you know
[48:03] and I've just been in this area for the
[48:05] last couple of weeks now talking about
[48:08] Grace you know and I know we had been
[48:11] ministering for a while there on on the
[48:13] fall of Man and how man being in this
[48:16] Fallen state but now today I want to
[48:19] talk about Grace after the fall amen and
[48:23] how you know man had fallen yes but God
[48:26] had a plan to get man back to that state
[48:29] or where he had fallen from and that
[48:31] state wouldn't be uh through works or
[48:35] any good that that man can do but that
[48:38] that state I mean that that place that
[48:40] God would get him back to would be only
[48:43] by his grace
[48:44] only by the grace of God you would be
[48:47] able to obtain the things where where
[48:49] God has the blessings that God has for
[48:51] you the only way only way you'll be able
[48:54] to obtain that Perfection or get back to
[48:57] the Tree of Life Hallelujah that Adam
[49:00] and them had got banished from would
[49:02] only be by the grace of God you know
[49:05] when man sinned and man should die right
[49:08] but it's only one way he was going to
[49:10] get back and that was gonna only be by
[49:12] what Grace come on God was going to do
[49:15] something for you that you didn't even
[49:17] deserve
[49:18] that you wasn't even worthy of it and by
[49:21] not by by you were born by by Nature you
[49:26] were what the children of Ralph came out
[49:28] the womb already like it says Born Ready
[49:32] to Die ready to go to the Judgment from
[49:34] the womb right but God by his grace he
[49:38] says I'm going to do something for him
[49:40] Hallelujah that's gonna override the way
[49:43] they were born come on but they got to
[49:44] receive it what I'm talking about and
[49:46] what is it that's that grace of God
[49:48] so that's what Paul kept talking about
[49:51] just here this morning in our reading
[49:53] Paul was talking about the gift of Grace
[49:56] he kept making no note of it when he
[49:58] talked about Grace he didn't say
[50:00] something that you can work towards but
[50:02] he kept saying the gift of Grace come on
[50:04] this is a gift that God has given you
[50:07] you know a gift you can't work for a
[50:09] gift can you somebody says I'm gonna
[50:11] give you this gift but all you got to do
[50:13] is give me ten dollars for it but that
[50:15] ain't no gift then is it you bought it
[50:17] did you come on but a gift is something
[50:20] that somebody given to you freely
[50:22] I know you don't deserve it you ain't
[50:25] you couldn't work hard enough to achieve
[50:27] it you couldn't live good enough to
[50:29] obtain it but I love you so much I'm
[50:32] gonna give it to you anyway Hallelujah
[50:34] and you know the devil don't like that
[50:36] does he
[50:37] he don't like when God just blesses a
[50:41] man because you know he's up there
[50:43] before the throne accusing the brother
[50:44] and all day long ain't he but when God
[50:47] looks down on him he says he don't even
[50:49] see it why because he's looking through
[50:51] them through the eyes of the blood what
[50:54] what the devil want to accuse you of and
[50:56] all these things don't you know that the
[50:58] blood of Jesus already taken care of it
[51:00] it's my grace that's sufficient for him
[51:03] Hallelujah you know what the devil want
[51:06] to do a man find all the time want to
[51:08] give his life to God and in his heart he
[51:11] want to come but what the devil does he
[51:13] likes to hang something over his head
[51:15] don't he remember what you did last
[51:17] night remember what you did the last
[51:19] week and all these things and remember
[51:21] you did this and you did that and if
[51:24] that man don't be mine for the devil or
[51:26] keep them Bound in Chains he come in the
[51:29] house of God and he can't even lift his
[51:31] hands and say thank you because the
[51:33] devil is hanging something over his head
[51:35] but if he would only get a revelation to
[51:38] what the grace of God is that before I
[51:40] even did those things God already knew
[51:43] it when I was dead and trespassing sin
[51:46] in due time when I was without strength
[51:48] Christ died for the ungodly God said me
[51:51] hallelujah oh Jesus come on God is so
[51:56] good this morning you know I'm stirred
[51:58] because I was in that place once where
[52:00] the devil had things hanging over me and
[52:03] I felt like when I come in the house of
[52:05] God and you know the worship was going
[52:07] forth I wanted to lift my hands but I
[52:09] couldn't lift my hands I want to say
[52:11] Amen but I couldn't say Amen because the
[52:13] devil had something over my head but
[52:16] it's something about that little
[52:17] Revelation when it came forth that
[52:19] before you even did those things God
[52:21] already knew you was going to do them
[52:23] and before the foundation of the world
[52:25] God already had you in his mind the lamb
[52:28] was already slain God had already made a
[52:31] way of Escape for you all you got to do
[52:34] is accept what God has done for you Lord
[52:36] I believe it Lord God I'm thankful Lord
[52:39] I'm glad that you died for me Lord
[52:41] hallelujah then you can be free to
[52:44] worship the Living God you know it feels
[52:46] good when you can worship God Amen
[52:49] feels good when you can come in the
[52:51] house of the Lord and lift your hands
[52:52] when you can say thank you Lord
[52:54] hallelujah when you can Testify the
[52:57] goodness of God come on how people can
[53:00] talk about what you're used to doing
[53:01] then you can say but God hallelujah but
[53:05] God who was what rich in Mercy we all
[53:08] walk that way but God who was rich in
[53:10] Mercy in due time when I was walking
[53:12] that way God had a sacrifice already
[53:15] made for me I'm so glad that He Paid a
[53:18] Debt that he didn't know I owe the debt
[53:21] that I couldn't pay but he went the
[53:23] distance from me and he paid the price
[53:25] and I'm so glad that God paid the price
[53:27] that's why I can stand before you today
[53:30] because of the price that was paid for
[53:32] me Hallelujah
[53:34] oh Jesus come on it's only by what the
[53:38] grace of God ain't it come on I like how
[53:40] Paul says I am that I am by the what by
[53:44] the grace of God you know you it's
[53:46] nothing that you can do if you say is
[53:47] that I'm saying I did this and I did
[53:49] that come on then you don't understand
[53:51] what Grace is all about come on you
[53:54] hadn't accepted what he has done for you
[53:56] and that's the problem that the
[53:58] Pharisees had in it because they looked
[54:00] at themselves as being holy they lived
[54:03] but what Jesus when he seen him he said
[54:05] you full of dead men bones and what all
[54:07] the corruption come on they they I was
[54:11] living according to the law come on but
[54:13] the law uh what the only thing the law
[54:16] could do was Judge it right and show you
[54:18] what sin was because without the law
[54:20] they didn't know what sin was so sin
[54:23] came I mean law came to show you what
[54:25] sin was right I was sharing with them
[54:28] last uh Sunday down in Sumter I say the
[54:30] thing is I said let me tell you about
[54:32] what the law does I say is that you can
[54:35] go down to the police station and say I
[54:38] ain't ran a stop sign in 10 years
[54:40] I ain't ran a red light in 10 years I
[54:43] kept the speed limit in the last 20
[54:45] years and they'll probably say well
[54:47] thank you for keeping the law right but
[54:49] you get in your car and leave out that
[54:51] police station and run that first stop
[54:53] sign that police gonna pull you over
[54:56] ain't it come up to your car you say but
[54:59] I ain't ran a stop sign in 10 years
[55:00] right what are you going to tell you
[55:03] well that might be good and I hope y'all
[55:05] running for another 10 years but right
[55:07] now we're going to give you this ticket
[55:09] come on and your insurance you call the
[55:11] insurance company with insurance company
[55:13] gonna say we thank you for not but what
[55:15] we gonna your insurance going up ain't
[55:17] it come on because that's what the law
[55:20] is there to keep you in line right come
[55:22] on but it's something about Jesus Christ
[55:25] when he came on the scene he was going
[55:28] to show them aside of God that they
[55:29] didn't know nothing about a side of God
[55:32] that they hadn't experienced yet and
[55:34] what was that sign of God that side of
[55:36] God was Grace right come on that even
[55:39] though yes you broke the law but Grace
[55:41] is here come on the law has been broken
[55:45] but if you repent Grace is here come on
[55:48] my grace is sufficient for you I know my
[55:52] grace will cover you my grace will watch
[55:54] out for you Hallelujah I thank God for
[55:57] his grace because every day we wake up
[55:59] and we fall don't we but we got to Die
[56:02] daily like the scripture says but I
[56:04] thank God for the grace of God I can
[56:07] shout because of the grace of God I can
[56:09] and dance because of the grace of God
[56:11] that's on my life all the grace
[56:14] Amazing Grace
[56:16] How Sweet the Sound that saved a Wretch
[56:20] like Me
[56:21] hallelujah oh Jesus something about that
[56:24] Grace come on
[56:26] when I talk about Grace after the fall
[56:28] you know but that's what it is they the
[56:30] law could only judge it right but Jesus
[56:32] is going to show them aside aside come
[56:35] on of him that the world didn't know you
[56:38] you know it's something about the
[56:39] Catholic church and how they held the
[56:41] world in fear for over a thousand years
[56:44] showing the world of what an Angry God
[56:46] right in which God a god with eyes of a
[56:50] flame and fire right and all these
[56:51] things but he will be that God one day
[56:53] now come on but as long as there's still
[56:56] Blood On The Mercy Seat come on then you
[56:58] can come before that Throne Hallelujah
[57:01] that judgment seat the only difference
[57:03] between the Judgment seat and The Mercy
[57:04] Seat is the blood Hallelujah as long as
[57:06] the blood is there you can come before
[57:08] it and you gotta Advocate with the
[57:10] father you can come to God and say Lord
[57:12] I'm sorry God forgive me for all of my
[57:14] sins Lord I need your help
[57:17] I'm in bad shape God I need your help
[57:20] today Hallelujah God loves a man like
[57:23] that don't he but one day blood will be
[57:25] taken off of that seat come on but it's
[57:27] the grace come on showing them aside of
[57:30] God aside of God that they hadn't seen
[57:33] before Grace Hallelujah Grace don't you
[57:36] know many people they want to break out
[57:39] they want to give God they want to live
[57:41] live for God but they can't
[57:43] they got chains holding them they want
[57:46] to worship God but they can't they got
[57:47] chains holding them the devil holding
[57:50] things over their life Hallelujah they
[57:52] want to live for God but they can't they
[57:54] got stuff holding them but don't you
[57:56] know that God has already took the keys
[57:59] of death hell in the grave come on God
[58:03] has already set you free
[58:05] a lot of times people sitting in a jail
[58:07] cell but the door is already open
[58:09] God has already set you free he already
[58:12] pardoned you he already took your place
[58:15] all you got to do is get up and walk out
[58:18] of there Hallelujah and serve the Living
[58:20] God hallelujah
[58:22] oh the joy that came to me when I knew
[58:26] that I was free when my savior found me
[58:29] and wrapped his loving arms around me
[58:30] all the joy that came to me hallelujah
[58:34] oh hallelujah it's saying that song God
[58:37] don't deliver me why should I be bound
[58:39] come on but that's what it is the devil
[58:42] got people bound on him
[58:44] you know I look at some things I said
[58:46] that in this life we're talking about
[58:48] Grace after the fall now we know that
[58:51] after the fall what happened man
[58:52] disobeyed God and we don't want to go
[58:54] all into that it'd be take too long but
[58:57] how they disobeyed God In The Garden of
[58:59] heed in it how you know he drove him out
[59:02] of the garden right put chair on the
[59:04] floor that says unless they come and eat
[59:06] from the Tree of Life and live forever
[59:08] right so he ran them out of there but
[59:10] even in all of that God had a way God I
[59:13] mean God had a Plan of Redemption didn't
[59:16] he he had a plan to get him back from
[59:19] that Fallen state so we see that in
[59:21] throughout all the Old Testament those
[59:24] Lambs that were slain come on and the
[59:27] blood of the Lambs and the bulls and
[59:28] goats you know it couldn't take away
[59:30] their sins It could only cover it from
[59:33] year to year but God had a plan didn't
[59:35] he they were only Shadows of types of
[59:37] the what the real lamb that was to come
[59:40] one day and who was that real lamb that
[59:42] real lamb was Jesus Christ you know in
[59:45] the in the old days when they brought
[59:47] that lamb and they took that lamb
[59:49] brought it to the priest and you know he
[59:51] he would take that lamb and hold it and
[59:53] they would take their hands and put
[59:55] their hands on that lamb head and they
[59:57] would take a knife and cut that Lamb's
[59:59] through right and they would take the
[1:00:01] blood from over that lamb and sprinkle
[1:00:03] them back on that person but they would
[1:00:06] let that person know that this lamb
[1:00:08] ain't did nothing wrong Hallelujah this
[1:00:10] lamb is dying because of what you did
[1:00:13] wrong God is accepting this lamb because
[1:00:15] of your sins it's because of your sins
[1:00:17] that this lamb has got to die but God is
[1:00:20] going to set this lamb Hallelujah but
[1:00:23] that was only a shadow of type of the
[1:00:25] real lamb that was to come I see John
[1:00:28] say Behold the Lamb of God who take gone
[1:00:30] to take away the what the sins of the
[1:00:32] whole world it was a lamb that was
[1:00:35] coming that when you lay your hands on
[1:00:37] him Hallelujah it was no longer that he
[1:00:39] would just cover your sins but he would
[1:00:42] take away your sins Hallelujah
[1:00:44] something would happen down on the
[1:00:46] inside
[1:00:47] Hallelujah the life that was in those
[1:00:49] blood and blood of bulls and goats
[1:00:51] couldn't come back home couldn't do
[1:00:54] nothing for you you walked away with
[1:00:56] this being the same person
[1:00:58] having the same conscience but when the
[1:01:01] Lamb of God came Hallelujah and he was
[1:01:04] said the life that was in his blood can
[1:01:07] come back on you and I in the form of
[1:01:10] the Holy Ghost Quicken our bodies we
[1:01:13] don't have to walk out living the same
[1:01:15] way but we can be changed from glory to
[1:01:18] glory we can be new preachers in Christ
[1:01:20] I don't know about you but I said Lord
[1:01:22] give me the change
[1:01:24] Hallelujah sometimes you got to get
[1:01:27] tired of just being a church member just
[1:01:30] coming in and out Sunday after Sunday
[1:01:32] and no change has taken place get out in
[1:01:36] and out Sunday after Sunday and still
[1:01:38] can't defeat the hammerites Hallelujah
[1:01:41] can't defeat the Hittites Hallelujah
[1:01:43] can't defeat your enemy walking in and
[1:01:46] out
[1:01:47] because you fighting the battle on your
[1:01:49] own but don't you know he said the
[1:01:51] battle ain't yours
[1:01:53] but the battle is the Lord's
[1:01:56] how you Overcoming By the blood of the
[1:01:59] Lamb and the word of my testimony I
[1:02:02] ain't wrestling with this devil no more
[1:02:04] I'm giving it to God he's already
[1:02:07] defeated that's Hell In The Grave God
[1:02:10] took my place Hallelujah I'm not
[1:02:13] fighting I'm resting Hallelujah in the
[1:02:16] promise of God
[1:02:18] I'm not fearing I'm rusting I'm trusting
[1:02:21] I'm believing in what God Said
[1:02:23] Hallelujah
[1:02:27] you know we've been through so many
[1:02:29] battles here lately spiritually and
[1:02:32] naturally come on but the thing about it
[1:02:35] is I have more joy in those battles than
[1:02:37] I ever had before
[1:02:38] because the more that the enemy come in
[1:02:41] like that like a flood the more I'm
[1:02:43] learning how to release and give it to
[1:02:44] God
[1:02:45] Hallelujah the more I'm learning that I
[1:02:48] can't do nothing about it anyway but he
[1:02:50] said to come unto me all you that are
[1:02:52] heavily laying with burden and I'm gonna
[1:02:54] give you rest take my yoke upon you and

[1:03:25] hallelujah come on for his grace you
[1:03:28] know it's something that hit my spirit
[1:03:30] the other day I was reading the
[1:03:32] scriptures and just looking at that and
[1:03:34] I believe it was Romans 9 and how you
[1:03:37] know Paul was talking about
[1:03:39] can the clay say to the powder why they
[1:03:42] have Thou made me thus
[1:03:44] come on he is talking about Israel and
[1:03:47] how they went through all of that with
[1:03:49] the in bondage and all these things and
[1:03:52] and how God raised up pharaoh
[1:03:54] he says but God did that that he might
[1:03:57] be able to show his power right his
[1:04:00] power and Earth he said what if God
[1:04:02] hallelujah what if God desired to show
[1:04:05] us power what if God want to want to
[1:04:08] show himself to the world and he desired
[1:04:11] to use you to to show the world that
[1:04:13] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:04:15] forever I started looking at trials and
[1:04:17] situations I said what if God hallelujah
[1:04:20] what if God want to show somebody that
[1:04:23] he's still a Healer and he decided to
[1:04:25] use me for that for that uh uh
[1:04:27] opportunity what if God hallelujah won't
[1:04:30] decide to show somebody he's still a
[1:04:33] deliverer and he decided to use me to
[1:04:35] show the world what if God hallelujah
[1:04:38] decided to show somebody he's still a
[1:04:41] way maker I'm looking at doors shutting
[1:04:44] your face but what if God hallelujah I
[1:04:47] want to be a vessel Hallelujah God I'm
[1:04:50] not going to complain God why have you
[1:04:52] made me thus but I am what I am by the
[1:04:55] grace of God I'll get where I'll get by

[1:05:17] and some things look bad you know this
[1:05:19] life got all kind of twists and turns

[1:06:27] things look bad don't they

[1:06:31] thought about it I was saying what if
[1:06:33] God I thought about that you know you
[1:06:35] look at those forest fires and all burn
[1:06:37] up the whole Forest on it burn it all
[1:06:40] the way up but don't you know out of the
[1:06:42] ashes
[1:06:43] come fertilization
[1:06:45] those ashes they says it's fertilized in
[1:06:49] the ground
[1:06:50] because a new crop didn't really come up
[1:06:52] new trees getting ready to come out come
[1:06:54] on God is getting ready to do something
[1:06:56] new in your life but when the fire is
[1:06:58] burning sometimes it's hard we don't see
[1:07:01] it when the fire is burning sometimes do
[1:07:03] we we don't see what God is doing
[1:07:05] because all we're seeing right now is
[1:07:07] the fire
[1:07:08] but that's why he says you got to look
[1:07:09] up to the heels from with come as your
[1:07:12] help the scriptures got to become real
[1:07:14] to you you got to come to a place in
[1:07:16] your life to where you know who you
[1:07:18] serve that you know that your God is the
[1:07:21] God of all gods that he's the king of
[1:07:23] all Kings and he's the Lord of all Lords
[1:07:26] that he can do anything you got to come
[1:07:28] to the place in your life to where you
[1:07:30] know that my God shall supply all of my
[1:07:33] needs according to his riches and Glory
[1:07:35] you got to come to your place in your
[1:07:37] life the way you know that he is the
[1:07:39] Healer
[1:07:41] he's the deliverer he's a savior you got
[1:07:43] to come to the Reckoning in your life
[1:07:46] that it ain't no storm that'll come
[1:07:48] that'll shake my faith ain't no wind
[1:07:51] that'll blow that'll blow me off course
[1:07:54] Hallelujah why because My Soul Is
[1:07:57] Anchored I know whom I believe
[1:08:00] you know the Bible says in that day they
[1:08:02] that know their God or do exploits of
[1:08:05] faith I ain't talking about somebody
[1:08:07] that doubting their God
[1:08:09] somebody that's running and hiding when
[1:08:12] those storms begin to raging
[1:08:14] when the battle get hot they don't want
[1:08:17] to go out there and fight
[1:08:19] come on but I'm talking about a warrior
[1:08:22] Hallelujah a fighter somebody that knows
[1:08:26] who's their Captain know will God their
[1:08:28] serve know that he can't lose a battle
[1:08:31] know that he's victorious in every
[1:08:33] situation he brought me through this
[1:08:36] Hallelujah and he'll bring me through
[1:08:38] that God is faithful in all things
[1:08:40] though he slay me yet I'll trust him I'm
[1:08:44] Gonna Keep Holding On To God's
[1:08:46] unchanging hand Hallelujah you got to oh
[1:08:50] Jesus come on
[1:08:52] oh Jesus come on Hallelujah I tell you
[1:08:56] what God has been so good to us
[1:08:59] but you know what even in the in that
[1:09:01] you'll say God has been so good to us
[1:09:03] what I've been looking at by the grace
[1:09:05] of God is
[1:09:07] the goodness of God is meted out through
[1:09:10] his grace come on
[1:09:12] God every day I said Lord thank you for
[1:09:15] your grace
[1:09:16] come on could have been dead and gone
[1:09:18] long time ago
[1:09:19] I'll cheer him up my wife my
[1:09:21] mother-in-law last night I said you know
[1:09:23] that car wreck over there and when I got
[1:09:25] in a bad wreck in 2003 that was the eye
[1:09:28] opener for me because what it was I said
[1:09:30] I see grace in that should have been
[1:09:33] dead and gone it's many occasions could
[1:09:35] have been dead and gone come on bullets
[1:09:37] flying all kinds of things should have
[1:09:39] been should have been dead and gone but
[1:09:41] what happened God's grace was covering
[1:09:43] me come on because God knew that one day
[1:09:46] I'd hear his voice
[1:09:48] one day he was calling you the whole
[1:09:50] time but you was trying to blot out that
[1:09:52] voice but God knew that one day you'd
[1:09:55] hear that voice and you say yes Lord
[1:09:57] here I am God I want to serve you God I
[1:10:00] wanna I Wanna Live for you God you reach
[1:10:03] out to him and one day he'd reached back
[1:10:05] down to you because he was waiting on
[1:10:07] you the whole time
[1:10:09] Hallelujah y'all believe that this
[1:10:11] morning come on God is so good I say
[1:10:14] grace come on God what Grace after the
[1:10:16] fall I even after the fall God had a
[1:10:19] plan to get man back what it was the
[1:10:21] Plan of Salvation was true to cross come
[1:10:24] on through the cross of Calvary he was
[1:10:27] going to bridge that Gap and he ain't
[1:10:29] gonna Force you that's one thing about
[1:10:30] God he ain't violent
[1:10:32] he ain't gonna Force you come on but the
[1:10:35] Bible says that whosoever will let them
[1:10:37] what come the drink of the Waters of
[1:10:40] Life freely come on it's a free gift God
[1:10:43] wants to give you something for free but
[1:10:45] you know many times people don't want
[1:10:46] him that's why in The Book of Romans it
[1:10:49] talks about when they knew God they
[1:10:51] didn't want him did they they want a
[1:10:53] creature more than the Creator
[1:10:56] talked about all those things and they
[1:10:58] did all those things they became vain in
[1:11:00] their own imaginations and their foolish
[1:11:02] heart was darkened come on God made a
[1:11:05] way to get out of the shape they were in
[1:11:08] God made a way for you and I we don't
[1:11:11] have to go to hell we don't have to go
[1:11:12] down that road but God made a way for us
[1:11:15] to get back to the tree of life but many
[1:11:18] don't want that way come on why because
[1:11:21] it's a straight and narrow way the Bible
[1:11:23] says straight is the gate and now is the
[1:11:26] way that leads to eternal life come on
[1:11:28] Broad is the way that leads to
[1:11:29] destruction many will go their way but
[1:11:32] not straighten that narrow way many
[1:11:34] times people don't want it they don't
[1:11:36] want to walk that that that walk of
[1:11:38] Holiness that that place to where the
[1:11:41] world is going to reject you that place
[1:11:43] is where the world ain't gonna receive
[1:11:45] you they're gonna laugh at you and pick
[1:11:47] at you because of the stand that you're
[1:11:48] taking Hallelujah but when I think about
[1:11:51] how much they laughed at my savior and
[1:11:53] how much they picked at him how much
[1:11:55] they talk about him but yet he was
[1:11:58] willing to go the distance for you and I
[1:12:00] because he know that if he didn't go
[1:12:02] that route he know that if he didn't
[1:12:04] give his life he know that if his blood
[1:12:06] wasn't shed Hallelujah then I wouldn't
[1:12:09] be saved today that you wouldn't be
[1:12:11] saved today so he was willing to go the
[1:12:13] distance I'll take the reproach
[1:12:16] out that of death I'll take the wrong
[1:12:20] for the right
[1:12:22] come on that they might be saved
[1:12:24] Hallelujah and I love them for today I
[1:12:28] thank God come on it's worth your dying
[1:12:30] it's worth your crying it's worth your
[1:12:32] living it's worth your giving why
[1:12:35] because of what he's done for you this
[1:12:37] morning Hallelujah
[1:12:41] come on God you know I always say oh
[1:12:44] it's still a lot of times that if you
[1:12:46] don't do nothing else he already done
[1:12:48] enough
[1:12:48] and you know I'm meeting that with all
[1:12:50] of my heart it's something how you know
[1:12:53] the grace of God you know the grace of
[1:12:56] God
[1:12:58] is different from from what uh from what
[1:13:00] the world picture
[1:13:02] you know that the grace of God is way
[1:13:04] different from what from what the world
[1:13:06] picture I mean I mean yeah picture it's
[1:13:09] different
[1:13:10] you know the Bible talks about hearing
[1:13:12] the fourth verse how he says here in the
[1:13:16] in the not the fourth verse he says in
[1:13:18] uh
[1:13:19] in the seventh verse no in the sixth
[1:13:22] verse for when we were yet without what
[1:13:25] strength
[1:13:27] in due time Christ died for the ungodly
[1:13:30] for scarcely a righteous man will one
[1:13:32] die yet paraventure for a good man some
[1:13:35] would even dare to die but God commended
[1:13:38] his love toward us that in that while we
[1:13:41] were yet sinners Christ died for us
[1:13:44] come on his grace you can't understand
[1:13:46] the grace of God you know I asked
[1:13:48] somebody not long ago a couple of weeks
[1:13:50] ago I said why don't you want God
[1:13:53] they were calling me because they're
[1:13:54] going through all kind of trouble
[1:13:55] tribulations everything hit and falling
[1:13:58] apart and I've been trying to tell him I
[1:14:00] said you know God is the answer
[1:14:02] Jesus is your answer money can't help
[1:14:04] you right now you already saw that
[1:14:06] situations fall apart I said but God
[1:14:09] doesn't answer I said why don't you want
[1:14:10] God
[1:14:11] all he ever did was heal the sick raise
[1:14:14] the Dead all he ever did was come see
[1:14:17] about you in the Midnight Hour all he
[1:14:19] ever did was give you good lungs to
[1:14:21] breathe all he ever did was give you
[1:14:23] hands and legs to walk all God ever did
[1:14:25] was wake you up in the morning all God
[1:14:27] did was tell his angels to keep him
[1:14:29] around your car so when you riding down
[1:14:31] the highway nothing won't happen to you
[1:14:33] that's all God did come on all God did
[1:14:36] was when the things was getting ready to
[1:14:37] fall apart the devil had plans for your
[1:14:39] life God said I won't let it be so
[1:14:41] that's all God did why don't you want
[1:14:44] God this morning
[1:14:45] why don't you want to save you like that
[1:14:49] why don't you want to serve a God Like
[1:14:51] That
[1:14:51] that's been so good to you
[1:14:54] God has been so good to us
[1:14:57] he didn't have to do it but he did and
[1:15:00] he's still being good to us he's going
[1:15:02] overboard with his goodness Hallelujah
[1:15:05] oh Jesus
[1:15:07] why don't you want him come on what I
[1:15:09] said is that what it is when we were
[1:15:10] without strength right come on uh Christ
[1:15:13] died for us you know let's look at
[1:15:15] Ephesians 2 by the grace of God so I
[1:15:17] don't want to be long this morning Grace
[1:15:19] after the fall come on
[1:15:21] God's grace God's grace is something
[1:15:24] that you can't imagine this morning you
[1:15:26] can't even reckon with it all you can do
[1:15:28] is just be thankful for it
[1:15:31] because many people counted you out long
[1:15:32] time ago
[1:15:34] you know that
[1:15:35] people still count you out now
[1:15:38] but the grace of God
[1:15:40] like Paul said in that Grace and where
[1:15:43] I'm standing
[1:15:44] come on I'm standing in that Grace
[1:15:47] I'm living in that Grace
[1:15:49] I'm walking in it every day
[1:15:52] the grace not only the Grace but the
[1:15:53] favor of God
[1:15:55] sometimes people say I was telling some
[1:15:57] some boys at work the other day I said I
[1:15:59] ain't no Golden Child come on
[1:16:01] not not like that you're not just nobody
[1:16:04] special but what it is is the favor of
[1:16:06] God
[1:16:07] give you favor everywhere you go God
[1:16:10] giving you favor you don't even ask for
[1:16:12] it but God give it to you he said I
[1:16:14] loved you come on I like how the
[1:16:16] scriptures say yeah have I Loved You
[1:16:18] saith the Lord come on he began to talk
[1:16:21] about look at your brother and all them
[1:16:22] and where they are in the scriptures
[1:16:24] talking about Israel and all and he says
[1:16:26] but look at what I've done for you I've
[1:16:27] blessed you I took you up I took you
[1:16:30] took land from people oh oh God they
[1:16:34] built The Vineyards you didn't have to
[1:16:35] build them I took it from him and gave
[1:16:36] it to you God blessed you he said I
[1:16:39] bless you but yet you murmuring about
[1:16:40] these little things
[1:16:42] you you merman about the little things
[1:16:44] in life but don't you see what I've done
[1:16:47] for you come on and don't we find
[1:16:49] ourselves uh like that sometimes being
[1:16:52] discontent
[1:16:53] come on
[1:16:54] we ain't content with what God has
[1:16:56] blessed us with it's always it man he
[1:16:59] want to get more more and more his eyes
[1:17:01] ain't never satisfied come on but it's
[1:17:04] something about Christ he is your
[1:17:05] satisfying portion the Revelation is
[1:17:08] that when you get God you got everything
[1:17:10] he's all that you ever need he's all
[1:17:13] that you ever long for all you ever want
[1:17:15] when you get guard that's that that's
[1:17:16] the end of it all your search and you're
[1:17:19] thirsting you're hungry and he's the
[1:17:21] only one that could quench that
[1:17:23] sometimes we try to quench it with all
[1:17:25] other things but it'll never quench that
[1:17:28] thirst
[1:17:29] it'll never quench that desire
[1:17:31] it'll never give you that happiness it's
[1:17:34] only one thing that can quench that and
[1:17:36] that's God
[1:17:37] and it gets better all the time it don't
[1:17:40] get old with time
[1:17:42] come on it don't get old
[1:17:44] but it gets sweeter and sweeter as the
[1:17:46] day go by
[1:17:47] it gets better Hallelujah why because

[1:18:19] to the course of what
[1:18:21] according to the prince and the power of
[1:18:23] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:18:25] the children of Disobedience among whom
[1:18:28] also we all had our conversation in
[1:18:30] times past and the lust of the flesh
[1:18:33] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and

[1:19:16] to the rescue oh the joy and the
[1:19:19] testimony we have right but let a little
[1:19:21] bit of time go on WE quick to forget
[1:19:23] what God has done for us we quick to
[1:19:26] forget where God how God delivered us
[1:19:28] when we called upon him how God uh uh uh
[1:19:31] uh quickly came you know was at work a
[1:19:34] couple years ago and talking about how
[1:19:36] how um you know everybody had a
[1:19:39] testimony or they was in a place once in
[1:19:41] their life and and something bad tragic
[1:19:43] was happening and how they said Lord if
[1:19:45] you ever get me out of this I won't
[1:19:47] never come back
[1:19:49] everybody on the in the table had that
[1:19:51] testimony and was telling their story
[1:19:53] and we was we were stirred up listening
[1:19:56] to those stories so then after everybody
[1:19:58] got done I said no did you keep did you
[1:20:00] keep that confession
[1:20:02] you know nobody kept the confession
[1:20:05] but you know what I said the thing is
[1:20:07] God knows when you made that confession
[1:20:09] that you wouldn't keep it but you know
[1:20:11] we serve a God that's rich in Mercy
[1:20:13] even though God knew you weren't gonna
[1:20:15] keep it you might have thought you was
[1:20:17] going to keep it but you forgot about
[1:20:18] him a little long way and God knew you'd
[1:20:20] forget but even in that God still
[1:20:23] honored it God still blessed you God
[1:20:24] still kept you now come on didn't he he
[1:20:26] didn't hold it against he still looked
[1:20:28] out for you come on that's the God we
[1:20:31] serve Hallelujah but when you think
[1:20:33] about what the goodness of Jesus and all
[1:20:35] he's done for you that'll make you want
[1:20:38] to repent right there and say Lord I'm
[1:20:40] sorry God get me back take me back to
[1:20:42] that place take me back to that
[1:20:44] confession that I made back to that
[1:20:46] place the way God I promise I'll give
[1:20:48] you my life I give you my all that's
[1:20:51] what I want to do God
[1:20:54] because I'm glad of what you did for me
[1:20:56] I'm glad you saved me I'm glad you
[1:20:59] delivered me I'm glad you kept me
[1:21:01] hallelujah oh Jesus come on
[1:21:05] God got to take us back to that don't
[1:21:08] says but God who was rich in Mercy for
[1:21:11] his great law wherewith he what loved us
[1:21:13] even when we were dead in sins have
[1:21:16] quickened us together
[1:21:18] with Christ by what
[1:21:21] by grace
[1:21:23] come on we're talking about Grace After
[1:21:25] the Fall by Grace right
[1:21:28] so I said are you saved yeah I pay my
[1:21:31] tithes every week
[1:21:32] what I got to do with it
[1:21:34] come on yeah I do this I go to church
[1:21:37] every Sunday the question is are you
[1:21:39] safe
[1:21:40] come on there's a lot of people go to
[1:21:42] church every Sunday who they ain't saved
[1:21:45] there's a lot of people give big
[1:21:46] donations to the church but they're not
[1:21:48] saved come on
[1:21:50] y'all believe that this morning
[1:21:52] come on are you saved come on he says by
[1:21:55] what
[1:21:56] by grace are you saved he says and he
[1:21:59] had raised us up together and made us
[1:22:01] sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:22:03] Christ Jesus that in ages to come he
[1:22:05] might show they see the riches of his
[1:22:07] grace and his kindness toward us through
[1:22:10] Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved
[1:22:13] through faith and that not of yourselves
[1:22:16] it is the gift of God not of Works
[1:22:20] unless any man should boast for we are
[1:22:23] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[1:22:26] unto God unto good works which God hath
[1:22:29] before ordained that we should walk that
[1:22:32] we should walk in them come on I said by
[1:22:34] Grace this morning Grace after the fall
[1:22:37] Paul kept Paul kept uh uh uh pointing
[1:22:40] that out that when you were dead and
[1:22:42] trespassed you were a sin when you were
[1:22:44] no good when you were wretched come on
[1:22:46] I want you to remember that when you
[1:22:48] were that's why Paul one point he was
[1:22:50] telling them if anybody can brag I can
[1:22:52] brag
[1:22:53] he's talking about how he was taught at
[1:22:55] the feeding Amelia come on circumcise
[1:22:57] The Eighth Day of Hebrew or the Hebrew
[1:22:59] Pharisee the first see all these things
[1:23:01] he says but I had to count all that loss
[1:23:03] what does that mean I had to count all
[1:23:04] that none of that didn't mean nothing
[1:23:06] he said I had to forget about all that
[1:23:08] that I might learn the Excellency of
[1:23:10] Christ right because when I came to him
[1:23:13] I realized it wasn't what I could do for
[1:23:15] him but it was what it was accepting
[1:23:17] what he could he already had done for me
[1:23:19] come on and that's what it is it's not
[1:23:22] what you can do for God you got to
[1:23:23] accept what God has already done for you
[1:23:25] come on Lord I want to be in your
[1:23:27] service God I want to do your will well
[1:23:30] the first part of it is accepting what
[1:23:31] he's already done come on not by might
[1:23:34] nor by power but by his Spirit come on
[1:23:37] his blood that was shed on Calvary y'all
[1:23:39] believe that this morning come on it's
[1:23:41] by Grace all you say through faith not a
[1:23:44] Works unless any man should boast don't
[1:23:46] you know when Jesus came on the scene I
[1:23:50] closed this morning but when Jesus came
[1:23:52] on the scene and John baptized him you
[1:23:54] know him coming up out of the water what
[1:23:56] did John see John called him the Lamb of
[1:23:59] God didn't he come on who come to take
[1:24:01] away the sins of the whole world John
[1:24:03] saw Grace on two feet walking Hallelujah

[1:24:11] healing yes that's when they all sinning
[1:24:13] coming to get baptized and all these
[1:24:15] things he says but here go Grace

[1:24:22] grace that's come to us now Hallelujah

[1:24:38] I'm glad that Grace came you know when
[1:24:42] they brought that woman that was caught
[1:24:43] in the act of Jesus they said didn't the
[1:24:46] law say this but they didn't know about
[1:24:48] Grace Hallelujah when they brought him
[1:24:50] to him that woman throwed it down and
[1:24:52] say what shall we do the law say kill
[1:24:54] her right
[1:24:55] but Grace what did Grace do Grace says
[1:24:59] that any among you without sin Let Them
[1:25:01] cast the first stone Hallelujah nobody
[1:25:04] could judge that woman but he said go
[1:25:07] and don't do it no more Hallelujah Grace

[1:34:39] a lot of chaos sometimes because you
[1:34:42] have somebody in front office atheist or
[1:34:44] somebody over here this and that and
[1:34:45] then it causes a whole bunch of trouble
[1:34:47] so sometimes you just be riding the work
[1:34:49] job praying you know but you got to live
[1:34:51] the life no matter what you got to live
[1:34:53] life further the gospel but I says that
[1:34:56] God knows you know Kindred Spirits God

[1:35:13] I said the grace of God come on you
[1:35:16] gotta you know just something how I
[1:35:19] wanted I had several scriptures to go
[1:35:20] through and sometimes hard on you just
[1:35:23] preaching to stop and just go through
[1:35:24] all those scriptures but I say it's what
[1:35:27] it is the grace of God is covering us
[1:35:30] you know I was praying one day and I
[1:35:31] could see the devil shooting all kinds
[1:35:34] of things darts at us in our way but I
[1:35:36] says the grace of God is like a blanket
[1:35:38] they're catching them every time
[1:35:40] catching it I said God's grace a lot of
[1:35:42] times the Lord is showing me the devil
[1:35:44] got plans for you and you don't even
[1:35:46] know it but the grace of God Is Watching
[1:35:49] Over You the grace of God is keep you
[1:35:51] but in that by and by in that day you'll
[1:35:53] see just then how much God was keeping
[1:35:56] you sometimes you go in this life
[1:35:58] thinking you're doing things on your own
[1:35:59] you got it you're on you're grown like
[1:36:01] sometimes I'm grown I can do I go but
[1:36:04] you'll realize one day that it was never
[1:36:06] your working
[1:36:08] it was never your strength
[1:36:10] but it was God the whole time
[1:36:12] watching over you keeping you
[1:36:15] he kept the Breath of Life in you
[1:36:17] because he could take it away at any
[1:36:19] time
[1:36:20] he could take things away from you
[1:36:22] anytime he won't can he and without an
[1:36:24] explanation
[1:36:25] but the grace of God Is Watching Over Us

[1:36:29] that Grace
