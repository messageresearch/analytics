[30:13] God is good amen
[30:20] somehow I feel like
[30:24] we don't have the joy that do
[30:28] that we need to have as Christians
[30:32] because that's where our strength is
[30:35] Nehemiah said the joy the Lord is our
[30:38] strength
[30:39] praise God
[30:42] and we got to find ourselves able to
[30:45] press over what all we've been through
[30:47] and all we're going through
[30:48] to realize that Lord I Thank you for
[30:52] what you've given me
[30:54] and Lord I appreciate what I have
[30:58] because someone somewhere don't have
[31:01] what we have
[31:03] and they wish they could
[31:06] but thank God the God has blessed you
[31:08] with what you have
[31:10] and just be grateful this morning for
[31:12] what God has given you now
[31:15] Revelation 5 and 1 it says
[31:18] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[31:21] set up on the throne a book written
[31:25] within and on the backside seal with
[31:29] Seven Seals too
[31:39] and no man in Heaven Nor in Irv neither
[31:44] under the Earth was able to open the
[31:46] book needle to look their own for
[31:58] and one of the elders said unto me we've
[32:02] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[32:04] Judah
[32:05] the root of David
[32:09] has prevailed to open the book and to
[32:13] loose the Seven Seals there of six
[32:35] and he came and took the book out of the
[32:40] right hand of him that set it on the
[32:43] throne eight
[32:59] together and they sung a new song saying
[33:03] thou worthy to take the book in the open
[33:07] seals thereof and thou slain and
[33:11] redeemed us
[33:13] by the blood out of every kindreds
[33:16] tongues and people and Nations God bless
[33:20] the Remus word
[33:22] amen
[33:25] the prophet of God was talking about the
[33:28] book of redemption
[33:30] amen
[33:32] and we know that the Bible
[33:34] has the the plan of God it tells us
[33:38] where we come from
[33:40] it tells us
[33:42] amen while we're here
[33:46] and it tells us where we're going
[33:50] amen
[33:54] to see the difference in the Bible
[33:57] than the other books
[33:59] all of them had prophets and great
[34:02] people but the Bible
[34:05] Jesus Christ was not just your Prophet
[34:08] but he was the son of God
[34:12] but he died
[34:15] everybody else is left with the grave
[34:18] but Jesus died and he rose up out of the
[34:21] grave
[34:24] are you with me
[34:27] and you will tokens and you the evidence
[34:29] proof that he rose
[34:32] why because the same life that was in
[34:35] him
[34:37] when you accept him that life
[34:40] comes down in you and I as believe us
[34:44] and because of his life and because of
[34:47] his dying
[34:51] the penalty was paid now I want to talk
[34:53] about the book of redemption the book of
[34:56] redemption you might say what is the
[34:58] book of redemption
[35:00] this
[35:02] is the title deed
[35:06] this is the title deed it's the abstract
[35:08] title deed
[35:11] you say abstract
[35:13] what does an abstract means it mean it's
[35:17] search all the way back
[35:21] to its beginning
[35:24] are you with me
[35:27] set you all the way back to the
[35:29] beginning it's just like a little drop
[35:31] of ink
[35:34] The Struck in Bleach
[35:37] when it's always back
[35:40] and when
[35:42] sin has been confessed
[35:46] and fallen in to the blood of Jesus
[35:49] Christ
[35:52] oh my it gives an abstract
[35:56] right back to the Creator again
[36:01] and you become sons of God Amen
[36:04] the abstract title deed is held in the
[36:09] hand of
[36:11] the Almighty
[36:16] amen it's Redemption
[36:18] it means all legal possessions
[36:22] to all that was lost
[36:25] by Adam and Eve
[36:28] are y'all with me
[36:30] all legal possessions that was lost by
[36:34] Adam and Eve
[36:35] sometimes it's the understanding of a
[36:38] Christian Christians doesn't they don't
[36:41] understand their legal rights and what
[36:43] it means to be a Christian
[36:44] that's why you focuses you don't
[36:47] understand the need or the warrant or
[36:50] the desire to be a Christian
[36:52] and then some that say I'm a Christian
[36:56] but does not they don't understand the
[36:59] legal rights
[37:01] and what it means to be a Christian
[37:02] sometimes it
[37:04] a Christian it means I don't drink no
[37:07] more I don't smoke no more and I maybe I
[37:10] stop lying but it means more much more
[37:12] than that it goes far beyond drinking
[37:16] smoking and
[37:18] cursing and lying and stealing it goes
[37:21] beyond that
[37:22] you know sometimes they say well you
[37:25] know
[37:28] it it sometimes Christian folk seem like
[37:32] they're missing out on the world
[37:36] so many things that I can experience and
[37:38] I can do
[37:40] and so evidently most young people it's
[37:43] not appealing to you
[37:46] there's nothing that I would like to be
[37:48] because
[37:49] it takes away all my joy and all my
[37:51] foreign of life it just it looked like
[37:55] it's sad who would want to be something
[37:58] that looks so
[37:59] look so dull and so boring and so
[38:04] I want to be that because what they see
[38:06] is
[38:08] you know the desire the nature that's in
[38:12] us that we were born with
[38:14] they just don't gravitate it it's not
[38:17] just not a graph we don't gravitate to
[38:19] to the things of God because our nature
[38:23] well we were born in sin shaping
[38:26] iniquity our desires and was to do the
[38:30] things of our flesh
[38:32] the things of the world
[38:35] because what happened Adam our
[38:39] and Eve fell to sin
[38:42] and they lost their inheritance
[38:44] what were they were their inheritance
[38:46] they inherited the Earth
[38:49] they had it they had Dominion everything
[38:51] going to them
[38:53] but because of sin they lost their
[38:55] inheritance
[38:57] and it went back into the hand of the
[39:00] original owner
[39:03] Satan could not get it
[39:07] but Satan because
[39:10] of his deception
[39:14] he claims
[39:16] the Earth
[39:19] are you with me
[39:20] so he claims to have dominion over you
[39:25] are you with me but he could not get
[39:27] that abstract kind of deed
[39:31] are you with me
[39:33] it wasn't rightful of his and he cannot
[39:36] get it it was Adam's indeed
[39:37] God gave it to them
[39:42] and we know that God put a chair of them
[39:44] before the garden that they could not go
[39:47] eat of the tree of life and live forever
[39:50] are you with me
[39:52] so man could not get back to the Tree of
[39:55] Life
[39:56] there was no way it was a blockage
[39:59] God Blocked that
[40:02] So Adam and Eve ate of the tree of
[40:05] knowledge and good and evil and when
[40:07] they ate up the tree of knowledge and
[40:08] good and evil we find that everybody
[40:10] that was born was born in sin shaping
[40:13] and iniquity
[40:14] because of what had done what was done
[40:17] are you okay
[40:19] so everybody that was born of a woman
[40:23] amen
[40:25] was born in sin shaping their nicotine
[40:27] but Jesus Christ was born
[40:31] by a virgin
[40:33] are you with me
[40:35] a woman that does not have a seed had a
[40:38] seed
[40:40] and that seed was Christ
[40:43] are you with me
[40:45] Jesus did
[40:48] it looked like with man The Impossible
[40:51] but the word of God had prophesied and
[40:54] said the Divergence shall conceived
[40:57] and shall have a son
[41:00] and have a child amen
[41:03] and a virgin did but the world
[41:05] simply because we were born in America
[41:08] we just take it for granted that we
[41:10] believe it
[41:14] we believe it because we go to church
[41:16] and that's all we heard all of our lives
[41:18] but do we really believe it
[41:23] why was it important that a virgin
[41:27] have a child
[41:29] we needed a Kinsmen Redeemer we needed
[41:32] somebody to bring us back to God
[41:36] and John looked and there was no man
[41:38] could take the book no man could look
[41:40] their own if nobody could get this book
[41:45] they couldn't even look on it they
[41:47] couldn't read it they couldn't look on
[41:48] it but nothing
[41:53] so the Bible itself
[41:57] is that book
[42:00] that was sealed up with Seven Seals
[42:04] now we notice
[42:06] that
[42:08] the book was sealed
[42:10] in Revelation 10 1
[42:14] let's look there for a minute
[42:17] I'm talking to you because I want you to
[42:20] understand your redempted rights
[42:25] now I said it was the abstract title
[42:27] deed
[42:28] to the Earth
[42:32] God when he made man he didn't make him
[42:34] in heaven
[42:36] he made man
[42:39] here on the earth isn't that right
[42:42] and he gave him dominion over the what
[42:44] heaven
[42:45] no the Earth
[42:48] are you with me
[42:50] we want to go to heaven right I want to
[42:53] go to heaven when I die
[42:55] amen we can go to heaven but that's not
[42:58] our Dominion that's not what God gave us
[43:03] are you with me he gave us dominion over
[43:05] the Earth
[43:07] that's why John said I saw a new Heaven
[43:09] A New Earth come down from God out of
[43:11] heaven
[43:12] are you with me
[43:14] why the Earth is being purified and
[43:16] burnt with fire amen then we're in
[43:19] heaven for the marriage supper of the
[43:21] Lamb are you with me
[43:23] without until this is cleaned up all
[43:27] these demon powers and all of that
[43:29] has to are you with me then we come back
[43:33] to dwell here
[43:36] are you with me
[43:38] y'all with me
[43:41] Revelation 10 1 it says the book that
[43:44] was sealed he said and I saw another a
[43:47] mighty Angel come down from heaven
[43:50] clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was
[43:52] upon his head
[43:54] and his face was as it were the son
[44:00] and his feet and Spilled the fire and he
[44:03] had in his hand a what
[44:06] a little book what
[44:08] now in Revelation 5 the book was what
[44:12] it was closed
[44:15] it was sealed amen
[44:17] but in Revelation 10 is open it must be
[44:20] a time period
[44:22] when the sealed book becomes an open
[44:24] book
[44:25] are you with me
[44:28] so what was God
[44:30] if we would have known
[44:33] the Rapture wasn't going to take place
[44:35] in the days of Paul and apostles in 2000
[44:39] in every uh period of History uh the
[44:43] Christians was looking for Jesus to come
[44:45] back and take the church in the rapture
[44:48] take us to heaven and and that you know
[44:52] the disciples they knew that
[44:56] God there was a kingdom to come he said
[44:58] pray thy kingdom come thy will be done
[45:01] pray that God would you know restore the
[45:04] kingdom to Israel praying you know there
[45:07] was an expectation they were looking
[45:09] forward to something
[45:12] to lay whole to claim job even when when
[45:16] his Crest when all he was going through
[45:18] he said I know that my redeemer lived
[45:22] and then he talks about it and I shall
[45:24] stand upon the Earth in the latter day
[45:27] are you with me so it was a looking
[45:30] forward to the Redeemer to come and
[45:34] redeem mankind
[45:36] are you with me
[45:38] so it was always in the heart of man
[45:41] that the Messiah the Jews said the
[45:44] Messiah would come
[45:46] and when the Messiah come he gonna do
[45:49] something he's going to liberate us
[45:52] when we talk about Redemption and we
[45:55] talk about being redeemed what is it
[45:57] it's it free us from guilt and the power
[45:59] of sin
[46:02] to free you from guilt
[46:05] and the power of sin
[46:08] are you a man
[46:10] because when you hold your head down to
[46:12] all that you've done a lot of times the
[46:14] reason why folks amen do the things they
[46:17] do because of guilt
[46:20] somewhere in the back of their mind they
[46:23] meant the devil will oppress you he'll
[46:26] put you in bondage because you feel
[46:29] guilty
[46:30] sometimes we're guilty in the life that
[46:33] we live we made so many uh uh mistakes
[46:37] and so many things that it hurts within
[46:40] us in us why did I do this and why did I
[46:44] do that and it hurts so we're real pain
[46:47] and in the inside it sometimes the pain
[46:50] is uh uh uh we we don't come in contact
[46:53] with it because it's psychological pain
[46:57] it's a mental pain it's mental illness
[47:00] it's not a physical sickness the pain
[47:03] that comes in the rims of the spirit it
[47:06] it makes your soul sink
[47:10] it makes the heart ache
[47:13] see sometimes physical physical sickness
[47:16] and and mental sickness come from sin's
[47:19] sake
[47:21] or you have been so uh well
[47:25] it's many things that cause us they
[47:28] meant sin bought about attributes and
[47:31] those attributes of sin those out there
[47:33] [ __ ] was death because Africans to
[47:36] sorrow amen so sin
[47:40] without sin we would have no sickness we
[47:43] would have no death we'll have no pain
[47:46] we have no sorrow
[47:49] Adam did not know what it means Amen to
[47:52] be sick so Amen to have sorrow to have
[47:56] pain amen Eve didn't know nothing about
[47:59] that they just had life
[48:01] eternal life
[48:05] so they didn't know nothing about that
[48:08] but when they disobeyed God
[48:11] then all of that began to occur
[48:14] now in the book of redemption
[48:17] that he had in his hand
[48:19] we said Redemption is in two parts
[48:23] one part he died on the cross shedded
[48:27] his blood that he might
[48:30] pay the ransom and the penalty for our
[48:33] sins
[48:35] are you with me
[48:36] he raps in us he paid the penalty
[48:40] when he died and shedded his blood he
[48:43] ransons us amen because there was a
[48:47] Rants and there was a price that uh we
[48:50] had to pay for sin and nobody could pay
[48:53] that price
[48:57] of The Sinner to get the book
[49:00] of redemption to nobody can look down
[49:04] nobody was worried to get it
[49:07] no man could get it no angel could get
[49:10] it because it'd have to be a Kinsmen
[49:13] can't even Redeemer
[49:16] are you with me
[49:18] and so brothers and sisters it doesn't
[49:20] matter how many tears were crying
[49:23] John said I wept because there was
[49:26] nobody waiting
[49:28] and brother and sister if amen the lamb
[49:32] did not come forth amen and take the
[49:35] book we couldn't be redeemed
[49:39] it was because the Lamb of God John said
[49:43] the comet to take away the sins of the
[49:46] world
[49:48] and they didn't just come to take our
[49:50] sins away but he come Amen to do the
[49:55] redempted work to bring us back to our
[49:58] inheritance
[50:01] to what Adam and Eve lost our
[50:04] inheritance
[50:07] are you with me
[50:08] we weren't supposed to be shooting and
[50:11] killing and robbing and stealing and
[50:13] doing all of this stuff
[50:16] on drugs and you know doing all kind of
[50:20] uh uh stuff that we but we were in
[50:23] bondage
[50:25] bondage with amen by sin and by the
[50:28] devil amen we need Deliverance
[50:32] and Redemption speaks of deliverance
[50:35] from bondage
[50:37] so he comes to deliver us to get us out
[50:40] of that bondage that we could be
[50:43] delivered we can be set free
[50:46] we don't have to be a victim anymore in
[50:50] it for what we were born into sin
[50:54] amen we didn't do nothing but we were
[50:57] born that way
[50:59] amen and I was saying brother we
[51:02] couldn't do nothing to help ourselves
[51:04] and to get out of that condition
[51:08] but amen one that was worth it was the
[51:12] Lamb of God
[51:14] he said Thou Are Worthy
[51:18] we song that song Lord you wagy
[51:23] you're where did they take the book
[51:26] Hallelujah

[51:43] amen but thank God because he was Worthy
[51:48] Hallelujah I'm so glad he was Worthy
[51:51] praise God took my place in your place
[51:55] amen he saw us in our bondage he saw us
[51:58] in our corruption
[52:00] amen because amen we were corrupt and we
[52:04] were sinful by Nature even all of sin
[52:08] and come short of the glory of God
[52:11] but God wanted to restore our Glory by
[52:15] Hallelujah
[52:17] when he made man he said man amen he
[52:20] looked out of me he made him in his own
[52:22] image in his own likeness in God Amen
[52:25] saw everything that was good
[52:28] amen I wonder if he looked at you today
[52:30] what he said oh it's good
[52:33] amen but if he looks at you through the
[52:35] blood he'll see that you justify you're
[52:39] Sanctified you delivered you're set free
[52:43] praise God I look at the Son of God of
[52:46] God because I'm looking at you through

[52:49] of Jesus
[52:51] and I've sent to his blood amen it goes

[53:14] deception and
[53:18] stuff that we were in bondage we
[53:21] couldn't help ourselves we had to do it

[53:27] victims of circumstances
[53:30] Bound By Nature the nature of our
[53:33] fathers our mothers and the nature of
[53:35] Adam and Eve and a fallen nature a
[53:40] sinful nature we were corrupt by Nature
[53:43] amen but God brought about a way through
[53:47] the blood of Jesus that we can have
[53:49] God's nature the divine nature of God
[53:53] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:56] oh God wanted to restore wanted to bring
[53:59] you back

[54:26] victory over the devil
