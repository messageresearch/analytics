Lord, you gave us two legs to walk, two hands to clap, and Lord, a mouth to open to give you all the honor and the glory and the praise. Lord, we thank you for your anointing. Lord, you said when two or three are gathered in my name, there you would be in our midst, Lord. Lord, we ask that you come down, Lord, and move us out of the way that you may get all the glory, all the honor, the praise, Lord. Lord, meet all the needs, Lord. You know what's on every heart, Lord. Go and touch those that are here and those that are not here. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, turn to a familiar scripture. We're going to go to Exodus chapter [Music] Exodus chapter 14, man. How many glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight? Amen. Amen. If I think it's correctly, we're going to start in verse 10. But let me turn to it. Exodus 14 and we'll start in the 10th verse. And it reads when you got it. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it reads, "And Pharaoh drew nigh. The children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. And they were so afraid. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord. And they said unto Moses, because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore hast thou dwelt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, "Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians, for it have it have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness." And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye not. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you today. For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall not ye shall see them again no more forever. The Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace." Amen. God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. Tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled fear not. Fear not. And I a subtopic that I have tonight is God has given us the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has given us the victory. And I wanted to read this because I was reminded of this story when everything looked against the children of Israel. God had done a mighty work to this point and he had brought them out of the He had brought them out of Egypt. But the story wasn't over. The journey wasn't over. And many times when God does something great for us, we think that we have arrived. We have come to a status in God that we can just expect a roll in victory for forever. But that's not how it works. Because sometimes God is still trying to mold you and work on you to elevate you to go higher. See it the coming out of Egypt wasn't the promised land. He didn't want them to stop there. So he had to send test and trial to make them move and get them out of their comfort zone. And sometimes that's what God will do in our lives is he'll send something in our lives to move us out of our comfort zone. Because sometimes we get settled in where we are. We get settled in what we're doing. We get satisfied with where we are. I got this job. I'm making this money. But sometimes God will let you get laid off to give you a better job. Amen. &gt;&gt; He allowed God to double your salary than the salary that you had before. But only through after the test and the trial that you saw what God could do. &gt;&gt; Only through the test and the trial that you had to realize that you couldn't be afraid of what was going to come next. You couldn't be afraid of how the journey was going to end. You just had to trust God. &gt;&gt; And see, when you understand that God has given you the victory, you don't have to be afraid. You don't have to you don't have to worry about it. You said, "Lord, I give it to you." And that settles it. &gt;&gt; See, see Moses, he was going back to God and said, "Lord, they they coming back to complaining with me, but Lord, you sent me here. Lord, you sent me to deliver them out of Egypt. So, you got to complete the work. I don't know how you going to do it. I don't know what you're going to do, but I know that you're going to do it. You wouldn't have brought them this far if you wasn't going to lead them all the way. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have took them this far if you wasn't going to take them all the way in." &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes we get we we we lose sight of where the goal is. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we lose sight that there's a promised land that we that was given to us. There's a promised land that we have to go to. But this is just a part of the journey. &gt;&gt; And when you own this journey, sometimes the journey get rough and you can only see the trial that's right in front of you. &gt;&gt; They done forgot about all the wonderful riches and all the things that was in the promised land cuz all they could see was Pharaoh army. And sometimes we got to just stop looking back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Pharaoh army was behind them. But guess what was between them and Pharaoh's army was the angel of the Lord and the pillar of cloud. &gt;&gt; See, there was something that was standing between them and the enemy that was trying to get them. But if you so worried looking back, you'll never see the progress that God is trying to take you forward. You'll never understand that God has parted the Red Sea. Eventually, they had to turn around to see the salvation of the Lord. They had to turn around and see, you know what? There's a path that leads right on out of my situation. There's a path that God has made that I wouldn't have understood unless I had seen it with my own eyes. I wouldn't have understood unless God has showed it to me. And it might not have seen to anybody else. He said, "Moses, you speak." He told Moses to speak because it there was power in what he had to say. Because he had the authority of heaven back in what he had to say. It wasn't what he had to say, but he was trusting in God that what he spoke would come to pass. He was trusting in God that what he spoke, God was going to move in this situation and he was going to deliver them. &gt;&gt; And many of times we have to be careful what we speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said life and death is in the power of the tongue. &gt;&gt; And it said out of the heart the mouth speaketh. So sometimes you got to see what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Cuz some things won't come out of you unless they inside of you. And some things God will take you through a situation to show you what's inside of you. What's inside of you. And you can't be afraid. Cuz if God is showing you, he's showing you that there's some more that I got to clean up. There's some more I got to take out of you. There's some more. There's a deeper walk that I want to take you to. There's a closer walk that I want to bring you to because in my presence, there's no evil thing. &gt;&gt; When you get in the presence of God, you realize there's certain things you can't do. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get in the presence of God, there's certain things you can't say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not that you don't want to say, you can't say them. You can't. The God has done brightened your tongue that you can't say those things. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we might get afraid and say, "Lord, I want you to be with me." But I would stop you from doing a lot of things. Cuz when God is with you, you can't go certain places. &gt;&gt; You can't be in certain atmospheres. You can't have certain conversations because God is right there with you. Not only that, God has stopped others around you from having those conversations with you because they can't do it. They don't even understand why they couldn't do it. They can they cannot talk to you and turn their back to you and have this the conversation that they want to have right next to the next person. Why? Cuz God was with you. God was right there. See, he had to get them to a point that they couldn't be afraid. They couldn't be afraid that that what God was going to do because he was going to deliver them out of them all. He spoke to Moses. He said, "This enemy that you see today, you'll never see him again." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, when he said, "You'll never see it again." That was the end of the empire in history. &gt;&gt; God deleted them out of the rest of history. He said, "That's the end." &gt;&gt; That's what God does when he when he takes care of your enemies, he does it in such a way that you don't have to worry about it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, that's what God wants you to step out in faith and take with his word. And don't be afraid. Don't be afraid that God has got you in the place that he's got you, cuz he's got you there for a reason. &gt;&gt; He's got you there because he's taking you somewhere else. This is just a stop. It's not the end of your journey. So, you can't get bogged down and let the devil keep you down in the space that you're in cuz God is trying to take you somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, he said he was talking he was talking about this story and he said he said he said now they had come out through and got and notice the blood redemption brought them out of Egypt. Now they had to have something else now to take them on over into the land. Now they just beginning to start. They had just come out, been circumcised, come under the blood and on and on the march. Now they got up to something. They were going along there knowing that they had passed from death unto life, knowing they had eternal life. But they here they are coming up now and difficult begins and difficult begins to rise. Here comes fable. Pharaoh's army pursuing them to take them. Trouble sets in. See, many of times we get to a point in God that we'll have this happen and God delivers us and we have this happen, but the devil don't stop. I was telling someone that this is something happened to me and I said and I and I and then I something and then I started having a few bad days and because that happens to you if you live life long enough, you're going to have a few bad days. And so I had a few rough days and I said I went back and told him I said I should have known the devil was coming because the days before that was real real good days. And I said I should have known the devil was coming. I should have been aware that the enemy was coming to fight me. I should have been aware that the enemy was coming. He was right on. He was seeing what God was doing. He was like God, can I go? Can I go? And not only that, you have to be aware that when things are going good, the enemy is still right there cuz he's seeing the hedge that God is putting around you &gt;&gt; and say, and God is going to allow him to test you. &gt;&gt; He going to allow him to try you. He going to allow him to say, "Hey, hey, are you going to fall or you not going to fall?" I said, "I should have known the devil was coming." Cuz some and sometimes in those moments, you forget all about the victory. You forget all about what God just brought you through. You you you you don't see that no more cuz you in that moment. And the moment is a is a sorrowful moment. Sometimes it's a heavy moment. Sometimes it's a depressed moment. Sometimes an anxiety moment. It's many moments that you might be in. But when God deliver you, he deliver you from them all. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now listen, God is our refuge and our strength, a very present help in the time of trouble." Oh, I hope you see that. See that? And he said, he said, "And Moses said unto the people," I love that that Jesus rose from the dead and his words was constantly, "Fear not." All throughout the Bible, you will see where no matter when the situation, whenever God shows up on the scene, he always said, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; Whenever he sent an angel, he said, "Fear not." There has to be something there because he doesn't want you to be afraid of his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to be afraid of him showing up on the scene. He doesn't want you to be afraid that what you asked for, he's about to do. &gt;&gt; He wants you to step out and say, "You know what? This is the God that I serve and exactly what he said he's going to do, he going to do it." &gt;&gt; And it's just that simple. Sometimes it takes the faith of a mustard seed to move the mountain. &gt;&gt; That's all it takes. And sometimes we making it this big complicated thing and oh, I got to see this happen and this happen. But all you have to do is believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. All you have to do is step out and say, "Lord, I'm not afraid no more." &gt;&gt; That devil that's been testing me, I'm not afraid of them no more. That trial that's I've been going through, I'm not afraid of it no more. That person I've been praying about, I'm not afraid of what you going to do in their life. Lord, I'm not afraid of how you going to do it. Cuz when you work, you going to work it just right like you supposed to. said, "I was going through a situation and I had prayed about it and I prayed for this person and I said, "God, I I got to the point that you can care so much that you have to say, Lord, your will be done." &gt;&gt; And then when they start going through the situation, you be ready to try to block that prayer like, "Lord, don't let it happen that way. Lord, don't let it happen that way." And God had to tell me, he said it, "You pray for their soul. You prayed for their heart. Now, don't be afraid of how I take them through it. Now, don't be scared of how I let them go through it because that's what they need to if that's what they need to get to where they need to get to, I got to let them go through it. And God had to stop me. I said, you know, I'm going to pray your will be done. &gt;&gt; I'm going to pray that your will be done cuz that's the only prayer that I can pray. I don't want to block God from doing the work that he's doing if that's the work that he got to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, "All I believe in is that trust that God is going to do what he said he going to do." &gt;&gt; He said, "I never lost one." So if he ain't never lost one, I can hold on and stand on that. I can trust God for it and I can move in faith on it. I don't have to be afraid of what's going to happen because it's all going to turn out for their good. It's going to turn out for my good. So I can release this burden. I can let the stress go. I can let all these things go because God is working it for the good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said I I don't have to be afraid of what's going to happen no more. &gt;&gt; I I can go to sleep in peace. &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about it no more. And the burdens that I'm carrying, I got to take them to the Lord and leave them there. &gt;&gt; And and when I walk away, not pick them up no more. &gt;&gt; Said that's been a prayer, a constant prayer I've been praying. Lord, don't let me pick up the burden. &gt;&gt; You took it from me. Now don't let me pick it up again. &gt;&gt; Because you don't sometimes you don't even realize the effect of the burdens that you carry. &gt;&gt; You don't even realize how much it may weigh to you and and take you through things in your daily and personal life because you carrying someone else's burden. &gt;&gt; That ain't yours. &gt;&gt; And sometime God just trying to show you, hey, let it go. &gt;&gt; Let it go. Let it go. And taking you through ups and downs. So to let it go, let it go. And you still struggling. Well, Lord, I really can't you. Sometimes you can't be afraid and just say, "Lord, let it I let it go." &gt;&gt; And and whatever you got to do, you got to do it because it's what I asked you for. &gt;&gt; It's what I prayed for. It's what I what I leaned on you for. And that's what you said. The song says Jesus said, "Let me lean on you." &gt;&gt; See, cuz I got to lean on you cuz I can't carry the burden. &gt;&gt; I can't do it. The devil is fighting me enough to be fighting for somebody else. I can stand in the gap and pray. That's all that I can do is pray &gt;&gt; and pray that God, hey, you have your perfect will in your perfect way. And he said, and I love that. And Jesus rose from the dead and his words constantly was, "Fear not." And that's what the trouble with the church is today is scared to death, you're going to make a failure. How many times did God bring you through something and you scared that you're going to go back and do the same thing he brought you through? He said, "Many of times we're scared. You're going to you're scared to death you're going to make a failure. How can you fail when you're in Christ?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't fail. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You've got everlasting life. All demons in hell can't shake you. &gt;&gt; You've got eternal everlasting life." Jesus said so. So don't be scared of failure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many of times we are scared. We scared to take the next step cuz we scared that we're going to fail. We're scared that what whatever God has told us to do, we scared that we not going to be able to accomplish it. But if God told you to do it, &gt;&gt; you can't be afraid of what God told you to do. &gt;&gt; It's not for you to figure out. It's not for you to work out. It's all for you just to trust and believe and do what he told you to do. And I can't tell you what God has told you to do. Cuz each one of us have a purpose and a will for God to do in our lives. We have a purpose that God want to show forth. He wants to work in our lives. He wants to use us. He wants to mold us and shape us that we can be those vessels that he can pour into and he can let the overflow that those around us can be blessed by the things that God is doing in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, but you can't don't be scared of failure. Many of times a lot of people don't achieve a lot of things because they are afraid of failure. &gt;&gt; It's just like the man in the Bible with the talents. He was so afraid of losing his one talent. He went and buried it. &gt;&gt; Many of times God has given us so many wonderful gifts, so many precious gifts, but we don't we we afraid to use them because we don't know how it's going to turn out. We we we we afraid to let God use those gifts and talents because we don't want to be used in this way or we don't want God to use us in that way. You know, that might just put too much exposure on us. I had a friend that was praying. He said, "Lord, he he was talking about it and I had to tell him, man, you you you asking God to use you, but then you saying God only use me this way, this way, and this way." See, you're putting limitations on the prayer that you just prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if that's how God want to use you, you you that that that's that got to be your desire. If that's your true heart's desire, if you asking God, Lord, I I want you to allow me to be a witness. Well, God will put people in your life that you can witness to. And sometimes it may not be by your words. It's by the life that you living. &gt;&gt; You never know how many people you if God allows us to when we get over there, they'll come up and say, "Hey, I only made it because the life you was living. I only get I only came to know who God was because the life that you was living. &gt;&gt; I know I ain't never say nothing to you, but your life was a testimony to me that there was something. There was a God that was real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you was telling those testimonies at work, it was a God that was real. I knew there was a difference between everybody else and you. See, there has to be a difference between everybody else and you. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, then what's the difference between God and the devil? Amen. &gt;&gt; There has to be a right and there has to be a wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though society now is blurring the lines. &gt;&gt; But there is a right and there is a wrong. There has to be something that you standing on that you know is true. &gt;&gt; There has to be something that you know deep down in the inside that checks you that you know that is different than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That points out that what is good and what's not. &gt;&gt; What what is right and what is wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you have to listen to that voice. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to hear the voice. It's another thing to listen to that voice and obey the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Many people might hear it, but a lot of people ain't listening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And many people they listening, but they ain't doing no actions behind it. &gt;&gt; God want us to act on what he's given us. &gt;&gt; God want us to move in the direction that he's caused us and told us to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me get down here. He said, "That's good. Just march on. Don't get scared about nothing. If you've accepted Christ as your savior, go on." And he said, someone asked, "Brother Brandon, I want the baptism of the Holy Ghost." He said, "Just keep moving. Don't fear. You say, I'm sick now, brother Brandham. I can't get much further. Don't worry. Just keep on moving. See the salvation of the Lord. Accept it. Just move on." And said, "How is it going to be? The doctor turned me down." Now, the fella done the best that he could, but God hasn't done his best yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. Just a moment. Listen at him. All right. [Applause] And he said that the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall and ye shall and ye shall hold your peace. He said, see, God is sometimes taking us through things to show forth his his handiwork. He's taking us through things so that we our faith can be elevated. Cuz at some point in time, you got to have a faith that God can translate your body. &gt;&gt; You got to have faith that God can transition, take you straight on out of this world. Just like Enoch, he walked so close with God that one day God just took him on. &gt;&gt; But do you have the faith to believe that one day I'm going to step out of this dimension into that dimension? I'm going to step right on out of here into where into the presence of God. Do you have that faith yet? And if not, God might be taking you through things to build your faith to get you there, get you there. And it's and you wonder why you going through test after test after test cuz you don't have that much time. &gt;&gt; In other times and seasons, they might have had many, many years to get ready. But when times is eluding us, every day the days are getting shorter. So God got to speed up the process to take you through stuff because he's trying to get you to the point that you can be raptured out of here. He's trying to get you to the point that you no longer afraid of nothing because God has all in control. And not only that, you can stand on it. You you have no wavering faith on it. That whatever God is putting in front of you, he going to take you through it. And he's going to deliver you out of it. And he's going to take it to the point that you can speak and it will be. You going to take it to the point that you can be here and be there because God has translated you there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God has allowed us and taken us through these things that they can be testimonies, but to elevate your faith to the point that one day you can translate on out of here. &gt;&gt; That you can be ready to say, Lord, hey, if if it be, Lord, let it be. And it shall be. And that's why the the the squeeze may come, but you won't be afraid of it. They may shut this down and they might cause this to go down that you may not be able to get food but by that time you'll be able to speak it and and it'll be there because you have such a faith that God that the impossible is possible that that that God is the God of the impossible and with him there's nothing that can't be done with him there's nothing that is impossible and I have such a faith that God can do anything more than exceeded abundantly more than I can even ask or think that I can just go ahead and just believe God and just let it be. &gt;&gt; I can believe God and just let it happen. Lord, I don't have to be afraid no more that you can deliver cuz I seen you do it enough for me just to accept it on faith. I don't have to believe that you can say cuz I seen you do it enough. It doesn't matter how low the person is. God can bring them out. It doesn't matter what they going through, God can bring them out. See, I got a faith now to trust God in anything and everything because of what God is doing. I have a faith now to believe that God can move the mountain. I don't even have to see it move. I know that God is moving the mountain. See, that's the different time you when you start to get to that level, your your your speech changes. Your speech changes because you realize how real God is. That he's sitting right next to you and the God isn't a far off in heaven above. He's right here with me. And I don't have to go far to touch him. I can just reach out and he's reaching out to me. I can believe that he's right here cuz I know he's right here. He said when two or three are gathered in my name there, he would be in the midst. So if I'm here and you're here, God is here. &gt;&gt; See, I'm not afraid no more to speak as it shall be. &gt;&gt; Because he gave me the power and the authority to to do that. &gt;&gt; He said, if I be in you and you be in me, ask what you will and I'll do it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be afraid to to ask God for the things that he said he shall supply all my needs. So if it's a need, &gt;&gt; I can speak it and it'll be cuz he said that he would do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I'm not afraid no more when the devil comes to knock on my door. &gt;&gt; Because I know that he defeated him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know that once you recognize and God open your eyes that you can see that the who is with you is greater than the enemy that's coming against you. &gt;&gt; You can hey your speech will change already. When you realize that the God that's with you is greater than all the host of the the devil and all the enemy put together. &gt;&gt; See when see when the devil was kicked out of heaven only a third of the angels was kicked out. So there was still twothirds that was up there that was serving God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the difference was the devil can't create nothing, but God can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if God wanted more, he could he can create more at any given time. He could have created a new a new more angels to replace the ones that that he lost. But you see, God is able to do these things. And he just wants us to tap in and say, "Lord, I believe in what you can do. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm no longer afraid in what you what you're able to do for me. Lord, I know you've done it for sister and brother, but God, I now I got faith to stand for myself. Lord, I got faith to believe for myself that you can do what you said you would do for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I'm not looking at anybody else cuz they faith can't can't they can't move the mountains in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can pray for it, but sometimes I got to I got to believe for myself. Sometimes I got to get down and get on my knees and say, "Lord, I need you to move this mountain in my life." Some some mountains in your life, nobody knows about it, but you and God. Nobody knows what you're going through, but you and God. And you got to get down and say, "Lord, I need you to do the work in my life." And and it's only going to be a testimony of what you're capable of doing. It's only a testimony of what you're able to do. Do do it do because of your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was reading something and it said, he said, "You're always pointing how wicked the world is getting, but you failed to see how powerful the church is getting. At the same time, she's rising up, standing on the field. Oh, she's a little flock, but brother, God is with her, and she's going to triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead." Amen. God's church shall never fail. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Show that they would be against it, but they cannot prevail. The church is going to triumph through the blood of Jesus Christ with a victory march. I'm positive of this one thing that God will have a church without spot, wrinkle, or blemish. Amen. And I'm I'm so happy about it. See, the gates of hell will not prevail. He said they might be against it but they cannot prevail because there's something standing against them and you and that's the blood of Jesus. And if you are not under the blood you need to get under the blood. You need to get there like like yesterday because tomorrow is not promised to you. Tomorrow is not something you can guarantee. Because if we could guarantee tomorrow, listen, many of people will be coming to you and giving you every dime in their pocket if you could guarantee them one more one more minute when they come down to the end. But it's not guaranteed. Everybody has a time and a season that God only knows. And sometimes God sometimes start to prepare you when your season come. But but sometimes it come all of a sudden and you don't have time to fix the things that you think that you should fix. But if God has placed it on your heart to fix it, fix it now. &gt;&gt; There there there's no reason to let it linger on till tomorrow when you can fix it now. Not only if you fix it now, the stress and all the relief that that'll bring to you, you're not accounting for that cuz you just think it's got to be this grand ceremonial thing, but if it if it's something small, sometimes that's all God wants you to do. So you can stop blocking your blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that you you can stop blocking what God has for you and and not be afraid. You know what, God? If you're removing this, you got something greater for me. &gt;&gt; If you taking me out of this, you got something better for me. &gt;&gt; It said and and I I was telling one of my friends, I said, "Sometimes I feel like right now is the season of change. It's the season of change. And when the se when when changes start coming sometimes you don't like the changes when the it's just like the weather right now. You might not like how it was this morning if you walked outside. You might have walked out with a short sleeve and said I might need a jacket today. And you might not like wearing jackets, but but you see you might not like the seasons when they change. But there's a reason that the seasons have to change. There's a reason that things have to have to cycle and revolve and that we have a winter. We have a cold time and we have a hot time and we have a time where things bloom and we have a time where things die. Because without these seasons, the world wouldn't work as they would. We wouldn't have crops. We wouldn't have food to eat. The the sun and the moon, if the moon wasn't there, then the tides wouldn't move. And when you realize how intricate God allowed this universe to be, it can only prove that even if he cares that much about the universe, how about you and me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he cares about the sparrows, how about you and me? &gt;&gt; The ones that can go to God and talk to God and God can talk to us. So if he cares about the little bird sitting on the tree, what about you and me? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, I don't have to be afraid to go to God anymore because God loves me more than I may love him. &gt;&gt; He loves me so abundantly that he he let Jesus come down and die for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He thought about me before the foundation of the world and thought about all my m all my mistakes, all my trials, my tribulations, all my failures and said, "You know what? I'm still going to choose him. &gt;&gt; I'm still going to allow him to be saved. I'm still going to allow him to hear the word in this last day. You know what? I'm going to put him in this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God knew from the beginning of time if he put you here, he would give you the ability and the equipment to use that you could overcome in this day and age. &gt;&gt; So, it's not an excuse to say, "Well, this is just how it is." That's not that's not a good excuse &gt;&gt; because God done been delivering for for 6,000 years or so. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if God ain't changed, if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, you can't use that as an excuse. &gt;&gt; Well, we got the internet and so it's so much more available. No, there was trials and tribulations then, too. &gt;&gt; But you got to have the ability and say, "Lord, I want to overcome the enemy that's in front of me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to overcome the enemies that's in my life. Lord, I want you to do the work that I can be a testimony of what God can do." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I'm no longer afraid that God is going to keep me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer afraid that if I make this decision, it's the it's the right decision or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I know the God that that's been keeping those that are in front of me. I know that's the same God because I've seen him work in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that's the same God cuz I I've heard him speak to me. And if you haven't had those experiences, then you need to get down to where you can have those experiences with God. Cuz I believe that if you go to God in sincerity, he will answer your prayers. &gt;&gt; If you go to God and and sometimes you might not even be in in in the perfect condition on the outside. You might be in your lowest moment, but when if you go to God in sincerity, I believe that he'll answer your prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. that I I believe that and you can't be afraid to go to God just because of where you are and what you going through. See, God is going to give you the victory if you re if that's what you want. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I'm reminded of the story and I close with this. I'm reminded of the story with brother Brandham. There was a man that came into the meeting and he had a reputation for being a very strong man, but he was demonp possessed. And the demons would tell him to go up there and beat up the preacher. And when when when he would do these things, he came into brother Brando's meeting one day and he came up to the pool pit and he was going and the spirit of God allowed brother Brandon to speak to him and brother Brando spoke to it and the spirit left him and somebody asked him is he delivered. He said no. He said because he loves that spirit. So many of times you have to be careful that you don't get attached to those things that are in your life because they may be holding you back from getting your true deliverance. You have to be careful that you aren't holding on to things that God want you to let go for your for your blessings and for your healing because you're holding on to something. Don't let that be your story or your testimony because God may be trying to take you to a higher place and a higher level. And the only way for you to get there is to let things go. &gt;&gt; The only way for you to get there is to go to God and say, "Lord, I'm not afraid no more of what's going to happen or how it's going to turn out or what it's going to be. Lord, I know that you've given me the victory. &gt;&gt; I know that you worked this out in such a way that Lord, that I can be honest and I can be truthful with you that Lord, I've given it all to you." Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's it. That settles it. I I'm not worried no more because God, I know that you doing the thing that you said you would do. &gt;&gt; And if you said you would do it and you defeated all the demons of hell on Calvary, then that's it. &gt;&gt; I don't know how, but I know that you'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] [Music] Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Perfect love cast out fear because fear has torment and fears of the devil." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We thank God for the word tonight. We thank God for brother McBride and brother David. Amen. His wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dave, come and greet us. You I don't think you ever greeted us before. I don't know if you have or not, but come and greet us. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet all of us in the name of our Lord and Savior as always. Thank God for the word again tonight, brother. And uh Amen. Lord use you like that as a precious pastor said, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; But he didn't give you a spirit of fear. He give you a spirit of power, love, and a sound mind. &gt;&gt; And brother Ben said, "Power is to overcome these things that come upon us." It's just what he was preaching. &gt;&gt; So that power is down inside your soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that same power must rebuke this flesh every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what being said today, too. I pick up that like that. But I I thank God to be able to come over here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told brother Simmons the other day, pastor, I said, I'm come over to Friday night cuz our church is gone up to Jeffersonville. So I said, brother answer said, "Y'all need to visit somebody." I said, "Well, I'm going to visit Brother Simmons then." That's what I'm don't get a chance to come over here on Friday night cuz your poster duty. &gt;&gt; But I thank God for all of y'all. And uh thank God for this message tonight. &gt;&gt; And we must take this message to heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see must when the message come like this something going to transpire after that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This a part that uh if we die daily we can this message will live about us &gt;&gt; just preached tonight. Fear not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not no time. But he was preaching too about certain experiences. There a lot of young people in here. There's a lot of elder people. It's a great mixture in here. There's a lot of people that older people like myself. We had a great lot of experiencing things. And sometime young people might be a little bit harder when when they just starting out and having these trials and tribulations and things, but God predestinated them for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You predestinated. He said night before the foundation of the world. So every trial you have, this great God saw every trial and he predestinated that trial for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; I thank y'all. Amen. [Applause] Since he was so short, brother McBride, come on and greet us. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I thought brother David take a little time. He was short. [Music] I'm probably going to be shorter. Amen. Thank God for being here. I think that's my third time hearing our brother minister and it was a blessing. Amen. Um just God knows what to give us in the right times and seasons and so we thank him for all that he's doing. Thank him from one another and uh he's preparing us to leave this place and and go to our real home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I can't wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Everybody show it tonight. Amen. And we thank the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not. Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of things we could fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Amen. There's fearful sights, &gt;&gt; signs in heaven above, &gt;&gt; earth beneath. &gt;&gt; Said the sun shall turn into the darkness and the moon in the blood before the great and notable day of the Lord come. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said, "But whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall be delivered. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God we can call on him. &gt;&gt; And we shall be delivered. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Not shall, but we are delivered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we call on the name of the Lord. For the name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous runth to it and they're safe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So glad that we got a place that we can hide because the storm. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not in the ocean, but it's right among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a storm out in the ocean, &gt;&gt; and it's coming this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the storm has already come this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God will keep you in the storm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel the storm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the storm, God walks on the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And said to Peter, Amen. Come on out here. You don't have to You don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the ship Amen. Praise God. Look like it's going to sink. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And everybody on the ship is afraid. Praise God. Somebody said, "Go wake Jesus." &gt;&gt; I'm glad we we know what to do in the midst of the storm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know who's in the ship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, fear not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stood up and he said, "Peace be still." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what he is. He said, "My peace I give you, not as the world give give by you." &gt;&gt; God has given us peace in this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said the world has gone into total insanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you Amen. you that have the Holy Ghost, you have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you got to shelter in the midst of all this chaos and confusion. &gt;&gt; Get into Christ &gt;&gt; before you lose your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Get in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Because nothing out there but insanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing out there in the world but insanity. &gt;&gt; The same place is in the word of God. Brother Ernest, come closes. Amen. Let us stand tonight and appreciate you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; You appreciate the word tonight. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. Let us just bow for a moment. I I didn't do that. Father, in Jesus name, we thank you, Lord. Maybe there's somebody that's battling the spirit of fear, God. Maybe there's some type of trouble, some type of problem in somebody's life tonight. But God, we know that you, oh God, not Amen. giving us a spirit of fear, but a power of love and a sound mind. So, Father, whatever the spirit is tonight, or whoever is battling a spirit of fear, Father, there may be a situation, maybe a problem, a condition, Lord, Lord, you want to speak to tonight, Lord. Lord, you spoken tonight, Lord. And Lord, we receive tonight. We receive deliverance tonight, Lord. We heard your word tonight &gt;&gt; and you said fear not Lord. So Lord, we're not going to fear tonight. &gt;&gt; We're going to say I have faith, &gt;&gt; Lord, in your word, Lord. Lord, I'm trusting you &gt;&gt; because my God is more than able &gt;&gt; to do what his word said. &gt;&gt; And I'm declaring the victory tonight. And Lord, I say I declare victory tonight. victory over every circumstances, every condition, every problem, every situation. Tonight, I'm claiming victory tonight. &gt;&gt; Somebody claim victory tonight. Somebody believe tonight, somebody give it to Jesus tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe tonight you believe you got the victory? &gt;&gt; Oh, forget about the Egyptian army. Forget about the situation. Forget about the condition. Look, fear not. &gt;&gt; Have faith in God &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the word tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's so many good things that was said tonight. Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; I was thinking uh as brother Simmons here at the end was talking about the world insane &gt;&gt; and the only sane place is in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about the other day I picked Moses up from school and and we saw something. I told Moses I said I said man in the '9s they would have been put in a mental institution if they came out the house like that. I said the people would have know they was out of their mind. And I was talking to some boys at work and I was sharing with them something and they told me they don't even go to church the boys. They said, "Ernest, you know the whole world has gone crazy." They said, "But the crazy is acceptable now." And I said, "That's something, ain't it?" &gt;&gt; That we know that it was going to be the whole world gone insane. &gt;&gt; And it's acceptable, but it's still not acceptable to God because he said, "I'm the Lord and I change not." Right? So I says when we see where the world is going, we can be thankful that God has kept our minds. That we still got a mind to want to do right. Still got a mind on Friday night to want to come out to the house of God. No matter how tired you are, no matter what you got going on, you still want to worship God. Amen. So I thought that I said, "The Lord knows." I says the the more the darker the age get. It might not be but a few of us but the brighter the light go shine. Amen. I mean appreciate that tonight. Amen. It was so many good things that was said tonight. And I thank the Lord. Amen. Uh the word is coming but it's you got to receive it. Amen. As Mary took it and pondered on it in her heart. You got to do the same thing cuz the word will work for you. Amen. It's no nothing small with God. When God releases the word it's great. Remember that his word has got an ability like brother Caleb was saying things changing you know it might not be but one grain of sand at a time but that mountain is moving you know and the longer as as he said you live in this life you learn to let go and just let God have his way with a lot of things Lord I'm giving it all to you right because you keep carrying those things you won't be able to sleep at night up word blood pressure up all those things but you you learn with some things and say Lord I'm just giving to you, &gt;&gt; Lord. I'm going to let you have it because I know that you're able and you will take care of it. How many believe that tonight? Amen. God is so good. Amen. Let us bow our heads again. Amen. Lord, we just thank you tonight for the word that we heard, Lord. And oh, our brother pouring his heart out, Lord. There was so many golden nuggets that were given out. Oh God, I believe that if we can take it, &gt;&gt; oh God, and live by it, oh that it'll be a blessing to our hearts. It'll bless our homes. It'll bless our lives. It'll bless those that are around us. And that's what we love. We love the blessings of God because we know that when you bless us, it don't add no sorrow to it. Oh God, we thank you for that tonight. Continue to bless our brother Caleb. Lord, bless, oh God, those that here, Lord. Oh God, bless brother Anderson knows Lord as they're traveling the highways and oh God I just pray that you'd bless your children all over the land Lord as we depart this place but never your presence. We thank you and Lord we love you in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Let the church say amen. [Music]
