[35:09] ask these things Lord in the name of
[35:11] Jesus Christ amen and amen
[35:18] yeah your Bibles you turn with me to the
[35:21] Book of Joshua
[35:23] first chapter
[35:28] the Book of Joshua
[35:38] let's start at the third verse
[35:43] I want to take you somewhat from another
[35:44] angle
[35:51] Joshua one and three
[35:55] notice this is after Moses had went off
[35:58] the scene
[35:59] and God raised up Joshua
[36:03] a man to take the people into the land
[36:06] and give them the inheritance
[36:09] and he says third person every place
[36:12] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[36:15] upon
[36:16] that have I given unto you
[36:19] as I said unto Moses
[36:22] from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even
[36:25] into the Great River of the river
[36:26] Euphrates
[36:28] all the land of the Hittites and until
[36:30] the great sea toward the going down of
[36:33] the sun shall be your course
[36:35] there should not any man be able to
[36:38] stand before the all the days of their
[36:40] life as I was with Moses so shall I be
[36:44] with thee
[36:45] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[36:51] strong and have a good courage for
[36:54] little people that divide for an
[36:57] inheritance the land which I swear to
[37:00] their fathers to give them Lord bless
[37:03] Thy word Sanctified in Jesus name he may
[37:07] be seated amen
[37:13] be
[37:14] we do appreciate you man the Lord and
[37:16] Jesus Christ and
[37:19] amen the things that God is with them in
[37:21] doing Amen in our lives and in your
[37:24] lives
[37:26] but tonight I wanna
[37:28] just share just a little bit
[37:32] um I took it from another angle in
[37:34] Marion but in the night with all the
[37:36] grace but I want to talk about God will
[37:40] not fail thee
[37:42] God
[37:44] will not fail thee
[37:49] many of times and we know
[37:53] in humans
[37:55] their failures
[37:59] we are limited to
[38:03] what we are able to do even after we
[38:07] have said it
[38:09] because of situations or circumstances
[38:14] that may arise in our life and we are
[38:18] not able to keep the obligation or the
[38:21] thing that we really mean to do
[38:27] here
[38:29] and I like to say I know now I'm a
[38:33] learning
[38:34] uh the older you'll get you realize
[38:39] that you have
[38:41] no confidence in any kind of ability you
[38:44] have even your own health
[38:48] is failing us everything around us is
[38:51] failing
[38:52] there's nothing basic you can find that
[38:55] is the same basic anymore the food
[39:00] it causing people to be more sicker than
[39:03] ever before
[39:05] the water
[39:06] I never thought we had to buy water
[39:11] just to get something healthy in our
[39:13] body
[39:15] more people now are trying and it's a
[39:17] good thing nothing wrong with that uh
[39:19] trying to eat better that's good
[39:22] there's nothing wrong but even all of
[39:24] that it's still a fail
[39:28] because Satan
[39:31] and what he is doing in this hour
[39:35] he is contaminated everything there is
[39:37] on the Earth
[39:40] when God made everything from the
[39:41] beginning it was good
[39:44] the food they ate back in the day and
[39:49] you look at it versus what we eating
[39:51] today Lord have mercy
[39:54] but it was healthy they grew it uh
[39:58] they live off the land they live off the
[40:00] thing that they planted
[40:02] without any kind of spring or any kind
[40:05] of chemical
[40:06] the ground will fertile
[40:11] God intended
[40:13] even for us that as we eat the food from
[40:16] the land
[40:17] it had nourishment in it
[40:20] uh it gave you the vitamins that you
[40:23] need in your body uh it made your immune
[40:26] system strong
[40:28] to fight off disease
[40:31] but now that's one of the reasons why
[40:33] people are sicker than ever before
[40:35] because of immune system has been torn
[40:38] down
[40:40] by the things that we eat no wonder you
[40:43] said you have to bless your food
[40:46] and I guess God to Sanctified
[40:49] because we got to eat something
[40:52] and God have to come and do something
[40:54] for us that our food really is not
[40:58] giving us what we need to make up a bone
[41:01] strong and as we get sicker our body
[41:05] needs more time now to heal
[41:08] but in all of that we are learning that
[41:13] God is in control
[41:17] the more you realize it the more it is
[41:19] if you live long enough you'll start
[41:22] learning some things
[41:25] you'll learn one thing that life is like
[41:27] a vapor
[41:29] you here today can be gone tomorrow
[41:33] it doesn't have no age
[41:36] no respectable persons
[41:40] we are living on God's time
[41:44] and that's why my time your time is
[41:46] winding up
[41:49] and I'm learning and leaning every day
[41:52] is my wife saying the song learning how
[41:54] to lean
[41:56] and depend on Jesus
[41:59] because I found out
[42:02] and you'll find out
[42:04] you're gonna have to trust God for
[42:06] everything you have need of
[42:09] because even in your best trying your uh
[42:12] best that you may do in your life many
[42:16] of us have found out
[42:18] sometimes it don't work
[42:20] we fail
[42:23] and then we have to try something else
[42:27] but I'm learning the best thing that we
[42:30] can do is put your trust in Jesus
[42:34] here
[42:37] God was
[42:39] has brought
[42:41] Israel out of Egypt
[42:46] they were in bondage and Egypt was the
[42:48] type of the world
[42:50] God Israel had gotten to a place in
[42:54] their life
[42:56] that the Taskmaster were putting a heavy
[43:00] burden on them and they were in bondage
[43:03] they
[43:05] couldn't enjoy the freedom that God gave
[43:10] them they began to start crying out
[43:14] for God to send them a deliverer and God
[43:18] did so
[43:19] you know when the people begin to cry
[43:22] out to God
[43:25] the Bible said when there's a deep
[43:26] calling to the Deep there's got to be a
[43:29] deep there to respond
[43:32] and when we start crying out for God I
[43:36] believe God will come on the scene
[43:40] and it's crying that God has to get us
[43:42] to a place
[43:43] trouble arises to get us to cry out
[43:48] normally people don't begin to cry out
[43:51] until something calls them to cry out
[43:56] that is the case look what we got
[43:59] going on now
[44:02] there's never a day and never a time
[44:04] that we have something and so much as
[44:08] somebody said look like things are
[44:11] happening so continuously
[44:15] death and killing and the sickness and
[44:19] disasters
[44:22] seem to be arising and arising one over
[44:25] it get over one thing then there's
[44:27] something else
[44:31] you know I believe as Christians when we
[44:35] understand that
[44:37] we have a God that sees and knows
[44:40] everything
[44:43] he knows everything that's going on he
[44:47] sees your situation he sees mine
[44:53] and I like it it's so great because the
[44:55] Bible say God is the same yesterday
[44:58] today and forever
[45:00] in other words there is no fail
[45:04] in God Amen
[45:07] I'm glad that we got somebody that won't
[45:12] fail us
[45:13] somebody that keeps his word
[45:19] so many times it's hard to find somebody
[45:23] that'll keep their word and that I do
[45:26] what they say uh they'll do but I want
[45:31] to tell you tonight that I know somebody
[45:36] who won't fail you
[45:39] I know somebody that is never too late
[45:43] but he is always on time and they're
[45:46] saying this on he's an on time God
[45:50] yes see how many of you know that
[45:51] tonight
[45:53] you may think that God is late
[45:57] because it seemed that your situation
[46:00] then got to a place that where you can't
[46:04] bear it anymore but God sits high and he
[46:08] looks low
[46:10] I'm reminded of Meshach Shadrach and the
[46:14] Bendigo
[46:15] amen when they were faced with a
[46:18] situation that the king uh sent out of
[46:23] the Korean uh wanted them to bow down
[46:28] but they refused to do it
[46:32] tell you something when you face a
[46:34] situation like that and you're facing
[46:37] some Troublesome
[46:39] situations in your life
[46:42] and you have to stand still and know
[46:45] that God is real
[46:49] and I believe if we ever gonna know that
[46:53] God is real you must know him right now
[46:57] uh we as individuals we're going to face
[47:02] thing we're going to have to deal with
[47:04] situations that physically you are not
[47:08] going to be able to do nothing about
[47:11] but I believe this
[47:13] I believe if you keep your hand as they
[47:17] said in the Master Hand he'll come when
[47:21] you need him the most
[47:24] uh Israel and Joshua now was or a little
[47:29] March that God has started something and
[47:33] I I like it because when God starts
[47:36] something he knows how to finish it
[47:38] he just don't start something and say
[47:40] well uh it's too hard now in uh 2023 and
[47:45] I can't deal with all of this y'all got
[47:47] going on now I need to go find some more
[47:50] Revenue
[47:51] no God knows exactly what you need right
[47:57] now
[47:59] oh my it gives me consolation to give me
[48:02] a peace
[48:03] I believe you know when you're going
[48:06] through a storm a lot of time you can't
[48:08] hardly find peace but I believe you can
[48:10] find peace in the midst of your storm
[48:13] and why is not because you're trusting
[48:16] in yourself but you trusting somebody
[48:19] you know
[48:21] that you know he is real and you know
[48:25] that no matter what it is how difficult
[48:29] it may get there ain't nothing
[48:32] too hard for the Lord
[48:36] uh no it doesn't matter what the doctor
[48:39] has told you what he can't do you gotta
[48:43] hire a doctor than that
[48:45] oh yeah because medicine and thank God
[48:49] for all the signs and medicine but there
[48:53] is so much that they can do
[48:57] and that's why I heard the server God
[48:59] said you know evening medicine it don't
[49:01] heals
[49:04] it just AIDS
[49:05] God is the Healer
[49:08] I believe in taking your medicine like
[49:10] you ought to but you know that it still
[49:13] isn't God hand to heal
[49:17] we understand that Joshua had a great
[49:22] commission ahead of him he
[49:25] uh had to come uh behind Moses
[49:32] who had went off the scene
[49:36] and Joshua saw how God moved with Moses
[49:42] and but Joshua commission was different
[49:46] Moses brought him out of Egypt but
[49:49] Joshua was supposed to carry them into
[49:52] the land
[49:53] and divide the inheritance
[49:57] Joshua could no longer depend on what
[50:01] more God were dealing with Moses
[50:04] now God will want to deal with Joshua
[50:08] I believe so many times that so many
[50:11] people get uh uh depending upon a menace
[50:16] person that they can't really see God
[50:20] for themself
[50:23] and I believe that God is now is looking
[50:26] for each and every one of us to know God
[50:30] for yourself
[50:31] you're gonna have to know that he is not
[50:35] what but he is Jehovah Jireh that he'll
[50:39] fight your battle
[50:41] that he will provide for you
[50:45] as he did it for Dempsey now the god
[50:48] that did it there can do it now because
[50:52] it's not a different God it's the same
[50:55] God
[50:56] in that day he dealt with them you know
[51:00] in a natural Lane but in this hour he's
[51:03] dealing with other internet manner but
[51:06] he's the same God
[51:08] he is same in power
[51:10] he is same in Deliverance he is same in
[51:14] Saving he is Sam in healing he is saved
[51:20] in every aspect he ever was he has not
[51:24] changed
[51:27] oh my I'm glad somebody don't change
[51:32] amen all of us change but God don't
[51:36] he changed his mouth he changes the way
[51:39] uh that he dealt with Israel as a nation
[51:42] but now in the Gentiles he's dealing
[51:45] with us individually
[51:48] each of us God is dealing with you in
[51:51] his own way according to your faith
[51:54] that's why it behooves a sister brother
[51:57] if you don't know God now as your
[52:00] personal Savior Please
[52:03] get to know him
[52:05] I mean to know him now is by an
[52:08] experience
[52:09] in by a revelation that I'm not
[52:12] depending on what Daddy them told me
[52:15] do what they told me was good I need to
[52:18] know him myself
[52:21] we can't live off what the early church
[52:25] uh you know done and how God had dealt
[52:29] with them but God's still dealing with
[52:31] us
[52:32] he still wants to deal with a church
[52:36] I'm talking about not Church
[52:38] organization but a body of believers
[52:42] that make up the body of Christ
[52:45] individuals that know that their God the
[52:50] god that we say that that he's serving
[52:52] he's not dead He's Alive
[52:56] you see me where is he at
[52:59] each one of you you are testimony that
[53:03] God is alive
[53:06] because he woke you up
[53:12] we have proof
[53:14] that God is alive
[53:18] he
[53:19] breathed this morning in us the Breath
[53:21] of Life
[53:24] if you
[53:27] don't know him
[53:29] as your personal savior I'll say again
[53:32] please ma'am
[53:34] please sir
[53:36] fine
[53:37] God now while we have a chance
[53:41] Joshua
[53:45] God had
[53:47] was dealing with him now
[53:51] and he was supposed to take the people
[53:55] over
[53:57] into the land because Moses didn't take
[54:00] him to the promised land
[54:02] Joshua dead
[54:04] Moses saw it but because of his failure
[54:07] God did not allow him to go in it but
[54:11] Joshua now the new Commander
[54:14] by the spirit of God
[54:18] and I will Joshua today is the Holy
[54:20] Ghost
[54:23] and he wants to take us not only in the
[54:27] lane but he want to positionally place
[54:31] you
[54:33] in your own lot
[54:37] in your inheritancy
[54:40] each one of us as Christian there is a a
[54:45] place that God has for you
[54:50] and in your position is power
[54:56] so many times that many people do
[54:58] they're always looking at what the other
[55:00] person is doing
[55:02] and sometimes when they look at the
[55:04] other person like that
[55:06] they looking at the man but they don't
[55:09] see that and that's why God tell uh
[55:13] Joshua now as I was with Moses
[55:16] I'm Gonna Be With You
[55:19] see as God was with the early church he
[55:24] gonna be with us
[55:25] and what God started with the early
[55:28] church the Son of God said we are in a
[55:32] continuation
[55:34] of what God started but we're here now
[55:38] to finish it
[55:39] see there was more that God wanted to do
[55:44] but he cut it off
[55:47] but now he picked it up
[55:50] and now he has given us something by the
[55:53] revelation of the word God gave us we
[55:56] know that we are moving into some things
[55:59] that God had promised in the scripture
[56:02] but it had to be somebody that God
[56:05] raised up to be able to fulfill that
[56:11] I want to ask you are we the people or
[56:14] should we look for another
[56:16] I believe we have arrived
[56:21] uh it's no more Peter Paul
[56:25] Elizabeth and those one in the Bible now
[56:29] you are the written word
[56:31] you are the living epistle you are the
[56:34] one God is looking for see
[56:39] you've got to always be
[56:40] for our people and at this
[56:43] at this of
[56:45] of Jim
[56:47] 's position God had called us to a
[56:50] higher calling
[56:53] not just going through a church
[56:56] formality and denying the power thereof
[56:59] but God has raised us up to manifest the
[57:03] very power of God in our very lives
[57:08] God in flesh
[57:10] again
[57:12] 100 devil don't like that
[57:15] he didn't know
[57:18] who Jesus really was
[57:21] but he was God in flesh
[57:25] the very word
[57:27] that was written
[57:29] the very word that was spoken all
[57:31] throughout age Harry was right there on
[57:34] Earth in flesh
[57:36] called Jesus Christ
[57:39] and that's always been the problem that
[57:42] people Miss God because they always
[57:46] looking at the flesh
[57:49] and they missed God in the man
[57:53] it wasn't that Moses was so great and
[57:56] good but it was God in Moses and that
[58:00] same God that was in Moses he got in
[58:03] Joshua and all through the Bible as God
[58:06] did that now he's saying Christ in you
[58:11] the hope of glory you see Christ no more
[58:15] it just um as people say in the church
[58:18] the building no no you the building
[58:22] that's what the Bible say your body is
[58:24] the Temple of the Holy Ghost now why you
[58:28] can't do anything with your temple
[58:30] because it's holy
[58:32] if God the Willing place
[58:36] oh my
[58:39] God oh I love that Mercy
[58:42] and we hear that songs of my Lord
[58:43] getting us ready for that great day
[58:46] but I want to tell you this is a great
[58:48] day
[58:50] because God
[58:52] now taking us to a place and listen I
[58:56] like it because how God dealt with
[58:58] Israel but God dealing with us now and
[59:01] God began to tell him to say now don't
[59:04] be afraid
[59:05] he said there are no man to be able to
[59:07] stand before you Joshua
[59:10] he said I've been with Moses and I'm
[59:13] going to be with you
[59:14] I'm not gonna fail you
[59:17] but he said be strong
[59:20] Church
[59:21] fear not little flock
[59:25] I'm with you
[59:27] even when you can't see it I'm there
[59:32] even when things are seem to be all out
[59:35] of order but don't worry little bride
[59:38] I'm right there
[59:41] God was right there with no Hebrew boy
[59:43] all the time he never left them but
[59:47] he'll let them made a choice
[59:51] they had to either tell the king we
[59:54] gonna bow but they made a choice King
[59:57] we're not careful to answer you in this
[1:00:00] matter
[1:00:01] it's the even if God don't deliver us oh
[1:00:05] my Lord
[1:00:06] see they were not looking they were
[1:00:09] looking at the Unseen
[1:00:12] there's the earring of God don't deliver
[1:00:15] us we're going to buy all
[1:00:18] see they're confidence that the god that
[1:00:21] deal with servant was right there with
[1:00:25] them I hope you know that God is with
[1:00:28] you
[1:00:32] those sickness crack your body he's
[1:00:34] still right there
[1:00:35] he went no place
[1:00:38] God doesn't look who want to see how
[1:00:40] you're going to react
[1:00:42] Seekers faith
[1:00:44] don't look at what I'm going through
[1:00:47] Faith don't look at the circular Faith
[1:00:51] look at I got the victory
[1:00:54] come on somebody
[1:00:56] regardless of how it is I know I got the
[1:01:00] victory how do you know because greater
[1:01:03] is he that is in you
[1:01:07] that he that is in the world
[1:01:11] God told him
[1:01:14] only be strong
[1:01:17] but not in your own self be strong in
[1:01:19] the Lord
[1:01:20] it in the power of His might
[1:01:24] your script and my script ain't in US
[1:01:27] but our script is in him
[1:01:30] see and that's why he said that the life
[1:01:33] that I now live
[1:01:35] see the life that I I don't live it by
[1:01:38] my own but I live because of him
[1:01:43] you know and I know we fail
[1:01:46] so many times we feel God but even in
[1:01:50] our failures God is just
[1:01:54] hmm
[1:01:56] in other words he looked beyond all your
[1:01:58] mistakes
[1:01:59] and he see your heart
[1:02:04] the people in the Bible they had
[1:02:06] failures Moses had
[1:02:09] mine happened
[1:02:12] but when you confess that
[1:02:15] and you keep going on
[1:02:18] because see God don't look at the
[1:02:21] beginning of a thing
[1:02:24] the end of the thing
[1:02:26] see because the race is not given to the
[1:02:29] Swift
[1:02:30] it's not when you get it when you come
[1:02:32] in
[1:02:33] but rather you can't endure
[1:02:37] in other words whether you can hold out
[1:02:41] hold out to the end can you hold out
[1:02:45] can you uh trust God a little while
[1:02:49] longer
[1:02:50] and understand he won't fail you
[1:02:54] whatever the God allow you to have to
[1:02:57] deal with is working together for your
[1:03:00] own good
[1:03:02] it's building a character in you that
[1:03:06] you'll be able to stand the wives of the
[1:03:10] devil
[1:03:11] and no matter what comes and gold you
[1:03:13] can say like Joe say I know
[1:03:17] My Redeemer liveth you
[1:03:23] I shall not
[1:03:26] be moved
[1:03:28] come on do all hell or sell me
[1:03:31] I shall not Abdul the devil may knock
[1:03:35] you down I'm getting up
[1:03:38] see a good man falls seven times but you
[1:03:41] get back up
[1:03:43] I tell people I'll tell you man I said
[1:03:45] says it's not how many times you get
[1:03:48] down but whether you can get back up and
[1:03:50] keep going on
[1:03:53] because if anybody when they fall down
[1:03:54] can stay down there
[1:03:56] but it takes a real rugged person to say
[1:03:59] you know what
[1:04:00] I'm not gonna quit
[1:04:03] regardless of how many times I know if I
[1:04:07] can just get back up that one day God is
[1:04:10] gonna give me the script to be able to
[1:04:13] overcome this
[1:04:16] um
[1:04:17] Hebrew boys
[1:04:20] kept going on
[1:04:22] the king got so mad
[1:04:25] and he told them to heat that thing up
[1:04:27] seven times more
[1:04:31] in other words because they don't want
[1:04:34] to bow down to me they don't want to
[1:04:36] obey me that's what the devil see you
[1:04:38] don't want to bow down to him or or fall
[1:04:41] down on what he's doing he gets upset
[1:04:45] and the King said seven times harder
[1:04:49] oh my seven times
[1:04:52] and then he went they went up there the
[1:04:56] Hebrew boys did not flinch one bit
[1:05:00] they bound them and they started walking
[1:05:04] and I can imagine you know as we go
[1:05:08] through other things in this life we
[1:05:10] Face things
[1:05:12] obstacles demon powers
[1:05:15] pressing against you
[1:05:18] everywhere you go see me you are being
[1:05:20] oppressed and depressed by demonic
[1:05:23] powers
[1:05:24] things in your life and things that
[1:05:26] their job things that the home things
[1:05:29] even with you personally
[1:05:32] I understand that personally we all go
[1:05:35] through things in our lives and we have
[1:05:38] to really understand I'm going to trust
[1:05:40] God
[1:05:41] and that's what they did they went right
[1:05:44] up to the fire
[1:05:47] and look God did not even move
[1:05:51] didn't say anything to him but he was
[1:05:54] watching why because he was not gonna
[1:05:58] fail them
[1:05:59] and they went up
[1:06:02] and went there into the fire when the
[1:06:04] men took them up to the fire they got
[1:06:06] burned
[1:06:08] but the Hebrew boy went right down into
[1:06:11] the fire why because God wasn't going to
[1:06:14] fail him
[1:06:15] see that's why God don't take you
[1:06:18] out of that situation but God I give you
[1:06:21] script to go through it
[1:06:24] somebody said if he bring you to it
[1:06:27] he'll see you through it
[1:06:30] but God know what you can bear
[1:06:32] now I'm saying he won't put no more on
[1:06:34] you he knew the Hebrew boys could bear
[1:06:36] that fire
[1:06:38] he that went right down there in it and
[1:06:40] when they got in it
[1:06:42] the king said hey
[1:06:46] hey y'all all right
[1:06:49] this okay we all right
[1:06:53] what happened even the fire that the
[1:06:57] Devil Makes for them wouldn't touch them
[1:07:01] why because God is a consuming fire
[1:07:06] not one hair off their head nothing even
[1:07:11] scorched
[1:07:12] why because God is not a failure
[1:07:16] if God promised I'll be with you I'll be
[1:07:19] in you to the end of the world God will
[1:07:22] do it
[1:07:24] he's not an Indian giver
[1:07:26] God don't say something he can't back up
[1:07:28] if God said by my stripe you are healed
[1:07:32] go ahead and praise the Lord for it
[1:07:36] go ahead and confess it
[1:07:39] say I got it
[1:07:41] I don't see it but I got it come on
[1:07:44] whatever you going through just stop
[1:07:47] confessing I got it
[1:07:52] yeah I got it
[1:07:54] what you mean you got I got it because
[1:07:57] God said I got it
[1:08:00] now we do he said every place
[1:08:03] that the soul of your foot
[1:08:07] thread upon
[1:08:08] he said I'm giving it church let me tell
[1:08:11] you something
[1:08:13] Lord have mercy even
[1:08:16] the Bible say the footstep of the
[1:08:18] righteous
[1:08:19] is ordered by the Lord
[1:08:22] God will even take your mistakes
[1:08:27] and turn them around to your own good
[1:08:30] but God already know you
[1:08:33] don't you know God already know you he
[1:08:36] know every turn you're going to take in
[1:08:39] your life
[1:08:40] and God is a lot go ahead
[1:08:43] but I'm going to assure you I'm going to
[1:08:44] take this very thing
[1:08:46] and something that was a turning point
[1:08:48] in your life
[1:08:49] that you had no idea that you've done
[1:08:53] this and then God begun to turn it
[1:08:55] around
[1:08:56] for your very good you say oh my God
[1:09:00] so many times I look now back on life
[1:09:04] the things that happen
[1:09:06] you know in my very life
[1:09:09] and I said Lord you were in it all the
[1:09:11] time
[1:09:12] and I didn't know it was church you
[1:09:14] don't know that there are many things
[1:09:16] God allow to take place and that thing
[1:09:19] might have turned you from really being
[1:09:21] destroyed
[1:09:23] and then God began to open up your eyes
[1:09:25] and you can see I protected you all the
[1:09:29] time
[1:09:31] when you should have died in that car
[1:09:34] I was the one when you should have been
[1:09:37] destroyed I'm the one that brought you
[1:09:39] out of your situation
[1:09:42] come on somebody be encouraged that God
[1:09:46] will not fail you
