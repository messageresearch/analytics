[29:55] tonight we'll turn to the Book of
[29:57] Matthew chapter
[30:16] [Applause]
[30:20] 18 Matthew chapter 18 and we're going to
[30:23] start in verse
[30:25] 21 very a very familiar script to
[30:29] some unfamiliar to some but that's
[30:32] okay Matthew 18 and
[30:39] verse Matthew chapter 15 I got the wrong
[30:43] scripture Matthew chapter 15 and and
[30:45] verse
[30:51] 21 when you got it say amen amen and it
[30:54] reads then Jesus went then and departed
[30:57] in the co of Ty and sidon and behold a
[31:00] woman of Canaan came out of the same
[31:03] coast and Cried unto him saying have
[31:06] mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my
[31:10] daughter is grievously vexed with the
[31:12] devil but he answered heard not a word
[31:15] and his disciples came and besought him
[31:17] saying send her away for she crith after
[31:21] us but he answered and said I am not
[31:24] sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[31:26] House of Israel then then came she and
[31:28] worshiped him and said Lord help me but
[31:32] he answered and said it is not me to
[31:35] take the children's bread and to cast it
[31:38] to to dogs and she said truth Lord yet
[31:42] the dogs eat of the crumbs which fth
[31:45] from the master's table then Jesus
[31:48] answered and said unto her oh woman
[31:50] great is thy faith and be it unto thee
[31:53] even as thou Wilt and her daughter was
[31:55] made whole from that very hour and amen
[31:58] God bless Serena's word you may be
[31:59] seated tonight
[32:01] amen tonight I'd like to speak on a
[32:03] topic that I entitled getting down to
[32:06] business with God getting down to
[32:09] business with God and you see in this
[32:11] story something had taken place in This
[32:14] Woman's life that she needed something
[32:16] from God she had gotten to the point
[32:19] that she was not going to be turned away
[32:21] she was not going to be disturbed by
[32:23] what was said to her she wasn't going to
[32:25] be discouraged by what was told to her
[32:28] even if it came from Jesus she wasn't
[32:30] going to take no for an answer she had
[32:33] come to the point that she had gotten
[32:35] down to business with God she had gotten
[32:37] to the point that she didn't worry about
[32:39] the no cuz she wasn't going to take no
[32:41] for an answer she had gotten to the
[32:43] point that she knew that she that her
[32:45] daughter needed something if she didn't
[32:48] get something her she her life was never
[32:50] going to be changed but she had gotten
[32:52] to that point and gotten down so the
[32:54] business that God that the Lord couldn't
[32:56] even discourage her with with his words
[32:59] she said that Lord she found a way that
[33:01] said you know what even though it might
[33:03] seem down there's a way that I can
[33:04] praise him there's a way that I can get
[33:06] things there's a blessing in there
[33:08] somewhere for me and she said when it
[33:11] wasn't meat to give the dolls to
[33:13] Children's the children's bread she said
[33:15] Lord even the dogs get the crumbs from
[33:17] the master's table see she had found a
[33:20] way to get down so down the business
[33:22] said Lord whatever you can give me I'll
[33:24] take it see sometimes you want the
[33:27] pretty package but sometimes God want to
[33:29] give you the little piece of seed that's
[33:31] going to feed all your needs you want
[33:34] the table to be spread but God gives you
[33:36] the seed and say plant the seed say
[33:39] water the seed watch the seed grow stick
[33:42] it in the light and then you don't have
[33:43] to worry about being fed no more but
[33:46] sometimes you just want the table to be
[33:48] spread for you and that only suffices
[33:50] for one meal amen amen but sometimes God
[33:53] is trying to supply more than one meal
[33:56] he's trying to supply everything that
[33:58] you asking for but are you willing to
[34:01] wait for it are you willing to get down
[34:03] to business with God that when you get
[34:05] down to him you said no matter how long
[34:08] it takes Lord I'm in need of something
[34:10] and I'm staying here until I get what I
[34:12] need from God see that's what it takes
[34:15] sometimes you got to get down to
[34:16] business with God see sometimes when you
[34:19] when you're going through something or
[34:21] you come to a space and time in life you
[34:24] realize that it takes
[34:26] patience that it takes patience if you
[34:28] live long enough and go through enough
[34:30] things you realize it takes patience for
[34:32] some
[34:33] things many times I was thinking about
[34:36] getting getting for example getting a
[34:38] car sometimes you got to save money
[34:41] before you get the car otherwise your
[34:43] payments are going to be a whole lot
[34:45] more expensive than other times so some
[34:48] people know understand what I'm talking
[34:49] about so sometimes it takes time it
[34:52] takes you putting money aside it takes
[34:54] you being steady at a job it takes you
[34:57] to putting in time and effort to be
[34:59] there because you realize this is
[35:01] something that I really want when you
[35:03] really want that car Nothing Stops you
[35:06] from getting what you want you will save
[35:08] money you'll stop going out to eat
[35:10] you'll stop spending money on gifts you
[35:12] won't go to the store because you said I
[35:14] don't want nothing because I want that
[35:16] car I want that car and that's what I
[35:19] want and if it's if it's in you you
[35:21] going to set aside a lot of things
[35:24] sometimes you got to sacrifice a lot of
[35:26] things to get what you want but see you
[35:28] got to take the same approach with God
[35:31] sometimes you got to set aside this and
[35:33] set aside that and set aside my plans
[35:35] set aside my job set aside this because
[35:38] there's nothing more important than
[35:40] getting down to business with God
[35:42] there's nothing that stand that's more
[35:44] important than you getting down on your
[35:46] knees and say Lord I need something from
[35:48] you because he can do more than you
[35:50] working all your life to get he can just
[35:53] give it to you but you got to get down
[35:55] to business with him to say Lord this is
[35:58] what I need and this is what I want you
[36:00] to do am said the prophet of God said
[36:04] when you really get down the business
[36:07] that's when God will go to acting many
[36:09] of times you wonder why God hasn't moved
[36:12] yet but then ask yourself have you
[36:14] gotten down to business with God yet
[36:17] have you really decided that you wanted
[36:18] to surrender all did you really get down
[36:21] and say Lord I want to give you
[36:23] everything have you gotten to that point
[36:25] yet but yet you still going to God Lord
[36:28] why hasn't it not happened yet Lord why
[36:30] hasn't this taken place Lord I asked you
[36:33] on this day at this time that I needed
[36:35] this this this that and the other God
[36:37] didn't
[36:38] fail so what's the
[36:40] problem if God is the same yesterday
[36:43] today and forever then what's the
[36:45] problem it's not God it's you then you
[36:49] got to look at yourself and say Lord
[36:51] have I died out enough Lord have I
[36:53] stayed down on my knees long enough Lord
[36:55] have I come to you and gotten with you
[36:57] and said Lord I'm getting down the
[36:59] business with you
[37:00] today sometimes you always waiting for
[37:03] the next day to come and say I'll do it
[37:05] tomorrow well if it didn't happen today
[37:07] it might happen tomorrow but no
[37:09] sometimes you got to get down and said
[37:10] Lord I need it to happen for me today
[37:12] Lord right now Lord I need it to happen
[37:15] for me because when you really get down
[37:17] the business that's when God will go to
[37:19] acting see God God seen this woman's
[37:22] Faith he realized that you know what she
[37:25] she didn't even care whether he called
[37:27] her a do or
[37:28] not many of times we can't take nothing
[37:31] that people say about you but in order
[37:33] to get what God got for you you got to
[37:35] go through it in order to get what God
[37:38] got to go got for you you got to take
[37:40] people talking about you you got to take
[37:43] people talking behind your back and
[37:45] ruining your
[37:46] reputation but it's not about your
[37:48] reputation it's about what God is doing
[37:51] behind the scenes cuz you don't know
[37:53] what God is taking up for you behind the
[37:55] scenes but if you start following up the
[37:58] foolishness start following up the mess
[38:00] you'll be right in the same place they
[38:02] are and you wonder why God ain't give
[38:05] you what you asked him
[38:06] for see but it take you getting out the
[38:09] business with God to realize that you
[38:11] know what I'm not going to follow that
[38:12] up I'm not going to go down that PA
[38:15] pathway because you there's something
[38:16] leading you on the inside to say you
[38:18] know what let me
[38:20] pray before I react let me
[38:23] pray because there's something that
[38:26] leads you and guides you but that's
[38:27] after you gotten out of business with
[38:29] God and said Lord I want you to lead me
[38:32] see the Lord won't lead you if you don't
[38:34] want him to lead you you go around in
[38:36] circle like the children of Israel in
[38:38] the wilderness but when they got down to
[38:40] business with God they could go in the
[38:41] Jordan they can get everything that God
[38:44] promised him it wasn't that God was not
[38:47] God and he didn't promise it to him he
[38:49] promised it to him and they could have
[38:50] it all they had to do was have faith and
[38:53] believe and there's a story in the Bible
[38:56] if you think about
[38:57] Moses father and and the prophet of God
[39:00] said he said that he might have prayed
[39:02] for years might have prayed for years
[39:05] because there was a prophecy that gone
[39:07] forth that after so much time they would
[39:10] be delivered after so much time they
[39:12] would be delivered but he
[39:14] said one night when amram had prayed and
[39:17] maybe for several years and had his hair
[39:20] now turning gray and no Deliverance but
[39:23] just getting worse sometimes things get
[39:26] worse even when you getting down to
[39:29] business with God that's right sometimes
[39:31] things get worse even when you on your
[39:33] knees and you praying things can get
[39:36] worse but one now night he got right
[39:39] down to business and that's how we have
[39:42] to do it get right down the business and
[39:44] he said God you promised this and we're
[39:47] looking forward to it and we see all the
[39:50] signs the signs are all here and the
[39:53] time is at hand and it's time for you to
[39:56] do something about it sometimes we
[39:59] getting to the point now if you look at
[40:01] the world that you got to get down to
[40:03] business with God cuz you don't know how
[40:06] much longer we
[40:08] have when you look at the condition of
[40:10] the world you look at the storms and if
[40:12] you don't worry about the political
[40:14] thing just look at nature amen just look
[40:17] at all the earthquakes that are
[40:19] happening over in California if you
[40:21] don't if that don't get you then look at
[40:23] the political realm and if that don't
[40:25] get you just look at the war
[40:28] and if that don't get you just read your
[40:32] Bible that's all you have to do and you
[40:34] can see it listen to the prophet of God
[40:37] and you'll understand the time and day
[40:40] that you are living in and realize that
[40:42] you know it's too it's too long it's too
[40:44] short a time to be playing around with
[40:47] your soul it's too short a time to just
[40:49] go through your dayto day and think that
[40:51] you going to rise up tomorrow morning
[40:53] and everything is still going to be okay
[40:56] tomorrow morning that the stock market
[40:58] crashed what would you
[41:00] do but see today is the day that you can
[41:03] get down to business with God and say I
[41:05] don't trust in that I don't trust in
[41:07] this I don't trust in the political
[41:09] system I don't trust in this but to know
[41:12] you know who I do trust in and that's
[41:14] God that's Jesus who's my savior who's
[41:16] the head of my life that I know that
[41:18] he's done many wonderful works for me
[41:20] that I have faith in him to trust him
[41:22] that if I can't go to the grocery store
[41:25] that food will be in my refrigerator if
[41:27] I can't go down and drive my car the gas
[41:29] will be in my tank if I can't if I don't
[41:32] have a job tomorrow God still going to
[41:34] keep my lights on see that's the god
[41:36] that you serve but you got to get on the
[41:38] business with him that it's not a new
[41:40] relationship when it comes time when you
[41:42] need them it's something that is a
[41:44] familiar relationship that you done have
[41:47] conversations with him and he knows your
[41:49] voice when you go to get down to pray
[41:52] God say oh that's my child what do you
[41:54] need it's not a new thing you know
[41:56] sometimes when when a child that you
[41:58] don't know come up and ask you for
[42:00] something you
[42:01] hesitant you're looking around with
[42:04] parents you're looking around it's it's
[42:06] a true fact cuz you trying to figure out
[42:08] is it okay to give it to them and
[42:11] sometimes you go to God and it be a new
[42:13] thing it's you ain't prayed in 6
[42:16] months but hey you ready to ask God for
[42:20] the
[42:21] impossible and he said he'll get he'll
[42:23] do the impossible because if you his
[42:25] child he will do things for you to prove
[42:28] that he's God but it shouldn't always be
[42:30] like that it shouldn't always be like
[42:33] that that the only time you go to him is
[42:35] when you need them it should be
[42:36] something that you do daily Lord just
[42:39] thank you for everything that you've
[42:41] done today Lord just thank you for
[42:43] waking me up this morning and when you
[42:45] go to sleep at night thank you for
[42:46] keeping you safe that day thank you for
[42:49] watching over me and protecting me
[42:51] because it's a familiar relationship
[42:53] it's something that he knows you and you
[42:55] know him you know when he speak to you
[42:57] and you know and you he knows when you
[42:59] come to
[43:00] him see there's something that he said
[43:04] the prophet of God said and faith is a
[43:06] victory it's the victory that overcomes
[43:09] Every curse of the devil so faith is the
[43:12] victory faith in what not faith in your
[43:15] church not faith in your Creed not faith
[43:18] in some man but faith in Jesus Christ it
[43:21] said when you climb into God by prayer
[43:24] until you see the thing conquered under
[43:26] you there's nothing that can that can
[43:28] hurt you sometimes you got to get down
[43:31] to business with God so that you know
[43:33] that God has done something amen amen
[43:36] sometimes you may leave too soon the
[43:38] presence come and you in the anointing
[43:40] and you got to stay there sometimes and
[43:43] you got to stay there and know for sure
[43:45] that God has done it you got to stay
[43:47] there until you know for sure beyond the
[43:49] shadow of a doubt not you think on not
[43:52] not something that you feel but you know
[43:55] for sure that God has done it
[43:57] see that's getting down the business
[43:59] with God that's getting down that I will
[44:01] stay here I don't M I don't care who
[44:03] sees me and who don't I don't care what
[44:06] anybody say about me I don't care how I
[44:08] react but I got to get down to business
[44:10] with God because I need him I need them
[44:13] for
[44:14] myself until I know that these way are
[44:17] offer me till I know that this situation
[44:20] is taking care of and I can walk with a
[44:22] freedom with my head hung up high that
[44:25] Lord I know that you did it for me it
[44:27] wasn't nothing that I did but I knew
[44:29] that getting out the business with you
[44:31] you've done something you changed
[44:33] something you worked it out for
[44:38] me and the prophet God said now just
[44:40] don't turn loose take a hold just just
[44:43] hold on the calvary until you're
[44:46] satisfied you get to that cross and you
[44:48] hold on until you're satisfied you don't
[44:51] let go until you satisfied if you want
[44:54] your cup to run over stay there until
[44:57] you're satisfied sometimes you don't let
[44:59] go but too soon he said that's right get
[45:02] right right down to business and when
[45:04] you get to business God will get to
[45:06] business when you get to business God
[45:10] will get to business it'll be up to
[45:14] you it'll be up to you now just claims
[45:18] those those promises to you see it's up
[45:22] to you if you want to see God really
[45:25] work it's up to you bless it's not up to
[45:28] Mama daddy sister or brother it's up to
[45:30] you all it takes is you getting down to
[45:33] business with God for things to change
[45:36] amen all it takes is your prayers for
[45:38] things to move and stuff to start
[45:40] happening all it takes is you but it's
[45:43] when you get down to business it's up to
[45:45] you it's not up to anybody else it's not
[45:47] even up to the pastor it's up to
[45:51] you cuz you never know which prayer God
[45:54] is waiting to hear to move amen you
[45:57] never know which who says the prayer
[45:59] that God is going to answer and God move
[46:01] and change for everyone around you God
[46:03] will come and move in your situation
[46:06] move on your job move in the atmosphere
[46:08] because you set a prayer God to keep
[46:10] everyone safe at school because you set
[46:13] a prayer God will watch over everything
[46:15] that you do because you said a
[46:17] prayer said it's not just good enough to
[46:20] have one person pray he said pray
[46:22] without ceasing that applies to each and
[46:25] every last one of us that's not excluded
[46:28] that I'm excluded because Mama Prayed
[46:31] I'm excluded because daddy prayed I'm
[46:34] excluded because my sister prayed no
[46:36] that's something that you got to do you
[46:38] got to get down the business because I
[46:40] tell you one thing I can't get you into
[46:42] heaven I can't my prayers can't get you
[46:45] into heaven you got to do something
[46:47] sometimes for yourself you got to look
[46:49] and get serious with God for yourself
[46:52] cuz I can't save you but he can but you
[46:55] got to go to him and say Lord save me
[46:57] Lord I'm a wretched sinner Lord Save Me
[47:00] Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost cuz
[47:02] that's what you going to need to get
[47:04] there but you got to go to him and ask
[47:06] them I can't ask him for you I can't
[47:09] open up your mouth and put words in
[47:10] there and make them come back
[47:13] out but sometimes that's what you be
[47:15] looking for you want someone to do it
[47:18] for you I come up in the prayer line and
[47:20] expect the preacher it's all going to
[47:22] happen cuz he prayed but if you ain't
[47:25] surrendered nothing going to happen if
[47:27] you ain't come down and broke in and
[47:28] said Lord do something for me ain't
[47:30] nothing going to happen they can pray
[47:32] all night and
[47:34] day but it's whether what you want it's
[47:37] whether are you ready to get down to
[47:39] business with God are you ready to
[47:41] completely surrender to him so God can
[47:44] work a work in your life see that's what
[47:46] it's about getting down the business
[47:48] with God that's something that you got
[47:50] to understand and realize that it's not
[47:53] them but it's you opening your mouth and
[47:55] say Lord I need your help it's a
[47:58] personal relationship that each and
[48:00] every one of us have to have with God
[48:03] cuz that's what it takes to get down the
[48:04] business with God God sometimes he just
[48:07] want to hear you say Lord I Need You
[48:10] Jesus and that's all it take for him to
[48:13] show up on this scene he just want to
[48:15] say Lord I need help that's all it take
[48:19] for you to him to get down on the scene
[48:22] sometimes it take you just to break down
[48:24] and cry and say Lord I can't do it no
[48:26] more
[48:27] that's all it take for him to come down
[48:29] on the scene said that's my child that's
[48:32] the one that I've been waiting on to
[48:34] finally let me in so I can take care of
[48:36] all of it but that's what getting out
[48:39] the business entails and sometimes if
[48:42] you're not ready for it and and you
[48:43] wonder why things ain't happening it's
[48:45] not cuz God ain't
[48:47] real it's because you ain't ready to let
[48:50] him take complete
[48:51] control because that's what getting out
[48:54] the business entails letting God take
[48:57] complete
[49:00] control he said oh God I believe you
[49:03] I'll never turn loose I'll stay right
[49:06] here till something happens to my soul
[49:09] sometimes you got to stay there until
[49:10] something happens down down on the
[49:12] inside that not just on your flesh
[49:15] that's not just in your heart but it's
[49:16] deep down in the soul that you know that
[49:19] God has done something you know that
[49:21] he's worked some things out that you
[49:22] ain't told nobody there sometimes you
[49:25] have situations and things in life that
[49:27] you can't tell nobody but God and and it
[49:31] only take God to deliver you from it or
[49:33] to take you through it and you got to
[49:36] get down so serious to business with God
[49:38] because if you don't you know that
[49:40] you'll deal with it for the rest of your
[49:41] life but if when you experience what God
[49:45] can do that's why you can hear some
[49:47] testimony of what God has brought
[49:49] someone through because it's only
[49:51] because they got down to business with
[49:53] God and realize that Lord I need you to
[49:55] do it for me I done tried this I done
[49:58] tried that I done tried this but today
[50:00] is the day that Lord I get serious with
[50:02] you today is the day that I surrender
[50:05] all I come before you and I said Lord I
[50:07] need help I Surrender everything and I'm
[50:10] not going another step another day
[50:13] without you doing something for me
[50:15] without you saving me without you
[50:17] filling me with the Holy Ghost see when
[50:19] you get down to business with God God to
[50:21] do some things God to start doing things
[50:23] that you didn't even think of God to
[50:25] start doing it problems that you didn't
[50:27] think you had God will show you and
[50:29] he'll take care of them for you things
[50:31] that you didn't think you was struggling
[50:33] with God will show you and he'll take
[50:35] care of them for you but you got to get
[50:37] down to business with God and say Lord I
[50:39] want you to take care of these things
[50:41] Lord I want you to do this for me Lord I
[50:43] want you to remove these things from me
[50:45] Lord I want you to heal me in this Lord
[50:48] I want you to deliver me from that
[50:50] that's what it takes to get down to
[50:51] business with God CU God is still real
[50:56] and he promised that he would be with us
[50:59] he promised that he would deliver you
[51:01] from everything that you may go through
[51:03] he promised that if you needed healing
[51:05] he would heal you cuz he already did it
[51:07] when he died on Calvary he shed his
[51:09] blood for you so all you got to do is
[51:12] believe and get down to business with
[51:13] God sometimes in the secret closet and
[51:16] God will do some things that you ask him
[51:19] for sometimes it take leaving some
[51:21] things by the wayside sometimes it take
[51:24] sacrificing things over here and leaving
[51:27] this alone and leaving that alone and
[51:29] giving up this and giving up time doing
[51:31] this and giving up time doing this and
[51:33] put your time where it truly counts on
[51:36] your knees talking to God and asking him
[51:39] to do the things that he said he would
[51:40] do am sometimes you got to reorganize
[51:44] your schedule you got to reorganize your
[51:47] schedule and if you don't have a
[51:48] schedule you got to create one to make
[51:50] sure that you got time with God to make
[51:53] sure that you done set time aside that
[51:55] Lord I got the talk to you because I got
[51:58] to get serious with you Lord I got to
[52:00] see you move Lord I got to see you do
[52:02] some things Lord Lord I want to see your
[52:05] anointing in my life Lord I want to see
[52:07] your leadership in my life I want to
[52:09] walk through the door and them know that
[52:10] it's not me but it's you God that you're
[52:13] the one and true and Only God lord I
[52:15] want to get down to business with you
[52:17] that your anointing and presence is with
[52:19] me every day I go every morning when I

[52:51] don't wake up I'm going to see the king
[52:54] I'm going to see my Lord and Savior
[52:57] see I got down to business with
[52:59] him see that's what you want to walk in
[53:01] Victory every day in your life you want
[53:04] to walk so with Jesus that you can lift
[53:07] your head up high and say and you're not
[53:09] afraid to tell nobody about Jesus you're
[53:11] not afraid to lift up your hands when
[53:13] you think of the goodness of Jesus
[53:15] you're not afraid to say Thank You Lord

[54:17] with God each and every day every day
[54:20] was a new day with new tests new trials
[54:23] new situations and he wanted God to be
[54:26] with so he got down the business each
