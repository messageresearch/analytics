[28:27] the book of Colossians
[28:30] first chapter Colossians
[28:53] Colossians 1
[28:55] .
[29:02] it's like a better reading but I'm going
[29:03] to try to skip
[29:14] started in 19 verse 1 and 19.
[29:20] for it pleased the father
[29:22] there ain't him
[29:24] should all the fullest dwell
[29:27] having made peace through the blood of
[29:30] the cross
[29:31] by him to reconcile all things unto
[29:35] themselves to bring us back
[29:38] by him I say one of the day be things in
[29:40] Earth all things in heaven
[29:43] and you that were sometime alienated and
[29:46] enemies in your mind but okay it works
[29:49] yet now hath he reconciled
[29:54] skip down
[29:55] 25th wherefore I am made a minister
[29:58] according to a disposition of God which
[30:01] was given to me for you
[30:04] to fulfill the word of God even the
[30:07] mystery which had been hid from ages and
[30:11] from generation but now is made manifest
[30:14] to his Saints to whom God will make
[30:18] known what is the riches of the glory of
[30:22] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[30:26] Christ in you the hope of glory let us
[30:31] pray
[30:31] father
[30:33] thank you for your word for your
[30:35] blessing now in Jesus name amen be
[30:38] seated
[30:45] we
[30:47] were
[30:50] taking this back
[30:56] at the church at home in Sunday school
[30:58] and I've been
[31:00] for the last two months or so or better
[31:02] now we
[31:05] were working with Christ is the mystery
[31:07] of God revealed
[31:09] but then I don't want to work with a
[31:11] little bit from a different angle we've
[31:13] been putting out little little hidden
[31:15] things out of this message here tonight
[31:17] we won't work with Christ in you
[31:21] Christ in you
[31:25] and I'm really seeing
[31:29] the importance
[31:33] I don't know to me nothing else
[31:38] is so important for
[31:42] us to get the people to Jesus Christ
[31:48] and I'm not just talking about getting
[31:51] them to what
[31:52] has been spoken by the word of the Lord
[31:57] but actually getting them to a
[32:00] relationship that God has come in
[32:07] because remember this the Bible says
[32:10] Roman if you have not the spirit of
[32:12] Christ you are never his
[32:17] and God is coming back for a people like
[32:20] himself
[32:22] people that has been sold out
[32:26] [Music]
[32:27] people that
[32:30] not uh
[32:33] forcing them but willingly
[32:36] because they understand that without
[32:39] this life of God it'll be hard for you
[32:44] to live a Christian Life
[32:48] you may go to church and you're making
[32:51] rehearse and say what he's saying and
[32:54] they're like the same but they're
[32:56] actually they're produced their life
[32:59] of God within you see
[33:03] and I'd like to say this this is not a
[33:07] group
[33:08] type thing that well you know like
[33:11] they're doing now that this church think
[33:14] that they got it all or that church
[33:16] thing this is a individual Journey with
[33:21] you and God Alone
[33:26] and that's why we can't live off of
[33:29] nobody else experience you must know him
[33:33] for yourself
[33:34] even even
[33:37] [Music]
[33:39] I was telling this trip back home I said
[33:42] you know what like I don't want to leave
[33:44] this and I probably wanting to God tells
[33:47] me
[33:48] I feel led because I see that hearing
[33:52] colossian you're talking about Christ
[33:54] was the very image of God
[33:59] you hear the word he was the fullness
[34:04] or what God was looking to express
[34:09] he was God wanted to express himself as
[34:15] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[34:18] not three person but one person
[34:23] father above us
[34:25] God used Jesus with us in the Holy Ghost
[34:28] that he's sent back the same person
[34:32] in three different manifestations
[34:37] amen
[34:40] I'm seeing this
[34:43] we
[34:45] as we call ourselves the end time people
[34:49] or
[34:50] the message of the hour
[34:53] as we identify ourself
[34:58] but if that life of God is not being
[35:01] made manifest we haven't got there yet
[35:06] we heard and we know what are was said
[35:10] that we ought to be
[35:12] but it's something that God has to
[35:16] transform our life
[35:20] and this word that we receive we must
[35:24] become the word
[35:27] nothing less
[35:29] not just church members or or message
[35:33] titles
[35:35] it must be a manifestation of God living
[35:40] in his bride
[35:45] oh my my
[35:51] understanding clearly
[35:55] more and more why the server that God
[35:57] say that Revelation to a True Believer
[36:01] means more than what you think
[36:07] not just the revelation of the Thunders
[36:11] now just a revelation of the mighty
[36:13] conqueror but he said all revelation
[36:20] it's important to the True Believer
[36:23] why is it so important because he said
[36:26] that that's what the church is to be
[36:29] built upon
[36:31] [Music]
[36:32] the revelation of who he is
[36:37] and if you notice that when Peter
[36:39] answered him nobody else answered but
[36:43] Peter
[36:45] you know but he asked them who do you
[36:47] say
[36:49] I heard the son of man in
[36:52] not and Peter stood up and and he spoke
[36:56] by inspiration
[36:58] because the Revelation must be to you as
[37:03] an individual
[37:05] and after the inspirational stuff he
[37:07] said Peter Flesh and Blood did not
[37:10] reveal this
[37:12] and see this word that God has given us
[37:17] intellectualism and uh this um I don't
[37:21] know uh what they're calling on
[37:24] Revelation
[37:27] but without a manifestation
[37:32] you can't have Christ in you and there
[37:37] ain't no power
[37:39] there ain't no manifestation
[37:42] how can you
[37:48] where the word of the king is there's
[37:50] power
[37:52] huh
[37:54] sister and brother my life in your life
[37:59] must have the same manifestation
[38:03] look what the early church had
[38:07] and we supposed to be a duplicate
[38:11] not impersonate
[38:15] but we're supposed to be a duplicate in
[38:17] other words our continuation of the book
[38:20] of Acts
[38:25] the book of Acts continue because it was
[38:29] never an organizational denomination but
[38:32] it was a moving of the Holy Ghost
[38:35] oh do we really have it like they had it
[38:39] in the Bible
[38:43] and if we do then the world be all his
[38:47] miracles
[38:50] hmm
[38:51] is there an Obama when we get in
[38:58] why then he said
[39:01] my people are not saved
[39:06] why are they not convert it
[39:10] so God said well please I'm afraid that
[39:13] we're getting the people to the church
[39:15] but we're not getting them to Christ
[39:19] and I understand we can make people get
[39:22] it
[39:24] but there has to be something in US
[39:29] that can't settle for nothing else
[39:33] nothing less
[39:36] nothing short
[39:39] of what they had Weavers have and more
[39:46] yeah I'd like to say we don't need
[39:48] Pinnacles what Pinnacle is he talking
[39:50] about
[39:51] that that same experience they had
[39:53] that's what we got to have
[39:57] and then of course but never a
[39:59] denomination it was an experience that
[40:02] they had
[40:04] and we trying to bypass the experience
[40:08] and give the people something else less
[40:11] than experience with God it'll never
[40:14] work
[40:17] no this is not our substitutes brother
[40:21] sister we need a real thing
[40:26] oh yes sir nothing less
[40:29] no time now to act it that fake it till
[40:32] you make it that won't work no more
[40:34] [Music]
[40:35] we got to get desperate and said Lord
[40:38] here am I
[40:41] not my brother not my sister we not
[40:45] looking around to this or that it's me
[40:47] and God now if you ain't gone now is
[40:51] that the church down the road
[40:54] mistake but it's me it's it's you
[41:00] Christ and you the hope of glory
[41:06] expressing himself in a bride many
[41:10] member
[41:14] sometimes I believe we get it all
[41:17] because we uh you know
[41:20] because we go to certain churches and
[41:23] they feel they are they leak
[41:26] that don't work
[41:29] no God is only Elite
[41:31] [Music]
[41:33] it doesn't matter what church you
[41:34] remember of you better be a member of
[41:36] the real Church
[41:38] and that shirt you can't join
[41:41] that shirt you can't say well this is
[41:44] that no one body
[41:47] and who they had rice
[41:51] either head
[41:55] let me read this
[42:03] um
[42:04] 18. and he holy is the head of the body
[42:10] the church
[42:12] who is the beginning
[42:14] they're first born from the dead that in
[42:18] all things
[42:19] he might have
[42:21] preeminence
[42:24] that's what God wants to do
[42:27] that message he was saying that God had
[42:29] a free full purpose
[42:32] God wanted to reveal himself to the
[42:35] people
[42:37] God wanted to live in the people and
[42:41] have preeminence
[42:43] in other words God wants a church and he
[42:47] can lead by his spirit
[42:50] and not a people trying to lead God but
[42:53] God leading us
[42:55] we don't tell him what to do but he tell
[42:58] us what to do
[43:00] [Music]
[43:01] and wherever he leads you Lord I'll
[43:05] follow
[43:05] [Music]
[43:08] yes
[43:10] come back to the real headship
[43:13] Bible said they that are led by the
[43:15] spirit of God
[43:17] they are
[43:20] the sons of God
[43:22] [Music]
[43:23] Sergo is saying God hardest problem he
[43:26] had of doing is to get in the people
[43:30] they get the preeminence that God is is
[43:34] the one uh in control you're not in
[43:37] control of your life
[43:38] that you've been bought with a price
[43:42] and you can't Paul saying I am a
[43:45] prisoner
[43:48] you see God looking for prisoners
[43:52] one that can't do what they want
[43:56] one that don't think like they think you
[44:00] think like God because why you have the
[44:02] mind of God
[44:04] in the mind of God always in the word of
[44:07] God
[44:09] God mine don't lead you away from the
[44:11] word
[44:12] but he leads you to the word
[44:15] and what you and I doing is according to
[44:19] the word of the Lord did God said I am a
[44:23] well pleased
[44:25] about to get their people to submit I
[44:27] was scene of the Sunday total
[44:31] surrendering
[44:34] giving your life completely over to him
[44:36] and let him manage your life because I
[44:40] was saying that
[44:41] we as human we are self-destructed
[44:44] within ourself
[44:47] but sometimes I don't even know it that
[44:48] we killing our own self but God came to
[44:52] give us the right direction
[44:55] the whole purpose of this message God
[44:58] sent is to take us back
[45:01] and he was saying here that God will
[45:03] reconcile us God had a purpose you know
[45:06] on what all that is all down from
[45:09] Genesis all through he said God was
[45:11] expressing himself in Moses in Abraham
[45:14] in Jeremiah he was expressing himself
[45:17] but through Jesus Christ he wanted the
[45:21] fullness
[45:23] and that's why I'm glad it's our God is
[45:25] not looking for partiality
[45:28] girls are looking for part-time
[45:30] Christian but God looking for people
[45:32] that's going to be devoted to him and
[45:36] him alone
[45:37] people that are going to be led by his
[45:40] Spirit he went down to gonna know what
[45:43] they ought to do and it's our why
[45:45] because God speaks and they follow the
[45:48] leading of God
[45:50] he said my sheep
[45:53] know my voice
[45:55] you ought to know the voice of God
[45:58] the voice of God always have you to the
[46:02] word
[46:07] oh my
[46:10] God I don't know
[46:12] your mother Go and sing I don't know
[46:14] what you come to do
[46:18] but I'll come to do something
[46:21] he's looking for well
[46:23] you know when time pass how people do
[46:25] they
[46:26] always you know like to say I you know
[46:30] the terminologies we use
[46:33] and sometimes that's what it'd be be
[46:35] terminologies
[46:37] but we don't need this terminology we
[46:40] need realities of what God promised to
[46:42] do in his hour
[46:44] and you will the people that God wants
[46:46] to use
[46:48] don't look to Peter and those anymore no
[46:51] you are Ricky pistols
[46:55] we're supposed to be written not with
[46:57] ache but I'm a very life yeah
[47:01] he said I'm a very action or reflect him
[47:04] [Music]
[47:07] all of our action what we do how we live
[47:10] it ought to reflect Christ
[47:13] the biggest problem we have is people
[47:16] living Devil's standard lies
[47:18] professional one thing but not you know
[47:20] bringing forth any fruits
[47:23] but if that seed is correctly planted
[47:26] into the right ground it ought to bring
[47:29] forth fruits
[47:31] okay
[47:34] oh my
[47:36] look Romans
[47:40] you know pray for me
[47:43] I said Lord help us
[47:46] I realize in an hour
[47:49] and I tell it's romansly
[47:53] I believe it's the eighth chapter yes
[47:56] I was telling the truth I said there's
[47:58] no time now to play
[48:01] there's no time to act like we got
[48:03] something we don't have
[48:06] but I said we don't have it we should
[48:08] everybody get busy and get it
[48:10] it's an urgency that you must get it you
[48:15] must have the Holy Ghost
[48:16] [Music]
[48:17] there is nothing else that you you can't
[48:19] play around to learn the thing that was
[48:23] quoted to learn things when he said but
[48:25] he said uh the most greatest thing we
[48:28] need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:31] [Music]
[48:32] it's a urgent that we get the people
[48:36] back to the Holy Ghost
[48:40] because if the Holy Ghost says don't
[48:42] come and Lead You somebody else will
[48:44] lead you
[48:45] [Music]
[48:48] sometimes people want to pass the whole
[48:51] time to tell you what to do but the Holy
[48:53] Ghost want to tell you
[48:56] yes he leads you to it he leads you but
[49:00] you don't understand this I'm
[49:02] understanding this you can't lead those
[49:07] sheeps
[49:10] and sheets are humble
[49:14] sheep don't fight back
[49:17] sheets know they must be led
[49:21] and Jesus Christ is a bishop and a
[49:23] shepherd of our soul you see God who
[49:26] raises up man who's fully under the
[49:28] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[49:31] he's saying that man under the
[49:33] inspiration of the Holy Ghost is not so
[49:36] much here by this God in the man
[49:40] what is he doing and giving you
[49:42] instructions he's giving you the things
[49:44] that God is requiring of you
[49:50] because if you don't then the blood
[49:52] gonna be on his hand
[49:55] as I was thinking
[49:58] the other day for the siblings I was
[50:00] just thinking
[50:02] I said you know I always reflect back
[50:06] our only Christian walk
[50:09] and I remember
[50:11] way back in 1989
[50:14] that had been first met with the Simmons
[50:19] came there and
[50:21] Brother Gibson Brother Isaiah
[50:24] different ones
[50:26] came and labored
[50:29] and I'll never forget
[50:32] and I can't even remember today
[50:35] as I look
[50:37] I see you know one of the important
[50:39] things that I saw that he always did
[50:43] and that wasn't trying to get the people
[50:45] to the Holy Ghost
[50:48] there were people flying high and
[50:50] jumping high jumping out the window
[50:52] jumping through the roofs
[50:55] about this and about that
[50:57] but he stayed right there you must be
[51:00] born again
[51:03] and I'm trying to say why he ain't
[51:05] preaching like everybody else
[51:07] why him preaching it deep you know
[51:10] things way up in heaven
[51:12] what for you need something on Earth
[51:16] and he was trying to settle the people
[51:18] into something that's going to take them
[51:21] in heaven
[51:24] and I saw over the years and I saw even
[51:27] in my life I saw the things that it was
[51:30] done and how God took us from one place
[51:33] to another but I I saw that he stayed
[51:36] with that same teaching you've got to
[51:41] have it same teaching you may know all
[51:45] the things that the servant of God said
[51:47] from 48 even the 65 but if you don't
[51:51] have that life
[51:57] experience with God in you and then you
[52:01] got a revelation of a word
[52:04] then you building your house from the
[52:07] top of God and you ain't got the bottom
[52:10] right
[52:12] and when that Foundation ain't right the
[52:15] top won't stand
[52:17] and that's what a lot why so many have
[52:20] gone back
[52:23] why because the foundation
[52:27] and Paul said I laid the phone got the
[52:30] bottom right you must have when there's
[52:33] holidays Foundation what are we building
[52:36] on
[52:37] and that's what a lot why so many what
[52:39] have he built the people off you could
[52:42] introduce when that why why are the
[52:44] people still struggling we're living our
[52:47] holy life the foundation
[52:52] what are we building on to live holy to
[52:56] live clean why do we build the people on
[52:58] but yet they've been around the message
[53:00] 15 18 20 years we're living a holy life
[53:04] something is wrong
[53:08] and see what's going on now
[53:41] when you grow up
[53:53] because you don't want no trouble with
[53:54] that Foundation is right
[53:58] upon a rock
[54:01] you start losing building upon a
[54:03] revelation
[54:04] of Jesus Foundation is right
[54:07] and you know where you're standing upon
[54:09] a rock you know where you at Romans 8
[54:12] building upon the revelation
[54:15] but if Christ and you know where you're
[54:18] standing be in you notice you know where
[54:20] you're at Romans 8 if Christ beware 10
[54:24] 11 he said the body is what
[54:27] because of sin notice but the spirit of
[54:30] life because of righteousness see the
[54:33] body we've got to die because of sin
[54:37] but a spirit of life because that's the
[54:39] problem we don't want to die we got to
[54:41] die
[54:44] we want to do what I want that's the
[54:46] problem we don't want to die excuse me I
[54:48] had the same problem me marrying we want
[54:51] to do what that's why I hope when the
[54:52] people don't think coming to church is
[54:53] important as me I had the same problem
[54:55] with me marrying and they miss us
[54:58] is important
[55:07] lead you to church
[55:11] God lead you he'll lead you to church
[55:13] which is more important pick you up for
[55:15] work
[55:17] which is more important used to be
[55:20] overtime weird and allow that we
[55:22] wouldn't do that now and the Bible says
[55:25] sister
[55:27] now go back
[55:30] now people go back because the Lord
[55:33] ain't coming yet because the law didn't
[55:35] come in yet
[55:36] oh
[55:37] look like old things ain't right yet so
[55:40] things ain't right let's go back let's
[55:42] go back and let's work let's get well
[55:45] let's get wet let's get rich
[55:48] don't know what you ritualize the word
[55:53] the real remember the Bible said that
[55:55] everything was created by Him and for
[55:59] him
[56:01] everything was created by Him in foreign
[56:13] I'm sorry
[56:15] I can never get away from that you say
[56:17] seek ye first
[56:21] the kingdom of God
[56:23] I still believe that it ought to be
[56:25] first
[56:27] God wants to be first
[56:31] God ain't gonna accept nothing else but
[56:34] first place
[56:36] that don't mean that you not say it but
[56:37] it means that you got to come up
[56:41] I believe it's time for us to come up
[56:43] hither
[56:45] I'll be a member of the sermon he spoke
[56:47] along the way he said you know let's go
[56:49] on
[56:50] you man it's time to leave the
[56:53] principles of the doctors kind and leave
[56:55] teaching but we need meat
[56:59] this is the hour
[57:01] and we need something to come back the
[57:04] devil
[57:06] and if y'all see and I see it we know
[57:08] that the devil is Raging
[57:11] we know that oh my God
[57:16] angel in the land every time you look
[57:19] around somebody
[57:23] I said Lord how are we ever going to
[57:27] make it this doing what we're doing we
[57:29] got to have more every time you look
[57:31] around we got to do more about it
[57:36] come
[57:45] God is calling us to
[57:51] be okay
[57:53] we got to do more
[57:57] but I understand
[58:00] so ever will let God was in Christ
[58:05] God is calling Christ is in you
[58:09] that's what I'm saying one or two things
[58:10] I did through Christ Christ want to do
[58:13] it through the bride
[58:16] let's go up into Saint John as coaching
[58:20] God was in Christ what God did through
[58:23] Christ
[58:28] did something through the bride he just
[58:32] said come and sit around and say well
[58:33] Saint John I'm Godly no flesh and
[58:36] y'all know it uh to be the truth
[58:40] no he went by doing something Christ did
[58:44] something I always said God never called
[58:47] people so they come and sit around and
[58:48] say well if God call you there's
[58:51] something you must do know it uh to be
[58:53] the truth and there is something one of
[58:57] us God's give to do I always say God
[59:00] save you he called you for his purpose
[59:04] God call you there's something you must
[59:05] do and God want to get Glory out of your
[59:09] life one of us God give he wants you to
[59:12] be a lighthouse he saved you he called
[59:15] you for a lighthouse with power
[59:23] that house
[59:26] and if the right connection there he'll
[59:29] produce power you know before uh he said
[59:32] let him down below your connection to it
[59:35] life had to come and it's the right
[59:38] connection there it'll produce wild
[59:40] because God's spoken word
[59:45] when he speak them it must happen why
[59:49] because God's spoken word is the
[59:52] Original Seed
[59:54] when he speaks it must happen
[59:58] Saint John 14.

[1:01:18] Highway music
[1:01:25] the world

[1:01:29] but we see him because he is within you
[1:01:35] what is he doing in you
[1:01:39] what is Christ doing in you
[1:01:47] battles in one place that these signs
[1:01:51] shall
[1:01:52] follow them
[1:01:56] oh yes please if God is in you the signs
[1:02:00] in the Wonders got to follow
[1:02:03] how can it not
[1:02:06] you have the Zoey life oh God I don't
[1:02:09] mean to go around this you know doing
[1:02:11] this no but God will lead you
[1:02:16] what we have is is is not some weak
[1:02:20] uh things that we just quoting
[1:02:25] but there's a very manifestation that
[1:02:28] God is looking for his bride to come
[1:02:31] into His image
[1:02:37] our word ought to be his words
[1:02:41] under the inspiration God will he'll
[1:02:44] tell you what to speak
[1:02:49] yes
[1:02:51] you have to wait for an angel to come
[1:02:53] down you got the commission of the word
[1:02:57] the word say if it is sick lay hands on
[1:03:01] the sick
[1:03:04] don't you know they were even doing that
[1:03:06] before the holy ghost game
[1:03:10] he told disciple one place he should go
[1:03:12] and cast out devils
[1:03:15] if they could do that before the Holy
[1:03:18] Ghost come how much more we ought to be
[1:03:21] doing with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:26] oh yeah there's one little working power
[1:03:31] honestly he gave him a name
[1:03:33] that's highly exhorted above every name
[1:03:38] you let that name every devil shrimple
[1:03:43] he's a day that named him the Lord
[1:03:45] depart from iniquity
[1:03:47] Jesus come with a life lived
[1:03:50] and you're walking
[1:03:52] circumspectly in the light of the word
[1:03:55] that God gave you we're not just talking
[1:03:58] about it but we say Lord let my life
[1:04:01] reflect
[1:04:03] what I believe would be the truth
[1:04:07] see these honest it is what God has
[1:04:11] given us
[1:04:15] oh my sir because if you want please say
[1:04:18] I believe he said we are living to below
[1:04:21] our Christian privileges
[1:04:24] he said we living to below it
[1:04:28] he said the church ought to be a million
[1:04:30] mile up the road
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:34] but he said we're stumbling around
[1:04:37] fumbling around and fussing and this and
[1:04:41] doing everything else except what's God
[1:04:43] but intend for us to do
[1:04:47] Lord
[1:04:58] that will arise to the occasions
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:03] they will do explore
[1:05:07] not them but the Holy Ghost in them
[1:05:11] we'll begin to lead them and if they'll
[1:05:15] begin to be moving such a way with God
[1:05:18] such a way when God you and people will
[1:05:22] be thinking what do they think they're
[1:05:23] doing no and it's not them but it's God
[1:05:27] in them because they gave up their life
[1:05:31] and they became a prison
[1:05:34] they don't want to do what they want in
[1:05:36] the morning we can't afford to them we
[1:05:40] want to make every step count now we
[1:05:43] know we're just going in vain or I'm
[1:05:45] going no they got to be
[1:05:48] if you don't have a real purpose why are
[1:05:50] you going
[1:05:52] to do we can't just go because we want
[1:05:56] to go we want to go because there's a
[1:05:59] leading to go there's a mouse
[1:06:06] said no go ahead if you don't have a
[1:06:09] real purpose why are you going way out
[1:06:11] of your plan see God don't want your
[1:06:14] plan
[1:06:16] we want to go because yeah no
[1:06:27] and I believe this every one of us must
[1:06:31] need to follow the leadership of the
[1:06:33] Holy Ghost
[1:06:35] you must be led by God yourself
[1:06:42] I serve to God here
[1:06:45] he said Jesus said at that day
[1:06:49] he said that's this thing
[1:06:52] at that day when this Revelation is made
[1:06:56] known
[1:06:57] you will know that I am in the father
[1:07:01] and the father in me are in you and you
[1:07:06] in me
[1:07:07] when the Revelation is made manifest at
[1:07:11] that day
[1:07:12] ye shall know that I am in the father
[1:07:16] are one I am in the Father the father is
[1:07:20] in me then when the Revelation come
[1:07:22] forth then it's I in you and you in me
[1:07:27] there you are see the manifold the
[1:07:29] threefold manifestation what for to
[1:07:32] bring it back we've got to be there
[1:07:35] as Jesus was the word of God he
[1:07:38] Vindicated the same
[1:07:40] if he wasn't the word he wouldn't have
[1:07:43] made manifest the word he has to be in
[1:07:46] some great Theologian that have been the
[1:07:49] real Messiah the world was looking for a
[1:07:52] see yes sir that would have been him
[1:07:54] that's what they're looking for today
[1:08:00] some great man
[1:08:03] God looking for the manifestation
[1:08:06] of his word
[1:08:08] he's looking for a people that's going
[1:08:11] to take hold
[1:08:14] quickening power the Bible said one
[1:08:16] place that the letter killeth
[1:08:19] we need the spirit
[1:08:23] we need the spirit to bring forth life
[1:08:27] and the people need that Spirit the life
[1:08:31] to come forth
[1:08:36] we need the Dynamics
[1:08:39] we need we got to have the power of God
[1:08:43] you can't live without it
[1:08:47] you said well the pastor got it that's
[1:08:49] him how about you
[1:08:52] you need your own power
[1:08:56] yes you need your own
[1:08:59] you need to know that the resurrection
[1:09:02] is in you
[1:09:08] I thought about speaking something in
[1:09:10] the church there after the resurrection
[1:09:13] what happened
[1:09:16] we know what happened but after the
[1:09:18] resurrection
[1:09:21] look at the early church no wonder you
[1:09:23] say now go to Jerusalem
[1:09:26] and he said wait there
[1:09:30] don't go don't go preach nowhere go
[1:09:33] there and wait till I sin you something
[1:09:37] and when he come
[1:09:40] when he come
[1:09:43] he said he'll testify of me
[1:09:47] and when it came at Pentecost
[1:09:51] Peter that line Peter that those people
[1:09:54] that was frightful when the Holy Ghost
[1:09:56] came
[1:09:58] power for more High
[1:10:01] brother did we in that house
[1:10:04] waiting waiting on what God Said wait
[1:10:10] sometime when you praying for something
[1:10:12] you move too fast wait
[1:10:16] wait till he come
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:19] and when he came that day sister and
[1:10:22] brother they went out that house like
[1:10:25] drunk man
[1:10:27] there were no more cows
[1:10:30] they were willing to give their life for
[1:10:33] what they preach
[1:10:35] they went about the city turning it
[1:10:38] upside down everywhere they go something
[1:10:41] was happening
[1:10:43] why because they had something
[1:10:47] but until you get something
[1:10:49] going to happen
[1:10:52] but when you get something
[1:10:54] the devil know you even got it
[1:10:58] the problem with us
[1:11:00] we don't know what we got
[1:11:03] because sometimes I mean you have a lot
[1:11:05] you know you'd be wasteful
[1:11:08] but when you understand what you have
[1:11:10] you cherish it
