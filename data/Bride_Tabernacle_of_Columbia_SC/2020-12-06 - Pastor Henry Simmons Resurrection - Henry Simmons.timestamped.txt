[34:25] jesus name
[34:27] amen
[34:31] saint john
[34:34] 11 25
[34:38] i just read the 24th verse
[34:45] saint john 11 24
[34:48] marta said unto him
[34:53] i know he shall rise again in the
[34:55] resurrection at the last day
[34:58] jesus said i am the resurrection and the
[35:01] life he that believeth in me
[35:03] though you were dead yet shall he live
[35:05] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[35:08] shall never die believeth thou
[35:11] this god bless you reading his word you
[35:14] may be seated
[35:19] the bible tells us the last enemy that
[35:21] shall be destroyed is death
[35:26] so death seems to be
[35:30] our enemy
[35:33] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[35:35] is death
[35:39] but we want to talk about resurrection
[35:44] jesus talked about he that believeth in
[35:46] me though you were dead you actually
[35:47] live and whosoever liveth and believeth
[35:50] in me shall never die
[35:54] i want to talk about the resurrection
[35:55] this morning
[35:58] because that is our hope
[36:02] but to be resurrected in the event of a
[36:05] resurrection you must have the
[36:06] resurrector
[36:07] inside
[36:11] so we're looking forward to the event
[36:12] they call the rapture
[36:14] amen the resurrection we're looking
[36:17] forward to the event
[36:19] but without the resurrector
[36:24] then we don't have resurrection
[36:28] but jesus declared that i am not just
[36:32] an event i am the person
[36:36] so the resurrection is not just an event
[36:38] it is also
[36:40] a person and that person
[36:43] jesus identifies himself as being the
[36:46] resurrection
[36:48] for i am the resurrection
[36:52] so in order to be in the resurrection
[36:57] in order to be in the rapture then the
[37:00] rapture
[37:01] amen must be in you
[37:05] are you with me now
[37:11] the bible tells us in ecclesiastes
[37:15] that which has been is now
[37:18] and that which is a b is already man
[37:22] and god requires that which is past
[37:25] and that there is nothing new under the
[37:28] sun
[37:30] are you with me so we have the event of
[37:34] a rapture as
[37:36] one that was translated named enoch
[37:41] we had another event that elijah was
[37:43] taking up in the
[37:45] fiery chariot
[37:48] and then we had jesus the resurrector
[37:54] amen he said no man take my life i laid
[37:57] down and i got the power
[37:59] to take it up again
[38:02] amen and he told them in saint luke 24
[38:06] after he had rose from the dead he said
[38:08] thus it had written
[38:10] and does it be who christ the suffering
[38:12] the rise from the dead
[38:14] the third day and that repentance and
[38:17] remission of sin shall be preached in
[38:19] his name beginning at jerusalem
[38:21] are you with me so
[38:25] we understand that he said but i want
[38:28] you to tarry ye
[38:29] in the city of jerusalem and wait there
[38:32] until you be endured with
[38:33] power from on high the church without
[38:37] the power
[38:38] is with a church without the
[38:40] resurrection
[38:43] and in the future without the power amen
[38:47] does not have the resurrection
[38:50] many folks are are inclined to believe
[38:54] that
[38:55] somehow they'll be in the rapture
[38:58] in the resurrection because they meant
[39:01] they're simply
[39:03] they made believers in christ
[39:08] now many people thought because
[39:11] they were god chosen people and they
[39:13] came out of egypt
[39:15] that they had access to the promised
[39:17] land it was a promise
[39:20] to abraham eisen and jacob but there
[39:23] many people that came out of egypt that
[39:25] never made it to the promised land
[39:28] and there are many people that accept
[39:30] that jesus christ will never
[39:32] be in the rapture
[39:36] or you appear because
[39:39] the bible said because of unbelief
[39:42] they did not enter in
[39:46] we got the continuity amen to believe
[39:50] and follow god's instructions
[39:54] all the way until the chains come
[39:59] amen we cannot stop until we reach our
[40:03] final destination
[40:07] and if we got heaven on our mind
[40:10] then we got to keep pressing
[40:14] as they told the prophet beyond the
[40:16] curse of time keep pressing on
[40:19] amen keep pressing on we got to keep
[40:21] pressing

[47:24] personal personal
[47:27] amen you know i in connection this
[47:31] morning
[47:32] i thought i i i would just let you know
[47:34] that the resurrection has a voice
[47:40] and something about the voice
[47:44] of his thunder
[47:47] amen the secret of thunder
[47:52] the resurrection has a voice and divorce
[47:55] is associated
[47:56] uh with thunder the voice of
[47:59] resurrection is associated with the
[48:02] thunder
[48:03] the bible says when he
[48:06] uh called ladders up from the grave
[48:10] he said he cried with a loud voice as
[48:13] though it thundered
[48:15] are you what man the bible says in
[48:18] revelation 10
[48:19] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[48:21] i was about to write
[48:22] and he said seal up the sand with the
[48:25] seven thunders other than write them not
[48:26] but in the days of the voice
[48:29] the bible says in the lord himself your
[48:32] descent from heaven with the shard and
[48:33] with the voice
[48:35] of an archangel amen
[48:38] so the voice of god must speak to you
[48:42] in order for you to be a part of the
[48:44] resurrection you must hear the voice
[48:48] certainly joel said he'll call and i'll
[48:50] answer
[48:52] you must hear god's voice as an
[48:54] individual personally
[48:55] because it is the voice of the
[48:57] resurrection that called ladders from
[48:59] the dead
[48:59] that same voice must cause you from the
[49:02] dead
[49:04] amen that's why he said in ephesians 2
[49:07] you who were dead in crutch christ and
[49:09] sin
[49:10] has a quickened amen made alive
[49:15] amen zika saw the valley of the dry
[49:18] bones and he said
[49:19] amen the spirit of the lord took me out
[49:21] into a valley
[49:22] and it was full of bones and he said son
[49:24] of man can these bones live
[49:27] and he said lord god i know it
[49:31] he said prophesy to the bones and say ye
[49:35] all your dry bones hear the word of the
[49:38] lord
[49:39] i wonder if anybody hearing
[49:42] amen can anybody hear the word of the
[49:45] lord
[49:46] praise god one day amen my bones were
[49:49] dry
[49:50] and i was hopeless but i heard the voice
[49:55] the voice of the resurrection that spoke
[49:57] to me
[49:59] you and i must hear the voice of the
[50:02] resurrection we must hear
[50:04] god personally speak to you
[50:08] praise god you must be certain that it
[50:11] is god that's speaking
[50:13] amen it's not the preaching in the
[50:16] pulpit but it's the voice of god
[50:20] amen it's not amen william brown i'm
[50:23] just speaking but it's the voice of god
[50:27] it's not uh brother simmers they're
[50:29] speaking but it's the voice of god

[50:51] me
[50:51] shall never die where how many you want
[50:55] to live forever
[50:59] you'll never die
[51:02] amen you'll never die praise god
[51:06] amen oh lord i can't die now
[51:11] somebody said i i done died one time
[51:15] and i don't have to die no more praise
[51:18] god i
[51:19] died and died one time oh
[51:22] thank god that oh god you be
[51:25] dead with christ amen praise god
[51:29] i thank god that a death got to take
[51:31] place
[51:32] in order for a resurrection to take
[51:34] place okay
[51:37] praise god if you expect resurrection
[51:39] then you've got to die first
[51:42] because in order to have resurrection
[51:44] then something got to be dead
[51:46] praise god and you must die to yourself
[51:51] amen if if
[51:54] death would take you to a better
[51:57] condition and
[51:58] give you a better body would you trade
[52:02] this life for a better one
[52:04] for eternal life will you lose this one
[52:07] amen that you might find a better
[52:11] amen the bible said that this earthly
[52:14] house of this tabernacle word is all
[52:16] oh we have a building a house not made
[52:19] at hand
[52:21] eternal in the heavens do you want a

[52:32] is
[52:32] that's what god got a body
[52:36] hallelujah not a temporal but an eternal
[52:41] hallelujah for the things that are seen
[52:44] a temporal
[52:46] but the things that are not seen those
[52:48] things are eternal
[52:50] faith is the substance of things hopeful
[52:52] in the evidence of things not seen
[52:55] you are the seed of abraham by faith
[52:58] so you are resurrected the invisible has
[53:01] been made visible to you
[53:02] by the power of the holy ghost you say
[53:05] those things that ought to be
[53:10] hallelujah what do you see amen those
[53:13] things that are revealed to you by the
[53:15] spirit
[53:16] amen if our eyes have not seen here have
[53:19] not heard
[53:20] neither have entered into the heart of
[53:21] man the things that god has prepared
[53:24] for them that love him amen but their
[53:28] things are being revealed to you by the
[53:30] spirit
[53:32] amen what eyes cannot see earth cannot
[53:35] hear
[53:36] but by the holy ghost god will make
[53:39] known to you
[53:41] the mysteries of his will amen i'm so
[53:45] glad
[53:46] that there is something they meant that
[53:49] god
[53:51] does with our hearts praise god our
[53:54] hearts need to be washed
[53:56] amen we need to be clean it needs to be
[54:00] purified
[54:01] and god would take it amen
[54:04] david said wash me with his ship
[54:07] that i might be made clean
[54:10] god can take a amen a heart amen that is
[54:14] filthy and dirty
[54:16] and god can wash you god bless you
[54:20] romans here for it says therefore
[54:24] we are buried with him by baptism
[54:27] unto what for unto death
[54:30] for romans 6 and 4 we're buried with him
[54:33] by baptism unto death
[54:35] see when you're baptized in water
[54:40] in the name of jesus christ
[54:44] that's why you don't be sprinkled
[54:47] when you're baptized in water in the
[54:50] name of jesus christ
[54:51] you're baptized unto death
[54:55] and not only it describes deficits
[54:58] here he says we shall
[55:02] also be in the likeness of his what
[55:07] resurrection excuse me no i skipped over
[55:11] okay we're baptized into his death that
[55:14] like as christ was raised from the dead
[55:18] by the glory of the father even so we
[55:21] also shall walk in what
[55:24] come on somebody if you're not
[55:27] living the life
[55:31] then it's something about the baptism of
[55:33] the holy ghost and the baptism of the
[55:35] lord in jesus christ's name
[55:37] something about what you're missing out
[55:39] on
[55:42] if you still got your same filthy and
[55:44] dirty desires
[55:47] if your heart is still dirty and filthy
[55:51] and you still desire the things of this
[55:53] world
[55:55] then you have not died yet
[55:59] to die is to accept what jesus paid
[56:03] the price for amen he died that you
[56:07] might not have
[56:08] that you can live okay
[56:12] i gotta close here in a minute
[56:16] let me read the next verse but because
[56:17] you might miss that that verse but don't
[56:20] miss this one
[56:22] okay for if we have been planted
[56:24] together in the likeness of his what
[56:27] okay some people just play in church
[56:31] they come to church
[56:32] but they died yet and they don't want to
[56:34] die
[56:35] you know the prophet god said about the
[56:37] lunatic man that was
[56:39] beating up all the preachers and and he
[56:41] fell at his feet
[56:44] he was breaking preachers noses and
[56:47] beating them up
[56:49] and the prophet rose about 120 pounds
[56:52] and the man was six feet something
[56:55] all the preachers about 100 preachers on
[56:57] the pulpit they weren't running
[57:00] the man come up and say i'll show you he
[57:03] said you'll fall over my feet
[57:06] that man come up down and he thought he
[57:08] was going to hit him
[57:09] and when he got the rail back to hit him
[57:12] he fell down
[57:13] under the anointing and they had some
[57:16] officers
[57:18] in the audience because there was
[57:19] thousands of people there and they came
[57:21] up to say is he dead
[57:23] and he said no they say is he healed
[57:26] he said no he said what's the bible he
[57:29] said
[57:30] he loved that spirit
[57:33] see you got to get out of love with the
[57:35] world and the things of the world
[57:37] long as you love the world the love of
[57:39] the father is what
[57:41] not in you it's a lot of people love
[57:44] what they're doing you can't stop them
[57:46] from doing what they're doing
[57:48] until god bring conviction in their
[57:50] heart a lot of folk
[57:52] love what they're doing
[57:55] they love sinning
[57:58] and they love being a sinner
[58:01] but when you love god amen
[58:04] [Music]
[58:07] you got to fall in love with god are you
[58:09] with me
[58:10] and when you fall in love with god god
[58:12] takes
[58:13] your sins away your desires
[58:16] change your nature change
[58:20] you want to live for god now are you
[58:22] with me
[58:24] so most people you know until god
[58:27] changed that nature
[58:29] changes your heart changes your desire
[58:31] but before he can do that you got to
[58:33] hear
[58:34] god my sheep know my voice
[58:39] amen and that voice is the voice of the
[58:41] resurrection
[58:43] that voice that said prophesied to the
[58:45] bones can these moans live
[58:48] and ezekiel began to prophesy to the
[58:50] bones god does that for our lives
[58:53] when we're dead in our sins jesus said
[58:57] come to me all you the labor and heaven
[58:58] late and i'll give you rest
[59:02] it doesn't matter how many times we go
[59:04] to the motion
[59:05] when we go to the motion and nothing
[59:07] happens in our lives there's no change
[59:09] made
[59:10] there's no uh new creature come forth
[59:13] there's no new life come forth all we

[1:05:48] and you said you need to put away this
[1:05:50] and put away that
[1:05:51] and you kept on ignoring the voice
[1:05:56] are you with me
[1:06:01] praise god it's just like the man that
[1:06:06] was out prospecting and he found gold
[1:06:08] and he was on his way back
[1:06:10] amen with all his gold and he had a dog
[1:06:13] that was
[1:06:14] with him and the
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:17] was dog and barking
[1:06:20] and he was trying to sleep
[1:06:23] he's on his way back to make his claim
[1:06:25] and he was going to be rich and thinking
[1:06:27] on his riches
[1:06:29] and he was tired of the dog barking
[1:06:32] and he he said well he told the dog to
[1:06:36] shut up the dog
[1:06:37] barking trying to warn him
[1:06:41] so i'm tired of the dog shut up
[1:06:46] and sort of what happened the prospect
[1:06:49] of his good friend the dog
[1:06:53] has been his buddy all the time he took

[1:07:02] the dog was trying to tell him there was
[1:07:04] somebody following him
[1:07:05] and trying to warn him
[1:07:09] but instead of him listening to the dog
[1:07:13] and that's what the voice of god he's
[1:07:15] trying to warn you
[1:07:17] don't kill the voice that's trying to
[1:07:19] warn you speaking to you
[1:07:21] every time you go do this and do that
[1:07:23] and go this way that way that voice
