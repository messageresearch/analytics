[45:15] steadfast in faith knowing that the same
[45:18] afflictions are accomplished in your
[45:20] brethren that are in the world but the

[45:41] I like that the God of all Grace amen
[45:45] you know tonight I just wanted to talk
[45:47] to you just a little bit about Grace
[45:49] amen you know I was thinking about you
[45:52] know the present trials and stuff and I
[45:53] says you know it's the grace of God Amen
[45:57] God's grace and his Mercy says a lot of
[46:00] times you know uh uh you know God's you
[46:03] got we got to realize God cares about us
[46:06] amen God cares the things you think
[46:09] about God don't care about God cares
[46:12] amen God cares about your well-being see
[46:15] see the devil don't care about
[46:18] you the devil don't care about you the
[46:21] devil desired all us be in pain and hurt
[46:24] and killed or whatever the devil is not
[46:27] your friend on no circumstance you know
[46:30] the Bible says that he's like a roaring
[46:32] lion seeking whom he may devour but one
[46:35] thing about you and I we've got the
[46:37] grace of God With Us when the devil
[46:40] desire to do all kind of things and harm
[46:43] you the grace of God is with you and one
[46:46] thing about that Grace you know that
[46:48] Grace like we said is it's it's an unmar
[46:50] favor is undeserved amen is is which you
[46:54] know it's a gift of like it say a virtue
[46:57] from God and it can't be
[47:00] earned one thing about the grace of God
[47:02] it can't be earned God loves you just
[47:05] because he he desired to love you just
[47:08] by election God chose you Hallelujah and
[47:12] the thing about it is the devil mad with
[47:15] the choice that God made but one thing
[47:17] about it you know that's why we can't be
[47:19] puffed up and Bragg and all that only
[47:21] thing we can do is just give God the
[47:23] glory and thank God for saving us and
[47:26] choosing us out of all that he could
[47:29] have chosen right you think about that
[47:32] tonight I say sometimes I don't know why
[47:35] God loves me the way he does I don't
[47:37] know why God cares and all the times we
[47:39] fall come uh fall shorts of shortcomings
[47:43] and all that but God still he's his
[47:45] grace is unmar his love is unmar his
[47:48] Mercy is always there with you all the
[47:51] time and then what does that do
[47:54] sometimes as individuals we take the
[47:56] grace of God for granted come on we take
[48:00] his love and all that for granted but
[48:02] one thing about it even in his grace and
[48:03] his Mercy he's longsuffering with us and
[48:07] I thank God for that but you know what I
[48:09] says what happens in our lives the
[48:12] trials and the things and all that God
[48:14] bring us through it ought to bring us
[48:16] closer to God come on it ought to make
[48:19] you love God just the more but most of
[48:22] the time it doesn't people think go
[48:24] things go in and out but don't you know
[48:26] the tri tribulation thing God's bringing
[48:29] you through is to bring him bring you
[48:31] closer to him Hallelujah to let you
[48:34] because he's letting you know all the
[48:35] time that I love you I care about you I
[48:38] want to see about your every hurt and
[48:41] your every pain all well-being it's like
[48:44] like he says here the god of Grace all
[48:47] Grace come on but what it is our minds
[48:50] sometimes is focused on us and our what
[48:53] we going to do in life and what we got
[48:55] to achieve and what all our goals and
[48:57] all our wants and all those things but
[49:00] like the Bible says humble yourselves
[49:02] before the mighty hand of God come on
[49:05] and then he'll exalt you in due season
[49:08] come on God God will exalt you God will
[49:11] take you wherever you got to go at in
[49:13] this life or whatever you got to be
[49:15] blessed with whatever God see fit God
[49:17] will get you wherever you got to go and
[49:19] you know one thing about it the devil
[49:21] will try to stop it but the devil can't
[49:23] stop it because he's the Mighty God come
[49:26] on he said humble yourselves before the
[49:28] what before the mighty hand of God come
[49:31] on the God if I can say this tonight I
[49:34] don't know how to say it but God loves
[49:36] you God loves you he the Bible says he
[49:39] cares for you come on he cares for you
[49:42] and your wellbeing God does God cares
[49:46] about you people can talk about yourself
[49:48] do you think God don't care God cares
[49:51] about you you're his little one you're
[49:53] his child God cares about you you know
[49:55] and that humbles your so much you know
[49:57] you think about I says one thing about
[49:59] the grace of God you know I says that
[50:03] God's God's grace God God he gives us
[50:07] stuff that we don't
[50:08] deserve come on many of times you think
[50:12] you deserve things God you don't deserve
[50:14] many of times God gives you things you
[50:16] don't deserve because he loves you amen
[50:19] come on when man fell I thought I was
[50:22] thinking about that when man fell in the
[50:24] Garden of Eden God longed to have fellow
[50:26] ship with man man did wrong but even
[50:29] when they fell by the grace of God he
[50:32] had a Plan of Redemption to get them
[50:34] back in fellowship and that PL that that
[50:37] Plan of Redemption to get them back in
[50:39] Fellowship was going to be something had
[50:41] to die Hallelujah innocent subject but
[50:44] he desired even himself through shedding
[50:46] of his own blood to come down that you
[50:48] and I don't you know that the devil he
[50:51] he he's the one accusing you and I a day
[50:54] and night because God want God to
[50:56] destroy Dy you but one thing about it
[50:58] you were in the mind of God come on you
[51:00] were a part of God before the world
[51:02] began God had a and even though when you
[51:05] were there though you might have been
[51:06] born the way you were born though you
[51:08] might have been the way that you were
[51:10] that God had a plan by his grace to get
[51:13] you back to where he was where he saw
[51:15] you at Hallelujah to get you back to
[51:18] that place so when we see these things
[51:20] you know I begin to just start thanking
[51:22] God because I said God it ain't in me
[51:25] and what I can do but God I just help me
[51:27] Lord just to yield to what you're
[51:29] calling me to yield to what you're
[51:32] bringing me to Lord because I can't you
[51:34] can't get there on your own but it's got
[51:36] to be God bring you into that but your
[51:40] job your and our job is to do what to
[51:42] praise God through all the circumstances
[51:45] praise God through the ups and the Downs
[51:47] through the sun through the rain no
[51:49] matter what comes our way our job is to
[51:51] give God thanks no matter what come on I
[51:55] start looking at things said God I
[51:57] didn't bring myself here you called me
[51:59] you brought me this far and I'm trusting
[52:01] on you to keep on taking me the rest of
[52:03] the way Hallelujah God I don't have the
[52:06] strength sometimes sometimes I don't
[52:07] even feel like I have the will but
[52:09] something keep drawing me keep calling
[52:12] me and what it is I believe the seed
[52:14] that God planted there Hallelujah I you
[52:17] don't even see yourself sometimes as
[52:19] what God said you were but it don't
[52:20] matter how you see yourself it's what
[52:23] God called you Hallelujah he said I know
[52:26] my thoughts concerning you and there
[52:28] thoughts of good and not evil the devil
[52:30] put all kind of things in your mind but
[52:32] God know his thoughts concerning you I
[52:34] ain't looking at how you how you look
[52:37] right now but God know his thoughts
[52:38] concerning you Hallelujah and when he
[52:41] start pulling on you it's something
[52:43] about when he start pulling on you all
[52:45] the Devils from hell can try to hold you
[52:47] back but when God start pulling on you
[52:50] God start calling you you it's it's it's
[52:54] irresistible Hallelujah I believe that
[52:57] tonight come on but it's the grace of
[52:59] God sometimes like I said we take God's
[53:01] grace for granted don't we come on we
[53:04] look at you know I was thinking and I
[53:06] said I want to be long tonight but I
[53:09] says the grace of God he says humble
[53:12] yourselves uh uh before the mighty hand
[53:15] of God come on humble yourselves under
[53:17] the mighty hand of God God is mighty
[53:20] come on he's the almighty God Amen you
[53:23] know God can when God want to put a stop
[53:26] to something he can put a stop to
[53:28] something anytime he wants come on
[53:32] because why he's the Mighty
[53:34] God sometimes we play with God like he's
[53:37] a
[53:38] man or we take him like he's a man but
[53:41] God isn't a man he's not a man like the
[53:44] bible say that he shall lie but he's the
[53:45] Mighty God and the word asks us to
[53:48] Humble
[53:50] ourselves under his mighty hand come
[53:52] on but the thing about it is it ain't
[53:55] that God wants to be your Taskmaster
[53:58] like that but he cares for you come on
[54:02] the devil is your enemy he's the one
[54:04] trying to destroy you amen the devil
[54:06] want to destroy your life sometimes we
[54:08] don't know or realize we playing around
[54:10] but the devil ain't playing with you the
[54:12] devil want to destroy your life there a
[54:15] wrar line you going to tear you to
[54:16] pieces he'll have you out there strung
[54:18] out on drugs all kinds of thing the
[54:20] devil the devil don't care nothing about
[54:22] you when he get in there tear everything
[54:25] up amen come on but God is saying you
[54:27] need to stay up under my mighty hand for
[54:29] your protection come on because we don't
[54:32] know every every hour every minute out
[54:34] the day maybe the devil is planning to
[54:36] destroy your life but the grace of God
[54:39] is there God got a hedge about you that
[54:42] when the devil trying to destroy you God
[54:44] is keeping you God Is Watching Over You

[55:05] as individuals got to be ready at all
[55:08] times it the thing thing is you know I I
[55:11] just kind of just go ahead on you know I
[55:14] was at work the other day and and uh it
[55:17] could have been all over with just like
[55:20] that right all over with you know we
[55:23] were having some rough times at work
[55:26] with with uh this one machine and and we
[55:28] were trying to use Steam from the baller
[55:31] to clear these lines out like we
[55:33] normally do but you know it was right
[55:38] not even an hour before that we all made
[55:41] the statement man the day can't get no
[55:44] worse but the day can always get
[55:48] worse you
[55:50] know sitting there and trying to steam
[55:53] these lines out and and I was sitting
[55:55] there on this in us I thought for sure I
[55:57] seen wax
[55:59] flowing I began to say oh we good man we
[56:03] good we got wax flowing but when I was
[56:06] closing the Val I thought I was closing
[56:08] it but it wasn't closing it was
[56:10] opening and what we made was a
[56:14] bomb and the thing went off so bad I
[56:17] mean just like that and you ain't had
[56:20] time to react it just blowed up when it
[56:24] did
[56:26] I know it knocked me off my
[56:28] feet I mean I flew back and hit the hit
[56:32] the ground I hit my head before I hit
[56:33] the ground but when I hit the ground all
[56:37] I seen was like the cloud it was like a
[56:40] cloudy cloudy and I seen rain like rain
[56:44] but it was hot wax and all of it was
[56:47] dumping all on me so I'm thinking when
[56:51] I'm laying there on the floor it I just
[56:54] unbelievable I thought the myself this

[59:23] that time I felt as though that Lord if
[59:26] you calling me Lord I'm ready for you

[1:06:00] order because God you know I thought
[1:06:04] about um earthquake is was
[1:06:09] 4.7 happened in Malibu right there by
[1:06:12] Los Angeles the other day I said y'all
[1:06:16] it it ain't going to be
[1:06:18] long to somebody going to say Los
[1:06:21] Angeles is
[1:06:23] gone and millions time
[1:06:26] millions are gone
[1:06:29] under what kind of Effect one of these
[1:06:32] days is going to be
[1:06:35] said and I want to I want to know will
[1:06:38] we have time then to get
[1:06:41] ready I believe that that'll be too
[1:06:44] late because you're going to run and
[1:06:46] you're going to say I want all
[1:06:49] then I I want give us of you all and
[1:06:52] it's too late you had your opportunity
[1:06:55] to get right with God you had your
[1:06:58] opportunity to get the baptism of the
[1:07:00] Holy Ghost but you didn't want
[1:07:03] it but I said to
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:07] you it won't be
[1:07:12] long as I said before the prophet said
[1:07:16] seven things he saw in
[1:07:19] 1933 one was a woman being the president
[1:07:22] a vice president
[1:07:25] and we already had the vice president
[1:07:27] but it looks like it's coming to the
[1:07:31] president seven thing was saw America
[1:07:34] being blowed
[1:07:38] up but I
[1:07:41] wonder when the people would take it
[1:07:44] serious you know he said as it was in
[1:07:47] the days of lot and as it was in the
[1:07:50] days of Sodom and and as in the days of
[1:07:53] Noah so shall it be
[1:07:56] when did the people wake up I believe
[1:07:58] they wake they woke up when the rain
[1:08:01] start
[1:08:03] falling I said when the Great
[1:08:05] Tribulation start setting in I believe
[1:08:08] that's when people say well
[1:08:10] I I want you God lord I need the Holy
[1:08:14] Ghost I want it I believe that that's
[1:08:17] the rain start falling somebody said
[1:08:21] they knocked on the one and they knocked
[1:08:23] on the door I don't believe they could
[1:08:24] reach it
[1:08:26] I believe God had his angels
[1:08:29] there praise God and I believe that they
[1:08:33] couldn't get in
[1:08:35] then one day he's going to rise up and
[1:08:37] he's going to shut through the door the
[1:08:40] door would be shut the door for the
[1:08:42] Gentiles would be
[1:08:45] shut there'll be no more
[1:08:48] time you can't come in then
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:55] the Great Tribulation to be
[1:08:59] on take your
[1:09:01] time but hurry
[1:09:04] up hurry up do something about your
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:10] condition we've been experiencing
[1:09:13] Revival and certain presence of God and
[1:09:16] anointing and there have been spirits
[1:09:20] that have anointed people to try to hold
[1:09:22] back the anointing of God
[1:09:26] but I believe as we just get
[1:09:28] Earnest and keep
[1:09:30] praying that we overpower these demons
[1:09:33] that try to hold
[1:09:35] back the that are afraid to enter
[1:09:39] in he said the rain falls on the just
[1:09:42] and unjust I believe the power of God it
[1:09:45] get so
[1:09:46] great that the they couldn't help
[1:09:53] themselves repentance should come
[1:09:56] we've been experiencing a supernatural
