[29:01] jesus christ's name
[29:04] hebrews 1
[29:06] and 1.

[29:14] god
[29:16] who at saundry times in indirect manners
[29:20] spaking time passed
[29:23] unto the fathers by the prophets
[29:26] half in these last days
[29:30] spoken unto us by his son
[29:34] whom he had appointed heir of all things
[29:38] by whom also he made the worlds
[29:42] who being
[29:43] the brightness of his glory
[29:47] in the express image of his person
[29:50] and upholding all things by the word of
[29:54] his power
[29:56] when he had by himself purged our sins
[29:59] sat down or right hand of the majesty on
[30:03] high
[30:04] let us pray
[30:07] father god we
[30:09] want to thank you tonight for your word
[30:11] god

[30:19] lord let it live let it find a resting
[30:22] place
[30:24] god i pray that you bless it now in
[30:26] jesus name
[30:28] amen and amen maybe seated
[30:37] i want to use for
[30:40] a little thought just for a few minutes
[30:42] tonight
[30:45] on god is identified by his
[30:48] characteristics
[30:51] are the characteristics of god
[30:58] we
[31:00] understand that
[31:04] basically
[31:05] everything can be identified by
[31:09] its characteristics
[31:13] you know i was thinking about adam when
[31:16] he named everything
[31:19] there must there was something that adam
[31:22] saw
[31:24] in the animal life pertaining said let's
[31:26] just take the animal life that he began
[31:29] to name the different animals they there
[31:31] was something about
[31:33] the characteristic of the animals that
[31:36] that adam just drew his conclusion to do
[31:40] special when it comes to a dog
[31:45] being that he was the very express image
[31:48] of god
[31:52] before the fall
[31:54] adam had dominion
[31:57] he had authority he had power
[32:01] because he was the very expressed image
[32:05] of god
[32:09] and i was
[32:11] just looking
[32:14] and thinking about each and every one of
[32:17] us
[32:18] here tonight
[32:20] within us
[32:22] from our natural family line there are a
[32:26] certain characteristics
[32:30] that identified us
[32:33] with the palmers are whatever your name
[32:36] that may be you are identified by the
[32:39] characteristics of the family trait
[32:45] sometimes though characteristics are not
[32:48] good but yet
[32:49] you got to be identified with it because
[32:52] it's in your bloodline
[32:59] and
[33:00] thinking about jesus christ
[33:04] he was the very express image
[33:08] of god characteristics
[33:11] on earth
[33:14] his life that he lived
[33:18] uh he never lived it
[33:21] for himself but he always was saying
[33:24] that i only do what the father showed me
[33:31] he lived a life to express
[33:34] god
[33:36] to that particular generation in which
[33:39] he lived
[33:42] yet they missed him
[33:45] they couldn't recognize that he was god
[33:50] on
[33:51] earth in flesh
[33:53] to reconcile the world
[33:56] back to god again
[34:00] and his entire life
[34:03] was a life of complete
[34:06] sacrifice
[34:09] not for himself but he lived it for
[34:13] others
[34:16] what he was doing portraying that
[34:19] god's image
[34:22] that the life that god wanted to lay
[34:25] down was for the human race
[34:31] to reconcile the people
[34:34] back to god again
[34:38] and looking at the old testament saints
[34:41] and
[34:42] the prophets of all and the types and
[34:46] the shadows that their very life was
[34:50] expressing
[34:51] the characteristics of god
[34:54] especially joseph and moses and the
[34:58] prophets
[34:59] the things that they did how they uh uh
[35:03] just gave their life
[35:06] for israel
[35:08] even though god wanted to destroy them
[35:11] they threw their life in between god and
[35:14] the people
[35:16] to what were they doing portraying the
[35:20] characteristics
[35:21] of god
[35:25] and i'm took this message from
[35:28] god as identified by a characteristic
[35:30] there are some things that i really want
[35:32] to
[35:33] try by god's grace to just bring
[35:37] out tonight
[35:39] to show you and i that
[35:43] you can do no more than what's in you to
[35:46] do
[35:48] but notice as our natural birth
[35:53] brought us characteristics of palmers
[35:56] and
[35:57] one guy that i was cutting on my brother
[35:59] grass and
[36:00] he always said you know he said man if i
[36:04] had blindfold he said you know i was
[36:07] really mistaking you for being larry
[36:10] because y'all talk alike
[36:14] why because it's the characteristics
[36:17] it's something from birth from the
[36:20] natural and i didn't have to try to
[36:23] make myself do that and you don't have
[36:25] to make yourself be whoever you are it's
[36:29] already in you
[36:32] by nature
[36:35] and you know i find this screen because
[36:38] a lot of times without doing a little
[36:40] series but i find we struggle
[36:43] uh
[36:44] sometimes our people struggle
[36:47] sometimes to
[36:49] actually produce a christian
[36:52] life and the only way that could be done
[36:56] there got to be
[36:58] a supernatural experience that takes
[37:02] place on the inside of you
[37:06] because i'm i'm seeing more now that you
[37:09] can learn about god and you can learn
[37:12] how you ought to live and how you ought
[37:16] to talk
[37:17] but uh if it's not coming from
[37:21] the inside you only are acting
[37:27] something that you know
[37:29] you ought to be like it but it hasn't
[37:32] fully been
[37:33] or developed yet because of a nature
[37:37] change
[37:40] and i i'm learning more and more that
[37:43] god uh
[37:45] his full requirements
[37:48] is for us is to be in his image
[37:53] not palmer's image
[37:55] because that image won't get you very
[37:58] far
[38:00] some images we have of people and you
[38:02] know how people are
[38:04] they they want to be identified with
[38:07] certain people
[38:10] because of their
[38:11] characteristics or maybe of a certain uh
[38:15] brand name of clothing that they wear
[38:18] because that you you look like you got
[38:21] something
[38:23] and most of the time you don't
[38:27] you just have a piece of clothing
[38:30] that you bought that somebody else made
[38:34] and
[38:34] it makes you identify that hey
[38:38] look at me
[38:41] and it don't get you nowhere
[38:44] you feel good about it but then when
[38:47] that is over you got to find another
[38:50] image
[38:52] and we go through images to to be
[38:55] identified with which sometimes uh how
[38:58] we look or how we dress or or what we
[39:01] drive or where we live
[39:04] and the god he said
[39:06] that doesn't move me one bit
[39:10] what i'm looking for is for a change
[39:15] that is not natural but
[39:18] it's a supernatural change
[39:21] and it's only even in our good
[39:26] in our best effort
[39:29] that we try uh
[39:32] you know to be
[39:34] more like god
[39:37] because of humanistic efforts
[39:41] we find ourselves
[39:43] struggling and coming short
[39:47] but i'm learning that it's not how we
[39:50] struggle but it's how much you can yield
[39:55] see it's uh it's letting
[39:58] uh uh god
[40:00] have preeminence
[40:05] you know and in this age we find out
[40:08] that
[40:09] people can really put on some acts
[40:14] but the servant of god say normally
[40:17] when pressure comes off a trial come it
[40:21] brings out the real you
[40:26] you can pretend to be something but
[40:30] something about pressure
[40:33] something about suffering and trial
[40:37] it really
[40:38] brings out
[40:41] even the characteristics of god
[40:43] or the characteristic of your natural
[40:46] birth
[40:48] that's why i i see
[40:51] more and more that you've got to be born
[40:54] again
[40:56] cause without that you'll be trying and
[41:00] i talked to people they said i'm trying
[41:02] brother jeremiah i'm trying so hard but
[41:05] every time i try
[41:08] i keep failing and i say sister brother
[41:11] you have to fail
[41:14] because it's not in you trying
[41:17] because god already done it
[41:20] you
[41:22] accept it by faith and then let god take
[41:26] over
[41:28] i believe yes there has to be a
[41:33] you willingness
[41:34] that uh god wants preeminence
[41:39] and you give him the preeminence lord
[41:41] that whatever god that's not in me
[41:44] that's not right lord move it
[41:48] because i want to be like you
[41:52] and the only way you can be like god is
[41:55] to have the nature of god and already
[41:59] have the nature of god is to be born
[42:02] again
[42:05] then if we are really born again
[42:10] by the spirit of god see
[42:13] because we're understanding now that you
[42:16] know i'm really rejoicing because
[42:20] i'm looking at god's characteristics
[42:24] and how god is trying to mold us
[42:27] and to shape us
[42:29] not what we want to be but what he wants
[42:33] us to be
[42:35] and the quicker we realize that that
[42:38] life you have don't belong to you
[42:43] it belongs to him
[42:46] and god wants to come in and abide in
[42:50] you
[42:51] and we've got to
[42:53] let god do
[42:55] all the work
[42:59] sometimes we just want him
[43:01] just to be a savior
[43:04] but we don't want him to be the ruler
[43:09] that he won't
[43:11] control
[43:13] of your entire life
[43:16] that's why the bible said seek ye
[43:19] first
[43:22] the kingdom of god and all his
[43:24] righteousness and all these other things
[43:27] will be added to you
[43:31] and the more we realize that
[43:34] uh god knows what's best for us
[43:40] i learned that we can try it
[43:43] our way and we'll found out
[43:45] you just make a mess out of it
[43:50] all because god ways are higher than our
[43:52] ways his thoughts are higher
[43:56] see what god did for us that we're not
[43:59] recognizing that even before
[44:03] you were even born god already knew you
[44:08] and there are certain things that that
[44:10] god put in us
[44:13] you know before the foundation in the
[44:15] world
[44:16] god planted a seed
[44:19] and that seed if it's the right seed or
[44:23] if the wrong seed it got to bring forth
[44:27] of the kind it is
[44:30] i've been looking for go up me to become
[44:32] genesis
[44:35] i've been looking for this the other
[44:37] night and couldn't find it
[44:39] not couldn't find it really i just been
[44:41] looking over it
[44:49] genesis 1
[44:53] you know
[44:55] i i hear i i used to hear and still
[44:58] hearing that how that
[45:00] we ought to be resting in god
[45:04] why rest because in him is complete
[45:11] see
[45:12] we sometimes and as you know to
[45:15] understand uh that's
[45:17] nature of man human people we're always
[45:21] trying to find out
[45:23] uh what to do with our life
[45:27] and we'll do this and do that and do
[45:29] everything else except ask god
[45:34] we try to be a muslim we are trying to
[45:36] be this we try to be a atheist we are
[45:38] trying to be a hip-hop we try to be cool
[45:41] we try to be slain we thought all these
[45:44] avenues and yet it's laying right there
[45:47] that god created us for his own glory
[45:53] and when god created he wanted you and i
[45:56] to understand that i made you a son and
[45:59] a daughter of god
[46:03] stop struggling to be like oprah
[46:07] or these superstars be like mike
[46:11] be like lebron be like tyson be like all
[46:15] of these fallen stars
[46:19] why not be like jesus
[46:23] and be like everybody else sometimes we
[46:26] want to be like the palmers or be like
[46:29] somebody else who we think is great
[46:33] and there's nobody great amongst us
[46:37] no nobody
[46:40] you know and i have to confess it
[46:42] because that i remember years back in 89
[46:47] you know that how when i first you know
[46:50] were coming to mullins and
[46:52] uh they were having meetings all over
[46:54] and i'm new you know like a new kid on
[46:56] the block
[46:57] and and i'm going about you know seeing
[47:00] the meetings and the people preaching
[47:02] and and man and these guys were so
[47:06] swell you know speaking and everybody
[47:10] was running and jumping and hauling
[47:13] and and myself i still i wonder
[47:16] sometimes
[47:17] do they really know what they're
[47:18] hollering about
[47:20] you know i always will one you know my
[47:23] wife get up she said that my son's real
[47:25] like me that we just quiet people in
[47:28] this city and look
[47:30] you know because i believe in deserving
[47:32] things
[47:34] and i kind of sometimes won't know
[47:36] whether or not it's real or do we
[47:39] understand what we are excited about
[47:42] now i believe we ought to be excited but
[47:45] at least know what you excited about
[47:49] you know somebody say you know uh don't
[47:51] jump no higher than you live
[47:54] you know but when you get something in
[47:58] you and you know
[47:59] that uh he's there and then you got a
[48:03] right you know to
[48:04] to jump
[48:06] you're not just jumping because
[48:08] sometimes people move because other
[48:09] people move
[48:11] one shout and know somewhere i'm gonna
[48:13] shout
[48:14] but no it's because that yes we got
[48:17] something to be shouting about everyone
[48:21] because god has truly did a marvelous
[48:24] work in this hour
[48:27] and the servant of god said that we
[48:29] ought to be the most happiest people on
[48:33] earth why because we understand now by
[48:37] the opening of the word that the
[48:39] fullness of god has been made known to
[48:43] us
[48:44] all that god ever wants to do and
[48:48] written in his word he made it known in
[48:50] this generation
[48:52] no other generation had that
[48:56] they had it in parts
[48:59] they had you know a little here and a
[49:01] little dead because god always makes his
[49:04] word known to the people of that
[49:07] particular age
[49:09] but in this age here he had uh made all
[49:14] that he ever uh awarded or to express
[49:19] you to us his hour he opened the book
[49:24] and he expressed himself that
[49:28] i created you to be in my image
[49:33] oh
[49:34] lord have mercy
[49:37] when when we understand that you are not
[49:40] just a painter or electrician or never
[49:44] know a nurse you are a son and a
[49:46] daughter of almighty god
[49:49] oh my
[49:50] what an honor and a privilege to be able
[49:54] to have the very characteristics
[49:57] of god
[49:59] tabernacling in your mortal body
[50:04] that's what the devil don't want us to
[50:06] understand
[50:07] we're not just playing churches we that
[50:10] is going through a message but we
[50:12] expressing the very characteristics of
[50:16] god in this thing
[50:19] see this day this scripture is being
[50:23] fulfilled right in our ears
[50:26] your very life
[50:29] oh my
[50:31] disciples one time
[50:33] uh begin
[50:35] uh somebody asked them and they said sir
[50:38] we would see jesus
[50:42] and i believe there's still a desire
[50:44] most people didn't really want to see
[50:45] god
[50:48] and god always veiled himself
[50:52] in earthly vessels
[50:55] but the characteristics
[50:59] the several gods of god are not natural
[51:03] but they are supernatural
[51:06] i believe every child of god that's born
[51:09] of his spirit
[51:11] they got to have the supernatural
[51:16] why because it's in them
[51:19] the character very characteristics of
[51:22] god is is pushing out and saying that
[51:26] give me more
[51:29] i'm expecting more you know my
[51:31] daughter's on that i'm expecting great
[51:34] things that's how we ought to be
[51:37] but why because the characteristics of
[51:40] god it begins to make you push out
[51:45] because there's something in you that
[51:48] that wants to be expressed
[51:51] what is it god in you
[51:54] expressing the very supernatural
[51:57] manifestation
[51:59] of god for your particular
[52:02] hour oh lord
[52:06] you know what
[52:07] i've been saying lately i think you know
[52:11] we use you know
[52:12] uh hear people say it a lot but it's
[52:15] true
[52:17] and you notice this the little slogan
[52:20] that we use but now slowly it is
[52:21] actually said all that was in god he
[52:24] poured it into christ
[52:26] and then all that was in christ he
[52:28] poured it into church
[52:30] i'll be like my family i say but i'll
[52:33] say that do we have those things
[52:37] and if we do
[52:39] why are we not expressing it
[52:43] it's because a lot of times lack of
[52:45] understanding who we are
[52:51] when you recognize who you really are
[52:55] what this world is doing and what's
[52:57] going in it don't even phase you
[53:01] because within you is deity
[53:05] it's god you know life that's that's in
[53:08] you that that that you are no longer
[53:11] just earthbound people but you're in
[53:15] heavenly places
[53:18] you're in another dimension
[53:20] though we see you here but you are
[53:23] somewhere else
[53:26] you know you are living in heavenly
[53:28] atmosphere
[53:30] you are living in an age that where all
[53:34] things are possible
[53:37] everybody else sitting looking say well
[53:40] when is a disc going to happen when is
[53:42] that going to happen it's happening
[53:47] people always missed it
[53:50] the great move of god
[53:52] what the church ought to be in power
[53:56] the characteristics
[53:58] you know and uh the spoken word let me
[54:02] read you this one i really want to get
[54:04] that out
[54:09] 1 11.
[54:12] and god said
[54:14] let the earth bring forth grass
[54:17] the herb yielding seed
[54:22] and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[54:25] after his kind
[54:27] notice this whose seed is in itself
[54:33] upon the earth and it was so
[54:36] and the earth brought forth forth grass
[54:39] and
[54:40] herb eating seed after his kind
[54:43] and the tree-eating fruit
[54:45] excuse me whose seed was in itself
[54:49] after his kind and god saw that it was
[54:54] good see
[54:56] so every seed in the word is a seed
[55:01] if that word be planted correctly in our
[55:06] lives it'll bring forth fruit
[55:09] your life ought to be a fruit tree
[55:14] because the seed of god the word you
[55:18] know abideth in you
[55:21] you know i i remember brother earnest
[55:23] preaching the song of the sermon about
[55:25] speaking
[55:28] why
[55:29] because that's what god used the spoken
[55:32] word
[55:34] and if that seed of god abide in us
[55:39] then there is a a season that god begin
[55:43] to move us into that kind of anointing
[55:53] go up me to the book of psalms
[55:56] 1.
[56:05] i'm thinking about
[56:07] i mean paul and peter those
[56:11] and how
[56:12] they
[56:15] we're talking about
[56:18] how god made
[56:21] uh the unsearchable riches
[56:24] you know
[56:25] the unsearchable riches of christ
[56:29] you know what now i'm i'm understanding
[56:31] now that there is a season that god does
[56:35] certain things
[56:38] it's like there's a season you plant
[56:40] certain things in the ground to grow
[56:43] and if you plant it out of season it'll
[56:46] die
[56:48] so at a certain season
[56:51] a good farmer knows when to plant
[56:54] collard greens
[56:57] he knows you know what it's going to
[56:59] take
[57:01] to get the very
[57:02] fruits of his labor
[57:05] and i believe god knows also
[57:09] see when god planted these seeds god is
[57:12] looking for
[57:13] fruits
[57:16] no man ever plant a garlic and don't
[57:18] look for any kind of harvest
[57:22] and i believe we're in the harvest time
[57:27] that every seed had ever been planted
[57:30] it got to come to maturity
[57:34] no matter what seed it is it got to come
[57:38] up to where are to be recognized
[57:46] psalm 1
[57:50] 1-3
[57:52] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[57:55] the counsel of the ungodly
[57:57] nor standeth in the way of the sinners
[58:01] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[58:04] but his delight is in the law of the
[58:06] lord
[58:07] and in his law does he meditate day and
[58:10] night
[58:12] and he shall be like a tree
[58:15] planted by the rivers of water
[58:18] that bringeth forth his fruit
[58:21] in his season see
[58:25] his leaf also should not wither
[58:27] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[58:32] in other words there is a sea it was a
[58:34] season
[58:36] that every word that was spoken by god
[58:40] it had to come to pass
[58:43] from the beginning of time god had
[58:46] seasoned that he dealt with adam and eve
[58:49] he dealt with abraham he dealt with
[58:51] moses he gave them a particular word for
[58:56] the season and for the generation that
[58:59] they were living
[59:01] and that word spoken by a prophet as
[59:03] hebrews said you know and they spoke the
[59:06] word of god for that particular hour the
[59:09] age that liveth
[59:11] could have rejoiced in that word for
[59:13] that hour
[59:14] because that was the very express image
[59:18] of god
[59:20] what he was expecting of them see
[59:24] and in every age you know you think
[59:26] about the um the church ages you know
[59:29] how god allowed it you know so much of
[59:32] his word to be made known through the
[59:34] seven church ages
[59:36] you know pieces of it the pieces of it
[59:39] you know but even every age starting
[59:42] from ephesus to laodicea if you knew uh
[59:46] understand the definition of of each aid
[59:49] there was a certain characteristics
[59:52] it was identifying that a certain spirit
[59:55] that was working in the ephesus age all
[59:58] down the layer laodicea and the people
[1:00:01] that live they had to deal with that
[1:00:04] particular spirit because it was
[1:00:07] affecting them
[1:00:09] and in this age of laodicea we have an
[1:00:13] age of people's rights
[1:00:16] or people's justice
[1:00:19] which is identifying
[1:00:21] the characteristics
[1:00:23] how the people are going to be conformed
[1:00:26] to but to the bride to those that
[1:00:30] understand that we don't belong to those
[1:00:33] things
[1:00:35] we were called out of that
[1:00:38] and we have called we've been called to
[1:00:41] a higher calling
[1:00:43] in this eight here god is looking for
[1:00:47] perfection
[1:00:49] he said being ye perfect as your
[1:00:52] fatherly father is perfect
[1:00:55] so god is calling for a higher calling
[1:00:59] than luther and wesley and all of those
[1:01:02] other ages
[1:01:03] it's the age of the full
[1:01:06] a manifestation
[1:01:08] of god characteristics in this hour
[1:01:13] if you don't mind me
[1:01:16] reading a little something
[1:01:21] god here
[1:01:23] seven was bringing out
[1:01:26] he was talking about matthew 24 how
[1:01:30] those
[1:01:30] uh two spirits were going to be so close
[1:01:35] that if it was possible
[1:01:37] it'll deceive their very lack
[1:01:41] but he said what
[1:01:43] identifies the two is the
[1:01:45] characteristics
[1:01:48] because god
[1:01:50] always identify himself through
[1:01:53] supernatural uh events
[1:01:58] even though that even in this hour you
[1:02:00] know we have twins
[1:02:02] it always has been like that
[1:02:05] you know uh start up with cain and abel
[1:02:08] you know esau and jacob you know it
[1:02:10] always was those
[1:02:12] so close uh look just like you know the
[1:02:16] real but yet
[1:02:18] folks
[1:02:20] but he said it's the characteristic that
[1:02:23] identifies it
[1:02:26] and here he was talking about uh israel
[1:02:29] and mohammed
[1:02:32] he said look as israel was in his
[1:02:35] journey
[1:02:36] coming up out of egypt
[1:02:38] now god was with israel
[1:02:41] he shown them a great sign down there
[1:02:45] sent a prophet to him and identified his
[1:02:48] written word
[1:02:50] and as he brought them up we watch
[1:02:54] his characteristics
[1:02:56] how he met moses
[1:03:00] and the things which he did
[1:03:03] and on the road there was up another
[1:03:05] nation which was moab now mohave was a
[1:03:08] great nation also
[1:03:10] not a heathen by no means
[1:03:13] he said that was a lot daughter's
[1:03:15] children
[1:03:17] and they were believers
[1:03:19] now watch the two nations one of them is
[1:03:22] recognized as a recognized nation the
[1:03:26] other one is just a sojourner
[1:03:29] now they come to the place that uh this
[1:03:32] great nation mohamed lays right straight
[1:03:36] in the line of their path of duty to go
[1:03:39] to the promised land
[1:03:41] you know remind me so much of judas that
[1:03:44] he went so far with them you know
[1:03:46] casting out the devils preaching and all
[1:03:48] of that
[1:03:49] but it came a time that judas never made
[1:03:52] it to pentecost
[1:03:55] why because his true colors showed
[1:03:59] and you know i believe it's going to be
[1:04:01] exactly the same you know though we have
[1:04:04] this two groups that look like twins and
[1:04:08] remind me of uh matthew 25 about the uh
[1:04:11] the 10 virgins
[1:04:13] both of them clean
[1:04:15] living people
[1:04:18] they were on a journey five took
[1:04:22] lamps with their oil and five took a
[1:04:24] lamp with no oil
[1:04:27] see
[1:04:28] what was it the characteristics
[1:04:32] the five wives knew that their journey
[1:04:35] may be long so they took extra oil
[1:04:39] i believe that's what it is today we
[1:04:42] ought to understand it's going to take
[1:04:44] extra holy ghost in this hour
[1:04:48] it's going to take more than just
[1:04:50] quoting what brother branham said it's
[1:04:52] going to take more than us just
[1:04:54] repeating what he said it's going to
[1:04:57] take the very power of the holy ghost
[1:05:01] with a double potion
[1:05:04] extra oil
[1:05:06] i'll be the bible say that his bride
[1:05:09] she made herself ready or she didn't
[1:05:13] wait till the preacher call it she
[1:05:17] understand that i got to have more than
[1:05:20] this
[1:05:21] i got to have more than just good sermon
[1:05:24] i need a revelation of god for myself
[1:05:28] and uh as the uh our foolish version
[1:05:32] uh realized at the end when the
[1:05:34] bridegoon came they rose up and found
[1:05:37] out
[1:05:38] their oil was gone
[1:05:41] and then they began to tell why give us
[1:05:44] of your oil they said no not so
[1:05:47] go pray up and get your own
[1:05:50] church it's an hour now
[1:05:53] you need to get prayed up
[1:05:56] i i can't never get away from it you
[1:05:58] know brother caleb said you know we
[1:06:01] don't know what's going to happen next
[1:06:05] but i believe we are about to say be
[1:06:08] ye
[1:06:09] ready
[1:06:11] how do you get ready
[1:06:13] seek him
[1:06:15] now
[1:06:16] don't wait to the next epidemic
[1:06:20] take advantage of that lord prepare me
[1:06:24] for whatever may come god i don't know
[1:06:28] what it might be lord but you got to
[1:06:30] keep me
[1:06:32] because if god don't keep us
[1:06:35] we are lost
[1:06:38] but it's going to take something
[1:06:41] within us that is crying out lord i
[1:06:44] can't just wait till i go to church lord
[1:06:47] but i need it now
[1:06:52] oh what an hour
[1:06:55] what an hour i believe that if we don't
[1:06:59] uh get refocused
[1:07:03] let's not just come to church like time
[1:07:06] pass
[1:07:08] but let's come to church with a purpose
[1:07:12] lord you gave us another chance
[1:07:17] now we know that it's coming that our
[1:07:19] doors are going to be closed shortly
[1:07:22] and they're not going to be reopened
[1:07:26] so i believe the bible say that as we
[1:07:29] see that they're approaching us we ought
[1:07:32] to assemble ourself the more
[1:07:37] you know it used to be a time that we
[1:07:40] didn't mind coming to church twice on
[1:07:42] sundays or whatever
[1:07:45] now it almost kill us
[1:07:49] we just don't have that
[1:07:51] drive like that
[1:07:53] and i was saying lord we need restoring
[1:07:58] we need something god a fresh
[1:08:02] outpouring of your spirit that will
[1:08:05] illuminate us
[1:08:09] but as elijah said we're not going to
[1:08:12] get it until
[1:08:13] we call for it
[1:08:16] we always want the pastor to call it why
[1:08:21] if your salvation built on him our
[1:08:24] brother earnest the brother jeremiah no
[1:08:27] so why wait
[1:08:29] you call for it
[1:08:31] you know what you need
[1:08:33] you know and nobody can do it but god
[1:08:37] so why
[1:08:38] wait
[1:08:40] they always say wait always break the
[1:08:42] wagon down
[1:08:45] wait till the next meeting we wait to
[1:08:47] the next gathering we wait to the next
[1:08:50] good preacher we just wait
[1:08:53] and i learned that even from experience
[1:08:55] i had
[1:08:57] you know but god had to rebuke me on it
[1:08:59] until
[1:09:00] getting to tell me you know why you wait
[1:09:02] to do something that i told you because
[1:09:06] i was trying to get more people involved
[1:09:08] you know how we all we feel like it
[1:09:10] ought to be a collective thing but if
[1:09:12] god revealed it to you
[1:09:15] and put it on your heart then you don't
[1:09:17] wait for nobody else you know you talk
[1:09:20] to the pastor and let them know what's
[1:09:22] on your heart you know what not and then
[1:09:24] you know you begin to proceed
[1:09:27] not just doing anything but
[1:09:30] we want to uh
[1:09:32] know what we're doing we want to have
[1:09:33] the right inspiration that god
[1:09:37] you put it on and if god put it on your
[1:09:39] heart then god will manifest it
[1:09:44] here want us to read a little bit more
[1:09:45] about this moab
[1:09:49] these
[1:09:50] two nations
[1:09:52] each each of them
[1:09:54] had a prophet
[1:09:56] moses and balaam
[1:09:58] both of them were prophets
[1:10:00] both of them
[1:10:01] had
[1:10:02] fundamental
[1:10:04] uh they built all tools they did exactly
[1:10:07] god's requirement you know building the
[1:10:09] seven ought i'm gonna skip down
[1:10:12] same altar same god
[1:10:15] but one of them was wrong
[1:10:18] and the other was right you know i
[1:10:21] understand one thing that
[1:10:23] if you write and if god you know god
[1:10:26] it's right what you did you don't have
[1:10:28] to debate with anybody
[1:10:30] because god are manifested
[1:10:34] god uh you know
[1:10:36] being wrong you know and trying to
[1:10:38] foster people about this and about that
[1:10:41] why
[1:10:43] leave them alone
[1:10:45] god justify
[1:10:47] if it's of god it'll come if it's not
[1:10:49] ain't gonna come to nothing
[1:10:52] see and it's god vindicating
[1:10:55] because if god called you and if god put
[1:10:58] it on your then god gonna manifest it
[1:11:01] there'll be fruits of your labor
[1:11:04] not just doing something you know like
[1:11:07] popping up with deals and that no
[1:11:09] you you want uh something direct from
[1:11:12] god
[1:11:14] because too many times we have had too
[1:11:16] many shipwrecks
[1:11:18] and that's what people are like they are
[1:11:20] now so much shipwrecked people now can't
[1:11:22] even distance what's right and what's
[1:11:25] wrong
[1:11:28] he said this there
[1:11:32] he said now the only way
[1:11:35] that you could tell which was
[1:11:37] when it comes fundamental to the word
[1:11:40] both of them were right but you see
[1:11:43] one
[1:11:45] his motives and that's one thing you
[1:11:47] already have to check what are your
[1:11:49] motives
[1:11:50] why are you doing what you're doing
[1:11:53] what's the purpose of it
[1:11:56] for glory of your own self or for glory
[1:11:58] of god
[1:11:59] and you know like i said we got some
[1:12:01] real good actors in this hour
[1:12:05] one his mortal was wrong he was trying
[1:12:08] to cut off his brother
[1:12:11] from the line of promise
[1:12:14] that god had gave him
[1:12:16] another thing
[1:12:18] one of the prophet of balaam
[1:12:21] was fundamental
[1:12:23] but the prophet moses
[1:12:25] was identified by characteristics of god
[1:12:30] there was a pillar of fire
[1:12:33] supernatural light hanging over them and
[1:12:37] there was a great healing in their camp
[1:12:40] supernatural god showing supernatural
[1:12:43] signs
[1:12:44] and they were staying right
[1:12:47] exactly
[1:12:48] with the word of promise that god gave
[1:12:52] abraham
[1:12:53] back in the time both nations started
[1:12:56] but now
[1:12:57] notice moses had abraham's promise
[1:13:01] going to the promised land balaam also
[1:13:03] had a prophet of the lord stand there in
[1:13:05] the only way you could identify
[1:13:09] not from their fundamental teaching
[1:13:11] but by the characteristics of god see
[1:13:16] only he said there was a a sound of
[1:13:20] shout of the voice of the king down in
[1:13:23] the camp with here
[1:13:25] the atonement was there
[1:13:28] it was in effect a brass serpent
[1:13:31] see all the supernatural
[1:13:34] characteristics of god
[1:13:36] was being made manifest to identify who
[1:13:40] was right and who was wrong
[1:13:43] and i believe that if those
[1:13:45] characteristics existed then it's the
[1:13:49] same characteristics now
[1:13:51] why because hebrews 13 8 it said that
[1:13:55] jesus christ is
[1:13:58] the same yesterday
[1:14:00] today and forever and if that is then
[1:14:03] god characteristics is still being made
[1:14:06] manifested
[1:14:08] not another jesus
[1:14:11] not another god not three gods but one
[1:14:14] god with three
[1:14:16] uh manifestation
[1:14:18] see
[1:14:19] making
[1:14:20] himself
[1:14:22] known to the people of
[1:14:25] that particular generation
[1:14:28] and god will have those characteristics
[1:14:33] even today on display
[1:14:35] god bless you tonight
[1:14:54] praise god god is identified by his own
[1:14:56] characteristics we thank the lord let us
[1:14:58] bow our heads let us stand
[1:15:03] father in the precious name of jesus
