westgor family God and Father just pray God that you'll be with your people father just touch now heal and deliver in Jesus Christ's name we thank you amen Mark the 10th chapter glad for each and every one of you and those that are listening in and appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ Paul says if in this life we only have hope we're all men most miserable there must be something more than this amen because it's it's it's fading is just we're just here for a moment but while we're here we're making preparation for eternity so by the grace of God as we make our preparation for eternity somewhere we're on when we leave here this body this time that we're here let us only do those things that would be the Everlasting Mark 10 and 17 and when he was gone forth unto the way there came one running and kneeling to him and ask him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there's none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false Witnesses defraud not honor thy father and thy mother he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou liketh go thy way and sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor and thou shall have Treasures in Heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieve for he had great possession God bless read the word you may be seated and I'll just continue on at the 23rd verse and Jesus looked around and said unto his discip deciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God and the disciples were astonished at his word but Jesus answered again and said unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved and Jesus looked upon them and said with men it is impossible but not with God for With God all things are possible then Peter began to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed thee and Jesus answered and said verely I say unto you there is no man that has left houses or Brethren or sister or father mother a wife or children a land for my sake and the gospel but he shall receive aund fold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mother and children and land with persecution and in the world to come eternal life and many that were first shall be last and the last shall be first God bless you reading this word you by the grace of God I chose the topic this morning and I was D in prayer and I on yesterday and it came in my heart forsaken all forsaken all and now many times we we come to places in our life I know was a young man I came to that Crossroad in my life well I looked at life and I didn't see much in the future and on the horizon I didn't see purpose didn't know what I wanted to do didn't know where I wanted to go I really I wanted to be going the military and my hopes was dashed when they said your knee operation wouldn't allow you I said okay what I do with my life what do I do with my life from a child I thought I wanted to serve the Lord but I wanted to experience life first I wanted to first of all let me do all the wrong that I can do inoc sense all the little things that I imagine to do let me get rich and let me do this that and at the end of the road maybe I give I want to serve the Lord I want I really want to go to heaven I want to really want to serve the Lord and I want to go to heaven at the end but let me first of all get all the stuff out the way that I want to do and uh I I imagine that most people figure you know my life is in my hand and I can do what I choose to do so my eternity I can't play I Can't Go to military let me go back to the football so I said okay give that another chance so we wanted to do something with your life you want to think you still can make it so I thought I'll try going by at the same time I come to church and I get baptized and want to serve the Lord still have aspirations when did I give did I forsake all then that question comes down in my heart and you know uh it didn't take much in church to make me kind of you know cuz it's too much hypocrisy too many Hypocrites in the church you know I see so much wrong in the church I see so many people that's faking I can't I can't can't stand that so I just uh people are not real so I found fault in the church because I find fault in the people so I just said well let me just try to y'all would say today chill out let me just going about my business so but what what what what what was my alterity drinking smoking where where I where's my pleasure where's what am I going to enjoy in life what am I going to do with life I can't drink I see what happened to people that drink okay drugs uh-uh I don't want nothing to have power over me smoking no I ain't doing that okay so what do you got you got a world that says smoke get a joint smoke get high snot some coke shoot some Heron what you going to do that for pleasure what are you going to do for Joy you got a choice to me go to church lot of Hypocrites go to Street what am I offer because I got to have some f got to have something to do with my life what am I going to do with it so something had to change something had to change see I didn't try to go to God but I think God came to me amen because just going to church wasn't working so God had to come to me and when he came to me my eyes was open is this what you want is this what you want he actually showed me what I what I was going after he said this is what you want and I says cuz at the end of this this is what you're going to get your soul is going to be lost is that what you want and I says says now who's this that's coming to me and is talking to me because it sound like I'm being confronted with my life I'm being confronted with my life and what I'm going to do with it now am I going to go down that road knowing that I'm going be lost knowing that things are going to happen and it's not going to be good I said okay my only alternative is I believe that this is God that's dealing with my life this is God that's speaking to me this is God that's showing me you don't want to go that way you don't want to go that way I said okay I believe that this is God telling me don't go down that road don't you do it though I was kind of well now it becomes me and God it's no more the the church and the people in the church it's me and God now so now I've come to church I I I don't come to look at what people are doing I come because I want a relationship with him so it doesn't matter what other people doing Hypocrites and false preachers and all of that that don't matter I want a relationship with God so I come and took my Bible from genes started Genesis not understanding even how to read like that because when I went to church yeah we probably look at the Bible this that but just going to church not really getting into the word now I'm really getting down to business getting in the word praying I'm fasting I'm seeking God I'm in the word now here we are now it comes down to the reality forsaken all forsaken all I want the Holy Ghost now I'm praying God fill me with the Holy Ghost and I I'm ready to give it up all now I want the Holy Ghost I just you know I just don't want to come to church I want the Holy Ghost because Lord I'm caught up in in the world and doing things that I you know I didn't want to do and sometimes you cut yourself in a place to do something you thought you never do but you caught up in that place yes amen and somehow getting caught up in the place and doing stuff you thought you'll never do and God said you get me out of that how did I get in that place I almost did something so I said I never do but I got that close and I got out and I said thank you I said oh and then I look back at it I said God must have oh oh God you must was with me and so a lot of times we get in places because we fail to come God's provided way God has provided a way for our lives but sometimes we don't want to go to God's provided way sometimes we trying to just just trying to live and go through life but God has a plan and provided way this young man he came to Jesus because he saw something in Jesus I'm talking about he saw something in God he saw something in Jesus that was different amen amen I trust that you see something in Jesus that's different that's different from everything else that you might view everything else you might see I trust that you see something in Jesus that's different and he this young man saw something different and he realized he said good Master you got something what must I do that I might have eternal life I wonder if it ever dawned on you that it's more the life than see when you get past 35 the second time you realize how short life is it's it it travels so fast and life is so short but what am I living for and what am I doing with this life why am I here and what purpose am I here for what am I here what am I doing in here with this life what am I what am I to do with it because I'm here didn't ask to be here but I am here what am I doing with it is it value is it any value to it and is it is it any value to how I'm conducting my life is it any value what is the outcome of of what I'm doing what what is My outcome what am I looking forward to what is my future in it I look at it and I say the same old same old a little bit more of this and a little bit more of that but it's the same old same old uhuh I it must be something more it must be something more to life than what I'm experiencing it must be something more okay finish school get a job work get a house get a car must be something more than that that's all get a hamburger eat a steak it must be something more is that's all people just happy but me I got to take it more serious it's more serious than that to me because I I can't I can't accept that this is it I can't I just can't deal with this this all it is I can't deal with that this it got to be something more than this so by the grace of God the Young Rich ruler realized it was more it was something he called eternal life and he said I want it shake somebody hand and said do you want eternal life that young man he was rich he went to church he went to church because he said all these I have kept from my youth up he knew God from a a letter standpoint and for religious standpoint he perhaps was a better what y'all would say today a better Christian than most of us you know what I'm saying the man said I never from my youth up all the stuff the other folks did I ain't never done cuz I kept them from my youth up you see what I'm saying so a lot of stuff that we done he ain't never done but yet a lot of stuff you want to do he ain't never done but he wanted eternal life see cuz some of us think you know if I go to to the Lord if I if I go to and give God my heart I ain't going to be able to do this and that and the other this man ain't never done it but yet he saw something he saw need he saw thirst he saw something that he needed that was more than just the money that he had just all that his accumulation nice businessman nice man attitud had everything look like everything that you probably want he had it everything you trying to get he had it then cuz he was rich already he was young and Rich and then he was not just young and Rich but he was a ruler so he had you know he he had position he had status quoe he had everything but he didn't have eternal life that's the thing that he wanted that he didn't have eternal life went to church but he didn't have eternal life look at my life I wanted the Holy Ghost but before I could get the Holy Ghost I had to come to the point I had to give up everything I had to forsake all you know why I wanted the Holy Ghost cuz I knew I needed it I wanted it because I knew I needed it I I I noticed that most people that they go through the motion they come in to be a part of a church and they never that's far as they go young man had all of that but he wanted eternal life in other words he wanted the Holy Ghost he wanted an experience with God it's not enough just to be baptized and just to be in church but I want I want eternal life to get eternal life you know I I can believe on Jesus and accept him as Savior and as Lord but I want to it comes down to the point I want the Holy Ghost I want eternal life I got to what forsake what forsake what Shake somebody hand and tell them forsake all forsake all now you heard you you I read off some of the things that you got to give up see Jesus said if you going to follow me amen if you going to follow me you got to first of all you got to deny what the first thing you got to do is deny yourself are you with me amen but are you willing to deny yourself are you willing to say I'm going to deny my it's a hard thing to do because your biggest enemy is what yourself and you don't want to deal with you don't want to look in the mirror do you you don't want to look in the mirror and say Hey you know you love you don't you love you look at me I know how I used to do one just look in the mirror got to be nice and slim trim and got to have my hair my throw I got to have everything together you know you walk out the door you got to know you got it all going on you know but you got to come to a point you know you want to be cool you want to be you know you you want to you want to be you know you want to be there but you going to deny yourself you don't no longer you you know looking at yourself you know you don't go out looking any kind of way you go out but you says y'all don't want to hear it but you go you you love yourself you're loving yourself you spending the best money to put on the best outfits where you can come out and you know everybody going to pay attention to you yeah they going to pay attention to me because I got it going on you like the comment you like what folks say about you because you you hadn't acknowledge yourself yet hey you you really got it going yeah I got it going on I know I got it going on you know but you got to deny all of those lovely comments deny yourself what you think of yourself who you think you are what you want to be what you what are you trying to show forth what do you want people to see deny yourself you're worrying about your your image you're worrying about how what folks think about you you woring about all of that whether you in The In Crowd whether you cool whether you got game what you know you worrying about all of that all of that stuff didn't matter once you come to Jesus you got to first of all what deny yourself we don't never want to look at because we want to claim that I'm what I'm all right I'm all right I ain't Ain't So what I'm not so bad I I'm cool I I don't do this and I don't do that look at this young man he Ain do none of that he was much more he had his life was far beyond what we talking about you know but Jesus found the thing that was dear to his heart where his treasure was and he told him I want you to have Treasures in Heaven but before you have Treasures in Heaven I want you to what forsake what I want you to forsake all in other words he was saying to him I I want you to give it up I want you to take and I want you to give up what you got all that money you got in the bank all that how I want you to sell all that you have huh huh you talking to me are you talking to huh you said you want eternal life didn't you say you want eternal life you go what what go sell all that you have and give it to who give it to who po y'all y'all heard give it to who the poor the poor I you know I leave it for this and you want me to give it to them give it to who who you talking to you talking to me see some things God talks to you you and in your spirit in your inner self in your spirit man God talks to you and because he knows what it's going to take for you Amen to get eternal life so he speaks to you amen where amen where your treasure is what the thing that you're holding on to that you don't want to give up he speaks to you in that area he not going to tell you that ain't got no money ain't got nothing to give it up all sell all you got and you ain't got nothing to sell you know what I'm saying but he's speaking to where it's going to hurt are you with me now now God would speak to you if if if you truly come to God he's going to speak to you where it's going to hurt you where it's going to cost you something are you with me and see sometimes we want eternal life but we don't want to give up [Music] nothing to to have eternal life you must be willing to give it up but what are you willing to give up for it I don't want to I ain't got okay you got something if it's if it's just your pride your pride see some folk ain't got no money ain't got a penny but they got a whole lot of pride pride about Pride about themselves I got to get Rachel to help me pronounce that word proud a proud Spirit a proud Spirit ain't got no money in the bank you got nothing to boast or brag about but you still got Pride that you're dealing with and God will ask you to give it up sell all that you have sell all forsake it all I want to maybe I spent too much time on forsaking it all but let me tell you something each one of us come to that place that cross and each one of us has to crucify themselves you have to be crucified you have to die to self will and self want and what self needs we have to die to that we have to come to the Cross we got to be willing to forsake all to follow Jesus I think that's the problem with the church there's no sacrificial Lambs there's no people that really want to make sacrifices we don't find even it don't take much for us not to come to church and the little that we give God it's not a really a sacrifice because we don't give to the point that it's a sacrifice our life ourselves it's not really a sacrifice we don't forsake it all we just you know we just we just do enough to to uh as as a Young Rich ruler we just do enough to you know Ser I believe in God I believe the message I believe this and believe that we do enough to get by we do enough to say I'm a Christian to say I I go to church to say I'm saved and say I love the Lord Lord we do just enough to satisfy ourselves but is it enough for God have we forsaken all now just for a moment we go back and look back at Abraham Abraham was asked a question when he was in a the C I want you to leave everything you got here and I want you to come and walk with me and follow me Abraham said huh no Abraham probably thought about it now who is this that's speaking to me some kind of way he must have knew it was some uh the one that was calling him was able to lead him to a better country than the country that he was living in the Bible said Abraham looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God so Abraham sojourned out of his homeland left everything that he had and he didn't know where he was going but he knew who was leading him brother and sister you may not know where you're going if you're forsake all but I know who's asking me to give it up all forsake all I know who's leading me amen must it was something when the the disciples out there and they were fishing and amen Jesus just told him drop your nets and come on follow [Applause] me I mean this is our life living and Peter said Lord we we left all we left our our occupation we left our father mother our wives we left everything we left our children we left everything and we follow you oh what a what a predicament you put your family in a you just left everything and you're going to fall in the master how many of you believe that God provided for their families yes amen when they followed Jesus I believe amen they did the best thing that they could do amen I don't care how many fishes how successful they were fishing I believe that God took care of their family because they followed him are you with me they said Lord we left all we gave it up everything to follow you and see that's what we we we we imagine in our mind if I give up if I forsake all then I'm going to miss out what what's going to happen here what's going to happen now what's going to happen to my life what's going to happen to me what's going to happen no man have forsaken all to follow me and not in this world he said receive what a 100 fold in this world receive 100 fold that means I got 100 fold in the word of come I got more than that because I got what eternal life so brother and sister when you said I forsook all I I gave it up all what you amen you you gave it up but you got eternal life that City that Abraham sojourn looking for I believe one day amen Abraham was able to see the city amen are you with me I I I I believe Amen in his experience with God and his walk with God Amen he got to a place that I said it was worth it all it was worth me giving up everything it was worth me leaving home it was worth me leaving my friends it was worth me leaving everything everything I had to follow Jesus amen I believe there came a time when a young lady's life named Ruth that she came to a place that in her own thirst for God she wanted nobody amen for her it was her own will when her mother-in-law told her amen I want you to stay neomi said stay home and do his off for you know don't he said whether I go I'm going go your people going to be my people and your God my God are you with me because she knew she had come in contact with something that was worth leaving home leaving friends leaving family leaving country leaving everything I come in contact with some is real amen yes amen so Ruth sojourn I said she didn't leave it amen and God did not give her more amen I'm saying brother and sister I'm telling you you don't leave and and God does not give you more amen are you with maybe Moses when he was had opportunity Amen to become the next uh king of Pharaoh in Egypt amen but he was able to leave it on amen amen Leave It All To Be identified with what they call slaves and mud dos amen he left everything because why amen I'm telling you brother and sister may not you may not be able to see it now you may not think it's worth it
