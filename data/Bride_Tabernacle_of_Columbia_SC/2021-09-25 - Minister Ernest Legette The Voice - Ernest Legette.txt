we visited brother brad burgess and he sent his greetings he was out of town with brother andy brother thaddeus and different ones burgess family they sent their regards so by the grace of god we were there in louisville kentucky and um we said tell brother gordon tell us sister dale tell the twins tell us all y'all praise the lord amen because i told them different ones this show to tell them i said okay i'm gonna just in general pray the lord everybody just say pray the lord to y'all and different ones and that know them praise the lord amen if you don't know them they still say praise the lord to the church god bless you um brother gordon was actually a high disservice where the early sex man had a service you know i just thought i'd go and just not let anybody know i was coming and i just slept in sunday morning and i brother andy preached that sunday morning and asked me will i do the afternoon service so we were able to minister that afternoon i hadn't ministered there in years nevertheless he asked me to preach easter meeting for them and i couldn't do it so much too much was going on here so i told him i couldn't come so i thought i don't have to go by there just when you're asking me to preach but you know i like to go visit people even if i'm not ministering let me just go and see your friends see your fellow brothers and sisters amen so by the grace of god anyway we ministered that sunday night and the presence of god came down in in in a supernatural way and the people were you know it was just they couldn't leave out the presence it they just sat and they were daddies came up to lead songs and the musicians everybody got spelled by and the holy ghost was just all over the church tongues interpretation and just the presence of god which is i was putting it close to the level that when we're in south africa and how the presidency got just settled in the place and um so we it's so much they were telling me so many so much supernatural took place till i just sat down and just i was just listening and they would well can you do money tuesday wednesday no no no no no no i just i just take a little break a little break but can you come back can you come back and run run revive what can you do i said well the lord knows just let me let me just come down for a little bit but ask you to continue pray for us and pray for them and um just try to give you just a little synopsis a little report but by the grace of god let's just keep praying the same god is everywhere god is moving god is blessing so um i told him just a little simple message we shared on friday here i was on that same line but something supernatural happened saturday night while i was in the hotel and i got up that morning and i was telling caleb about it and then and showing off what i was telling him about i was i was listening to a conversation and there was some ministers and i was listening to them talk every now and then that happened to me and i said caleb you know what happened some hours before i got up i said i'm so i'm here laying down listening to people talk about me i said and i'm hearing him clear i say oh okay and she'll know her father that you said brother simmons it's just what you heard i said exactly he said somebody was talking about you i said and i kind of shared that with them that i was to listen and every now and then those type things happen and sometimes sometimes they happen often sometimes you just don't have so that was one thing that was so amazing and so supernatural and that he knew he knew immediately when i said that i heard some ministers and it was satan and i heard what they were saying and you know it's striking how god could come on the scene and do things in the midst of people and um god bless you now i better get out the way i might talk too much ernie's got a minister tonight but god is good let's just keep praying keep trusting god and i said god will it's nothing that god would not do for you and i and i believe that i'm waiting to hear further testimonies from what god did in that kind of presence because in the presence when god's presence come down anything can happen healings miracles that people don't even know about two days later they didn't well god did this for me you know god did that for me it was something about the sermon some things i said a sister was saying to her daddy just said her and her hug she was saying for weeks and months almost the lord had put some of those things and her husband was just talking about it she was telling the lord was dealing with me on that particular sermon and that's the words that i was saying and and it just it just caused people just to know that god was dealing with them too and know that god is speaking to them may god bless you let us sing that song amazing grace let's stand receive the speaker tonight our brother earnestly good [Music] um [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hey man you appreciate what the lord is doing

our brother e lord oh god it's good to hear his voice lord today and oh god to the strength back lord i just pray you to continue lord touching him and oh god there's so many lord that asks for prayer

you lord that you would forgive us just now help us lord to be reconciled unto you lord bless their children god bless the word god i pray you might open it up lord and it might be god bread from heaven something oh god that would give us so god's strength for the lord from day to day lord we thank you lord hallelujah lord we love you in the name of jesus christ amen and amen god is good amen we want to look at the book of saint john by god's grace saint john 10. try not to hold you alone saint john 10 and we'll begin at the first verse you got to say amen and it reads verily verily i say unto you he that enter not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth into in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he called his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he put forth his own sheep he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers may god has blessed to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight by god's grace just for a moment i want to minister to you on a little topic and you know i ministered on it about a week or so ago and i i entitled it the voice amen the voice you know here you know the scriptures declaring that jesus was declaring here he says you know the shepherd he entered he entered then by the porter and the porter opened up to him and he said in his sheep hear his voice and he called us his own sheep by name and he leaded them out you know it's something about you know the voice of god and and the call like he says he called them by name it's something about you know so sometimes you don't understand where you're going at or where you was where you're moving or what particularly drew you but one it had to be a certain point in your life to where you hear that voice and what did that voice do that voice begin to draw you i like how it says here he says at the shepherd he says he knows his sheep by name come on god knows your name says he called them not only does he call them but the bible here declares that he leadeth them out you know god when god calls a man he don't just call him and just leave him out there like that but he leads that man come on and sometimes you don't understand like it says you don't understand where you're going but nevertheless that voice that same voice that calls you is the same voice that's going to lead you and actually like it says here in the scriptures that the sheep he says that they they follow the shepherd come on he says they know his voice and a stranger they will not follow so what do we find you know even today i says that all over the land what's happening is the voice of god is going out come on through the ministry through whatever the lord uh intends to use but nevertheless the voice of god is going out and what is it is we we don't look many times as to say as calling groups but it's calling individuals it's calling those by name and we saw that on many cases or many uh uh uh circumstances that god he never lost one come on but he knows the bible says them that are his so in in knowing that resting assurance of that that hey he never lost one and he showed us that over and over again that no matter where that individual were no matter where where what kind of condition they were in or what had them bound when he called their name they had to come forth look at even in the natural lazarus being locked up in the tomb amen but when god called his name what happened not even the chains of death could hold him could it you know he even says in one place i like how it stirred me up how he says lose some and let him go come on i says what it is we look at so many times in individuals how the devil had had individuals lives abound and had shackles or grips and strongholds on people but there's no grip and i'm a firm believer of that there's no grill there's no stronghold that the devil can have on your life tonight that when that voice of god begins to call you that it won't it won't have no other choice but to let go all it takes is you hearing that voice i was praying i said lord uh give us ears to hear lord to hear what you're saying you know we're living in the darkest hour ever known right says in in this age all it wouldn't be no light it would be a total darkness right and in the midst of that total darkness you know when you look when you think about darkness you can't see your way i got up even last night and in the room and walking and you know you just couldn't couldn't see and i was thinking about that walking and tripping over everything about the fall just to go a few feet why because you couldn't see and you think about in the hour that we live in the darkness i said it's so dark you can't even go a few feet without him leading you you can't make it nowhere without god leading you come on and what it is you says what am i following i'm following that voice that which is calling me come on i'm heeding the call i said he knows you by name come on he called you he said that's that shepherd he know he i know my sheep by name and i call him and i'm gonna lead him out come on i said how are you gonna make it out of this hour how are you gonna make it out of the condition of the world today god is gonna have to lead you out i find myself even now all the time praying saying lord lead me lead me lord come on and i'll follow why because god i don't know where i'm going i asked the lord even when it comes down to raising children i was on my knees yesterday i said god i don't know how to handle situations i don't know what to do god and you see sometimes them growing up and going on i said lord i need your leadership i said god lead me because you can't get it all figured out you can't protect them you can't put a bubble around them come on and all those things but if the blood is applied come on and that's what we're depending on come on the blood of jesus christ to cover them come on and i said lord lead me how many want the lord to lead them tonight but i said what it is it's the voice come on i like that and i'll just just just dwell dwell on that so much he says you know in in many scriptures especially i think the psalms 29 talking about the voice of the lord and how powerful the voice of the lord is and how it breaks cedars and how it breaks come on i said the voice of the lord it breaks yokes it breaks strongholds come on what do we need tonight we need the voice of god what do we need in our homes we need the voice of god what do we need in our everyday lives we need the voice of the lord come on to do what lead us out hallelujah do you believe that tonight i says what it is his voice is something about the voice of god the voice of god has drawn abilities you know i was thinking about a friend of mine and the lord just recently saved him and how you know was talking with him and it's something about how encouraging it is to talk to him because he's sharing things with me encouraging me of what the lord has been doing for him and i says what it is i could have witnessed to him all with every breath that's in me but it wouldn't have did no good sometimes but all it took is the voice of the lord to be again calling them he might can't explain to you what happened to him but all he know is one day his heart began to turn and that's what i pray even here tonight come on sometimes we we struggle and do all our best to try to win people but i said lord let their heart begin to turn do something in their spirit and their heart begin to turn and when their heart begins to turn you watch god in those drawing abilities all we do is do what preach the gospel live the life let that voice go out hallelujah and i believe that voice will draw them they might not even know what's taking place even on the inside of them but they know that they're coming forth hallelujah oh jesus but i believe that in order for them to hear that voice come on they had to be predestinated and ordained of god and god began calling on them hallelujah but somewhere in their heart i believe they always had a desire just to be saved and a desire to live for god but situations sometimes hands are life and the way they were born sometimes had them bound but nevertheless that didn't stop the election of god hallelujah how could he write their name there how could he write your name there because he already knew what was in you he knew the seed that he planted inside of you so wherever you were hallelujah god sought you out he began to call you where art thou hallelujah oh jesus and you heard that voice didn't you come on i believe that how many believe that tonight let's look at romans 8 by god's grace i said the voice come on the voice it has eight and 28 it has drawn abilities and i said abilities and that's no matter what uh condition that person is in you know it's something about it's just those little things i i begin to look over you know as a deep call to the deep come on it's something down in the deep uh uh behind be a ponder beyond all of the darkness beyond all of the other noise and the clutter that might be around your life nevertheless when that deep began to call it's got abilities to reach beyond all that clutter come on reach beyond you and you know how that deep call does i think about moses though you know he might have been next in line to be pharaoh but there's something about it the bible says he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter didn't he come on but he chose rather to suffer the affliction of god rather to enjoy the bible says the pleasures of sin for a season what can make moses give it up come on what would make him turn around and forsake all and fall after christ the voice hallelujah something on the inside it was a deep calling he was yearning for something better than what this life had to offer and i said even tonight what do we have to do it's something inside of us yearning for something better than what this life got to offer you know many times what the devil does he put all kind of things before you don't he all kind of opportunities like they say come on things and ways to make more money and get more gain in this life but that deep call come on something is calling out people look at you sometimes and say you crazy and all these things and you passing away passing up but you've given these things up because you know that there's a better something out there come on there's something else calling you drawing you out how many believe that tonight what it is it's the voice of god when you begin to hear that voice you say here i am lord speak let me know what you want out of my life all i want to do god is your will how many want the will of god tonight but i said that voice come on what it is calling i believe that you know i'm so stirred that's why it says no matter we've seen that proven many times no matter what condition a person was in come on god god had a way of going by and getting those that are his god had a way of swooping like he says he had need to go by that way god god saw a need why he saw his seed and he wasn't going to lose not one so he had a need in his eye he had to go by that way hallelujah he had to deviate sometimes they looked like from the path they was on i got to go by that way why because there's one over there i got to get hallelujah oh jesus i'm so glad he deviated to come get me how many believe that tonight aren't you glad that god saw need one day to come by and see about you in your condition when you might ain't even been thinking about him but he heard your hearts cry hallelujah he saw a seed there god recognized you oh jesus when he saw you he recognized you i'm glad god recognized me oh jesus hallelujah i'm so glad that god knew my name and called me and i heard that voice say how did you come forth i heard that voice i heard him call me one day hallelujah and that's when i was able to come forth how are you able to come forth tonight god calls you come on he called you by name how'd you get where you are he led you out how you gonna get to where he wants you to be he gonna lead you there hallelujah how many believe that tonight oh jesus divorce come on that says here in romans eight like i said you know it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter what condition uh the seat of god find themselves in come on it's something about god is going to get you where you need to be at and once we realize that that the battle that we're faced with come on you are already victorious he said uh you know you overcome the world because he already overcame it the battle that you fought that you fighting he already won for you come on all we do all we're doing we going through this life and we know that but we know that god has already won the battle for us so what are we doing we're praising god on our way how many how many believe that said romans 8 and 28 is very familiar he says and we know come on that all things work together for what for the good to them that what love god and them that and them who are what called come on i said did you hear his voice come on once you hear that voice he said we know come on i can see paul uh here trying to encourage them because we got so many clouds of witnesses letting you know come on this ain't something that we hoping but we know hallelujah that all things is going to work together for the good of them that love god come on do we have to share that testimony come on we got so many of them we know that all things are going to work together god never failed not one time and he ain't gonna fail now when the odds was against them when it looks like all hope was lost come on god showed up didn't he he came to the rescue for them that he called and in the midst of of what looked like a mess in the whole world coming down on them come on it worked together for their good god took the mess and he did something graded out of it hallelujah oh it worked together didn't he say that to them that are called come on according to his what purpose for for whom he did for no he also did what predestinate and then he also called come on we're talking about the voice he said damn he for new i got i was saying the other week god already knew you he already knew you come on when you came before you came before you even was falling in your mother's womb that's like you told jeremiah i already knew who you were come on i already called you in a danger come on to be a prophet to the nations all these things the ain't just uh starting now but it was always been working come on and i said once once we realized that that this ain't just started but he says he already foreknew you come on he already predestinated you come on he already called you come on he says predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did for destiny then enemy also called come on that voice is something about that voice come on he calls you why because he already predestinated you come on he he put i see in you before the world even began you were in god's mind come on you say i i can't never glory in myself and say i got anywhere on my own come on but it was all him from the beginning this is his working and what he's doing hallelujah so i'm glad that god thought about me i'm glad that god had me in his mind hallelujah no i can't live good enough i'm just enjoying what god has done for me i'm just enjoying the election and the calling of god hallelujah oh that voice when i heard that voice oh jesus i was glad to hear that voice i'm so glad they sing a song that the lord brought me out hallelujah oh if it had not been for jesus tell me where would i be oh jesus hallelujah i pray you got that testimony tonight come on i said if it had not been for jesus i'm so glad that the lord brought me out are you glad that the lord brought you out hallelujah oh jesus out of sin and shame come on darkness all these things i was thinking about today a guy he told me a while back he was ordained minister but lately the conversations i've been hearing him talk about come on and i says man i said that that's that's a shame well i told him i said but what it is you know you got to have a conversion it's more than just saying that okay god called you come on many are called but few are what chosen come on i said what it is you got to have a conversion god's got to do something for you on the inside come on you might be able to take this the bible and seeing that you know gifts and callings or without repentance and all those things i said but i thank god for conversion i thank god that all things have become new that that the old man come on i put out the old man and put on the new man i thank god for the new man tonight how many thank god tonight oh jesus come on he says that for him he did he did foreign them he also called whom he called he and whom he justified he also what glorified says what shall we say then to these things if god be for us who can be against us come on i said the voice has called you come on i like that little verse there how it says them that he called he also justified come on you know i always tell the testimony how when i first got saved and you know it's something about how when i come into the house of god you know even though the lord called you the devil always want to put things and keep things hedges over your head and all these things that want to keep you bound up come on but i said god is here tonight to unhook those chains i remember when i first got saved and i had a lot of weights on me come on come in the house of god the dog though my heart wanted to worship i had weights that was holding me down but i remember talking to pastor simmons here one day in the in the office and and and he i began to tell him that how i had these weights on me and things that was holding me down and i was sorry for a lot of things that i had done in my life but i remember him having a little talk with me saying that you know god knew you was going to take that first smoke before you even took that first smoke god knew you was going to take that drink before you took that first drink god knew you was gonna lie cheating all these things before you even done it he says but even before that the lamb was already slain for you hallelujah and the blood was already said he said he said you can't go back and make right everything you did you might be in jail the rest of your life come on you can't it's impossible to go back and make everything right he said you got to let the cross do something for you hallelujah oh jesus you know i remember that and i says one thing i always tell the testimony when he was telling me that in his back office over there i felt something lift off of me oh jesus when i walked out the office i felt i felt like a new man then i felt like i was free to go worship the lord hallelujah but what it is the recognizing that hey god already calls you he calls you come on he already justified you don't worry about how you gonna get to that glorified state god's gonna take you there hallelujah why because he called oh jesus hallelujah i said what are you faced with tonight come on what are you battling tonight you know the devil like you said want to keep those hedges off you he don't want you to be free to worship the living god he want to keep you bound a little bit he don't want you to be free to worship the living god because he knows that when you get into in the true worship he know when you begin to worship in god like he like he needs to be worshipped come on like like like like we we owe him our praise and we begin on worshiping god in that thankfulness lord i thank you for saving me god i thank you for dying for me lord i'm so glad god just for me i'm glad you came and died when you begin to worship in god with real worship he knows hallelujah that chains will start being unhooked things will lift off your life hallelujah demon powers will be broken he knows that when you worship god right that healing is going to take place when you worship god right hallelujah northern it'll fill your home hallelujah it'll stretch out to your children and all those that around you when you worship god right oh jesus so what he does tries to keep that hedge on come on keep things clouding in your mind come on when you come in the house of god i don't want you to worship do it thinking about things that happened during the

probably some more material out there i said i read a lot of other material myself i said but i believe that everything we need hallelujah is right here in the book i said everything you need to make the journey is hearing the book i said so long as you stay in the book you can't go wrong come on and i said that everything i began to share with them i said everything just like how it says time would fail to tell everybody's story everything that jesus done wasn't recorded i don't believe that in the bible but i says that he gave us enough to stir us up i remember me and uh brother sam was was talking about uh you know a wild bike we were saying that you know as as we can't even uh uh uh uh inject digest all of what god is but when we get to that other side and as a time or not in time but eternally begins to unfold and unfold we'll be forever learning forever learning about who he is and we're saying that if we so stirred with what we got now what how we gonna be when he when he keeps unfolding himself when he keeps uh assuring us who he is i says if we're excited about it now what it'll be in that new jerusalem hallelujah i don't know about you but i i'm stirred i said i
