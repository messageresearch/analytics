[18:53] in his safety even in the midst of a
[18:57] [Music]
[19:08] pandemic
[19:11] [Music]
[19:22] so
[19:24] he that dwelleth
[19:28] in the secret
[19:32] place of the
[19:38] high god
[19:41] shall abide in
[19:44] his grace
[19:49] and he
[19:52] that walketh
[19:55] through the valley
[19:59] of death
[20:01] [Music]
[20:02] shall in no wise be
[20:06] entangled by god's hand he
[20:10] shall be cared
[20:17] so if i go into
[20:21] the heavens god knows
[20:26] [Music]
[20:28] and if i go into
[20:32] the secret place he
[20:36] knows
[20:40] and no matter what
[20:45] may come my way i'm
[20:48] covered by god's blood
[20:54] even when satan
[20:57] seems to rage
[21:00] by god's hand i remain
[21:05] safe
[21:08] cause i'm in his safety
[21:14] dwell in his safety
[21:21] in the same
[21:31] cause i mean god
[21:35] saved him
[21:38] dwell in his safety
[21:43] [Music]
[21:51] the lord
[21:55] because he is the
[21:59] captain
[22:02] of my soul
[22:05] [Music]
[22:08] he is my forehead
[22:13] [Music]
[22:18] [Music]
[22:20] and when the storms of
[22:24] life begin to
[22:28] rage in my life
[22:31] i run into
[22:35] the man stares
[22:43] [Music]
[22:49] oh yes i am cause he hides
[22:55] [Music]
[23:04] i know i'm safe i'm
[23:09] saved me
[23:22] [Music]
