[32:30] than anything.
[32:39] Love you more than anything.
[32:42] We thank God for everyone to press your
[32:44] way out tonight in Jesus Christ's name.
[32:46] And those that are listening in as we
[32:48] stand for the reading of the word, let
[32:50] us bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[32:52] And if you have a special request, you
[32:53] can make it known by uplifting your
[32:55] hand. Father, in the precious name of
[32:58] Jesus, we thank you for another day's
[33:01] journey. Lord, thank you for watching
[33:04] over us. Thank you for keeping us, Lord
[33:07] God. Thank you, oh God, for blessing us
[33:09] to see this day, oh God, for this is the
[33:13] day the Lord has made. I will rejoice
[33:15] and I'll be glad in it. So, Father, I
[33:18] pray, God, that you'll touch those that
[33:20] are on the prayer list, those that have
[33:22] hands lifted and have needs, oh God, may
[33:25] you meet every need according to your
[33:27] riches and glory. May you heal the sick.
[33:30] Amen. May you look upon uh oh God our
[33:33] sister oh God that's uh Lord God going
[33:36] through trials and tribulations Lord and
[33:40] father sickness and cancer and all kind
[33:43] of diseases Lord and look upon all those
[33:46] that ask us to pray for them Lord Lord
[33:49] God we lift them up now in Jesus' name.
[33:53] Father bless the people of God tonight
[33:56] with the word of God. Amen.
[34:04] God is good. I thought about some names
[34:07] that people call and text and so forth.
[34:12] And we were lifting those people up in
[34:14] prayer, but I don't want to call their
[34:16] names out like that. But by the grace of
[34:19] God, we still lifting those different
[34:22] needs up
[34:24] with so many afflictions and sicknesses
[34:26] in the land. Well, 2 Corinthians 5 and
[34:30] 7. 2 Corinthians 5 and7
[34:36] says,
[34:37] "We walk by what?"
[34:40] &gt;&gt; And not by what?
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Sight.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. God bless. Reading the
[34:44] word. You may be seated.
[34:48] We walk by faith and not by sight.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the subject is faith or sight
[34:55] or walking by faith or walking by sight.
[35:01] Whether we know it or not,
[35:04] subconsciously
[35:06] often times people even that say we're
[35:10] Christians, a lot of times we
[35:14] want to see it before we believe it.
[35:16] Amen.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times we trust have more
[35:21] confidence in our five senses than we
[35:24] have
[35:26] in the sixth sense which is faith.
[35:29] We believe our sight more than we
[35:32] believe our faith.
[35:36] And we know that faith in Hebrews 11:1
[35:38] is the substance of things hoped for. It
[35:41] is the evidence of things not seen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we talking about faith,
[35:48] we're talking about is it's opposite of
[35:51] sight. We don't have to see to believe.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; We have to believe and we'll see.
[36:00] So
[36:01] by the grace of God,
[36:05] prophet of God was saying some things
[36:06] here. He said as today's church is full
[36:09] of mental believers.
[36:12] He said, "The day church is full of
[36:14] mental believers
[36:17] who endorse the virgin birth, the shed
[36:21] blood,
[36:22] going to church, taking communion, and
[36:26] are not reborn at all."
[36:31] Even so, in the third age, the pilgrim's
[36:35] age was the same problem.
[36:39] human faith
[36:41] wasn't enough.
[36:44] Then it is not enough now. It takes the
[36:50] very faith of God, the son of God, to
[36:55] drop into a man's heart so that he can
[37:00] receive the Lord of glory into the
[37:03] temple and not made with hands.
[37:08] It takes
[37:10] let's go to Galatian to look at this.
[37:13] What what was said Galatians 2
[37:16] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. We don't want to
[37:19] talk about walking by faith or by sight.
[37:23] We said we walk by faith not by sight.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; But I it's just that we say that
[37:31] but are we really doing it? Are we
[37:34] walking by faith or are we walking by
[37:37] sight?
[37:40] Now our mouth might say we are and
[37:45] mentally
[37:48] we have a mental faith.
[37:51] Um
[37:53] and that mental faith is that we confess
[37:57] with our mouth but don't believe it in
[38:00] our heart.
[38:02] But if we confess with our mouth and
[38:04] believe it in our heart,
[38:07] then God will
[38:10] do something for us.
[38:15] Sometimes we have to stand so firm
[38:19] even if he said Abraham against hope yet
[38:23] believed in hope.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Then they said, "Abraham
[38:27] staggered not at the promises of God
[38:30] through unbelief, but he was strong in
[38:33] faith."
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Believing that what God has promised,
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; He was able to perform it.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; We must believe that God can perform
[38:42] what he said.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; But if we believe it in our intellect,
[38:49] it won't hold out.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; For your faith will be tested and it
[38:53] will be tried.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's real and genuine, it'll
[38:57] hold out.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; But it's not your faith. He's saying the
[39:02] problem of God is bringing out. It's not
[39:04] your faith. As Habaca said, the just
[39:07] shall live by
[39:08] &gt;&gt; his faith.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; His faith.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Not your faith, but his faith.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; So, Galatians 2:20 here says,
[39:20] he says, "I'm crucified to Christ.
[39:23] Nevertheless, what
[39:25] &gt;&gt; I live. But he won't he wants you to put
[39:27] emphasis. Yeah. He says, "Yet not I."
[39:33] You know, it it's not me that's living
[39:36] now
[39:37] &gt;&gt; because I've been crucified.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Because I'm dead. I've been crucified. I
[39:43] died.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; We have to by faith in what Jesus did
[39:50] for us on Calvary.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:52] when he took our place on the cross.
[39:55] When we should have died and went to
[39:57] hell, Jesus did it for us.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; He died in our place.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; So Paul says, "I am crucified with
[40:05] Christ. Nevertheless, I live." But he
[40:08] caught himself. He said, "Yet not
[40:12] &gt;&gt; not I."
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. We got to realize
[40:16] it's not, you know, it's not us that's
[40:19] kind that's living this life.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; That we cannot live the life.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE DO, we'll
[40:28] never be able to live the life.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; So Paul said, "IT'S NOT I."
[40:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm crucified with Christ."
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAYS, "WE MUST DIE DAILY."
[40:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It must be a daily dying out.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Don't let sin reign.
[40:53] Don't let sin have dominion over you.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Because Amen.
[41:01] WE HAVE TO DIE OUT TO OURSELVES and our
[41:04] own will.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't know how to adjust
[41:08] and uh maneuver through this life. We it
[41:12] it has to be something beyond us because
[41:15] if we trying to, you know, do and know
[41:18] how to do it because we're in this
[41:20] fleshly body, this carnal body and you
[41:22] got and and the flesh calls for food. It
[41:25] calls for water. It calls for you to go
[41:28] to work and and get a job and all of
[41:31] these things and then you you it calls
[41:34] for those things to take care of your
[41:36] human responsibility. Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; But there's A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WHERE
[41:41] IS the human responsibility?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Even everything we do and everything,
[41:46] Amen. we try to achieve in life, WE MUST
[41:49] ALLOW GOD, GOD, YOU DO IT.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; I GOT TO SAY, LORD, YOU DO IT. It's your
[41:55] will.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; When I'm walking, when I wake up in the
[41:58] morning, it's because of your grace and
[42:00] your love TOWARDS ME.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; EVERY STEP AND EVERY move that I made.
[42:04] Amen.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said in him we move.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have our being.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God. Amen. Is causing us to

[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; So we give him all the honor and glory.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Everything that is done, we do it in the
[42:24] name of Jesus.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether it be in word or whether
[42:29] it be in deed, whatever you do, do it in
[42:32] his name.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can't do it in his name,
[42:37] Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Then it's wrong.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now,
[42:43] it's because our reasoning and our human
[42:48] intelligence and our intellectual mind
[42:51] that we do things that are contrary to
[42:54] faith. And because we walk by so much of
[42:58] these five senses and we let them
[43:01] control us, it's because we Amen. uh are
[43:06] are not guided by the spirit of God.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; That's why we got to walk in the spirit
[43:13] and we got to live in the spirit. We
[43:15] need the Holy Ghost. And without the
[43:17] Holy Ghost, we won't be able to live and
[43:21] walk in the spirit.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And walk by faith.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] Amen.

[43:32] Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but
[43:35] what?
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Christ."
[43:36] &gt;&gt; And that's what we see. If you know
[43:39] who's living,
[43:41] it's not me that's living now because I
[43:44] surrendered my life to him. And I said,
[43:47] "God, you take control of this vessel."
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. It's not me living
[44:47] anymore. It's not you should be living
[44:50] anymore. It should be Christ living.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The life that I'm living, I'm
[44:56] living. Amen. Because he lives.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; I can face tomorrow.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's him. Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; That's living this life.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. It says, "I'm crucified with
[45:11] Christ. Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I,
[45:14] but what?"
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Christ liveth in me.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?

[53:28] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. in this age.
[53:34] Now,
[53:35] by the grace of God, if we go a little
[53:38] further,
[53:40] we walk by
[53:42] faith, not by sight. Numbers 13.
[53:47] I know it's familiar, but I just want to
[53:49] see whether we can just make it simple,
[53:53] but
[53:55] it may be a rehearsal,
[53:58] but nevertheless, it's real.
[54:03] See,
[54:05] sometimes we can't see our way.
[54:09] Sometimes we can't
[54:12] see, we can't understand it.
[54:17] what God all the blessings and promises
[54:20] God g made us and gave to us.
[54:25] Sometimes it's things in our way to
[54:27] block and to blind us and to us
[54:30] and to hinder us. Things in our lives
[54:33] that we are looking at because our five
[54:36] senses have told us different from what
[54:38] the word of God has said.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can listen to your five senses
[54:44] or you can listen to God.
[54:49] The God that loves you. Love, faith
[54:52] workketh by love.
[54:55] You can listen to the word or you can
[54:57] listen to your five senses. What you
[55:00] hear, what you see.
[55:03] You know, a lot of times people talk
[55:05] themselves out of heaven.
[55:08] They're so busy concerned about the
[55:10] preacher, concern of hearing about the
[55:11] sister and brother and everything. They
[55:13] keep their mouth blinging blah blah blah
[55:16] blah blah blah blah
[55:19] and they talk theirel right out of
[55:20] heaven. Are you with me? And what
[55:24] they're talking about? They're talking
[55:25] about the five senses.
[55:27] They're not talking about maturely
[55:29] mature things.
[55:32] Amen. Being a part of God.
[55:35] Whatsoever things are lovely. Whatsoever
[55:37] things what?
[55:42] Whatsoever things appear. Get it fast.
[55:44] Fast. Philippians 4. What? Hey.
[55:47] Whatsoever things are what?
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Rachel, you got to get it right fast.
[55:53] Okay.
[55:55] Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things
[55:57] are what?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things are what?
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things are what?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; And whatsoever things are what?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Pure.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And whatsoever things are what?
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Lovely. And whatsoever things what
[56:08] &gt;&gt; and whatsoever things and and if there
[56:10] be what
[56:11] &gt;&gt; if there be
[56:14] &gt;&gt; what?
[56:16] &gt;&gt; So instead of thinking on those things
[56:18] we we talk ourselves out of heaven. We
[56:22] thinking on
[56:24] and then we talk about what we thinking
[56:28] because a word is a thought.
[56:31] When you when you speak it is what
[56:33] you're thinking.
[56:34] As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is
[56:37] he. Isn't that right?
[56:39] &gt;&gt; So we speak on things. It it tells us
[56:42] what what realm we in, how much maturity
[56:45] we got. Amen. If a person was judging
[56:49] your speech and they were English
[56:52] teacher, they could tell what level you
[56:54] on.
[56:56] Are you with me? If he was a
[56:58] mathematician, they could tell, Amen.
[57:00] whether you can do calculus or whether
[57:02] you can do oh whatever these things are.
[57:06] You know, they can tell what level you
[57:08] on. So, spiritually speaking, God wants
[57:12] you to be on a level that you're above
[57:14] the world. You're no more of the in this
[57:18] world. You're no more of this world.
[57:19] You're in the world, but you're not of
[57:21] the world.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; You're not living in this dimension
[57:24] anymore.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; You're in heavenly places in Christ.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The love of God just engulfs you.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to surround you with his
[57:35] angels.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And his love, he wants to re radiate. He
[57:40] wants to reflect him his love and use
[57:44] you. Amen. Just like rays of love,
[57:47] &gt;&gt; rays of life.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. People can feel Amen. As as Caleb
[57:53] said on Sunday, Amen. the the the the

[58:01] realm, amen, that they didn't allow
[58:03] these things, amen, to hinder them.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Can you see somebody coming up to Peter?
[58:10] Peter, you know, somebody said something
[58:11] about you, man. I ain't got time for
[58:15] that.
[58:17] Amen.
[58:19] See, Peter wouldn't even entertain that
[58:22] &gt;&gt; because he's in another dimension. If he
[58:25] took time off of that, it'll bring him
[58:27] down to their level.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; I said we talking about getting out of
[58:31] here.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And all the time people trying to bring
[58:36] you down,
[58:38] not people, spirits.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let people bring you down.
[58:43] Keep your head up high.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; And say hallelujah anyhow.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Somebody trying to bless you
[58:50] and you Amen. looking at it as being
[58:53] somebody trying to tear you down.

[58:58] should persecute you and speak all
[59:00] manner of evil against you."
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right, Father?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Then be happy.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Instead of being happy, we
[59:09] entertain it.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; It takes us down to another level.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll get on that. It takes you

[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; And they went and came to Moses.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; He sent out the spies to spot in the
[1:00:05] land or in the promised land. And they
[1:00:08] went and came to Moses, and to Aaron,

[1:00:24] unto the land where the thou sentest us,
[1:00:27] and surely it flowed with milk and
[1:00:29] honey.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; See, God promised them that land. He
[1:00:32] said, it flows with milk and honey. And
[1:00:33] God said, I give it to you.

[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; That was shed for you.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Don't you start thinking that you got
[1:01:46] something to do with this journey.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; If God said it's yours, you just got to
[1:01:50] believe what God says.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; If God say you got the victory, you just

[1:11:03] then um Florence
[1:11:06] and uh
[1:11:08] he a month before that he was they gave
[1:11:11] him up to die but he came through and
[1:11:13] got up and he made his funeral
[1:11:16] arrangements and everything
[1:11:18] and he said to his wife and family
[1:11:22] because you know there are a lot of
[1:11:24] women ministers
[1:11:27] and he said
[1:11:29] she said he said I I I want no woman me
[1:11:32] preaching over me.
[1:11:35] He said, "I want
[1:11:38] I want my pastor, Brother Simmons." He
[1:11:41] He preached my mom a funeral.
[1:11:44] He He began to remember where he came
[1:11:46] from. He remembered the foundation that
[1:11:49] has been laid. He remembered the word
[1:11:53] and he got everything straight how he
[1:11:55] wanted it
[1:11:58] before he left here.
[1:12:00] I believe God restored him,
[1:12:04] brought him back to get everything
[1:12:06] straight.
[1:12:09] And I had to preach his funeral.
[1:12:12] But
[1:12:14] God may not give you that opportunity.

[1:12:19] straight.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; You got an opportunity to repent of your
[1:12:22] sin.

[1:12:28] in the name of Jesus Christ, be baptized
[1:12:31] in the name of Jesus Christ for the

[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; You got an opportunity
[1:12:45] to give your life to God. Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; But if you're walking by sight, you
[1:12:50] looking at the things of this world and
[1:12:53] the car of this life and tomorrow is not

[1:13:22] Bow.
[1:13:25] Heavenly Father,
[1:13:27] Lord, we heard your word tonight, Lord,
[1:13:30] to walk by faith and not by sight. But
[1:13:34] we got a choice to make
[1:13:36] whether we're going to believe you or
[1:13:39] whether we going to go with what this
[1:13:42] five senses tell us.
[1:13:45] as he was saying, uh, we got to let go
[1:13:48] of our own thoughts
[1:13:50] cuz our thoughts are not your thoughts.
[1:13:52] Our ways are not yours. They're so much
[1:13:55] higher.
[1:13:57] God, I pray
[1:14:00] as the word went forth tonight,
[1:14:04] Lord, as we're trying, oh God,
[1:14:08] to get out of the way,
[1:14:12] Lord, and to burst loosen to that realm
[1:14:15] of faith,
[1:14:17] oh God, to where all things are
[1:14:19] possible.
[1:14:22] I believe it's RIGHT THERE.
[1:14:25] RIGHT THERE WAITING on you to reach out
[1:14:28] and grab it.
[1:14:30] You can be healed tonight.
[1:14:33] YOU CAN BE DELIVERED TONIGHT.

[1:14:46] by. How many want to reach out and touch
[1:14:49] him tonight?
[1:14:51] How many don't mind lifting their hands
[1:14:53] and say, "Lord, I want to touch you.
[1:14:57] Lord, I want TO TOUCH YOU. I NEED A
[1:15:00] BLESSING.
[1:15:01] I NEED YOU TO HEAL ME.

[1:19:08] little something I was going to minister
[1:19:10] on. Lord, will I minister on it Sunday?

[1:19:16] fear. Amen. Choosing faith over fear.
[1:19:20] Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; And my main one of my main scripture I
[1:19:23] was going to read was Numbers 13. Amen.

[1:19:50] time.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even when the devil comes in
[1:19:53] your mind, even tonight, Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I was thinking, I said, even when the
[1:19:59] devil comes to your mind with things,
[1:20:02] all you got to do is look back at what
[1:20:04] God already done.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is revisit some of
[1:20:09] them dark nights that God brought you
[1:20:10] up.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to go back to the
[1:20:13] times where you didn't know how you
[1:20:16] COULDN'T SEE YOUR WAY. COME ON. AMEN.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And and and just remind yourself of
[1:20:20] where God brought you from.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; And say, God, if you done that,
[1:20:24] Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I always talk about David. That's what
[1:20:27] it is. You got to revisit. David
[1:20:29] revisited those those days in the
[1:20:32] wilderness with those sheep, didn't he?
[1:20:34] And he says, "Come on. Every time a a a
[1:20:36] mountain or trial come, you it might be
[1:20:39] big. The devil throw it there. You look
[1:20:41] at it, but one thing about it, you can
[1:20:43] look back cuz you got a trophy case."
[1:20:45] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE
[1:20:48] TODAY." Come on.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I shouldn't have been here right now.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Praising God with joy in my heart. Come
[1:20:54] on.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Peace in my mind. I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
[1:20:56] HERE.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But when I THINK ABOUT WHAT
[1:20:59] GOD HAS DONE,
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT GIVES ME FAITH FOR EVERY
[1:21:04] MOUNTAIN, EVERY TRIAL.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; WHAT SHALL WE SAY THEN to these things?
[1:21:09] If God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:21:12] Hallelujah.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.

[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; I feel all right. Amen. That's just one
[1:21:20] thing about it. You know, God, that's
[1:21:22] what it is. You can be walking in the
[1:21:24] middle of a storm all around you, but
[1:21:26] just got peace.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Peace like a river. Come on. Everything
[1:21:31] can be falling apart all around you, and
[1:21:33] it's something about that inner peace.
[1:21:35] Hallelujah. Lord,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; you know, he he gives you that inner
[1:21:39] peace. You don't worry about that.
[1:21:40] People look at you all confused, but one
[1:21:43] thing you know, God's got it all in
[1:21:44] control. And when I get done, my
[1:21:47] testimony going to be greater than the
[1:21:48] trial that I've been through.
[1:21:50] Hallelujah. How many believe that
[1:21:51] tonight? Y'all feel all right? I feel
[1:21:54] all right tonight. Amen. God is good.
[1:21:56] Brother Pastor Palmer, you want to close
[1:21:59] us out in a word of prayer? Amen. God is
[1:22:01] good. Amen.
