that you would Minister to each and every heart touch and heal the sick save the lost confid the B whatever the needs are father God you know Lord you know how to help Lord you know how to deliver God so Lord you C set the captive free and heal the brokenhearted in Jesus Christ's name we thank you as we look to you to bless your word this morning in Jesus name amen Romans thirr chapter we thank God it was just so much coming as reading the message the unpardonable sin and U it was just so much in that you know it talks about Divine love uh perfect love amen so Romans 3 and 23 it says for all have sin sin and come short of the glory of God that you read the next and we read the last verse together redist whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sin that pass through the forany of God 26 to declare I say where is boasting then it is excluded by what law or work nay but by the law of Faith 8 28 therefore conclude that a man isied withouts of the is he the god of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also 30 is ccum together do we then make Lord the law through faith God forbid y we establish the law God bless you to read this word you may be seated God is good amen amen you know I I what is sin and um often times we see a lot of um different definitions of sin but we understand that when we think about Sin we think about the transgressions of God's law and um what is sin he says here in the 23rd verse for all have what s all have sin all have sinned and come short of the glory of God sometimes this scripture is often times used for an excuse for people to sin and so they said is Nobody's Perfect and all have sined and come short of the glory of God so sometimes people use it for an excuse that we can sin because all that sin and come short I told those young people don't get up when I'm preaching they do it every time all have sinned and come short of the glory of God are you with me what is sin sin is the transgression of God's law [Music] amen and we look at sin is the meaning transgression or overstepping the law it's U God has Divine boundaries between Good and Evil an iniquity is when we know what's right and we willfully do what's wrong are you with me so often times we look at sin and what sin is a lot of um let's look at Ezekiel again Ezekiel 18 Ezekiel 18 God is good amen sometimes we it's something about you know I I was sharing with the Sunday school this morning the one thing you want to do when you when you worship God you want to show God reverence you want to show God respect you want to show God that he's worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of Praise we want God to get Glory when we come to worship God we want our worship to be acceptable see because it's in man to worship God but whether or not we do it you know with our from the heart or whether we do it halfhazard and then when we worship God we must know what God is requiring and what God want because we can't give God anything just anything God this is what I'm going to give you that was the attitude in the beginning with Cain and AA well what is sin is transgression of God's law God said in the beginning he said in the beginning he says you can eat of every tree of the garden but of the tree of knowledge and good and evil that the day you eat thereof you're going to die don't touch it don't eat it or you're going to die that's simple you can eat everything else but don't do that when the sin began sin began in heaven when Lucifer said in is hard you know I will exalt my throne above the stars of God so he got exalted and lifted up in other words he said I'm taking over I'm taking over I'm not satisfied with what God made me and where God has made me and the position God has made me so I'm going to take over I'm going to set my throne and he convinced the third of the angels that hey if y when I get promoted I'm going to promote y'all I'm going to lift y'all up are you with me so we all going to be exalted amen and see sometimes people uh the pride get in the way he got lifted up in his heart are you with me so a lot of times when people get lifted up they expect for everybody amen look at how beautiful I am look at what God made me and I I supposed to be you know like God you understand so he saw in his until he was lifted up instead of being humble and thanking God for what he made us and how he made us people get lifted up and that's the attitude of man we were born with the sinful nature a nature that doesn't uh don't want to give God glory a nature that is corrupt it's a it's a sinful nature because of what Adam and Eve did it was passed down to everybody that was born of a woman now Jesus was not born by sex desire so Jesus was born the spirit over shad are you with me so he wasn't born a sinner are you with me so uh maybe I go hold you Ezekiel and go to uh Psalms 51 Psalms 51 Jesus was not born a sinner you know somebody say Jesus is born like everybody else I said no no no no I don't know who asked me that the other day I said no no I think uh gentleman asked me that I said no Jesus was not born in sin like all of us was born in sin but not Jesus are you with me Jesus was born of God are you with me Mary was not his mother as being she was an incubator she was like an incubator God used the body as to bring forth Jesus Christ but G it was not her egg neither was it Joseph's sperm are you with me but the spirit of God created egg and sperm and so if it wasn't her blood it wasn't his blood uh U Joseph blood but it was the blood of God Amen so what happens he was not born with a sinful nature he had a nature of God are you with me but the Bible says he was tempted in all like passion such as we he could feel pain he could feel sorrow he could feel rejection he could feel it all he wept that latter's grave he could feel sorrow he could feel everything he's God that's touched by the feeling of our what our infirmities he wanted to see what it's like and what you and I was going through being God he could not feel that but being a man he could feel what you go through he can understand like passions and and he can sympathize with you and understand what you feel he can understand disappointment he can understand rejection he can understand what it's like to be hated he can understand all of that being God he was a spirit but being the man he had to feel what you feel and understand but he could do it and not sin he could do it and not sin you know we can only take with so much and sometimes we get [Music] to we get to uh why is this happening to me or why did so and so do me like that why did they say that to me and we can start hurting and understand I ain't going to take that but Jesus took it he went through it for you and I the Bible says he didn't sin neither was God found in his mouth how many times we say huh they don't know who they messing with you messing with the wrong person when you mess with me because you don't know who I am Jesus knew who he was yet he humbled himself they asked him are you the are you the king of the Jews what say you of yourself you know Jesus statement knew who he was yet he let he allow them to do to him the things that they done but I wonder will we allow it will we allow ourselves to go through what he went through I said in Sunday school he was crucified in weakness but he rose in power are you with me he rose in power amen you and I like we are crucified every day we bearing our Mark our bodies the mark of the Lord Jesus Christ he we he he said I'm crucified with Christ Paul says nevertheless I live but yet it's not me that's living it's Christ that Liv in me are you with me amen and because because of his resurrection power we can die to ourselves daily amen are you with me because greater is he that's in you than he that is amen oh I meant to bring my Eclipse paper sister Anna I didn't bring it to the fo bit uh it was talking about in the message Shalom how the eclipse uh this the darkness covered the moon light the Moon is the type of the church are you with me and that was a total blackout of the Moon the prophet God said in this age there's a total blackout he said he permitted me to just to put a little light there but there's a total blackout and uh it says and gross Darkness should cover the Earth and darkness the people but he said arise Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord has arisen upon thee so he said I say to you Shalom are you with me so this eclipse is this he said I do signs in Heaven above and Earth beneath blood and fire and Vapors of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into the blood they talking about the blood and moon and the moon and the blood before the great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen it's time to call on it I said it's time to call on the Lord amen amen because we see the moon the blood moon turn it into blood and the sun Into Darkness in the midst of the day but we don't see the sign of the time we don't see what happened what's going on with Iran and Israel and what's going on over there we are on the verge of the third world war right at the tip of the iceberg right at it it could boom just like they sent those drones over the Israel my wife was saying that Putin says I have an Unstoppable bomb an Unstoppable bomb that in other words the United States can't stop this bomb and you remember the last Vision that the provate sou was America being po are you with me so brother and sister where are we will there be a tomorrow will there be a future for you and I I said we need to look up because our Redemption amen it it's time to look to God God oh Lord this world is getting more and more wickeder it's getting darker and darker amen so God Amen I want to I want to get out of this place amen you know I said you know some sometimes the a sister or brother going on Amen it's better to go on than to be around here when these bombs start to Falling it's better to say I'm going home so if the Lord come and get me say whoa don't don't try to bring me back here amen cuz it's getting ready to h i I believe something's it's going on it's this this this this place that we call Earth is getting ready to go through it's going through his birth pain but it's getting worse God bless you I got to go back y'all excuse me I got off but let me go back home sin David says here in Psalms 51 have mercy upon me oh Lord God according to thy what kind according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy tender Mercy blot out my what Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquities and cleans me from my for I acknowledge my what you know it's something about if you want the Holy Ghost I I just listen to God's servant and he said you want the Holy Ghost he said if you uh confess if you really confess and believe with all your heart and ask God to forgive you and to come into your life he said is then you bound to get the Holy Ghost if you do it right from the heart you can hold God to his word and say God Amen you promise I believe with all my heart amen amen now you say you believe with all your heart but if you really believe with all your heart that entitles you to the Holy Ghost if you accept Jesus Christ with all your heart and you said God I believe with all my heart Jesus that you died for my sin and I accept you as my savior then it entites you say Lord I now fill me with your spirit Lord amen fill me with the Holy Ghost how many believe Jesus died for your sin I believe but with all your heart with all your heart now and when you believe with all your heart you should say God I believe with all my heart everything within me I believe with all my heart then I should so Lord you promised me the Holy Ghost so I can hold God to his word amen and you know I I believe if you believe with all your heart that you can walk out of here this morning filled with the Holy Ghost amen but you got to believe with all your heart amen not believe with all your head and all your intelligence but with all your heart amen when you believe like that that means you surrender all to him that means that you saying God whatever your will is for my life I want it amen amen not my will but yours Lord I believe with all my heart amen amen Lord I give you my all am everything I got amen Lord i s all amen the reason why people don't receive the Holy Ghost like they used to it's because people don't want to give up it it ain't no new way of receiving the Holy Ghost it ain't no new it ain't that God don't want to give you the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is already here waiting on you to just receive it but it's up to you whether or not you want it or not because Jesus Christ is Savior and he's Lord okay I got to get David was acknowledging his transgression and his sin as ever before against thee and the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight David had done a wicked thing that thou may be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judge and then this is what I wanted to get to behold I was what and I was what see we was born a sinner did we have anything to do with it no we were born a sinner and we didn't have anything to do with how mean we are how bad we are we ain't had nothing to do with it but if you like it you born of sin but you like being who you are how you would Bor I can't help I was bone no you can't help it cuz you was born like that you was born to sinner but do you like it you look in the mirror I like it I'm this I'm that you know we ain't talking about looking in the mirror at your physical makeup but if your spiritual makeup what you are in the inside do you love who you are your character do you want to be like you are if you want it then you can keep it but if you willing to give it up for a better are you with me if you want to give it up for better then God got something better for you amen amen a better nature amen you know us Simmons are like this and us this is like that and yeah don't brag on that cuz us all us sin we all have sin and come short of the glory of God so it's not us this and us that all have sined we ain't got nothing to boast or brag about am we all came forth in sin shaping and iniquity nobody got nothing on the other don't care how smart you are how intelligent you are sin has it's judgment a punishment for being the sinner you will be punished huh I didn't do it I was just Bor this way why you going to make me pay for something I ain't had nothing to do with when you look at God he's unjust but here's here's the thing God is not going to let you pay for something you ain't done are you with me let's I Ezekiel let's just go back to Roman Romans 3 and 24 it says being justified freely by his grace through what see Redemption means that to be delivered by paying the price Redemption means being delivered by paying the price see you didn't have nothing to do with being born that way and you can't do nothing to get yourself out of that state but I want you to know that the price has been paid the pen the Bible tells us in Romans 6 and 23 for the wages of sin is is death but the God wants to give you a gift to take care of what the price that you could not pay He Paid a Debt he did not owe amen are you with me Christ Jesus Paid a Debt amen and I'm glad that he paid the price that you and I might not be trapped in a sinful body we might not have to go to hell and pay a price because of what somebody else done from Adam praise God in Adam the Bible says all died but in Christ all should be made alive are you with me so I'm saying to you that amen the debt has been paid amen amen praise God it's up to you to receive the gift amen of eternal life for God so loved the world am that he gave believe his only begotten son that whosoever believe in him do you believe you know I I I put down something sin is not believing somebody said I can't see that but seeing is not believing he told uh Thomas blessed is he that have not seen but yet yet they believe amen amen see we are justified by faith and we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore being justified by faith faith is not what you see it's what you believe amen and if faith is what you believe then the faith is the substance of things hope for and it's the evid see amen I don't have to see to believe it praise God I believe it though I've not seen it yet I believe amen are you with me and I receive the results amen because I am a believer am it entitles me amen amen oh hallelujah amen amen amen these signs shall follow them that believe Amen in my name they shall cast out Devils amen oh yes amen when you a Believer the devil is in trouble amen amen because God give you Victory and it gives you power amen amen sin should not have dominion over you anymore amen praise God you don't have to worry about Sin anymore you don't have to worry worry about that old sinful nature anymore God has handled it am he took away our sins and he gave us his righteousness amen praise God he been he was made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen thank God that I'm no longer a sinner amen amen praise God but he calls me a saint amen you you you you children of the God Amen praise God IJ you were once by Nature the children of Wrath amen but now amen no more amen I no more a child of Wrath amen come on somebody Shake somebody hand tell them the apple is not the tree the apple is not the tree but the apple is the fruit that comes from the tree but the apple is not the tree are you with me see the attributes of sin when folks said I I still drink I still smoke I I still fornicate I still commit a Doctrine I still do this amen those things are not sin as we see but there are attributes the Bible say you shall know them by their fruit so what kind of tree is an apple tree why because this isn't an apple a sinner is known by are you with me the life you live on the job in the school it doesn't matter what church you go to it does doesn't matter what you say you are it doesn't matter because your actions speak your life is the life you live is saying whether or not you a Believer or not come on somebody how you amen conduct your life how you look how you act how you conduct life tells me some folk you can just look at in the market place and you said that's a Christian that young man something about that young man something about that young lady she must be a Christian but some folk you look at them and the way they carry themselves you will never say Christian you never think Christian are you with me in their conversation you never think Christian because there's no Christ in their con conversation are you with me so we want Amen to understand what Sin is Sin is to reject God's word are you with me when you reject the word of God it's the door is open for sin when you misstep and you step over the boundary like Eve did she stepped over and she did what she knew she wasn't supposed to do because she dis believe what God Said Amen see we wouldn't have never had to feel pain never have to feel sorrow never have to be disappointed if Eve wouldn't have done what she done and Adam followed are you with me you would never have to have some of the problems and difficulties and the things you go through you would never have to go through do those things if you only eat of the tree of life and live forever are you with me somebody say well I see Christians they go through things are you with me praise God wouldn't you like somebody to be with you even in you amen amen see Jesus said I'll never leave you amen you know what happened happens amen he allowed them to go through the fire but he took the heat out of it are you with me the fire didn't burn them am come on somebody you go through situation you have different problems you go through like everybody else but what happens amen amen yes Lord though you walk through the valleys of the Shadows of death he said I'm with you and I'll never I'll never leave you are you with me I'm I I'm oh if he with me I'm all right amen praise God Amen because I know that no weapon form against me going to PR am amen amen I know I'm going to be all right am amen anyhow amen praise God hallelujah if you take this life I got another one amen praise God this ain't worth much anyway because it ain't oh Hallelujah it ain't worth a dollar now it sent this whole old body amen of Flesh amen but God got me one if this Earthly House of this Tabernacle where Des are praise God Amen I'm not going to pay attention to these things just a corruptible things when God has promised us incorruption amen when God has promised us eternal life why should I turn down eternal life for some Li of the devil amen I rather have eternal life than to listen to any the devil lies am we have Redemption praise God being being freely being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption of it that is in Christ Jesus amen I'm so glad he died for my sins and brothers and sisters I don't want to hold you a long time I'll start again on Tuesday but God bless you this morning I want you to know there's a savior that loves you that died for your sins that cares about you if you didn't hear anything else he loves you stick somebody hand and tell them God love me he loves you amen Jesus loved me this I know for what see
