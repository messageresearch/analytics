bless thy word now god in jesus name amen amen in your bibles tonight turn with me two places of scripture first we'll go to the book of [Music] saint mark saint mark the 16th chapter very familiar scripture reading but i want to try to take it from a different angle tonight saint mark 16 15-20 and then i want to go to the book of acts 1-8 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any daily thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he will receive up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following them one scripture there acts one and eight and we'll come back to um there one in eight acts one and eight said but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in your deer and in samaria and into the uttermost parts of the earth let us pray father we thank you god for the reading of your word god we pray dear god for your holy spirit tonight lord that you were quick quicken it lord and praise god for the right atmosphere god for your anointing lord i pray god that you bless o god the people in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen be seated i want to use for just for a few minutes tonight uh something that we were working with back in marion for a while and i want to entitle it god confirming his word god confirming his word and i know many of us have heard this read and we've heard many different sermons about god confirming his word and i know that many of us have preached it i know basically every preacher generally have preached it but i'm understanding that until that word be quickened we have letter now god when he gave us the word and he was dealing with his disciples teaching them when he was in his earthly ministry and he also even in one place gave them power to go to heal the sick cast out devils and what he was doing even after his demonstration of showing that uh he had something with him he had a power that he was demonstrating to the people on earth that now i just didn't come like any other preacher are trying to start a certain church but i'm actually showing you that god wants to confirm the word religion has betrayed people as a social ism of uh a gospel but yet the gospel has not really been demonstrated now to us we know about it and god gave a distinct vindication even in the serpent he said now before you go in the way he said now go to jerusalem and entirely there wait there because you're going to need something because he knew that the religious people of that day they could read the very same scripture they can read the very word just like it was writ but he said but go to jerusalem until i give you power and that word power actually authority because god got the power but he gave the church of that thing the authority to use you know what what good are you having something and you don't never use it and god as we know and heard thousands hundreds of years that this bible had been preached every nation has every country know about the gospel of jesus christ but very few people have the god confirming the word in other words that this gospel that we are talking about it got power to deliver it has power to transform you oh my it has power to to cause us to live differently it has power to change your very desire that you've been born with but you got to know where the power is at no church has it no certain preacher can give it to you but here in the book of acts he told them now um stay there until you be endued with power and i'm going to sin it jesus said i'm going to send the power how long you just wait and when it comes you will know that it's here and they believe the word they they followed what jesus had told them and as they waited in a paroon it never said how long it was but yet they had to believe what god had told them and the bible say now faith come by hearing and hearing of the word so they were there on what accord waiting for the promise of the father to me being manifest in them i wonder sometime have we received the power our church or you as a believer you are entitled to this same power but you must believe the word as god gave it to from there jesus and mark as he gave it to him that was saying they went see faith caused you to move because i say faith without works is dead and if god promised you sister or brother anything my god is able to do it if there's any a time that the church of the living god need the power of god it's right now there's never been a day never been an hour that we are seeing our christians living beneath their god-given privileges and you wonder why why are we so tossed and why are we so defeated like we don't know what to do it's because a liking of the power and sometimes the devil doesn't put this little betrayal on us and and keeping us down and putting us in fear that god won't do what he said but i want to tell you tonight it's time for us to move if we don't move now when we need deliverance spiritually and physically we need deliverance when we need it right now i can't wait to another servant i can't wait to a good sermon or a good prince lord i need the power right now why because the devil is flexing his powers political economically uh our every nation they're flexing their power they're making threats they're they're making this allegation that allegation church what about us i think it's time no i know it's time for us to really be about our father's business you know in the beginning of christ say lord i need it right now and i know that the state that uh the people are in or round our church folks the one that god gave this promise who gave the word y'all the problem ain't with the word we got the truth but the problem is get the truth to activate to get it to to come alive and i'm talking about not as a group but come alive in you in me because when you got something you know what you got and not boasting of anything but one day i remember peter those were going to prayer service oh my what a time for god to send the power and there was a man there by the church going to prayer you see what prayer service to do at that hour of prayer there was a man sit there begging for arms looking to receive something peter those that day if they were going to prayer i believe that was something that they did regular to go to prayer service no doubt peter them my inspiration saw that man and bible say the eyes fastened on him and they began to say look on us why because they saw a man that he needed he thought he needed arms or money and peter said no no no no silver gold have i none but such as i have i give unto thee he didn't say we give he said i give unto thee in the name of jesus rise up peter knew what he had and when you know what you got then you ought to use that it's not how much you know but do you know him do you know him his life oh my telling the truth i said listen we can't be sitting back looking for a good sermon to be preached to us we need god and we need them right now oh my i've been reading some things you as i look at the calvin and knox and all of those reformers and luther and wesley and you know even in that time they had signs and wonders god was confirming the word i looked up the word confirmed i i like i got real happy when i saw it i had an idea but it brought a better understanding to me and it said confirming means to to give new assurance of that of remove doubt oh my by authoritarian excuse me act are indisputed facts in other words god wants to move all the doubt about the gospel so god himself know not nobody but the god confirmed the word because if the world has been preached right and it's even believed right then god can confirm it like he said but there must be somebody that's going to catch it oh my intellectualism won't be able to produce this knowledge which is all right the gospel as people know it it's more than just telling people how good jesus is though that's good he is good but you really don't know how good he is until he confirm the word until god give us each one a personal experience with him that you can say i know my redeemer living i know that the god that i'm serving he is more than able to do what he said he'll do how do you know he did it with me see your very life ought to be a living testimony your living life your each one of us wherever you go you ought to be a lighthouse the way when people come in your presence they know something's with you devils tremble when you come the conversation has changed why because there's another presence there they're not able to sing and to do like they used to why because the power is there not to condemn but come to deliver that man that peter though prayed for after god raised them up see what would happen god been confirming the word they had then received the power they were in that upper room men and women and when that power come it shook that place they were in i don't know about these experiences that i'm hearing you know this quiet holy ghost i know it all about emotion but let me tell you something when the holy ghost came in the bible days they might have was quiet before it came but when it came bro i said they weren't like drunk man [Music] no no no no it wasn't quite anymore brother why because he came and when the power of god come or wherever jesus go there's a lot of noise and if you don't like the noise of jesus there's gonna be noise in another place too well when though people saw them striking like that room they said they drunk they thought they were in that upper room drinking wine oh no no but peter when he heard it he said no brother no we're not drunk and you support what did he do he pointed them back to joelle the very scripture identified this is that we ought to be able to point to the very scripture that have been spoken of us this is that oh my what are you doing what am i doing i'm letting god confirm the word come on somebody we're not we don't have a weak guard our god is powerful and he's not dead he's alive but then where is he at right here no more time to sit back what are we hiding back for everything else is out anybody's saying or nothing no more come on it's no time to sit back now come on let's show the world that you are one in a million what the people are looking for is a real powerful jesus never god just talked about or read about a sing about devil screaming amen oh yeah i was telling them trust me they're gonna be many they're gonna be looking on and wondering what you doing and you ain't even gonna answer them okay you know because we don't have time for that but you know you're moving into something you look at this word now then it came off the book come on the word this ain't on the book no more the bird out of word ought to be in you you become the manifestation of what god spoke of you in this hour oh yeah it's time to move not by your might but by the power of god that's what the church of the living god need the servant of god said something here that was so striking he said we are missing the power that's what's wrong with the churches he said they got truth but that you need to be enlightening it need to be quickened and only the holy spirit can quicken that word and when the word is quickened it'll cause you to act unseemly but act right according to what the scripture said of you this is our day they had a day in the bible he said the church of god that she will be the continuation of the book of acts we are to continue the commission he said the last commission that jesus said is to god preach the gospel and i'm gonna give you something i'm gonna i'll confirm your word because it's not your word and bible say they went forth look at that 20th verse mark 16 and 20. he said and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them see that's what you want be sure you get god first don't do nothing till he come go to the upper room parry there wait until power come and when the power will come then you go everywhere preaching the gospel and god here was working with them confirming what they spoke with signs and oneness or church where are the signs in the wonder that god has spoken of where is the power where is the god of elijah oh my is he here are we looking for it i want to declare to you he's here come on let's stop looking around stop looking to what has happened stop looking to what others may have done that's good for them but now how about us sisters you can lay hands on the sick if you got the power you know where you're at in the scripture god gives you authority you can cast devils out by the authority of the word be sure you got the power though don't do nothing he told him don't you go nowhere yet don't go out to all the world yet until oh that's why i believe the greatest cry in our churches ought to be let's have a prayer holy ghost night probably gonna say that's what we need he said we need to all night shut in and tell god something happened i mean not a thrill and not just a chill but we need a feeling but what he said that the church just got formal either got lukewarm the devil like a rampage making the people be belittled because of what's going on on the earth servant of god said here he said god hates a powerless religion he said it's got to have the power one plus he said if you have a religion ain't got no power he said you need to bury that and let me tell you something this is the hour you know what not now that everybody is making claims i'm the church i'm the church our church what we believe what our church what our path to say but let's go back to the scripture because that's where our identification is if you are that church of the living god then god ought to be working confirming the word with signs and oneness don't just say and i know we can say it because it's written in the bible that god is a healer until you see god heal until you know [Music] he's a healer we need the supernatural but to get the people minds in a condition and get it off of what's going on that's i believe it was the problem we've been distracted all this going on amongst us and what's going on in russia what's going on all this or that or death or that but the servants of god say normally in the darkest hours is when the supernatural take place oh when it gets so bad and everything seemed to be chaotic watch the supernatural then watch the church move in the power of jesus christ right in the midst of the world by to go crazy and people are giving up hope but they're going to be a people that's going to catch the vision and they're going to understand come on i don't have time for this i got to have the power of god working preachers you've got to have the power of god not just the intellectual of the message we need to see jesus that's what they told that man they said sir we would see jesus oh my what a uh uh a contradiction they want to hear but they wanted to see jesus how are you going to see jesus jesus was god manifested in the flesh and all that god was he poured it into jesus and all that jesus had he poured it into the church oh my what kind of people we ought to be he said the greatest curse he said fear he said they are scared they ain't not going to work church god word will work if that word can find a resting place in somebody's heart god will go to work but that word must fall on good ground no doubt no wavering i believe lord oh my no wonder he loved that song all things are possible only believe what kind of church we ought to be what kind of church is god looking for here he said here he said now if the church of the living god which is a pillar of truth god intended the church to be powerful church a glorious church a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of christ well well expected in his spouse and live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that god will be proud of this church to present it to christ at the coming of the lord you see what kind of church god looking for that's why you don't have time to be lukewarm come on sampson shake yourself some played around with delilah uh a long time a type of the world he played around with the world too long and and she had him script of the power she found out he told her his secret you tell the world your secret and the devil will script you of your power your prayer life is your power no prayer no power it's up to you and i i'm not gonna be like everybody else why because god called you each one of us god called you to manifest his word we're not a group but individually turning the cities upside down oh my lord but what are going to happen to howler we need to get back to prayer i mean crying out god we need the power right now our families our loved ones we see the condition we see the condition of the church we see the condition even around the message of the hour there's a a a lukewarmness there's a spirit of just giving the people some intellectual thing that what been said but where is the power come on either god is living or he's dead either we we're living in the our glare of what somebody else said and what i know that they say what he's saying i don't mind doing that but i want to see the manifestation of what he said but god never took his power he took his man but not in spirit even when in days of elijah and elisha elisha know that a lot it was going to go away and the people were trying to get don't you know your servant going to go he said i know it hold your peace what he was telling him come on i can't afford to be distracted i'm following something see when you know what you follow it it doesn't care what nobody else said you got a revelation i will not listen to what you have to say but i'm going to follow the pill on fire and elisha and father elijah went through different phrases and jordan in different places until elijah tried to even discourage him he said no i'm not turning around he said i know it might look like i'm following some man but no it's more than a man i'm following and when he got to the place he said but then what do you want he said i want a double potion of your spirit and a lot of he said you asked the hard thing he said nevertheless if you see me when i go it'll be granted an elixir was not going to leave he never came too far now church we didn't came too far where are you going to go now we don't see what god is able to do you have to keep your eyes when the pillow fire moved when the holy ghost move you need to move but there got to be a vision except people have a vision that people will perish and that's what the ministry is doing he he's trying to take us into another room he's trying to take our mind off chaotic and what's going on around you and let you know come on somebody greater is he that is in what in you who you every one of you oh of god said there's a hidden power lying in you i don't know about you but i don't know where the sentence i'm feeling it that you about to explode you just don't know what to do with it look like you can't go my soul you said bonnie but you got to release it and god wants you to let it loose because we've been holding back too long now this what god is doing oh no no brother it's gonna get greater than we ever saw church is time for us to move it's time for us to catch the vision come on you have a vision here and he's holding you somewhere not to just be a church score but to come into the presence of god and receive the power oh my then you have to worry about i got to wait i go to church no no no come on wherever you at you say the name of jesus you said silver and gold i have none but such as i got oh my i got the holy ghost you got the holy ghost don't wait till you come to church use the power oh my we're sitting looking wait what what else let me talk about i hear him talking he excited but what he talked about the power is here and god is is pouring out the spirit god you know i know we didn't have cooling off times but this is a time now fire come on how many of y'all when it was winter you sat by your heater and the thing wasn't even on [Music] you freeze to death i got fire turn it on then i don't know whether it'll work until you turn it on you'll never know let's turn the holy ghost on lord hear am i tonight i need the power lord i need the fire i need the power of god in my life i see it in a preacher but god how about me come on somebody you ought to get jealous and say i want that and the other time to get jealous that's where you ought to get just god i see it working in the middle so i see this but god how about me lord oh my lord help me oh jesus i will tell you we see in the power of god moving moving what is it doing he's trying to get the people to come up and let's move because what god wants to do with us we've been held back too long we've been sitting around gazing we got need to start if there's every if he said this he said you could ever get the church to come and pray and seek my face he said you'll be amazed what god can able to do but to get the people to understand run to the prayer service i know you're suppressed that's why you got to press your way through all that we got going on all that you got going on lord i got to make it i can't let nothing get in my way i don't know what the other thing i need to do but lord i got to put them on the back burner right now because this is more important yeah your job is important but this is more important than your necessary job i've got to see jesus i've got to have the power i've got to see the demonstration i got to have a move of god in my life oh church god bless you tonight [Applause] praise god amen god is good amen we thank god tonight amen after the holy ghost come upon you you shall have power amen we appreciate the word tonight you appreciate the word amen amen praise god i was reading the day and i was reading a fanny and finny was saying that uh what happens when the man houses on fire he said when the preaching of the word go forth and he was talking about how some folks respond when the preacher is letting the people know that they're going to hell and they're on the way to the lake of fire and other folks want to sugarcoat it he said not only what oftentimes we see people on their way to hell and nobody want to stop them it's just like you're seeing somebody running out in front of a car and you saw a child running out in front of a cough you had opportunity to save them did you let them go on and get hit you see somebody on their way to hell to the lake of fire and he said what if the house is on fire and you in it burning up somebody got to recognize your house is on fire you an opportunity to get that house that's on fire praise god it made me think praise god hallelujah the condition that people be in some time hey your house is on fire [Music] and you're going to be burnt up if you don't get out the house in time praise god that body that house that temple [Music] that you got the one that you got now born and since shaping the nicotine if you don't get out of that house because god he said in my father's house of many mansions god got a better place a better house for you to live in look around and see the life of folk folk living a miserable life but they think that that's the only kind of life i can live but god got a better life for you people don't know that there's a way out of it they don't trust god to believe god that god got something better for you i think all they can do is run around and fornicate adultery lying still and cheat drink and smoke and get high but god got a better life love they only do if they only knew the blessings that are in store for those that will trust and believe god that they only do [Music] god got so many blessings brother sister aren't you glad that god bless you one day to recognize it in your father's house in your father's kingdom amen there's uh so many blessings that i would have missed if i wouldn't listen and get out of that house that was on fire thank god that god made a way of escape from me brother and sister amen the children are annoyed thank god we saved brother yes sir amen there's a hell fire waiting on the other side get out of there god bless you tonight god is good and i'm saying thank god for the word we need the power each and every one of our lives it's sad to see people that don't want to change don't want a better life they have no in their in their mind in their vision they they only see amen what what the present this little world here that's perishing it that's falling apart that's all they see that's all they want you can't tell them that it's something better than that the devil got them so blind and so bound up i look around and i see these children i said what kind of hope and what kind of life that god got in store for him god got a better life but do they want it the devil have them so caught up in this present evil world till they don't even want what god got in
