[28:40] over your children everywhere father
[28:42] lord i pray god that you will meet the
[28:44] needs of those that are listening in and
[28:46] those that are here tonight lord god
[28:48] that you would speak to every need speak
[28:50] to every heart for certain of god you
[28:53] know our needs you know what oh where we
[28:55] stand and what we stand in need of i
[28:58] pray god that you're granted in jesus
[29:00] christ's name amen
[29:04] first samuel the eighth chapter
[29:13] first samuel eighth chapter as we stand
[29:17] we're gonna do seven verses i'll read
[29:19] the first you read the next
[29:21] and we'll read
[29:22] the seventh verse together
[29:25] and it came to pass
[29:27] when samuel was old that
[29:30] he made his sons judge or he made his
[29:33] son judges
[29:35] over israel too
[29:45] his sons and his sons walked not
[29:49] in his ways
[29:51] but turned aside after loot
[29:55] and
[29:55] took bribes and perverted judgment for
[30:07] and said unto him behold thou o
[30:11] and our sons walk not in
[30:14] thy ways
[30:16] now make us a king to judge us
[30:20] lack
[30:20] all the
[30:22] nations 6.
[30:32] together the lord said unto samuel
[30:35] hearken unto the voice of the people in
[30:38] all that they say unto thee for they
[30:41] have not rejected thee but they have
[30:44] rejected me that i should not reign over
[30:47] them may god bless you to work you may
[30:49] be seated
[30:51] tonight we want to
[30:53] talk to you concerning
[30:55] rejected king
[30:58] when the king is rejected amen
[31:01] now this could go from a lot of
[31:03] different angles and hopefully we just
[31:05] share a few
[31:06] different uh angers the king
[31:11] now if we notice mike
[31:13] in that seventh verse he says to samuel
[31:17] you know the lord said unto samuel
[31:20] hawking unto the voice of the people and
[31:24] and he said in what
[31:27] all that they say unto thee
[31:30] for they have not rejected thee
[31:33] you know a lot of times
[31:37] two wrongs don't make a right
[31:41] you know
[31:43] what samuel sons was doing
[31:47] was not right
[31:49] but what they were asking for and asking
[31:52] for a king that was not right
[31:55] so two wrong don't make a right
[31:59] because they saw the condition of
[32:02] samuel's sons and what they were doing
[32:04] and they pointed out
[32:06] you know their
[32:09] what they were doing to samuel
[32:12] and then so what they said well
[32:16] because this is happening this is what
[32:18] we want
[32:20] it's easy to see what's happening around
[32:22] you
[32:24] and you can see somebody doing something
[32:26] wrong you know people take the attitude
[32:29] or if they're doing it i could do it too
[32:32] you know and that's what folks do
[32:36] that gets discouraged
[32:37] because somebody else is doing wrong but
[32:40] remember you have an individual walk you
[32:43] must know god for yourself
[32:45] you just can't be following the crowd
[32:47] just say well i'm going to take things
[32:50] in my own hand
[32:52] you know what i'm saying
[32:53] i
[32:54] because you know we might we might find
[32:56] fault in this and fought in that but let
[32:59] us look at ourselves and
[33:00] whether or not let's see what god is
[33:02] saying to you as an individual
[33:05] see because
[33:06] you're going to be responsible for what
[33:08] god is saying now
[33:11] what they did they respected their king
[33:15] though they didn't have a king like the
[33:17] other nations
[33:19] mind you they did not have a king like
[33:21] the other nations all the other nations
[33:23] had a king
[33:24] but
[33:25] they had a prophet
[33:28] european
[33:30] and they had a king
[33:33] they had a king
[33:34] that ruled over them
[33:37] but they did not
[33:39] see that king
[33:41] in the physical realm
[33:43] neither do you and i in the physical
[33:45] realm see
[33:47] amen god
[33:49] but there's a god that rules over
[33:53] the church there's a king
[33:55] that rules over the church
[33:58] because remember
[34:00] he said the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[34:03] then if we're in the kingdom of god
[34:06] then we must have a king to rule
[34:09] are you with me
[34:11] as god served and said that you are
[34:14] the kingdom
[34:15] he is the king
[34:18] are you with me
[34:19] so you got to recognize that the king
[34:23] rules over the kingdom
[34:25] and you are the kingdom and he is the
[34:28] king
[34:31] are you with me
[34:32] so though
[34:35] i mean let's not you know sometimes look
[34:38] at the as they were doing they were
[34:40] looking at the physical
[34:42] kingdom
[34:44] of the world and they was looking out
[34:46] there and they saw all the nations had
[34:49] them
[34:49] a figure
[34:52] a visible head
[34:55] and it to them they must have admired it
[34:57] looked good
[35:00] i think we should have something of that
[35:02] magnitude
[35:04] so we want what the rest of the nations
[35:07] have now remember
[35:09] uh let's just go to first john here for
[35:11] a moment
[35:12] that we might rejected king
[35:16] he said they then samuel they didn't
[35:18] reject you
[35:19] but they rejected me
[35:22] oftentimes
[35:24] uh i i i hope
[35:27] before we get to that we will recognize
[35:30] that there is a king
[35:34] there is a king that's here
[35:37] he's invisible to
[35:39] most folks
[35:41] but to you and i he's real
[35:45] and we see him whom our soul love it
[35:49] amen and we have headship here
[35:53] praise god
[35:55] we have one that rules
[35:58] and have the authority
[36:00] over his kingdom
[36:03] are you with me
[36:05] and we must honor and respect the king
[36:09] to disrespect our king though he's
[36:12] invisible to
[36:14] the natural man
[36:16] but to the spiritual man he is here
[36:20] present
[36:22] for when two or three are gathered in my
[36:24] name i'm here
[36:28] he promised to be in our midst
[36:32] praise god and he's watching over his
[36:34] kingdom
[36:35] his eyes go to and fro through the earth
[36:39] all things are naked and open before the
[36:42] eyes of him and whom we have to do
[36:45] are you with me
[36:46] the king is here
[36:49] let's honor the king
[36:51] now
[36:53] this kingdom was not as
[36:55] egypt it was not as uh babylon it was
[36:59] not like the other kingdoms of the world
[37:02] but this kingdom that god special people
[37:05] when he called an exodus out of egypt he
[37:09] met and
[37:10] he said you are a peculiar people
[37:14] amen
[37:15] you are a holy nation
[37:18] amen so i i made you special you're not
[37:21] like the rest
[37:23] i call you out
[37:26] the church today
[37:28] is called the call out
[37:31] so we've come on an exodus
[37:34] not out of
[37:37] egypt the natural
[37:39] but we have come out on a spiritual
[37:42] exodus out of mystery babylon the great
[37:45] and coming out of mystery of babylon
[37:48] god took us to a place
[37:51] not a natural land but into christ
[37:54] himself
[37:56] are you with me
[37:58] so you and i have journeyed it
[38:01] okay
[38:02] let
[38:03] let me just go here uh first john 2
[38:06] and 15.
[38:08] god calls us not only out of the
[38:11] spiritual
[38:15] see
[38:15] there are nations that we came out of we
[38:18] came out of
[38:20] denomination
[38:22] are you with me
[38:23] they came out
[38:25] of egypt they came out of natural
[38:28] nations physical countries they came out
[38:31] of that
[38:33] are you with me
[38:35] we've come out of the different
[38:37] denominations of the world we god called
[38:39] us on a spiritual exodus to come out of
[38:42] them
[38:43] and revelation 18 said come out of her
[38:46] my people
[38:48] and we heard the voice that cried
[38:51] to the people of god
[38:53] with the spiritual echo that echoed to
[38:56] those that god
[38:59] amen and it sounds
[39:01] like the voice of god calling his sheep
[39:04] out
[39:06] are you with me
[39:07] so we just didn't come to uh
[39:11] to a mountain that about sinai but we
[39:15] come
[39:16] to mount zion
[39:19] we come to a kingdom that cannot be
[39:21] moved
[39:22] we come to the church of the living god
[39:25] the church of the firstborn
[39:28] amen the pill and ground of the truth
[39:32] amen that's what we come to
[39:34] on a spiritual
[39:35] so we have a king that's leading us
[39:39] we have a king that's leading us out
[39:42] praise god
[39:44] i hope
[39:46] excuse me i said first john 2.
[39:50] yeah
[39:52] it says here
[39:54] love not the world
[39:56] we know that satan is the prince in the
[39:59] power of the air
[40:01] and satan is their king
[40:03] apollyon
[40:06] cake satan is their king
[40:09] the king
[40:10] that rules this world he said to jesus
[40:13] all this how will i give you show them
[40:15] all the kingdoms of the world say all
[40:17] this what i give you if you bow down and
[40:19] worship me
[40:21] are you look man
[40:23] see
[40:24] and you know what
[40:26] satan will give you the squirrel and his
[40:28] goods
[40:29] but
[40:30] are you with me
[40:32] but he wants
[40:33] worship
[40:35] are you with me
[40:36] see people worshiping
[40:39] in an invisible devil
[40:43] they're they're worshiping
[40:45] demons and devils without
[40:48] consciously physically knowing that they
[40:50] are also or have a king
[40:54] and his name is satan lucifer or
[40:57] whatever
[40:59] are you with me
[41:01] so these kingdoms these kings are at
[41:04] war the flesh walls against the spirit
[41:07] and the spirit against the flesh
[41:10] are you with me
[41:12] praise god and remember i said
[41:15] you are the kingdom
[41:17] and
[41:18] the devil is trying to overthrow
[41:21] your the kingdom isn't that right
[41:24] remember he said the kingdom of heaven
[41:25] is not meat and drink but righteousness
[41:27] peace and joy in the what
[41:30] in the holy ghost are you with me so the
[41:32] devil would like the thief cometh not
[41:35] but to kill the steal and what
[41:38] destroyed amen but he said i come that
[41:40] you might have what
[41:42] let you might have life and that you
[41:44] might have it
[41:45] more abundantly amen so god amen you're
[41:49] in a kingdom that cannot be moved
[41:52] the joy you have the world didn't give
[41:55] it in the world
[41:57] are you with me
[41:58] so
[41:59] oh brother
[42:03] says
[42:05] listen he says love not the world
[42:08] neither the things that are in the world
[42:10] the things that are in the world they're
[42:13] temporal
[42:14] they're only going to last for a little
[42:16] season
[42:18] but the things that are not seen they
[42:20] are
[42:21] eternal
[42:23] are you with me
[42:24] so you by faith see the unseen
[42:28] as moses saw him who is invisible
[42:33] amen that's why he forsook egypt because
[42:35] he saw the invisible god
[42:39] how can he see the invisible god by
[42:41] faith
[42:42] amen amen
[42:45] praise god
[42:46] faith is the substance of things hoped
[42:48] for the evidence of things not seen
[42:51] but yet by faith we see
[42:54] for we walk by faith
[42:56] not by sight
[42:58] are you with me
[43:00] so we're on a journey of spiritual
[43:02] exodus
[43:04] praise god in this third exodus amen
[43:08] we're going somewhere
[43:11] amen we're entering into that realm of
[43:13] that cycle of a wretched faith
[43:17] are you looking
[43:19] the world don't know that we're moving
[43:23] praise god
[43:24] we're moving at such a high speed
[43:27] praise god
[43:29] hallelujah one day that light that amen
[43:32] they might call it a ufo whatever
[43:35] praise god one day that light came in
[43:38] praise god
[43:40] we'll just drop down and pick you up
[43:43] praise god you'll be changed in the
[43:44] moment of the tweaking of an eye
[43:47] praise god hallelujah
[43:49] oh amen i thank god for the sisters she
[43:51] said to my i hear my thief in the call
[43:53] calling me
[43:54] come up a little higher
[43:57] until god pay love
[43:59] amen i hear it calling me come on up
[44:03] come up here
[44:05] praise god because he after the church
[44:07] ages was over he he said come on up here
[44:11] amen god calling you to a higher place
[44:17] oh god
[44:19] i just got started and want to stop
[44:23] say here we are he says
[44:26] love not the world neither the things
[44:28] that are
[44:29] in the world if any man what
[44:32] love the world
[44:34] the love of the father is what
[44:39] you know no matter how beautiful things
[44:41] look now
[44:42] god says don't love it
[44:45] you only
[44:48] your love is for god
[44:51] i love god
[44:53] amen
[44:55] god is love
[44:57] amen
[44:58] you must fall in love with god
[45:01] and you i mean
[45:03] your love must be single
[45:06] not to another amen
[45:09] the love of god amen i love god i'm in
[45:11] love with god
[45:12] so if i'm in love with god i don't love
[45:15] this world
[45:17] praise god there's many things in the
[45:18] world you can fall in love with
[45:21] that you wouldn't want to give up or
[45:23] lose
[45:24] amen but when you got god you got
[45:26] everything you need
[45:28] everything you need when you got the
[45:31] lord when you have the lord
[45:33] are you with me
[45:35] praise god so he says
[45:37] these are the things that are in the
[45:38] world
[45:40] now
[45:44] if any man love the world the love of
[45:46] the father is not in him
[45:49] praise god
[45:51] you wonder why people do certain things
[45:54] because they love the world
[45:57] and if they do
[46:00] the love of god the father not in him
[46:04] simply
[46:05] you cannot love
[46:08] you cannot serve two masters
[46:12] you hate the one and love the other
[46:15] so if you're in love with the world
[46:19] you it's
[46:20] you become an enemy of god
[46:23] are you with me
[46:25] enmity with god
[46:27] okay
[46:30] he says the love of the father is not in
[46:32] him now you might say
[46:35] what are you talking about
[46:37] so he breaks it down he says for all
[46:39] that is in the world is what
[46:42] the lust of the flesh
[46:46] you know sometimes
[46:48] we get in trouble because
[46:50] we spend all of our attention and all of
[46:52] our money
[46:55] you're never satisfied
[46:59] sometimes you know
[47:02] i got to get a new outfit every time i
[47:04] get a paycheck
[47:05] i got to get a
[47:07] better call better house better this
[47:09] better that better
[47:10] the devil will run you crazy
[47:13] if you follow him up
[47:15] you can't even that flesh will never get
[47:17] satisfied
[47:19] you know so he says
[47:22] all that's in the world is the lust of
[47:25] the flesh
[47:26] this flesh cry out
[47:29] talking about it has needs yeah it has
[47:31] needed need of god
[47:34] come on
[47:36] but my god shall supply what
[47:39] according to his what
[47:42] so what god has for you is greater
[47:45] riches
[47:47] than that which is in egypt that's that
[47:50] then that
[47:51] that's in the world
[47:53] and
[47:54] moses recognized that god had greater
[47:56] riches
[47:57] than it would
[47:59] than those that were in egypt are you
[48:01] with me
[48:02] so brother and sister you got to
[48:04] recognize god got greater
[48:06] he got more for you he got more to offer
[48:09] you
[48:11] the devil might have certain things he
[48:12] can offer you but you got to recognize
[48:15] it's going to last just a little while
[48:18] temporary pledging
[48:20] it's only for a season
[48:22] well what god offers you is eternal
[48:27] okay
[48:28] it says for all that is in the world
[48:30] lust of the flesh
[48:32] and the lust of the what
[48:35] ah it's what we see we want
[48:38] did you see it yeah i see i'm gonna get
[48:40] me one of those get one of these one of
[48:42] those one of these oh lord sometimes we
[48:44] have to settle down
[48:47] settle down just settle ourselves down
[48:49] and say god
[48:51] just what
[48:52] just leave me guide me
[48:54] sometimes we have to not only are we
[48:56] fasting for the tent and praying for the
[48:58] tent meeting but we need to fast from
[49:01] stuff
[49:02] just stuff
[49:04] just fast i i'm not gonna do this
[49:09] no more you know just let me fast from
[49:12] that because i don't want nothing to be
[49:14] my god
[49:16] you know what i'm saying
[49:18] and so i have to kill you know the bible
[49:20] said we die daily
[49:22] so some things you have to crucify
[49:25] something you got to make sure that that
[49:27] thing is not ruling over you
[49:29] that's not your king
[49:32] doesn't that's not what you're
[49:33] worshiping
[49:35] are you with me
[49:37] see because if you put anything before
[49:39] god
[49:40] amen then that's
[49:42] that becomes your king
[49:44] and he rules over you are you with me
[49:47] so you don't
[49:48] want anything in this world to rule over
[49:51] you amen you have one king and that's
[49:54] king jesus
[49:55] are you with me
[49:57] and he rules in his kingdom
[49:59] amen
[50:01] my life is not my own
[50:04] he says
[50:06] and the pride of this life
[50:08] is not of the father but of the world
[50:12] the world passed away
[50:14] and the lust thereof
[50:16] but he that does the will of
[50:19] what
[50:21] hollow
[50:22] abided how long
[50:24] see that's what
[50:26] you got to uh
[50:29] be set with inside of your spirit and in
[50:32] your heart and in your mind that i'm
[50:34] going to be settled i'm going to be set
[50:38] praise god my eyes got to be single
[50:41] i got to know amen
[50:44] whom i believe and i got to be persuaded
[50:47] that he's able to keep that which i've
[50:49] committed unto him
[50:51] against that day
[50:53] you got to be fully persuaded
[50:55] that god amen
[50:57] oh lord
[50:59] oh he rules
[51:02] praise god you can tell who's ruling
[51:04] amen
[51:05] yo yo the very manifestation of your
[51:08] acts and how you uh uh conduct your
[51:11] lives shows who
[51:12] [Music]
[51:14] who rules
[51:16] amen
[51:18] so
[51:19] i'm i'm gonna have to cut it short
[51:21] because
[51:23] i might
[51:24] make it a series but let me just do this
[51:28] go to uh
[51:29] maybe you
[51:31] i don't know how i'm gonna do it
[51:33] i want to talk about the marriage of the
[51:35] lamb a little bit
[51:36] and and talking about the marriage of
[51:38] the lamb
[51:39] revelation um 10th chapter 19th chapter
[51:45] maybe i'll finish
[51:46] sunday morning but
[51:48] let me just try to get you
[51:51] some highlights here
[51:53] the marriage of the lamb
[51:57] and it says
[51:58] his wife has made her separating
[52:02] are you with me
[52:05] the marriage of the lamb
[52:07] it's very important to recognize
[52:10] when we talk about the king
[52:13] and we talk about the one that has ruled
[52:16] headship amen you know when he's when
[52:19] that
[52:20] sin happened in the garden he said to
[52:22] eve your desire shall be to your husband
[52:25] he shall what
[52:27] rule rule over you
[52:29] so we talking about the marriage of the
[52:32] lamb and the bible said his wife has
[52:34] made herself
[52:37] ready isn't that right
[52:39] so
[52:40] the husband should be the head
[52:44] and
[52:45] over the wife isn't that right
[52:48] so
[52:49] eve
[52:50] headship
[52:52] was adam are you with me
[52:55] but we've spiritualized everything
[52:59] and we've took taken
[53:02] the bible and made it with none effect
[53:04] so we got all kind of stuff going on in
[53:06] the church just today
[53:09] because we we
[53:11] we've taken and perverted the gospel and
[53:14] twisted it all up till there's no
[53:16] hatship no more
[53:21] instead of
[53:24] the parents
[53:26] being headship over the children the
[53:28] children got more rights than the
[53:30] parents
[53:31] everything is turned upside down
[53:34] are you with me
[53:36] so
[53:37] if we're living in a world that made
[53:40] almost the bible obsolete maybe it don't
[53:44] don't mean nothing
[53:46] because they folks go to church
[53:48] and they disregard the bible
[53:52] they made the bible of none effect
[53:56] there they crucified him
[53:59] where
[54:01] there
[54:03] jerusalem
[54:04] most holy city
[54:06] there where in the church
[54:10] amen he came into his own in his own way
[54:14] his own people amen
[54:16] so right in the midst there they
[54:19] who
[54:20] his own people
[54:22] they
[54:24] there they
[54:27] the the one that they
[54:29] said
[54:30] he's not our king crucified
[54:32] they rejected the king
[54:35] they said he he won't rule over us
[54:38] in other words you're not going to tell
[54:39] me what to do
[54:41] i'm going to tell you he's still king
[54:43] and i'm going to tell you
[54:45] he he's still here right here
[54:48] christ is revealed in his own word
[54:51] are you with me
[54:52] he's still king
[54:54] pray
[54:55] i'll tell you
[54:57] i i did a track when i was a young
[54:59] preacher about 40 years ago
[55:02] and i said you buy now about leader
[55:05] are you with me
[55:07] i said i'd rather bow every knee should
[55:09] bow and every tongue is going to confess
[55:11] to jesus christ is lord
[55:13] are you with me
[55:14] we can either do it now later but
[55:17] every knee shall bow
[55:19] amen
[55:21] so revelation
[55:24] uh 1919 only reason i'm going here
[55:27] because i i want to deal with the
[55:29] rejected king
[55:30] and i and i want you to see
[55:32] um you and i have a relationship with
[55:36] we we have received our king
[55:40] amen
[55:42] and
[55:43] in that in that we receive the king
[55:46] it identifies us as his kingdom
[55:49] and as we have received the king we know
[55:52] who he is we recognize him
[55:55] there they didn't recognize who he was
[55:58] so they rejected him
[56:00] and they didn't want him to rule over
[56:02] them because amen they were already
[56:05] preoccupied
[56:08] they were already saying i'm a pharisees
[56:11] if you're going to come and rule are you
[56:13] going to come and tell us what to do
[56:15] then you got to go to school and be like
[56:18] uh a chaotis and
[56:20] and go through like uh saul of tasha's
[56:23] paul you got to go identify yourself
[56:26] because you don't have an authority
[56:28] except you got letters
[56:31] from the high priest
[56:33] are you a pen
[56:35] and and you see they they they they have
[56:38] gone and they've structured themselves
[56:40] so today and jesus
[56:43] even in this age he talks about on the
[56:46] outside of the church he's been rejected
[56:47] in the church and then lay out a seal
[56:50] the bible says he was knocking on the
[56:51] door what he was knocking on the door to
[56:53] church that means he's on the outside
[56:56] amen
[56:58] you know sometimes
[57:00] if jesus wanted to walk in and say
[57:03] something he had to wait on protocol
[57:07] the spirit just couldn't move
[57:10] are you with me
[57:11] because they got it so structured that
[57:14] they they're almost organizing and got
[57:16] it so structured to jesus had been
[57:21] he's out of the picture
[57:22] are you with me
[57:24] so uh
[57:26] so uh the people of god
[57:29] you will be out of the picture you're
[57:31] not you're oddballs you you
[57:35] he's despised and rejected the men a man
[57:38] of sorrow acquainted with greed and we
[57:40] hid as it were our faces
[57:43] oh you look man
[57:44] so if the
[57:46] if they did it in the green tree he said
[57:48] they'll do it also in the dry if they
[57:50] did it to jesus they're going to do it
[57:52] the same thing to you
[57:54] are you with me now if they don't do it
[57:57] to you then something is wrong with you
[58:00] amen but we want to be accepted
[58:04] we want to be like the rest of the
[58:07] nations you know
[58:09] are you with me
[58:11] so we we are looking at them and we
[58:13] almost you know
[58:15] we are mine them
[58:18] amen
[58:20] but the one we ought to have our eyes
[58:22] focus on
[58:24] is the king
[58:26] but how can you see the king
[58:28] when he's disguised
[58:31] he's hidden in his own word
[58:35] amen but yet he comes amen for he says
[58:38] search the scriptures for in them you
[58:40] think you have eternal life for they are
[58:43] there to testify of me
[58:45] praise god amen now they were looking
[58:49] for him the messiah
[58:51] but the woman at the well recognized who
[58:53] he was
[58:55] he
[58:56] i know when the messiah come she might
[58:59] have had five husbands the one that she
[59:01] was living with wasn't her but she
[59:03] recognized because she amen was amen
[59:08] the the one that amen
[59:11] oh
[59:12] i'll show you
[59:13] the bride
[59:15] the lamb's wife
[59:16] amen
[59:18] are you with me
[59:20] it comes down to
[59:22] identification you can see what others
[59:26] don't see with all their uh spirituality
[59:30] with all their uh knowledge and all his
[59:32] schooling yet they cannot see god reveal
[59:36] in his own word
[59:38] coming according to what the scripture
[59:40] said here come
[59:42] just oh
[59:44] oh hallelujah
[59:47] they were so intent
[59:50] on getting rid of john and when jesus
[59:53] come they were even more intent
[59:56] amen
[59:57] so jesus said which other prophets did
[59:59] not your father's kill
[1:00:02] amen so how are you going to receive
[1:00:04] jesus they always did that
[1:00:08] brother and sister throughout all when
[1:00:10] it comes down to the word the word was
[1:00:13] always looked at as being something out
[1:00:15] of date
[1:00:17] are you with me
[1:00:19] uh something that's not for us
[1:00:21] it's something that was or something
[1:00:23] that's gonna be but never recognized
[1:00:26] when it's identified now
[1:00:29] when it becomes present tense they can't
[1:00:33] they talk about a god that wants in a
[1:00:35] god that is to be but the god that is
[1:00:39] jesus said go tell them that i am sent
[1:00:42] you
[1:00:44] and he said before abraham i mean
[1:00:47] was
[1:00:49] i am
[1:00:50] i believe that he is right now
[1:00:53] the same i am is in the midst the same
[1:00:56] one
[1:00:58] are you with me
[1:00:59] but we amen as they did not recognize
[1:01:02] him neither they meant the world today
[1:01:05] recognize that he is living and he's
[1:01:08] real right now amen and on this he's
[1:01:12] still here
[1:01:14] he's still the king
[1:01:16] and he's still rules
[1:01:18] amen not by force
[1:01:21] but whosoever
[1:01:22] will ain't that praise god when we can
[1:01:25] yield ourselves
[1:01:27] and when we can get ourselves out to
[1:01:29] wait
[1:01:30] when we can say lord i love you
[1:01:33] not my will but let your will be done
[1:01:36] praise god lord
[1:01:38] oh hallelujah
[1:01:41] that's what we got to release
[1:01:44] and let our faith be anchored in the
[1:01:47] word
[1:01:50] okay so
[1:01:52] it says
[1:01:56] let us uh uh 19 7.
