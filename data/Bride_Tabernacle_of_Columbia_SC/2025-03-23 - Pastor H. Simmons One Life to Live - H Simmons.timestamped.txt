[37:43] Now often times
[37:45] we we would like to rewind the
[37:49] tape and play it all over again
[37:53] because we'll see things
[37:58] that we saw when we were teenagers and
[38:02] we we get 30 we see things a little
[38:06] different amen so we want to
[38:09] rewind the choices I made at 13 and
[38:16] 14 at 30 I wouldn't make those
[38:20] choices things that I
[38:23] did at
[38:25] 30 and 45
[38:28] brother J I I I I I probably would
[38:30] change
[38:31] it some of the things and some of the
[38:35] decisions I
[38:39] made and
[38:40] at
[38:43] 60 the things that I did at
[38:47] 45 I probably would rewind the
[38:51] tape and I do a little things different
[38:57] at
[38:59] 45 when I get
[39:04] 60 brother FR I can't go as far as you
[39:06] can
[39:08] go but when I got
[39:11] 70 I do a little
[39:14] different than the things I did at
[39:18] 60 something about
[39:21] life I only got one time to live
[39:25] it I only got one life to
[39:28] live but I'm always learning
[39:32] amen I'm always gaining uh wisdom and
[39:37] knowledge always see the need of doing
[39:40] things
[39:43] better are doing things are
[39:47] different because somehow some
[39:51] folk they
[39:52] [Applause]
[39:55] live the life they live at 16 they still
[39:59] trying to live it at
[40:03] 60 that
[40:06] person has not
[40:08] learned
[40:11] anything are you with
[40:14] me and I challenge some folks at
[40:18] 90 they still trying to be
[40:22] 20 are you with
[40:24] me they haven't learned much
[40:27] amen but blessed is the person that will
[40:31] gain wisdom with gry

[40:41] their
[40:41] [Music]
[40:43] mistakes in life you might struggle and
[40:47] make
[40:49] mistakes and you gain knowledge and you
[40:52] gain wisdom from the mistakes you made
[40:58] many times I said if I had a chance to

[43:24] see sometime we we go through it so in
[43:28] in such a
[43:30] hurry we want to do things so
[43:34] hastily sometimes the person you married
[43:37] you probably
[43:40] wouldn't you married them at 25 and you
[43:44] wish you at 50 you realize
[43:50] hey I wouldn't have doubt it if I had
[43:52] the sense I got at

[45:07] eyesight and sometime you just get
[45:09] caught up in the
[45:11] moment and we make hasty
[45:16] decisions well if You' have just
[45:19] waited and got a little
[45:21] wisdom and sometimes at 20 you don't
