trust in the lord thank god again for everyone let us stand as we read the word this morning we're going to matthew 15 chapter 21st verse until the 28th verse i'll read the first you read the next we'll read the 28th together as we bow for a moment father we thank you for lord god your word today thank you for the songs we thank you for the worship lord we ask you to be with brother gordon as he travels by lord and be with your saints lord and each and every one that's on the prayer listener brother kenneth hargrove then lord uh brother carl likes us to pray for the doctor mrs burgess lord sister burgess and her her children lord and husband lord pray god that you touch her lord this morning meet her needs lord and touch a children's life father lord we just pray to god that you'll move today let the holy ghost have preeminence meet every need lord lord every sickness every affliction lord god you are more than able to heal in the liver saved and set free by the power of the holy ghost in the name of jesus christ we thank you amen as we read the word stand for the reading of 15 matthew 15 21 through 28 then then jesus went dense and departed into the course of tarry inside him 22. but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cried after thee 24. then came then came she and worshiped him saying lord help me 26. and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs would fall from the master's table together then jesus answered and said in him o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee and made whole melody god bless you you'll be god is good amen we want to talk this morning about being persistent or perseverance and perseverance means to uh be persistent and making a goal you're persistent i was i praying this morning and i said and in my prayer i was going a different way for this morning but as i was praying this morning and it was dealing with giving up too easy we give up too easy we want something from god but it seems as though sometimes we uh if it don't happen quick enough or fast enough we tend to say it's not the will of god but we tend to make excuses but this woman had a need with her daughter and she wasn't going to give up easy and i'm saying once you hear from god and you know it's god you know so many people give up on their salvation when things get a little uh tough and the tasks get a little hard things just ain't going so smooth in life some folks give up easy amen they come in shouting and dancing and praising the lord but letting life struggles come people are so quick to give up on god praise god it's only because i don't think they're certain uh are they sure amen we must be certain of god we must be sure that we heard from god see once you've heard and you know you heard from god it's not easily amen that you're going to give up so easy oh brother and sister if you want something from god you know you can't get it nowhere else but god if you want it bad enough you're not going to give up easy oftentimes we want god they meant to do something for us but we give up they meant too easy we don't try hard enough you know everything life comes with the price and some folks amen because they don't want to pay the price for what they want sometimes it's it's a certain job a certain uh you set a goal and you want to be amen perhaps a doctor lawyer maybe you want to be a teacher or or something that you set out a goal in your mind this is what i want to achieve there'll be a lot of obstacles and things in your way but if you set out on that goal you must be persistent amen it's just how bad do you want it are you certain that's what you want but i find we're living in a world where people are uncertain they have no goal young people seem sometimes to have nothing that they want to try to achieve in life they have no goal and amen and so they just uh you know they'll do anything because they are not looking forward to nothing they're not trying to achieve anything but when they set out that i have a goal in sports amen there's a price for lebron james and amen tiger woods and different people they set out amen their parents set them on a certain pathway and sometimes the culture set them on a certain pathway and amen and sometimes in our lives your mother or father grandmom or somebody that sets you on a certain pathway now you might deviate from that pathway but sometimes amen amen and maybe with uh serena and venus or whatever amen that died amen he he had a vision in mind and he set him on that pathway amen and it's something about them going along with their parents vision and they were able to enjoy the trip you know it's an enjoyable trip if you amen are sudden you come on one accord with the journey but the journey becomes difficult when you don't want to do amen the pathway to the parent sexual and grandmama and granddad and amen mama and dad set you on a pathway but you don't want that in your life you know it's something about the god of abraham and the god of eyes and in the god of jacob amen god said abraham i know you tell your children and your children children so i'm going to bless you because i know you're going to tell them the right thing you want to lead them in the right direction so abraham i'ma bless your seed and your seeds are going to be at the sand of the seashore amen praise god i'm going to bless you amen because i know you'll keep my word i know i i i can trust you i can put my confidence in you brother and sister how about god don't god you know god knows us amen he knows every mistake you might have made in life and every mistake you may you're going to make in life but yet god looks beyond that amen he sees a pathway amen is whether or not you see what god sees in you it was on one occasion amen god called the man of god you great man of battle and he was he didn't see that in himself and sometimes until we can see the vision for ourselves we're not able to achieve or not able to positionally placing and where we're going forgetting and said if god be with us then we'll be all his miracles which our fathers told us about amen sometimes we seem to be least of all we don't seem to know they meant that that i'm a great man of valor that amen god can deliver the million nights say man god's going to use me me me amen and sometimes we can't see what god sees in us amen but if god said it amen you can believe that god can do it whatever he says [Applause] he'll do it for you praise god you know i was looking this morning that look let's just look at genesis 6. but by the grace of god you look at certain things in life and i believe we're at the junction of time where this world has come to his end i believe that all the signs of the times are telling us we're at the end and if we're at the end amen then there's got to be some people that are positioning place to go into god's ark amen but we must understand amen if we're at the end and amen the days that we are not living in are the days locked until the antelope of your world amen we must understand that if we're at that time lock into the flood amen then we must know amen the things that happening at that particular time but the bible says jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever if he's the same god then god you know somebody says history got a way of repeating itself are you with me what god did in shadow form in the old testament he did it in reality form in the new testament are you with me so there are things that are materializing and happening all around us praise god but yet we can't see amen we don't understand what's going on you know sometimes we don't want to know we're so busy we try to cover up amen when god amen is warning us and trying to tell us and get our attention sometimes we say no this just happened coincidentally amen sometimes we push god to us to the side amen no god trying to speak to us in every way we don't want to hear him why because look here uh genesis 6 and 13 i believe it is it says here it says and god said and to know the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is full of what violence how many of you believe that the earth is full of what how many you know colombia is full of violence every time we look around somebody's shooting or killing somebody think about the other little lady who just got killed i think it was 90 something years old and they somebody went and killed her amen so here here we are the earth is full of violence violence in the school somebody might come on this job and shoot up people i was just praying for a young man he was at work and he was just in the heart unit and uh i prayed for him this morning and somebody came to the job site and started just shooting that rambling nobody knows why he he's been on life support several times and but god's mercy and grace is still with him he just had just as in the heart unit and now he told me this morning i'm going home now in a little bit amen so uh he here here we are where people the violence is everywhere can't go to school without violence you can't go to work without violence everywhere you go is violence everywhere well that's how i was in the days of noah and the thought violence through through them and behold i will what i will destroy them with the what i think god is looking down now and seeing that i remember elderly brother in mullins he's just saying he he said your time my time time is winding up destruction's in the land and god's going to move his hand your time my time that was brother grover smith amen your time my time time is winding up and he had one of those old-timey voices it was very coarse and and he said your time he wasn't let me go hit him your time my time time is winding up it says make thee an ark a golf award room and so forth and then he told him um it was a time to build an ark because god knew the oncoming storm was coming so i'm gonna get you to do something for me no and you know what happens when god just looks down and he chooses a certain folk you know this is an individual walk i mean this is not a family thing amen just because god uh and though god uses families it's not a family thing it's an individual thing as mama said to me son i'ma pray for you that god would open your eyes amen because as a teenager you know you seem to be blind amen the way i dressed the way i wanted to style and file and look mama said you look crazy boy you look like somebody that lost their mind i said you know when i walk outside and walk down the street and the car's beeping and blowing and i'm i'm really somebody and the girls ah i said yeah yeah yeah i'm i look good you know mama said you look like a fool but you know i was so blind i thought i was the coolest thing you know what i'm saying the the clothes that i wear and the way i dress and everybody hollering and screaming and go to school every you know i thought i was something you couldn't tell me a thing my head was so big amen it was blowed all the way up are you with me but i you know one day i was after i i i came started coming to the lord i'm standing on the counter in greenville south carolina i'm just freshly coming to the lord and i'm so cool i'm looking like charleston blue got my hat on and got my what what you call those high shoes high up in there what they call it they platform and everything i just got saved you know i ain't sanctified yet you know i got saved and guys come up to me and says i want to buy some doogee in other words i want to buy some dope and i said you know you know i can't talk you know in other words i ain't got nothing man they say man you we know you got it i mean they want to fight me you know because they know i if you gonna look like that and you don't have no what you mean you ain't got nothing you know what i'm saying you know it's certain things are attract you're supposed to have what you look like if you ain't got what you look like folk won't get upset with you because you're supposed to be don't appetize it if you ain't praise god no using appetizer you know so what what happened to me when they were talking to me i heard a voice and the voice said to me take off your shoes the ground you standing on is holy ground i say you know it just about blew me off the corner tears came to my eyes i know that nobody knew i said i ain't i i i won't tell nobody this because i started having experience at the experience i say i'm not telling anybody this no no no no because people are going to say the lord calling you to preach son and i said i'm not going to do that not me never ever i'm not going to preach and folks have already told me god called you and i said he ain't he not me i'm not doing that you know and i said i'll never stand up in front of people because i wouldn't even do it in school so here it is i went home all of my styles and files i mean hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of clothes i got rid of them my sister and her husband is the bishop with the pastor she said you don't have to do this outside you don't have to give away you don't have to get rid of all your stuff at that time i wasn't going to tell her nothing because i didn't want nobody to know that something was happening down you know these are things you keep hear away secret because folks are trying to push you where you don't want to go and i'm not going to tell them then they tell a strange thing they called columbia tell my mama you know the boy you know something happening to this boy you know and everybody trying to talk to me but i kept these things in my heart because i'm not going to tell people i ain't just coming to church you know a lot of folk just come to church you know i i you know i i'm in church because when i'm i'm ready to play professional football and stuff like that and i think i'm going somewhere that way then all of a sudden somebody's stopping me and something going on with me are you with me so when god began to move in your life and things begin to change and you can't explain that to nobody you don't try to explain it when god is speaking to you as an individual amen you don't try to tell people what god they don't believe god's gonna talk to you they don't believe what's going on in your life is that god is doing these things so i knew nothing and then if you tell them god doing that people might look at you a little strange i remember my sister brundo she was you know mama used to pray for her all the time and every time you saw her she wouldn't dare come in mama house with a beer but she had a little cup sipping out like she got some water and she's sipping out the little cup every time you see it you got to look up and she's drinking beer or something and mama you should you know talk to him about the lord sometimes i said mama just let him go she said i can't help it i gotta tell them about the law i got to tell them they need to come on sir the lord anyway the fourth day one morning mama had died and four day one morning brother got up and she's and she was crying and weeping and she was she was shacking up and everything she said the lord saved me the lord saved me and she was old boy she know she's going to wake up the whole neighborhood the lord doesn't save her she had a cadillac and she told a fella hey you have the car you have everything i i got to get out of this life you know when god speaks to you amen it doesn't matter where you're at when god speaks to you things change it doesn't matter how many times you come to church amen but it's somewhere along the line you got to know when god is talking and when you come to grips with that god was talking to me all the time but i was hardheaded and i wasn't listening and then and you know when god keeps speaking amen he make it a little bit more rocketer you just go on amen you you coming if you you might come lame and crazy but you come and have god and you belong to god you're gonna come don't worry about the thing you might not come the way you want to come but you comment if you belong to god and you know i had that decision i i i felt like god told me you know it's all right you go down that road but this is what's going to happen to you if you go down that road and and sometimes you almost can look at people pathway as a minister you you've seen it so many times you can look at decisions folks are making amen and they think they can just get out of it so easy amen when i get ready i'm gonna serve the law huh i've had so many that come and say you know i remember i was baptized in most of the city of mullins especially the young people sometimes 10 and 12 a week on the block cleaning the block drug dealers everything you know and then uh one sister she would tell her sister got baptized his neighbor the street got baptized and i got the young people coming she was tough she said i'm not going to be like the rest of them she said when i come i'm coming all the way and i said one day she stepped in and when she came she came all the way for 30 days and maybe 60. see i'm telling you something those that just struggling but they they want to go they have some struggles they have some battles they have some ups and they have some down but bit they're determined but those just say well you know i i i'm riding i made up my mind sometimes those don't last too quick those that just come easy and quiet amen don't we have those that came like my sister brenda wide open stirred up but she had seen the supernatural she started seeing visions she started seeing things and amen she thought talking to people and telling people what god said and this and that all of a sudden jesus broke into the supernatural and so by the grace of god what happens to you when god wants you to break into the supernatural if you can only you know that little small steel voice try to guide you in the right direction amen those little things that happen in life that god began to speak to you what if you just take heed to that voice what if you just keep on pushing it this side and thinking that things are going to get better things are going to get right when i get ready when i finish what i want to do no no doubt noah probably had a lot of things in his mind but he heard the voice of god they told him what to do to build ark i believe nowadays the people try to build their own ark of salvation they got their own way i i'ma do it my way my own art that gonna save me are you with me salvation is of the lord it's nothing that you can do it's what he's done for us isn't that right they're gonna build their own ark but noah was persistent you know it's something that you got a revelation god spoke to you and he speak to all the big bishops and apostles and oh television evangelists and all the great preacher people of the world amen the most scientific and educated world they meant even nowadays they can't make a pyramid like they did they don't have to die in the different colors that they had amen they don't even know how to do it that scientific age was more intelligent than this age but yet noah had a message that blew their mind he said god said it's gonna rain it never rained and all the scientific instruments proved to the world that it would never rain but noah said it's gonna rain something that they never experienced but noah had a message amen same as though this man was ridiculous why are you saying certain things you know when it comes down to you as an individual and your salvation it seemed ridiculous to your friends it seems crazy to the rest of the world but when you're certain that god spoke to you somebody my friend said hen what's the motto you think i could explain to them what what's going on with me so i know not to say man i you know the best thing for me to do is just be cool and just go on and go to church and try to get an anchor before you try to save somebody else makes your use good and sad and that's why people get a lot of trouble they go out and try to save everybody else and they just getting saved themselves sometimes you got to anchor and be certain of god and get your faith anchored and get solid and established in the faith people make so many mistakes amen you're trying to get them in and you halfway in yourself that's what happens so we got to realize that we got to get our anchors and so i realized i want to include myself and you know i i realize i still i'm still working i'm a work in progress so god's still moving in my life and i i still got things that god is dealing with me i don't know whether i've totally got the victory yet praise god so i need more things amen amen to i need to die to some more things in my life you know this is a journey but amen the journey is just ain't complete when you when you get saved amen you got to get sanctified and when you get sanctified you got to get the holy ghost and when you get the holy ghost you got to live it praise god so the journey amen god takes you on that journey as an individual this is an individual thing and you can't explain that to everybody you can't talk to everybody about that and then even some folks been sitting around 20 30 years in the church and they joined the church and they they think the church save them or the bishops save them or whatever amen they they don't have the experience that you have so when you talk about it they get jealous of you when you say god was dealing with me they talking about god dealing with them like they somebody special you are special god knew you were special yeah he dealt with you amen because you were worthy you are special to him so people well i've been going to church 34 to 50 years and here come this little boy talking about god i remember one of those times i'm telling my testimony and i said god people look at me you know 80 and 90 years i'm 70 years old god talking to them you know but there was others that say god bless you young brother you know god spoke to you amen and they followed they encouraged me they set me down they told me about the witches and the witchcraft and all that kind of stuff you know and i said oh lord i didn't know i was gonna come in contact with all that stuff but you know if you save long enough the devil ain't gonna come at you in every kind of way he can come at you amen and the devil can't get you he's gonna come against your family he gonna come against your wife he's gonna come against your children the devil is after you are you with me praise god so you got to make sure amen that you understand amen that you're on your way to heaven but you got to fight every inch of the way that's why paul said i fight the good fight of faith that i might lay hold on eternal life it's a fighting time brother and sister praise god you got to fight the hole on the gods unchanging hands you got to say god amen

me and when god placed you in the word you ought to stay in the word are you with me god places people in the word and they won't they don't want it they don't appreciate it you don't appreciate what you got amen you know sometimes we don't appreciate the god that's so merciful to us it's so good to us we don't appreciate the god that loves us so much that he saves us and we don't really take you fully advantage of the salvation that god has given to us sometimes we let the salvation slip sometimes we don't appreciate all the goodness of god i was i i was looking at my wife this morning and uh she had already cooked and all of that and then um i had my shirt laying there i was going to get ready to hide it and the next thing i know she didn't iron his shirt and i said you know i said you know she cooked she ironed her clothes she do this i said do i really appreciate it enough i thought about that thing you know sometimes we you know i said sometimes we god things are happening around us and we uh you know we we're taking things for granted we we don't appreciate what's really going on so lord let me i i i came in the room before i left and i said thank you you know what i'm saying because i i realize at that moment maybe i'm not appreciative enough you know you know you got somebody that you don't you don't demand to do she ain't she don't have to do it but she want to do it she's not under the law amen that you're going to do this she's going to do that she did it because she wanted to do it i said how many wives that you on your own clothes yeah they defect your old food you know how how many how many times you have to deal with that you know what i'm saying but when when somebody want to do it and willing to do it and you say well you don't know what you got and that same way with god sometimes we don't know the kind of god we have praise god you don't know amen how good god is to us amen when you wake up in the morning you ought to say thank you jesus amen when you were able to have half the strength and the covet pass you by and folks are laying up in the hospital and then on respirators and dying all around you and god has his hand oh oh lord we don't appreciate god god is good to us keep your children keep your family god is good keep you happy god is good to us praise god how many times we say thank you lord thank you lord don't take it for granted thank you lord lord i appreciate it let us stand i got to cut it off y'all i'm trying i was trying to get started but god is good amen i'ma tell you something if you don't hear nothing else you've got to be persistent that woman jesus said did not meat to give the children bread to the dogs you know somebody call you a dog are you with me uh and not she said it shows you about the right attitude when you want something from god are you willing to you know maybe she said well thank you i thought you were the man of god i thought you was just uh thank you for talking to me like that i'll see you later you know i'm not a jew i'm just maybe a greek whatever and you know you don't want to you know you don't want to do nothing for my daughter you you you because she because she's not a jew i'm only sent to the lost sheep of the house of israel she said but she said lord i got a need and i know you can help them you see what i'm saying once you know god can help you and you have a need in your life you know how you dealing with your situation how you trying to fix it how you're trying to make your life better are you what are you doing that you might be happy and that you might have joy and peace in your life what are you what what what kind of medicine what kind of ark are you building what what what what are you formulating what are you getting together and is it working is the medicine you taking working it's whatever art you build whatever you're formulating in your mind is it working for you i guarantee you it's not working i guarantee you when you think you got it all figured out amen you still gonna have problems and the same thing that you're searching for you'll never find it there the only place you can find that kind of peace and that kind of joy jesus said the joy that i give the peace that i give the world cannot give it to you are you with me so the world can't give you this kind of peace the world can't give you this kind of joy so no use in you trying to the brothers and sisters once you find the pearl of great price sell everything you have and purchase the field i found that pearl of great price i found that which my heart longed for i'm so glad that i didn't just found he found me he saw something in me that he he knew that i needed him he knew that i wanted to be a child of god i wanted to please him i wanted to serve him brother and sister if you're not satisfied with this world jesus is it as our we bow our heads certainly lord some people are persistent but they're going in the wrong direction because what they achieved those things in this life it would not satisfy the soul but he said you said he that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled you told a woman at the well you drink this water you'll never thirst again father i believe that same water is available that thirst that every soul has but they try to drink the wrong kind of water drugs and alcohol and immoral living and all of that but none of that would satisfy the soul none of that would quench the thirst for the soul but brother sister friend will you allow jesus to come in because surely he's the answer to your heart's cry as our heads of my heart are looking to him is that someone that says i need to be more persistent i give up too easy pray for me brother simmons thank you thank you i want to be more persistent i give
