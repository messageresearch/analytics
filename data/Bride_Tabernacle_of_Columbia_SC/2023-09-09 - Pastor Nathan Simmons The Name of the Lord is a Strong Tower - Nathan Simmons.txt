God we're looking for the power of the Holy Ghost bless these that come tonight let something be said Lord to cause us to want to serve you cause us to want to pray Lord we needed people or we need your help tonight Lord we look to the hills now for which comes our help I help come from you bless the past of this church Lord bless the members here in Jesus name amen amen not much of a Preacher but I thank God for his grace and mercy on my life amen they're turning the book of Genesee everybody know Genesis to see book amen but we pray God will open up his understanding teaching if one of us Genesis level chapter the first verse in the whole earth was one language and of one speech you may be seated and it came to pass at the journey from the East that they found a plane in the land of Shawna and they drailed there perhaps some of you know my uh Kelly you're my reading started the third verse amen and we want to talk about amen a safe place the name of the Lord is a strong tower the right should run in there in their what we'll see we don't brother and they said one to another go to let us make break and earn them thoroughly and they have brick for stone and slime had they from water yeah and they said go to let us build us a city in a town let us build us a city and a tower who's taught me reaching to Heaven I think that's what happened in this last days everybody want to build a Mercedes and everybody want to build on my tower is that's right every Church want to build their own Tower you know and let us make a name unless we be scattered let us make a name amen people want a name for themselves you know and be unless we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth and the Lord came down to see the city in the tower which the children of men build it see me as a building this Tower not God we don't and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do amen we don't go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called Babel Babel because the Lord did it there confound the language of all the Earth and from thence did the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all the Earth that's good let's go to Proverbs 18 chapter in the 10th verse amen and we see here nimrod desire to build a towel to reach under heaven and God came down and confound the language read on Proverbs 18 and 10. the name of the Lord is a strong tower the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous runeth in to it innocence we're talking about building a tower tonight I remember as a Young Man I live on Schoolhouse Road I want to buy the whole I went about a whole Schoolhouse Road not just on my house on Schoolhouse Road my motive injector was about a whole community make a name Bill Miller Tower when you're young you have a lot of ambitious I was young I was motivated not only I want to do that I want to take over the Paper Company the whole thing I wasn't satisfied just being an independent carrier I want everybody I want the management I want the secretary I want the whole thing so I started hiring people I know the white man has the most commonness in me he said someone whoever they called me for their house somebody said someone should I have I said yeah my motor injected when I was young it's a build me a towel like nimrod but God come down and he confounded a language as it is today many of you want to have Ambitions nothing wrong with it as long as your motor interjected is right each individual sitting here want to build up my home if they're young they want a good job they want to build something for theirself and for their family for their children they want to build them a tower like Nimrod some kind of top preacher the pastor church men are want to build a a towel in a name for themselves not for God that's nimrod build him a job but about the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous not anybody the right should run in there and they'll see some people uh don't know me you know of me I got to reveal myself to you and let you know what what kind of mind I hate my mind was not like an ordinary kid I thank God she one of my old friend to come up with low fear the Lord I call them brother some correct me the Lord she called me pancake ain't nothing wrong with that years ago loafer working for me on the paper route I'm going way back and I hope I ain't said nothing to defend her she was one of my first paper girls I had a young kid 14 years old I had grown I had people working for me I'm making three and four hundred dollars a week that's a lot of money for that day but what I'm saying here I have my own thing I was doing many of you want to build something but you want to do it without God never I want to build it but they want to do it on his way I want to build it my way and maybe you are here tonight want to build you something yeah I could probably could have been rich possibility but I've chosen to leave Columbia South Carolina to go to Mother South Carolina did I find out what life was about there I learned to depend not on me or what I could do I learned something that I want to learn in Colombia I learned how to be Pope I learned how to not behave it's helped me the greatest lesson it build character in there because you can go out here and you can build a great name for yourself and you could do it in vain young people when I was 11 years old like some of these young boys and 11 years old I was already Dynamite I already was a hustler I didn't wait till I got 15. maybe I was the only one in my family was like that I don't know but I want to tell you tonight if you don't put God first you'll be your own child like never wrong you don't know what it means to go out here and want to be somebody the Bible said a poor oppressed to pull it like sweeping rain trying to get up there louder trying to be something Society many of you come to church but you may have the wrong reason why you're here you may have your own objective what you want to be some of y'all might want to be Beyonce some of y'all young girls you'll never make it you'll never be a Browner some of y'all might want to be Jay-Z you'll never make it once God put that Christian thought in your mind as a child once God put you maybe said here but it's something that God can put in you you can't get rid of and he planted the sea in the club I couldn't get rid of it I done a pool table or whatever I did I could not erase Christ out of my life he was deadly state you can build your own Tower you can do your own thing but if you want to get hold of Christ tonight we was in the world we used to hear a song Jerry Butler used to say you'll help young man messing up the minds of a lot of pretty girls but brother you got to face one fact all the hardest you give out it will come back you're a pretty young girl that's not the mind of a lot of young men but girl you got to face one fact oh the honey you give out you're gonna get them back and the Bible just pray that I just here be not deceived God is Not mob whatever you sow you will read coming to Christ me and my brother at the Electric Warehouse he ain't not here tonight one of me and my brother and I was at the left let the warehouse when God called me I was not in church I had no intention of being Church I was intend to party I had no intention to give my life to God no intention I'm headed to California me kid and we and Nathan and Roger I'm going to make me some money honey that's why I was headed for money money money not a little bit of money much as I can so I heard their words again the whole world and lose your soul you could build your own Tower many of you here do not even have a revelation what I'm talking about I want to be so because when you is nobody your whole objective in life is I'm a Visa and I'm gonna I'm not gonna do it the right way I'm gonna do it my way you're never wrong God came down Nimrod was a mighty Hunter storm like Donald Trump yeah y'all know familiar with Donald Trump you might not be familiar with Hitler and Mussolini and a lot of other great leaders of the era but y'all coming for me with Donald Trump he'd do it his way unaware bizarre way if you don't get the mind of Christ you're gonna do it your way unfortunately every black man will live to be for 25 years old the average when I was in the street the average black girl would not survive she would not survive I did in the street y'all young Christian young men you won't survive you're not against them you don't know what a gangsta is until your best friend is a hit man you don't know what a gangster is to somebody offer you to sell all the drugs and make your
