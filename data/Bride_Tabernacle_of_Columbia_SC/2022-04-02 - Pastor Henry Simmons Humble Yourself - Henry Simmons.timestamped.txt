[35:51] philippians 2.
[35:55] just a little something i shared now in
[35:57] the marlins last night and
[35:59] hoping that it'd be a blessing for y'all
[36:01] tonight amen
[36:07] it says
[36:08] if there'll be
[36:10] therefore any consolation in christ
[36:12] if any conflict of love with any
[36:14] fellowship of the spirit
[36:17] if any vows
[36:19] and mercy
[36:20] fulfill ye my joy that ye
[36:22] be like mine that having the same love
[36:25] being the one accord of one mind
[36:28] let nothing be done through strife or
[36:30] vain glory
[36:31] but in the loneliness of mind let each
[36:35] what
[36:37] let each esteem what
[36:42] let's read that again
[36:45] in loneliness of mine let what
[36:53] look like every man on his own thing
[36:56] but every man also on the things of
[36:59] others
[37:00] let what
[37:05] amen god bless the reason towards you
[37:07] may be seated i want you to think about
[37:10] it let this mind be in you
[37:12] that was also in christ jesus we're
[37:13] still dealing with
[37:15] for the last few weeks
[37:17] is humbly humble
[37:19] yourselves
[37:20] humble yourselves
[37:22] amen
[37:24] so it's very important that we
[37:27] humble ourselves and
[37:30] and i said
[37:31] every time i minister just about the
[37:33] lesson it's room for improvement in me
[37:36] and i trust that we'll see room for
[37:38] improvement in each and every one of our
[37:41] lives that we can be more humble
[37:44] amen
[37:45] and god will give us more grace to be
[37:47] more humble amen
[37:49] so we're living in in a day that
[37:52] we're looking for god will be looking
[37:54] for rapture material
[37:56] and looking for a people that are ready
[37:58] for rapture
[38:00] and if we're a raptured material
[38:04] then it takes
[38:06] people that's going to be humble
[38:09] for god resistance to proud but he gives
[38:11] grace to the humble
[38:13] amen
[38:15] and to be humble is is very important
[38:18] that
[38:19] we arm ourselves with humility
[38:23] because without
[38:26] uh
[38:27] if we don't harm ourselves with humility
[38:29] then pride was going to take over our
[38:31] lives
[38:33] are you with me
[38:34] so it's very important
[38:37] um
[38:38] it's something i want to find and just
[38:41] keep on coming to my spirit so i got to
[38:43] try to find it
[38:47] let me try to find it amen god is good
[38:50] somebody get your read from me brother
[38:52] ernie to somebody
[38:54] okay
[38:58] let this mind be in you
[39:01] which was also in christ jesus
[39:04] you got that philippians 2 next verse
[39:12] but made of himself of no reputation and
[39:15] took upon him the form of a servant and
[39:18] was made in the likeness of men
[39:21] and being found in fashion as a man he
[39:24] humbled himself
[39:25] and became obedient
[39:28] the bible says
[39:30] he thought it not robbery you know i
[39:33] when as i was looking at the lesson
[39:35] and even today i looked at look who god
[39:38] is
[39:40] and maybe i was talking to renee or
[39:42] somebody i'd say look who god is how
[39:45] great he is god almighty the creator of
[39:48] heaven and earth
[39:50] the bible said he thought it not robert
[39:52] eureka with god but the bible said
[39:54] that he was god in the beginning was the
[39:58] word the words with god and the word was
[40:00] god
[40:01] he said without controversy great is the
[40:03] mystery of god and his god was
[40:04] manifested in the flesh he was a god
[40:07] with all that great power you know as
[40:10] jesus when he tried to take him he said
[40:12] he had power to call 12 legion of the
[40:14] angels
[40:15] you didn't need 12 leads you know he
[40:17] needed was one
[40:19] are you with me
[40:21] but
[40:22] all that power he had but look what he
[40:24] did he humbled himself
[40:29] you give give
[40:32] lord have mercy
[40:33] i'll be scared
[40:36] if you give some folk a little bit of
[40:39] power
[40:40] lord have mercy look what they do with
[40:42] the little that they think they have now
[40:47] so i must examine myself
[40:50] am i you know
[40:53] how do i get god's power to be
[40:55] manifested in my life you know as we
[40:58] read about
[40:59] you know as the prophet god was talking
[41:01] about
[41:03] the real power he says conquer yourself
[41:07] and submit yourself to christ
[41:09] to humble yourself before him that's
[41:12] really power
[41:14] are you with me
[41:17] you know you got to resist yourself
[41:19] conquer yourself
[41:21] if you want the real power of god
[41:23] amen but people you know they look you
[41:27] know
[41:28] unless we see room for for improvement
[41:32] unless we really uh examine ourselves
[41:35] and look at ourselves
[41:37] we really
[41:39] say lord
[41:41] i i i'm a failure
[41:45] i fail all the
[41:46] time and i need you i need your grace
[41:50] and mercy to help me
[41:52] help me to humble myself
[41:56] i didn't ask him
[41:57] to humble me i asked him to help me
[42:00] amen that i might humble myself
[42:04] are you with me
[42:06] but you know most people amen don't want
[42:09] help
[42:10] because they're already humble
[42:13] there's no room for improvement
[42:16] you know
[42:17] but
[42:18] as
[42:19] as i look at
[42:20] jesus
[42:22] who thought that not robbery to be equal
[42:24] with god who was god
[42:26] and
[42:27] the power who he was
[42:30] and who he is
[42:32] and yet
[42:35] he he he humbled himself
[42:39] to what
[42:40] helping himself pick it back up we go
[42:47] see
[42:48] when you humble
[42:50] you're obedient
[42:52] are you with me
[42:55] when you're humble you're obedient
[42:58] when you find folks that
[42:59] won't be obedient when you find a child
[43:02] that's not obedient you don't find a
[43:04] humble child
[43:06] are you with me
[43:08] you cannot
[43:10] if a child is not obedient
[43:13] that child is not humble
[43:15] are you with me
[43:17] you don't have a problem
[43:19] with the humble child
[43:23] your problems come in with a rebellious
[43:26] child
[43:28] he told saul
[43:29] saul
[43:30] he said who is thy lord
[43:32] he said he said i'm jesus
[43:35] it is hard for deed to what
[43:37] kick against the priest
[43:39] paul what had too much pride in him his
[43:42] own ability
[43:44] and his authority and who he was
[43:47] he had self-confidence
[43:50] but god had to
[43:51] the light had to shine he fell to the
[43:53] earth and he realized that that light
[43:56] that that one that caused him to fall to
[43:59] the ground that was god
[44:02] and he said who are you lord the lord
[44:03] said i'm jesus
[44:05] you know sometimes
[44:07] we think that as individuals sometimes
[44:10] we think that it's one another that
[44:11] we'll persecute i i'm saying take for
[44:15] example
[44:16] you know god he was showing me in these
[44:19] lessons he said you know a lot of times
[44:22] you know if you're not if you stay
[44:24] humble because sometimes you can be
[44:26] kicking against debris
[44:28] you know and you know
[44:30] it's not i'm not talking about you
[44:33] i'm talking about what i'm learning
[44:34] through these lessons
[44:36] that i have to be humble
[44:39] amen
[44:40] and then god can show us something
[44:43] god will show us what he wants us to see
[44:47] and what he wants us to know if we're
[44:49] humble
[44:51] amen
[44:54] it's a it's another thing that i'm
[45:00] i want read but
[45:03] a little bit
[45:04] i need another reader
[45:06] we got that two readers
[45:08] okay
[45:10] caleb you must read too
[45:13] y'all ain't got no money you don't have
[45:14] a mic
[45:15] you gotta have one
[45:18] how they gonna hear you on the air
[45:21] y'all here but
[45:23] you're also talking to another audience
[45:27] okay
[45:29] you're talking to two audience
[45:32] and when y'all hear clear i don't know
[45:34] whether they hear
[45:36] and
[45:37] not because i want
[45:39] god knows god knows that too
[45:42] i'm not gonna try to explain
[45:44] he said
[45:45] okay
[45:46] the prophet god says show me a church
[45:49] that's humble
[45:51] real humble
[45:53] not an arrogant church
[45:56] you know
[45:59] and some of y'all know you got children
[46:00] that you got to explain to them what you
[46:03] you you tell them something
[46:05] and they giving you word for word and
[46:08] back
[46:09] you know it's something wrong
[46:12] you know that child gonna have a
[46:13] troubled life
[46:15] that child gonna suffer some stuff
[46:18] if you you said something to him
[46:22] you know
[46:23] back in the old days
[46:25] you get slapped down
[46:26] quick right
[46:29] you may not be humble but you should
[46:32] you know you're not going to
[46:34] get word for word
[46:37] and and because
[46:40] a lack of humility and see
[46:44] when we don't have respect
[46:48] for those that are in authority
[46:50] then we'll never humble ourselves
[46:54] you know when you come before the church
[46:56] you say oh judge genre because you know
[46:59] he's got authority
[47:01] you got to respect his office
[47:04] are you with me
[47:06] and as parents
[47:08] children should respect their parents
[47:10] office
[47:14] if they're in the lord
[47:16] are you with me and trying to tell you
[47:18] the right things
[47:20] are you with me
[47:22] then you need to humble yourself because
[47:24] if you don't you're headed for a lot of
[47:26] trouble
[47:28] are you with me
[47:30] and when troubles start coming your way
[47:33] lord have mercy you don't want it
[47:36] are you so it takes humility you need
[47:40] to uh
[47:42] know that
[47:44] if i be humble you know
[47:46] my mom used to say you never get too
[47:48] whole i'm still your mama
[47:51] you know what my brother's or someone
[47:53] acting up and she might get the broom
[47:55] boom
[47:57] you're never too old
[47:59] are you with me
[48:01] or whatever she can find and she gonna
[48:04] you know you're gonna get straight now
[48:07] you're not gonna
[48:08] disrespect mama at no time
[48:12] are you with me
[48:14] and you're not gonna disrespect daddy in
[48:16] no time
[48:17] so those are the things that we got to
[48:19] learn how to conduct our lives
[48:22] in humility humility amen is respecting
[48:26] one another
[48:28] are you with me
[48:30] now anytime you have to demand respect
[48:34] then you're in trouble
[48:38] when you demand respect
[48:40] then a christian attitude i'm not
[48:44] god don't demand you to obey him he
[48:47] wants you to understand who he is
[48:51] and how much he
[48:52] loves you and all that he's done for you
[48:55] see because your parents they take care
[48:57] of you they took care of you when you
[48:58] couldn't take care of yourself
[49:01] you see what i'm saying to disrespect
[49:03] them is to say i don't care what you did
[49:06] for me
[49:08] are you with me
[49:10] you always give them respect
[49:12] are you with me
[49:15] now
[49:16] if you can give your natural parents
[49:19] then you also
[49:21] have those that watch over you
[49:24] as spiritual leaders
[49:26] then
[49:27] you have to respect them even if you
[49:29] don't want to
[49:31] and if you were to disrespect them you
[49:33] disrespected the word
[49:37] he said obey them that have rule over
[49:39] you for they what
[49:42] watch for your soul you say well nobody
[49:44] watching for my soul
[49:46] but they do
[49:48] and that's why it's a very serious thing
[49:51] i i was telling one group that i was
[49:53] working with i says
[49:56] i have to get to know y'all
[49:59] because i got to give a count for y'all
[50:02] if i stand in this position
[50:05] i have to give account to god
[50:07] so if i don't know
[50:09] and something like somebody have to die
[50:11] and pass away and i'm up there saying oh
[50:14] they'd have made it all you made the way
[50:16] about
[50:17] i don't even know your name
[50:20] see what i'm saying
[50:22] so
[50:22] i'm not telling a lie
[50:25] i got to stand before god
[50:27] and give an answer to god for what i say
[50:31] are you with me
[50:33] now i can say well i believe
[50:36] and i think
[50:37] that's all we can do believe it too
[50:40] because that's even on the best
[50:42] the most faithful child of god only
[50:44] thing you can do is to believe by the
[50:46] grace of god that they made it
[50:48] you know
[50:49] and and and you want to believe that
[50:51] with your heart and you got a joy and a
[50:53] peace about it
[50:55] but when you ain't got that peace
[50:58] you know god knows whether or not you
[51:00] got that peace
[51:01] about whether you give an account for
[51:03] this soul you need to help
[51:06] and you want to do it willingly and you
[51:08] want to do it with peace
[51:10] amen
[51:12] so it's a very difficult task
[51:16] that
[51:16] a
[51:17] a pastor has
[51:20] because he
[51:21] and and that's why my bishop used to
[51:23] always say i don't want nobody blood on
[51:25] my hand
[51:27] he said that's why i'm telling y'all the
[51:28] truth
[51:29] because the blood would be on my hand if
[51:31] i didn't tell you the truth
[51:33] and i'm gonna tell you something as
[51:34] parents the blood will be on your hand
[51:36] if you don't really if you don't raise
[51:38] these children right just as the blood
[51:41] on the path to hand the blood don't be
[51:42] on your hand and you look at that child
[51:45] and you say well you know
[51:47] the same word
[51:49] that i preach insane bible that you read
[51:52] amen it tells you what your
[51:54] responsibilities are and how you ought
[51:56] to conduct yourself as a parent are you
[51:59] with me it tells me how to i should
[52:02] conduct myself as a parent and as a
[52:04] pastor
[52:06] are you a friend
[52:07] now if i conduct myself otherwise
[52:10] then i got somebody that's over me
[52:13] are you with me
[52:14] and that's god
[52:16] are you with me
[52:18] the same way in the house
[52:20] amen it's got a
[52:23] the husband is the head
[52:25] of the wife
[52:26] and the children are subject to their
[52:28] parents are you with me
[52:30] so that's a
[52:31] now we disrespect
[52:33] and we just
[52:34] we disrespect
[52:36] that order we're disrespecting not the
[52:38] person you're disrespecting god's word
[52:42] and you're going to be accountable not
[52:44] to that person you're going to be
[52:46] accountable to god for disrespecting his
[52:49] word
[52:50] so when we overstep the word
[52:53] then we're telling god i don't care what
[52:55] you say
[52:57] you know you you know just just say to
[53:00] the husband i don't care what you say uh
[53:03] i i i it's disrespectable
[53:06] you got to respect
[53:08] with humility and in love amen even when
[53:15] one is wrong
[53:17] you still got to give that you know
[53:20] suppose the police jack you up thinking
[53:23] you somebody else and you said you
[53:25] jacking me up huh
[53:27] no you got to get respect
[53:29] he got the wrong person but you give him
[53:31] respect i need to believe and hopefully
[53:33] we can work this thing out and find out
[53:35] you know what i'm saying so what happens
[53:38] amen
[53:39] i don't say
[53:41] everything going to be
[53:42] straight up right all the time some
[53:44] things
[53:45] it's going to be misunderstood
[53:47] something's going to be uh wrong
[53:49] sometimes but you have to
[53:51] you you have to be able to bear
[53:54] what if the least little thing came up
[53:56] in a marriage you run off i can't take
[53:58] no more i'm gone
[54:00] leave the children leave the family you
[54:02] know i'm gone
[54:03] i ain't taking nothing that's no more
[54:05] i'm tired of it
[54:06] just walk off children everything
[54:09] how many times we've seen that
[54:13] people got tired quick
[54:16] the children left without a
[54:18] father or maybe left without a mother
[54:21] because somebody got tired
[54:23] are you with me
[54:25] so what we got to do we have to bear one
[54:28] another burdens
[54:30] amen when one is down that one's picking
[54:32] up you know because every day amen one
[54:35] person might be up to date the other one
[54:37] might be down tomorrow so we have to
[54:39] lift one another up
[54:41] sometimes the church got to encourage
[54:43] the preaching sometimes the preachers
[54:45] encourage the church it should be vice
[54:47] versa you know what i'm saying sometimes
[54:49] i i need your help i need your that the
[54:52] encouragement from you and sometimes
[54:54] you're looking for encouragement for me
[54:56] and we have one another we all need one
[54:58] another are you what man
[55:00] so so by the grace of god we bow one
[55:03] another but we got to be humbled enough
[55:05] to realize amen that god has placed us
[55:09] in the body amen to
[55:12] work in your particular position are you
[55:14] with me
[55:16] the failure to do that
[55:18] is to overlook the word of god
[55:21] okay
[55:22] now
[55:24] uh
[55:25] caleb you wanna
[55:26] no i was reading
[55:28] you show me
[55:30] you show me a church that's humble
[55:32] real humble not arrogant church
[55:35] just sweet humble church
[55:38] and i'll show you a church that has
[55:40] favor and power of god
[55:43] that's right
[55:45] that's
[55:46] that's the thing it takes
[55:49] humility humbling ourselves before god
[55:53] and letting god just work through us
[55:57] don't have
[55:59] to make a lot of noise
[56:02] you know
[56:04] just humbling ourselves
[56:05] oh you're with me
[56:08] maybe i'll uh i want to have ernest i
[56:11] mean caleb durie but
[56:13] it's very important that
[56:15] when we when we're humble
[56:17] the prophet of god said people can come
[56:19] through that door
[56:21] if everybody just be humble and just
[56:23] love one another forgiving one another
[56:25] people walk through that door
[56:27] and you wouldn't have to pray for the
[56:29] sick they would be healed you miracles
[56:32] signs and wonders you never have to
[56:34] touch them it just be just a glorious
[56:37] place to be in his presence it's it's
[56:40] just that you got a a group of humble
[56:43] people people that love one another
[56:46] concern and care about one another he
[56:48] said the power of god to be so great
[56:51] and that's what we are i think we in
[56:53] order to be rapture ready we got to move
[56:55] into that cycle brothers fred that's
[56:58] what we're moving into i believe that's
[57:00] you know when i started with these
[57:02] lessons
[57:03] you know
[57:04] i i i usually don't really greet the
[57:07] saints but shake the you know you know
[57:09] pop them on the hand or whatever
[57:12] and then last night something happened
[57:14] different
[57:15] i got out a little early and uh
[57:18] going to the car and then i was shaking
[57:19] on another hand
[57:21] and then i was hearing the testimonies i
[57:23] said oh
[57:24] oh and then i realized
[57:26] but but i already knew
[57:28] that
[57:29] god was doing something special he's
[57:32] getting us ready
[57:33] for rapture
[57:35] and the only way we're going to get
[57:36] ready for rapture we're going to have to
[57:38] i ain't talking about y'all i'm talking
[57:40] about all of us i'm talking about me too
[57:43] we gotta it takes
[57:45] we gotta improve on our attitudes and
[57:48] how we conduct ourselves and how we
[57:50] speak amen it's gotta take it's got to
[57:53] be a lot of grace season with soul
[57:56] amen we're going to have to have a lot
[57:58] of humility
[57:59] amen the thing is when we get to the
[58:02] point that we say i ain't taking nothing
[58:04] off that's the wrong kind of attitude to
[58:06] have
[58:08] and somebody did me this and somebody
[58:10] did me that somebody's gonna do you that
[58:12] till you die
[58:14] there's always somebody gonna do
[58:15] something wrong do you wrong
[58:18] and we're gonna do
[58:20] even uh unconsciously we'll do one
[58:23] another wrong
[58:24] and not even know it
[58:27] unless somebody tell us
[58:29] you know what i'm saying you'll never
[58:31] know what's going on in a person's mind
[58:34] listen they speak it out
[58:36] you know y'all you know i'm always
[58:38] marrying counseling and all but if you
[58:41] don't if the hug if you don't
[58:43] communicate one with another the
[58:45] marriage won't work
[58:47] you got to be able to tell that wife
[58:49] what's on your what you're going through
[58:50] what you thinking what's on your mind
[58:52] and vice versa and y'all got to sit down
[58:54] y'all got to listen
[58:57] and my wife was just bringing it out she
[58:59] said
[58:59] you know
[59:02] she was just sharing with me and some of
[59:04] the children i don't know who i was
[59:06] there and she said you know
[59:08] this open door here
[59:10] we can sit down around the table
[59:13] and you know with our little bible study
[59:15] and we can talk about things
[59:17] whatever you're going through let's talk
[59:19] about it
[59:21] are you with me
[59:22] she said you know
[59:24] everybody grown but we still doing the
[59:26] same thing
[59:27] you get around the table you have your
[59:29] body let's talk about not just the you
[59:32] know bible but what you're going to
[59:34] what you know
[59:36] and you know you can't live in a house
[59:38] and not hurt one another feeling
[59:41] you know i'm saying everybody hurt one
[59:42] another feeling one time or another
[59:44] but we learn how to what work through it
[59:46] because we're going to what
[59:48] communicate we're going to talk about it
[59:50] we're going to work other than that we
[59:52] want i'm going
[59:54] i'm getting out of here you know what
[59:56] i'm saying but because we communicate we
[59:58] can work through it and because we love
[1:00:01] one another we gonna work through it
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:04] and it takes time
[1:00:06] i don't y'all got me
[1:00:10] the night i ain't supposed to be talking
[1:00:11] i just want to be on this lesson
[1:00:13] okay let me go back y'all all right
[1:00:16] ain't god good
[1:00:19] communication is is a key
[1:00:22] are you with me
[1:00:24] so ernest
[1:00:26] now where we were obedience and become
[1:00:28] obedient unto death
[1:00:30] even the death of the cross now
[1:00:33] you know the bible you know they sing
[1:00:36] the song you didn't have to do it but he
[1:00:37] did
[1:00:39] you know
[1:00:40] he had to fulfill what was written of
[1:00:42] him you know what i'm saying
[1:00:44] but
[1:00:46] he said i got power to call 12 legion of
[1:00:48] angels
[1:00:50] you know i can do that
[1:00:52] i want to
[1:00:54] if you had a little bit of that power
[1:00:56] that you can call one angel
[1:00:59] man
[1:01:00] i don't know what kind of condition the
[1:01:02] world would be in
[1:01:04] if you can call one angel
[1:01:08] and all the
[1:01:09] craziness and all the filth and all the
[1:01:11] ungodly stuff going on what would you do
[1:01:14] if you can call one angel
[1:01:16] to hamlet
[1:01:18] or will you look beyond the people
[1:01:20] faults
[1:01:22] and say mercy mercy mercy
[1:01:25] and you know that's what jesus did with
[1:01:27] all the power
[1:01:29] that he had
[1:01:30] i
[1:01:31] i i think it was killed i said you know
[1:01:33] he uses he didn't use his power to
[1:01:36] destroy
[1:01:38] he didn't use his power
[1:01:40] to
[1:01:41] to
[1:01:42] to low rate or down somebody
[1:01:45] or think he was better than them
[1:01:48] when somebody was down and low
[1:01:51] the woman caught in the very act of
[1:01:53] adultery the woman with five husband and
[1:01:56] the one she had wasn't her he didn't use
[1:01:59] his power to say
[1:02:02] you know what i have to do with you no
[1:02:04] but you know the pharisees did if he had
[1:02:07] known who that woman was that was
[1:02:10] wiping his feet with her hair and all of
[1:02:13] that she was you know this is a faint
[1:02:15] woman what's she doing down there that's
[1:02:16] a holy man supposed to be you know what
[1:02:18] i'm saying and that's what uh but jesus
[1:02:21] never made
[1:02:22] he meant
[1:02:24] probably you know
[1:02:26] the lords of sinners
[1:02:28] he never showed them
[1:02:30] ah he was sent out
[1:02:32] he showed compassion and love
[1:02:35] you know and see
[1:02:37] once he said let this mind be in you
[1:02:40] with all the power and all authority he
[1:02:42] had he could have said stone her
[1:02:46] and go get the man too and stone both of
[1:02:48] them
[1:02:50] because that's what the scripture said
[1:02:52] but he came with the love and humility
[1:02:55] not to shame or embarrass anybody but to
[1:02:58] love him
[1:03:00] are you with me
[1:03:01] so it took it took a a humble god to be
[1:03:05] so merciful and so kind and so loving to
[1:03:08] us
[1:03:10] in each and every day because we live
[1:03:14] we got to thank god for just living
[1:03:17] day by day
[1:03:19] it's
[1:03:22] the bible said he became obedient to
[1:03:24] death go head on
[1:03:27] even the cross
[1:03:28] where wherefore god also has highly
[1:03:31] exalted him now
[1:03:33] see sometimes i you know
[1:03:35] people want to be famous they want to be
[1:03:37] great
[1:03:38] you know
[1:03:41] oftentimes i just want to get off the
[1:03:43] air don't want to get on
[1:03:44] because i'm not interested in
[1:03:47] people hearing me or seeing me or
[1:03:49] knowing who i am or whatever
[1:03:52] but
[1:03:54] i know some people that
[1:03:57] you know i i stay because of the
[1:04:00] encouraging words of different ones that
[1:04:02] encourage me this is brett simmons thank
[1:04:05] you
[1:04:06] and i said okay
[1:04:08] thank
[1:04:08] uh
[1:04:10] i was about to get off i was about to
[1:04:12] tell them forget about that
[1:04:14] but because it encouraged somebody then
[1:04:17] i just hold out a little while longer
[1:04:19] are you with me
[1:04:21] and sometimes people have conditions and
[1:04:23] things in their life but
[1:04:25] brother and sister
[1:04:27] it's
[1:04:29] we're here
[1:04:30] but sometimes we're not listening to the
[1:04:32] word at all because our minds and our
[1:04:34] intention is our focus is always it's
[1:04:37] somewhere else
[1:04:39] you know why somewhere else
[1:04:41] a lack of humility
[1:04:43] we are self-confident
[1:04:47] it's almost like leosia said we have
[1:04:48] needed nothing
[1:04:51] you know and god is trying to get us in
[1:04:53] a condition that we could be ready for
[1:04:55] rapture but how can we be ready for
[1:04:57] rapture
[1:04:58] and we can't even deal with ourselves
[1:05:02] are you with me
[1:05:03] we're not willing to humble ourselves
[1:05:05] how can we deal with god
[1:05:07] you know sometimes we think well you
[1:05:09] know
[1:05:11] you know i'm so i i i i'm so holy i'm so
[1:05:15] righteous and i'm so just and i'm so
[1:05:17] glad that when i get to heaven i say it
[1:05:20] ain't it's a pleasure one brother told
[1:05:22] me
[1:05:23] you know i
[1:05:24] took
[1:05:25] took care of him and did everything
[1:05:27] for him and he said
[1:05:29] you know
[1:05:31] you know take care
[1:05:33] whatever i can do everything i could do
[1:05:35] for him and when i did it all he said
[1:05:38] oh yeah yeah
[1:05:41] y'all it's a blessing for y'all to do
[1:05:43] that
[1:05:45] y'all get a blessing for doing that for
[1:05:46] me
[1:05:48] or something like that he was arrogant i
[1:05:50] said man you eric and something
[1:05:53] and i sure wouldn't want no woman to
[1:05:54] marry you
[1:05:56] you know
[1:05:58] you know because he thought this is the
[1:06:00] way you're supposed to do
[1:06:01] you know y'all supposed to do this for
[1:06:03] me you know i'm saying no no no no no
[1:06:06] that's the wrong kind of attitude
[1:06:08] god don't have to die for he didn't have
[1:06:11] to die for us he died because he loved
[1:06:14] us
[1:06:15] he was trying to show us
[1:06:17] how he wanted us to conduct our lives
[1:06:19] the kind of person
[1:06:22] or get the kind of sons and daughters he
[1:06:24] wanted
[1:06:26] are you with me
[1:06:27] you want your children
[1:06:29] to be like you
[1:06:31] you know what i'm saying but you got to
[1:06:33] if you want them to be like you
[1:06:36] then you got to be like christ
[1:06:38] are you with me
[1:06:40] don't want your children to be like you
[1:06:45] if
[1:06:47] you know what i'm saying
[1:06:48] i ain't gonna say it let's go
[1:06:51] no wherefore god hath god also have
[1:06:54] highly exalted him and given him a name
[1:06:57] which is above every name
[1:06:59] that at the name of jesus every knee
[1:07:02] should bow of things in heaven and
[1:07:04] things in earth and things under the
[1:07:06] earth and that every tongue should
[1:07:08] confess that jesus christ is lord to the
[1:07:11] glory of god the father
[1:07:14] wherefore my beloved that's good that's
[1:07:17] good that's good
[1:07:18] god has all exhorted him and given him a
[1:07:20] name which is above every name
[1:07:23] now let's go to um
[1:07:25] colossians 2.
[1:07:51] and uh one
[1:07:56] colossians two and one for i would that
[1:07:59] you knew what great conflict i have for
[1:08:01] you yes and for them at laodicea and for
[1:08:04] as many as have not seen my face in the
[1:08:08] flesh
[1:08:08] that their hearts might be comforted
[1:08:11] being knit together in love and unto all
[1:08:14] riches
[1:08:15] of the full assurance of understanding
[1:08:18] to the acknowledgement
[1:08:20] of the mysteries of god let's go to
[1:08:22] colossians 3
[1:08:24] and 1.
[1:08:37] go ahead
[1:08:38] if you've even if you then be risen with
[1:08:41] christ seek those things which are above
[1:08:44] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:08:46] of god
[1:08:47] set your affection on the things above
[1:08:49] and not on the things of earth
[1:08:50] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[1:08:53] with christ and god
[1:08:55] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:08:58] then shall ye also appear with him in
[1:09:00] glory
[1:09:01] mortified therefore your members which
[1:09:03] are upon the earth fornication
[1:09:06] uncleanness
[1:09:07] that's what we got to do mortify
[1:09:10] our members upon this earth
[1:09:12] fornication
[1:09:14] you got to get rid of you got to fight
[1:09:16] it you got to it's got to die
[1:09:18] it's got to rot now
[1:09:21] you can't just let it just
[1:09:24] that spirit
[1:09:26] that spirit that come against you that
[1:09:28] spirit that attitude
[1:09:33] young people have to fight that spirit
[1:09:36] that demon got to die
[1:09:39] are you with me
[1:09:43] go ahead and read on
[1:09:44] fornication uncleanness
[1:09:47] in order to reflection
[1:09:49] evil in order to confession
[1:09:52] doing things
[1:09:54] that pornography can show you how to do
[1:09:56] all kind of
[1:09:58] stuff
[1:09:59] filled
[1:10:00] from out of the pits of hell
[1:10:05] most of the time these children get
[1:10:07] caught up sin
[1:10:08] and they get hooked on that stuff
[1:10:12] sometimes they ain't 10 years old when
[1:10:13] they hook
[1:10:15] they got a telephone
[1:10:19] and they hooked
[1:10:23] parents don't even know they hooked
[1:10:26] next thing you know
[1:10:28] they got in inaudible affection
[1:10:33] they ought to be a man
[1:10:36] like to talk to a woman it's all kind of
[1:10:38] crazy felt ungodly stuff
[1:10:41] demon powers that people young people
[1:10:44] get
[1:10:46] addicted to
[1:10:47] at an early age
[1:10:49] and say take god almighty to drive those
[1:10:52] demons away
[1:10:54] that's a strong powerful spirit
[1:11:11] if you get the inaudible ghost the holy
[1:11:12] ghost will teach you
[1:11:16] it'll guide you
[1:11:18] these powerful spirits out here
[1:11:21] you can't give place to the devil
[1:11:25] you got to resist the devil
[1:11:28] the only way you're going to resist the
[1:11:29] devil you got to be humble
[1:11:33] if you're not humble you're going to do
[1:11:35] what you want to do
[1:11:38] but when you're humble jesus amen
[1:11:40] thought of not wrong
[1:11:42] to be equal with god but he made himself
[1:11:44] no reputation
[1:11:46] took upon in the form of servant
[1:11:49] servant
[1:11:50] and humbled himself
[1:11:56] this is going to be obedient to god are
[1:11:58] you going to be obedient to god
[1:12:00] if you're going to be obedient to god it
[1:12:02] takes
[1:12:03] understanding that i'm not
[1:12:04] you know
[1:12:07] joseph said
[1:12:08] you know we realized we were just dust
[1:12:12] who are we anyway entity that has made
[1:12:14] us not we are we got to humble ourselves
[1:12:17] realize how frail we are
[1:12:20] and how short time a man has to live
[1:12:23] and why can't we live for god the one
[1:12:25] that made us and created us
[1:12:28] if we give it back to god look at oh how
[1:12:31] blessed we'll be
[1:12:33] but if we don't get
[1:12:38] read on i gotta go
[1:12:40] evil concupisces
[1:12:42] and covertness which is idolatry for
[1:12:44] which things which for which things say
[1:12:47] the wrath of god cometh upon the
[1:12:49] children of disobedience the wrath of
[1:12:51] god comes on the children of
[1:12:52] disobedience
[1:12:54] now jesus was obedient
[1:12:57] unto death
[1:12:58] even the death of the cross
[1:13:01] and see we got to be obedient
[1:13:04] to mortify our members upon the earth
[1:13:08] but it takes humility to do it jesus the
[1:13:10] bible said he humbled himself to do it
[1:13:13] amen the captain of our salvation be
[1:13:16] made perfect through suffering he
[1:13:18] suffered for a reason
[1:13:21] amen because he was going to be
[1:13:23] victorious even in his suffering
[1:13:27] he's going to show us the way to victory
[1:13:30] amen he's going to lead us how we going
[1:13:33] to defeat death
[1:13:35] by defeating self
[1:13:43] the problem is that folks look at other
[1:13:46] folk and look at other folk and they
[1:13:50] want to be like other folk you got to
[1:13:52] look at jesus
[1:13:55] and be like jesus
[1:13:58] humility
[1:14:01] joseph never got what he got
[1:14:04] except he was humble
[1:14:08] are you with me
[1:14:10] and many times amen
[1:14:13] in order to
[1:14:14] be king it takes humility
[1:14:18] are you with me
[1:14:21] so god wants to take us to higher hikes
[1:14:24] and deeper depths but he cannot do it if
[1:14:26] you think that because i fast and i pray
[1:14:29] and i seek god oh that's the attitude
[1:14:31] that's oh i pray all the time i fast all
[1:14:34] the time that's just you
[1:14:38] it's almost like that sinner that just
[1:14:40] couldn't lift up his head and just said
[1:14:42] lord
[1:14:44] he didn't you know tell the lord i do
[1:14:46] this should i do that
[1:14:48] he said he give me a sinner
[1:14:51] you know what i'm saying
[1:14:53] i'm just a sinner lord forgive me that
[1:14:56] other fellow done done all of this and
[1:14:58] all of that
[1:15:00] he thought he you know yeah i'm blessed
[1:15:05] you know what i'm saying
[1:15:06] sometimes we just ought to just you know
[1:15:08] look at god and say god i need your
[1:15:10] merch and grace every day
[1:15:12] i can't never do enough good enough for
[1:15:15] your lord i ain't i did nothing for you
[1:15:17] anyway because all i ever done he meant
[1:15:19] you did it
[1:15:21] i give you the glory you did it i
[1:15:24] couldn't do it myself anyway because if
[1:15:26] it's ever done for god it was done for
[1:15:28] his glory
[1:15:30] praise god but if if you had done it
[1:15:34] you know sometimes you know
[1:15:37] i think sometimes we think the lord owed
[1:15:39] us
[1:15:40] we did so much for god that god owed us
[1:15:43] something
[1:15:44] you know
[1:15:45] this disciples said lord we left all to
[1:15:47] follow you
[1:15:48] you know what i'm saying
[1:15:51] and he said no man is left father mother
[1:15:53] sister
[1:15:55] and not in this world receive what
[1:15:58] a wonderful
[1:16:00] in the word to come eternal life
[1:16:02] that's why you cannot you know the
[1:16:06] person that know all the words you can't
[1:16:07] help them you know why because they know
[1:16:09] more than you
[1:16:10] you'll never help them
[1:16:13] you know a teacher have struggled with a
[1:16:15] student that you know sometimes
[1:16:17] they know more than the teacher
[1:16:21] but the teacher
[1:16:22] is in
[1:16:23] in that condition but a student just is
[1:16:26] just smarter with but that student that
[1:16:28] might be smarter than the teacher knows
[1:16:30] how to subject themselves because that
[1:16:33] teacher got the power to give them my a
[1:16:35] of
[1:16:36] f
[1:16:37] no matter what they know
[1:16:39] you see what i'm saying
[1:16:41] it takes a humility due respect amen i
[1:16:44] might know
[1:16:46] that i almost failed one time
[1:16:50] teacher would be half sleep
[1:16:52] and she'd wake up giving the people the
[1:16:54] wrong answer
[1:16:56] and i said no i missed someone's son the
[1:16:58] answer is someone's son in all the
[1:17:00] classes they laugh and she get upset
[1:17:04] and she'll come again about lunch time
[1:17:06] we get up she didn't eat you go to sleep
[1:17:09] mm-hmm and she gave her the wrong answer
[1:17:12] i said no miss on and you know what she
[1:17:14] did flunk all my little chin section
[1:17:18] and i made it out with a d
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:24] so
[1:17:25] and all of them went to summer school
[1:17:28] you see what i'm saying it's because
[1:17:31] you know we would have you know i'm uh
[1:17:35] you know you're just having fun you know
[1:17:37] but but you understand you
[1:17:40] you you you in school you got to get
[1:17:43] respect
[1:17:44] you got to give respect to that teacher
[1:17:48] are you with me
[1:17:49] when you disrespect that t but all of
[1:17:52] that little chill texting could have
[1:17:54] you know we could have aced the class
[1:17:55] probably
[1:17:57] but because we were young
[1:18:00] you know i might as well say young and
[1:18:02] dumb
[1:18:03] you know think we being smart playing
[1:18:06] around
[1:18:08] instead of being humble
[1:18:10] you know what i'm saying
[1:18:11] and you know i look back at it i said
[1:18:13] you know
[1:18:14] shouldn't have done that
[1:18:16] you know but when you got confidence in
[1:18:18] your little flesh you know a little
[1:18:20] something
[1:18:22] you know it's hard to know a little
[1:18:23] something and not you know get puffed up
[1:18:25] the bible said knowledge what
[1:18:28] puffs up but charity what
[1:18:30] when you know a little something it's
[1:18:32] kind of hard that's why you can't give
[1:18:34] certain people certain things
[1:18:37] you know what i'm saying
[1:18:41] i got it
[1:18:44] i'm going to try to skip
[1:18:48] see because
[1:18:49] i miss
[1:18:51] you know what happened to me i was
[1:18:52] looking for a scripture in my head
[1:18:55] i know what book is in
[1:18:58] and i thought i knew exactly where it

[1:24:06] the kind is that's what he would say
[1:24:10] brother and sister that's what i'm
[1:24:11] saying god wants to change us all away
[1:24:15] as individuals amen you want us to put

[1:24:25] soul salvation with fear and trembling
[1:24:28] that you got god got to work on you but
[1:24:31] you got to
[1:24:32] humble what
[1:24:34] yourself until you're willing to be
[1:24:36] subject to the word and humbling
[1:24:38] yourself then the word ain't going to do
[1:24:40] you no good
[1:24:42] the word can help you if you don't want
[1:24:45] no help
[1:24:46] are you with me
[1:24:48] the only way the word can help you
[1:24:50] you're going you're gonna have to look
[1:24:51] at yourself and see what you need
[1:24:54] improvements
[1:24:56] i said we all need improvement
[1:24:58] and i want an improvement in me
[1:25:01] amen i want i want y'all to see amen on
[1:25:05] the ministry and i want you to say hey

[1:25:13] want oh yeah
[1:25:15] god didn't help that brother
[1:25:18] and i said thank the lord god help me
[1:25:20] but you got to look at ourselves and say
[1:25:22] hey did god help me
[1:25:25] see what i'm saying because when god
[1:25:27] helped me
[1:25:28] it it
[1:25:30] it's me that he helped but
[1:25:32] we got to know whether it reached you
[1:25:34] that didn't rub off on you and it caused
[1:25:37] you to be helped also
[1:25:39] are you with me so as we see ourselves
[1:25:41] uh nearing the rapture and then the
[1:25:43] coming of the lord we all
[1:25:46] amen uh
[1:25:47] you know let's
[1:25:49] let's put on the new man
[1:25:51] okay
[1:25:52] so
[1:25:53] let's let's this is
[1:25:55] kindness harmonies of what
[1:25:59] mine
[1:26:01] i'm gonna tell you something
[1:26:03] you get a good good job and making a
[1:26:04] little money and driving a little car a
[1:26:06] little house and all that now you're
[1:26:08] gonna have to oh
[1:26:10] you something to fool you're something
[1:26:11] to mess with
[1:26:14] you can't tell them they ain't got it
[1:26:15] made
[1:26:16] lord have mercy you're gonna have to
[1:26:18] humble yourself
[1:26:20] are you with me now it doesn't matter
[1:26:23] how humble
[1:26:24] we can say ourselves i'm already humble
[1:26:28] you know
[1:26:28] i'm humble i'm just as humble as can be
[1:26:31] i get along with everybody
[1:26:34] everybody that you want to get along
[1:26:36] with
[1:26:38] the other people they just don't like me
[1:26:41] they don't don't like me because i
[1:26:43] straighten them out
[1:26:45] i mean you want to get along
[1:26:48] with those that you have to straighten
[1:26:50] out
[1:26:51] you understand
[1:26:53] they ought to feel the humility in you
[1:26:56] the kindness in you the love of god
[1:26:59] that's in you
[1:27:00] and that's what we want we want the
[1:27:02] radiance of the love of god
[1:27:06] to be flowing from you in such a way
[1:27:08] that a person can tell oh god
[1:27:12] yeah
[1:27:13] even though it's correction that you
[1:27:15] have to correct
[1:27:16] amen but it must be correcting in love
[1:27:21] are you with me because if there's no
[1:27:23] love in your correction
[1:27:25] then it's not going to receive well
[1:27:27] brother i want to tell you so and so on
[1:27:29] about yourself
[1:27:31] oh okay
[1:27:33] thank you
[1:27:34] but is it received
[1:27:36] it's
[1:27:37] not what you say like i said the other
[1:27:39] day it's not what i said to my wife
[1:27:42] it's how i said it
[1:27:45] and it hurt i said it hurt me it hurt
[1:27:48] her
[1:27:50] because i said it
[1:27:52] and i i could hear it come back and hit
[1:27:54] me hard
[1:27:55] i said that's the lord the lord doesn't
[1:27:57] hit me i said i'm sorry you know what
[1:28:00] i'm saying see because i know i said it
[1:28:04] the wrong way
[1:28:06] you see what i'm saying
[1:28:08] and
[1:28:09] and that that's what that's what happens
[1:28:11] you've got to have some humility
[1:28:14] you got to respect one another if you
[1:28:16] love one another you don't want to hurt
[1:28:17] one another
[1:28:19] are you with me
[1:28:22] so if it takes a change in the you say
[1:28:24] it ain't too late it ain't too late to
[1:28:27] change it's time not just to pray and
[1:28:30] lord let me be humble
[1:28:32] you got to be humble but take your stand
[1:28:34] for the word
[1:28:37] but how can i take a stand for the word
[1:28:39] because i don't know how to take a stand
[1:28:42] for the word and not be who i am not who
[1:28:45] you are who christ is
[1:28:48] see because we got to get you out the
[1:28:50] picture
[1:28:51] and we got to see god give me wisdom
[1:28:53] give me
[1:28:54] you're going to use
[1:28:56] this old vessel but you're going to use
[1:28:59] it where amen you know how to operate me
[1:29:03] amen if i can just yield and let you
[1:29:06] operate
[1:29:08] are you with me
[1:29:09] see what i'm saying god amen knows how
[1:29:13] amen how he wants to use you
[1:29:17] are you with me
[1:29:18] but you got to allow him by yielding to
[1:29:21] him it takes some praying on you
[1:29:26] lord help me
[1:29:28] amen help me amen to be more
[1:29:30] compassionate and more humble amen
[1:29:34] help me
[1:29:35] lord
[1:29:36] because that's that's the way i want to
[1:29:38] be i want to be rapture ready i want him
[1:29:41] to say well done
[1:29:43] praise god because we overcome this
[1:29:45] flesh we got to overcome something amen

[1:30:08] bring this body under subjection and if
[1:30:11] i can bring this flesh on this ejection

[1:33:26] y'all if i have i done your own forgive
[1:33:28] me
[1:33:30] are you with me
[1:33:32] i tell the whole church to forgive me
[1:33:34] i'm not ashamed i know i know i can say
[1:33:36] something wrong
[1:33:38] you know and i know
[1:33:41] that it's impossible
[1:33:44] james said the man don't offend the word
[1:33:46] the same as a perfect man
[1:33:48] are you with me
[1:33:50] and i'm striving for perfection
[1:33:52] but while i'm striving for it
[1:33:54] i make mistakes just like you
[1:33:58] are you with me
[1:34:00] so i ask for i ask for forgiveness all
[1:34:02] the time but y'all might see him well he
[1:34:04] asking for forgiveness
[1:34:06] yeah because sometimes i might have said
[1:34:08] something unintentionally
[1:34:10] to offend somebody
[1:34:11] didn't mean it
[1:34:13] all right and he said well that's that's
[1:34:14] a word as long as you're preaching no
[1:34:16] sometimes you can preach it and you can
[1:34:17] get a little bit in yourself
[1:34:20] y'all understand that don't you
[1:34:22] that's why you have to pray for the man
[1:34:23] of god that he don't get in his flesh
[1:34:26] that god
[1:34:27] be in control are you with me
[1:34:36] it says
[1:34:40] if any man have a quarrel against
[1:34:42] any
[1:34:43] even as christ
[1:34:45] forgave you
[1:34:46] so also what
[1:34:53] well i tell you the truth
[1:34:55] i just i know what you did and i know
[1:34:58] you did that 10 years ago or five months
[1:35:01] ago six years ago and i just don't trust
[1:35:04] you that ain't good to say
[1:35:08] even if you're thinking don't say it
[1:35:10] please
[1:35:12] ask god to give you some mercy where you
[1:35:13] can trust them
[1:35:16] amen
[1:35:18] because they might do it 70 times a day
[1:35:21] and you still have to forgive them
[1:35:24] i ain't going to let them do it again
[1:35:26] lord
[1:35:27] i'm i'm gonna tell you what if they
[1:35:28] don't do it again somebody else gonna do
[1:35:30] it
[1:35:32] the thing that you say i ain't gonna let
[1:35:34] that person do it again you better let
[1:35:36] that you at least you see them
[1:35:38] because god is trying to perfect you
[1:35:41] and so if god let that thing come
[1:35:43] against you in a certain way then god is
[1:35:45] saying this is what it takes to perfect
[1:35:47] you
[1:35:49] whatever god allows
[1:35:51] then all things will work together to
[1:35:53] what
[1:35:54] the good what i ain't that nah no no no
[1:35:57] no it's things in life that you ain't
[1:35:58] gonna get around because if god allowed
[1:36:01] and you know you
[1:36:02] walking in god's
[1:36:04] path that god has led you in then you
[1:36:06] stay there in the path that god led you
[1:36:09] but
[1:36:10] when we try to avoid
[1:36:12] the things that god chastised uh i mean
[1:36:15] so what
[1:36:17] baby david said
[1:36:19] and he's throwing that jobbling at me
[1:36:22] boom he almost killed me and i had to
[1:36:25] run for my life and he did i got a
[1:36:27] chance to kill him
[1:36:28] you know but david just cut a little
[1:36:31] thing off a song you know and said let's
[1:36:33] all know i could have he could have
[1:36:35] killed saul right but he didn't do it he
[1:36:38] said he touched not god's anointing and

[1:49:50] no matter what
[1:49:52] the whole the rest of the world is going
[1:49:53] after the church world i said god give
[1:49:56] us a word in season
[1:49:58] something that we know we in tune with
[1:49:59] you and what you want your people to
[1:50:01] hear in the hour that they live in
[1:50:04] how many desire that today
[1:50:06] to be in tune with what god is doing
[1:50:08] i know that's my heart's desire
[1:50:11] but the only way we gonna uh fulfill
[1:50:12] that desire is we're gonna have to let
[1:50:14] go and let god have his way
[1:50:16] and get rid of our desires our own will
[1:50:18] and say god i want your will and that's
[1:50:21] my desire
[1:50:22] even here tonight i thank god for the
[1:50:24] word i was telling my wife the other day
[1:50:26] on the job
[1:50:28] one of the guys he
[1:50:29] he was telling me he's like did you know
[1:50:31] what they said to me and just telling me
[1:50:33] a remark that was made in a meeting
[1:50:36] and i said i was picking at him i said
[1:50:38] that hurt your feelings
[1:50:40] i said because you you expect them to be
[1:50:42] somebody
[1:50:44] i said when you when you want to be
[1:50:45] somebody when they make those remarks
[1:50:47] that hurt your feelings
[1:50:49] and i got one of the other guys and we
[1:50:50] started laughing i said see we don't
[1:50:52] expect to be nobody so they can say all
[1:50:54] kinds of things that it won't bother us
[1:50:57] but that's what it is
[1:50:58] even in the in the kingdom of god even
[1:51:01] though we are the bride of christ
[1:51:03] we realize that we're only
[1:51:05] his bride because of election
[1:51:08] we're only here because of his election
[1:51:11] and his grace
[1:51:13] the last
[1:51:14] couple days it's the word men in my
[1:51:16] mouth lord you've been so gracious to me
[1:51:18] because that's what it is all it is
[1:51:21] recognizing that you only
[1:51:24] where you are in life you only
[1:51:27] can achieve whatever
[1:51:29] you may have achieved
[1:51:30] is only be by the grace of god
[1:51:33] when you look back
[1:51:34] over your life god could have dealt you
[1:51:36] a hand that he dealt somebody else
[1:51:38] but he didn't desire to do that
[1:51:40] but he thought about you
[1:51:42] when he was hanging on that cross
[1:51:44] he thought about you when he was taking
[1:51:46] those whips when they let him spit on
[1:51:49] them when he could have called a legion
[1:51:51] of angels but he thought about you
[1:51:54] he said i gotta go the distance because
[1:51:56] i know that they gonna need me
[1:51:58] without the shedding of blood there
[1:52:00] wouldn't be no remission of sins so he
[1:52:02] had to go that way for you and i
[1:52:04] and i'm so glad
[1:52:06] that he did
[1:52:07] that's all that's my whole testimony i
[1:52:09] can only rejoice and tell you about what
[1:52:11] he's done
