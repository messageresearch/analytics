Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, let the Holy Ghost come on down. &gt;&gt; Genesis 22, we'll begin at the at the uh let's begin at the first verse. If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham, and he said, Behold, here am I. Here I am." And he said, "Take thou now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Mariah, and offer him, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee." And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clay the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place which God have told him. You may be seated. I'm going to read a little further down. Fourth verse says, "Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. And Abraham said unto his young men, "Bide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder, and worship, and come again unto you." And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand, and a knife. And they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, "My father." And he said, "Here am I. I my son. And he said, "Behold the fire in the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a burnt offering." So they went both they went both of them together. And they beca and they came to the place which is called wi-i which God had told him of. And Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here am I. And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing, thou has not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me." And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by thorns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in thestead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra, as it is said to this day, in the mount of the Lord, it shall be seen. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, said the Lord, for because thou has done this thing, and has not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee. In multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the shore. And thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice. May God add a bless to the reading of his word. That sounds good, don't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. To be blessed like that, ain't it? &gt;&gt; But what got him the blessing was his obedience. How many believe that this morning? Come on. Sometimes, you know, I want to talk about I got it here from when God be to speak to Abraham and he says, "Now I know." Right? So, I want to I want to my topic this morning is now I know. We want to look at it from both angles. You know, God was here testing Abraham and he began to tell Abraham. He says after Abraham obeyed God, he said, "Now I know that you love me." Right? But before God could test Abraham for this final test somewhere I believe that Abraham had already had to come to a crossover point right to where he knew who God was. How many believe that this morning? So I said now I know. Do you know this morning? Come on. Have you cross came to that crossover point this morning? Because that's where the blessings is. How many believe that? Come on. So we find that I says you know uh here in the scriptures you know uh uh uh we see the the what happened here and how God you know a little background of it how you know Abraham had waited so long for the promise that God made him right but in the middle of waiting on the promise something happened right in the middle of waiting on on God to fulfill his promise to him he has some some trials and he has some other test that he had to go through. But what they were just the the other they were tests and sometimes we go through a lot of tests, a lot of trials and we think that you know uh well that might be enough but no God might got something else to put you to the final test. Amen. But nevertheless, all these all the other things, right, are just I believe strengthening your faith, right, to where you come to a place to where you can trust God in all things. &gt;&gt; Come on. The Bible says that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God, did he? Through unbelief, but was what? Strong in faith. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Giving glory to God. So it's somewhere along the line as as Abraham, you know, and who he was, but somewhere along the line before uh he got to this point, right? He had to have, you know, went through. Hallelujah. Right? But we know that he was the father of faith, right? Not only father of faith, but one of the key things he had was patience, right? Because you can have say, "I got faith." But you got to have patience sometime because God may not come right when you think he ought to come. Right. Right. It says, "But he always comes on time." But it's one thing about it. When you got patience with your faith, right? Is nothing can move you. How many believe that? Come on. You You'll be like a tree, I believe, planted by the rivers of water, right? Come on. That nothing won't be able to shake you. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; And that's what it is. That's why we always a lot of times thank God for the struggles and the things that we've gone through because what that does that made you who you are today. You know, I was sharing with uh some of the guys the other night at work. I was just telling my testimony of where God brought me from. Right. &gt;&gt; And one of the guys uh supervisors, he stood up cuz he was a little bit stirred. He said, "Ernest, whatever you do, don't quit telling your testimony." He said, "Cuz somebody need to hear it." And I began to say to him, I says, "Yeah, that might have been a little while ago now." I says, "But even though it's been a little while, time ain't did nothing to the testimony. &gt;&gt; It's still fresh today." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every time I think about the goodness of Jesus and where God brought me from, what shape that I was in, and how can I not uh uh be stirred to tell somebody, hallelujah, that if he done it for me, that he can do it for you. &gt;&gt; I began to share with them the other night. I said, "Sometimes you might look at, you know, where people are in life, right? You might look at the the the decisions that they can make sometimes when they when they're under fire, right? Or when they're under pressure, you can see them still standing firm and not have a worry about it, right? I says, but they didn't get there overnight, did they? &gt;&gt; Come on. But it was something that built them up to that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was some storms and some other trials, some other things that built them up to get to that. So when they stand and they speaking to you, they acting not by what they heard or what they seen from others, but they they doing it by experience. &gt;&gt; Come on. I heard I seen but now I know. Hallelujah. That he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh Jesus. Come on. God wants somebody to know this morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. But what happens many of times, come on. He puts us through the test and and we fall in the test, right? And like let's like Abraham Herod the whole test you know he waited a long time to get it didn't he come on &gt;&gt; all those years he did all the obedience to obey God and then when the blessing finally came right &gt;&gt; I can see him enjoying himself shouting praising God right &gt;&gt; but now all of a sudden one day God asked him you know that blessing I gave you I want you to give it back hallelujah come on God will try you with it, won't he? &gt;&gt; But it's one thing about him. Come on. He knew that God gave it to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was a miracle and him getting it from the beginning. &gt;&gt; And if he worked a miracle then, he can work a miracle then. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's the truth, ain't it? &gt;&gt; God is still working miracles, ain't it? &gt;&gt; I received him as one from the dead, right? God is able to raise him back up. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But many of times, come on, people get what God promised them, right? And they forget all about God, don't they? &gt;&gt; They love it more than than the God that gave it to them. &gt;&gt; Serve the creature more than the creator, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. But I says, Lord, no matter how you bless me, how you lift me up, how much you do for me in my life, I don't ever want to forget who brought me. I don't ever want to forget who saved me. &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to forget who visited me in those dark nights. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's real though, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. But I says that you know what it is. Abraham somewhere along the line, like I said, he got to that crossover point. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Come on. I was hearing a a a girl say she made a statement about about uh you know she didn't really uh have religion wasn't a religious person didn't really believe in God right but she says many people they they believe in God because they had some some trial or some crisis come and that caused them to look to God and and then that's he he he worked it out for them and then they started serving them and that may be true Right? Because if you belong to God, God going to do whatever he got to do to get you. &gt;&gt; Come on. But she made a statement. She said, "I hadn't had that happen in my life yet. But if something like that happens in my life, then maybe I'll I'll turn to him then. But I I began to say within myself when I was thinking about that, it don't work like that." &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; While while you are here today, the day you hear his voice, &gt;&gt; right? Harden not your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. As they did in the day of provocation because when that crisis come, &gt;&gt; you might not have a chance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When that dark night come, come on. And that's the truth, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I say, give God all you got. Amen. You know, I I was praying the other week and you know, I was thinking about that song. One of the sisters, Sister Irene, used to sing, you better give God all you got. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I began to just moan and and sing that a little bit in my prayer. You got to give God all you got. God want people that's going to give them all they got. Right? &gt;&gt; Remember, he owns every cattle on the hill. One thing about it, why I can give God everything? Because I know that he he's great. He He's got every own everything, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. He's able to do exceeding abundantly above what? &gt;&gt; Oh, you can ask a thing. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing you reaching for, don't you know that's at the disposal of God? &gt;&gt; Come on. That's the truth this morning, ain't it? Hallelujah. But we find that like I say, uh Abraham, come on. He had somewhere along the line. How many agree with that this morning? &gt;&gt; That he got to a crossover point, didn't he? Come on. Even though I I says many of times, you know, uh we find that that people come on. They they they haven't got to that point yet. Right? So God shows you and I that, don't we? Don't he? Many people in their heart, they say, "I'll follow God. I'll go with him all the way." Come on. But when those dark nights come, which they coming, how many believe that? But when they come, where is your faith? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I believe that Peter said, "Lord, if all forsake you, I won't." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. And Peter made that statement. I believe after it was already revealed to him that Jesus was the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When nobody else could see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Peter saw it, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Jesus told him a flesh and blood hadn't revealed this to you, right? &gt;&gt; But it's my father that's in heaven. You couldn't see it on your own, but God had to open your eyes. &gt;&gt; Many times you want to see it. You want, but God's got to open your eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God opened my eyes. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that God brought me out. Come on. If it had not been for Jesus, where would I be? Come on. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Come on. But he thought he thought that, didn't he? But then he began to He said, "I'll never I'll never." But when that dark night came, come on. In the midnight hour, what did he do? Come on. He He swore. He cursed. He denied that he even knew Jesus. Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of all the things that God uh worked among you, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. When the when the ship was tossed and about to sink one or not, come on. Wind blowing hard. Here come Jesus walking out on the water. &gt;&gt; That's the man that you denied that you even knew. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in your dark night, come on. When you was crying out for fear, you didn't deny him then, did you? You said, "Lord, if it's you, I know the wind and the storm, everything looking drastic. But if it's you in this storm, bid me come." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus bid him, didn't he? He got out the boat and began walking, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; But we know the story of what happened when he began to look around. He got his eyes off of him, right? But remember that's the man that he denied, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, so many testimonies he had, right? &gt;&gt; So many miracles that God had already worked, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. In his heart, he wanted to stay, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He wanted to fight. He wanted to be there with him to the end. But Jesus knew it was going to take more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Than what he had, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. It was going to take a Pentecost experience. &gt;&gt; It was going to take the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. Like they say, I can't live right till you send it on down. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. What I say is that what that's what it took. Come on. Before he come to that crossover point, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But either way, no matter what it takes, you got to come to that, don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Trials, test, you got to come to that. But when he came to that place, right, he can be able to stand up. Maybe somebody could identify him that it wasn't long ago. You told us you didn't know him. Now you out here preaching in his name. Come on. &gt;&gt; Few days ago, you say you didn't want nothing to do with him, but now you out here telling everybody how he died for their sins. &gt;&gt; Come on. Why? Because something new had happened in his life, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. I got faith to stand now, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't have faith then, but I got it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought I knew then, but I know now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I knew now. Right. &gt;&gt; I thought I did, but now I know. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's living inside of me. &gt;&gt; And what's inside of me won't let me deny. &gt;&gt; Won't let me not stop praising them. Won't let me not tell somebody about the goodness of Jesus. Hallelujah. I can't help but to testify. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. Is it burning in your heart like that? &gt;&gt; Come on. I don't know about you, but it's burning in my heart that way. &gt;&gt; Come on. But what it is, come on. God loves us so much, don't he? I says, "And what it is, you know, uh uh you know, all these tests and trials, like we said, he says, now I know. I believe that like we said Abraham, you built up to that point and just as you and I building, right? Come on. God is God is taking us somewhere, ain't he? But what you got to do, as I was sharing with the church last Sunday, I says, sometimes you got to remind yourself of those dark nights. &gt;&gt; Come on. Sometimes you got to remind yourself, come on, of past trials. And don't dwell on the pain now. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ain't talking about dwelling on the pain. We talking about reminding yourself of those times and the victory that God wrought in your life. &gt;&gt; Reminding yourself &gt;&gt; of that night you stayed up all night. &gt;&gt; Didn't know what the outcome was going to be. &gt;&gt; But God, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you woke up, oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; his mercies were new. every day. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to remind yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm in my present storm, but I'm going to remind myself. &gt;&gt; Come on. Like the sister was singing, you got to encourage yourself. Nobody else ain't going to encourage you sometime. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They might discourage you, but you got to encourage what? Yourself. &gt;&gt; You got to stir yourself up in God sometime. Lord, I know what everybody's saying. I know what everybody else is doing. But God, I'm reminded what you did for me. &gt;&gt; I'm reminded what you promised me. I'm reminded how you brought me. &gt;&gt; It wasn't by no ideology or trickery. But God, you came in my life and you shook me up one day. &gt;&gt; I'm reminded. &gt;&gt; And I don't believe you brought me this far to leave me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. How many believe that this morning? But you got to stir herself up, right? &gt;&gt; Remind yourself. Don't revisit it because of the pain now, &gt;&gt; but revisit it because of how you shouldn't have made it out, but God gave you victory over it. &gt;&gt; Come on. You thought about little David. Hallelujah. And how he had to reminding himself like the guy was telling me the other night, don't quit telling your testimony, I can't, right? I can't. Come on. because it was the power of God in that &gt;&gt; and he's still doing stuff right now, ain't he? But I believe that like I say, you got to remind yourself. I believe David was reminding himself, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; When Goliath stood out that that there that day, right? When nobody else could reach back. Hallelujah. But David had some dark nights he could reach back to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He had come to a crossover point, hadn't he? When Saul hadn't, hallelujah, when all the great warriors hadn't, but this young boy had come to a crossover point, he didn't look at Goliath for who he was, but he looked at him, hallelujah, as a promise that God made that thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. I ain't looking at how tall he is, how much he can fight. Come on. It don't matter. He ain't nothing but a devil. Come on. And God is still casting out devils. &gt;&gt; He's still defeating devils. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. But he's stir himself up, right? He got there in front of Saul and those didn't look like much. But what he was doing, he was testifying, wasn't he? &gt;&gt; He says, "Uh, come on. Don't you know who we serve?" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you know? Well, let me tell you if you don't know because now I know. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. I was back there sheep one day. &gt;&gt; Come on. And a lion came. See, he was revisiting those dark nights, &gt;&gt; wasn't he? Oh, Jesus. Grabbed him. Would have killed the little lamb, right? But something rose up. Come on. Maybe he said, "I thought without acting." Come on. Oh, Jesus. But before you know it, he had killed that lion, didn't he? Oh, Jesus. a barricade and same thing. Come on. And I'm convinced that if God brought me through that, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; then he'll bring me through this. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced if he's God on them in the wilderness, &gt;&gt; if he's God on the back side of the mountain, &gt;&gt; he's God right here, right now. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, somebody ought to get stirred this morning. Oh, how many believe that God is still the same yesterday, today, and forever? He did it once, he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Come on. But he revisited those nights, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I can see him walking. I was stirred. I said, I can see him walking. Come on. Up the up to Goliath. The Bible said he stopped by the brook and grabbed five smooth stones, didn't he? Come on. But I can see him walking just quoting to himself, "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want." Hallelujah. It worked in the wilderness, in the back of that mountain. It'll work now. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. The Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. Is he the strength of your life this morning? &gt;&gt; Then whom shall you be afraid of? &gt;&gt; Come on. Remind yourself. God, you are my strength then. I need you to be my strength now. &gt;&gt; Come on. I ain't trusting in my own ability, in my own self. God, I needed you then. I still need you now. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. Even now I need you. How many do believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. But he had walked right revisiting those dark nights. Like I said, David was testifying but not revisiting but because of any pain but revisiting the victories. Come on. Oh Jesus. The odds were against me but the victory that God brought. And I'm convinced now. God, you don't have to do nothing else. You already done enough. I'm convinced right now. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Because of the victories that you brought in my life. I'm convinced right now because of how you heal my body. I'm convinced right now. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because of how you picked me up out of the muck and the miracle. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Now I know. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. &gt;&gt; Do you feel that way this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's a crossover, ain't it? Like I says, you don't you sometimes people look, but you don't get that way overnight, do you? Come on. But it's some things that that that God I believe he brings us through, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. But I says that, you know, in those those hours, like I says, the test is coming, ain't it? Come on. And sometimes it looks like one test after another, don't it? One trial after another. Come on. But your eyes got to be single. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Come on. To know that it started with God, it's going to end with him. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. He won't let your foot slip. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that. Come on. &gt;&gt; But what God does, like we says in Abraham, it was just a test. Now, God already knew what Abraham was going to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. By him being God, right? But he wanted to show not only him but the whole world, right? To the extent that if if you obey my voice, right? Come on. That if you trust me, come on. Like I said, the man that that trusted God, he said in blessing, I'll bless you. Sometimes you want a blessing. You try to bless yourself. That ain't a blessing that come from God. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; God know how to open doors and make ways. the where it wasn't even supposed to happen that way. &gt;&gt; But when God got in it, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. When the master took over. &gt;&gt; You say, "How'd that happen?" Because God took over. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Jesus stepped in. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that he stepped in. &gt;&gt; Because if he hadn't, I don't know where I'd be at. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Somebody give the Lord praise this morning. Come on. God is good, ain't he? Come on. I says that what it is. Let's look at Hebrews 3 by the grace of God. Y'all feel all right this morning? Come on. I said the crossover. Amen. Hebrews 3. Let's look at Hebrews 11. Hebrew Hebrews 11. By the grace of God. Come on. You got to have that crossover point. I don't know about you, but I I I've come there this morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. that no matter what comes my way, let it say my life is in his hands. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Hebrews 11 and we'll begin at the the 19th verse. having trouble with this Bible in the pages. Hebrews 11:19. Y'all feel all right this morning? &gt;&gt; And it reads, "And God accounting that God was able to raise him up." Talking about Abraham now in his trials. God was able to raise him up from the even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure. By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning these things to come. By faith, Jacob when he he was dying blessed both his both his sons and worship. I I think I need Hebrews 3. Hebrews 3. Hebrews 3. So we so we see then let's go up to the 16th verse. Hebrews 3:16 says, "For some when they had heard did provoke, how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses by but with him who was he grieved 40 years? Was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcass fell in the wilderness, and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believe not." So then, so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. Come on. I says what it is. Like I said, we talking about now I know in the crossover, right? Come on. Somewhere along the line, you know, it says God taking you through all that. But you must you've got to come as to some point to a crossover point. Right. &gt;&gt; Now, what we're seeing here is a people that no matter what all God did for them, come on, they still never came to that crossover point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. A people that when they were in bondage for all these years, right? Come on. You know, people don't appreciate sometime what God do for them. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They say, "God, we know you did this, but we need you to do something else." Come on. I want to ask you this morning, what more does he have to do? &gt;&gt; Come on. He done come and died, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He done laid the foundation. He done opened up the way for your heal and he was whipped. &gt;&gt; Come on. He went through a lot. What more do we got to take him through? &gt;&gt; Come on. But sometimes people don't people don't appreciate what God is doing for them. &gt;&gt; Say, God, you did this. I know, but Lord, I I know, but I need you to do something else. But God is faithful sometimes &gt;&gt; because he loves you, right? &gt;&gt; And he wants to draw you &gt;&gt; into the nest. What did I say? &gt;&gt; Sometimes. &gt;&gt; Sometimes. Y'all catch me. Come on. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hear everybody laughing at me. Come on. But God is good, ain't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. I said he want to bring you in the nest, don't he? &gt;&gt; But what it is, he wants you. That's why he say keep doing things because he loves you. You know, God goes to so many extent such extents sometime to get his people to love him. &gt;&gt; Come on. You think about even after he died and he rose and he began to show himself to people, he even told the disciples before that happened that this would happen, right? And everything came just like what he said. But even after that, they still didn't believe, right? &gt;&gt; The Bible says that they believed not. But all of a sudden, he come walking through the door. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That looked like that should have been enough. Right? &gt;&gt; But yet, you still have some that didn't believe. He said, "Give me bread. Give me fish." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I want to show you. I want you to believe me. I want you to trust me. &gt;&gt; That when I tell you something, &gt;&gt; come on. That it'll be just like I said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Have I failed you yet? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. God hadn't failed. How has he? Come on. Have I never not come through? &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm trying to get you to believe me. What else you want me to do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe Thomas said, "I I still won't believe unless I I touch the hand and in your side." Right? &gt;&gt; But he said, "Come on then." Right? I want you to believe me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to see that I do what I said. &gt;&gt; Come on. I want you to trust me. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said I trust God this morning. &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, you don't have to do nothing else. Hallelujah. Bringing me out of the muck into my clay was impossible sometimes. It looked like by itself. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. You know, one thing I I was I was stirred about the other day. I was reading how David was saying he was saying I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to dwell in the tents of the wicked. Come on. And I began to think about that. It it's it's greater in the house of God. Hallelujah. And in his presence &gt;&gt; any day, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. I I It's better I'll be a doorkeeper. &gt;&gt; Come on. And I'll be content with that. God, I just want to be where you are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. I just want to be in your presence, under your covering. Is that what you want this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. But we find that like I says, sometimes no matter what God does, that's how people reaction is. But but he did what he said, didn't he? Come on. He did it. He told him after 400 years, right? I'm coming, right? And he came just like he said, didn't he? And when he came, it seemed to be unbelievable, right? Seen to be impossible. But God works in the impossible. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because all things are possible with him. &gt;&gt; But he begin to work in what looked like it was nothing. Right? &gt;&gt; And he begin to use that what looked like it wasn't nothing. &gt;&gt; But all of that was for the people to give God glory after it was over with. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. that they'll be able to look at that trial and know the only way I made it through it was because what God did. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's why God done it that way. &gt;&gt; Right. I believe it was Gideon Gideon or those he told it when he was going to fight. He said, "You got too many. I don't want nobody else to get no glory." &gt;&gt; Come on. Paraphrasing it, right? Come on. But all he does that for, he works in the impossible. He works with the the small. He works in the things. Come on. I share with people all the time. I says when it looks like all the doors are shut, when it looks like there's no way possible, that's just when God begins to work. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what you got to do, you got to turn your faith loose. &gt;&gt; Because all of your other resources are exhausted. &gt;&gt; Come on. All your friends are gone. Everybody that will encourage you ain't there no more. That's where God begins to work right in that place. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. But he brought he he came, like I said, he did that. He worked miracles and signs and wonders right in Egypt. Brought them out. But one of the things, like I said, the whole time they were brought out, they had a problem with crossing over, right? Come on. whole time they were brought out from the very beginning at the Red Sea. What they say, "We told you you should have left us in Egypt. You brought us out here to die." Come on. But God heard him say that, didn't he? But God begin to show I like how God spoke through Moses. And Moses says, he says, "Fear ye not." Right? Come on. But stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. But this day, he said, "God going to fight for you." &gt;&gt; And the Egyptians, come on. &gt;&gt; That hurt you, that gave you pain all those years. &gt;&gt; Come on. The ones that had you bound after the day. Hallelujah. You won't have to worry about him no more. &gt;&gt; Come on. The Lord going to fight for you. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. After the day now. Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; That should have been a crossover. &gt;&gt; Come on. God. He said, "I'll fight for you." Come on. Oh, Jesus. But still yet, that was a crossover for them, was it? Come on. Right. Look like on the red after the Red Sea and they dancing with the tambourines. Come on. The women singing. Come on. Look like then they would have said, "Now I know, right?" They didn't know, did they? Come on. They danced in, but another storm was coming, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. They danced in, but another test was right around the corner, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. And test after test, come on. God proved himself to be worthy. &gt;&gt; Test after test, God proved himself to be still alive and well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Trial after trial, God showed up, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. But yet they still couldn't muster within themselves to come to a crossover point. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. Good day. I said, "What else they got to do?" Come on. They get all the way to the land and what they go over and even to the description of what God told Moses the land would be back like, right? &gt;&gt; They went over in the land and they came back with the evidence of the description. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. They came back with the fruits of it, right? And they themselves testify that it's just like what God said it to be. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's just as good as God said it was, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. But their eyes messed them up. &gt;&gt; Didn't it? Because by then they hadn't learned faith yet. Come on. By then they had learned to stop looking at what your eyes see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had learned then to stop hearing what your ears hear. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because if it's going against what God word say, &gt;&gt; let every man be a lie, let God word be true. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it comes to that crossover, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never got there. who when they got there, they says, "Oh, we can't go in. They're giants. We grasshoppers in our in our in our own sight." Come on. But God here, he says, "Since they murmur, they complain." Come on. Oh, Jesus. They wanted, I provided for them. They were sick, I healed them. &gt;&gt; When the enemy came, I fought for them. &gt;&gt; Come on. I did all that I could do, and yet they still don't believe me. Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yet they still won't trust me like their forefathers did. Hallelujah. Come on. But it was two out of the bunch. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. But the Bible says that they had another spirit, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Come on. They weren't the same as everybody else in church. They were a little bit different. Hallelujah. They had Hallelujah. Come on. I said, "What it is?" Everybody ain't the same. &gt;&gt; Come on. When the dark night come, it'll show you that. &gt;&gt; Come on. When trials and tribulations come, it'll show you that. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. I was praying. I said, "Lord, but when all my strength is gone, let me find my strength in you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What it is, we look for the Holy Ghost to rise up. &gt;&gt; Come on. We look for the guide to take over. Come on. Because without him, you ain't going to find your way. &gt;&gt; But in those times, that's when the guide take over. That's when he begins to order your footsteps. You don't know the direction you're going in. But you just keep walking. Hallelujah. You just keep pressing because now I know. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; But we find that like we said, two of them had a different spirit, didn't they? Come on. But what do they say? It says we are more than able. &gt;&gt; Come on. How' they How' they come to that conclusion? Come on. Somewhere somewhere they came to a crossover point. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Somewhere. Come on. They came to that place. He already done enough. Come on. I know what is in the land. But what's in the land can't defeat the promise that God made us. &gt;&gt; Amen. The promise that God made us is greater than all the trials that's standing before us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What God did is greater than anything that could come upon us. &gt;&gt; So I know not only are we able, but we're more than able. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're more than conquerors through Christ that loves us and gives us what? Strength. How many believe that this morning? Somebody give God praise this morning? Come on. I say it's what it is. You know, you you find that like I said that you come to that you come to that place. You got to come to that place. &gt;&gt; Come on. That crossover life will change then. Come on. &gt;&gt; Things will change because then you'll know. Come on. Like we said, now I know. Then you'll know, right? &gt;&gt; That the God you serve, right? It's no test or trial that come on your life that he didn't already know about. They hit you hard sometime come and they might come like go knock you out because you wasn't really aware of it. But when you get down on your knees and you begin talking to the one that brought you and you said, "Lord, I knew you knew this day before it even came &gt;&gt; and I didn't see it coming. Neither did you tell me. But Lord, what I'mma do right now, I'mma wait on you." &gt;&gt; Come on. Because I know what you told me. Hallelujah. I wrestled long enough &gt;&gt; and I know that you'll make a way for me somehow. &gt;&gt; And while I'm down here on my knees, &gt;&gt; come on. All those that are around me, give them faith to believe God. &gt;&gt; Come on. And if they can't muster faith to believe, when you get done, let them see that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If you can use anything, Lord, use me. &gt;&gt; It's trial. If if it's for somebody else, help me to bear it. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. Don't you know sometimes God's sending you through so he might show the world through you that he's the same yesterday, today, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Come on. That he can show the world through you, that if you trust me, if you live for me, if you believe in me, hallelujah, then I'll do for you what I did for them. &gt;&gt; Come on, you got to believe that this morning. Somebody believe that this morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. God is good, ain't he? &gt;&gt; You know, one of the one thing I I was close with this one thing I says, you know, come to that crossover. It's something about, you know, I've been doing a lot of witnessing and stuff lately. And I was, like I sharing with one guy, I says, you need a gospel that's going to change you. Come on. You It can't just be intellectual knowledge. That's why you can't live right, you know? That's why you having these struggles. Come on. But you need something that's going to change you. Come on. I begin to say how often used to pray when the Lord saved me. I begin I often pray, Lord, I need you to do something. I need a double dip. I need to be filled up to the top. Let my cup run over because I said, "Lord, I'm afraid of myself. I don't know what I'm capable of. So God, I need you to come in. And I know when you come in and you sit on the throne of my heart, it'll be over with then. all of my struggles, all the temptations, the battle, all that will be over with then. So, I had to stay down on my knees long enough. Come on. But sometimes people don't never go there, right? They just satisfied with coming out. Come on. But that's what it says. Just like the children of Israel, they never came to that crossover point. But when you come to that crossover, hallelujah, that's where he wants you to get at, right? Then, uh, things will change. Like I say, you need a gospel that'll change you, right? One of my one of my friends, he he Muslim by faith, and he was saying, "You Christians," he was saying, "All y'all Christians." He said, "Y'all y'all only uh uh read or live by whatever y'all, you know, what's um applicable, not applicable, but whatever you want to pick and choose out of, you know." I said, "No real Christian to do that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, he said, "All I" I said, "No real Christian." I said, "But a real Christian, he ain't going to live by bread alone, but by every word." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; A real Christian in his heart, his desire is going to be to be pleasing to God in in all his ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all that he got, what he wanted to do is is give it back to God, a real Christian, right? &gt;&gt; But I began to share him with that. I says, "That's not that's not so." But you know, some things was talking about and it was another guy with us and we was talking. And I says, you know, one thing about it, I says that a lot of people, they they they profess God with their mouths, but their heart ain't in it. Come on. I said, well, well, did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying they honor me with their mouths, but yet their heart is far from me. There's a lot of people like that, ain't it? But what it is, you got somebody that's like David that want to deal, I want you to deal with my heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "Create in me a clean heart and renew the right spirit in me. Search me, oh God." Come on. Search my heart. Try my See, David wanted to deal with the heart, right? Not just with my intellectual. Now, God, I want you to deal with my heart. Come on. Cuz where a man heart is, that's where his treasure will be at &gt;&gt; every single time. That's the Bible. Come on. And it's true. That's why I said, "God, let my heart be in you. Let my heart get in the word and stay there. Come on. Let it be covered. Let it be washed. Come on. Oh, by the water of your word. That's what I want. Come on. And that's why I can't help but to live the way I live. Act the way I do the things I do. Why? Because God has come to heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You can't help but when you get up in the morning to praise him. You can't help but when you lay down at night to praise God because he's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come with me. God is in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Believe me, God is in my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. And I want you to stay there, God, throughout all times. Is that what you want this morning? Somebody give God praise this morning. Oh Jesus. He said, "Now I know." Come on. I said, "Have you come to that crossover this morning?" Come on. And if you hadn't, you can do that this morning. Come on. what it is. God wants to make you new again. &gt;&gt; He wants to change your life, but you got to allow him to come in. Come on. Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Come on. His mercies, oh God, are everlasting. His truth enduring, but you got to let them in. Let us bow our heads this morning. Oh Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you Jesus for your grace this morning. Thank you for your mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; now I know. &gt;&gt; Come on, you got to reach that crossover this morning. That place to where you say, "God, you did enough. Now I can testify. I got trials, dark nights I can reach back to. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; I got testimonies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of how God brought me out. &gt;&gt; And if he did it then, he'll do it now. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Help somebody this morning. God loves you with all he has. He loves you. Come on. He don't want to hurt you, but he just wants you to trust. Sometimes he he does all he can do for people to get them to trust him. What more does he have to do this morning? What more? Oh Jesus, I say this morning, God, you already done enough.

Has he been good to you? &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, has he made a way for you? Then why don't you worship God? Why don't you tell him thank you? Why don't you testify about the goodness of Jesus? Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. As our brother sings this morning, if you want prayer, you can come this morning. If you want to give your life to the Lord, you can come this morning.

I like that little that little verse. But he say, "I sought the Lord and he heard and he answered." I'm so glad that he answered. I'm so glad he not just heard, but he answered. You know, it may come a day you'll call, somebody will call and he won't answer. He'll hear, but he won't answer. Or you'll call and he won't hear. But I sought the Lord and he called and and he heard and he answered. Come on. That's why I trust. Love him. Trust him. Right. That's why. Come on. How many believe that this morning?
