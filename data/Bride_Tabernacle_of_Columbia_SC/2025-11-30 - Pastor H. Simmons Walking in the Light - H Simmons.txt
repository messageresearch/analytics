Amen. &gt;&gt; Appreciate the Lord God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We Amen. I I was kind of stirred this morning in Sunday school this morning. I trust that we recognize who we are and what we come here this short space in time to go back to eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Eternity has no beginning and no end. &gt;&gt; And eternal life means you have no beginning and [music] no end. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So God is eternal. And God is Elohim. He's a self-existent one. [music] And God is the object of worship because God we created the angels and he created you and I in his image and in his likeness. So we're here serving time [music] to go back to eternity. So by the grace of God, what God had in his mind, what God thought were all about, God had redemption plan, a plan of redemption in God was to be savior. He was in God was to be healer. He had attributes. If there was nothing lost, then there was nothing to be saved. So by the grace of God, God in his infinite mercy and grace, he allowed certain events to happen to work all things to his good. At the end, the devil won't win. The devil is still a loser. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So no matter what struggles and what battles you go through, God has already given us the victory. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Let us stand this morning for the reading of the word. We certainly appreciate the songs of worship. Let us bow our heads and you have a special need, you can lift your hand to the Lord and say, "Lord, I have a need." Certainly, there are many that on the prayer list this morning. [music] Some are going through bereavement and some are going through laying on the bed of affliction. So looking at my niece and seeing her struggle. So as we look at Madonna this morning, different ones, oh God, &gt;&gt; Brother Arthur Lee Paige and Sister Paige, Lord, we think that life is here. But for a moment and in any time, Lord, [music] we can be lying down on the bed of affliction. But God, you able. Touch our brother Arthur Lee, &gt;&gt; Sister Paige today. touch or Donna and Jocelyn and all of those on the prayer list today. Lord, these hands that have been lifted and they have needs this morning, &gt;&gt; you promise in your word. But my God &gt;&gt; shall supply all of our needs &gt;&gt; according to his riches in glory. God, I know you have not run [screaming] out of mercy. &gt;&gt; Mercy and grace is still available. &gt;&gt; So we look to you now. &gt;&gt; Will you touch, heal, and deliver, &gt;&gt; save, and set free &gt;&gt; filled with your spirit Lord &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; For we thank you this morning for the blessing of your word. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; As we stand this morning, uh, First John the 2 chapter, [snorts] I mean First John the first chapter, excuse me. I'll read the first, you read the next, and we'll read the latter verse together. First John, the first chapter. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, too. For the lightest we [snorts] have seen ital us. &gt;&gt; That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his son Jesus Christ. Four &gt;&gt; and these things rightly unto you that your joy may be full. &gt;&gt; This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. Six. &gt;&gt; If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and not truth. But if we walk in the light as he's in the light, we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin. Eight. &gt;&gt; If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. &gt;&gt; If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. together. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Reading word. You may be seated. The message comes from verse seven. If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses us from all sin. &gt;&gt; We want to use forth walking in the light. walking uh I was ministering down to Mullins the other Sunday and we were talking about walking in the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; So walking in the light. Now we know the light is that which makes vision possible. And the song is in Psalms 119 and 105. Psalms 119 and 105 began to tell us that Amen. that God, he said, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a light, &gt;&gt; unto my path. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walking in the light. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, "The entrance of thy word giveth light." &gt;&gt; And let us go to St. John 1. St. John 1. It's I think people have lost the vision. They think if I come to church then I'm all right. I'm in the light. They think that if I do this or I do that, then I'm in the light. Light is that which makes vision possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man that is blind cannot see. &gt;&gt; You know, if it was dark outside and we turned off all the lights, it might be that you can have eyes, but you won't be able to distinguish or be able if it was totally dark in here, you couldn't see who's in the room. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Though you have eyes, Amen. Yet because of the darkness, it'll blind you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ever got up in the night and the lights was off and you stumbled over something that was in the floor? &gt;&gt; Amen. Had nothing to do with your eyes. &gt;&gt; It was It had everything to do with the darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, walking in the light. Amen. Having the understanding that Jesus said, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And without him was not anything made that wasn't made. &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; In him was life, and the life walking in the light, and the life was the what? &gt;&gt; The life was the light of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question. Are you shining? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you shining? &gt;&gt; Because the Bible tells us that ye are the lights of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; A city that sets on a hill that cannot be healed. &gt;&gt; So he says to us to let &gt;&gt; let your light shine. &gt;&gt; Let what? &gt;&gt; Shine. &gt;&gt; Let your [screaming] light shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the light was the light of men. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; To let it shine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you letting your light shine? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you [screaming] walking in the light? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To walk in the light is to allow and to let your light shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know we're living in a in a in the evening time. And in the evening time, God said there shall be light. &gt;&gt; Amen. The light causes us to see what God will have us to know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Caleb like to sing the song that there shall be light in the evening time. The path to glory you shall surely find. It's a waterway. It's a light today. Baptized in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you haven't been baptized in Jesus' name, then perhaps, Amen, you're still walking in darkness. But we want you to Amen. to walk in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you Amen. If you know some folks if they're bl uh if they've been blind all their life, then they're accustomed to darkness. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And they know how to maneuver uh uh themselves in darkness because they have been blind all their life. if they learn how to live in darkness. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But if they knew that, Amen. It's possibility that I don't have to be blind. &gt;&gt; And that's why the song says, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. The same arct like me." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "I was blind, but &gt;&gt; Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God for the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That brought [screaming] life and immortality to the light by the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad for the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Because [screaming] of light, I can see. &gt;&gt; At one time, I was in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. I couldn't see. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Folks with eyes and of understanding will try to tell me about amen. Things that because of darkness and because of being blind don't they can tell me about what they see but I couldn't see it because I [screaming] was blind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were born blind. That's why Jesus said, "Except a man is born again, he cannot understand. He cannot see the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, Amen. our understanding must be enlightened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He must open up our understanding. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; On the road to Em. Amen. Jesus began to rebuke them fool and slowing heart. Uh, ought not you to believe those things uh which the prophets and the psalms spoke of that thus it is written in dust behooves Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin shall be preached in his name &gt;&gt; beginning at Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And he opened their understanding that they might what? Understand the scripture." &gt;&gt; God wants you to understand what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [screaming] You know, Amen. You would have excused. Amen. So, I don't understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Paul says he gave him a gospel that cause all men to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. The gospel is to open your eyes. Jesus said, "If I've not come, they would have had a cloak for the sin. Because I've come, you have no clue." &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus talked to Nicodemus, except a man be born again. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus could not understand, [screaming] could not comprehend. How can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born? But Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man is [screaming] born of water in a spirit, he cannot what? &gt;&gt; See?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you believe you sin, how much you think you sin, without [screaming] being born again, you cannot see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can feel like you understand. &gt;&gt; You can think that you understand. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it takes [screaming] a born again experience &gt;&gt; for you to really see and understand the things of God. &gt;&gt; I got to pick back up here. The light was in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in what? &gt;&gt; The light shining in darkness. This is the dark world. &gt;&gt; Demon powers are everywhere. &gt;&gt; I was We usually get up something to six, the alarm go off and the alarm go off and the news come on. That's the alarm. The news in the morning and the radio. But just before it came on, I heard a voice says and they asked me a question. Somebody asked me a question. Can a person cast a spell on you? And I was explaining, you know, and then what happened? That's not normal cuz usually the news come on. And when the radio came on, I said, "Huh?" It says the question was to the witch that was on it, "Can anybody cast a spell on you? M I said, "Huh?" And I told my wife, "You know what just happened to me? Somebody asked me the question, can [clears throat] anybody cast a spell on you?" And the witch was explaining how people can cast a spell on you. I said, "Oh Lord." You know, in other words, if you don't have no protection, &gt;&gt; bless. &gt;&gt; She was talking about some sage and stuff. [laughter] I said, "Got to get this stuff out of my room." Some sage and some stuff and and I'll tell you how to work to keep them. I said, "You ain't going to tell me how to work." You see people are are terrorized and afraid. &gt;&gt; I met a young man at at Firestone one day and we sat down and I talking to him, young white fellow probably about 19 to 20.
