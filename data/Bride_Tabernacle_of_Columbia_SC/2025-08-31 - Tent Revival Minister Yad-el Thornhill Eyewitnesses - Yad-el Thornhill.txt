[Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. God is so good to us. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. Key of C. I was just a child &gt;&gt; when I felt the Savior leading. I was drawn to what I could not understand. But for the cause of Christ, I have spent my days believing that what he have me be is who I am. As I come to see the weaker side of me, [Music] I realize his grace is what I need. When sin demanded justice for my soul, mercy said, "No, [Music] I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid." Mercy said no. [Music] Sin will never take control. Life and death stood face to face and darkness tried to steal my heart away. Thank you, Jesus. Mercy said no. For God so loved the world that he sent his son to save us. From the cross he built a bridge to set us free. war. But deep within our hearts, there is still a war that rages and it makes the sacrifice so hard to see. Oh, it's midnight fell on crucifix Sunday. The light of hope. It seemed so far away. When evil tried to stop, redemption flow. [Music] Mercy said no. Help me sing it. I'm not going to let you go. Thank you, Jesus. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. Mercy said no. Sin will never take control. [Music] Lightning stood face to face. Darkness tried to steal my heart away. [Music] Thank you Jesus. Mercy said no. [Music] Now when heaven looks at me, it's through the blood of Jesus reminding me of one day long ago. Mercy said no. I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. Hey, my go will never take control. Life and death stood face to face and darkness tried to steal my heart away. Thank you Jesus. Mercy said no. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. [Music] Mercy no [Music] [Applause] hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is good to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it will forever be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when we think about the mercies and the grace of God, &gt;&gt; God always have somebody there &gt;&gt; to help us alone. &gt;&gt; Even as Christians, we've &gt;&gt; come through hard times. But the suffering of this world cannot be compared. [Music] &gt;&gt; And it's such a wonderful thing to be able to have a companion or a friend to walk with you, &gt;&gt; talk with you and commune, &gt;&gt; rebuke you, [Music] &gt;&gt; correct you. You get all of that with friends &gt;&gt; and sometimes some surprises. But you know, it's been an honor. We're going to call our brother Nathan up. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen to the mic. It's been 50 years uh for Pastor Henry Simmons &gt;&gt; when the Lord um [Music] told me to put this tuxedo in my wardrobe. I didn't know about this. I thought I was overdoing it and I thought I had it for something else, but it wasn't the will of the Lord. And I am more than happy to do this today. But before I do it anything, I'm going to let brother Nathan go forth and tell us what brother Simmons has meant to him. &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan is a warrior, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I I love Brother Nathan. Even when we weren't saved, he used to be my boss. paper boys. &gt;&gt; Fort Jackson, &gt;&gt; I'll never forget it. &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God, who would have known we would be here together? [Music] &gt;&gt; He has been a blessing to me and I know where the inspiration comes from, God. But we know there's always somebody &gt;&gt; that we can thank God for. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to let brother Nathan go and tell whatever he needs to say. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Honored to be here among the living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, I've been knowing my brother all my life. Me and him slept in the same bed and he been a great instrument to me because I was a real sinner. &gt;&gt; Yes, you were. But I can tell you God brought me. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; My brother means so much to me. External God's focal paradox. Incredible yet is true. He been a great example as a brother, as a friend, but I didn't know the Lord. He always came by and check on me, bro. How you doing? I play sleep cuz I didn't want to hear nothing about no Lord. I just just want to have a death here. You know how it is when you really don't want to hear something. &gt;&gt; But he kept coming. He kept praying &gt;&gt; that God would save me. &gt;&gt; He been such a jump in the ministry. When I had to look around, I didn't know too many people that were saved. I know a lot of folk went to church. I know a lot of preachers preach, but I know a lot of them that live it. &gt;&gt; I had a brother and a mother I knew live it. &gt;&gt; And that was my turning point right there. You talking about one man influence on another. It was such impact in my life. People who really know me, they know that it's impossible for me to be saved. People who actually know me. But God came along at my lowest point in my darkest hour &gt;&gt; and he saved me. [Applause] [Music] I thank God for pastor Summer. I I had a lot of brothers but was none like that brother. He was an example to my mother. And somebody said, "Why do you have so much confidence?" Not so much him, the God that is in him. &gt;&gt; He cares. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I can say anything that would be I try to be an asset to him and not a liability. &gt;&gt; I try not to whatever I could do to help the ministry. I never want to be in the forefront of nothing. [Music] I like to to be behind the scene. And I thank God for my brother and for the work that God allowed him to labor for 50 years. &gt;&gt; Labor faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always had the people not money, no money. &gt;&gt; He gave me his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] No money. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; No money. He asked me for a dime. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Bro, I'm leaving Mary. I'm coming to Colombia." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God sending me to Colombia. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want him to leave cuz I depended so much on him. one day he had to go. And I thank God for these 50 years and continue to bless him, his family, his church family, you that stand with him. We thank God for y'all &gt;&gt; cuz it means so much to him. There someone that will stand strong. That's I'll stand with him. If I can sing, I'mma try. &gt;&gt; I'll stand for you, &gt;&gt; dear Jesus. Though trials [Music] may come &gt;&gt; my way. &gt;&gt; I'm ask my wife come and help me with this. [Music] You know, there's nothing like having a good wife. Lord, bless me. [Music] [Applause] The doctor gave me two days to live. I was in the hospital 6 months. I mean, 3 months. God brought me out. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] with that son. I'll stand for you, dear Jesus. You know, &gt;&gt; I'll stand for you. &gt;&gt; You Jesus. &gt;&gt; Though trials may come, &gt;&gt; I'll spread your goel to a fallen name. [Music] And if it be your will, Lord, &gt;&gt; for me to go through this trial, then have me willing Jesus to say yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus use me. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, don't refuse me. &gt;&gt; For surely there's no work that I can do. and go the way. Be humble, Lord. Help my will to crumble and the cross be great. I'll work for you. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Jesus me don't refuse me &gt;&gt; for surely a work that I can do &gt;&gt; and all this way be humble. Lord, Lord, my will to crumble. &gt;&gt; And though cross be great, I'll still work for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. Oh yeah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you never [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] have my mic. [Music] But this is from this is from you bishop by the grace of God that's out of the love of God for you and uh so want to give you this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ from bride tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. Amen. [Music] [Music] That's the Pentecost to his ministry. Amen. Pentecost in Jesus name. Amen. Praise God. We we thank thank everybody. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said I had to get the flowers to my wife. She deserve them. Amen. I especially want to thank everybody from coming and being a part of the service. It's a blessing to have every one of you and if you have visitors, we thank you for coming also. We certainly appreciate that. I want to say there's been some labels that work tremendously hard to get this tent up and do the things that he's doing. Pastor Palmer is not in Marion but he's right here with us standing firm. We go ask him to stand and minister the minister Luke Ernest ask him to stand. They work so hard. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Brother Glory. We ask him to stand. He's been the best man. Best man in my witness. Amen. You know, we don't have but a a few men, but I I appreciate the for faithful few that work so hard and seeing the young sisters out here leaving. I mean, I don't know how they got sleep. I know Rachel didn't get much at all. And I know my wife and I, we didn't get much sleep at all, but I thank God for them living faithfully. Amen. To make things possible. And uh my brother, he always uh donate big to the meetings. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then brother Jim, he don't Oh, excuse me. I got it. He don't like for nobody say nothing. He he does his part, but he like to be in the background. You don't. &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God, we thank all of you for just being faithful. And and I tell you, it takes something for someone to stand with you. And uh brother Gordon, he's he he's the main trustee and he just stands there. I put too much on him sometime. He was working. And brother Gerald there, I said, "Brother Gerald, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We appreciate you. [Music] Amen. So, we just want to thank God for uh Bishop Simmons because of the part he paid played in my life, my ministry, and &gt;&gt; what God had given unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh when it came to evangelism, he taught me everything I know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can remember the time when I Hallelujah. I first came this message. I even quit my job. &gt;&gt; And the churches in this area supported me for five years. &gt;&gt; Here I was married with babies on the way. &gt;&gt; But you know that's the way the church supposed to operate. [Music] &gt;&gt; We travel the country preaching on streets like in Michigan on what was the name of that street? Springing Max Street and while we was preaching a po a drug bus was going on and looked like that big old silver pistol was looking right at me. &gt;&gt; But we kept on preaching &gt;&gt; and then this young lady came up who was a victim of this pimp &gt;&gt; and was on drugs, but she wanted to be free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you know that man came across the street and took her out the line? &gt;&gt; The saddest thing about that, she was a preacher's daughter. &gt;&gt; You see, I want to encourage all the young girls, stay in God. &gt;&gt; And if you're going to get married, marry a saved man. [Music] You think it's bad, you think you're having a hard time being a Christian, &gt;&gt; you go out there and be a sinner. &gt;&gt; First of all, you're not going to have peace, &gt;&gt; cuz God said, "I'll never leave you, nor will I forsake you." &gt;&gt; But I'm not here to preach. I'm just here to testify. See y'all, I got caught up. &gt;&gt; But I thank God so much for him. He has been more than a friend. I I have to say this because I told the Lord I would. Brother Simmons is has had so many great opportunities elsewhere, but he loves you. &gt;&gt; Church is offering him every kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Gifted. I've seen the man I've seen God speak directly through him [Music] while we were in South Africa when we was out there in Texas. I remember he was preaching so straight it made me nervous and I thought these people are going to charge us. So me and another brother, we were looking at the back of the door trying to find a way out. But you know what happened? This was an apostolic church. They repented. &gt;&gt; All preaching, pastoring, wife, and everybody was on the altar. &gt;&gt; We preached in in in South Africa. Angels were appearing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Power of God was slaying the people. I'm just telling you what you got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe with all my heart and I might be the only one, but he's not just a a a pastor. He's an apostle. &gt;&gt; And he built without him, many of the churches in this area would not have been. &gt;&gt; But one day, I think they're going to wake up to what they the gift. &gt;&gt; And I pray that it's not too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not a compromiser. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's straight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But one thing I know, he will lead you to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the most important thing. Call yourself message, whatever you want to call you. &gt;&gt; But I understand many people who call themsel that still need to be saved. &gt;&gt; But I just thank the Lord for him in such a special special way. And maybe I I said I was telling the brothers if I ever disrespected him, it was by ignorance. No, really. Cuz he and I become such friends. Sometimes I feel like I can jump in at any time. But I don't intend to disrespect him at all. But I love the man with a great godly love. And ever what I've never seen him out of order. everywhere we went with his discernment and the things that God has gifted him with kept us straight. &gt;&gt; So I I just love and appreciate him. 50 years &gt;&gt; and he's never wavered. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; So thank you pastor. Amen. We appreciate the Lord. Amen. I'm just going to sing that one almighty God we serve. Right.

Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; As we acknowledge our savior here, &gt;&gt; thank you for your mercies. Thank you for your grace. Thank you for all you have done for us. &gt;&gt; Who the son of man has set free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; It's our God-given right to worship you &gt;&gt; to give our praises to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For you are the only one that deserve it.

Inhabit the praises of your people is our prayer. And as we come to look into your glorious word of liberty, Lord, our hearts has been prepared this morning. And may you speak to our hearts, Lord, with your word. Your word is the comfort of our hearts. And take us into where you would want us to be this morning. At the end we would see no man save Jesus and him glorified amongst us. Be exalted be lifted up. Bless the host pastor brother Simmons in a special way. His dear wife and family and the entire congregation here. Every visitor, every minister that supported. Lord, we know it's all your love and your grace &gt;&gt; expressed in this end time as we prepare for your glorious coming. Oh, dress us with your clothes of your word as we wait upon thee. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. May we all say amen this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Let's give the Lord a note of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory be to God in the highest. Would you just greet someone next to you and say, "Welcome to the house of the Lord, brother. Welcome, sister. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, while we are standing, I'll just like to take a portion of scripture reading. If we can turn in our Bibles, we'll read from Job chapter 42. Just one verse I have heard. Verse five, I have heard of thee by the hearing of the air, but now mine eye seeth thee. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading of his word. We may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many love the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; He has made us glad. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To God we give the glory. &gt;&gt; To God we give all the praise. He is the worthy one. We thank God for being with you all here today. &gt;&gt; My first time in South Carolina. And um it has certainly been a tremendous blessing to be here with you all to enjoy worshiping the Lord with you all. And uh you know, brother Simmons has been with us back in Trinidad for quite a few times together with brother Isaiah Brooks and um they have certainly been a blessing to us over in Trinidad and all the messages, all the songs and so they their names are famous in Trinidad. And um the last time brother Simmons came, I believe he came with his son, brother Caleb. and um they sang in our church and you know to see brother Caleb now bringing forth the word of God yesterday and we certainly enjoy the message and it's a tremendous blessing to see that God could raise up young men uh with the gospel to hold the sword of the word and drive it to the heart of the enemy. Brother, that's a tremendous blessing and brother I pray that you will continue supporting him and uh uh it was a pleasure to meet brother Joshua and the entire family of brother Simmons is dear wife and daughter and it's it's it was a privilege to me to see the operation in the tent and the support and the vision that brother Simmons had to reach out to the last member because we are all waiting until the last member comes in. &gt;&gt; And when the fold is full, &gt;&gt; we will leave here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The good shepherd leaves the 90 and nine and he goes out for that last one. &gt;&gt; And when the f is full, then we leave here. &gt;&gt; So we cannot leave until the last member comes in. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, so it's important for us to continue reaching out, reaching out and by that time, God will be building what he has on the inside. And we are all coming up to a statue of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Unto the fullness of the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; A people that the world never saw before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is Christ embodied in flesh. &gt;&gt; One more time. A people that the word, the letters have left the Bible and it have embodied flesh. And this is who we are here in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not just church goers, &gt;&gt; brother. We are Bible believers. &gt;&gt; We are the ones that are called to eat this book &gt;&gt; and the words here become a reality in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where we could become Christ expressed to this last generation. &gt;&gt; So it was wonderful seeing the efforts that went into it and all the different brothers and brother Gyra there a wonderful soldier supporting. Every time I see him, he's working. And may God bless him abundantly for all his labors of love. And you know, I appreciated Brother Simmons even more this time uh coming here. And when he came, I believe it was back in 2018. You know, Brother Simmons always walk with his cards and anywhere anyone he would reach, he would extend an invitation to you. And uh when he came to Trinidad, you all understand my accent? All right. It may be a bit difficult, but may God give us grace this morning. When he came to Trinidad, um he gave me one of his cards. I believe that would have been in 2018. And he told me that anytime I'm on this side, be sure to visit him. And um well, it was never God never placed it as a burning to be here. And I've visited the States a few times since then, but never here. And um recently he called me again and he told me about these meetings that they were going to have and he invited me to come and and the Lord placed it upon my heart to be here. And uh when he came the previous time in 2018 uh the Lord just placed a little thought on my heart on eyewitnesses &gt;&gt; and he said if ever you go by brother Simmons preach this. And here I am after 7 years and I believe that God has something in this little thought for us this morning. I pray it be a blessing to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are all called here in the word of God. You know Peter spoke about it that we have not followed connly devised fables. So my little thought this morning is eyewitnesses. And a an eyewitness is someone very important because uh you know you see things that sometimes you are accountable for &gt;&gt; and many times you see things that others would not see &gt;&gt; and it's important for us to understand what we are seeing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest. And almighty God has called us all to be eyewitnesses of his majesty. &gt;&gt; All right. We must understand we are supernatural beings trapped in a body of time. &gt;&gt; We believe that &gt;&gt; we are not from here. &gt;&gt; I'm from Trinidad. My brother is from Zambia. Brother Jimmy and we have some of us from America. And but we are not from here. &gt;&gt; We came from eternity. And we are going back &gt;&gt; to eternity. &gt;&gt; We are just on a journey here in time. &gt;&gt; This is the shortest period of time you will ever live is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when we enter eternity, there is no tomorrow. There's no yesterday. There's a everpresent. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a circle. It never There's never an end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We live We will live for ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the one that died for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was someone that thought of all this and this is what we know as the great redemption plan. It was a plan that God had in his mind that he could reveal himself to man one more time and take man back &gt;&gt; to the original condition to live forever with him. &gt;&gt; And he has called us to be part of that. &gt;&gt; So we are not &gt;&gt; normal Americans. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We refer to ourselves as being the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; We are called to be different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are called to see things that the world never saw before. &gt;&gt; We are a a special class of people. &gt;&gt; And you would notice God in the beginning in the garden of Eden, God gave Adam the power to create. &gt;&gt; We know Adam could have controlled the winds. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he named the animals. &gt;&gt; Brother Adam arranged the garden. God placed him to dress the garden. And Adam did not dress the garden with bulldozers and excavators. He dressed the garden with the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adam said mountain move and the mountain moved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said trees moved and the trees moved. &gt;&gt; If the wind was too hard, brother, he could say lower. He controlled the temperature in the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; We believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where we fell from. &gt;&gt; But that's where we are going back to. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; And in the garden of Eden, Adam with all that authority and power, &gt;&gt; yet God in the cool of the day &gt;&gt; would condescend &gt;&gt; and speak with Adam. Amen. &gt;&gt; What sort of a fellowship that would have been? &gt;&gt; A man that had all power. &gt;&gt; He had all authority. &gt;&gt; But yet God was above that. &gt;&gt; And God will choose the cool of the day to condescend and fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Glory. That same God wants to fellowship with us even today. &gt;&gt; It's that same God is speaking to us. What would that fellowship have been? So, what I'm saying is that God loves fellowship. &gt;&gt; God loves to reveal himself to us. &gt;&gt; God wants more of us. &gt;&gt; And even though Adam had the whole day for himself, God wants a part of us. &gt;&gt; He is incomplete without us. &gt;&gt; We give him a reason of being. &gt;&gt; Don't you know God is an object of worship? &gt;&gt; God deserves worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why he said, "Thou shalt have no other god besides me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Adam was the first eyewitness. &gt;&gt; To witness the descent of almighty God &gt;&gt; to witness the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He the scripture said he saw he heard the voice of the Lord walking in the cool of the day. &gt;&gt; He saw the voice walking, &gt;&gt; right? So any one of us could see a voice. &gt;&gt; You don't see a voice walking. But Adam saw the voice of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest. &gt;&gt; So God has called us here in this generation to a deeper fellowship to see things that the world never saw. &gt;&gt; Glor. &gt;&gt; And Jesus told Nicodemus, except a man be born again, &gt;&gt; he cannot &gt;&gt; see &gt;&gt; the kingdom of heaven. Good stuff. &gt;&gt; So this kingdom is beyond physical eyesight. &gt;&gt; We could have 2020 vision, but we miss it. &gt;&gt; So God is calling us to something higher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's calling us to a new birth. &gt;&gt; A man must be born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Without that birth, we cannot see God. Amen. &gt;&gt; To see what Adam saw, we must be born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Seven generations down from Adam, we had a brother called Enoch. &gt;&gt; He was a witness also. &gt;&gt; Is it because uh Hebrews chapter 11 gave us some witnesses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then chapter 12, he started off saying, "Seeing therefore, brethren, we are compass with so great a cloud of witnesses. &gt;&gt; Let us lay aside every weight &gt;&gt; and the sin which that so easily beset us, and let us &gt;&gt; run, &gt;&gt; run with." &gt;&gt; How could you run with P? You are running. &gt;&gt; When you are running, you are going fast. But he said run with patience. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet always taught us that the first person you must have patience with is &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Many times we cannot wait on God but this race we run with patience. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, cloud of witnesses, we heard about a witness called &gt;&gt; Enoch. &gt;&gt; And Enoch lived seven generations down from Adam. He was the seventh from Adam. And seven is a number of completion. &gt;&gt; We are living in a seventh age now &gt;&gt; and this is the end of all time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Enoch was a man that the scripture said he walked with God till he was not. &gt;&gt; For God took him. He was translated &gt;&gt; a man that had a relationship with God and he would talk with God and communicate with God until one day the fellowship was so sweet &gt;&gt; that he didn't decide to go back home. &gt;&gt; He just continued walking with God. &gt;&gt; Would you want a walk with like that? &gt;&gt; Would you like a walk like that &gt;&gt; where we leave the things of this world behind? Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; fresh man, brother. &gt;&gt; Your job cannot be more important than God. &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb showed us that yesterday. Once God calls us, he calls us to give up something. &gt;&gt; So the things of this world cannot hold us down. &gt;&gt; So Enoch walked with God till he was not. But he had a testimony that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; Enoch built the pyramids. something that is still standing today. &gt;&gt; The first man that hit the first ratio, he was translated &gt;&gt; was a man that built a statue. Hallelujah. That is still standing today. And there is a bride that will hit a statue. Was it &gt;&gt; brother &gt;&gt; Isaiah I believe was saying this picture we have in the church of the statue. Was it you, brother? One day that has to come off the wall. &gt;&gt; You have Peter told us of a statue of a perfect man, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; And love is the capstone. &gt;&gt; But one day that statue of a perfect man, that nature has to come off the wall. We are that people. &gt;&gt; Don't you know you are the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; John saw a city coming down as a bride adorned for a husband. Who is that? &gt;&gt; That's you. &gt;&gt; You are that city. He said, "I'll write upon you the name of the city of my God." &gt;&gt; Jesus told you, I go to prepare a place for you, &gt;&gt; that where I am, &gt;&gt; there you will be also. &gt;&gt; So at this moment, Jesus is preparing a city for us. &gt;&gt; And while he's preparing a physical city, he's preparing a city, a bride &gt;&gt; that will come to pyramid perfection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Different from the rest. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A bride with his character, &gt;&gt; his works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His signs, his wonders, &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; This is who you are. &gt;&gt; You are different from the rest. &gt;&gt; You are called to be different. &gt;&gt; So Enoch made that and he was a witness. &gt;&gt; He saw the glory of God. &gt;&gt; He encountered a body change. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What I want to say, &gt;&gt; God has called us to see things the world never saw. &gt;&gt; If we should die now, where do we go? &gt;&gt; Paul said, "If this earthly house be dissolved, &gt;&gt; we have &gt;&gt; a body &gt;&gt; eternal &gt;&gt; in the heavens, made without hands." So it doesn't have a neighbor string &gt;&gt; it made without hands &gt;&gt; that is waiting for us &gt;&gt; that if we die now we slip into that dimension [Applause] &gt;&gt; that body is here &gt;&gt; don't get frightened &gt;&gt; this is not ghost &gt;&gt; this is a reality &gt;&gt; that is why when they put the ball to cut off his head and Paul watched death. He said, "Oh de, &gt;&gt; where is thy sting? &gt;&gt; Grave, where is thy victory?" Hallelujah. Paul knew that if this be dissolved, &gt;&gt; he had a body waiting for him &gt;&gt; to enter into that dimension. &gt;&gt; So that is why today we watch cancer. &gt;&gt; We laugh. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. We have a body &gt;&gt; that cancer cannot affect. &gt;&gt; We have a body that cataract cannot affect. &gt;&gt; In that body, we know all things. &gt;&gt; In that body, there's no sickness. In that body, there's no pain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that body is waiting on us. &gt;&gt; And that body is right here. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; That body is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you recognize this word &gt;&gt; to be the word &gt;&gt; and you receive a new birth, &gt;&gt; we are taught you receive charges &gt;&gt; from that realm, &gt;&gt; that body receive a charge and it charges this body. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you are born again and you enter in this kind of an atmosphere, &gt;&gt; what we received last night, &gt;&gt; what we received yesterday in the young people meeting and the anointing would drop down, it's the Holy Ghost inside of you responding to that body. Amen. &gt;&gt; You heard from your theophony. &gt;&gt; When you recognize this word to be the word &gt;&gt; and it gives you a charge. When that charges you, sickness cannot stay. &gt;&gt; You cannot remain in your condition. &gt;&gt; There is a real realm that we cannot see. Our eyes are veiled to it. Oh, this is why Elijah when he prayed, he said, "Lord, open the boy's eyes." &gt;&gt; And when his eyes were open, he saw the supernatural horse all around. There's a next dimension that is more real than this dimension that is right here. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; that if we could tap into it, &gt;&gt; our resources are unlimited. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? It's available for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did men see Did we have any eyewitnesses &gt;&gt; of people that saw people from another dimension? [Music] &gt;&gt; Were there any eyewitnesses in the scripture? &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. We had a brother called Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham was called at the old age. &gt;&gt; He was called friend of God. &gt;&gt; And God called him out of idol worship &gt;&gt; to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter where you are and what condition you are in the seed of God just comes out when God calls &gt;&gt; the people around you. Abraham tried to carry Lot, his &gt;&gt; nephew. &gt;&gt; He cried his father, &gt;&gt; but they were not in the call. &gt;&gt; And as long as you fully separate, God cannot bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lot and Abraham started to have contention. &gt;&gt; We know the story. &gt;&gt; We know the Bible. And what happened? Abraham say, "Separate. &gt;&gt; Separate. &gt;&gt; You choose." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And wherever you choose, &gt;&gt; I will go the opposite direction. And the scripture say Lot lifted up his eyes &gt;&gt; and he saw the plains of Sodom &gt;&gt; as the garden of the Lord &gt;&gt; and Lot made a decision to choose Sodom. &gt;&gt; We know what Sodom is. &gt;&gt; We know what Sodom is. &gt;&gt; We living in a sodom sodomic age at this stage. &gt;&gt; And Lord chose that for his family. &gt;&gt; And he gave Abraham the hideway. But sometimes the higher way is God's way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you get the second choice. You didn't get the first choice. But that is God's choice. &gt;&gt; And Abraham went on the highway. But God tell Abraham, "Lift up now thine eyes. Look to the east, north, south. &gt;&gt; All that you see is yours." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That is chapter 13. Chapter 14. You know what happened? &gt;&gt; Amen. Lot end up in trouble &gt;&gt; down in Sodom and there was an invasion of kings down in Sodom and Lot was taken captive. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And a message came back to Abraham Lot is captive. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about eyewitnesses tonight. &gt;&gt; Look at the condition under which &gt;&gt; Abraham will break dimensions &gt;&gt; and see beings from another &gt;&gt; realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Under which conditions? &gt;&gt; And Abraham armed his trained servants &gt;&gt; and he went to deliver Lot. &gt;&gt; Now saints, this is important for us. We cannot love those who treat us good alone. &gt;&gt; Lot gave Abraham the hideway. &gt;&gt; And when he ended up in trouble, Abraham went after him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we willing to go after the ones that mistreat us? &gt;&gt; Are we willing? &gt;&gt; Abraham went after him. &gt;&gt; And he recovered all &gt;&gt; and on the way returning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; On his way back, &gt;&gt; what happened? A dimension opened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a king from a city &gt;&gt; called Salem, &gt;&gt; the city of the most high God, &gt;&gt; a king stepped forth &gt;&gt; and he met Abraham. &gt;&gt; And the scripture said he fed him bread and wine. &gt;&gt; They had a communion. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So that means there were the Paul shows Abraham search for a city whose builder and maker is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Abraham was living, things were hard, but he was looking for a city &gt;&gt; and he found the king of that city and the exact spot where that city would be. Abraham walked on that spot. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the God of that city broke dimensions &gt;&gt; from the seventh dimension and entered into a third dimension where Abraham could see him &gt;&gt; and he fed him bread and wine. Abraham was an eyewitness of the majesty of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When he lived out brotherly kindness, &gt;&gt; when we live for others, &gt;&gt; we would see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We love the Lord. [Applause] Chapter 22, some chapters down, God gave Abraham a test. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, Abraham, &gt;&gt; come up to the mountain and sacrifice your son &gt;&gt; on one of the mountains. I will tell you of. &gt;&gt; This test was so hard he couldn't even tell Sarah. &gt;&gt; She wouldn't have allowed that. And sometimes God call us to make decisions that we cannot let the right hand know what the left hand is doing. &gt;&gt; But we just have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And Abraham went up to the mountain &gt;&gt; and he told the young men with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isaac and I, we are going up to worship the Lord and return. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eyewitnesses of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was going to sacrifice his son. &gt;&gt; But the faith that he had, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; a God that gave me, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; this boy, &gt;&gt; as a old man, &gt;&gt; because we remember Abraham met &gt;&gt; Melchzdc in chapter 14. &gt;&gt; In chapter 18, he met Elohim. Amen. &gt;&gt; God himself, brother, took some &gt;&gt; the 16 elements &gt;&gt; elements from &gt;&gt; a body &gt;&gt; and descended in a body. &gt;&gt; Not a theophony now because aphony you don't eat in that body. &gt;&gt; But it was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Came and he ate steak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He drank milk. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he discerned the thoughts of Abraham's heart. &gt;&gt; He discerned the thoughts of Sarah's heart. Abraham [Applause] was an eyewitness &gt;&gt; and God is calling us &gt;&gt; to be eyewitnesses of his majesty &gt;&gt; to see things the world never saw &gt;&gt; to break dimensions &gt;&gt; witness &gt;&gt; Abraham had an experience with God &gt;&gt; chapter 22 &gt;&gt; when he went on that mountain. Isaac asked him, he said, "But daddy, I'm seeing &gt;&gt; the wood." &gt;&gt; He says, "Everything is prepared for the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But then where is the sacrifice? &gt;&gt; Where is the lamb?" &gt;&gt; Abraham, hallelujah, brother. With tears from his eyes, &gt;&gt; brother responded. &gt;&gt; He said, "My son, &gt;&gt; God shall provide for himself a sacrifice." And sometimes God is calling you into service. You don't know where the money coming from. You don't know where the support coming from. But God will provide himself a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The doctors say there is nothing could be done for you, brother. There's no more hope for you, but God will provide himself a sacrifice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And on that mountain &gt;&gt; as Abraham was coming down with a knife, &gt;&gt; we know the story. &gt;&gt; God called from heaven, he said,"Abraham, Abraham, &gt;&gt; lay not thy hands upon the Lord." He said, "For now I know that thou lovest me." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we will Are we Do we love the Lord more than our families? [Applause] God is first. &gt;&gt; God's people is second, &gt;&gt; our families is third, &gt;&gt; and we are last. &gt;&gt; That is the order of serving God. &gt;&gt; We must never put our families before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Now I know thou lovest me." And in the distance right here, you blew, what was it? A ram caught any tickets. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God provided a lamb for Abraham. &gt;&gt; A lamb was created. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is he still the creator? [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's a God in our generation that created skills. &gt;&gt; We saw we heard from sister Hannah. He created fires. What she didn't have, he could stretch God. &gt;&gt; I want God is still your creator. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Whatever your situation is, he has called us to be eyewitnesses &gt;&gt; of his majesty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus stood &gt;&gt; one day. &gt;&gt; He said, "Some of you standing here would not see death &gt;&gt; until they see the Lord's Christ, &gt;&gt; until they see the glory of the kingdom, the son of man coming in his kingdom, in his glory." &gt;&gt; And then we saw he took Peter, James, and John &gt;&gt; and he took them up onto a mount &gt;&gt; and something took place. His body was changed. &gt;&gt; His reignment was changed. &gt;&gt; It shine as the sun &gt;&gt; in all its glory. &gt;&gt; And here it was. Men that were missing &gt;&gt; that the CIA couldn't find [Applause] &gt;&gt; appeared on the scene. and Peter, James, and John, faith, hope, and charity. &gt;&gt; They knew exactly who they were. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here was Moses. &gt;&gt; Here was Elijah, a man that was caught up in a chariot of fire. &gt;&gt; And Elisha, his servant, saw that. &gt;&gt; He was a witness. &gt;&gt; He saw chariots of fire. [Applause] Saints, when difficulty come our ways, &gt;&gt; it's God allowing it to show us his majesty. &gt;&gt; May God open your eyes of faith &gt;&gt; to believe for what you can see. &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance of things hoped for. &gt;&gt; The evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; So don't wait to see it. &gt;&gt; Do not wait to see it. &gt;&gt; Declare it. Speak it and it shall be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why I read the story with Job. &gt;&gt; Job said, "I've heard of thee &gt;&gt; by the hearing of the air." Yes, &gt;&gt; Job went through many trials. &gt;&gt; But at the end of all those trials, &gt;&gt; he was God, &gt;&gt; but he came down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And a whirlwind. &gt;&gt; He spoke to Job and he sent Eliho, a young man &gt;&gt; to declare the glory of God. &gt;&gt; And at the end of that visitation is when &gt;&gt; Job could have said, &gt;&gt; "I know. &gt;&gt; I know. Yes. &gt;&gt; Not someone tell me &gt;&gt; or the pastor said, but I know &gt;&gt; and the revelation must move from the pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the Bible &gt;&gt; to become a personal revelation to you that I know. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; That my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And even though skin worms destroy this body, yet in this flesh, &gt;&gt; I'll see him. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Job was an eyewitness. &gt;&gt; At the end of all his trials, &gt;&gt; he saw God. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; could it be that God allowed all this in our lives? &gt;&gt; That we could be eyewitnesses. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; that is why Paul taught us, run this race with patience. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; One day, the wheelchair wouldn't be able to hold us. Amen. &gt;&gt; One day we wouldn't need glasses. &gt;&gt; One day the crutches wouldn't be able to hold us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's allowing this that his glory could be made manifest in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We saw these men on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Moses died. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And hundreds of years after his death, here it is. He's standing on Mount Transfiguration. &gt;&gt; A dead man living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we are promised &gt;&gt; that the dead in Christ &gt;&gt; shall &gt;&gt; righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are looking for a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16 &gt;&gt; Paul told us that the dead in Christ &gt;&gt; shall rise first. Right? &gt;&gt; So we are going to see &gt;&gt; dead people coming back to life. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; It happened already &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament. Brother, when the veil was rent and Jesus gave up the ghost, the veil in the temple was rent from top to bottom, the glory of God came out and the rocks the earth rent and the graves were open. &gt;&gt; And the scripture said they visited the believers. &gt;&gt; They visited the brethren. So your house must be always ready &gt;&gt; for a visitation from the &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; from the sixth dimension [Applause] &gt;&gt; what if they come in our homes and the type of music we are playing [Applause] &gt;&gt; we understand &gt;&gt; it's how we love the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; And then we which are alive and remain, &gt;&gt; what going to happen with us? &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cancer cannot hold us down. &gt;&gt; Diabetes whatever it is, &gt;&gt; these bodies will be changed. &gt;&gt; Thank you. And that body that theophonic body &gt;&gt; brother inhabits this body &gt;&gt; and it's going to make a glorified body &gt;&gt; because in our theophony we don't eat. &gt;&gt; The saints beyond the curtain of time they don't eat. &gt;&gt; They don't sleep. &gt;&gt; All right. So they're longing to come back here &gt;&gt; and we longing to go there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They want to be where we are and we want to leave this house. &gt;&gt; Glory. One day these eyes shall see him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We shall be changed &gt;&gt; in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, &gt;&gt; at the last trump. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here was Elijah, a type of us &gt;&gt; that will be quickened. &gt;&gt; Those that would not see that. And there's the Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is where this great union is taking place. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to understand saints, &gt;&gt; our relationship with this word is important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; When Jesus died, &gt;&gt; he went into his theophony. &gt;&gt; He went into a body. And the scripture showed he preached to the souls that were in prison. &gt;&gt; For him to preach, he wasn't a spirit. &gt;&gt; He was a body. &gt;&gt; And there were people in that fifth dimension, that is where the ungodly goes when they die. In the sixth dimension, you have the believers go and God is in the seventh. &gt;&gt; We live in a three-dimensional world and the fourth dimension is technology. &gt;&gt; All right? So, technology is passing here &gt;&gt; right now, but our eyes can see it. &gt;&gt; But there are things on our cell phone can pick it up. &gt;&gt; They know. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our cell phone is not smarter than us. &gt;&gt; Brother, we have an ability to connect with the seven dimension. We have an ability to connect with God &gt;&gt; and charges from that dimension could come down to this dimension. &gt;&gt; That is where your healing is. &gt;&gt; That is where your healing is. &gt;&gt; So we love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus died, he entered into a body, &gt;&gt; but he had a limited time &gt;&gt; because the scripture said &gt;&gt; that body cannot see corruption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he had to visit hell &gt;&gt; and then he had to visit now the brothers that were trapped in paradise. &gt;&gt; Enoch saw him as the wheel in the middle of the wheel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Daniel saw him as the stone cut without hands. &gt;&gt; That is our Lord. &gt;&gt; This was the one that Job said, "I know my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; He had to visit Job &gt;&gt; and all those believers &gt;&gt; and then ascend &gt;&gt; by Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; He had to be out of that dimension &gt;&gt; back into this dimension. So here was Jesus in his theophony watching the body that they pierced &gt;&gt; watching the body that they place crown of thorns on in a tomb. &gt;&gt; And you know just now this will enter back into that &gt;&gt; and I will ascend. &gt;&gt; Although the the rock is there, the rock cannot hold that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever we die, however we die, and however long we are gone, when that time comes, &gt;&gt; death have to give up. &gt;&gt; God is still able to create. &gt;&gt; And these bodies, your form, God took a pity of you when you were at your best. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the big belly and your theophony. There's no big belly. or or or whatever we don't like about ourselves. &gt;&gt; That body is perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That body is the best you could ever be at. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to come back and pick up that body. So what I'm saying, there is a real realm beyond what we could see. And God is trying to sensitize us to that realm because one day, brother, we are to break dimensions out of this realm into that realm. &gt;&gt; A body change is awaiting us. And this is where God is calling us now to be eyewitnesses of his majesty. &gt;&gt; The message is moving beyond words and is becoming flesh. &gt;&gt; God is calling us for a change. We love the Lord Jesus this morning. &gt;&gt; I don't want to take much more time. May we all stand by God's grace as we have brother Jimmy to come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Praise God. It's okay. It's okay. God bless you all. As you're standing, I was wondering what will I say when they he's preaching. I don't know what he's going to preach and what he's going to be and what will I say but uh I I see it connecting. We're going to read Isaiah Isaiah 6. Amen. Isaiah 6 and and and I I'll give it a seminate like just build up from where he's is is he's is left. Amen. So that we have a good time in the Lord. Amen. Isaiah 6 says, "In the year that King Oziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, iron lifted up and the train filled his temple." Praise God. Isaiah was a witness. My my my hallelujah. He says, "Above it stood the seraphims and each one had six wings. Uh with train he covered his face and with train he covers his feet and with train he did fly and one cried unto the other and say holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe is me, for I'm undone, because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for the mine eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts." Then flew one of the seraraphims unto me, having a life coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar, and laid it upon my mouth, and said, "Lo, this has touched thy lips. Thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged. Also I heard a voice from the Lord saying whom shall I send? Who will go for us? Then said I here am I. Send me. Hallelujah. Praise God. My my my my. While we still standing, let's also read uh uh Ephesians 2:56 5 and 6. It says even we we were dead and sins hath uh uh he quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved and hath raised up uh us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Praise God. Amen. We are true witnesses. Amen. Praise God. Hebrews uh uh uh uh 10 Hebrews 10:16-22 also says, "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayeth the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and iniquity will I remember no more." And now uh uh where where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having an high priest uh over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart. We are invited to become witnesses. Amen. in in and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Praise God. And my little title just to add to what the brother is saying is in his presence. &gt;&gt; That is our little title. We are called to come in his presence to be true witnesses. Hallelujah. In his presence. Hallelujah. coming in his presence. My my my man was created uh to be in the presence of God. We have heard in the Garden of Eden uh man was created to be in the presence of God. If you can, you may be seated, but if you want, you can still stand. Hallelujah. Man was created to be in the presence of God. We heard that Adam uh every cool of the evening God would come because there's a part of you that God always energizes. When he comes and appears, something in you is energized. Praise God. Amen. There's a seed word in you. He said it which gets energized by that presence of God. That's why God would come every day in the eul of the evening to meet Adam to energize him praise God but man fell. They fell out of the presence of God and uh and and and in uh that day on Calvary uh it it says uh a man took to wondering. They were wondering looking for a city whose builder and maker is God. Hallelujah. They knew that somehow this problem that has befallen the human race of being separated with God, somehow and if man could only find a way back to God, uh they can talk it over with God. Uh if you can only find a way back to the presence of God, uh you can talk it over. But there was no way. There was no way man was separated because of sin. But praise God for that day on Calvary. That day on Calvary, Jesus came and paid it all. He cried, "It is finished." And when he cried, "It is finished," the veil in the temple was rent. The way to God was open. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. And let me tell you, it was rent from top to bottom. Why? Because God it it was the one who was tearing was actually in heaven. It was up high. It was showing you it's God opening the way. Praise God. Amen. Into that temple. And remember in the Old Testament there was the holy of holies, the holiest where the shikina glory was. And and in that shikina glory only one man would enter and only once in a year to be a witness of that shakina glory. And he would not enter without blood. And he was not going to be playing when he enters there. Because when he sees the glory of God, he will die because of sin. Hallelujah. And what did they do when he enters there? They used to put a rope on them. So that if he dies in the presence of God, no one will enter there to get him out because they will also die. So they would put a rope and then they would pull them out. But do you know how they knew that the person has died in there? Because they are not going in there. They put bells on their feet so that when they were walking in the presence of God, the bells were going Kenj. They were going holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. There was some noise inside there to show that there was life. Can I hear some noise here to show that there is life? Come on, say hallelujah. Hallelujah. And in that presence of God when uh the road of Aaron it was a dead dry stick. When it was placed in that presence of God it produced leaves and it produced fruits. Then they knew that this stick was taken from the almond tree. When you come in the presence of God I don't care how dry you are. I don't care how sinful you are. When we bring you in the presence of God, uh you are going to produce leaves. Uh then we shall know that this sister was taken from the tree of prophetess. She was taken. He was taken from a tree of preachers. Let's put you in the presence of God. Something in you will wake up. Whatever God has put in you before the foundation of the world, all that it needs is to come in the presence of God and it's going to blossom. You're going to prophesy. You're going to see visions. Uh you're going to speak in tongues. Uh then we shall know that this one was taken from a tree of tongue speakers. Praise God. Amen. We are called to be witnesses. We are called to be witnesses. Praise God. And there was mana in that presence that was not rotting. If we bring your life in the presence of God, your life is not going to rot. We are not going to hear some adultery. We are not going to hear some stealing. We are not going to hear some homosexuality. Come on. We got to go in the presence of God. The preacher is inviting us to go and become eyewitnesses to see God. Oh yes, Isaiah. Hallelujah. So the Lord his eyes were open to see the Lord. May God open our eyes today that we may behold the glory of God. That we may see the presence of God. And when he saw it, amen, he said, "Wo is me &gt;&gt; for I'm undone." You can't come in the presence of God and remain proud. You can't come in the presence of God and remain a sinner. He was he was there and he cried. He says, "I'm undone." When you come and become a real witness of this presence of God, uh you are going to humble yourself. Uh you are going to say, "Lord, forgive my sins." Uh praise God. Amen. And you know the story never just ended there. Something happened. One of the saraphims picked a burning call from the altar of God and came to uh Isaiah to come and pass the call where the problem was. He says, "I'm a man of unclean lips." The saraphim heard his sin. The saraphim heard his problem. He took the call and passed it on his lips. And he says you are clean. I don't care where your problem is. Uh maybe your eyes like looking at nakedness. Maybe your eyes look like looking at pornography. Maybe your eyes. But on those same eyes as I'm preaching right now, the seraraphim is taking a call from the burning altar and pass it on your eyes so that you can see visions. So that you can see visions. Maybe your problem is you like speaking evil. You like cursing. But praise God uh the seraphim is passing it on your throat that you're going to be a good believer that you're going to prophesy that you're going to speak the words of God. Praise God. We are coming to be eyewitnesses. Praise God and hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There were people who came in the presence of God. My things happened to them. Isaiah was cleansed and God says whom shall I send? When he cleanses you, you are ready to serve. You are ready to do something for the Lord. That's why he's cleansing you. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was many that came in the presence of God. Other eyewitnesses. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus was invited &gt;&gt; by a guy a guy called Simon. He invited him to mock him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But praise God, while he was in the house of Simon, he was not welcome. &gt;&gt; And and and and we hear we hear a sermon, the unwelcomed Christ. &gt;&gt; Many churches would gather like brother Brooks was saying, they do their religion &gt;&gt; and they go out and Jesus is not welcome. Hallelujah. But we are not going to be like Simon. We want to welcome him in this service. Hallelujah. There was one called Mary. She was passing by and she looked and say, "Is that Jesus in the house of Simon with dirty feet?" Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, brother, sister, Jesus is here. Hallelujah. And she said, "I can't wait." She broke the protocols. She broke the order. She entered in that house and went at his feet and cried and washed his feet with her tears. And then she dried them with her hair. She said, "You were there." When Jesus found me, you did not feel what I felt when he wrote his loving arms around me. And you don't know the course of the oil in that alabaster box. She broke the alabaster box. She washed his feet. Oh, where are the merries today? When the presence of God appears in our midst like it is appearing right now. You can ask me, preacherman, how do you know that Jesus is here? He who promised cannot lie. Remember we said that God can't lie. He said where are two or three are gathered in the midst there I am somewhere somewhere in this building. Maybe it is here. Maybe it is there. Jesus is somewhere. Jesus is moving in this place. And uh you can approach him like Mary did and cried on his feet and say forgive me. He c she cried washed his feet with her tears and those sweet words came out from Jesus. Oh Mary, your sins which are many, they are forgiven. Hallelujah. Oh, he's saying those same words tonight. He's saying those same words today. Your sins which are many, they are forgiven. We are invited to approach him. We are invited to be his witnesses. Another guy came into the presence of God. His name was Jacob. As we are standing up, as we are standing up, I'm about to close. His name was Jacob. He came in the presence of God and he got a hold of the angel. He says, "I'll not let you go until you bless me." That's what you got to do. That's what I got to do. As we are in these services, as we are coming to the end of these services, the presence of God moving around in this building right now, you can say, "Lord Jesus, I'll not let you go until you change me." Oh, he he held the angel. Just the holding the holding. The angel knew this one won't let me go. And he hel he held the angel and said until you bless me. And the angel touched him and his walk was different. He's touching you right now. Your walk is getting different. You're not going to walk in that bar anymore. You're not going to go in that pub anymore. He's changing you. Your walk is changing as you are coming in the presence of God. Your walk is changing. Praise God. Amen. and he also changed his name. You are no longer Jacob. You are a prince with God. He's changing your name. You are no longer a backbiter, but you are a prophetess. He's changing your name. You are no longer a crook, but you are a preacher. He's changing your name. You are no longer a prostitute, but a sister in the Lord. Oh, brother, when we come in his presence, something happens. When we come in his presence, something happens. You can get a hold of him right now. Say, "Lord, remember me." As we enter boldly in his presence, claiming the blood of Jesus, saying, "Cover me, Lord." And we enter his presence with boldness. Lord, we are saying changes, Lord. Oh, we want to be eyewitnesses. We want to behold the glory of God. And as we behold the glory of God, we are being changed from glory to glory. We are being changed from one glory into another. From glory to glory, from glory to glory, we are beholding the glory of God. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Oh yes Lord. Oh Lord, we appreciate you. Oh, thank you Lord. As brother books take over. Yes. Thank you Lord. Thank you, Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; What an amazing weekend. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here this morning who would love to give their lives to the Lord? Let's see by the raising of your hand. But God has been so good to us. And if the Lord should touch you at some another uh other time, another time you you see the ministers and you see uh uh uh brother Simmons and and the other ministers here or even somebody from the church, if you haven't been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you have not yet seen that another dimension &gt;&gt; where God reveals who he really is. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we thank you all for being here. &gt;&gt; Let's give each other a round of applause. [Music] We we come to the end of our services and it has been wonderful. Lord has been good. We have been all eyewitnesses of God today or and throughout these days. But let us bow now in a word of prayer. They have prepared food for you. So, we're going to pray uh over the food. Then we'll be dismissed. We pray that the Lord give you traveling mercies and grace uh wherever you uh are headed back to. Keep God on your mind. It's so late in the evening. And uh one thing for certain, the word this weekend uh will set you free. or it will imprison you. The same uh ark that saved Noah is the same ark uh the same water, excuse me, that saved Noah is the same water that brought judgment on the unbeliever. Keep that in mind as we pray. Heavenly Father God, we come before you. We thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for being so good to us. Lord, you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves. This has been such a a wonderful time. We give honor to you and all of those who participate. Bless them, Lord. Strengthen them, oh God, in your name, Jesus. Oh God, as we travel. So Lord, we also pray for the food that has been prepared. We pray that you bless the food, sanctify it to the nourishing our bodies, oh God, and bless the hands that prepared it. In your lovely name, Jesus Christ, we pray as we are dismissed. Amen. [Music] Heat up here. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.
