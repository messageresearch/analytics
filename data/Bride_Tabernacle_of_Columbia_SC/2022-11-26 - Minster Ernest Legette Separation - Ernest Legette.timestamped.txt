[32:30] second Corinthians 6 and 11.
[32:35] you got to say Amen
[32:38] and it reads oh ye Corinthians our mouth
[32:42] is open unto you our heart is enlarged
[32:45] ye are not straightener in us but ye are
[32:49] straightening your own bowels now for a
[32:51] record pence in the same I speak as unto
[32:54] my children be also enlarged be not
[32:58] unequally yoked together with
[33:01] unbelievers for what Fellowship have
[33:03] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[33:06] what communion have light with darkness
[33:07] and what Concord have Christ with Belial
[33:11] or what part have he that believeth with
[33:16] infinite within infidel and what
[33:19] agreement have the temple of God with
[33:20] Idols for ye are the Temple of the
[33:23] Living God as God has said I will dwell
[33:26] in them and walk in them and I will be
[33:29] their God and they shall be my people
[33:31] wherefore come out
[33:33] from among them and be ye separate saith
[33:36] the Lord and touch not the unclean thing
[33:38] and I will receive you and I will be a
[33:41] father unto you and ye shall be my sons
[33:44] and daughters saith the Lord God saith
[33:47] the Lord Almighty may God have bless the
[33:49] reading of his word maybe see you
[33:51] tonight
[33:52] tonight by God's grace just for a moment
[33:55] I want to minister on a little topic and
[33:58] I entitle this separation amen
[34:01] separation you know a lot of times you
[34:04] know like he says here to be separate
[34:07] you know saith the Lord we know what
[34:09] Paul was dealing with here and he's
[34:12] dealing with the Corinthian Church and
[34:14] how in that time you know that when he
[34:17] came to bring the gospel to them they
[34:19] were you know in a bad place and
[34:22] conditioned within their lives and
[34:24] everything so but he come to share with
[34:27] them the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:29] and the love of God but he was wanted to
[34:33] break it down to them to explain to them
[34:36] in order to receive the full benefits or
[34:39] the or the blessings of God you got to
[34:41] come out from among them
[34:43] saying that come out from among them in
[34:45] in type coming out from you know the
[34:49] world and in the ways of the world so we
[34:51] know that and we talk about separation
[34:52] you know it's in a twofold part you know
[34:55] you know in separation from whatever is
[34:58] contrary to the word of God and also not
[35:02] only separation or whatever is contrary
[35:04] from to the word of God but separation
[35:06] from the desire and the motive to do
[35:08] that which is contrary uh to the word of
[35:11] God so we find that you know God a lot
[35:15] of times you know God is all-powerful
[35:17] you know we find ourselves many times in
[35:20] situations to where we need Deliverance
[35:23] and you know God is a god of Deliverance
[35:26] he is a God that can deliver you from
[35:28] any circumstance in any situation trial
[35:31] there's nothing that you face with
[35:33] tonight that God can't deliver you from
[35:36] but a lot of times what it is for God to
[35:38] give you a total Deliverance he's called
[35:40] he calls out for a total separation
[35:43] sometimes we find ourselves like we says
[35:46] in places in our lives and we want God
[35:48] to deliver us just for the moment
[35:50] because of the pain that we're in come
[35:53] on but God wants to do more for you then
[35:55] just for the moment God wants to give
[35:57] you an everlasting Deliverance
[36:00] he wants to give you something uh that
[36:03] that will totally like we said deliver
[36:05] you from now on all times and but we we
[36:08] find that you know many times I was
[36:10] thinking about a certain situation you
[36:12] know and and some years ago I I knew of
[36:15] a of a female and she was in a real bad
[36:18] relationship and the man was real
[36:20] abusive to her beating her up real bad
[36:23] putting her in the hospital and all kind
[36:24] of things but you know it's something
[36:27] how you know even after she get out the
[36:30] hospital one particular time he went and
[36:32] picked her up from the hospital and
[36:34] brought her home with him you know you
[36:36] know and a lot of times you know she'd
[36:38] call and people would go over there and
[36:39] police would show up or other people
[36:41] would go over there to bail her out
[36:42] certain situations but she would turn
[36:45] right back around and go right back into
[36:46] that same um situation
[36:48] so you say sometimes why would you do
[36:52] that why would you continue to go into a
[36:55] situation uh uh continue to go into a
[36:59] bad situation when you had multiple
[37:01] chances to get out
[37:03] but a lot of times you'll find that
[37:04] person they might say because I love him
[37:07] oh because I love her and that's why
[37:10] they keep going back to that situation
[37:12] but the thing is and that's how it is
[37:14] even with sin the same way God can come
[37:19] down and deliver you God can come down
[37:21] and and do something in your life but if
[37:23] you love that you're gonna go right back
[37:26] to it right so what it is we got to find
[37:30] uh I I said I used to pray all the time
[37:33] when the Lord first saved me I said Lord
[37:35] I said Lord I need you to help me
[37:37] because I'm afraid of myself
[37:40] I don't know what I'm capable of and
[37:43] even though God might have did something
[37:44] for you to turn a new lead for did
[37:46] something for you to uh put you on
[37:48] another page I was always in my heart
[37:51] was hungering and thirsting I said God I
[37:53] need more
[37:55] I need something God I need you to do
[37:57] something in my life that when I get up
[38:00] off my knees I know that it's over with
[38:03] I'm not afraid of of situations I'm not
[38:06] afraid of The Temptations and trial
[38:08] because I've got victory over that now
[38:11] come on and that's what I always had to
[38:13] pray that God would give me victory over
[38:16] myself
[38:17] over my own desires my own flesh my own
[38:20] will because you know you think about
[38:21] even Paul how he says when I desire to
[38:24] do good evil is present with me he
[38:26] talked about a war going on he says that
[38:28] you know I want to do right but you know
[38:31] I'm battling he's talking about you know
[38:32] the the battle that he was going through
[38:34] in his in his flesh but he says oh who
[38:37] can deliver me from the body of this
[38:39] death come on he needed Deliverance just
[38:42] as you and I tonight just as Paul needed
[38:44] Deliverance you and I tonight need
[38:46] Deliverance not just from service to
[38:49] service but something you know God wants
[38:51] to like he says come out he said I want
[38:53] you to be uh be separate saith the Lord
[38:55] that he says that come on you'll be my
[38:58] children I'll be your guard come on in
[39:00] other words I'll fight all your battles
[39:02] come on I'll be your Victor I'll be you
[39:05] know your leader and your God come on
[39:08] there's no there's no uh other person or
[39:12] no other one I know that never lost a
[39:15] battle in all the battles that he ever
[39:17] fought but God himself somebody can say
[39:20] you know I'm undefeated you know yes but
[39:22] sooner or later your defeat coming but
[39:25] it's only one that can remain undefeated
[39:26] and that's God himself
[39:28] y'all believe that tonight you know I
[39:31] I'm a wit I'm a living witness that it's
[39:33] never been a situation that I didn't put
[39:35] before God or give to God he might have
[39:37] didn't answer right away
[39:39] or it might have didn't even look like
[39:41] he came uh uh at that particular time
[39:44] but just I just been patient and let God
[39:47] have his way
[39:48] come on and God worked it out it might
[39:51] have didn't come the solution ain't come
[39:53] as as what I thought it might have came
[39:56] but it came the way God ordained for it
[39:59] to come and when it and when he finished
[40:01] it come on it was better than what I
[40:03] ever thought or dreamed all I had to do
[40:06] was wait on God
[40:07] come on how many believe that tonight
[40:09] but I said that that's what it is
[40:11] separation you know God for a total
[40:15] the uh Deliverance God is calling I
[40:18] believe that for a total separation a
[40:21] lot of times like it says God brings us
[40:23] out he does things in our lives but we
[40:25] got a lot of baggage that we bring with
[40:27] us
[40:28] come on we got a lot of things that we
[40:31] try to bring over
[40:32] that we say hey well I can bring these
[40:35] things over and maybe God will use them
[40:36] you know when God calls you he don't
[40:38] need nothing you got
[40:40] all he wants you to do is be obedient
[40:44] and say Lord thank you praise him along
[40:46] the way
[40:47] because God he knows what he wants out
[40:49] of your life and he knows how to get you
[40:52] where he wants you at to get it out your
[40:53] life
[40:54] you know God had turned everything
[40:56] around you upside down to get you into a
[40:58] place
[40:59] it's a way you can hear his voice
[41:01] get you to a place to where everything
[41:04] else surrounds you come on it's silent
[41:06] and then all you got the only influence
[41:09] in your life then is his is his Voice
[41:12] come on I said that tonight I thank God
[41:15] for doing that you know looking at your
[41:17] life and where you was headed but all in
[41:19] a moment God turn your life upside down
[41:22] come on everything you look like you put
[41:24] your hand to it goes south or or it
[41:27] doesn't work out but what it was you say
[41:29] why is all these things happening to me
[41:31] maybe God is trying to get your
[41:33] attention
[41:34] maybe God is trying to get you to settle
[41:37] down come on to a way you can yield to
[41:39] the voice say Lord I don't know where
[41:42] you're leading me God but here I am I'm
[41:44] here I want to hear your voice and God
[41:46] whatever you have for my life that's
[41:47] what I want to do come on but God and
[41:50] what it is he's calling you out
[41:52] separation how many believe that tonight
[41:54] let's look at one scripture Luke 14 by
[41:57] God's grace
[41:58] don't want to be long tonight but I said
[42:00] a separation come on God is calling for
[42:03] a total separation like I said not only
[42:06] uh just a separation we're looking at
[42:09] from the physical but even your motives
[42:11] and your desires you know God can
[42:14] physically deliver you but yet your
[42:17] spirit is still messed up
[42:19] your spirit is still uh in bondage
[42:22] locked down you know a lot of times
[42:25] people can be sitting in church but
[42:27] their heart ain't in it come on they
[42:29] desire ain't in it
[42:31] but their desire is still to be out in
[42:35] their streets or be out wherever doing
[42:37] you know whatever you know I was sharing
[42:39] my nephews yesterday we were all talking
[42:41] sitting down talking I was telling them
[42:43] I said you know I was sharing with them
[42:45] some testimonies of of when I was their
[42:48] age a little younger and the things we
[42:51] got involved in and and all of the hype
[42:54] that was around the family name and and
[42:58] all the popularity and all these things
[43:00] but then I started sharing with them
[43:02] after all I telling them about all that
[43:04] and you know the money that I saw even
[43:08] as a teenager from the from the boys
[43:10] selling drugs and all that but then I
[43:12] began to share with them it wasn't long
[43:15] for this one died this one got killed
[43:18] this one went to jail this one doing
[43:20] life this one and I said now you look at
[43:22] all of that I say you look at all of
[43:26] that and what seemed to be uh uh good or
[43:29] what seemed to be hip and all those
[43:31] things I said but what does it mean now
[43:34] so you look at all of that look at the
[43:36] end Story come on I said now what it is
[43:39] it's a whole nother group out there that
[43:41] don't even know you never even heard of
[43:43] you
[43:44] I says but what it is I said all of that
[43:46] you look at all that sometimes and you
[43:49] say what what does it mean what was it
[43:51] worth
[43:52] what does it even matter now come on
[43:54] doesn't even matter but I want to say
[43:57] you doing all of that all of that was
[43:59] done for the devil you know when the
[44:01] devil get done with you he done with you
[44:03] he don't care about you he gonna find
[44:05] somebody else to use
[44:07] but it's something about God
[44:09] with the things you do for God those are
[44:11] the things that'll last
[44:13] what you do for God God ain't gonna
[44:15] forget it
[44:16] come on I don't care how old you get God
[44:18] ain't gonna say I got a new group now I
[44:20] don't need you come on but God will
[44:22] never forget the things that you've done
[44:23] God will never forget the hours you
[44:26] spent in prayer come on your
[44:28] faithfulness your sacrifices God will
[44:30] never forget that come on but he'll
[44:32] reward you Hallelujah come on not only
[44:34] in this life but in the life to come
[44:36] he'll give you everlasting life eternal
[44:38] life y'all believe that come on and
[44:40] that's why I live in for God ain't in
[44:43] vain come on you're living for God is is
[44:46] worth it I said Lord all of the trials
[44:49] that I've been through all the
[44:50] separation all of the pick that all the
[44:52] hardship God it was worth it come on it
[44:55] was worth every tear it was worth every
[44:57] hour it was worth all this all of the
[45:00] being ridiculed God it was worth it I
[45:02] know it was worth it Hallelujah and it's
[45:04] still worth it now
[45:06] because God just just as real as he was
[45:09] at the beginning of the journey
[45:11] he's even more real now
[45:13] I thought I needed him at the beginning
[45:15] of the journey which I did but I need
[45:17] him even more right now come on I need
[45:20] him every day of my life that I get up I
[45:22] need God I need him to keep my mind you
[45:25] know those old Saints say Lord keep my
[45:27] mind I need them to keep my mind you
[45:29] know why because we living in a world
[45:31] that's neurotic going insane I was
[45:34] sharing the other night I said you don't
[45:35] know what the next man beside just
[45:37] thinking you don't know what the man in
[45:39] the grocery store is thinking you don't
[45:42] know what the people at the job are
[45:44] thinking in their minds somebody going
[45:45] through something at home and they just
[45:47] want to go out there and end it all you
[45:49] know my nephews is telling me how
[45:51] somebody just is open up fire in the
[45:53] Walmart on all employees just just doing
[45:56] I'll say that's the world that we're
[45:58] living in come on people are losing
[46:01] their minds having mental breakdowns and
[46:04] still walking around they don't know it
[46:06] so what what do we need we need God to
[46:09] keep our minds we need God to keep us
[46:12] stable I said Lord keep me stable
[46:15] keep my mind right God come on Evil all
[46:19] around you but Lord keep my mind right
[46:22] you know hate all around you but keep my
[46:24] mind right you know things come uh
[46:27] situations come to test and to try you
[46:30] come down there but it's so quick for
[46:33] you to get in your flesh come on and
[46:35] then God can't help you because you and
[46:37] yourself but that's why we say Lord even
[46:40] in those times help me
[46:42] when I don't know what to do that I
[46:45] won't be in the flesh but God I'll
[46:47] remain in the spirit God that I won't be
[46:50] caught unaware but when those things
[46:52] those trials and tribulations come Lord
[46:54] you'll take over how did you make it
[46:57] through it brother Ernest it was God
[46:58] that done it
[46:59] you think about these recent trials that
[47:02] we've been through oh you're so strong
[47:04] no it was God that done it it was God
[47:06] that kept me it was God that kept me
[47:09] faithful kept me strong kept me
[47:10] believing come on
[47:13] I like how Paul he says I fought a good
[47:15] fight come on I finished my course
[47:18] didn't it but I like that part at the
[47:21] end where you say I kept the faith come
[47:23] on you can fight a good fight run the
[47:26] race and all that even finish the race
[47:28] but did you keep the faith come on
[47:30] through hardships did you keep the faith
[47:33] through your trials did you keep the
[47:35] faith when everybody talked about you
[47:38] did you keep the faith
[47:40] when your family turned your back on you
[47:42] did you keep the faith come on when the
[47:44] church members wouldn't help you did you
[47:46] keep the faith come on I fought a good
[47:49] fight I finished the course I kept the
[47:51] faith not that I kept it but the faith
[47:54] kept me it was God Hallelujah the whole
[47:58] time it is God now y'all believe that
[48:00] Hallelujah you know in your Christian
[48:02] Journey you ought to get stronger every
[48:05] day come on I believe it was Caleb says
[48:07] that it was so many years ago when when
[48:10] Moses promised me and God because I was
[48:13] faithful he gave me this mountain he
[48:14] says but I'm just as strong today as I
[48:17] was back then come on I might be older
[48:20] I'm 85 now I believe it was he says and
[48:23] that was 45 years ago however long it
[48:25] was that God gave me the promise of the
[48:27] mountain come on he said and I ain't got
[48:30] it yet
[48:31] somebody says well you lived a good life
[48:33] just going to be with with the Lord but
[48:35] Caleb hey he still wanted what God
[48:37] promised him
[48:38] he wasn't going to stop till he got what
[48:40] God promised him like he said don't talk
[48:42] to me about how old I am yes that was so
[48:45] many years ago been through trials been
[48:47] through tribulations but I still ain't
[48:49] got the promise of God yet he promised
[48:51] it to me and I want it Hallelujah and
[48:54] that's what it is sometimes the devil
[48:56] wants you to be satisfied with just this
[48:58] or that no you don't be satisfied but
[49:00] with God promised you whatever God
[49:02] promises you you don't rest until you
[49:04] get it come on God promised you your
[49:07] home you don't rest until you get your
[49:08] home come on you don't be satisfied come
[49:11] on until you got all that God has
[49:13] promised you
[49:14] Hallelujah Lord I want my cup to run
[49:17] over oh Jesus do you want your cup to
[49:20] run over tonight come on
[49:23] you know we living in that hour now and
[49:25] I believe it where you you're going to
[49:28] really have to uh gain a strong hand of
[49:30] faith come on
[49:32] Faith's gonna have to be something you
[49:35] know it's the evidence of Things Not
[49:36] Seen The Hope for the evidence of Things
[49:39] Not Seen come on it's the evidence right
[49:42] come on faith brings the impossible
[49:45] possible
[49:46] come on faith is something that the
[49:49] world don't know about that the carnal
[49:52] the real mind came came reckoned with
[49:55] that faith is hallelujah when you don't
[49:58] know where it's coming from but you
[50:00] believe it's coming anyhow
[50:02] because God said it would be Hallelujah
[50:04] that I've never seen a righteous
[50:06] forsaken nor exceed begging for bread
[50:09] and my faith is going to bring it
[50:11] Hallelujah come on you look at your
[50:13] money how much is your money gonna be
[50:15] worth
[50:16] nothing right
[50:19] was talking about Charlotte the other
[50:22] day went in the grocery store and I was
[50:24] telling him to bring a jug of Grease
[50:25] home the one that usually 9.99
[50:29] what is what 17.99 now
[50:32] something like that
[50:34] I said Lord have mercy food gas
[50:37] everything come on and your money is
[50:39] still just what it ain't moving along
[50:41] with it is it it's depletion ain't it so
[50:45] what are you going to do you're gonna
[50:46] have to have faith in God right that
[50:48] he'll supply all of your needs according
[50:50] to his riches and Glory that God will
[50:53] stretching I believe that you know God
[50:56] allowed those things and and had those
[50:58] things written and a lot of things to
[51:00] even happen in our life so we can see
[51:02] Hallelujah that when the world is in
[51:05] this depression state or whatever
[51:06] inflation or whatever you want to call
[51:08] it come on get your cruise of all ain't
[51:10] gonna run dry
[51:11] because you got to still put God first
[51:13] now come on don't think that hey we're
[51:16] running low so now I got to put this
[51:17] money here and that no you continue to
[51:19] put God first and watch what God do in
[51:22] your life I believe that what's all in
[51:24] my heart you got to put God first and
[51:26] let them be God in your life Hallelujah
[51:30] I think about that when they say Lord we
[51:32] ain't got enough to feed the people he
[51:34] said but what do you got
[51:35] come on two fish and Five Loaves Five
[51:38] Loaves that's enough come on just put it
[51:41] in the Master's Hand come on he gonna
[51:43] take care of it ain't it Hallelujah I
[51:46] believe it God is so good come on but
[51:49] like it says total separation well I
[51:52] mean God is calling for separation
[51:54] because he wants to bless you
[51:57] he ain't just saying come out and he
[51:59] ain't got nothing for you
[52:01] he's wanting you to come out because he
[52:03] got he want to bless you
[52:06] but he can't bless you
[52:08] come on in the midst of and and and we
[52:12] know we got to live in this world so
[52:14] it's not that you know you're saying how
[52:17] we gonna not have contact with the world
[52:19] but it's the compromise
[52:21] come on
[52:23] it's the compromising not just the
[52:25] compromise and but it's it's the the
[52:28] can't think of the word but you know
[52:31] engaging of it come on
[52:33] he says I want you to come out so I can
[52:36] bless you
[52:37] you know he told Abraham he said I want
[52:39] you to get me out of that country from
[52:41] amongst our Kindred and all these things
[52:43] he said in the blessing I'll bless you
[52:45] didn't you he could have blessed him
[52:46] right where he's at but he said I want
[52:48] us I want you to separate yourself so I
[52:50] can bless you come on sometimes we think
[52:54] being alone is is something bad but it
[52:57] ain't always bad God want to bless you
[52:59] come on
[53:01] Hallelujah I believe that
[53:04] uh Luke 14 by the grace of God Luke 14
[53:08] and
[53:09] we'll begin at the 25th verse
[53:13] separation
[53:15] you got to say man
[53:17] Luke 14 and 25 and it reads and there
[53:22] went great multitudes with him and he
[53:24] turned and said unto them if any man
[53:26] come to me and hate not his father and
[53:29] his mother and mother and wife and
[53:31] children and brother and sisters yay and
[53:35] his own life also he cannot be my
[53:38] disciple and whosoever doth not bear his
[53:41] cross and come after me cannot be my
[53:44] disciple for which of you intended to
[53:46] build a Tarot siteth not down first and
[53:49] counted the cost whether he has
[53:51] sufficient enough to finish it he lives
[53:53] happily after he had laid the foundation
[53:55] is not able to finish it and behold it
[53:57] began be and and all that behold it
[54:01] began to mock him saying this man began
[54:04] to build and was not able to finish come
[54:07] on I said separation you know I was I
[54:10] was meditating on this the other day I
[54:12] said Jesus making a statement he says
[54:15] accept you hate your father and your
[54:17] mother
[54:18] children you gotta he said hate them
[54:21] except you hate him you won't be able to
[54:24] be my disciple I said now that scene
[54:26] hard don't it
[54:29] well he's not necessarily talking about
[54:31] natural hates I gotta hate my mom I hate
[54:33] my daddy not natural like that but the
[54:36] thing is he want to show you a contrast
[54:38] that when you coming out to God
[54:40] you can't have nothing before him
[54:44] you can't love nothing more than you
[54:45] love God
[54:46] come on if you love your mama more than
[54:49] you love God come on then you can't be
[54:51] his disciple if you love your daddy more
[54:54] than you love you can't be a disciple
[54:56] why because that thing will come between
[54:58] you and God he wants to get you and I to
[55:01] the place where nothing don't come in
[55:03] between
[55:04] come on to where you sold out
[55:07] to God and that's what it is your your
[55:09] uh individual journey is between you and
[55:12] God Alone
[55:13] come on not you in the church not you
[55:17] and uh the family of Mom and Daddy some
[55:20] people think they'll make it because Mom
[55:21] and Daddy saved no that's between you
[55:24] and God Alone
[55:25] come on God died for you you as an
[55:28] individual got to make it down that old
[55:30] path to that Old Rugged Cross you as an
[55:34] individual got to learn how to get down
[55:36] on your knees and cry out to the Savior
[55:38] come on because he died just for you
[55:40] that little song say he did it for me
[55:43] come on same way Grandma I got it you
[55:45] got to get it same way uh daddy or mama
[55:47] got it you got to get it come on he's
[55:50] that same God waiting on you Hallelujah
[55:52] come on to make your way down that
[55:55] Lonely Road of where repentance that
[55:58] Lonely Road Hallelujah he'll meet you
[56:00] there when you can't walk no more God I
[56:03] beat you there come on when you can't
[56:04] crawl no more God will meet you there
[56:06] come on just because you tried God will
[56:08] meet you there down that lonely road to
[56:10] let you know hey I'm your savior come on
[56:13] I called y'all you heard my voice now
[56:16] I'm here to pick you up take you on the
[56:18] way hallelujah oh Jesus come on he said
[56:21] so so you know unless you hate him come
[56:24] on God God God don't want nothing in
[56:27] between you and him nothing
[56:29] you know the boys at work told me once
[56:32] and I shared a testimony quite often
[56:34] they said one of the boys he said you
[56:37] know I don't respect a man that put the
[56:40] church before he put his family
[56:42] I told him I don't respect that man
[56:44] neither
[56:45] but God is a different story
[56:48] come on it's a difference between the
[56:50] church and God come on a lot of times
[56:52] you do stuff for the church or the
[56:54] church didn't die for you
[56:56] the church can't save you come on but it
[56:59] was Jesus Christ
[57:00] and his blood that was shed on Calvary
[57:03] come on so it's a difference
[57:05] I said that and then he began to say
[57:07] well I don't got no respect for you like
[57:09] that I said you want to know why I can
[57:12] put God first I said because God is the
[57:14] only reason why I got all these things
[57:17] God is the only reason why I got a
[57:18] family
[57:19] God is the only reason I got children
[57:22] I got I got life come on
[57:25] that I'm here today God is the only
[57:27] reason come on
[57:29] all the blessings that I have everything
[57:31] that I have is only because of God
[57:34] so what can I put before him he is the
[57:37] one that blessed me with all these
[57:38] things he give him he can take them away
[57:41] so I thank God for him I said that you
[57:43] know what I says while we at work
[57:45] tonight I said who do you think watching
[57:47] over my family
[57:48] God
[57:50] who you think keeping them that the
[57:52] thieves can't break through and steal
[57:53] God come on I said I said he didn't have
[57:57] he don't have to do it but he doing it
[58:00] he don't have to keep him but he keeping
[58:02] them come on I said so why not put him
[58:05] first he is the beginning come on he's
[58:08] the foundation he's everything you can
[58:11] have the house but he's the foundation
[58:13] of the house
[58:14] Hallelujah and if you don't have the
[58:16] right foundation anywhere it'll blow you
[58:19] down any trial any storm will knock you
[58:22] out
[58:22] but when the foundation is right come on
[58:25] when you started out right Hallelujah
[58:29] the wind might blow but the foundation
[58:31] is still there
[58:33] we can still build Hallelujah oh Jesus
[58:37] come on you rooted right come on
[58:41] the roots are there come on the tree
[58:43] looked like it died but it's still life
[58:45] in the roots
[58:46] don't you thank God for that come on you
[58:49] know it's trials in life that beat you
[58:51] all up
[58:52] come on
[58:53] it's things in life that tear you all up
[58:56] come on you don't even really think oh
[58:59] Lord this this is too hard to Bear but
[59:02] he said he won't put no more on you that
[59:04] you can't bear right
[59:05] so even when you thinking that you
[59:07] already gaining strength
[59:09] because you done gave up Hallelujah come
[59:12] on your strength is gone now he done
[59:14] took over Hallelujah give you different
[59:17] eyes to see to look at the situation a
[59:20] little bit different
[59:21] come on I don't know how I'm gonna make
[59:22] it but how did I make it through last
[59:24] night I made it somehow Hallelujah they
[59:27] sing that song somehow I made it oh
[59:30] Jesus somehow
[59:31] come on but it was God the whole time
[59:34] wasn't it oh Jesus come on separation
[59:37] but God like it says he calling he calls
[59:40] us out he won't separate it but he don't
[59:41] want nothing he don't want nothing in
[59:43] between you and him many of times we say
[59:46] Lord why haven't I received come on why
[59:49] haven't I oh oh got the full benefits
[59:52] Lord why come on but then you got to
[59:54] search yourself
[59:56] you got to search your relationship your
[59:58] life I remember Samuel coming up to Saul
[1:00:01] and Saul said blessed is him that coming
[1:00:04] he said I did all the Lord asked me
[1:00:07] Samuel told him what's this bleeding in
[1:00:08] my ears
[1:00:10] come on
[1:00:12] you didn't do it all
[1:00:14] you kept that what survived what violent
[1:00:16] refuse even the king brought it back
[1:00:18] come on thought that maybe hey I could
[1:00:21] do this but you didn't do all that God
[1:00:23] asked you come on sometimes we got to
[1:00:25] search ourselves Lord did I do all that
[1:00:28] you asked me come on
[1:00:31] not that you just want the blessings
[1:00:33] because you greedy but you need the
[1:00:34] blessings you need God to do something
[1:00:36] for you you need God to watch out for
[1:00:39] you need God to open that door for you
[1:00:41] come on
[1:00:43] you need God to make that way of Escape
[1:00:44] for you and God want to do it
[1:00:47] come on but he don't want nothing in
[1:00:49] between
[1:00:50] he calls you like we said he wants to
[1:00:53] give you a total Deliverance right but
[1:00:56] he calls for a total separation as well
[1:00:58] think about it I said remember it's a
[1:01:01] twofold not on just from the from the uh
[1:01:05] mind and all those other things but you
[1:01:07] realize you know I was thinking about
[1:01:09] those children of Israel I ain't want to
[1:01:12] be long tonight I was thinking about
[1:01:13] those children of Israel they was there
[1:01:15] at the Red Sea even Moses told them he
[1:01:18] says that you know the Egyptians that
[1:01:21] afflict you all these years after the
[1:01:22] day you ain't gonna see them no more
[1:01:24] come on cause I'm a strong he said the
[1:01:26] Lord gonna fight for you they with their
[1:01:28] own eyes watch the Egyptians drown in
[1:01:32] the sea didn't they
[1:01:35] so they were delivered you say for even
[1:01:38] in from the physical in a physical part
[1:01:40] but they were still spiritually bound
[1:01:42] wasn't it come on they still had things
[1:01:46] in their heart that they hadn't let go
[1:01:48] yet
[1:01:49] they left Egypt like they say physically
[1:01:52] but spiritually their hearts were still
[1:01:54] there
[1:01:55] so even though yes they looked like they
[1:01:57] were delivered they still hadn't totally
[1:01:59] separated
[1:02:00] come on because something in their
[1:02:02] hearts were still there
[1:02:04] so they kept going around and round and
[1:02:06] round until God got to the party he says
[1:02:08] all right none of your cross over
[1:02:11] ten times have you murmured you tried me
[1:02:14] and I proved to you I just want to show
[1:02:17] you that I want to bless you
[1:02:20] that I want to do for you more than you
[1:02:22] can do for yourself I want to show you I
[1:02:23] want to be your guard I want you to be
[1:02:25] my people but I want you to separate
[1:02:26] yourself you know the church world has
[1:02:28] forgotten that today
[1:02:30] come on they forgotten that
[1:02:33] that God's people should be separate
[1:02:35] than the world
[1:02:37] God's people he said you're peculiar
[1:02:40] people you should be different the
[1:02:42] church where I forgot that today
[1:02:44] but what it is a lack of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:48] because the Holy Ghost when he comes in
[1:02:50] come on he'll never let you forget that
[1:02:53] because it's him in you living the word
[1:02:57] manifesting his life through you do
[1:03:00] y'all believe that tonight amen
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:13] praise God Amen you appreciate the word
[1:03:15] tonight said you cannot serve two
[1:03:18] masters your loved one and you hate the
[1:03:21] other You Gotta Serve God if you're
[1:03:23] serving God Amen
[1:03:25] the devil don't mind
[1:03:27] if you serve two masters but God does
[1:03:30] Amen because he knows you can't do it so
[1:03:35] so he just smiling and laughing at the
[1:03:38] folks that's trying to serve God in
[1:03:40] you can't serve God and be a part of the
[1:03:43] world system
[1:03:45] so we thank God for the word tonight
[1:03:48] God's word calls for total separation
[1:03:50] from all unbelief if we're not going to
[1:03:53] be separate from the world then the
[1:03:55] Bible said If any man love the world to
[1:03:57] love the father is not in him
[1:03:58] so it's
[1:04:00] if we love God we love him with all our
[1:04:02] hearts
[1:04:03] he said if we love him he'll keep his
[1:04:05] Commandments amen
[1:04:07] praise God it's something that we want
[1:04:08] to do it's not something we're trying to
[1:04:10] do it's something that we enjoy doing
[1:04:12] amen but you can't get the joy of it
[1:04:15] except God be down inside of you amen
[1:04:17] except you have the spirit of the love
[1:04:20] of God down inside you praise God we
[1:04:22] love him because he first loved us
[1:04:24] praise God he cared about us amen praise
[1:04:28] God because he cares amen because he's
[1:04:30] shown his love towards us amen he showed
[1:04:33] us how much he cared about us by because
[1:04:35] he died for us amen
[1:04:38] so because of that amen people struggle
[1:04:41] to try to live for God still could
[1:04:43] struggle to try to live right amen
[1:04:46] they battle why
[1:04:48] because they don't allow the love of God
[1:04:50] to come in their hearts
[1:04:52] praise God once the it allow Jesus to
[1:04:55] come in that means a strong man amen
[1:04:58] that over Fletchling desire amen praise
[1:05:02] God the stronger one is Jesus Christ the
[1:05:04] love is stronger than death
[1:05:06] amen so if you allow Jesus to come in
[1:05:09] there's no struggle we're trying to do
[1:05:11] right and live right why because of the
[1:05:13] love that's in your heart
[1:05:15] praise God if you've got the struggle to
[1:05:16] love your husband to love your wife
[1:05:18] praise God then there's something wrong
[1:05:20] there amen you should not have any
[1:05:22] trouble with loving your children loving
[1:05:25] your family amen there shouldn't be a
[1:05:27] struggle there why
[1:05:28] praise God
[1:05:31] this is well I I I'm trying
[1:05:34] no no no no no it's something inside of
[1:05:37] you
[1:05:37] amen that causes you and that person to
[1:05:41] come together amen
[1:05:43] and then I don't that's a love amen how
[1:05:46] can you explain it can you explain it
[1:05:49] amen but one thing about our action
[1:05:51] shows that we care
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:55] and how you treat God your action where
[1:05:57] you live for you desire see some folks
[1:06:00] are so far out
