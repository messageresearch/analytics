[38:34] amen we're going to talk about
[38:37] the righteousness of god
[38:40] this morning
[38:49] genesis the seventh chapter
[38:52] and we're going to read the first verse
[38:56] amen praise god
[38:59] anybody got it amen
[39:01] and the lord said unto noah come thou
[39:04] in all thy house into the ark
[39:07] for thee have i seen righteous before me
[39:11] in this generation let us pray lord god
[39:14] we are read your holy word and the
[39:16] actual blessings upon her for your glory
[39:17] in jesus christ's name amen you may be
[39:20] seated
[39:22] amen
[39:25] thee have i seen righteous
[39:27] in this generation
[39:30] it is a powerful statement for god to
[39:32] say
[39:34] at all that generation and days of noah
[39:36] when there were millions uh i don't want
[39:39] to say billions i don't know how many
[39:40] but it was millions of people on earth
[39:42] in that day
[39:43] god said to one man thee have i seen
[39:46] righteous
[39:48] i i seen only you righteous in this
[39:51] generation i know i lived in a wicked
[39:53] generation y'all know what the bible
[39:54] says by noah's time
[39:56] it was a wicked time an evil time
[39:59] men were doing all kinds of things let's
[40:01] read a little bit about that we
[40:02] understand what noah was facing what was
[40:04] going on on noah day but noah had a
[40:06] different testimony he was living so
[40:09] close to god that god said thee have i
[40:11] seen righteous before me
[40:13] now we're righteous mean that there's no
[40:16] sin he's sinless
[40:18] and that's a blessing for god to declare
[40:20] you righteous for you to be sinless i
[40:22] know you want to be sinless
[40:24] you can't see the law without sin the
[40:26] bible said the word to the sin is death
[40:27] so noah was sinless there by seeing
[40:30] righteous you look at the word righteous
[40:31] that means you to be declared sinless
[40:34] i don't see no sin in you noah
[40:37] and there's the evil age and the evil
[40:38] generation you live in you the only one
[40:40] that i have seen that is walking close
[40:43] walking with god or doing the will of
[40:45] god doing what god wants done
[40:48] see we need to do what we need to do
[40:49] what god wants done
[40:51] remember we weren't done we won't talk
[40:53] about that so we got to do what god
[40:54] wants done that's the only way god's
[40:56] going to see us righteous we want to be
[40:58] found righteous how many and only the
[40:59] righteous going to be saved
[41:02] only the righteous going to be delivered
[41:04] so you got to be sure by the grace of
[41:05] god that you will be found righteous in
[41:08] the sight of god i want to be found
[41:09] righteous
[41:11] not my righteousness i want his
[41:13] righteousness
[41:15] see we got our own righteousness
[41:17] sometimes
[41:18] we think we right this is the uh the age
[41:20] we live within is the call that they
[41:21] have they ought to see and we know
[41:23] let's see it mean people's right
[41:25] so everybody got a right to think
[41:27] they're right they're doing wrong but
[41:28] they think they're right
[41:30] see they'll be living everybody doing
[41:32] whatever they want to do and they think
[41:34] is right but we know according to the
[41:36] word of god is wrong see everybody got a
[41:39] right so we're living in an age when
[41:41] people think they're righteous
[41:44] regardless of their doing the will of
[41:46] god or not they think they're right and
[41:48] just as far from god's word as they can
[41:50] be
[41:51] see they think they're right because
[41:53] they're doing what they want to do just
[41:54] to be living in their odyssey of
[41:55] people's rather everybody doing what
[41:57] they want to do regardless of what the
[41:58] word of god said and it was the kind of
[42:00] day that noah was living in noble living
[42:03] in the dead where everybody did whatever
[42:05] they wanted to do
[42:06] see regardless of what god's word said
[42:08] it did whatever they wanted to do so god
[42:11] had a man in his hand that he was able
[42:14] to use and know the bible saying noah
[42:17] walk with god
[42:20] see noah walk with god not not god walk
[42:22] with noah now nor walk with god
[42:25] see if we we if god try to walk without
[42:28] we probably take god please you don't
[42:29] want to go
[42:31] see uh we go places that we shouldn't go
[42:34] but see noah walk with god that's very
[42:36] important right there it wasn't god
[42:37] walking with noah noah walked with god
[42:42] and that what god us to god want us to
[42:44] walk with him because how you walk with
[42:45] him by walking in his word we got to
[42:47] walk with god in this eye we can't walk
[42:49] what we want to walk
[42:51] that would have happened to the world
[42:52] and that know was that everybody was
[42:54] doing what they want to do but god had
[42:56] one man that was willing to walk with
[42:58] god walk with his word see stick with
[43:00] the word of god amen so no what day of
[43:03] evil time
[43:04] amen noah david was living in by the
[43:06] grace of god in the fathers of six and
[43:08] one the bible said the king the power of
[43:10] men began and multiplied upon the face
[43:11] of the earth and the dog were born to
[43:12] them that god saw the sons of god saw
[43:14] the daughters of men they were fair and
[43:16] they took them wise of all which they
[43:19] chose so amen they went out there
[43:21] doesn't live in any kind of way that we
[43:22] see people doing today
[43:24] man and giving him marriage just doing
[43:27] everything he can do and god said my
[43:29] spirit and always strive with man for he
[43:30] is flesh also yet as they should be in
[43:33] 120 years ago a number of men's days and
[43:36] see the giants in the earth uh back in
[43:38] that day how they did and all they did
[43:40] is took them women
[43:43] they did whatever they want to do that
[43:44] people are doing today
[43:46] they're doing whatever they want to do
[43:48] no regard for god's word how can it be
[43:51] god declare you righteous when you won't
[43:53] even walk in his word
[43:55] you're not gonna be declared righteous
[43:57] you're not walking god's word and hey
[43:58] that's why noah condemned the world the
[44:00] bible said we're gonna read that he
[44:02] condemned the world because noah was the
[44:04] only one that was walking with god
[44:06] according to what the bible say amen so
[44:09] god saw the wickedness of man the fifth
[44:10] verse that it was great in the earth and
[44:13] every imagination or thoughts that was
[44:15] hard was only evil continually and
[44:18] repented the lord he had made man and he
[44:20] grieved him at his heart so we see
[44:22] what's going on
[44:24] we see what kind of aid noah was living
[44:26] in
[44:27] nobody living in a real bad time but one
[44:29] thing noah did noah walk with god
[44:32] no walk with god god had to come and
[44:35] reveal himself to noah
[44:37] god had been talking to noah in order
[44:39] for noah to walk with god god to come
[44:41] and reveal himself to noah and noah took
[44:44] god's word and nor began to walk with
[44:46] god amen that we need to do in this
[44:48] generation we need to make sure we're
[44:49] walking with god not walking with your
[44:51] friend so much that's all right not
[44:53] walking with your neighbor that's all
[44:54] right but make sure you're walking with
[44:55] god
[44:57] walk with god amen that's how you're
[44:59] gonna get out of here the bibles we got
[45:00] another man to walk with god the bible
[45:01] says enoch walk with god that's right he
[45:05] walked with god and after a while they
[45:07] couldn't find a why because god took him
[45:08] that's right he went up in a rapture he
[45:10] was translated come on somebody he
[45:13] walked with god that we need to do walk
[45:16] with god you want to get out of here

[45:28] heed to his word

[45:35] always reveals his word see noah had a
[45:37] revelation
[45:39] god came to know and tell noah it's
[45:41] going to rain
[45:43] contrary to everything in that day he
[45:45] got a revelation from god that it was
[45:47] going to rain
[45:49] it never happened before and noah began
[45:51] to preach what god told him amen
[45:54] he preached for 120 years but nobody
[45:57] that what it was condemned see
[46:00] faith come by hearing him by what the
[46:03] word of god so noah preached the word of
[46:05] god to those people he preached the
[46:07] bible said 120 years no preach that same
[46:11] message was going to rain but these
[46:13] people didn't believe noah so they

[56:04] the devil's trying to destroy everything
[56:06] that's of god don't want you to think
[56:07] god even real but i said this morning
[56:09] god is real
[56:11] i said he's alive amen because you're
[56:13] the same thing he did in old time he's
[56:15] here amen manifesting his word amen god
[56:19] is alive
[56:20] he's not dead
[56:22] we serve a living god
[56:24] amen that can do everything he promised
[56:26] he can do argue to have a little bit of
[56:27] faith
[56:28] be
[56:29] let's go to the book of amen our hebrews
[56:32] i think it's a little bit of faith
[56:34] praise god not much faith just a little
[56:35] bit of faith usually that faith is a
[56:37] grain of mustard it's a little bit of
[56:38] faith it means you hold on to it
[56:41] don't let nothing stop you from
[56:42] believing it hallelujah don't let
[56:44] nothing stop you from believing what
[56:45] god's word said you confess it in your
[56:47] sleep confess it when you wake up
[56:49] confess it when you walk on the street
[56:51] confess it inside your car confess it
[56:52] everywhere
[56:54] why because you're a believer
[56:56] and god will bring it to pass see when
[56:58] you ain't respecting it it comes to pass
[57:01] then that's how you know it's the lord
[57:03] god bringing it to prayer you didn't
[57:04] even miss me just confessing to what the
[57:05] words say and all of a sudden you just
[57:07] believe it and all of a sudden what you
[57:09] ask god for manifest it lord have mercy
[57:13] amen god manifested amen
[57:16] notice hebrews 11 and 7 by faith noah
[57:20] being warned of god of things not seen
[57:22] as yet see it wasn't material yet
[57:25] never happened
[57:26] move of fear
[57:28] preparing an off to the saving of his
[57:29] house by to what she condemned the world
[57:34] why were they condemned
[57:36] jesus jesus this is the condemnation the
[57:39] light is coming to the world men love
[57:41] darkness rather than like or the deity
[57:43] what's the condemnation unbelief
[57:46] you condem because you don't believe
[57:49] therefore a high condemnation
[57:51] nor condemned the world and became heir
[57:54] of the righteousness which is by faith
[57:57] so we become righteous by faith in jesus
[57:59] christ
[58:00] you believe the word that god send to
[58:02] you for your day not somebody else's day
[58:04] then god declares you righteous
[58:06] he declares you sinless in his sight
[58:09] now if god declares you sinners in his
[58:11] sight now he ain't gonna let you just
[58:12] keep on running around doing evil your
[58:14] life gonna have to change some kind of
[58:16] way
[58:18] noah was not there doing nothing wicked
[58:20] no trying to the bible he walked with
[58:22] god that's right
[58:23] so no i didn't do anything wicked god
[58:25] declared him righteous he was sinless
[58:27] but noah didn't go around trying to do
[58:28] no sin
[58:30] see
[58:31] if god's gonna declare you righteous
[58:33] then you're gonna stop sinning somewhere
[58:34] down the line
[58:36] you're gonna start doing what's right
[58:38] you're not gonna keep on doing the same
[58:39] old thing you've been doing something
[58:41] gonna happen in your life go out and go
[58:42] just say oh i'm gonna make you righteous
[58:44] you believe the word are you still doing
[58:46] the same thing you've been doing
[58:48] no that's not what god talking about
[58:50] god talked about something has happened
[58:52] in your life because the change doesn't
[58:53] come you believe the word did you know
[58:55] that bible say faith and when if you got
[58:57] true faith then something might happen
[59:00] a change will come the bible says fear
[59:02] with our works is what dead
[59:06] so if you believe god like the bible say
[59:08] then you'll do something
[59:10] nor believe god and you did what he
[59:11] build dark that's right that's sure you
[59:13] have faith to believe what god's saying
[59:15] god honored his faith
[59:17] and declared him righteous see so noah
[59:19] he condemned the world
[59:22] because of the unbelief didn't want to
[59:23] believe what noah was saying
[59:25] because it never happened
[59:27] in nowhere day amen praise god
[59:30] okay let's look at another script let's
[59:32] read look at the book of proverbs amen
[59:34] proverb the 30th chapter now notice that
[59:36] you've got to remember now this
[59:37] generation we live in is the evil
[59:39] generation jesus calling in an
[59:41] adulterous and sinful generation that's
[59:43] right
[59:44] jesus is an adulterous and sinful
[59:46] generation and we see a lot of that
[59:48] going on see this generation we live in
[59:51] is a real bad generation

[59:56] book of proverbs lets us know uh what
[59:58] kind of generation this is we're living

[1:00:08] parents you're being taught a man
[1:00:10] different things they man they're making
[1:00:11] it bad everywhere
[1:00:13] in the schoolhouse and everywhere so
[1:00:15] they're being taught

[1:01:08] and that was going on see they're
[1:01:09] teaching the children this generation
[1:01:11] had to be disrespectful that's why you
[1:01:13] get a lot of talk back
[1:01:16] they already get a lot of lip
[1:01:18] from children
[1:01:21] because to be taught that

[1:02:47] happen this generation right here they
[1:02:49] can do it and nobody says nothing
[1:02:52] why why you think that is
[1:02:53] it's the atmosphere
[1:02:55] it's the age it's the time we live in
[1:02:57] and that's why it's going on like it is
[1:02:59] and god the only way to get it right
[1:03:01] people got there to come and they cried
[1:03:02] you gotta hear the word
[1:03:04] you gotta believe the word of god amen
[1:03:05] so they don't bless and they curse their
[1:03:07] father don't bless their mother the
[1:03:09] bibles are generating as pure in their
[1:03:11] what on eyes and that we see it going on
[1:03:14] today

[1:03:16] they think they're right they come to
[1:03:18] church when they want them they dress
[1:03:19] how they want her they do everything
[1:03:20] they want to do and still come before

[1:03:32] said the lord still do what i want to do
[1:03:35] okay
[1:03:36] that's the generation we're living in
[1:03:37] though
[1:03:38] there's generating a pure known eye yeah
[1:03:40] they're not washed from their filthiness
[1:03:42] ain't come coming ain't been baptized in
[1:03:44] the name of the lord jesus christ they
[1:03:45] ain't really repented ain't nothing
[1:03:47] changing about them so that way they
[1:03:48] keep on doing what they're doing see
[1:03:51] when you've been washed in the blood
[1:03:53] something happened that's right you've
[1:03:54] been baptized in the name of the lord
[1:03:56] jesus christ and even baptized him and
[1:03:59] he wouldn't wash the bible get washed
[1:04:02] they may wash your sins away calling on
[1:04:04] the name of the lord see wash your
[1:04:06] filthiness away watch that stuff from
[1:04:09] about people ain't gonna wash it there's
[1:04:10] a generation over how lofty are the eyes
[1:04:13] the eyelids are lifted up
[1:04:16] lord have mercy
[1:04:18] the little house people got
[1:04:20] the lord gave it to you thank god for it
[1:04:23] whatever you got the little car you got
[1:04:25] god gave it to you thank the lord for it
[1:04:27] but this generation lord have mercy they
[1:04:30] get a name-brand car you can't tell them
[1:04:32] a thing
[1:04:33] they think they've arrived
[1:04:35] they think they are the lofty come on
[1:04:38] somebody y'all hear what i'm saying this
[1:04:39] morning
[1:04:40] they're lofty because of what they got
[1:04:44] don't realize who gave it to you the
[1:04:46] lord gave it to you
[1:04:47] without the lord you want to have
[1:04:49] nothing whether you say it unsaved
[1:04:51] everything you got god gave it to you
[1:04:54] god allowed you to have it so don't need
[1:04:56] to be high and lofty you need to humble
[1:04:58] yourself
[1:04:59] brother senator kim preach that man
[1:05:01] humble yourself no matter what you got
[1:05:03] humble yourself amen so this generating
[1:05:06] high and lofty eyelids lift it up think
[1:05:10] you got everything they ought to see a
[1:05:12] well we've got to have need of nothing
[1:05:14] increased with goods see yesterday we
[1:05:17] live in there it's the generation right
[1:05:18] there the generation whose teeth are not
[1:05:21] swords and their jaw teeth the niger the
[1:05:24] body pull off the earth and the needle
[1:05:26] among men help who
[1:05:28] you better get a job
[1:05:31] help who i ain't helping nobody they
[1:05:33] better get out there and
[1:05:34] what see that's that bad attitude help
[1:05:38] whoever you can the lord lead you
[1:05:40] amen don't don't look down remember some
[1:05:43] of them worship and we see our
[1:05:45] contemporary the people that we grew up
[1:05:46] with out there on the street and this
[1:05:47] and bad but guess what was the
[1:05:49] mercy of god that got you out of that
[1:05:51] but with mercy you'd be in the same ship
[1:05:53] i see it every day i thank god every day
[1:05:55] i was coming went to a place the other
[1:05:56] day a man asked me for some money i'd be
[1:05:58] out there sitting down and i don't i
[1:06:00] don't carry cash on me so i gave him
[1:06:02] what i had in my pocket so i don't carry
[1:06:04] cash i gave him what i had in my pocket
[1:06:05] i gave him something anyway my first
[1:06:07] intention was not to give him nothing
[1:06:09] then the spirit of god checked me
[1:06:11] and i said well i don't carry cash so he
[1:06:14] goes to god bless y'all just give him
[1:06:15] that whatever though i had but um lofty
[1:06:20] high high-minded i've been in that i
[1:06:23] would have been sitting down in that
[1:06:24] corner that i still wanted for the mercy
[1:06:25] of god
[1:06:27] i i would have been out there in that
[1:06:29] shape but wanted for the mercy of god
[1:06:31] you'd have been out in the same shape
[1:06:33] running for the mercy of god
[1:06:35] so you have to thank god every day and
[1:06:36] if you can help somebody help them in
[1:06:38] jesus christ's name amen god's gonna
[1:06:40] bless you for it if god put on your
[1:06:42] heart to do it amen a lot of schemers
[1:06:44] out there and you can't discern them but
[1:06:46] god can discern them and let god lead
[1:06:48] you to jesus christ's name but don't be
[1:06:50] the high and generated to be living and
[1:06:53] high-minded and all that stuff going on
[1:06:55] why it's the last days this is the last
[1:06:58] generation
[1:06:59] this is what's going on we see it
[1:07:01] happening before our eyes and sometimes
[1:07:03] we don't know what to do about what we
[1:07:04] need to do is pray
[1:07:07] pray for your children pray for them get
[1:07:09] them to the altar get them to god before
[1:07:10] it's too late because this generation is
[1:07:12] destroying them
[1:07:14] the generation destroying everything can
[1:07:16] destroy this the last time
[1:07:18] if only the righteous gonna escape
[1:07:20] get inside christ before it's too late
[1:07:22] hear the word and believe it god sent
[1:07:24] you a prophet amen believe the word
[1:07:27] amen in jesus christ's name let's go to
[1:07:29] amen um romans the 10th chapter amen
[1:07:32] praise god
[1:07:34] romans 10.
[1:07:36] amen so this is a bad generation
[1:07:39] that we living in
[1:07:45] you see
[1:07:46] the grace of god the bible says serve
[1:07:48] the lord and thy youth that's right
[1:07:50] in the early earlier you can get god in
[1:07:53] your life
[1:07:54] the more blessed you'll be should grow
[1:07:56] up in this world here because
[1:07:58] they get them early in jesus christ's
[1:08:00] name amen that's that's the key to life
[1:08:02] get god early amen before it's too late
[1:08:04] amen get them now lord have mercy amen
[1:08:08] and hold on to god
[1:08:10] amen because it's evil out there as evil
[1:08:12] time young people are going to scream
[1:08:15] doing things they shouldn't be doing
[1:08:17] amen praise god they out there living
[1:08:20] how they want to live they
[1:08:22] see people living like they got a lot so
[1:08:24] they want to follow that example so they
[1:08:25] try to get out there and do the same
[1:08:26] thing a lot of time that leads to death
[1:08:29] a man leads down the wrong road and
[1:08:31] about having plenty it's about serving
[1:08:33] the lord the bible said if you serve the
[1:08:35] lord he said he'll give you desires of
[1:08:36] your heart that's right so you serve god
[1:08:38] the bible says seek you for the kingdom
[1:08:40] of god and his writing he said all these
[1:08:41] things would be what it'll be added god
[1:08:43] to give them to you amen you give them
[1:08:45] to you freely the bible says freely
[1:08:47] given so god will give them to you
[1:08:48] freely you got to go out there and do
[1:08:50] the thing people are doing uh to get
[1:08:52] this stuff you guys have to serve god
[1:08:54] and god will do what he said he'll do
[1:08:56] amen praise god romans 10
[1:08:58] and 1.
[1:08:59] my brother my heart desire and prayer to
[1:09:01] god for israel that they might be saved
[1:09:03] but i bear them wreck they have a zeal
[1:09:05] of god
[1:09:06] but not according to knowledge for they
[1:09:08] being ignorant of god's righteousness
[1:09:11] and going about to establish their own
[1:09:13] righteousness have not submitted
[1:09:16] themselves unto the righteousness of god
[1:09:18] you know you can be too churchy
[1:09:19] sometimes
[1:09:21] that what is your problem was they were
[1:09:23] so so churchy that again we hear what
[1:09:26] god was saying to him here god and sent
[1:09:27] them a savior jesus christ and it said
[1:09:30] we right
[1:09:31] we're gonna keep on doing what we're
[1:09:32] doing we all right we don't need you
[1:09:34] jesus
[1:09:35] and they crucified them so they didn't
[1:09:36] submit themselves to the righteousness
[1:09:38] of god
[1:09:40] they had their own righteousness you
[1:09:42] ain't got no righteousness
[1:09:44] where you get it from if you got it
[1:09:47] you ain't got nothing if you got him
[1:09:49] jesus the bible called him dirty rags
[1:09:51] so you ain't got no righteousness where
[1:09:53] you get you ain't got none
[1:09:55] you got to get his
[1:09:57] he's the only one righteous how you get
[1:09:58] his by believing the word
[1:10:01] amen we will have no righteousness
[1:10:06] no matter what you do that won't make
[1:10:07] you righteous
[1:10:10] giving a lot of money that won't make
[1:10:11] you righteous
[1:10:13] come into treasure all the time that's
[1:10:14] good that won't make you righteous
[1:10:17] you got to get his righteousness
[1:10:20] see we can have our own righteousness
[1:10:21] because we i got on a long dress
[1:10:24] i let my hair grow long
[1:10:26] i ain't cutting them no more i stopped
[1:10:28] that
[1:10:29] and all kinds of stuff so
[1:10:31] i'm righteous no that don't make you
[1:10:33] righteous
[1:10:34] nope that don't make you righteous
[1:10:35] either a lot of girls are they wear long
[1:10:37] dressed they ain't safe
[1:10:39] a lot of girls that got long hair they
[1:10:41] ain't saved see you're not righteous
[1:10:43] because of that oh i pay my tithes every
[1:10:45] sunday like i supposed to i don't that
[1:10:47] don't make you righteous that's
[1:10:48] self-righteousness come on somebody
[1:10:50] that's self-righteousness
[1:10:53] god ain't looking for that you're
[1:10:54] looking for us he wants you to humble
[1:10:56] yourself and just do what his words say
[1:10:59] and then he'll declare you righteous
[1:11:01] here's your problem was they wanted to
[1:11:03] work it out see
[1:11:06] work their own righteousness we look
[1:11:08] what we're doing we're bringing our
[1:11:09] offerings we're doing our sacrifice
[1:11:11] we're doing all this lord we're doing
[1:11:13] every look what we're doing well i don't
[1:11:15] want that
[1:11:16] see israel
[1:11:18] wanted to have their own righteousness
[1:11:20] and that's what a lot of people want
[1:11:21] today they want their own righteous they
[1:11:23] don't want god right they want they want
[1:11:24] righteousness look what i'm doing
[1:11:28] look what i got
[1:11:30] look where i look where i've been
[1:11:33] look at all the places i've been who
[1:11:34] i've been over here all that stuff that
[1:11:36] sounds good but that's not god
[1:11:37] righteousness
[1:11:39] you can't work your own righteousness
[1:11:41] you have to submit yourself the bible
[1:11:43] said
[1:11:44] and have not submitted themselves unto
[1:11:47] the righteousness of god he submit
[1:11:48] yourself to god righteousness but christ
[1:11:51] is the end of the law for writing
[1:11:52] everyone that believeth for moses
[1:11:54] describe it the righteousness of the law
[1:11:56] that the man which do those things shall
[1:11:58] live by them but the writings which is
[1:12:00] our faith speaketh on this why so is by
[1:12:02] faith amen
[1:12:04] so 11th verse amen sort uh
[1:12:08] for what the heart the man believeth
[1:12:10] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[1:12:11] confession and made unto salvation so
[1:12:14] it's by faith
[1:12:16] that god declares you righteous not our
[1:12:18] own righteousness amen let's go to
[1:12:20] genesis 15. and maybe get ready to come
[1:12:22] to a close
[1:12:23] amen praise god
[1:12:25] i just want to be righteous that's all
[1:12:28] i want i want to be just like god so
[1:12:31] noah i want to be righteous in this
[1:12:33] generation
[1:12:34] it's the evil generation i know it is
[1:12:36] you ought to know too so the evil i want
[1:12:38] to be righteous lord how do i be
[1:12:39] righteous but to believe in your word
[1:12:41] for the day i'm living in
[1:12:43] amen believing that word and living by
[1:12:45] it a man walking with god and enoch did
[1:12:47] as a as a as nowhere did they walk with
[1:12:50] god
[1:12:51] see
[1:12:52] amen and god declared those men
[1:12:54] righteous
[1:12:56] god wants to do the same for us we got
[1:12:58] to believe god though amen
[1:13:00] genesis 15.
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:09] y'all know the story abraham
[1:13:12] abraham believed god
[1:13:15] god told him he's gonna have a son
[1:13:17] and abraham believed god
[1:13:19] look at the fifth verse it's god the
[1:13:21] fourth verse
[1:13:23] of genesis 15 and behold the word of
[1:13:25] lord came unto him saying this shall not
[1:13:27] be not an ear but easier to come forth
[1:13:29] that our own bowels should be thou on
[1:13:30] earth everybody had those children
[1:13:33] hey man he came he approached god about
[1:13:35] that see lord what without giving me
[1:13:37] seeing i go childless
[1:13:39] and man he wanted to know why he was
[1:13:41] childish while he was going like this
[1:13:42] right here and then he was telling god i
[1:13:44] got these servants in my house and
[1:13:45] everything i've got i'ma give to them
[1:13:47] because i ain't got no seed
[1:13:49] and god brought him forth abroad and
[1:13:51] said look now toward heaven and tell the
[1:13:53] stars if thou be able to number them and
[1:13:55] he said to him so shall thy seed be and
[1:13:58] he believed in the lord and he converted
[1:14:01] to him for righteousness
[1:14:03] just because he believed that
[1:14:05] god blessed them
[1:14:07] he believed god for the impossible
[1:14:10] something that never been done probably
[1:14:12] never be done again but he believed god
[1:14:15] and god honored his faith
[1:14:18] and god declared him righteous from that
[1:14:20] day abraham was declared righteous
[1:14:22] because he believed what god said that's
[1:14:24] all it is simple faith believing what
[1:14:26] god said believe in god for the
[1:14:28] impossible you believe god
[1:14:30] the bible says
[1:14:32] god imputed it to him for righteousness
[1:14:34] without works

[1:14:39] faith
[1:14:41] god won't put you righteous
[1:14:43] amen we know what kind of life abraham
[1:14:45] lived come on
[1:14:48] abraham walked with god to the bible he
[1:14:49] lived so close to god the god called
[1:14:51] abraham his friend that's right
[1:14:53] amen was called a friend of god amen wow
[1:14:55] he walked close with god amen he walked
[1:14:58] with god
[1:14:59] not god walking out we got to walk with
[1:15:01] god we might take god someplace he won't
[1:15:04] don't want to go
[1:15:06] we had to walk with him
[1:15:08] amen walk with the lord amen praise god

[1:18:33] no more conversation it's finished amen
[1:18:35] so that what it is it means wrong with
[1:18:37] the fourth chapter amen
[1:18:41] they don't understand
[1:18:44] what we as christians trying to achieve
[1:18:48] we're trying to achieve our children to
[1:18:50] live clean and holy
[1:18:51] that's i'm that's what we're trying to
[1:18:53] achieve and they don't understand that a
[1:18:55] lot of times because they see all their
[1:18:57] friends
[1:18:58] in the schoolhouse and different places
[1:19:00] doing certain things they don't
[1:19:01] understand what we're trying to
[1:19:03] accomplish as as christians come on
[1:19:05] somebody
[1:19:06] you're trying to accomplish something
[1:19:08] you want your daughter to deliver as
[1:19:10] clear as you can to the edge you ready
[1:19:11] to give that child away if that's right
[1:19:15] you're trying to do that that's you
[1:19:16] trying to you're trying to accomplish
[1:19:17] something you're trying to do that with
[1:19:19] a little boy that's saying we're trying
[1:19:20] to calm you're trying to raise them up
[1:19:21] they don't want to go out there and mess
[1:19:23] young girl's life up you're trying to
[1:19:24] accomplish something
[1:19:26] you're trying to raise them in the lord
[1:19:28] that's right
[1:19:29] but they don't understand that so
[1:19:31] that's what we got to hold that mercy we
[1:19:33] got to pray as hard we can and
[1:19:34] discipline
[1:19:36] your age lack discipline no not that
[1:19:38] right we don't talk about it they like
[1:19:39] what discipline
[1:19:42] we we scared to hit him for some reason
[1:19:44] i know what it is i ain't scared though
[1:19:48] mama don't let daddy hit me hand hard
[1:19:50] yep these hands are hard
[1:19:53] i had to lift steel with them see how it
[1:19:55] got hard
[1:19:56] and uh and i hear that she know i hit
[1:19:58] her because i i it hurts
[1:20:01] so we can't be afraid to discipline
[1:20:05] lord have mercy we can't be afraid to
[1:20:07] discipline without discipline the bible
[1:20:09] says spirit of wrongs for the child the
[1:20:10] child will go scream one day if you're
[1:20:12] on discipline
[1:20:13] how are you going to keep them scraped
[1:20:14] you don't discipline them you have to
[1:20:16] discipline them oh god and then oh lord
[1:20:18] roman the fourth chapter amen praise god
[1:20:20] amen well i know what it is amen praise
[1:20:22] the lord romans the fourth chapter let's
[1:20:24] see what god said here about abraham
[1:20:26] amen praise god
[1:20:29] what shall we say then that our father
[1:20:31] abraham had found as pertaining to the
[1:20:33] flesh
[1:20:34] as he had way of the glory but he said
[1:20:36] what not before god but what saith the
[1:20:38] scripture abraham believed god and was
[1:20:41] imputed to him for righteousness
[1:20:43] no works
[1:20:44] abraham believed god see none of him
[1:20:47] that workers reward not working of grace
[1:20:49] but of death but to him the worker not
[1:20:51] but believe it on him that justified the
[1:20:52] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:20:55] righteousness
[1:20:56] even if they would also describe the
[1:20:58] blessing of the man whom god imputed
[1:20:59] righteousness without works saying
[1:21:01] blessed are there whose iniquities are
[1:21:03] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:21:05] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:21:08] not impute sin he had a blessing
[1:21:11] lord hamlet let me be that man let me be
[1:21:13] that person lord you don't you don't sin
[1:21:15] too
[1:21:15] you don't want sin in punitive sweet
[1:21:17] descendants what death
[1:21:19] blessing is the man that god will not
[1:21:22] impute sin how did a blessing come
[1:21:23] because you believed the word
[1:21:26] you believe what god said about not when
[1:21:28] somebody else said you believe what god
[1:21:29] said amen abraham believed god come with
[1:21:32] his blessing then upon non-second upon
[1:21:34] the second decision only uh upon
[1:21:36] non-circumcision also if we say the fear
[1:21:38] of wrecking abraham for righteousness
[1:21:39] how would it then reckon when he was in
[1:21:41] circumcision or uncircumcision not in
[1:21:44] second decision but an unsecured i want
[1:21:46] you to listen to his part right here at
[1:21:47] the 11th verse real good and he received
[1:21:49] a sign of circumcision
[1:21:52] he received a sign and abraham did y'all
[1:21:55] know the second decision was that was a
[1:21:56] sign
[1:21:57] of his righteousness y'all know what the
[1:22:00] segregation is for us today
[1:22:02] how do you know what our circumcision is
[1:22:04] it's the holy ghost
[1:22:06] it's circumcised why would it come to
[1:22:07] circumcise your heart
[1:22:10] cut that stony heart on and put a god of
[1:22:12] flesh in it cut it out
[1:22:14] that heart had been stubborn against the
[1:22:15] word of god god cut that out and put a
[1:22:17] good heart inside there
[1:22:19] how do by the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:22:21] come and change your heart you know oh
[1:22:23] hallelujah they don't come in the head
[1:22:24] the holy ghost comes to the heart
[1:22:27] that's right

[1:22:30] holy ghost the love of god and share the
[1:22:32] broad way and your hearts by the holy
[1:22:34] ghost we're just giving them not so the
[1:22:35] holy ghost comes to sacrifice that heart
[1:22:39] get their heart right
[1:22:41] it comes as a confirmation to confirm
[1:22:44] your faith
[1:22:45] abraham
[1:22:47] received a sign of circumcision a seal
[1:22:50] of the righteousness of the faith which
[1:22:52] he had yet being uncircumcised so god
[1:22:55] gave him circumcision to seal
[1:22:58] his faith
[1:23:00] doesn't the holy ghost seal us
[1:23:02] come on somebody

[1:23:27] it wasn't the truth thing god it was a
[1:23:29] type
[1:23:31] of the true baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:33] that seals us into the kingdom of god to

[1:24:50] hallelujah where we at romans the ninth
[1:24:52] chapter
[1:24:54] amen praise god
[1:24:57] amen 9 and 30.
[1:25:03] amen
[1:25:07] i got romans 9 and 30 down here
[1:25:10] i don't look
[1:25:11] what shall we say then that the gentile
[1:25:13] would follow not after writings have
[1:25:15] attained to the righteousness even the
[1:25:17] righteousness which is of faith
[1:25:20] see
[1:25:20] but israel will fall after the law of
[1:25:22] writing and have not attained to the law
[1:25:24] of righteousness wherefore because it's
[1:25:26] sorted by the works thought not by faith
[1:25:29] but by as a word by the works of the law
[1:25:31] for they stumbled at their stumbling
[1:25:33] stone as it is written behold while they
[1:25:36] enzyme a stumbling stone a rock of
[1:25:38] offense whosoever believeth on him shall
[1:25:41] not be ashamed so god justifies us by
[1:25:43] our faith see the gentiles
[1:25:45] that's us that's right amen look at
[1:25:47] another scripture look at the book of uh
[1:25:49] philippians talk about paul
[1:25:51] amen paul had to
[1:25:54] justify you know paul was a hard worker
[1:25:55] wasn't he saul
[1:25:57] working for the church
[1:25:59] doing everything he can for the church
[1:26:01] everything church tell him to do he did
[1:26:03] he was a good worker for the trip it
[1:26:04] wasn't working for god
[1:26:06] see you have to work for god don't work
[1:26:08] for man work for god
[1:26:10] a lot of people think that they work for
[1:26:11] man they're going to be saved but you
[1:26:13] won't gonna be saved because you're
[1:26:14] working man now
[1:26:15] you better make sure you're working for
[1:26:16] god
[1:26:19] you can work for man all you want to you
[1:26:21] better work for god
[1:26:23] paul was working for man
[1:26:26] everywhere the church sent him he did
[1:26:27] and he was doing evil at the same time
[1:26:29] he was killing god's people that's right
[1:26:31] but nevertheless he thought he was doing
[1:26:33] right but he was doing wrong so god had
[1:26:34] to turn them around
[1:26:36] god had to turn saul life around
[1:26:39] because the man was working too hard for
[1:26:40] the church
[1:26:41] then doing what god told him to do he
[1:26:43] was doing what the church wanted him to
[1:26:44] do
[1:26:45] sometimes we think we serving god can we
[1:26:47] do what a man tell us to do that don't
[1:26:48] mean we serving god
[1:26:50] amen we gotta do what god say do
[1:26:52] amen praise god if god tell you to do
[1:26:55] something do it
[1:26:56] amen praise god
[1:26:58] paul right here um
[1:27:00] was doing what the church wanted him to
[1:27:02] do
[1:27:03] and he thought he was right
[1:27:05] he thought he was he thought he was good
[1:27:07] he thought he would be saved but he
[1:27:08] wasn't he was lost to jesus came and got
[1:27:11] him that's right
[1:27:13] jesus came and got paul amen
[1:27:15] god called him a chosen vessel he had to
[1:27:17] go and get it he had to go and get him
[1:27:18] though see that god had to come and get
[1:27:20] us one day didn't god come and get you
[1:27:23] god came and got you
[1:27:24] god came and got me all right so god
[1:27:26] gotta do the same thing you always you
[1:27:28] gotta come and get us we don't start god
[1:27:30] god came and got us
[1:27:31] and god came and got saul
[1:27:33] amen paul
[1:27:34] and changed his life around paul with
[1:27:36] paul very religious very religious come
[1:27:38] on somebody
[1:27:40] very religious man can't you can't beat

[1:27:46] be he told those pharisees i'm a
[1:27:47] pharisee of the pharisees uh uh um under
[1:27:50] the philippines he immediately he talks
[1:27:51] about it he knew what he had
[1:27:54] but all the things he said began the
[1:27:55] media i cut a loss for christ
[1:27:57] amen tonight uh philippians 3 and 9.

[1:28:02] and be found in him
[1:28:04] not having my own righteousness which is
[1:28:06] of the law
[1:28:08] but that which is through the faith of
[1:28:09] christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:28:13] by faith
[1:28:14] see paul
[1:28:16] understood now that it wasn't by works
[1:28:20] he understood how he became righteous
[1:28:22] he understood one time he thought i was
[1:28:24] work doing whatever the church said do
[1:28:27] but now he came to a realization that is
[1:28:30] what
