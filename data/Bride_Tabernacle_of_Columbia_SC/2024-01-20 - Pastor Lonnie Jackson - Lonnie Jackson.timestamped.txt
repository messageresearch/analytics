[1:29:13] appointment cuz I wouldn't let them put
[1:29:14] that pacemaker in
[1:29:16] me my regular physician recommended
[1:29:19] another heart doctor from Augusta
[1:29:22] and they saw me and when I went to see

[1:29:51] he is is a heart
[1:29:53] regulator come on how many know he is a
[1:29:55] heart
[1:29:57] regulator I said Lord I put it in your
[1:30:01] hands the doctor that came to see me
[1:30:05] from
[1:30:06] Augusta he came in he began to give me a
[1:30:09] consultation and he said wait a minute
[1:30:11] he stopped he said let's have a word of
[1:30:15] prayer oh somebody say amen he said
