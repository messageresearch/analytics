week i don't get tired of telling it cause the lord brought me a long way uh we just had a son born you know named damian jr about a month ago lord blessing than that i let christian tell that testimony that uh but uh i was if i could tell that testimony just what you see right now is where god bought me from i know that was about about 14 years ago um i was a fugitive i was a part of the gang i was with the rolling 60 crips um i was on a room fugitive for about three and a half years had a whole nother identity um and i was just lost when you're looking at the world and where i was at i had achieved that goal of being who the man was and we talked about the wars i was a drug trafficker and i was supplying my whole area where i was at and i was the one everybody was looking to i had all the money i had the power but i was miserable and i was addicted to drugs and it just seemed like death was around the corner i had a gun everywhere i went um this pair and i remember just sitting in the barber chair getting a haircut and having a gun on me when i said i had a gun i always had one in the chamber but you had to be ready out there the mentality i had was very different let's kill her be killed the wolves will smell you if you're weak you don't want to live like that it was i was heavily dated all the time because i was just paranoid and couldn't trust anybody but i remember praying one day i talked to my aunt and she told me if you call on the name of jesus he'll save you i remember going out before i made my runs one day i think i had some drugs i put them in the console remember putting my gun right there right beside me and i remember praying on in the driveway that day before i left out i said lord it's a beautiful sunny day say lord if you save me i'll go all the way and i went on doing what i was doing not thought nothing of when i prayed that prayer but i i said it was a little while after that i don't even i would say probably a month even i don't know but i remember i was on the bench for a couple of days i had this place i used to go to was on the golf course that was my little duck off spot when nobody would mess with me these guys they were on drugs and i would be in their basement these people had money and i that's why i would go there i'd be in their basement ducked off you know i remember i was on the bench for a couple days and i was on the couch nobody came downstairs because that's my area i ain't want nobody down there because i'll be on the drugs back and i remember uh i was laying on the chair it was pitch black and i remember that door opened i saw a light coming down the stair and i remember putting my pillow my face in the pillar and when i did that i felt somebody standing over me it's like that light was blowing it scared me and said my name said damian are you satisfied and i looked and my life was flashing before my eyes of everything i was doing trying to make everybody else happy in myself and i was miserable that said my name that voice my bones tremble nobody knew my name i had another identity aliases and all of that but nobody knew my real name and it scared me um i cried like a baby right there i'm talking about boo hoo crying it's not no like it just felt like i just let everything go right then and i just you know went about i just got myself together and i remember going to i went to a guy i was going back to my house and i went to a gas station and i remember saying lord i'm ready and i heard that voice said um i said i'm ready if you're gonna be with me that same voice said i've been with you the whole time um i remember telling the folks i was with i was like i'm done uh i left i was done in the middle i was in the middle of the trent my i would buy kilos and break them down i was in the middle of that and and i told them i'm done i decided to need some money here i can have all of this just give me some money to get home they gave me a hundred dollars after all that all that what i had a hundred dollars and i called my aunt to come get me and i said they was looking at me strange because after all i had i remember going home with a trash bag full of clothes i ain't wanting to take none of that stuff with me um i remember going to turn myself in i took my my own i was i wanted for probation violation and i went took my picture off of the wall and i put it on the glass i said look it's me i'm trying to turn myself in and lady looked at me perplexed and she said just go to the courthouse and i went you know they gave me my time i had a little bit of time by the grace of god they only gave me six months um and i remember going in uh it was up here in columbia and i wanted to get saved but i ain't know how i ain't no like all i knew was jesus was a son of god i couldn't get past the first page of the bible all i knew was god created heavens and earth that's about all i knew about the bible i ain't never really listened whenever grandma took me to church i was trying to go there so i won't get fussed at um but i just remember going to a service and the man was saying if you ask the lord to forgive you all your sins you call on them jesus he'll be saved and i remember going to my cell that night praying and i said and i just asked the lord forgive me of everything i've ever done and i forgave everybody now i never lived with my mom or dad and i think what there was a root of bitterness in me and i had to forgive them of how i felt and all what they did i forgave them you know and the lord and when i asked the lord to forgive me and i forgave them for like somebody threw a bucket of water on me um i remember reading the bible and it just started opening up to me little by little you know the lord started adding on and you know when i got released and i was going on i'm telling everybody i'll say they're like yeah right yeah i say it but they i was telling a lot of them i was made of mine before i went and turned myself in i could have easily went back several times and the devil tried me you know i had a cousin two years ago got caught with six and a half kilos i could have did that back here i can go back where i was at but what's the game the whole world lose your soul um i remember uh my cousin quincy telling me ernest and uh brother simmons had a tent he said i seen you on earnest and i remember ernest when he got saved i thought he was playing i thought he was trying to stick up church because earnest was a you know ernest was that guy he could come up with a plan i honestly thought he was trying to stick to church and i told him don't play with god and before that's for i got saved and he was still going on and i knew he was saying whenever i talked to him i know he was straight up with if he was still holding on and i remember going to that tent and that's where i met my father-in-law at you know then i met uh brother gibbs there brother willihan preached that thing uh that that service and it was a blessing and i remember just talking to earnest and he was just you know revealing things the lord was helping him reveal things for me and the word and you know it's everything he was saying was lined up with the bible but uh to say all that say this that the lord has been rich and mercy on me last year i got an expungement clean by the grace of god man and just to be here talking to y'all
