Amanda's afternoon we want to turn our Bibles to the book of Romans the fourth chapter Romans 4 19 and says and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dad when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform let us bow heavenly father God in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we want to thank you for your word tonight Lord we want to thank you God for what you've done in what you were doing Lord now we pray father God that you'll just move me out of the way Lord and let your spirit have preeminence in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen oh so I wouldn't turn a little bit to the book of Hebrews the liveth chapter you may be seen it and never the chapter of Hebrews while you turn to the book of Hebrews chapter faith in action faith in action we always seem Lee as Christians and non-christians alike we talk about faith and we and we sing about faith we even preach about faith and what God is able to do up your herd assistance in us on that God is able to do it man and I believe that I believe that God is not limited to our circumstances and in to our condition but Bible said what in place that is there anything that's too hard for the Lord you know because of man to us as you know humans are we are limited to what we are able to do physically though we may have good intentions are what might want to do but circumstances are coming arises and we have to alter what we might plan to set out to do but you know I'm looking at you know I've thought about it one time you know that but God goes beyond the boundaries he goes beyond the tough circumstances the thing that seems to be impossible within him they are possible with God Hebrews 11:1 I'm read one and every verse six and said now faith is a substance is the excuse me is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so faith isn't a evidence of something and it's the evidence of not things that we can see but is everything for seeing they that's not seen and I believe that faith has to have some kind of resting place where it cannot grab hold of something it has to have a place that that it can have a solid grip and the Bible tells us in Romans also you know I believe this Teddy said now faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word so it's the word that are being preached in order to hear it all to call our faith to grab hold up on something and there is nothing that I know of solidly that you can really put your confidence in then God word the Bible said one place that heaven pass away but my word shall not so everything around us can fail we can fail all the jobs and everything we have is something to failure but when they come to God word is solid you can rest assured that what God said that he is able to do now I'm obviously also didn't Hebrews 11:6 and stands down but without faith so you must have faith is it without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is see not that he was our or whatever did it me do whatever it but our is solid the way that God you know is looking for the people you don't you too he said now normally there has to be something some kind of proof why we say that you don't have faith in God there has never been a recorded anywhere that God has ever failed I want to read something to you in the Book of Isaiah I was there 55 I'm trying to just take my time and be calm tonight in Jesus Christ's name because I believe that this is where I believe especially now in this our epidemic that we are facing and we have to deal with it and so many times because of a lack of confidence in God is why we lose the victory see because there ain't nothing else on this earth that you can really have a genuine confidence on but dog people have tried to put great confidence in churches and they've tried to put it in preachers and they tried to put it in different things up on the face of the earth and all of it is subject to fail and then the people lose the confidence in the church they lose the confidence in the preacher they lose the confidence in the teachers or whatever they may be because they found failure you see in us there's failure in us but in God there is no failure there is no need for you to fear that what God said you do that he's that able to do it hey man I was there 55 in 10 it says for as the rain coming down and the snow from heaven and return not thither but water to earth and make it bring forth and bud they may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return until me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I send it and see God is reassuring us you know that because he has already spoken the word you know that and it won't return to him board so it must accomplish what he said it would do but it must be grasped upon by faith the Bible say to just shall live by faith the whole fundamental walk of a Christian is by faith you say through grace but it has to be faith to believe that Jesus Christ died and paid the price for your sin and then you accept that by faith if you don't receive it by faith in a do you no good no doubt you may talk about it but if it's not acted upon if it's not received into your heart and then you act on it see see faith reacts faith takes a whole and it calls you to live in a different way amen especially now in the you realize that the older we get and the more we see how much we need God more than anything sometimes we put too much confidence in our ability we put confidence in our economical standard and our learning abilities and our great achievement that's alright but beyond all of that you better have confidence in your God because everything around us is going down but the Word of God amen you know and I'm glad you know and I just appreciate you know God's grace in His mercy that how he's giving us an opportunity to really you know tell the people trust me I've noticed circumstances look hopeless but I am able to do more you know what you can ask a thing but because we have human beings have I guess our little fundamental way of doing things and then God comes outside of your little box God begin to do things out of the way you might not expect God to move and God changes the whole program that we've been looking to because education has been really grasping and technology and and all of these things we thank God for them but it been making us less relied upon who really matters about us that God is a jealous God see the whole purpose that God created us that that we can rely upon him for everything sometimes people just say well our only gonna have we're gonna need faith when I go to church we use faith more than what we think unconsciously you go to your job by faith you know you are you wake up it's God grace but it's faith and we use it because most of us and I mean all of us has prayed for saying God bless me with our house God blessed me with a job God ain't because we needed those things and God bless us with it but when it come to difficulties when it comes to hard things we seem to not have that confident and we can have that confidence in carnal thing how much more we oughta have confidence in God through this because as we realize they have no answers for what we need thank God for what they are doing I really I really appreciate the scientists and the doctors and the nurses and the care givers in a different one putting their life in risk see they got to have faith because they have to go home they have to do this in their in their vironment of it so they have to trust God Lord keep me and God keep them and see if God can keep them through all of the laboring and Lord knows we need it how much more God is able to keep us listening to different things different reports and hearing the scientific world hearing them talking about their situations and different ones have different stories but the main thing that I've noticed that all the more saying there's so much uncertainty uncertainty on what they're dealing with because they have never seen anything on the scale even with the symptoms even with these signs and the different things that's going on they seem to be puzzled how we ever going to get to the end of it how and when is it ever gonna just quit and they have the whole world on is panicking some say that we are ready for it others say we are not ready for it some say they've been trying to tell them that something was coming nobody never took heed to the warning with beforehand it always has been that way you would have come to the things of God God always sent a warning first God never let anything happen except he's sent a warning but the people like in other time never take heed to the warning because it sounds so far out I'm reminded if you know the story of Noah you will return to Genesis 6 you want to turn look at the store in North for a few minutes Noah got a warning from God because the earth had got so heavy populated it got so bad it says the cigarette the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his they shall be at 120 years and there were giants in the earth in those days they saw also after that when the sons of God came into the daughters of men and they bare children to them that the same became mighty men which were old men renown and God saw the wickedness of man was so great in the earth that every imagination of thoughts of his heart was evil continually and it repented the Lord that he made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and because of what they were doing and how bad it got God was getting ready to destroy him but before he destroyed it he told Noah the Bible said Noah found grace you know it's good to find grace in the eyes of the Lord grace means it's a unmerited favor from God and because Noah found grace God spared him and told him to build up for the safety of his family and because nor move with fear can he believe God yet in that particular generation nor had to trust that what he heard Ben was God because they never rained before they never had tile that looked like rain before but nor understood you know the voice of God that he heard you see is something that when you heal from God it calls you to move it causes you to go in action it calls you to prepare yourself when everybody else seem to look at you maybe kind of crazy because they wondering where did you get this from and I no doubt about I said Noah preached a hundred and twenty years it's gonna rain and that generation heard the same gospel that North preached for 120 years but it did not stop nor from doing what he heard God to say he moved by faith see sometimes is screamed at how God comes in and I went but God moves up on you and you got to react to what you hear if it's really God it'll get your attention I just know what this has something recently that I knew it was the Lord and God vindicated it was him you know but when it comes it comes very strange I want to go head back to Roman's folks I want to deal with a little bit of this about Abraham your faith sometimes we rely upon the faith of our preacher but no it has to be your faith see God is trying to build your faith that where you can believe him for even the impossible things you're gonna need to know a man God for yourself you're gonna have to know that he's your Redeemer and he's your provider that here is your healer and only through cause word that he has been trying to prepare us you know to have experience with him now and I can't just get away from Matthew 24:7 about the beginning of Sorrows it just ringing constantly you know because if just as or in the beginning lord have mercy and if we can't run with the footmen how are we going to run with the horsemen and we can't trust God for our families and we can't apply the token to our own lives and we can't believe God for our own selves it's coming down is morally just talking but now it's time to walk in it it's time to live by faith whatever you stand in need of God is able to provide it but only if you can believe it you have to know without a shadow of a doubt that if God said it then I believe it even sometimes when because we live in this outside the world of all these five senses but it wasn't given to us through context spiritual but it's to contact our earthly home smell hear taste feel yes but it's a super sense because you can't it's not by feelings see it's not this part but what you might hear but it's something that has to be in you that's why the whole Christian or experience is the inner work it's only something that God can do in you but so much people outwardly I'll think that because of how they feel that that's it but it goes beyond feeling some days you don't feel good but yet you've got the note that in spite of it God is my healer some days and if you live long enough in this life you will experience things don't go your way all the time sometimes it go beyond our own life that gender that Whedon made you know this decree on our what we call it but we make plans to do things in life there's nothing wrong with that but I believe at the top of your goals and your achievement put God first don't rely upon your education don't rely upon your brilliance in your status you may have in harmful or wherever you act but put God above those things and I believe you put God first above everything you do then God will work it out but sometimes God it erupts our plans saying that how God changes our course not only our but the whole world it's like I was telling my wife I said it's like the earth has been tilt and now everything is I don't care it doesn't change the future the education system all the businesses and all the medicals and everything now has been interrupted now we are scrambling trying to find out where do we go from here what do we do next how do we plan for the next disaster we don't have the enough economical resources to even take another one how are we gonna get back to normal life again that's what they're worried about getting the people back to her there'll never be a normal life the only normal life we can ever have is get in Christ don't even look at the church anymore you got to get in Christ stop looking at your phd's and all of these things that we've been holding so high on it's gone what we are looking for we are looking for something that they'll be able to give the people some kind of assurance the only source I want to give you tonight is Jesus Christ there is no other insurance are sure is that you can rely upon then the Lord Jesus Christ so much look at Romans a little bit more looking at you know I thought about the Bible and so many times we looked at the Bible just being stories that was written and been told but we will never see the reality these things are not just written just to be writing something these were people and they had regular lives and families they had think just like we are having even right they had disasters they had pesters they had plague they had thing that was happening in their generation and I look at how did they handle it they look to God and when they look to God and began to cry out for God then God did something I think that's what we need to be doing you know it used to be a town we said well we don't have time to pray we don't have time now we got the time numbering skills anymore your jobs are closed God gave you the time now what are you going to do at the time when is it really gonna get to the place that we recognize that when we as people begin to acknowledge that God without you we are nothing some say I can't even walk if God don't even hold my hand Oh too many times you know I think that God bends to good and so good to us that we take it for granted that God what you've been doing it's been going unnoticed sometimes we think because of ourselves is is what causing things to be like they are but no it's God's grace Abraham here was an old man and he he hid God had gave him a promise and Abraham and his wife of God told me that he was gonna have a child at an old age and I like the store because it said that without any hope yet he believed in hope in other words there was no physical element that ever Hamm couldn't rely on that God was gonna do that because their own body testified against them but because of what God told him gave him confidence about to say Abraham was persuaded I like Oh God can persuade us that what our promise I'm able to do it not only will I do it can I do it I've already done it I tell you to hear the things I understand down to older people when they had the rough times in the older days and all they could do they call it the whole model of engine they knew how to get down on their knees somewhere and maybe didn't know the best words but didn't say Lord Jesus lord help us lord help my children Lord and look over that they call along the heart they knew that this situation they were in nobody couldn't get her to get them out of it nobody but God and they believed that as God heard their prayer see when you pray you must know that God to hear your prayer Abraham it says in nineteen were says being not weak in faith he didn't even consider his own body in other words he had no confidence in his body in garland you noticed the way God did thing all through the Bible God waited till situation got hopeless when he dealt with Moses he made - Moses got eighty years old you know and how is the 80 year old man gonna leave somebody out of Egypt he can hardly lead himself but God said so it makes a difference when God is in control Z will try to control it but but God you know it when he's in control did it's no more you and I think that the cycle we're in it's gonna be not a man it's gonna be God and God alone when we look up bossy you looked the hills for was come with all of my help that's what we look into tonight looking to late at night early in the morning that's what we're looking to now God has trained a lot of course of the world to change God has given people opportunities and give them a space you know to really examine their own lives to to examine yourself to what really matters right now nothing in the world matters more now I was talking to one brother and he was telling me he said he didn't recognize how much God means to him until the last couple of months I see something has to scratch could we think our jobs mean more and our money in our whatever that we possess we think that's what keep but no that's not keeping you it's God that was keeping you all the time we get this amnesia syndrome you know and we think oh because of how great I became and how great successful that I am and I'm the greatest thing you can't do it without me see and God said no no no I'm God and God don't share his glory nobody people heard a pastor say people if they were returned God given the people's space God wants your faith to be in action not just the thought is time for what we have heard we've heard a word being preached now it's time to put it in action Lord you said the Bible say one place in Peter let's go there sucker Peter second Peter 3 & 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance II God is not slide we get slack but God is not slack cuz sir don't it may look like God ain't doing it God is never too late somebody said he's an old-time God yes he never misses an appointment just when you think he is not there he shows up somebody said in the darkest hours that's when Jesus comes I believe his dog I believe that it's real dark right now in the dark clouds in the world just hanging over the people but thank God that you know that God sent a light in the evening time something to bring the people back to remembrance that God has never failed God has that has been around for thousands of thousands of years about us saying Hebrews that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you know the words what he did back then he can do it now I still believe in miracles I still believe in the supernatural I still believe that God can do more for us than what we can think I asked and he's warned us just you know just trust me if I can get somebody to believe me then I can work we've been in the church we've heard sermons we have talked about it so much to the but become a proverb and when it's time for us to use what we have then we afraid to use it but now it's time for us to put it in action let's take God out of his word tonight about I said fear not little flock come on you can trust God that he has never lost the case I pray tonight Amen that you that are listening you there to that we can really just put our faith in action and that we can just trust God yes I know it looks like it's never gonna end but God got his time so lessons trust guard tonight amen we see our pastor praise the Lord amen god is good amen put your faith in action amen we thank God that we can put our faith in action it was never been a time we need to act upon the Word of God the time is now I was just thinking about several things that God servants said about we're living in Satan Eden I said this is Satan Eden with all the crises in all that it's happening in the world today yet this engagement that a men are ashamed before God that our leaders were plate of politics instead of coming to the rescue of the people in the needs of the nation brothers and sisters time that amen praise God to look at the condition and that's thanks God for help because God can change the situation he meant this is Satan Eden this is the world amen that Satan they meant made a better world a sin in and man is just waiting on opportunity there things could come back together that they meant we can send some more and man is more all about pleasure they meant the world is full of pleasure they said the Bible said men will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so we are living in our time when men is missing out on their pleasure and then want an opportunity to amen to have pleasure again we miss so we missed the ballgames we missed us and we miss that but what we need we need God again way that I believe God is Miss we spin our sudden easy Amen or at the ball game we used to spend our Sundays and if servants on Sunday morning service on Sunday afternoon the stars in his socks was close we need to go back to God people even respected and all to God well we've gone so far can man return can we return but to God can we get back to God get back to our knees get back to cry my god we need you now look a fallen man extreme I said this is a need he made it easy instead of transforming he's deformed the world the world is in a bad shape because or amen the saying Amen it's being glorified and magnified but we need God when God created Eden he made a well they meant in a Eden that man could wash her garden by the world it made me better to sit in man has made it possible that we can they meant we can gamble amen we look to a place that everybody wants to go to Las Vegas and people want to go amen and go to the most immoral places and let's go to the beach and let's go here let's go but let's go to have a model know who want to go to heaven Oh God Oh tell me the streets of pavers gold tell me that we no more pain no sorrow there'll be no more crime no more time they travel will be over to here hey let's go to a better place our world is falling apart now don't leave him in this world was able to come back together again he meant but thieves can calm down for a little season and we accent God to be merciful

unless your people a mint in God bless and his people he blessed the whole nation in the whole world and called her the calm in the storm that's the reason not even God can calm the storm he stood on the scene and he said to the storm peace be still and I said God is saying peace be still amen God hand in it he said peace be still hallelujah well I can see him and the storm going back to where it came from him and I can see the billows of the sea began to get calm and I can see Amen on the horizon even the sea is being calm he met the winds of season to blow praise God and now God amen it's
