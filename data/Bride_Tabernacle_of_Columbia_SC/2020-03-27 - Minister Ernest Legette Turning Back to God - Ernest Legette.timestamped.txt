[16:29] the book of first Kings 18 by God's
[16:32] grace first Kings 18 God is good
[16:46] first Kings 18 and we'll begin here at
[16:50] here at the 25th verse and it reads and
[16:56] Elijah said unto the prophets of Bel
[16:58] choose you one Bull up for yourselves
[17:01] and dress it first for ye are many and
[17:03] call on the name of your gods but put no
[17:06] fire on it under and they took the boy
[17:09] out which was given and they dressed it
[17:11] and called on the name of bale from the
[17:12] morning to the evening saying old Bale
[17:14] hear us but there was no voice nor any
[17:18] of that answer and they leaped upon the
[17:20] altar which was made and it came to pass
[17:22] at the noon that Elijah mocked them and
[17:25] said and said cry aloud for he is God
[17:28] either he is talking or he is pursuing
[17:31] or he is in a journey or prayer of Vinci
[17:35] sleepi then he must be awake and they
[17:38] cried out and cut themselves after their
[17:41] manner with the knives and Lance's start
[17:45] upon them and it came to pass when the
[17:48] midday when it came to pass and when
[17:52] midday was passed and they prophesied
[17:54] until the time of the offering of the
[17:56] evening sacrifice that there was neither
[17:59] voice nor any to answer nor any that
[18:02] regarded and enlarges it and said to all
[18:05] the people come near unto me and all the
[18:07] people came near unto him and he
[18:09] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[18:12] broken down and Elijah took 12 stones
[18:16] according to the number of trials of the
[18:19] sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the
[18:21] Lord came saying Israel shall be thy
[18:24] name and with the stones he built an
[18:26] altar in the name of the Lord and he
[18:27] made a trench about the altar as great
[18:30] as would contain two measures of seed
[18:32] and he put the wood on in order and cut
[18:35] the bull off in peace and laid him on
[18:36] the wood and he said fill the barrels
[18:38] with water and pour on it the burnt
[18:41] sacrifice and on the wood and he said do
[18:43] it the second time they did the second
[18:45] time he said do it the third time and he
[18:47] did it a third time and the water ran
[18:49] about the altar and he filled a trench
[18:51] also with water and he came to pass at
[18:53] the time of the offering of the evening
[18:56] sacrifice that Elisha the prophet came
[18:59] near and say
[19:00] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel
[19:03] let it be known this day that thou art
[19:06] God in Israel that I am thy servant and
[19:10] that I have done all these things at thy
[19:13] word hear me o Lord hear me that this
[19:16] people may know that thou art the Lord
[19:19] God and that thou has turned their heart
[19:22] back again then the fire of the Lord
[19:24] fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice
[19:27] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[19:30] and licked up the water that was in the
[19:33] trench and when the people saw it they
[19:35] fell on their faces and they said the
[19:37] Lord he is God the Lord he is God may
[19:41] God had blessed you the reading of his
[19:42] word tonight by God's grace we just want
[19:47] to talk to you for a moment
[19:48] on turning back to God amen turning back
[19:51] to God
[19:52] we know that the setting here in the
[19:54] scriptures you know that it was in the
[19:57] time of a famine and the famine was
[20:00] brought about because of a drought you
[20:02] know and in the drought what what
[20:04] brought it all the drought and famine
[20:05] about was the sins of the people God
[20:09] allowed it had Elijah going to speak the
[20:12] king the king at the time he have and he
[20:14] says they won't be due nor rain until I
[20:17] called for it why because of the people
[20:20] had left God and the people had went out
[20:22] to Bill and in and served serve bill and
[20:25] his idols so God allowed it you know for
[20:29] a space of time but it came a time where
[20:32] God wasn't gonna put up with it no more
[20:34] it came a time where God was gonna call
[20:37] the people back to him I like how in the
[20:40] scriptures that we read it says that
[20:42] Elijah repaired the altar of the Lord
[20:45] that was broken down I like that because
[20:48] I said you know God sometimes he does
[20:51] stuff in our lives and he gets us back
[20:54] down on our knees again he causes us to
[20:57] come back to the altar a lot of times
[20:59] we've taken the all too away from our
[21:02] homes we've taken it away from the
[21:04] churches what have we done we've broken
[21:06] down the altar of God but I'm saying
[21:08] tonight well we should rebuild the altar
[21:11] as Elijah
[21:13] he built the altar and he rebuilt the
[21:15] altar because he knew that God was doing
[21:17] something but tonight we're talking
[21:19] about turning back to God we know that
[21:21] like I said that there was a time that
[21:23] God wasn't gonna put up with sin no more
[21:26] it was a time that God wasn't gonna put
[21:29] up with the things they were doing so
[21:30] what he did he sent the famine to get
[21:33] the people attention he allow a lot of
[21:36] times in the scriptures things that
[21:38] happen to draw the attention of the
[21:40] people get the people hearts and minds
[21:44] to turn back to him and that's what God
[21:46] does in our lives he allows certain
[21:49] things that happened because as God has
[21:51] blessed us so richly many of times we
[21:54] continue going on and we forgot all
[21:56] about God when God picks us up from the
[22:00] place that we are sometimes and we get
[22:02] back on our feet we forget about who the
[22:05] one was that picked us up so God in his
[22:08] entirety sometimes he allows storms to
[22:11] come he allow trials and tribulations to
[22:14] hit to do what he gets your mind to turn
[22:17] back to him come back to him and he can
[22:21] be your guard again come on he'll let
[22:23] your jaw shut down he'll let your health
[22:25] fail you he'll let your friends your
[22:28] mother and your father forsake you and
[22:29] then even in that sometimes people still
[22:32] won't come to God I said tonight what
[22:35] will it take for the people hearts to
[22:37] turn back what would it take for the
[22:39] people to get sin out of their lives and
[22:42] wanna have a desire to serve the Lord
[22:44] again what would it take tonight will it
[22:47] take guard shutting up to heaven so it
[22:49] won't rain would it take the coronavirus
[22:52] the way is hitting the world today would
[22:54] it take more than that for God to get
[22:57] the people attention to show that they
[22:59] left God how many believe that tonight
[23:01] but we find that here in a Centon I said
[23:05] God had to send a famine he was trying
[23:07] to get attention of the people in that
[23:10] day we know the people's hearts they had
[23:13] turned from God come on and know a lot
[23:16] of times people can go to church and
[23:19] they still do go to church they like go
[23:22] to church and they might sing on the
[23:25] choir they might preach
[23:27] they might pay the tires and pay the
[23:29] officers but yet when God look at him he
[23:32] say your heart ain't in it
[23:33] your heart is still turned from me it's
[23:36] more brothers and sisters than what we
[23:39] do without what appears but where's your
[23:41] heart come on that's what God is judging
[23:44] God wants your heart in the worship God
[23:47] wants your heart and the things that you
[23:49] do for him I believe that Jesus rebuked
[23:53] the first season of that day in a surger
[23:56] season he says that you honor me with
[23:59] you with your mouth even Isaiah
[24:01] prophesied it he's said in your lips but
[24:03] your heart is far from me come on he
[24:06] said you going to church you doing the
[24:08] things where the outward appearance
[24:10] buddy buddy the inside you full of dead
[24:13] man bones and all corruption God don't
[24:16] just want to a worshipping truth but God
[24:19] wants worship in spirit and in truth
[24:21] God wants somebody that's gonna cry out
[24:24] to them with all their heart God want
[24:26] somebody let's go say Lord not only do I
[24:29] need you in the bad times but God I need
[24:32] you in the good times not only do I need
[24:34] you in the morning but God I need you in
[24:37] the evening Lord not only do I need you
[24:40] when I'm sick but God I need you when
[24:42] I'm will God I need you every day of my
[24:44] life that's the kind of people that God
[24:46] wants that's the kind of people that God
[24:48] is calling back to the sanctuary how
[24:51] many believe that but we find that I
[24:53] says you know that's what happened in
[24:56] that day they were going you know they
[24:59] had tore down all the altars of God and
[25:01] they set up the altars of bail no doubt
[25:04] still going to the regular rituals and
[25:06] things but God hadn't forgotten about
[25:09] the people God had to send a famine in
[25:12] that day God had to do something to get
[25:15] the people's or hearts to turn back and
[25:19] that's the thing about it you know we
[25:21] want to take all this time and this
[25:24] opportunity that God has given us to get
[25:27] on our knees and begin to cry out to God
[25:30] and say Lord God whatever I got to give
[25:33] you out of my life I want to ask you
[25:35] today
[25:35] whatever you hold it onto is it worth it
[25:38] will it be worth it when tomorrow
[25:41] you don't know where you're gonna be at
[25:42] you don't know the day when your number
[25:45] gonna be calm
[25:46] and yet you hold it on things that's
[25:48] gonna perish that's gonna fade away one
[25:51] day but I want to say that when you get
[25:53] Jesus down on the inside it doesn't
[25:57] matter what the world does or what
[25:59] happens to this body it's something
[26:01] eternal down on the inside it's enough
[26:03] to get you out of the grave one day I
[26:05] believe that with all of my heart but we
[26:08] find that what's what happens today
[26:10] people they want to bear God's name but
[26:14] they don't buy even though they bought a
[26:16] bear God's name because they know that
[26:18] it's power in their name they know that
[26:21] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[26:23] so a lot of times you know you find
[26:26] people no matter where they are or what
[26:28] kind of condition they're in when they
[26:31] find themselves in trouble the first
[26:33] name they call might not be mama might
[26:36] not be daddy but they call oh Jesus why
[26:39] because they know that there's power in
[26:41] that name but I fear that one day you'll
[26:44] call on that name Jesus any leaders
[26:47] would be to go you will call on that
[26:49] name Jesus and his arm will be too short
[26:51] to reach but right now what God is still
[26:54] available call on that name like you
[26:56] mean it
[26:57] call on that name like you want them to
[26:59] do something for you Oh glory to God I
[27:02] believe that what all about heart that
[27:04] it's time now if we ever was serious
[27:06] about our Christian journey now it's the
[27:08] time to get serious about our Christian
[27:11] journey if we ever was serious about our
[27:13] walking witness since with Christ knows
[27:16] the time God knows there was a time we
[27:19] don't know let's say what tomorrow will
[27:21] bring but we know who holds tomorrow we
[27:24] know that God's got it all in control no
[27:27] matter what's going on God's got it all
[27:29] in control how many believe that tonight
[27:32] but we find that I says what it is you
[27:36] know I was thinking about how in the
[27:38] scriptures in the book of ezekiel the
[27:40] sixteenth chapter and how guardar talked
[27:43] about he was prophesied of how he found
[27:46] israel he says you know what I found you
[27:49] he says you were you were covered in
[27:51] blood he said that your neighbor wasn't
[27:54] even cut
[27:55] he said everybody that walked by you
[27:57] they ain't he looked at your wagon his
[27:59] nobody picked you up but they left you
[28:01] in that miserable condition to die
[28:04] come on and we know that even today a
[28:06] lot of times if the devil would have his
[28:09] way then we would have died in sin we
[28:11] would have died in the condition we had
[28:13] but I thank God tonight for His grace
[28:16] and His mercy he said when I walk by you
[28:18] I saw you I picked you up come on how
[28:22] many that guard um picked up tonight how
[28:25] many God I picked you up and he said I
[28:27] watched you all for you blood cut your
[28:29] navel off you come on come on somebody
[28:31] God picked you up God cleaned you up God
[28:35] he took what the world looked at you and
[28:37] said you'll never be nothing and God
[28:39] made something out of you and he said
[28:42] but when I took you up and I watched you
[28:44] come on I put pearls on your clothes you
[28:47] and of calls you out to my name
[28:48] hallelujah God done those things he said
[28:51] but yet when you got strong come on when
[28:54] you got on your feet
[28:55] when you've got to the condition where
[28:58] you can move around on your home come on
[29:00] he said then you forgot all about me
[29:02] come on
[29:04] I said don't forget about God tonight
[29:05] don't forget about the one who picked
[29:08] you up from a life of sin don't forget
[29:10] about the one who do brought you from
[29:12] sin and shame who heals you don't forget
[29:15] about the one when you get on your feet
[29:17] but stay with God amen glory to God
[29:20] we're talking about turning back God I
[29:23] know he has to remind us of those things
[29:25] a lot of times we find that you know
[29:28] like he says in that day how you know
[29:31] Elijah and how he went and he said it
[29:34] won't be rain come on it won't be due
[29:36] until I call for it he was all because
[29:39] God was trying to draw the people back
[29:41] to him God wanted to do something to
[29:44] turn the people heart back not just to
[29:46] be called by his name wasn't good enough
[29:47] but he was doing it because he wanted
[29:49] their hearts to turn back so we know
[29:51] that even in that time the rain didn't
[29:56] falling you know what happened to
[29:58] drought King but even in the drought I
[30:00] believe that God still had manna for his
[30:03] people even in the drought God still
[30:05] blessed his people with a look you
[30:08] reading this
[30:08] crypsis you see how Obadiah because in
[30:11] first king 17 and how he hid he worked
[30:13] in the king's storehouse and how he hid
[30:15] some of the profits in those and how
[30:17] many they hadn't fouled a neat avail in
[30:20] God still blessed him we think about the
[30:22] shoot of my woman and how she took care
[30:24] of large and how the crews of all and in
[30:27] the mill never ran dry until the day
[30:30] that rain fell back on the earth see
[30:32] that's one thing about it that's why you
[30:34] is good that's a good thing to be saved
[30:36] it's a good thing to live for the Lord
[30:38] because even in the midst of a crisis
[30:40] God is going to take care of his people
[30:42] when the grocery store run out God is
[30:45] gonna make sure you still got plenty
[30:46] when everything is against you in the
[30:49] world God is gonna take care of his
[30:51] people why because you his children and
[30:53] I believe David said I never seen the
[30:55] righteous forsaken nor see begging for
[30:58] bread we got to beg for bread tonight we
[31:00] know God is gonna take care of us how
[31:03] many believe that but we find that I
[31:05] says you know in that day you know it
[31:08] Elisha we're talking about turning back
[31:10] to God
[31:11] come on it didn't rain and famine came
[31:13] and we know that the people they went
[31:15] through something you know to go that
[31:18] made that long of a time without rain
[31:20] and drought
[31:21] maybe going through that time and seeing
[31:23] oh that all of their resources was about
[31:26] to run out and it wasn't nothing they
[31:28] can do about it
[31:29] the only thing they can do is wait for
[31:31] the rain to come they couldn't bring
[31:33] about the rain but Elijah said it won't
[31:35] be no rain so I call for it come on it
[31:38] was something supernatural in that day
[31:40] that was taking place and we find out
[31:42] today
[31:43] I heard somebody say that the virus I'll
[31:45] be going by the summer time I heard him
[31:48] say it'll be gone by this time but come
[31:50] on when yet they don't even know what it
[31:52] is how can we put a time limit and know
[31:54] when it's gonna be going it's gonna take
[31:56] supernatural intervention tonight what
[31:59] its gonna take
[31:59] it's gonna take God being merciful to
[32:02] the world God moving his hands and
[32:04] saying that's enough that's what it's
[32:06] gonna take the doctors don't know what
[32:08] to do but I want to say doctor Jesus he
[32:10] knows exactly what to do when they
[32:12] turning you away telling you don't even
[32:14] come to the hospital where you gonna go
[32:16] - then I say divine healing God is still
[32:19] healing tonight how many believe that
[32:21] glory to
[32:22] gosh but we find that you know I think
[32:26] about that and how you know the world is
[32:28] in a panic mode and they don't know what
[32:30] to do we thank God for their efforts we
[32:33] thank God for the nurses we thank the
[32:35] heart for the doctors but when they
[32:37] don't know what to do
[32:38] we know that Jesus he knows what to do
[32:41] you know if it ever was a time you know
[32:43] a lot of times we profess from our mouth
[32:45] that God is our help salute
[32:47] but right now you gonna find out where
[32:49] the guard is your absolute or not
[32:51] whether God is you're holding all or not
[32:53] why because in this time sometimes God
[32:56] will push you to the limit he'll test
[32:57] you come on he'll try he'll get you to
[33:00] that breaking point but he won't let you
[33:02] break
[33:03] I'm so glad tonight but even in the
[33:05] breaking point God won't let you break
[33:07] oh you've got to do is keep holding on
[33:09] you're God's unchanging hands keep
[33:12] holding on to the word that dog is
[33:14] giving you in guarding unless you fall
[33:16] to the ground I believe that how many
[33:17] believe that tonight
[33:19] Oh God is being so good to us we look at
[33:22] how I said even in that you know he said
[33:25] it won't be rain do talk calling for it
[33:28] come on you know and then we know that
[33:29] it when it came to time we God was going
[33:33] to end the drought first thing Elijah
[33:35] did he win it called for he helped and
[33:37] told people I want to have a showdown
[33:39] come on open mark Carmel he called the
[33:41] people thing you know how yeah I'll eat
[33:46] him and what he done first thing he when
[33:48] he saw Elijah he said to Elijah and this
[33:51] you can go back and you read and he said
[33:53] I doubt the one that trouble if Israel
[33:55] come on and a lot of times the largest
[33:58] Saint the one that troubling is are you
[33:59] to run you the reason why God brought
[34:02] this drought the people wouldn't be in
[34:04] seeing if you wouldn't allowed or put
[34:07] bells or idols and things up and a lot
[34:09] of times we want to find excuses for the
[34:12] condition of the way we are the
[34:14] condition of our lives and in the way
[34:16] our lives are instead of taking our self
[34:19] responsibility and saying Lord it's not
[34:21] that person it's not me sometimes we
[34:23] want to brain the preachers sometimes we
[34:25] want to blame the people in the church
[34:27] sometime we want to blame our brother or
[34:29] sister instead of standing up taking or
[34:33] it's not making excuses for our sins and
[34:36] saying Lord it's me God what can I do
[34:39] Lord to get back right with You Lord God
[34:41] I don't want to believe and oh nobody
[34:43] else is right flying high as I post to
[34:46] event connecting it up with true God I
[34:48] don't want to blame it on nobody God
[34:50] what do I have to do Lord that were you
[34:52] to send the rain back in my life how
[34:54] many want that ring sitting back in
[34:56] their lives but we find that you know
[34:59] how he say you're the one but he says
[35:01] come all you says but let's go down and
[35:03] I want to prove to you he wanted to
[35:05] prove true that the God that they was
[35:07] worship because they were worshiping was
[35:10] wasn't the like the God
[35:11] Jehovah wasn't the Almighty God about in
[35:14] fact was just idols that they will
[35:16] worship he wanted to show them that even
[35:17] in those times and that's what it is God
[35:20] a lot of times he exposes things God
[35:24] exposes things in our house because
[35:26] we're gonna put in our trust in the
[35:27] wrong places we've been putting how
[35:30] trusting man we've been putting our
[35:31] trusting money well I want to ask you a
[35:33] question what good is money gonna do
[35:35] right now what good is a man gonna do
[35:37] right now what good the church gonna do
[35:39] right now we've been putting our trust
[35:41] in the wrong places but he said I want
[35:43] you to quit put your trust and all these
[35:46] material things all these carnal things
[35:48] put your trust back in me I'm the one
[35:50] that can save you I'm the one that'll
[35:52] heal you I'm the one that'll bail you
[35:54] out
[35:54] God wants us to put our trust back in
[35:57] him I believe the Bible says if you
[36:00] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[36:02] come on not some of your heart he said
[36:05] trust in the Lord with all your heart
[36:08] and lean not to your own understanding
[36:10] but in all your ways acknowledge him in
[36:13] God is gonna direct you God is gonna
[36:16] legion God's come on get back to
[36:18] trusting God get back to him with all of
[36:20] your heart and let God lead you God is
[36:23] so good but we find that I says in that
[36:26] day we know what happened I like how I
[36:30] was saying how large or how he repaired
[36:32] the altar come on he repaired the altar
[36:35] I don't know about you but in these last
[36:37] couple of weeks I've been repairing the
[36:39] altar been repairing the altar at home
[36:41] been repairing the altar everywhere I go
[36:43] it's my car or whatever every time you
[36:46] find time to
[36:47] always for praying time it's the time to
[36:49] call on that name Jesus if you ever need
[36:52] it know how it's the time right now to
[36:53] learn how because why one day the door
[36:56] is gonna be shut one day it's gonna be
[36:58] too late
[36:59] God is gonna quit coal and dealing with
[37:01] the Gentiles turn back to the Jews then
[37:03] what you'll be then let as holy or be
[37:05] holy still those that are filthy will be
[37:08] filthy still don't let God find you in
[37:10] your filthy ways don't let God find you
[37:13] in that way but when God finds you let
[37:15] you be holy why because it's the Holy
[37:17] Ghost living inside of you that's holy
[37:19] and it's making you holy I believe that
[37:22] you know we look at how I like how he
[37:24] says he rebuilt the altar then he began
[37:27] to he began to let them go oh you do
[37:29] your thing he rebuilt the altar but he
[37:31] says Lord he says God and he began to
[37:34] pray to him he says I want you to let
[37:35] the people know come on I want you to do
[37:38] something let the people know that this
[37:41] day I turn their hearts back come on
[37:44] I pray tonight that God is doing
[37:47] something come on and I pray tonight
[37:49] that you hear it in the spirit that God
[37:52] is calling you turn back God is saying
[37:54] come on with this was going on turn back
[37:56] come back to me saith the Lord that's
[37:58] what he's saying
[37:59] I pray tonight that even as larger
[38:01] prayed he said Lord let the people know
[38:03] you you turn their heart back I pray
[38:05] that if God give us grace come on if God
[38:08] give us a great set we can come and
[38:09] gather again and meet again freely you
[38:12] ought to praise God like you ain't never
[38:13] praised him before you ought to say I
[38:15] was glad when they said unto me let us
[38:17] come into the house of the Lord why
[38:19] because one day we didn't know that just
[38:21] what happened right now is gonna take it
[38:23] away but God just showing you that
[38:25] anything can happen tomorrow come on
[38:28] things are happening so quick and where
[38:31] you gonna be
[38:31] where will your life be if God was to
[38:34] call your number right now so many
[38:36] people thinking they got time so did the
[38:39] rich man that built the barns but he
[38:41] didn't know that tomorrow he will he
[38:44] woke up he was gonna lift up his eyes in
[38:46] hell why because he thought he had time
[38:48] I want to say we know that you know even
[38:51] Jesus prophesied and begin to say if
[38:55] Jesus begin to say as it was in the days
[38:57] of Noah
[38:58] come on so shall it be in the day
[39:00] when the Son of Man is revealed he says
[39:03] in that day they was eating drinking
[39:05] marries all doing all these things go
[39:08] going on in a natural ways even though
[39:11] destruction was on the way even though
[39:14] the art was being built
[39:15] God was getting ready to destroy the
[39:17] world but that didn't make them turn
[39:19] around that didn't make them stop from
[39:22] the sin and that they were doing they
[39:24] were still drinking they were still
[39:26] lying and cheating in the imagination
[39:28] man Oh heart every page continually why
[39:31] because they couldn't see that God was
[39:33] bringing judgment on the land and we
[39:35] look at now what's going on today
[39:37] I say it's God bringing judgment on the
[39:40] land most of people it'll go right by
[39:42] them and they won't know it it's a word
[39:44] that we use called reprobate when they
[39:47] know us right but yet they still won't
[39:49] do it come on
[39:50] I pray tonight by God's grace that he
[39:53] don't it he would give us mercy just
[39:56] stop and think about it for a while stop
[39:59] and consider our ways and say Lord God
[40:02] what am i doing where am I at dog show
[40:06] me myself guard I need your help how
[40:08] many need God's help tonight but we find
[40:11] that yo I says that it's something about
[40:14] it no man you know know the day nor the
[40:18] hour and that's true but but he did tell
[40:29] us what the season would be like he said
[40:32] as it was in the days of Noah come on as
[40:34] it was in the days of lot he started
[40:37] bringing all these things said you'll
[40:38] see wars and rumors of wars he started
[40:40] letting us know what the season was
[40:42] gonna be like he said when you see these
[40:44] things he says you better look up when
[40:46] you see the fig tree bud and come on you
[40:49] better look up why because your
[40:50] redemption is drawing nigh now's the
[40:53] time you ever want to be serious with
[40:55] God now it's the time to get serious
[40:57] with God give God your Hall at our
[40:59] sister Irene used to sing a song give
[41:01] God all you got and that song still
[41:04] rings in my heart today give God all you
[41:06] got I want to give God all I got it
[41:09] might not be much but give it to God God
[41:11] could do something with it
[41:12] I believe God can do
[41:14] with your life right now where you
[41:16] sitting at you may be sitting at home I
[41:18] don't know you what you may be doing
[41:19] even right now but give God all your God
[41:22] give your life to Jesus
[41:23] whatever you holding your back come on
[41:25] let it go it ain't worth for right now
[41:27] huh this little time that we have here
[41:30] left on earth even if we were to live
[41:32] our full lives out ain't nothing
[41:33] compared to eternity and I believe that
[41:36] he said no man knoweth the day nor the
[41:40] hour come on but he did let us know or
[41:43] what the season you know would be like
[41:46] and we find that I said God is trying to
[41:49] turn our hearts back you know what
[41:51] happened when I like how when Elijah
[41:56] built the altar come on then he began to
[41:59] praying I like how the Bible says that
[42:01] the fire of the Lord fell come on and it
[42:05] consumed everything it consumed the
[42:07] altar consumed this sacrifice it licked
[42:10] up a hold of water I like how it says
[42:12] the window the fire God fell and I pray
[42:16] I said Lord what do we need today Lord
[42:18] we need your fire to fall we could talk
[42:20] about how it was in the days of ho but
[42:22] we need to fire right now just to talk
[42:25] about what happened in the past ain't
[42:27] gonna do us no good right now God we
[42:29] need your fire to fall we need God's
[42:31] fire to fall to consumers I said consume
[42:34] me Lord with the fire of your spirit
[42:36] burn out everything Lord that ain't like
[42:38] you got lit up Oh God all of my sins and
[42:41] transgressions my wicked ways God clean
[42:44] me up somebody out the crowd for the
[42:46] Lord to send the fire back God will send
[42:48] a fire how many believe that I know
[42:50] these I know he will you know
[42:53] it's something about it I says that when
[42:56] their hearts will turn back come on
[43:01] one of the first thing they did when God
[43:03] turned off people heart back he said it
[43:05] gather up the prophets bill
[43:06] don't let him live we're gonna kill him
[43:08] come on he said go go take the idols
[43:11] we're gonna destroy come on
[43:13] God didn't just turn their hearts back
[43:15] and they still just went on with those
[43:17] things temptations and things before
[43:19] them come on but Wingard when their
[43:21] heart stirs turn back first thing they
[43:23] had to do those things that had that had
[43:25] them bound those things they had them
[43:27] call
[43:27] snares they had to deal with him and
[43:29] that's what happens and a lot of times
[43:31] in our lives
[43:32] God would do something special come on
[43:34] God I'll come and deliver you God to
[43:37] heal you save you come on but a lot of
[43:39] times when we get out of those condition
[43:40] we don't deal with the same problem come
[43:42] on let me say this it's not the world
[43:45] doesn't have a political crisis but the
[43:47] world has a sin a sin problem of sin
[43:49] crisis we don't want to deal with them
[43:51] but I want to say tonight let's deal
[43:53] with them come on let's deal with you as
[43:55] an individual let's deal with your life
[43:57] for your condition let's deal with
[43:58] what's holding you back from receiving
[44:00] the Holy Ghost come on he said to repent
[44:03] and be baptized every one of you in the
[44:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ are
[44:06] missing your sins and you shall receive
[44:08] the gift of the Holy Ghost and the
[44:09] promise is unto you and your children
[44:11] it's Adam that afar off come on I said
[44:13] what's holding you back because God is
[44:15] not alive when when you have been
[44:17] baptized buried in his name and rise up
[44:20] God is duty-bound to fill you with the
[44:21] Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy
[44:23] Ghost and what's the problem what's
[44:24] holding you back
[44:25] come on look at your life look at your
[44:27] condition look at everything around
[44:29] you're saying god what is if there's
[44:30] anything
[44:31] Lord holding me back god I want to
[44:33] separate it God because I need you now
[44:35] this thing that's real God I need your
[44:36] blood to cover me god I don't need you
[44:38] just to walk with me but God I need you
[44:40] to be in me and I need to carry you
[44:42] everywhere I go I can't see the forest
[44:44] scene any means I can't see the foreseen
[44:46] dangers God I need your help
[44:48] crowd Lord who are the Lord is still
[44:51] able to be found but we believe that I
[44:54] says you know it's something about it
[44:56] how I said God he loves the cries of his
[45:00] people God he does things and even the
[45:05] scriptures it says that and when my
[45:08] people that are called by my name if
[45:10] they humble themselves and pray come on
[45:12] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[45:14] ways come on you know it's something
[45:17] about the cry you know the earth today
[45:21] just has the world in the days of Noah
[45:23] just has the world in the days of lot
[45:25] cry went out the people's lives and the
[45:29] condition of their lives produced the
[45:31] cry and that cry went to heaven and God
[45:35] heard the cry was so wicked in the day
[45:39] is a lot that God came to
[45:41] himself and he says I got to go see is
[45:44] to cry all together or what we hear it
[45:47] come on I believe today that a cries
[45:50] went up you know each and every one of I
[45:53] into individual lives are producing to
[45:55] cry when when the cry goes up what what
[45:59] is God hearing out of your life come on
[46:02] you might be saying one thing for your
[46:04] mouth or walking in some one thing from
[46:06] out what appearance but when it gets up
[46:08] to heaven what is God hearing come on
[46:10] I pray tonight by the grace of God that
[46:15] the cry that's going up when God hear he
[46:18] hear the cry of a bleating lamb he heard
[46:21] a cry of somebody crying out for mercy
[46:23] come on you remember in the scriptures
[46:25] he said to mark knows that side cry for
[46:28] the abominations that's done in a scene
[46:30] come on if we ever needed a side cry now
[46:33] it's the time to sign cry
[46:35] let us bow heavily father Lord we thank
[46:39] you O God turn us back Lord I believe it
[46:45] right now you don't have to be here
[46:48] tonight but wherever you are I believe
[46:51] God is calling you back he said let
[46:55] every man examine himself are you
[46:57] examining yourself tonight are you
[47:01] checking out are you letting the Lord
[47:03] come in and clean out every room come on
[47:06] I said examine yourself turn back from
[47:10] your wicked ways turn back to God you've
[47:14] been doing a lot of lip service you've
[47:16] been doing a lot of outward appealing
[47:18] appearances and we're all guilty of it
[47:21] but it's the time now as Paul said you
[47:25] got to die daily today yesterday we must
[47:29] doubt ourselves down our old sinful ways
