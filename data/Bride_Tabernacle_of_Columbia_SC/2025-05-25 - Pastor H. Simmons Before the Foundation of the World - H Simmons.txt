I got a little excited because I don't know whether we praise God enough for his goodness. And uh you know sometimes we we you work things up in emotionalism, but sometimes you got to think about how good God is to you and what he's done for you and what he's doing for you. And it causes you to worship him. It causes you to praise him and thank him. Praise God. [Music] says here, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with what?

He chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love and having predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will.

Because he chose me. Not only did he choose me now, but he chose me. Amen. Before the foundation of the world. Amen. Before the world was ever made, God chose me before the foundation of the world. I wonder how the Ephesian church felt. Amen. When they when they heard this message that you have been chosen in him before the foundation of the world. I wonder how they felt. Yeah. You hearing something that Amen. You just human beings, just regular people, and all of a sudden, Amen. You had an experience with God. Amen. You you you've accepted the Lord. And Amen. you were in church worshiping and and you hear me such as he chose you in him before the foundation of the world. It was no accident that you hear. It's no accident that you saved. God.

Isaiah 46. Amen. He chose me. Praise God. Out of all the mistakes and all the mess that we've got ourselves in, all the trouble and all the different things that happened to us in our lives, yet God, amen, had a purpose and a plan. Yet, Amen. We can look back and said, "I don't deserve," Amen. God's goodness. Amen. I don't deserve God. Amen. Praise God. A God that chose me. What did I do to deserve it? Why did he choose me? Amen. Look at me. Praise God. Sometimes we look at our lives and we were in bad shape. We Amen. We can look at our lives, we were I mean wasn't worthy. Amen. But God made us worthy. Amen. Because he knew, Amen. that it was something something down in the inside. There was a desire there. Amen. Amen. There was a deep calling to the deep. It doesn't matter. Amen. how we went astray and how we wanted in life that's something about God. There was something down deep. Amen. A deep call into the deep. Amen. Amen. We try. Amen. Uh there was a thirst that we could not quench. Amen. Amen. We were thirsting after God. Why? Because God before the foundation of the world saw that you needed him and that you wanted him. You desire him. Amen. God saw that in his mind. Amen. Amen. God knew. Amen. His thoughts. Jesus. Amen. Concerning you. Amen. Amen. God. Amen. When he thought, Amen. He didn't have to rethink. Praise God. When he thought about you, he didn't have to re-evaluate. Maybe I I thought wrong. When God thought about you, he didn't think wrong. Amen. And he didn't have to rethink himself. Amen. Amen. You might have wondered and Amen. You went some uh crooked ways and did some stuff. Amen. That you may have thought God made a mistake. Praise God. But God didn't make a mistake. Amen. When he chose you in him before the foundation of the world. Look at a man like Saul persecuting the church. Amen. Praise God. A man that was putting people in jail because, amen, they were Christians. Because they were followers of Jesus. A man that did not believe. Amen. That Jesus was the Messiah. A man that persecuted the way. Amen. This man was chosen. He put the pen in the writing. Amen. and you has he chosen. Amen. Praise God. Before the foundation of the world. That means Saul of Tarsus that the church world feared because this man Amen. Amen. Whether it's men or women, I'm putting him in jail. Amen. Amen. Yet a light shine from heaven and saw that Paul in his heart. Amen. Amen. desired to do the right thing. Amen. Amen. But he was wrong. Amen. Because he went to church where they taught against the sweet way. Amen. He was born in the Pharisee religion. Amen. Amen. And he stuck with this uh after a thinking in the way. Amen. He been born up, but yet Amen. God saw his heart. Amen. God saw that he Amen. had been chosen in him before the foundation of the world. Amen. So God begin to allow Amen. He's mine. God can find you, can he? Amen. Amen. Even when you going against the grain, you coming against God's people. But God found him. Amen. The one that you think came in is against you, God. Amen. Might have a plan for them. Amen. Amen. The one that you think, Amen. Saul on his way down to Damascus to persecute the church. The Bible said, "Let the light shine from heaven and said, Amen. And he fell to the earth." He said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou what?" Me. Amen. He wasn't doing it to uh Amen. God because God is a spirit. He was doing it to God's people. So God identified himself. That's right. Amen. Amen. That you were persecuting me. Because God was in those people. Amen. Amen. God, they were a part of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. A part of God. God said, "Why perse?" And he said to the Lord, he said, "Who are thou?" He recognized that I don't know you. Amen. Amen. I I I I I'm a study of the scripture. Amen. I'm a Bible believer yet I don't know you. But this supernatural happened. And I said, "Who are you, Lord? I know it's the Lord." Amen. But he said, "Who art thou?" Cuz he said, "Who? Why persecute thou me?" So he said, "Well, this is strange. I know this is the supernatural happening. I know the spill of fire and I know this is God, but he said, "Why persecute me?" So the question, what? Well, I'm persecuting them and I know I'm I'm supposed to believe in one God. And I know that you are God, but you said I'm persecuting you. Are you with me? And he said, I am what? Jesus. I'm Jesus. Amen. This was a great thing because all the time they had the law, they had the letter, they were serving under the law, but amen disposessions have changed. Grace had come on the sin. Amen. That's right. Amen. But they were still Amen. blinded, amen, to Jesus and his coming. He their eyes were blinded. Even when they read the scriptures, they still was blinded. Amen. Some people go to church. Amen.
