heart lord speak to every need lord touch everyone even in their absence lord touch those that are watching lord touch those that hear the word lord jesus we ask you bless this place and lord bless everyone that's here in jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles this morning ask that you turn to the book of first peter look of first peter chapter 2. when you got it saved man first peter chapter two we'll start in verse wherefore laying aside all malice and all god and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby it so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a a living stone disallowed indeed of man but chosen of god and precious ye also as a lively stoner built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ amen you may be seated amen this morning i'd like to speak on a little thought i entitled i did called step by step step by step and uh the lord was dealing with me through it some different things and i said in life there's always steps that you have to take there's always steps that you go through things that allow you to progress forward and i wrote something down i said with say for example before you can run you gotta walk before you walk you gotta crawl but and at this time in the scripture it says here as newborn babes desire to sincere nickel the word that you may grow thereby amen it has to be a process of maturity it has to be a process where you're taking steps to go somewhere you're going up or you're going down but you're going somewhere you're not staying still amen so you want to be taking steps you don't want to stay a baby for forever you want to grow and and just saying that the lord places on my heart that i got to be taking steps in the right direction you can be taking steps but headed in the wrong direction you could be taking steps and think that you're going up but you're going down it may look good on the outside but it may be rotten on the inside because something always it takes steps to grow when you look at a tree there's there's elements that cause that tree to grow it has to have sun it has to have water and it has to have a source of life it has to have these things to grow so there are steps that it takes even and even with the season cause it to grow the seasons help help the tree to grow and it's a step-by-step process i wrote something down i said don't rush the process many times we try to jump from here jump from there when god taking us through to build character in us they said i heard someone say the one thing that you that you had that you take out of this light that you didn't bring in it was your character and god is using certain things to build character in you i said just like before you go to heaven you have to be you have to repent and then you have to you have to be baptized and then you got to be filled with the holy ghost so there are steps that you got to go through and even though you might not be in in the in the third step you might be in the first step but there's a step that you got to do to come to god there's a step that you got to go through to come to god and he said and he said the only way we're going to make it is step by step because change doesn't happen overnight god can do things in your life to change situations god can do things in your life to work it out but god has a way that you got to come you can't come any way that you decide to come but he said straight is the way the straight is the gate and narrow is the way amen because god is trying to prove something to you it said you can you can be taking steps but going in the wrong direction direction i want to ask you the question this morning are you headed in the right direction are you headed in the right direction i think of some stories in the bible and you can look at it but jonah god told him to go to nineveh but jonah decided i'm gonna go my own way now he ended up in nineveh anyways but he went his own way and he had to suffer for it he had to go through some trials and tribulations because he had to suffer for going his own way so you got to choose which way you want to go you got to choose whether you want to go through hardships and headaches and heartaches instead of just listening to god when he calling calling you and on your life you got to say lord i want i want to go do this thing but you know every decision that you make has consequences every decision step that you make is going to take you in a in a direction whether it's up or whether it's down so you take a step if i step from the ground up to here i moved if i come down and i step down i moved that means that something happened something transpired it happened within me i had to take a step i moved to my right i moved to my left at something i wasn't standing still and you're never standing still even when you think you're standing still you're never standing still even when you think i'm solid god has a way of always moving you because he expects growth he said i wouldn't you be hot or cold because if you're lukewarm i swear you out of my mouth so god wants you to be something he wants you to be doing something he wants you to be moving he wants you something to be transpiring within you see jonah he decided i'm going to do my own thing he said i'm going to get on this ship and i'm going to go far away from where god see i'm going to go far away but he got on that ship and stormed and a storm came up and the people on the ship they recognized this ain't no normal storm this ain't no normal thing that we we don't been through storms before we season stay sailors this not no normal storm he they said something something something wrong on this ship something something ain't right over here i got to check we got to check out and see who this is we got to check out and see what's wrong because this group of people that i'm with something wrong here i haven't been through storms before but some somebody here ain't supposed to be here somebody in this group that ain't supposed to be in this group so we gotta find out who it is so they cast lots on that ship and they said and they looked at it and the cash locks and it came up and they said it was jonah now jonah was sleeping and they said well you know we don't want to blame nobody so we going to lighten this and see if we can make it we don't want to point no fingers yet we want to lighten the ship but after lightening the ship it didn't help after unloading all these burdens it didn't help they lost all the cargo it didn't help so they said we got to go approach this person and say and jonah said it's me he recognized that god was trying to get his attention he recognized that something it's me it's not them it's me and he focused on it he said well y'all throw me overboard i'll be all right and they threw him overboard and then god sent a big fish to take him but in that fish body he got down there and he got on his knees and he got to praying he got down and he said lord i need i need to step in the right direction i need to take a step in the right direction lord because i'm supposed to be in a different place you sent me somewhere now i got to go by your way when i could have just went by my own choice but god took him through trials and tribulations to get him where he wanted to be and saying that you don't have to go through the trials and tribulations you can just choose the right direction you can take steps in the right path and god can place you and take you further than you ever thought you want to go i said if you look in the book of acts chapter eight here acts chapter eight and there's there's a person another person in the bible that you can look at and his name was saul later he became paul but saul is where i want to talk about it and saul was a very learned man he was well taught he learned under the best of the best a brilliant person and and in acts chapter 8 verse 1. and it says saul he was here and he says and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the region regions of judea and samaria except the apostles and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation as for saul he make havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committing them to prison she saw at this point of time he thought he was doing god's will he thought he was headed in the right direction he thought i'm i'm going up i'm doing what i'm supposed to do because these people aren't right they're not living by the laws that we say they got this different doctrine but then if you skip over the chapter 9 and in chapter 9 verse 1 and it says in saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogue that if he found of any of this way whether there were men or women he might bring them bound into jerusalem and as he turned he came near damascus and suddenly to shine round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me see i asked the question back to you are you heading in the right direction because paul thought he was when he was persecuting the christians he listened to those that was around him and said this is what you need to do but are you listening to god are you listening to the folks around you and say this is the way we should do it or god is trying to lead you in another direction a god is trying to take you on another path that's going to lead you higher that's going to lead you to growth that's going to lead you to blessings or you're trying to go your own way see saul thought he said i'm doing right but god said here in verse 4 he said saul saul why persecute it's not me see he was persecuting the ones that god loved the ones that he had or named and he said in verse 5 and who out thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom not persecuted it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks see saul didn't have to wonder who it was that was calling his name he knew who it was he i'm sure he may have heard this before but he said lord who out there lord he said i am jesus whom thou persecuted it is hard for thee to kick kick and print against the prick and he trembling and astonish said lord what would thou have me to do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou thou must do she saw he realized that he needed to take steps he needed to take some steps in the right direction he needed to change the path that he was going so that he can honor god so and i said before you go to hell you must take steps to go there before you get to the to the steps of heaven you have to take steps to go there you have to bash bypass all god's ways of salvation all the time that god was knocking on your door to get your attention you got to bypass that and say i don't want it see god it's not going to when you get to heaven it's not going to be this judgment it said you're going to judge yourself you're going to look at because there are going to be many opportunities that god placed in your life and gave you chances to get right many opportunities he asked you to take a step in the right direction he asked you to take the step towards me and he would give you rest he'd make you make your burdens light amen but he said that before you go to hell you must take steps to go there you must reject god's word and his path for salvation just think of luke 18 where there was the young rich ruler he took steps he thought he was successful he had money he was a ruler he was a powerful person maybe he thought i could get this money to maybe help people i can get this status and maybe i can do this for somebody or do this for someone but god said god asked him he said he asked him what have you done he said i've served all the commandments since my youth i think he was a godly person well the lord said you got one thing to sell all you have and give it to the poor and because of all his statuses and things that he thought he was going gonna lose he said i i i i'm good he he took steps in the wrong direction that was a moment for him to take a step in the right direction but he decided that no i'm good i i i i'm i'm stable where i am but he didn't realize that that stable where he was was taking him in the wrong direction he didn't realize that maybe he went further he might have been good up to that point but he might be going downhill after that he didn't know that those steps could be going down instead of he thought they were going up and he says he said that jesus said no man cometh unto the father but by me see god has a way that you have to go god has the way that you can't get under see god has a way that you can't get over and you can't go around it you must come in at the door amen said how are you going to make it to heaven by skipping steps or using your own process how are you going to make it to heaven by skipping steps or using your own process how are you going to make it by doing your own thing how you gonna make it believing that i i'm right and what i say and he won't listen to no one how are you gonna make it how are you gonna make it when you being disobedient how are you gonna make it when you ignoring the advice of people that god doesn't sit in your life to speak to you tell me how you gonna make it when god is using things to speak to you each and every day he using things to get your attention but you ignoring it because you say i don't want to do that right now i'm going to do my life i'm going to do my thing i'm going to live the way that i want to live and then once i get done living i'm going to be able to do i'm going to come back to the lord but what if you ain't got that time i've been going to almost funerals every single week for the last month what if you don't have that time young and old but you decide now i'm gonna take steps well each step is taking you in a direction what direction do you want to go and just because i i wrote something else down just because you are taking all the right steps don't mean that trouble won't come it don't mean that trouble not gonna come in your life sometimes god put trouble to get you closer to speed you up on them steps and sometimes we're taking the steps and we're going slow and god said i need i need to speed you up a little bit so he'll send something in your way to get you i think of the story of job job he did everything right and god still tested him god still tried him took everything from him that he could take except for his life then god and he said just because you may you may be taking all the right steps don't mean that god that god that you won't face it but it does mean that you have confidence that god can bring you through that god can bring you out of all your troubles that you may face in life that god can hold your hand and take you through through all those trials and tribulations because you made the steps in the right direction that don't mean that just because you're making steps that the steps won't be steep that they won't be an uphill climb but he said that i can lead you and i can guide you along the way lord if you walk amen so god can always grab your hand and pull you on through god can always reach now when he know that you're weak you're weary you're wanting and say i'm gonna pick up my child and carry them on through i'm gonna pick them up because i see they trying i see they giving an effort i see that they they working on and they working hard and i see that they've given me their all right and when you meet when you give god 100 he can give you some more he can enlarge your vessel to receive more he can make your cup run over sometimes when your cup get full you say i want some more and god can allow your cup to run over because surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in his presence for forever see god can give you more than anything out here anything in the world but you got to be making steps in the right direction you got to be progressing to where god wants you to be not where you want to be because that can be different from where god wants you to be in philippians it says i press towards the my for the prize of the high calling amen so you got to be moving you got to be doing something going in the right direction not the wrong direction and in psalms it says the steps of the good man are ordered by the lord see it's steps that god wants you to take each and every day the prophet of god said to grow closer to him you read your bible and you pray every single day see there's steps that you got to be taking don't get satisfied where you are don't get satisfied and say um even for the one that's not that's not living right in the one that is don't get satisfied with where you are because we all should be growing we all should be taking steps in the right direction we all should be progressing each and every day we all got some room that we need room for improvement we all got room for improvement each and every day ain't none of us in here perfect but god is always worth it and he gave us everything that we needed to make it in so my life may not be your life and my testimony may not be your testimony but it doesn't mean that god ain't done something for me it doesn't mean that god ain't causing me to and pointed me in the right direction that'll mean that god ain't showing me every day that you know yesterday i took a step back but today i'm going to take a step forward doesn't mean that yesterday i didn't stumble and fall but today i can make the right decision to go forward i can make the right decision to step forward i can make the right decision to go on the right path that god has placed in my life see these steps that you're gonna take they gonna be hard sometimes you're gonna have to leave some people along the way you're gonna have to step away from some friends from some family sometimes separate yourself and from from these things that you're going through and these people that's around you because they may not be helping you on your journey they may not be encouraging you on your journey they discouraging you like joel friends they said why don't you just curse your god and die like job wife said curse your god and die but job said no because he's always been there for me he always kept me even in my lowest moment he still kept me even when i was down and out god still kept me and joe continued to make steps in the right direction what happened to job he got double what he lost he got double everything that he lost god restored it tenfold god decided that you know what that's that's a man that always made steps in the right direction no matter what you placed in front of him he still made steps in the right direction no matter what was taken from him he still made steps in the right direction when he lost his his wealth when he lost his family when he lost his friends he still was making steps in the right direction when he was feeble and didn't have much help he still was making steps in the right direction even when he was down and out he still was making steps in the right direction and and he said that the prophet of god said said he he said then i heard something like onward christian soldier i looked here and here come that saintly bunch of of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down on their back smooth clean marching like this the steps of the gospel she was the word they looked like one out of every nation i was looking as it was as they passed by and seeing them pass by instead of going down they were going up and i noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying getting out of line i screamed stay in line and the vision left me and i was standing in the room screaming stay in line and stay in line see that's what god wants you to stay in line and keep marching forward keep marching forward because when you stumble someone stumbles behind you when you stumble and when in those formations in the army when you stumble someone trips over your foot so god wants you to keep pressing forward because someone's always watching someone always paying attention to how you live in your life and if you profess that i i am a christian and then they seek you not living godly then what does that show them what what does that show them which direction are you going it shows them which direction of you you going so one of the best testimonies that you can live is the life that you live people may not see you talk about god they may not see you preach the word to them they may not see you quote scriptures but they are watching your life they watching how you live your life and if you say that i am a christian then they expect certain things from you god expects certain things from you if you say that i believe your word in all of your word then how am i supposed to conduct my life how what steps am i making in the right direction what steps am i doing to show forth that god you are still god you're able to keep me you're able to help me you're able to strengthen me you're able to watch over me and protect me each and every day and so you got to be making steps in the right direction you got to be going forward and allowing god to show forth that i am god through you because sometimes the best the best testimony that you got is the one that you live the one that you live each and every day people may not say that that that's that's the person but they know that you're different they will tell you that you are different they will bypass adding you to certain things by the way that you live they will bypass saying inviting you to certain places because of the way that you live and they don't even know you they could just see you and say i'm gonna skip that person i've had that happen i was sitting in a place one time and people were getting invited to this gathering and i noticed the person behind me got an invite the person in front of me got an invite the person over there got an invite and i felt left out i said how i didn't get one but god knew that i didn't need to be there and they knew that i wasn't a part of it they had never seen the person never knew the person but they knew that god was making sure that i was continuing to make steps in the right direction and just because you feel like you are left out that don't mean that you are left out that may be god protection over your life causing you not to go in the wrong direction that may be god watching over you saying that i'm not going to let you go there cause something might bad might happen there see god always has a way to keep you in line with the steps and where he wants you to go god always has a way in keeping you in line with the direction that he wants you to go so are you following his steps and and keep going in the right direction see when you think that that you are being left out that could be god protection over your life that can be god keeping you away from situations keeping you away from circumstances because he knows that if you get there you're going to do something that you shouldn't do because a lot of times a lot of your influence is by who you are around you wouldn't do certain things if you weren't in certain atmospheres that's why you have the ability to change the atmosphere you have the ability to walk into a place and change it because god knows if he puts you in certain places every man is weak every man will fall because that's our nature we come from a fallen state but only god can keep us only god can keep us going in the right direction only the good hand of the lord can keep us going in the right direction and taking steps in the right direction so you can't rush the process of what god is doing in your life and you got to put your life in the lord's hands and say lord lead me in the right direction lord help me to make the right steps lord help me to grow each and every day to grow stronger because lord i don't want to be a babe all my life i don't want to be a babe just sucking on milk lord i want to eat meat one day lord i want to be able to taste the good things of god not just the little things lord the good things of god i want to sit at the feast of the master's table said lord i want to thank you for helping me make it over lord i want to make the right decisions to step forward and say lord take me on lord continue to let me go up and not down lord i want to step in the right direction because lord you are the one that can keep me going when i'm weak when i'm weary when i'm warned lord you can keep me going you can give me strength lord you can send someone by me to speak to me and my needs lord you can send someone that lord i'm going through but i need something from you lord lord i don't want this opportunity to pass without me taking a step in the right direction each and every day you taking a step each and every morning that you wake up one of my friends he used to tell me he said that every day that i wake up mean that god ain't done with me yet every day that you wake up means that god is not finished with you yet there's something else he wants you to do there's something else that he wants you to accomplish so he gives us opportunity each and every day to come to him to repent to come to him and say lord i'm sorry to come to him and say lord continue creating me a clean heart there's david he went through different things in life but he said lord created me a clean heart because he knew that he wasn't perfect he knew that he wasn't worth it but god still had grace and mercy and even came to the end and said that's a man after my own heart that's a man that even though he stumbled and he fell he always was stepping in the right direction he always was taking a step in the right direction he always was pushing forward even though he may have stumbled and he still he fell he got down on his knees and he repented see god always gives us he always gives us a way of escape he always gives us an opportunity and he put forth the path and steps that we should go in order to make it in because what is the point of living this life to go to hell what is the point of living this life and and to go to the lake of fire what what what are you living for what direction are you going in and action says and then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost see that was a step by step process first you have to repent and repent means to be godly sorry it don't mean to get down and and do the same say lord i'm sorry and do the same thing over and over and over again now god said he's willing to forgive you but at some point in time you got to grow you got to start taking steps in the right direction you got to overcome something otherwise you you would continue to go around the same mountain over and over and over just like the children of israel eventually i want to cross over to the promised land i don't want to be here for forever lord i want to cross over and get all your blessings not just men are from on heaven i want to go where the land is flowing with milk and honey where where where where we bringing back all the spoils and the riches of our enemies because we've grown to the point that god can give us greater victories not just the small things the great things in god and see first you got to repent then you got to be baptized and then you you want to get to the to a point that lord you filled me with your with your spirit every single day i can hear your voice i can have you walking beside me leading and guiding me and helping me to take the steps on this journey because each and every step i need jesus to lift me up each and every steps i need the lord to walk with me lord each and every day lord walk with me lord because i can't take a step without you give me the strength to take the step i can't go forward unless you give me the strength to go forward i can't do anything unless you are there giving it to me lord jesus see there's so many things that we think that we can we can do because we may be young we may be strong but god always has a way of showing us that he he is the one that gives you strength he's the one that that gives you strength you can lose your strength overnight just get struck with sickness you can lose you can lose what you think is the thing that makes you strong overnight god can just take that away from you just look at samson god god gave him a gift and when he cut his hair well guess what he couldn't have that strength no more but he spent the rest of his life taking steps to go in the right direction after they plucked out his eyes he realized where his strength came from he realized that this is not my ability this is god that gave me this ability and he took the rest of his life he said lord and then with my last breath i want to give you everything you don't have to wait to your last breath to decide that you want to give god everything you can do that way before that so god can use you throughout your life not when you get to the end of the road and say lord i'm sorry lord forgive me and that's it god wanted to use you way more than you wanted to be used but you got to take steps in the right direction and they said after sampson that day when he pushed down the pillars his last day he said he killed more that day than he did his whole entire life see god wants to use you in greater ways god could have used him even more mightily if he had taken steps in the right direction if he had taken steps and avoided some situations had avoided some people so avoided some places god could have done some things in his life even more that he ever thought it would be accomplished see but you got to always be taking steps in the right direction you got to be pressing forward you got to be pushing forward you got to allow god to use you and work through you and don't ignore the steps that god is placing in front of you don't ignore because some sometimes the best way is through something it's not around it it's not over it's through it because god want to teach you a lesson god want to build some character in you he want to allow you to grow he wants you to go in the right direction he wants you to go in the right direction don't avoid that step because that was the step that was going to take you in the right direction this he said many times you get to a stairway and there's multiple stairs you get to escalate and there's two there's one going up and there's one going down so some fight the hard way they go on the elevator going down trying to go up it's almost like fighting a losing battle because each time you take a step up it's going down each time you take a step up it's going down but if you're going in the right direction you can you can it's easier to go up here because as you step up it goes up as you step up and that's just like god when you're on in the right direction he pulling he pulling those steps and he pulling you forward and you're going in the right direction you got to fight every step of the way you got to fight to go up you got to fight but god can is able to pull you on through he's able to take you that way but that was by choice you got a choice to make that you can go in the right direction or you can go in the wrong direction but that choice is up to you that choice is up to you i can't make that decision for you i can't make you grow i can't make you go in the right direction you got to choose what direction you want to go you got to choose which way that you want to go because god is putting forth a choice to you each and every day that you wake up god put forth a choice to you and which direction do you want to go you get to make that choice god gave you the ability to make that choice but you gotta decide which direction you want to go what steps you want to take do you want to go up or do you want to go down which steps do you want to go on because god has made a way that you can escape you can escape the wrath to come the world isn't getting any better each and every day you see the prices of things and you wonder how in the world are you going to be aching make it as you get paid more things go up more the more the more you look at it's like you on the same level but god has a way of making everything right he has a way to show you that this world is not your home you just a traveler passing through amen because god has a way of helping you take the right steps in the right direction amen [Applause] step by step amen you appreciate the word this morning amen thank the lord for our brother caleb and him pouring out his heart amen and i just said a lot of things he said was it's kind of golden like how he says how you going to make it doing it your own way you know i thought about one guy at work a young guy he told me i don't believe that if to get to heaven if there is a god you got to live a certain way or do certain things or he ain't gonna let you in he says i don't think that's right i asked him i said well would you tell god that he said yes if he don't let me and i'll tell him that i said well good luck with that because that that's what they do right man got it in his own mind that he gonna tell god what to do but it don't work like that do it come on i says you know one thing brother caleb was talking about how things can change so quick i was thinking about uh last night i was telling my in-laws i didn't plan for all this this weekend you know uh thursday i had a had a little notch start coming up in the middle of my forehead and i thought it was like a pimple or bump or something but by friday all that was swole up and it started pushing over into my eye i woke up saturday morning couldn't open my right eye and i was trying to close my left eye so i went to the doctor and uh they was thinking it might have been an insect bite but then uh he says we need to cut it out right now so i wasn't planning for that but it gave me shots and when he went to cut it out he realized it wasn't an insect but he said it was a some type of i forgot what they call it satis cysts or something like that but um he was saying if it don't come all the way out you got to go get it surgically removed so i was praying yesterday i said god i need you to do your own operation you know so you know but i thank god that you know we've been blessing them most of the swelling went down i mean it might look still look bad now but god is on the move still but i said the thing is i was thinking about brother caleb says you know about planning you can have plans but god can alter them plans you know you can have things planned out but you wake up tomorrow and god don't alter your whole plans you know you see how how quickly things can change i was up me and my wife was up last night and all of a sudden the whole house started shaking it didn't last long but the whole house shook sound like thunder first thing i said that's an earthquake and that was it was gave you an eerie feeling because i said you know what happens we go on about our own business doing our own thing you know ain't concerned about our soul at all oh i got time and all that but you don't know at any time god can change things at any time plans can be over with i mean any without warning those things happen without warning you know like hurricanes you see them coming all that but earthquakes you don't see earthquakes coming i said god god can alter your plan at any time can it so why not be right with god at all times that if he come get you right now you say lord i i've done all i can do i've done all you asked me to do i'm ready right now that's how quickly things can change you know a lot of times things happen you say we get warned warning does come before judgment god warning you right now with the word that he spoke this morning ain't it he warning you every time you hear that preacher get up in the pulpit and call and ask you to give your life to god he's warning you right then ain't it on that day of judgment just like my brother caleb was saying you god ain't gonna have to judge you you'll judge yourself by the life that you live it won't be nothing new you're here but you'll hear that same voice that you heard this morning that same voice you heard every every sunday morning every friday calling out asking you to do what like my brother was saying this morning repent come on and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now why didn't you do it come on that'll be the thing why you didn't do it because at any time things can change can it come on i said you know a lot of times you know we look at uh things and like you said that you're gonna have time but things happen in like with the disciples they said we thought elias must first come and he said he already came but you didn't know who he was come on and those things what happened things just as it was in that day things are passed right by you you won't even know it the prophet of god talked about after the rapture take place people are still be giving their life to the god still claiming god filled them with the holy ghost menace will still be preaching the gospel and all going on and they won't even know that the holy ghost has done lifted off the earth and he doesn't turn back to the jews they won't even know that but i want to say today i don't know about you but i want to be ready at all times amen do you want to be ready i said see how quickly things can change you can have plans but god alter your plans come on so i said lord we came out of prayer yesterday me and my wife and was praying and it came in my spirit the trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to your own understanding but in all of your ways acknowledge him and he gonna direct your paths and that's in the times where you don't understand and the times you don't know what's going on with you he says trust in me and i'ma direct your past he says acknowledge him now in all your ways and he gonna direct them i began to pray i said lord i want you to leave me god guide me don't let my eyes lead me don't let my wants and the will of his flesh the desires of his flesh to leave me because you know those things will lead you you know i believe jeremiah said the heart is a seafood and wicked and he said full of wickedness and just paraphrasing they said who can know it your own heart will deceive you that's why god wants to give you a new heart not the heart of this world but god wants to give you something new and that's the thing about it uh sometimes we say well how we gonna we we got to quit trying to figure out how we gonna live it and just give it to god and allow his spirit to come in and live his life through you trying to figure out how i'm gonna get this accomplished how i'm gonna do that you got to learn how to let go and let god come in your life and do it learn how to get out of god's way and say lord here here it is lord you take over take my will lord and and mold it come on take my mind like this little song says and and transform it to yours because that's what god wants to do how many believe that this morning i says the thing is we can have goals ambitions things that we doing things we want to get done all these things but we neglect the things of the lord we neglect your soul your that prayer life that time with god you neglect those things and then when god called you'll be weighed in the balance and found one you ain't got enough to make it over you ain't got enough all to make it through the night come on because we headed in some dark nights ain't we demon powers lurking all over the place coming from all over us i was looking at the other day and they when they uh reversed the whole abortion thing and now the people just went crazy because they telling you not to kill your children come on telling you to preserve life don't kill that child people going crazy because they want to kill the children say that ain't what they want that that's harsh come on but that's what it is come on y'all believe that this morning world gone insane come on the bible talked about as it was in the days of noah we know that in those days men's heart was on wickedness wasn't it evil continually come on until the day that god took no into the heart but i say today i believe there's still light y'all believe that this morning come on oh god it's so good ain't it step by step that's what it is you go i know you ain't gonna run it all in one race one stroke come on step by step god wants to take you how many want to take the right steps this morning come on god has put you on a path amen y'all continue praying for me i i thank god i woke up this morning i i didn't i said man i didn't know what was gonna happen i woke up today and i could see out of both of my eyes now so i said lord thank you amen and well god is so good amen and you know the devil put all kind of things in your mind you got a brain tumor you about to go all those stuff but you know what though i said god my life is in your hands the devil can't do nothing except for what you allow and if god allow it then i'm fine with it come on i said whatever god ordered that's the way i want it i just want to make sure my soul is right and that's what count the most are you is your soul right this morning come on we don't have time i mean you don't you don't have time to play with your soul come on you don't have time to play a round with the devil come on i was thinking about a little situation you know not long ago and i said that person made a deal with the devil they didn't know you can't win making the deal with the devil and he requiring your soul come on but i says the thing is when you make a deal with the devil come on what you think gonna come out of it that's what's gonna come out of it sooner or later but god is beckoning you come on come on you without money come on what he says without money without price come on i want to give you salvation for free i want to give you the land i want to give you the kingdom all i want you to do is come and worship me that's all i want come on all i want you to do is tell me all i want you to do is say lord thank you all i want you to do is praise me and get out the way and let me have my way in your life that's all god wants come on how many want to give god what he wants ain't he worthy come on oh hallelujah let us bow this morning thank you lord we thank you for our brother caleb this morning
