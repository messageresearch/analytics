the Holy Ghost God coming out miss God and break the bread of life give us what we stand in need of Lord we can't do it on our own so god we're dependent on you thank you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray man God is good amen we want to look at the book of 1st Corinthians about God's grace first Corinthians 1st Corinthians 1 1 first Corinthians 1 and we'll begin at the tempers first Corinthians one and ten and it reads now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you speak all the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind in the same judgment so it have been declared unto me of you my brother in' by then which are the household of Chloe that there are contentions among you now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul and I am Apollo's and I am Cephas and I am Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius lest any should say that I had that I had baptized in mine own name and I baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with the wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ shall be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing to understand another prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world have not God made the foolish have not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that and wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek out the wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block and until the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how there many not wise men after the flesh not many my not many know more called but God have chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God have chosen the weak things of the world to confine the things which are mighty and base things of the world and the things which are despised hath God chosen yay and the things which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord may God add the blessed arena of his word tonight by God's grace I just want to minister to you for a moment and I entitled the sermon tonight foolishness amen foolishness no you know I like how you know Paul you know here here one thing he always was doing was breaking down about the power of God he kept talking about you know the power he kept saying what you think is his foolishness that's the thing guard has used to save us and we drawing power from it he says I didn't come just to preach to you just the wisdom of men's words but I come to preach to you in one place he's saying demonstration in power and that's what I believe a lot of times we we fail to see or we fail to to demonstrate even in the ministry is the power of God he said if I just came to you just in word only I made what Christ done all that just none of thing he says but you know to them that believe to those that don't believe it's a stumbling block but to you that believe it is the power so we find that you know even within ourselves you know God can't do nothing for you unless you believe first unless you believe but your belief or what you believe and what God and what God promised you you can drop I mean produced the power that's in the word so you know I was I was talking with a Muslim guy one night at work and he was saying you know if he was saying I don't know why you Christians you know believe that you know you getting baptized and just believing on Jesus that you'll be saved where do you where do you get that and I said the thing is you know I said God can only Jesus can only do for you if you believe in him I said even in his hole even in his own home when he was young growing up even in his own home when he came to preach he couldn't do many miracles there because the people didn't believe I said but to those that believed you know it's not just what we talked about what we heard but we've experienced the power of God and I said that same power that we've experienced you it's available to for you to experience but you got to first believe and I think God and that's what God has to do sometimes get us to the place to get us in to that point to where we believe so we know that like we said Paul kept dictating to the people or kept making emphasis on not just in the wisdom but in the power but one thing that he was showing the people that a lot of times you looking for God but you're looking for him in the wrong places you're looking for him in intellectualism you're looking for him in knowledge and wisdom you're looking for him in the biggest churches what God might not be in the biggest churches he said God always used the small things the foolish things and and that's where you'll find God and I thank God I says because what God has to do sometimes is is bring us back I believe to that childlike faith to that place the way we can just start taking guard and his word again just for what he says because I don't know about you but we at that place we at that time or that cycle I believe in time where we're gonna have to know more than just intellectualism more than just a good sermon wisdom but she's gonna have to be a demonstrator of the power and it's not that you demonstrate MIT but its Christ in you that's demonstrating the power so that's what the the ministry always does to try to point individuals into a personal experience with Christ that you can't go off my experience I can't go off your experience but you got to have an individual a relationship with God you got to know God for yourself because it'll show sooner or later it'll show up sooner or later further down the road is trials and tribulations call me to show just what type of each experience you had whether you was going off somebody else experienced or whether you received an experience for yourself so we look at here we're talking about foolishness I say the thing about it was here in the scriptures you can look and I believe Paul even had to deal with with these things that that you know man always stole I believe that he could outsmart God or either he thought that he didn't think he could outsmart him he thought that maybe in some cycles of time he didn't have the need of God because of his status in life for just how well he's doing but God knows and what God does a lot of times he has to break us back down and break us down to that to the place to where we come back to that understanding that we can't do nothing without God that we're only living and breathing is because he loud if he didn't allow these things then we wouldn't be able to be in the position or be in the place that we are tonight we're only here because of God is what God allowed so a lot of times he brings us I believe back to that place and I said and that's no matter you know how how you you are and how mighty you are God knows just what it takes to break you down God knows just what it takes they get you back on your knees again for say God knows he knows what it takes you know what I said a lot of times what he'll do he does those things because Oh all God won't out of each and every one of our lives it's for us to give him the glory foster to acknowledge him you know how much we go throughout the day without acknowledging Jesus Christ without acknowledging and and ensuring forth thankfulness you know in the scriptures if we could have read ahead in the scriptures Paul talked about how faithful God was he said God you know it's faithful in all things and that's what a lot of times we don't acknowledge we don't acknowledge that so what God he does sometimes it doesn't matter like I said how hard you are how mighty or God knows how to break you down God you know I think about Nebuchadnezzar and his condition and how God you know just allowing him to go in and he even called Nebuchadnezzar his servant at once how he went and brought judgment upon the nations of the earth but the Bible talked about a time that even in that when he was walking in and out viewing his kingdom and how he began to look and say look what I've done but God had already warned him that hey you know sooner or later you gonna get lifted up and he tried to warn them before he even got to that point but it is in a man we can get caught up sometimes and that's what God does guards tries to warn us many times let's get ready to come up the road he tries to warn us sometimes he put things before us that stop us before we go too far but what happens is many of times we don't take heed to the to what God is saying we don't take heed to the to the sort of stop signs to the road block sometime that God put before us and we go on in to that place and what happens God visits us sometimes with judgment but we know that you know like I said never kanessa his heart you know God lifts it up and the thing is God wanted to show him come on dad I'm not gonna share my glory with no hug come on I'm not gonna share my glory he said I'm the Lord and and I this is well this is all about him come on and it's not about you and what you can do but never kanessa had to realize that and even in you know when it came down to the end we know that the first thing he did when he came out of the curse that God put on him the Bible says that he began to he began to bless the Lord come on he began to say give glory and praise to the God Most High that's what he began to do when he came out of that come on but look look at your extreme measures that God had to do to get glory out of his life and I said even even with us as individuals sometimes what extreme measures that God has to go in our lives to get us to take the of focus and attention off of ourselves focus and attention offer your church offer this one or that one our offer your your status to do what - just get you back to a place the way you can start giving God glory again that kind of glory that he wants out of your life then I believe that but we're talking about all I would say the foolishness tonight God goes to extreme measures come on he goes to extreme measures to get glory I think about Moses and how he allowed Moses he waited years and years waited Moses to become 80 years old went to the extreme the way Moses was a man so weak you know in himself 80 years old well he even said I can't speak had no physical way of going down there and nothing physical about him that he would be able to look like to to bring about a change in that situation but God went to the extreme look like foolishness but that's what God what was it all about God wanted to do that and make it - that way so they came it was no kind of way that no man could glory out of it no man could get no glory in it only God Himself can get the glory out of it think about that and I think about how many examples in the scriptures I think about Gideon in the 300 come on oh I believe it was and he couldn't went witnessed with the 3000 he could've went with this but no God went to the extreme think about a little David facing Goliath God went to the extreme you say God what was it all for because God himself wanted to get the glory out of it and that's what it is we look at ourselves so much and say Lord oh not just to try to portray our humility but a lot of times God allows you know your failures to be exposed God allows you to see yourself as being insufficient God gets you to the place - sometimes you search and sometimes you're trying to figure it out but God don't seem like he opening the door don't seem like he revealing unto you but then when the time come God will put the words in your mouth God he keeps you sometimes like that to where you can stay humble and walk before him and you will know that the only way you can stand the way you standing it's only about the grace of God and we think about so many that's why I Paul I believe he can look at himself he can look at his insufficiencies he can look at the things that he's done in the background that he came from in the sin the sin or the chaos that he brought upon the Church of the Living God but then he can know that he can yield his cell to God in a way and only thing he only thing he could talk about was that Christ that was living in him that it was God that was doing the work he said if anybody you know I'm Richard I'm undone he said oh what a wretched man that I am now so you see I'm a prisoner for the Lord why because he learned how to yield himself to God he learned that the only the glory that was gonna come it was gonna be glory giving to God and I believe that tonight we look at even now Oh like I said the shape that the world is in I want to do it the UM read something that someone said it was just someone talking about the coronavirus and they were saying you know the virus outbreak it dictates when we can leave and the saga can continue isn't that extraordinary something is so small that we can't even see it but yet is keeping billions of people on lockdown it has closed borders it has families separated it has cost me for their jobs it has shut down businesses it keeps children out of schools and it dominates all of our conversation something seeming to be so small come on but what what God does you know sometimes we look and look at the world and look at great countries and look at a great doctors look at great a science and technology and and where we go into the moon and all these things but less the man says he says something this is extraordinary something this small did what it's got the whole world in in prison right now something this small is dictating to us where we can go got everybody billions on lockdown it costs you your job it's separated you from your families got the whole world shook something that small he said that's extraordinary but I think about it so when we look at you know a lot of times or we resting in impulse securities we resting on things that God can take something so small and shake it from underneath you just like that God they take something so small and turn the whole world you know sometimes upside down and we say we get back to the place the way all of our faults securities everything we thought that was secure come on we get back to that place the way we save God with the whole world fall apart your word is the only thing that's still solid your word is the only thing that is still keep us guard from falling apart and I believe that I was in prayer the other day just meditating on the Lord and thinking about these things and I said Lord you know even in your word it says heaven and earth will pass away but your word oh god it won't pass away I believe your word as Dave said it's forever settled in heaven you know it's no sure foundation that we have tonight outside of the Word of God outside of Christ himself there's no share foundation there's nothing solid that we can rest on but the Word of God tonight and I believe that but we find that here like we says they're talking about we're talking about foolishness I like how you know you know in the scriptures it says the foolishness of God is wiser than men in the weakness of God is stronger than men you know here in the here in the 17th verse you know he quoted a little but he was saying for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with the wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made none effect to you come on preach it Paul said I come to preaching not just in the wisdom the word cuz if I do that I'm taking I'm making a cross I'm not effect to you I'm taken away as he broke down later in the scriptures I'm taking away your Redemption I'm taking away your salvation I'm taking away your healing so I can't preach it to you in a way that it won't have a physical and a spiritual effect on your life but I gotta preach it in a way to where you can benefit from it if you ain't benefitting from it from the way that I'm preaching the gospel then it's killing you it ain't of no effect to you come on well he's saying in a short way to God you know we want to preach the gospel that that's real Lord we want to be able to to preach it in a way to way people can still be healed the way God I can bring you real again then God let me get down on my knees a little bit longer let me cry out until something happened God in the way when we preached it God helped me to learn how to get out of the way Paul said I got to preach it that way come on other than that I'll be just a Pharisee or sad you see he said so I ain't come to baptize you alone but I come to show you the power of God I saw I come to show you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter what the world is saying about him God is still real come on and that's how you know he was breaking it down and that's why I'm saying I said the thing is he said lest the cross should be made of none effect he goes on in 18 verse he says for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish is foolishness come on he says but to us which are saved is the power of God come on we're preaching to you it seemed like what they call foolishness come on because to them they can't grasp when they see the cross or they when they vision across it can't do nothing fun but you and I that believe we're drawing power from it we don't just look at the cross and just quote what we know about it but we see it we take it personal we say God you hung there for me God you bled and died for me Lord it's personal hallelujah when it becomes personal you can draw from it I think they said it said that when the when the blood or was shed on Calvary that released God come on the life that was in that blood come on when he came out you know he was able to come back on you and I in the form of the Holy Ghost and it did what it gave us such a measure of God that we can draw power from it you know they think talking about the ocean you might not have a spoon but a spoonful of the ocean but the same chemistry that's in that spoonful that you got is in the ocean itself it's the same chemistry it's the same makeup even though it's only a spoonful is still the ocean and we look at it even within ourselves now we know Christ was the fullness of it but he gave you and I uh-uh or himself and we we can't even live it in a fullness but we've got the message so what he gave come on but nevertheless it's God himself it's not just something we make it up but this is the chemistry you got it the life that sent you is God himself come on it's the michaelis it's God himself and if God is in you then all things are possible all you've got to do is believe come on but we find that he says for he says with the preaching of the Cross to them that perish you know it's foolishness but to us which are saved he said it's the power of God you know I began meditating on that I said what it is it's our hope it's our salvation come on it's our healing if Christ hadn't came and doing what he did you know all of us we wouldn't had no way of escape we wouldn't have had nobody to to stand before us on that day but now you know about the grace of God and in which we stand we got the ability to be able to stand even though our sins are scarlet we know that the blood of Jesus has made him white as snow we can stand boldly now before the throne of grace and ask for help mercy and grace in the time of need because why because all what he's done that's a told that don't believe it's foolishness this ain't something that you can make up in your mind or just dream about but it's got to become so real I believe to you that it does something for you it brings the power of God down in your life and that's what you know we're talking about even here tonight I says that's what the the shedding of his blood did it it released God from where the blood of Bullock's bulls and goats could only you know just I'll give you a torment of just in year-to-year but the life that was in that blood can come back on the believer so every year you had to come back and make the same sacrifice but when Christ died it was once and for all what he done come on and that and we could we can't never I say we can never take away take away from it but why why week like we said we call it foolishness why a lot of times you try to you try to get people to understand come on that is not in your ability you know it takes away from the words out of your mouth I or what I can do or what we can do or what I have done it takes that word out of your mouth because it brings to you an understanding a revelation that you couldn't do nothing it was all what he done it was all what he's still doing in your life and what does that do that that takes that out of your life and I says what happens a lot of times when the people can't see it and that's why you know you may we miss God and so many ways we miss God because we're looking for him in the wrong places we're looking for him in the wrong kind of character leadership we're looking for the wrong things but we got to get back to the simplicity which is in Christ I find you know I was I was thinking about saying one thing I love I says you know one thing I love here in the scriptures how Paul and the 28th verse he began to save you know that it was looking at 27 verse he says but God have chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God is chosen how God the Bible he says here that the things that are despised come on the weak things the things that are despised that's what God is chosen that's what God operates in but yet sometimes we missed it we can't see it because of where God I said where are we gonna find God that if you were where would you find out that it took me back in my mind you know testimony of me and uh brother Karl and how we were down in Orangeburg and how you know was out witness sinning we end up pulling up by our crack house and it was a riot in the back doing they what they were doing and it was a man you know he come from walking behind the house and he broke down in tears and and he began crying and he said y'all look at me he had a full suit on at the crack house Sunday afternoon when he had a full suit on at the crack house he said I got dressed to go to church this morning but I ain't never make it he said the drugs and any demons or the drugs had him had such a pool on him that he couldn't break free from it he got dressed he won't it delivers he won't God to do something for his life but the chains that he was in I believe come on some people sometimes they can't make it the boss house that's why God got to go to them that's why God had to go to certain places they're the people that wasn't welcome in a synagogue God had to go there come on it seems like foolishness what would you do fellowshiping with the people like that but God he chose the thing that the world rejected that the people didn't want to be around God chose to be around those people and he went there come on and I believe what we were talking to the man it did something so for us you know we begin to have prayer with the man right outside the crack house just praying with the man you know asking God to do something it brings about something your heart the the make you understand that you need a real gospel you need a gospel that's got power in it come on that'll break the people from the condition their lives area people won't help but they can't find help if you ain't piecing the gospel right they can't find help come on if you made it up not affect home you took the power away from it how do people gonna find help I said well guard people still need help today people still want to be delivered alcoholics still want to be delivered drug addict the prostitute still they want to be delivered can God be brought to the people I believe he can come on but it would be foolishness come on tell a man that God want to deliver you come on you don't try and rehab I think about my dad you don't try it at this you don't try to chew me come on now God want to do something with your life come on you don't try now like she says the preaching of the gospel that's how God chose the saying to the world is foolishness come on today's lecture - foolishness but you preached it in the right way and still power in it that's the way that God chose come on to deliver people and I believe that I always believe that's why I say God it's more about just talking but I believe that it's it's walking in his presence it's getting to a place you know even it even of the Pharisees and the scribes you know when Jesus was speaking you know a lot of what he was doing he was rehearsing the scriptures he was quoting and they said yeah we you know this man ain't saying nothing new but he says it's just a way nobody we never heard it the way he's saying it come on he was saying it the same thing but we never heard it like that come on how did they hear because it was Authority in it he was speaking like they say as one with authority and one with power come on you can preach the gospel but how how is it being heard come on you can witness my how's it being heard come on you can say the same thing that has been said before but how's it being heard I said God when they hear it doesn't have power in it doesn't have life in it is there something in it that's going wrong drone of God and that's what we want getting us back to the place why because we realize sometimes you realize physically within yourself you can't help come on the world can't help people need Christ people need a real experience with God they need God to do something real in their life they need the same Jesus that walked the shores of Galilee they need that same Jesus that stood at Lazarus grave they need that same Jesus come on then being in the tomb but he rose from the dead and he said it all power come on is given unto me we need that same Jesus they gave you a commission the go ye unto the world he says and preach the gospel he says he says these signs that shall follow them that believe they need the same Jesus they need the same you if you believe it the same way I believe that same Jesus come down on the scene today and that's what we need come on that same Jesus well we find that like it says too many it's foolishness but you look at you you look at a lot of things and I says you know one thing I says what is despised the things that's despised in the base world in the base of this world he said God have chosen and the things that are not you know he took things that are and that no flesh should glory in his presence God chose the weakest things you know God chose you because he knew you were weak God chose you because he knew that you weren't capable of doing the job but he done that he said that no flesh should glory in his presence and I thank God sometimes we measure ourselves by ourselves the Bible say that ain't wise come on but we should mark the perfect man which is Christ Jesus we're looking for God to do great things and do greater things in our lives we look out says what it is you know I thank God I thank God that he don't mind come on going to the street corner I thank God that he don't mind going to the places where nobody else won't go and I said that if that same if that God is in you would you go to the places nobody else wouldn't go would you go to the street corner would you go was you fellowship with those or sit down and talk it over with those that nobody else wouldn't come on because if that same Christ is in you then then that's what he would be doing so are you willing to go that extra mile come on it seems that way but a lot of times we're gonna be surprised I believe who made it and who didn't why because God looking down in the heart of man come on we're talking about the foolishness I said you know what we look at you know even God shows God shows even out of all the technology planning settles back up you know and all these things and the way the world has progressed we still in desperate need of His grace we still in everyday we still in desperate need of the mercy of God and more and more I believe that the mercy of God god bless you know the Lord amen God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise it was foolishness to save them that was lost the cross amen I believe it's the same gospel amen and I believe that blood has not lost its power as of yet and I believe if we preach they meant the same gospel to get the same results they meant praise God the Bible gave us something to save them that a loss amen he said preach the gospel preaching in season out of season he meant preach it if the hidden preacher that they don't yeah he meant the same word he meant God word has never lost its power he said heaven and earth will pass away but God word it's going to stand he meant with all this field God would never fail he meant somebody said well God didn't do what I thought the work should have done Amen I said the aim of God is faithful amen it's impossible for God to tell a lie Amen if God didn't do what you thought he should have done Amen I want you to know that God had a plan a mitten in the mind of God Amen he said your ways are not my ways and your thoughts are not my thoughts he meant God knew what he was doing Amen praise God sometimes he meant we find out he meant when the morning come in behind bar we understand it better by and by when the morning come sometimes because he meant we think God has failed us they meant God never fail Amen praise God God never make mistakes Amen because he is God hallelujah so it doesn't matter how folks he meant had looked at God and as though God did not do what he promised but he meant and God word was not effective and God word couldn't pay men our dreams and our hopes come to pass but I want you to know that God knows hallelujah praise God you ask for God to do what you want him to do and God does say men what he ordained before the foundation of the world and what he promised to do hallelujah sometimes God answers our prayers and somebody said God works in mysterious ways and wanders to perform God does sings in man don't then that God is doing it praise God God sometimes is doing it even while we're sleeping and God doing it and our failure God is still working he meant when it looked like he meant off he meant everything is the law says that the words that our minister Leggett was talking about earnest was talking about amen and look like a met God had failed Martha and Mary but God had a plan he meant one day met in the resurrection morning with death prison bars are broken he many will look Amen praise God and see that God had a hand they met sometimes God has a plan and God knows when I worked out his dive hallelujah well I've gone the last mile of the way they meant praise God when God said it's finished it's finished we thank God for the word today I was in Pride today and and I was going through save yourself amen Peter on the day of Pentecost he was telling the people save yourself when this untoward generation if it ever was an untoward generation I believe we're in that under ward generation and he said save yourself amen what what are you saying when Peter a mint was preaching that sermon on in the second chapter of Acts he said to him give all the prophets witness and extend that through his name whosoever believe on him shall receive remission of sin I want you to know in acts two he said they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that AFOL even as many as the Lord our God shall call and many of the words it is testifying exalt saying see yourself save yourself from this untoward generation amen I want to know I want you to know those that saved themselves he made the same day they were added to them about 3,000 Souls how was it he meant they saved themselves even mama can't see you daddy can't save you grandma can't save you you got to save yourself he met praise God for this untoward generation you got to do it they met you got to be pricked in your heart as they said what must I do serve what must I do to be seen I want to know what I got to do you got to repair save yourself repair or perish amen it looked like no looked like a fool he made it look like he was crazy look like a modern man but God took the foolishness they meant no preaching to condemn the world one man with one massive condemn a whole world they meant praise God I believe as it was in the days of law and as the walls in the deeds of love that should it be oh yes I believe thou shalt being the day when the Son of Man is revealed I believe the same dots for the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if they rejected nor they reject the word today because these are the days they rejected him and praise God they just a with them to Sodom and tell him to come on out they may give Sodom space and he couldn't find 10 praise God I wonder if God could find 10 in America we can find 10 never repent they come out of Sodom come on conditioned women cutout of the world come back to God that he's five-ten and he said I'll spider city but it couldn't find pain in Sodom and Gomorrah God couldn't find ten already found in the deeds of know will hate souls brothers so there's somebody I want to be ready when Jesus call when they come I want to be ready what are you doing to prepare yourself save yourself praise God when the word is interpreted by your life praise God when the guard is demonstrating through you what's written in the Bible it's no longer in the pages his own two feet Jesus Christ walking in you amen Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory amen you are a man of demonstrating Jesus Christ that he's still alive they meant that he lives not a dad Jesus I mean Jesus had risen from the dead some folks said he he didn't do it they did but somehow they must justify me that something about you that's peculiar amen certain about you that 100 the world it's going crazy man and not all kind of sinful and filthy and ungodly stuff that's somebody that's a oh yes the same Jesus that the appearance the Bible said every eye shall see him even him that pierced him they got to see him one name I want you to know it you might not take your soul serious your walk with Christ it might be a little you know just taking a light your soul don't mean too much to you today your soul is not important now you don't value your eternal destiny amen you don't value you just looking at the knob your not knowing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is as one day that is an eternity they meant that way no they meant you can be eternally separated from God or you can be with God in eternity but friends God I want you to know he meant God calling somebody calling somebody a meant that he foreknew that he saw in his mind before the foundation of the world and God called you got to have some in that because the deep call to the deep and God knows where your [Music] save yourself save yourself to answer the call of God the world is falling apart get back what you're gonna do about your soul when you go back to the room will you go again servants of God it seals in the forehead I want you to know God can hold things back because he got somebody that need to come to God he got somebody [Music] well he

struggles but look at the one that says look at him and live look at Jesus Christ but there is where your victory is I'm looking at a new world I'm looking at a new heaven and a new earth my hope was not in this world neither the things that are in the world but I'm looking to their unseen I'm looking by faith and I got hope that God made a promise then he's coming back again and here I can hold a mint hold on to what God said amen no matter how many stones reach it doesn't matter what goes on I'm a whole to God's unchanging hand hold on sex you might look foolish right now he meant because you're not going to the same extreme as others even you're trusting in a God that folks say you can't see what you're trusting anyhow he meant you he meant trusting in when eyes have not seen men the thing that God has prepared for them that love about do you love him tonight and if you love him wait over if you love and trust him your lovin said God amen don't you see me yeah I love your Lord thank you Jesus I love him tonight trust the Lord foolishness of preaching to save them that allows the foolishness of the cross to save them that perish if you don't believe the cross amen then you become not you become a fool in a sense of God's gonna have the last laugh we are looked at as the art scorn of the earth and the world call us fools to believe in a God that your eyes can't see but they don't understand Moses forsook Egypt being a pharaoh because he saw him who is invisible Moses saw the invisible God how did Moses see an invisible God what did Moses have to see an invisible God the Bible said by faith he saw him faith is the eyes that Moses could look into the unseen and see him who is invisible that same faith that Moses had to see him who was invisible by faith we see him who's invisible god bless tonight god bless Minister Lee getting god bless brother Lee's denied share with us the foolishness of the cross amen the foolishness of this gospel the foolishness of Noah preaching every servant of God was called food was rejected because the things that they said made him look like it was foolishness because they were saying things that didn't make any sense a virgin
