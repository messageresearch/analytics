[37:06] he turn me to the book of uh
[37:08] first corinthians
[37:11] the 14th chapter
[37:14] and uh we're going to read first
[37:16] corinthians 14 and 10.
[37:20] amen praise god
[37:26] if you got us reads there are it may be
[37:31] so many kinds of voices in the world
[37:34] and none of them is without
[37:36] signification
[37:38] let us pray
[37:39] heavenly father we just read a piece of
[37:42] thy word lord a scripture a verse oh god
[37:45] we take pray tonight and thought you
[37:46] just take it lord and just do with it as
[37:48] you see foot we thank you lord in jesus
[37:51] christ and thank for these people lord
[37:52] thank you lord for this fellowship we
[37:54] just pray you get the glory in jesus
[37:56] christ's name amen it made me be seated
[38:00] it may want to take a little thought
[38:01] from that
[38:02] hearing the voice of god
[38:06] and come back to the voice
[38:10] hearing the voice of god
[38:12] come back to the voice
[38:15] here are paul hill's ministering here to
[38:17] the corinthians letting him know that
[38:20] there are many voices inside the world
[38:22] and all these voices that you might hear
[38:24] all are mean something
[38:26] he's anonymous without signification i
[38:28] mean behind the voice is an intent and a
[38:31] meeting
[38:32] trying to express something to get you
[38:34] to either do something or say something
[38:36] to you to cause you to react to
[38:37] something so it's a voice
[38:40] amen praise god so we now talk about
[38:42] hearing the voice of god so only one
[38:45] voice you really need to hear and that's
[38:47] god's voice
[38:49] you need to hear the voice of god in
[38:52] order to hear god's voice you have to be
[38:54] able to recognize his voice
[38:56] and now a lot of people feel that they
[38:58] can't recognize the voice of god
[39:00] and we can finally show you that through
[39:02] the scriptures god has always spoken
[39:05] through his voice
[39:07] only few people have seen a
[39:10] form of god or or seen something
[39:13] that you can see it was god but nobody
[39:15] had really seen god
[39:17] moses didn't really see god moses saw
[39:19] the back parts of god but nobody really
[39:22] seen god everybody that god has dealt
[39:24] with they have only heard one thing his
[39:26] voice
[39:28] they heard the voice of god see whenever
[39:31] god is trying to get across to us we
[39:33] need to hear god's voice
[39:36] we're going to be able to discern and
[39:38] recognize where the voice of god is at
[39:42] see you've got to be to recognize the
[39:43] voice of god dessert is that the voice
[39:45] of god i'm here and we as christians we
[39:47] should be able to discern the voice of
[39:49] god
[39:51] jesus if my sheep will do what hear my
[39:54] voice
[39:56] that was him walking around in the
[39:57] physical realm he was on earth saying
[39:59] that but where is he at now
[40:01] his voice is still here on the earth
[40:04] god's voice is still here
[40:06] so we need to be able to recognize the
[40:08] voice of god and there are many voices
[40:11] in the world
[40:13] all these voices want to be heard
[40:15] oh hallelujah
[40:17] you got the political voice that voice
[40:19] is out there strong in the world are
[40:21] they trying to persuade people over this
[40:22] way trying to persuade you over that way
[40:25] it's a political voice it's a voice and
[40:27] it got a meeting behind it
[40:29] it's trying to accomplish something
[40:32] you're trying to bring something to pass
[40:33] it man but that's not the voice god
[40:35] wants you to hear
[40:37] god don't want you to pay no attention
[40:38] to this political voice your political
[40:40] father you can do nothing for you but
[40:41] take you down away from god
[40:44] don't pay no attention as a political
[40:46] voice it's not in it for a christian
[40:50] amen they ain't the voice that god wants
[40:51] you to hear god wants you to hear his
[40:53] voice
[40:55] hear the voice of god
[40:57] it may not only hear the voice of god
[40:59] but once you have heard the voice of god
[41:01] don't turn away from the voice of god it
[41:03] means come back to the voice it was
[41:06] crying out in me by the grace of god
[41:08] come back to the voice of god
[41:11] see we listen to too many voices
[41:14] and these voices are trying to take you
[41:16] astray
[41:17] you got the church voice people listen
[41:19] to the church boy what my church say
[41:21] that ain't the voice god i want you to
[41:23] listen to god i want you to hear his
[41:25] voice god voices the church voices two
[41:28] different voices
[41:30] amen go to the church always ain't
[41:32] saying what god is saying so god i want
[41:34] you to hear what his voice is saying
[41:36] and any man's voice is his word
[41:40] hallelujah god's voice is his word
[41:42] so when god speaks you got to be able to
[41:44] discern a man the voice of god a lot of
[41:48] people can't discern the voice of god
[41:49] because when they said a voice their
[41:51] faith that's a man
[41:54] ain't none of the man who i ain't paying
[41:56] attention to him you're a man nor the
[41:59] man that's the voice of god in a man
[42:02] god voice is out of mind that what god
[42:04] always is done he never changes his

[43:52] those are false voices trying to get you
[43:55] out of the will of god
[43:57] trying to get you away from the word of
[43:58] god but god's voice when it speaks it
[44:01] only encourages you to get closer to god
[44:04] encourage you a man to get oh my god
[44:08] to do the things of god that's god
[44:09] that's how you know it's god's voice you
[44:11] don't speak according to god's word
[44:13] ain't god voice amen so we want to hear
[44:16] and be able to discern the voice of god
[44:18] amen we hear voices now god void
[44:21] everybody got to discern god's voice now
[44:24] for god to put his voice on please and
[44:26] if you don't recognize it that was god
[44:28] speaking to you you didn't even know it
[44:30] was god
[44:31] god voiced inside your parents
[44:34] i said god voices are your parents
[44:37] god put his voice inside our parents to
[44:39] lead us and guide us and they ain't even
[44:41] got to be christian parents god's voices
[44:43] don't speak to them to tell you the
[44:45] right thing
[44:46] see but you got to be discerned that
[44:48] voice whether it's the voice of god
[44:50] speaking
[44:51] hallelujah ever trying to keep you in
[44:53] the right way and to keep you in the
[44:54] right path that's the voice of god
[44:57] see don't miss god's voice
[45:00] don't look at the veil
[45:02] look and listen to the voice
[45:04] listen to the words that's being spoken
[45:06] either god's word is the devil's word i
[45:08] believe it's god's word
[45:10] i believe god is speaking
[45:12] hallelujah trying to get people to come
[45:14] back to the voice
[45:15] so god has always dealt through a voice
[45:19] that we said very few people have seen
[45:22] god
[45:23] paul saw a light
[45:25] within that light he heard a voice
[45:28] the boy spoke to him saying saul saul
[45:30] why persecutors about me
[45:33] it was hard for me to kick against the
[45:35] pricks he heard the voice and he
[45:37] recognized that was god
[45:40] he hadn't had the voice of the church
[45:41] for so long but god had to come and
[45:43] interrupt that voice amen to show him
[45:46] that the voice he was listening to was
[45:48] not the voice of god oh hallelujah
[45:51] it looked like it was the voice of god
[45:52] but it wasn't it was the church voice
[45:56] leading him to do something contrary to
[45:58] the will of god but god came
[46:00] he saw the light but most importantly he
[46:03] heard the voice
[46:06] he heard the voice of god and he reacted
[46:08] to it
[46:09] he reacted to the voice and it changed
[46:11] his life because he recognized that it
[46:14] wasn't man speaking it was god speaking
[46:16] see then when he got to recognize he
[46:18] discerned the voice now
[46:20] because god is always speaking
[46:23] he's always speaking see the bible say
[46:26] wisdom
[46:27] out
[46:28] her voice cries out on the streets of
[46:30] the city only when a wizard can discern
[46:33] the voice of god
[46:35] see you got to be discerning the voice
[46:37] now god voice god has always dealt with
[46:41] uh with man through his voice
[46:44] you're not gonna see something that you
[46:46] can physically put your eye on
[46:49] he showed moses a burning bush
[46:51] but moses still heard what the boys
[46:55] the voice called on him moses mother you
[46:57] heard the voice he had to be with the
[46:58] voice they do not what the bush said
[47:01] the divorce was the important thing not
[47:03] the bush
[47:05] see the bush was only to attract his
[47:07] attention that he can hear what the
[47:08] voice was saying see the voice is the
[47:11] important thing that where god i wanted
[47:13] to hear his voice hear the voice of god
[47:16] hallelujah let's go to the book of
[47:17] genesis amen
[47:19] hallelujah adam and eve in the garden of
[47:21] eden you know they never saw the god
[47:23] that created them
[47:26] it's no more where in scripture that
[47:28] they say they saw anything physical or
[47:30] anything like that one thing the bible
[47:31] let us know that they heard god's voice
[47:36] they heard his voice see that's how they
[47:37] know it was god after they had done
[47:39] wrong the bible said they heard the
[47:41] voice of the lord god walking in the
[47:43] garden in the cool of the day they heard
[47:45] his voice
[47:47] see that's all they knew was the voice
[47:49] of god
[47:51] that was able to fellowship with god
[47:52] because god spoke to them
[47:55] he spoke to them seeing they recognized
[47:57] when they had done wrong they heard his
[47:59] voice walking in the garden
[48:02] calling under adam see that's how god
[48:04] deals he deals with his voice now that's
[48:06] very important
[48:07] when you read the scripture you'll find
[48:09] out that all through the scripture god's
[48:11] only talking about one thing his voice
[48:15] he dealt he dealt with israel the same
[48:17] way i commanded thee not no sacrifice i
[48:19] command you on the offering there's only
[48:21] one thing i commanded you that is to
[48:23] obey my voice
[48:25] that's all god's concerned about you
[48:27] don't care about sacrifice so much you
[48:29] don't care about offering so much what
[48:31] he wants you to do is obey his voice
[48:34] see but first you got to discern the
[48:36] voice of god
[48:37] the voice of god i'm hearing i declare
[48:39] to you tonight this is the voice of god
[48:42] this is the voice of god speaking and
[48:44] speaking through your pastor
[48:46] god voices in your pastor now if you
[48:48] don't believe that he wouldn't do
[48:49] nothing he tell you to do you can piece
[48:51] to his face turn blue using he i ain't
[48:53] paying attention to him
[48:55] god ain't speaking through them the
[48:56] voice of guardians of them but if you
[48:58] believe that the voice of god is in your
[49:00] pastor then you'll do whatever he
[49:02] preaching for you to do
[49:04] because you know you don't believe us
[49:05] the man it's the voice of god
[49:08] come on somebody
[49:10] if it's the voice of god and you won't
[49:11] pay no attention but you believe with
[49:13] the voice of god then it'll take effect
[49:16] it'll do something for you but long you
[49:18] don't believe us the voice of god then

[49:51] grace of god oh god i read that i talked

[50:51] you mean the children so wrapped up in
[50:53] the phone or the computer that god can't

[53:28] in these last days
[53:30] he laughs at all these voices trying to
[53:32] get our attention everything trying to
[53:34] get our attention trying to drown out
[53:36] the voice i'm not going to let him drop
[53:37] it out the whole no sir i need to have
[53:39] god's voice nobody got to listen to a
[53:41] team they won't have to listen to the
[53:43] bible they've got to read the bible
[53:45] inside that is to what the voice of god
[53:48] come on somebody you got to hear god's
[53:51] voice
[53:52] don't go on this world without listening
[53:54] to the voice of god
[53:56] you got to hear god's fault we all got
[53:58] to hear god i want to hear god's voice
[53:59] amen praise god notice here so not
[54:02] listening to the voice of god it gets
[54:04] you in all kind of trouble
[54:06] because people will lead you astray they
[54:08] got good intentions now don't get it
[54:10] wrong they got good intentions they
[54:12] don't mean no harm but remember it ain't
[54:14] got voice talking
[54:16] that's them talking
[54:18] their intention might be good and
[54:20] everything like that but it might lead
[54:22] you ascray
[54:24] it might lead you out of the will of god
[54:27] see that way you want to hear god's
[54:29] voice
[54:30] very important we hear voices of god
[54:32] look at uh an example here by the grace
[54:35] go to the book of samuel you all know
[54:37] the scripture here let's go to samuel uh
[54:39] 15.
[54:41] notice here how god uh sent saul on on
[54:45] on
[54:46] a journey to go and do something for him
[54:49] he sent his word to the prophet samuel
[54:52] samuel just a voice he's just a
[54:53] mouthpiece that god used to speak his
[54:55] word that's right he was only that's all
[54:57] he was saying thing is today god used
[55:00] men as mouthpiece to speak his word so
[55:02] then we have to discern did you not
[55:04] listen to man's word you might hear
[55:05] man's voice but really there's god's
[55:07] voice speaking with man's voice
[55:11] i said it's god's voice
[55:13] speaking with man's voice amen there are
[55:15] people get so twisted up sometimes they
[55:17] hate man's bar but really it's god's
[55:19] voice using man's voice
[55:22] amen the speaker's word
[55:24] that why is good not to have no
[55:27] ism or schism against nobody
[55:30] because if you're not careful you can
[55:32] shut down the voice
[55:34] none of y'all heard that or not
[55:37] that was good not to have no ism or
[55:39] schism against nobody
[55:41] because if so doing so you can shut down
[55:44] the voice
[55:45] see because you say oh i don't like him
[55:48] i don't like this one uh i don't
[55:51] see them what you're doing you're
[55:52] shutting down the voice of god
[55:54] see you don't know what god gonna say
[55:56] you know what god gonna do don't shut
[55:58] down the voice
[56:00] don't don't have nothing against nobody
[56:03] don't let nobody lead you or scrape by
[56:05] talking about somebody saying something
[56:07] about somebody don't let them leave you
[56:08] a script because a lot of time all that
[56:10] do is take you away from hearing the
[56:12] voice of god
[56:13] god can use anybody now he'll speak
[56:18] you've got to be able to discern and
[56:19] listen
[56:20] see you could god to speak now amen
[56:23] praise god let's go through our samuel
[56:24] amen
[56:25] amen first samuel 15
[56:27] amen praise god
[56:45] y'all god sent him on the journey
[56:46] everything i did he started out doing
[56:48] real good he went and did something but
[56:50] he uh he got around some people oh man
[56:53] that really looks good
[56:56] oh that look good right there too let's
[56:57] keep that
[56:59] oh the king of the gang he don't look
[57:00] that bad let's keep him too
[57:04] people
[57:06] he was doing good he was following the
[57:07] voice of the lord but all of a sudden he
[57:09] got around some people that took them
[57:12] away from falling the voice of the lord
[57:14] did y'all hear that
[57:16] see
[57:17] people they don't mean no harm now i
[57:19] don't believe none of people made any
[57:20] harm
[57:22] but telling him to let's save this let's
[57:24] keep this let's get to him man god i've
[57:26] loved the sacrifice look how look that's
[57:28] a pretty one right there get that one
[57:29] there they gotta love that one yeah
[57:31] madam what god told him to do though
[57:33] that wasn't the voice of the lord

[57:36] law what did the voice of the lord tell
[57:38] them to do
[57:39] come on somebody kill everything
[57:44] everything don't leave nothing that was
[57:46] what the voice of who the lord kill
[57:49] everything
[57:50] don't bring nothing back but all the
[57:53] voice crepe inside there
[57:55] the people
[57:58] the voice of the people
[58:00] prevailed against the voice of god
[58:03] he let the voice of the people prevail
[58:05] over him
[58:06] against the voice of god
[58:08] lord have mercy don't let it fall into
[58:10] that trap of the devil amen
[58:12] don't let the devil let you
[58:14] it might have been might have been a
[58:15] relative a close relative yo you know we
[58:18] lose our relatives sometimes y'all come
[58:20] on somebody you know that close relative
[58:23] then
[58:25] they get you out of the will of god if
[58:26] there's somebody close
[58:28] amen they got him the the brick not to
[58:32] listen to the voice amen praise god
[58:34] first samuel

[58:41] spirit egg in the best of the sheep and
[58:43] of the oxen of the fatlings and the
[58:45] lambs and all that was good not only
[58:47] destroyed them but everything that was
[58:49] vile and refuge that they utterly
[58:52] destroyed then came the word of the lord
[58:54] and the samuel saying
[58:56] it repented me that i have set up saul
[58:57] to be king he had gone back from
[58:59] following me and did not perform my
[59:01] commandment and he grieved salmon he
[59:03] cried unto the lord all night so these
[59:06] people got him in bad shape all right
[59:09] and 13th verse and samuel said uh samuel
[59:11] came to psalms said saul said unto him
[59:13] be blessed to be thou the lord i have
[59:15] performed the commandments of the lord
[59:16] and samuel said what mean at the end of

[59:24] what these sheep doing here

[59:33] you know you didn't do the word of the
[59:34] lord amen and saul said
[59:36] they have brought them back from their
[59:39] malachi for the people spared of the

[1:12:27] voice of god
[1:12:28] we don't run after everything let's come
[1:12:31] back to god's voice let's come back to
[1:12:32] hearing the voice of god
[1:12:34] see we we we need a repentance lord i i
[1:12:37] i repent lord that i am and hearing your
[1:12:39] voice like i should
[1:12:41] everything else i'm blocking it out i
[1:12:42] can't even hear the voice of god today
[1:12:45] i think we need as a repentance need to
[1:12:46] be called
[1:12:48] amen the people could come back to
[1:12:49] listening to the voice of god
[1:12:52] we run around
[1:12:53] doing everything every and anything
[1:12:56] and we ain't got time to listen to the
[1:12:58] voice of god maybe god will tell you
[1:13:00] said you don't need to do that today
[1:13:03] you need to stay home and pray
[1:13:06] but you so caught up in what you're
[1:13:08] doing
[1:13:09] you can't hear god's voice
[1:13:12] see we so caught up
[1:13:14] amen i think it's time to be uncaught up
[1:13:18] and caught up with god's voice
[1:13:20] lord what will you have me to do
[1:13:22] lord where you want me to go
[1:13:24] lord let me hear your boy i want to hear
[1:13:26] god's voice amen
[1:13:28] praise god i want to hear the voice of
[1:13:29] god genesis 22
[1:13:31] amen praise god
[1:13:33] genesis 22
[1:13:34] and 16.
[1:13:38] now god when god speak
[1:13:40] a lot of times he may say something to
[1:13:42] you that you might even find written
[1:13:45] inside the scripture
[1:13:46] but that doesn't mean it's not god's
[1:13:47] voice
[1:13:50] doesn't mean it's not god's voice
[1:13:52] a lot of things that was said was not
[1:13:55] written yet but never left with god
[1:13:57] speaking and the people did what god
[1:13:58] said then it became scripture but it
[1:14:01] wasn't written that okay i would get the
[1:14:03] bible and see it was in the bible no
[1:14:05] you're gonna be able to do that all the
[1:14:07] time you gotta take this thing by faith
[1:14:11] you gotta take this thing by faith i
[1:14:13] believe this is the voice of god and you
[1:14:15] act on it because in my timeline you can
[1:14:17] find it written
[1:14:19] he's a brother again that sounds
[1:14:20] contrary no it's not conjured about it
[1:14:22] the way god always works
[1:14:24] god knows changes program
[1:14:25] the god come and speak to you then it it
[1:14:28] becomes scripture
[1:14:30] amen it it it it'll line up if it's
[1:14:33] god's speaking it'll line up with what's
[1:14:34] been written
[1:14:35] it'll line right up so i'm going to say
[1:14:37] if god's speaking to you
[1:14:39] you're all the time it might gonna be
[1:14:40] written verbatim in the bible like we
[1:14:43] want to see it in there but it was the
[1:14:44] voice of god it'll come to pass
[1:14:47] that's what jesus said if you know how
[1:14:49] you know it's god's speaking if the
[1:14:51] thing that is spoken don't come to pass
[1:14:53] then you know it's not god speaking
[1:14:54] that's right but becoming the past then
[1:14:57] that's me said the lord that's right
[1:14:59] that's how we know so god might tell you
[1:15:01] to do something i believe when he told
[1:15:04] the young rich ruler to go say all you
[1:15:06] got
[1:15:07] give to the poor then come take up your
[1:15:09] cross and follow me that wasn't written
[1:15:13] that was jesus telling him to do
[1:15:15] all he'd do was to build a voice
[1:15:18] he would have been a blessed young man

[1:27:14] if we can only hear what the spirit has
[1:27:16] to say to the church
[1:27:18] we appreciate it
[1:27:20] i was
[1:27:21] reading uh
[1:27:24] finney and um
[1:27:26] and i was just reading and it was
[1:27:29] you know talking about
[1:27:31] different ministers and
[1:27:33] they said that um
[1:27:36] somebody wanted revival finney deals
[1:27:38] with revival without revival the lord
[1:27:41] gave him a you know
[1:27:43] a revivalist
[1:27:45] ministry and
[1:27:47] he was one of the
[1:27:48] people that probably god talked about
[1:27:52] finney
[1:27:53] and um
[1:27:54] god used him mightily
[1:27:57] but anyway he was
[1:28:00] saying that
[1:28:01] the people want a revival in the city
[1:28:04] the church wanted a revival
[1:28:07] and the preacher prayed and prayed and
[1:28:10] prayed for revival
[1:28:12] preacher wanted a revival so he failed
[1:28:15] to seek god praying for revival
[1:28:19] you want a revival so bad
[1:28:21] seeking god praying
[1:28:23] fasting doing everything
[1:28:25] trying to bring revival the people
[1:28:27] wanted revival
[1:28:30] he was so desperate for revival
[1:28:33] until he died trying to bring revival to
[1:28:35] the people
[1:28:38] so the next preacher came
[1:28:41] the people still wanted to revive a
[1:28:42] revival
[1:28:44] he went there praying and praying
[1:28:47] seeking for revival
[1:28:49] it was so hard
[1:28:51] you know to get the people and revive a
[1:28:53] movie so they had a little spurt every
[1:28:55] night and then but the people got back
[1:28:58] you know just like the world
[1:29:00] but he wanted revival revival so that
[1:29:02] preacher
[1:29:04] he
[1:29:06] jesus got so woe out and not done he
[1:29:09] left
[1:29:11] he just left
[1:29:12] he was just
[1:29:14] he had done
[1:29:15] he just wore himself out you know
[1:29:18] did everything he could do
[1:29:21] and it just
[1:29:22] it was so much on him
[1:29:24] if he wouldn't have left it would have
[1:29:26] killed him too
[1:29:28] so um
[1:29:30] so they came to
[1:29:32] one of the trusted men in the church
[1:29:36] came to afini and asked him to come
[1:29:39] to the church because they wanted
[1:29:41] revival
[1:29:44] and finnish say you don't kill one
[1:29:49] you don't want another one
[1:29:51] and you want me to come
[1:29:54] to give a revival
[1:29:58] he said you go you go back
[1:30:00] and you tell that church
[1:30:04] if they want revival
[1:30:06] they need to repent and they need to get
[1:30:08] out and they need to what happened was
[1:30:12] they wanted the preacher to give them
[1:30:13] revival but they weren't doing nothing
[1:30:17] and so uh finney told them y'all want
[1:30:20] revival y'all y'all wasn't helping the
[1:30:23] preacher
[1:30:25] but y'all wanted revival but y'all
[1:30:27] wasn't doing what it takes to have a
[1:30:29] revival but y'all want the preacher to
[1:30:31] do it all
[1:30:32] and the preacher killed itself but y'all
[1:30:34] wasn't supporting him
[1:30:37] so what happened
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:40] he said you go back and you tell that
[1:30:42] those people to repent
[1:30:44] and tell them to clean up their lives
[1:30:46] and all
[1:30:47] and then he began to cry out for revival
[1:30:50] themselves
[1:30:52] and then you come back
[1:30:54] and god will send them a preacher
[1:30:57] and a pastor for them
[1:30:59] but they got to do it
[1:31:02] you see what
[1:31:03] and i you know and he was telling some
[1:31:05] other stories
[1:31:06] about he said i've seen uh
[1:31:09] a thousand different situations
[1:31:12] he was telling how
[1:31:13] preachers got wore out and how do people
[1:31:16] kill the preacher
[1:31:18] and i said oh lord
[1:31:25] he said
[1:31:26] people can kill the preacher
[1:31:29] and the people can't help the preacher
[1:31:31] he's the one
[1:31:33] he said
[1:31:36] he said one of the things that that
[1:31:38] uh
[1:31:39] uh
[1:31:40] kills the uh preacher
[1:31:42] is that the people don't want the
[1:31:44] preacher to be personal
[1:31:48] he said but if the preacher don't be
[1:31:49] personal and don't preach on personal
[1:31:52] your personal life he said if he don't
[1:31:55] then god ain't using it
[1:31:57] he said but that's what oh he picking on
[1:32:00] me pic he said if he don't pick on you
[1:32:04] then god ain't using him
[1:32:06] he must pick on you
[1:32:08] it must be personal
[1:32:11] he said that's how you know god is using
