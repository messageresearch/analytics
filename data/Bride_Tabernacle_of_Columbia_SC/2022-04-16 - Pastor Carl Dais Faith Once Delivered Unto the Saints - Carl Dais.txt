brother jeremiah brother earnest lord touch lord in a special and a mighty way have your way tonight for we love you now pull on the word tonight i'm under expectation tonight i need something from god tonight thank you tonight bless your people bless your word in jesus name we pray amen as we stand tonight the book of jude the book of jude amen jude one if you have it say man jude one and three he says beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation see it's common just common salvation if it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained unto this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into luciferousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt after what destroyed them that believed not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved in everlasting chains into darkness until the judgment of the great day even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example of suffering and vengeance of eternal fire may the lord had a blessing to the reason of swords you may be seated i've thought tonight faith once delivered unto the saints faith once delivered unto the saints now we know faith is direct faith is a direct revelation it's a complete confidence and trust in god it settles you it establishes you so the faith that was once delivered unto the saints jude saying i earnestly i want you to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints so what faith is he talking about what faith is he talking about once delivered unto the saints the faith of the children of the gospel of this bible the apostles and the prophets he's he as as as malachi said turn your hearts back to the faith that was once delivered unto the saints so this faith that we're talking about tonight we have to come back to it where the supernatural is taking place in our midst i want to read something here before i get too excited pastor simmons gave me this book years ago amen love forgives what produces faith forgiveness forgive continually and it forgives comprehensively forgiveness wipe clean the slate of offense hence it is freeing for everyone forgiveness was the heartbeat of jesus some of his last words requested forgiveness from god for the ignorant acts of his offenders christ's greatest act of love was forgiveness he extended by his voluntary death at the cross colossians 2 13-15 forgiveness is the fuel for living a life free of clutter and cutting words of unjust acts see forgiveness is a fuel for living a life free of clutter of cutting words or unjust acts see when you begin to forgive tonight you don't have to worry about words that come out that shouldn't come out you don't have to worry about seeing things that you shouldn't say when you got a heart of forgiveness because forgiveness a checkmate it will begin to check your attitude and your behavior because let me don't get too excited a life without forgiveness is a lonely life locked up in his solitary confinement of sin forgiveness flows when you have been authenticated authentically and thoroughly forgiven half-hearted forgiveness is the destiny of those who have not tasted the tender touch of forgiveness from their heavenly father from from their heavenly father useless unless the forgiveness of god have graced your heart and soul your capacity forgiveness will be foreign and futile it is the grace of god and faith in him that fuels forgiveness to christ's followers the job description of christians is to love with forgiveness because we have been forgiven colossians 3 and 13. think about the depths and the breath of forgiveness ignorant acts they are forgiven drunkenness is forgiveness lust is forgiven immorality is forgiven hate is forgiven ignoring god is forgiven unbelief is forgiven love forgives because it has been forgiven see love forgives because it have been forgiven but we talking about faith tonight once delivered but as i started this sermon on last night god began to show me this morning to have faith they have to forgive you have to forgive to have faith and when you forgive it now anchors the love because first you recognize that you have been forgiven for your sins and once you recognize what love have been forgiven for what you have committed then you can look to your brother and your sister and forgive them for their ignorant acts and that is faith that's once delivered unto the saints see when the book of acts let's go to isaiah isaiah sometimes i get a little excited don't pray for me isaiah 53 and one he said who i believed i report and to whom the arm of the lord has been revealed for he should grow up before him as a tender plant and a root out of dry ground he had no form or comeliness and when we should see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men see he was rejected for you and i he was despised for you and i but yet he opened not his mouth he didn't see anything because of the way he went because he went for you and i he took the cross and he took it willingly and he took it and forgive them that put him there and when people put you at calvary and they kneel you to the cross of not being a christian or not loving you just begin to forgive them see you got to look over a person ignorance sometimes it begin to be stupidity but you have to look over it why because the forgiveness of god is in you by the baptism of the holy ghost it's the holy ghost that produces the faith that was once delivered unto the saints and that is the faith and be faith tonight if we if god held by the help of god the faith is the holy ghost inside of you that produces forgiveness that it produces love see your faith must produce love what's first faith virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness charity if these things be in you and abound they should neither make you barrel no and fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ so you got to look at your enemy you got to look at your brothers and sisters and said i'm going to forgive until it hurts because you will be tested on every hand to show forth that that holy ghost that you say you got it's gonna be tested it's harvest time now look what he says he is despised and rejected a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as if it were our faces from him we esteemed him not surely i burned our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he would bruise fire with nicoties the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed so when he was whipped you was healed when he was whipped you was healed of your sick sin condition he took your beating tonight he was he forgive them that beat him for you he was beaten for you and i but yet he forgave them because he saw you and i he saw the bride the lamb's wife and that's what he saw and when he saw you he said i'll take anything for you lord i take anything for you bride why and if you got the same spirit as romans 9 and 10 says if the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead if it dwell in you it he that raised up christ shall also quicken your mortal bodies what kind of quickening we looking for tonight are we looking for the supernatural are we looking for a life that's clean and pure before god because that's what we got to produce a clean pure life and that's what brings the faith that was once delivered unto the saints we all like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord have laid on him the iniquity of us all so who tonight can be angry or biased against somebody because if you have accepted his forgiveness then you got his faith and his faith can forgive your brother it can forgive your sister it can forgive your enemy i'm not talking about nobody in here but your enemy tonight is the devil and he can get in anybody in the world and test your faith tonight that was once delivered unto the saints he's going to test you why because this is harvest time harvest time i like harvest time because it mean i get to the end i don't have to work no more in the natural harvest time when you got five or ten acres of garden harvest time is the best time when you get everything out the field you ain't got to worry about going back to next year but it's harvest time now what's harvest time harvest time now is you're going to either produce the supernatural are you not you're going to have the faith or you not it is no in between you either got faith now are you not acts 2 and 1. acts 2 and 1. and see to have the faith the faith you must have the holy spirit it takes the holy spirit to forgive if you can't forgive you don't have the holy ghost because forgiveness starts with love you got the first love god to forgive your brother and see jesus had a god pay love that's why he could forgive them that whipped him he could forgive them that nailed his hands into the the post and his feeding to the post he could forgive them his own enemies and you don't have to go there but acts 7 51 the bible says stephen looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw jesus sitting on the right hand of god and said father forgive them for they know not what they do they throw them out of the city and begin to bash his head in the ground but he said that verse i think 40 something he said you stiff neck and uncircumcising heart you do always resist the holy ghost just like your father do so so them that want the holy ghost tonight and them that have it they can forgive and love and they won't complain about it their love without without any problem acts two and one and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all in one place and one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and sat upon each of them and they were all all filled with the holy ghost filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues that the spear gave them utterance and they were dealing dwelling at jerusalem devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was gnaws abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in their own language just because they spoke in tongues they didn't have the holy ghost but the bible said they spoke with tongues after the holy ghost came upon them now let's go to verse 32. he said this jesus have god raised up where we are witnesses see when you got the holy ghost you are a witness tonight you are a witness of faith tonight when you have the holy ghost we are witnesses witnesses of what of a christian life witnesses of the resurrection that's what we are witnesses of we're not just coming to church we are a witness tonight glory to god i'm supposed to have two families tonight come with uh visit to me tonight but one of his wife got home late and he said it was coming but the lord knows all things the lord knows all things y'all just pray for them we have bible study with them on monday friday saturday and mondays y'all pray for our strength in the lord because it's got to be jesus you got to build a foundation a platform you got to let people know it's jesus and jesus alone they want to make him anything but i want to make him jesus christ the same yesterday today in favor he's the lord above us he's jesus with us and he's christ in us the holy spirit and once he comes inside of you you don't have to worry about him leaving you no more once he comes inside of you then you got the power to have faith and you got the power to forgive wonder why brotherly kindness is at the top so close to the top of the ladder in the pyramid because that's what peter had to do he said lord increase my faith he went all the way back to the first part of the pyramid of faith but jesus was trying to put him at the sixth piece which was brotherly kindness he said if your brother offends you you got to forgive him jesus is just talking about a brother forgiving you not not an enemy doing you wrong but a brother forgiven you he said how many times i got to forgive him lord he said unto seven times seven no no no no seven times seventy you got to forgive him but he didn't have the holy ghost in but after he got the holy ghost then he said you men of israel hawking unto my words these men are not drunk as ye suppose seeing is the third hour of the day but this is that which is spoken by the prophet joel that in the last days said god i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young men should see vision your old man's your dream tree and upon my handmaids and upon my servants i'll pour out my spirit that's what we're looking for tonight god to pour out his spirit if you've been filled we need a refilling we need a refilling of the holy ghost god brought your spirit upon all men that the sons and daughters shall prophesy we can't make it with dr holy ghost you can't get past first first base without the holy ghost you must be born again you must be born out of water only but by the spirit you must have a birth in your soul that anchors you and seals you into the kingdom and now you ready to be adopted but we can't be adopted if we sit in there worrying about somebody say about us stephen they whipped him they bashed his head in they had to let paul down in a basket because they were trying to kill him but paul the bible said he was stoned and left dead outside the city and the bible said when he came back through i believe the holy ghost wake got him back up when he came back through what did he do he he went jumping and leaping into the next city to tell somebody about jesus he got up went to the next city to preach jesus so if you despise tonight if you reject it tonight know that you're god's children notice you're a child of god people get all up tight when somebody do something do them wrong or talk about them or say something about them that is part of your character building get with the program this is a test of the american broadcast system this is only a test and you got to pass it but you first must be born again with the holy ghost not on your flesh not on your spirit but down in your soul where you're anchored in the word you will not reject none of the word when the holy ghost come now and that is your seal and getting you ready for adoption jesus on mount transfiguration i'm getting off my sermon now matthew 17. peter said let's make three tabernacles one for moses one for elijah and one for thee and it came down and said jesus only he been accepted the bible said the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man so now he'd been accepted and he had power without measure so he could go about doing all signs and wonders so no matter somebody spitting his face it was all right with him nobody somebody whipped him it was all right with him if you see that casket laying down in front of the church right here don't matter what somebody how much they cry no matter how much tears come no matter how much they kiss him in touch he ain't gonna say nothing because he didn't transfer to the other side and you as a christian paul said if i live i live in christ and if you live tonight you live by the faith of the son of god that died for you there it is too and this jesus whom god raised up wherever we are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of god exalted having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear for david is ascended into the heavens but he said himself the lord said unto my lord sit down thy right hand until i make thy foes that footstool therefore let all the house of israel know surely that god had made this same jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ see my bible still denies that this is one lord people have been taught all kind of ways but paul said i've laid the foundation of the earth and paul said if a man built upon this foundation you better watch how you build hey stubble whatever you build has got to be built upon jesus christ because acts 4 and 12 that says none other name under heaven given among men whereby you must be saved by the name of jesus it ain't yahshua it ain't rosa sharon it ain't father son holy ghost it's jesus christ paul they act like they didn't want to they didn't understand about baptizing john the baptist paul passing through the upper coast of essex acts 19 he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe he's we're not ever heard in the holy ghost he said then were you baptized under john the baptist baptism of repentance saying it's your weight on him which has come after him which is christ the lord and they baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ and at the power of the name of jesus your faith in jesus name tonight demons got to flee demons got to go tonight in the name of jesus and when you call the name of jesus there's power in that name there's victory in that name there's forgiveness in that name there's faith in that name there's love in that name when you call it but what anchors your what anchors when you call it if your heart is right and it must be the holy ghost in your heart it must be the baptism of the holy ghost in your heart because we know as humans we know ourselves each individual know ourselves where we stand with god and it must be by faith and that of works not only but it's the gift of god therefore let all the house of israel know surely that god had made the same jesus whom he crucified both lord and christ and now when they heard this they were pricked in their what hearts and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent become godly sorry don't just hear the preacher from sunday to sunday no repent become repent and be godly sorry and as you repent you will repent until you leave here just because you got the holy ghost it don't mean you shouldn't repent no more all you're doing is fortifying that spirit of god in you the bible say pray in your most holy faith praying in the what holy ghost so sometimes god had to clean his stuff off the side of us you know the gold sometimes get a little dross on it gotta be polished and prayer polishes that goal then peter said unto them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you unto your children to them that are fallen even as men as the lord our god shall call our children need the holy ghost they can't make it with that in this time now children cannot make it without the holy ghost we got to get on our knees and pray with them sometimes they run up next thing you know they're grown but they still need the holy ghost they might don't pray richard but you pray for them you pray for them that god don't god if god's hearing your prayers and that is the faith that was once delivered unto the saints you're not stopping praying because they're growing you're still praying for them and then the holy ghost hit them holy ghost hit him wherever they at the holy ghost just hit him wow glory to god next thing you know you see him running around you see him mama and daddy are ready to come to church that is the faith that was once delivered under the saints acts 9 and 5. and he said who out there lord and the lord said i'm who i'm jesus whom thou persecuted it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks and he trembling and astonish said lord what would thou have me to do see when you get the holy ghost then you're gonna ask god what you're gonna have me to do for you when you get the holy ghost you're not just going to find something in the church to do you're going to ask the lord what will you have me to do i know sometimes when you get you go to the denomination of churches and you get saved and it's what the d can tell you your dues and all that stuff uh-uh lord what will you have me to do what will you have me to do every day you should ask the lord lord what will you have me to do what can i do lord for the kingdom and we can't get old and say we just coming in and out of the church we're just hearing the pastor no lord what will you have me to do and god set you on fire with something to do then now you part of the kingdom look what he says and saul arose and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him unto damascus and he was three days without sight and neither did eat or drink and there was a certain man certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord and his lord said unto him arise go in the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of judas one called saul of tarsus for behold he what prayer see after god doesn't stop paul saul now he praying he's the lord what were you having to do now he without sight three days and he praying god what will you have me to do now look what happens and he seen any vision and the man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight and ananias ananias was scared of that paul saul i have heard by this man of how evil he have done to thy saints at jerusalem and here he have authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on his name see it's coming back to that point that's what's going to bring the faith tonight when they're buying you for calling on the name of jesus when you can't have services in a setting like this you won't be able to have this service after a while and then your faith is going to be tested then it's going to be the faith you're going to put people in jail they're going to do all kind of stuff and then you got to be ready then because when they put paul and silas in prison in acts 16 the bible said they sang praises under god and the foundation of the prison bars was sheikah amen see god has to get us in a condition that now the faith is coming out of us but it must be the holy ghost in you to bring the faith out of you the faith was once delivered unto the saints when they took jesus the disciples walked with him three years and a half and all of them they didn't know him they left him they left him he said you'll deny me three times but after you convert it strengthen your brother if you can't take somebody persecuting you not in the church or in the world what you gonna do when they come against the church what you gonna do then you got to have it now you got to have per you got to be able to let people persecute you now and that's what's going to increase your faith right now we're not playing games now this is real business this is serious business all the plan is bought over when they turn away from you ukrainian it could turn on us amen they're already killing christians in other countries already because of the name of jesus when they turn on you what a free democracy it won't be free after a while you can't say and do what you want you can't say nothing about certain people now that don't change or flip or transgender you can't say nothing not in the public and don't get locked up look what he says let's go to verse 17. and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way and as thou came us has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the and immediately there fell from his eyes as he'd been scales and he received sight at full with and arose and was baptized and when he had received meat he was strengthened then then was saw certain days with the disciples which were at damascus and then after that he began to preach jesus he began to preach jesus but let's go back to luke 24. luke 24 and 25. see these people didn't have the faith that they should have see sometimes we can be in the church and we ain't got the faith that we need we're just going to read is going along but look what happened luke 24 and 25 then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken see we got to see what have been spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded in all the scriptures of things concerning him it ain't two gods it ain't three gods it's one god the things concerning himself he expounded unto them the things concerning himself so he began to tell them hey look in the scriptures look in the word this thing is concerning me i've already suffered you're going to have to suffer also and you're going to have to forgive the unforgivable you're going gonna have to be blessed you're gonna have to bless them that catch you you're gonna have to love them that hate you you're gonna it's gonna take that kind of faith that take you into the next dimension that now you walking in the very presence of the anointing of jesus christ you're walking by the very power of forgiveness tonight and everyone that has died that had the holy ghost they had supreme deity of forgiveness and love in their heart because they know it was time to transfer over so when somebody spit in your face somebody do you wrong dar is over there we worked together years ago holy spirit had me fasting for seven days i don't know why but during that time sister dars can tell you me and this guy working together he slapped me the holy spirit said that's why i had you faster just go ahead don't take it brother god bless you love him anyway and i just went on by my business that's the enemy and somebody but i'm saying god has to show us where we get into then we get to the point where somebody do what's wrong then we ain't the way we thought we was we ain't where we say we are in christ you know so i ain't gonna say none of y'all said but i got some people at the job they hired me at this page and i look at my paycheck a month or two later and it ain't where it's supposed to be i said man i'd make sure my paycheck right before i take the job but that's how some people are see god send tests to you and as you fail the test god sent it back again so somebody come to slap you or spit on you or talk about your children i talk about your mama or daddy prophet they talk about the prophet mama he said the man didn't mean it and then he he said he didn't mean it then he come then he went around and said yeah he he he didn't mean it but i forgive him anyway the man couldn't even turn the prophet on the man talking about his mama but what if somebody talked about one of your children say something about them or say something about your church or say something about your daddy see god the devil nowhere to turn it on and off with you or talk about your house or anything your job or anything the devil know where to turn it off and turn it on with you but you got to be to the point now that your holy ghost doing the forgiveness where it doesn't make a difference my eyes are set as a flint toward calvary i saw he forgave me for my sins and my shortcomings i saw what he did for me and what he did for me should transform you into the very image of the resurrection it must transform you into a place that no matter what somebody say or do to you should harm you but you know what at first you said i forgive them then the devil brother josh just get you to thinking about it a week later why did he did that to me the next thing you know he done made it into a goliath you forgive him at that point but the devil bring it back to your remembrance you know what you shouldn't take that you don't know who you are you're a great man see that's a problem with people they think they're great they think they're great see the devil want you to think you're great you're somebody big but you ain't nothing you're not nothing none of us are nothing and as long as you can stay nothing then the devil can't move you never can never thought he was a great man and god made him back to eat grass as a oxen he took his mind and everything then when god gave it back to him he said now i extolled the lord see when you begin to think that you something i didn't read it in my book of forgiveness but that's the way the devil get us when you think you somebody because you got education or you got a statues or whatever then that's what the devil worked with when you think you're somebody i'm the pastor i'm the bishop i'm a minister of jesus christ you know how long i've been ministering and they did me did that to me let them do it because ain't nothing on this earth is yours everything is yours in heaven don't worry about what they did to you here cause all your treasures is in heaven that's where your treasures are so don't worry about what they do to you you know they might open the door and bump your car man i'm sorry hitting your car man don't worry about this end up with a piece of metal you see what i'm saying don't worry about those things the more you begin to dip into that love that love began to anchor your faith in the very promises of the resurrection and now you're not seeing like a hawker buzzard you're seeing like an eagle a hawker buzzer can see anything on the ground because they're looking below the clouds but you are eagle all you can look down and see is clouds of glory man you're looking at clouds of glory but if you're a hawk you're on the telegram pole looking down you can see everything rats and turtles and snakes and everything but the eagle flies above the clouds and the eagle can forgive unconditionally eagle represents a prophetic anointing and that's what we are under a prophetic anointing and if you under that your prophet is jesus [Applause] amen luke 13 and i'mma close i can't finish tonight and i'll go on to the end get to the end luke 13 and 7. he said then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i've been in the church three years and ain't got the holy ghost i've been in the church three years i ain't got the holy ghost these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find it none cut it down why cumbereth hit the ground and he answered and said unto the lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig around it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not there after that thou shalt cut it to the ground i wonder what he's digging for see you got to get down on your knees and dig in prayer that that same faith that was once delivered unto the saints you got to just not a dry eye prayer you got to pray until something takes place glory to god that you can put your cell phone down that you can put your ipad down that you can put your television down that something takes you to a level that now you are digging into the very promises of the resurrection you know i tell the guys at work i said if y'all can pray first i told myself y'all could do mechanic work like y'all to do with them phones i said no you got the wrench in one hand and you got the phone in the other hand now how does that look can you do any work like that you can't do no work like that you can't do no work looking at the phone phone in one hand wrenching other hand i said put that phone down you're gonna get run off with the phone in your hand they can't set it down for a minute see the devil knows what he is doing to occupy our mind i tell every young person if you can pray as much as you look at that screen if you can pray as much as you look at that fiend and your faith will be once delivered unto the saints see faith takes you to a realm outside of the corner see you not worrying about what's on that stream once your faith gets to a certain level of inspiration it channels you into the supernatural see it's so much stuff on there that we need to see but god has so much stuff he wants to do with us god has so much stuff he wants us to do guy said man you left your phone home i said that's fine i don't know where mine was at some time the lady called from kroger so i went to get some food and the lady said mr day's a dollar number and we answered the phone i said that my phone she said yeah it's your phone you left it in a buggy in the parking lot i said glory to god i said i'll be there tomorrow to get it she ain't coming now that's not coming now it's already night i'll be there tomorrow i have to work to get it she said oh goodness you must be almost 50 years old i said yes ma'am i said i'll come and get it tomorrow after work just put it up i'll come and get it but see god by sovereign grace your faith is going to be translated into the supernatural because of the obstacles that is against you when god sees that you rather pray than look at your phone you rather pray than look at play games you rather prayed and do these things then now that's what see god already knew before the foundation the world what we'll be up against in this age with the young people but the holy ghost is able to sustain us the holy ghost is able to get us there by a supernatural intervention he's able to get us there into a place of the resurrection he's able to get us there one last scripture galatians 5 and 22. he's able to get us that d faith [Music] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against their against such there is no what law there's no law and they that are crisis have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust see they that are crisis have crucified see nothing controls you but christ now not the cell phone not the car not the house but christ controls you now cause the flesh and the lust have been crucified now that's powerful if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desires of vain glory provoking one another envying one another see if we walk in the spirit we walking in the spirit then the things of the flesh don't bother us see you have and see the faith is gonna get you there the faith is gonna get you i said lord let me teach this tonight as best i can because if i get excited i i go off where i i don't want to go sometimes i get off i can i don't get my point across but the faith the faith is the holy ghost tonight the baptism of the holy ghost put the faith once delivered unto the saints because they didn't have the faith until the day of pentecost and then after the day of pentecost then the faith was once delivered unto them and they went about doing all things look what they told the sanhedrin council they said we ought to obey man than god peter began to let them know this man that was healed we ought to obey man god than man they was looking for they said now you whip them and you beat them because they don't call jesus name again and the bible said they were beat and it was whipped and they went rejoicing because they what it was whipped for the name of jesus and they went in the next city they see the synagogue didn't we just not let tell you don't say no name of jesus because in the power in the name of jesus but their faith the faith made them anchor the very promises of the resurrection so as your faith tonight the faith is anchored by the baptism of the holy ghost and when it anchors your faith you're ready to go to the next level and guess what the first thing you're gonna do is forgive because you're going to be despised and rejected you're going to be beat you're going something's going to happen to us and we got to be able to know that we at a certain level in god to withstand it now stephen in acts 6 7 and 51. look what happened to him they bashed his head and threw it about to sit the bible said they stopped their ears they didn't want to hear no more what he was saying he stopped the ears and ran unto him with one accord threw him out the city and beat him bash his head in with rocks and stones and they're doing the same thing to paul so what are we coming to just another great church service or are we doing what the preacher is saying are we really living it and manifesting it oh he'll preach it before you get out the door you're mad with somebody some days it's gonna be over after a while we got the love with a passion and the only way you're gonna love with a passion it's got to be a prayer you got to dig in in prayer until the holy ghost call amen i ain't getting mad with people that i have bible study with i just see where they they're not where they need to be at and they ask questions constructive criticism is great because you want to answer a person's questions because you don't you want them to get god where they need it because it's going to come a time where marriages is not successful families is not successful they can't make it under the screen and the pressure that the devil is going to bring to them families is going to be the star toss to and fro why because they didn't dig in in prayer to sustain their families by the power of the faith son i forgive you son i love you daughter i love you even though they are wrong the devil looking for you to be angry with them but if you show them perfect love glory to god that's what brings up but if you said bruh son you did this you did this you did that you did that always finding what he done wrong or she done wrong instead of looking at what she's done right jimmy you're going to look at what she's done right and that only not works with your children it works with your wife your husband and the church members find out what they do good instead of always beating them up and say what they've done wrong so we help us of one another because god forgave all of us from sin amen and that is the grace and power of the resurrection and that's leaders leaders ain't always looking at what you did wrong the superintendent said man everybody want to work with you he said why that's cause they never do no wrong when they're with me they ain't gonna take up no equipment they make all the mistakes they can make they say well what you think what do you think uh preacher can i try this i said yeah try as long as it's in the bounds of getting the equipment back going then they see where they fall on their face now let's do it my way now you don't have your way now go ahead and do it this way and they find out it worked right you said i'm saying a leader a great leader had been a great follower a great follower will become a great leader because i ain't always know everything and neither do you so let's work together for the kingdom's sake god bless you brothers [Applause] [Applause] him i i prayed with him in the back i told him i said the lord must have wanted you to preach tonight i said brother gordon called me first i worked in midnight last night got up and went to work today brother gordon called me and was like brother i'm i'm trying to get that the devil was in my way the whole time i said don't worry about it i got a couple of songs on my heart anyway so and then he i says you know i'm about to go out there right now a little bit an hour or so that was about five o'clock something like that no since i got the phone on him so i'll let call call broke down out there on 20 up by camden i said oh lord so i called and said josh you might have to leave us on service today we're gonna be there got there and i prayed on the way there i said lord lord if we get there just let it be something simple god you know so we got there and it wasn't really simple but was able by the grace of god to get back up here so i thank the lord for that but i just said that you know the devil's he's in he gets in your way all the time but why because maybe it's a i know it's a blessing there so you still gotta press i i didn't wanna hug brother carl i got smud all over my hands so i put it all the back his shirt but god knows anyway don't he you know it's something about that what he was talking about love i was sharing with um last sunday and i was telling my wife i'ma say it i said you know uh i think sister dale shared with me a while back that in in the black homes the males don't tell their sons they love them it says majority of them don't and that's a problem and they never get that affection from their dads so i thought about that and i told my dad i said i ain't never heard you say you love me i told my daddy that and you know he's still there saying he told me he said you know i do boy ain't got to tell you that i said you told bricktale britain or rachel all the time i never heard you say you love me never ever he still has said it right but last last week i told charlotte he called me by accident then i called him back he was like he's just talking and he just said son you know i love you he just kept saying you know i love you i thought maybe something was wrong but i said i you know that really felt good to hear him say that and uh i don't think he even realized that maybe if he see the tape you know i told charlotte i wasn't gonna say that to him but he actually told me he loved me and i felt good when he told me he loved me you know it means a lot to hear somebody say they love you you know how you think god god feels when you tell him you love him have you told god you love him lately you know his brother carl was preaching i was thinking also about you know that love you know the prophet of god was saying i said it about a week or so ago the prophet of god i was reading something he said the church people struggle with forgiveness he said they struggle with it he said he said they run so many people away from the church because they won't forgive them he says instead of instead of rallying and everybody rallying together and try to restore such a one he said they get to talking he said in the way he says they get going about this and that and he says that what does that do run them away he said they struggle with forgiveness he said the reason why they do because they never really experienced it they self and i believe that with all of my heart you know god got to show you yourself we see each other all the time but god got to show you yourself he got to show you how much of a critic you are and how you see everybody else fault but you didn't look you couldn't you couldn't look at yourself somebody else got to tell you your faults or god got to let you look down he got to let you look where he brought you from you know uh from the way down you know i always say if he had he had to reach way down some of y'all say he had to reach down and pick you all up well he had to reach 10 times further down to get me up but when i think about that forgiveness then i said lord how can i hold something against anybody when what you did for me people make mistakes how can i hold it against anybody when i know what you did for me if god would show you a tenth of some of the rightness that was in my life come on i i wouldn't i'm not even worthy to be a a be called a minister of the gospel but it's a little word called grace come on the bible says by grace are ye saved through what faith not of works i was ministering last week about i was talking about martin luther and how he did all those rituals working and working and working but he come to the conclusion that god was so holy you could never work enough to please him you couldn't work enough to get your way into heaven he said he he had this thing nagging him but then he said when he began to study the scriptures then he came up with his revelation that the just shall live by faith he said from there the gates of heaven was opened to him because he realized that it ain't by your works but it's in it's by your faith and what he already done for you come on nothing that you can do you can't live good enough i don't care how how much you come to prayer how much you come to church how many times you paid you can't live good enough it's not not of works unless any man should boast but he came down by grace you deserve to die come on i deserve to die and go to hell but what did god do he said i'm gonna give i'm gonna extend my grace to him the grace that he has extended to us come on and all we got to do is have faith don't you know the accusers standing there accusing you but remember i ain't got to stand for my own self i'm looking at that blood hallelujah the blood that was shed for me that's what that that's where i'm at right there the blood come on hallelujah the blood do y'all believe that tonight oh jesus come on you know i was thinking when my sister was passing away the lord had showed me she was going to pass away and one night i didn't have the words to say to her she was telling me she was ready to go and i asked brother simmons could he come up to and talk to her at the hospital and you know one of those key moments first thing he began to talk to her about was love he said you ready she said yeah he said okay he said what i want you to do because a lot of people say they're ready but they still got stuff in their heart come on he says but what you need to get your mind on right now it's love he said because nothing short of that it's like real prophet god said nothing short of that gonna get over there all these other things now don't matter are you ready to meet god come on you need to get your heart right that was a key moment uh nothing else don't no nothing else matters nothing in this world matter you know when you go to meet god nothing ain't gonna matter how much money you got ain't gonna matter how many friends you got ain't gonna matter i was at a funeral and the guy's reading the thing let it be known she was a faithful member she was this she was that that ain't gonna matter none of that ain't gonna matter you don't need jesus blood the blood gonna have to speak for you come on ain't gonna be like about here you work hard what did you do come home uh-uh the blood gonna have to speak for you and i'm so glad tonight by the grace of god that i've experienced that blood that nothing else don't matter come home life nor death power all nothing can't separate you from the love of god that's in christ how many believe that tonight don't don't make you want to just raise your hands don't it and say lord thank you lord i love you lord i appreciate you i couldn't lift myself up god you lifting me up and i thank you for that grace just comes down come on holy ghost just fills your heart with joy nothing can't shake you cause you know you crossed over hallelujah how'd you get there the holy ghost carried you there didn't he oh i'm on my way to heaven and i'm enjoying the trip come on by grace do you believe that tonight come on i i thank the lord for the word we heard tonight i i believe we heard a powerful word come on the faith that was once delivered the faith come on what was the faith that they did the faith that what what did the first the early church preach they preached the risen christ risen jesus christ not a dead one but they preached a risen one and they demonstrated it through love that's how they did it do y'all believe that tonight we can say a lot of things from my mouth but actions speaks a whole multitude come on and i say that the man that's you don't have to prove you love you prove prove you're trying to prove it because it ain't genuine but when it's genuine you know love is correction too now it ain't just always off give my love you forgive them but love is also telling that person where they're wrong telling them helping them y'all believe that tonight come on i believe that with all of my heart i'm just so i'm stirred tonight so i thank the lord y'all y'all got something to thank the lord for tonight i know you do hey man we appreciate our
