seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life and behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple amen may the Lord bless the reading of his [Music] [Music] word man our New Testament scripture reading be coming from 2 Corinthians 5 amen for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so being that clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life now he that have wrought us for the selfs same thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whil we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord amen [Music] amen bow heads father in the precious name of the Lord Jesus we come humbly but boldly to the

[Music] Amen good afternoon can you hear me afternoon family good afternoon so I wrote some things about my Uncle [Applause] [Music] Frank bear with me one of my earliest moments of my childhood with my Uncle Frank was in the early 90s when he used to come to my grandmother's house and fellowship with the family now around this time I'm about 8 or N9 years old and I know my Uncle Frank is you know my Uncle Frank Sierra's Dad I'm Betty's husband but on this one particular day Uncle Frank pulls up in a gold Nissan 280Z and he's handing out money and of course me being a young bro young man I am I'm right there next to my uncle prank Uncle Frank is talking to me and most of my cousins about being a man and being making our own way so you ask me what do I know around eight or n years old about giving game and I would tell you I had no idea but it at this moment in my life I realized that my Uncle Frank was the man Uncle Frank would often talk to us about working hard as a man doing the right thing how it would always pay off but ultimately making smart decision is and having Integrity would always keep us ahead of the game he not only told us how to be good men he showed us there were always times where my Uncle Frank showed up and always gave the best advice he was one of the most important pillars in my life and I highly respected him I remember the first time I I bought a new car and he spoke to me about integrity again about maintaining the in the field of what I own about not letting any and everyone work on my car even though it might be a little cheaper also about how not letting any and everyone inside of it too often as men we don't get our flowers but in the same way I feel that flowers from one man to another they come in forms of handshakes and I like to think every time I saw my Uncle Frank I gave him his flowers maybe not in the form of beautiful bouquets but in firm handshakes always confirming the thank yous yeah I appreciate you yeah I see you for not only simply showing the way but leading the way at every term of my life I always knew if I needed some advice I could make a trip to go find my Uncle Frank whether he was in the restaurant he on with Uncle Pete arounded around town in that stinking Lincoln I always knew I could count on Uncle Frank to deliver a word that word would always be encouraging it always would have integrity and it always will make you feel seen and understood I will miss those words I will miss those conversation that often started with now Jonathan let me tell you something but most of all I'll miss my Uncle Frank our Uncle Frank thank you Sierra for sharing your father with us thank you aun Betty for not only understanding that he was what you needed for what we needed Uncle Frank I love you thank

Pilgrim Baptist Church in lugol South Carolina greetings to the pull pit members I met Frank asman better known as asman from the South Carolina Department of Corrections I think back in 1988 he became one of my best friends I'm really going to miss him even though we didn't talk as much I'll still give him a call here and there but I remember the days when we would get off at work um off from work at 300 p.m. we'll stay out there till 5:00 p.m. talking and he'll say Grant I got to get out of here cuz Betty going to kill me if I don't go pick up big girl better known as Sierra and she

to go back and I says brother-in-law and I go way back I said he planned for boogery Washington my plan for CA Johnson we were rivals in the city of Columbia and um then to come together CA Johnson and boogery Washington we fellow soldiers in the army of the Lord [Applause] I thought about the word impact I said to my children I said each one of y'all could tell some stories about your uncle and the impact that he had on their lives I used to than him I said when talking to my sons Rachel and him just had a different she was say something and she know he's getting ready to say hold that th so she would say something and she know all right Uncle Frank all right she she knows how to get next to him and my son says I told him often times I said Thank you thank you for helping my children the impact that he had on their lives he would always try to see where they at and what's going on with them not only did he do my children like that if you came to bride Tabernacle and anywhere if you knew him he would he just wouldn't miss children he always wanted to say something and what's going on what's what you going through and what you doing with your life so he always talked to them about as Jonathan said he wanted he was concerned about them and they could see and often times they said Daddy Uncle Frank this and Uncle Frank that I said yeah I said and that's why I would go back to him and said thank you thank you it's so many things but just to have somebody [Music] I remember in ' 83 and the beginning of ' 84 I came to columia came back home past down in Maran County all that time and I came back home and I came back home and I had something that Colombia as a whole had never heard same Bible same gospel but columia as a whole hadn't heard from the angle and I said to brother Frank now he's going to hold you and make sure you with the book now you know a lot of people just go to church they don't study they're not checking out the preacher if I said something I said brother Frank Frank said hey [Music] wait what you say you said what I said did I say it like that he said yeah but you know you can't talk like that to God's [Music] people I said okay I said well I got to I I'm sorry I better make sure I get it straight you know sometimes you know he kept you in check you just couldn't do anything say anything around him am I I don't care who you were he going to come up to you and talk to you he had that boldness about him so when I came to Colombia Frank he studied he he checked things out you're not just going you going you're not going to tell him anything and when he got through checking he was introducing me to family members come and see aun so and so on come and see and then I was able to share the good news that the Bible here is open to me now I got something I want everybody to know people have been reading this Bible I I read it backwards and forward but now I got something I want to share he said oh Lord you got something that's different no it's it's the same Bible it's in the Bible but seems like folks ain't preaching it so it was stories like Sarah and Abraham had become young people and they were 99 years old and they was going to have a child but I didn't know looking back that the king wanted to have Sarah so Abraham told a lie told her tell the king you my sister are you with me and God was getting ready to kill him now how come a king want a 90 year old lady a king don't want to marry a 90y old lady going to take your bride from you she was turned young again and because she was young again it's showing you what's in store for you and I God got a new [Music] body God got another body brother Frank going to be young again are you with me you say I knew that all the time I I didn't you see it's just nuggets all over the Bible do you know that when people were looking for Jesus he was already there but the they know it they read their Bibles backwards and forwards and they studed the word and they didn't even recognize Jesus when he came matter of fact they told Mary she was lying cuz they told Jesus we be not born of fornication so they didn't believe he was virgin birth are you with me amen so most people when it comes down to Revelation and Truth they don't believe it they just go to church and feel good but whether or not they understand what's going on for the hour that we live in have no clue they all right I just go to church I will be good God going oh yes that's what's wrong brother Frank wasn't like that he studied the word you know a lot of people come to church even to this church they don't study you can preach all you want all they do not brother Frank you you you you going to come out the book and you going to come right amen are you with me amen I got a close see they my family pray for me so hard they pray that I don't make y'all mad see cuz when Jesus uh uh when he spoke he was plain and he was simple but they didn't like it why because he told them told them the truth are you with me it we had an hour wait there's another football player there call them the truth oh you a when it come down the truth you know folks think I'm I want the truth come on come on you want somebody to tell you you all right when you know you're wrong I'm all right I love the Lord heard my prayer I don't doubt till he heard your prayer the devil believe is one God and he what Tremors ain't that right so I don't want you to feel comfortable being a [Music] sinner and I don't want you to feel comfortable sinning yeah and I don't want you to shut my mouth cuz I won't be I remember somebody bought a shotgun they going to blow my head out I said come on Lord I think I'll go to heaven now cuz I was ready to go I was just a young in my 20s and I said oh I made somebody so mad they going to blow my head off you know sometimes you you know as a young preacher I us like to make people mad because if I don't make you mad I know you won't get nothing but now got old I want to make you happy I don't want to make nobody M I want everybody to be happy now they said boy you don't got weak you used to be a tough preacher now you let everybody by I said no I'm the same preacher but I got more grace now [Music] you you have so much grace with people even when they're wrong yes sir you have more Grace with them y huh straighten up or you can go are you with me so you should be like that y know how you used to be with you got your grandbaby but when your baby uh-uh your child in the grand child get Roy Roy treatment amen why you got weak it's more grace now let me use got a scripture here and um but brother Frank we taught one another he helped me for a long time we were just right he went with me prayed with me if I sometime if I couldn't get the columia I said Frank can you hold it he said I I got it I got it he could teach when you try to make him a preacher nope I'm not a preacher you ain't going to make me do something cuz God ain't call me for that but he stayed in his position wasn't because he couldn't do it he could have done it but he knew he he wasn't called to do it but I thank God for him not many people do that right if you know you okay um St John 11th chapter and 11th verse let me just let's bow for a moment father in Jesus name thank you for Betty thank you for Sierra thank you for Pete and Georgia and the family God and Father I just pray that today Lord that they'll find confid in knowing that brother Frank by the grace of God what we believe that he's all right father May these that are gathered here Lord today Lord God to be support to this family and those that brother Frank has impacted their lives I pray God that his life would be a light and a testimony I pray that today the words that are spoken will help somebody to draw closer to Jesus and father if we're not right that we'll get right cuz one day Jesus is coming and we want to be ready bless your word now in Jesus name amen amen 1111 thank John 1111 and these things he said after that he he said unto them our friend laders is what sleepeth hm but I go that I may what wake him out of sleep man sleep y'all leave him alone ain't it said I'm going to wake him up are you with me then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he what so as brother Marcus said if he sleep he doeth well so I said to the family he do it well amen if he sleep he do it well and then said Jesus unto them plainly lus is what okay I still skip the verse yeah that's all [Music] right when you pass 35 second time you skip a verse my children get at me while I get at me I said that's all right I just give a verse sometime and he and then he says he's dead but I'm what glad I'm glad now you know that's a shame he's dead but Jesus said I'm glad amen sometimes those type of statements amen are not understandable at the time but at that time they didn't know amen that Jesus amen because he was glad because he know what he was going to do am so I said to you this afternoon not dead but sleep not dead but sleep I was ministering uh for a while this morning on alive from the dead not dead but sleep in Romans talk about uh reck yourself to be dead indeed under sin and I don't care how young you are or how old you are sir you was born dead cuz the Bible says the wages of sin is and the day you eat of the tree you going to surely die surely die I said man from in Adam all died but in Christ Jesus all should be made alive amen Amen Alive from the dead not dead but sleep you got a choice you can stay dead or you can come [Applause] [Music] alive but the second is yours because Jesus gave you a choice every moral agent you can accept his way out of sin or you can stay in your sin you can let somebody tell you a lie when you know you're not right you can let somebody amen uh try to make you believe and feel good about the way you living when you know you're living amen like a sinner and not a [Music] saint are you with me brother Frank I looked at his life you said well brother Frank wasn't perfect he made mistake some of us ain't making mistake we just s [Music] yeah he made mistakes me too I make mistakes but I don't classify son well I I classify the S but that's some folk lifestyle am that they know they're sinning no they wrong no they have an opportunity to get right with God but what do they do I'm just as holy As You Are I know God just as well as you know him amen thank you Jesus y'all who you think you are Mr Big Stuff some of y'all old folks know what I'm talking about the young folk went over their head but but by the grace of God people think they're high and mighty because uh God answered their prayer amen because God healed them when they sick that's all right when the rain fall he don't just fall on the good person Garden he fall on the wicked too he just don't fall on the seed of the Corn he fall on the weeds too and when they shout all shout [Music] hallelujah all I'm glad for rain so God is a God that causes it rain to fall on the just and the unjust but one thing about it amen if you unjust amen if you don't want to get right on all you going to do is be when the rain fall you praise the Lord for a little while but you're still going to be what you are a sinner that's right are you with me but if some can come down in your heart when God calls somebody Frank was tough he God save him he still stayed tough praise God he ain't take nothing now are you with me amen but you know you know we get along good you know folks that tough you know they get along good CU they understand one another right y going easy going oh come on he had to the brother say he want to be a man let a man be a man amen if you don't let him be a man going be a man anyhow amen am and brother Frank thank God he was a man amen amen I tell you he ain't going to let anything by but folk let everything go all that stuff go oh you look cute come on are you all right no no no no you ain't all right you need to get come on you need to get right I got to go dead H he's not not dead but sleep amen it's something about when a saint we said die he's not dead but he's sleeping that's right see the Bible tells me when
