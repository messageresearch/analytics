[30:38] allowing us to come to the house of
[30:40] prayer tonight Lord and just pray the
[30:42] Lord God that your word would find oh
[30:45] God a place resting place in our hearts
[30:49] Lord God that would touch the sick and
[30:52] Afflicted Lord and oh God restore the
[30:55] backslider cause us oh God
[30:57] Lord God to draw closer to you Lord
[31:00] that's what we want Lord that's what we
[31:02] need Lord may you bless now in Jesus
[31:04] Christ name we thank you
[31:07] amen the book of 2 Corinthians
[31:14] 5 I'm just reading a lot concerning the
[31:17] theophany and where we leave here and we
[31:22] have a
[31:24] body a theopen body
[31:28] and this life
[31:30] here is full
[31:32] of
[31:34] talls said in this world you're going to
[31:37] have tribulation but he said be of good
[31:40] cheer because I've overcome the world so
[31:43] here in 2 Corinthians 5 for we know that
[31:48] if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[31:50] were
[31:51] desire we have a building of God and
[31:54] house not made with hand Eternal in
[31:58] heaven God bless you toward you may be
[32:00] seated house not made with hand
[32:05] amen it was telling me some of the
[32:08] fellows they was telling me that he said
[32:11] three three of our classmates died this
[32:15] week uh within them L I said well you
[32:21] know when it gets around our age people
[32:24] just go go go go go after while just
[32:27] will be a few left amen so life is
[32:35] short a house not made with hand that's
[32:37] what he Paul here
[32:39] says and we know that if our Earthly
[32:43] House of this
[32:45] Tabernacle where Des are we have a
[32:48] building of
[32:50] God and house not made with hands etern
[32:55] in Heavens and the prophet of God you
[32:58] know he told us about going beyond the
[33:00] curtain of time and how he saw that
[33:04] nobody could get there except you got
[33:06] perfect love and he saw the people
[33:09] everybody was
[33:10] young and they came up and greeting him
[33:13] and says my precious
[33:15] brother and um he said the women had on
[33:19] long dresses down to the ankle and
[33:22] everybody was barefooted and so forth
[33:24] and so but by the grace of
[33:28] God you know sometimes you know God
[33:32] shows us things and in our
[33:37] desire we ought the desire to be like
[33:40] Jesus with all our hearts that's what we
[33:42] were saying in His image and his
[33:44] likeness on Sunday in His image and in
[33:47] his likeness that's what God wants us
[33:51] because when Adam and Eve
[33:54] Sinn Man became
[33:57] like a beast like
[34:00] a so the nature of Man
[34:05] became
[34:08] corrupt so the Bible says we needed to
[34:11] be born again not of corruptible seed
[34:14] but Incorruptible seed by the word of
[34:16] God we should live it and abide forever
[34:18] so this corruption he talks about a
[34:22] house not made with hand and in um 1
[34:25] Corinthians 15 a house not made with
[34:28] hand God got something waiting on you
[34:30] and I and um the prophet of God talks
[34:34] about we leave here we go into our
[34:37] theophan body and theophany body and
[34:40] then he says the theop body comes back
[34:43] to pick up the redeemed
[34:46] body in the air and then we
[34:49] change but he says here a lot of times
[34:53] he
[34:54] says the god God made us and uh humans
[35:00] and I made us uh men and women not
[35:04] angels and you know that aboard where
[35:07] the Angels were but God put us here on
[35:10] the
[35:11] earth in this Dimension and he didn't
[35:15] make us Angels made us Sons and
[35:18] Daughters of
[35:19] God are you with me so God made us Sons
[35:23] and Daughters of God but we know that
[35:27] when the saint of God die he said
[35:30] there'll be no marriage and giving in
[35:32] marriage but we'll be like an angels in
[35:34] other words there will be no sexual
[35:36] desire there be no fleshly thing like
[35:38] that are you with
[35:40] me so by the grace of
[35:43] God to this body here that came forth in
[35:49] sin it's groaning it's
[35:53] painting it's striving we strive if
[35:57] we're from above we strive to be like
[36:00] him something in US yearn to be perfect
[36:05] because that's the way God made
[36:07] us so that part of us that genan
[36:12] seed it's a j because we were a part of
[36:16] God's thinking in the beginning and
[36:18] being that way it's a yearning is
[36:22] groaning we desire to go back to be that
[36:26] which
[36:28] God wanted us to be before the
[36:30] foundation of the world but he knew sin
[36:33] would come in but God had a plan to
[36:36] bring us back that's why the lamb was
[36:37] slain in the mind of God before the
[36:40] foundation of the world the purpose of
[36:42] Jesus being slain in the mind of God you
[36:45] know is because he was slain for you and
[36:49] I so uh 1 Corinthians 15 a house not
[36:53] made with hand he
[36:55] says
[37:02] in the 50th
[37:04] verse now this I say Brethren that flesh
[37:07] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[37:10] God I'm going to tell you something we
[37:12] can hold on to all this Flesh and Blood
[37:14] stuff I mean all these Affair it can't
[37:17] enter the kingdom of God that's my
[37:20] brother that's my sister that's my
[37:22] cousin that my family no no no no
[37:25] no
[37:27] we it's only one family and that's the
[37:31] family of God I know you love your loved
[37:34] ones and love your fames nothing against
[37:37] that but I'm going tell you something
[37:38] you can stick so close to that and God
[37:41] will give you what your heart
[37:44] desire when but when a man must forsake
[37:48] father mother sister brother you got to
[37:50] forsake it all to come to
[37:53] Jesus and sometime we think it's all
[37:56] right
[37:58] but sometimes when it comes down to
[37:59] serving God and worshiping God you can't
[38:02] look at I'm taking up from my my brother
[38:04] I'm taking up for my sister I mean this
[38:07] is flesh flesh and blood Affair flesh
[38:10] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[38:13] God and your flesh the only way
[38:19] you you you got to have confidence in
[38:22] this flesh that this flesh it must mean
[38:26] something to you but flesh and blood
[38:28] cannot inherit a king in my father's
[38:31] house he says a many mansion in my
[38:34] father's Kingdom of many pal he said the
[38:37] prophet of God said I I I I knew that
[38:39] God was going away he said it's not
[38:41] going to be stones and Bricks he said uh
[38:44] it it's a body that God has prepared for
[38:47] us so God has prepared uh a a a a temple
[38:52] he said destroy this Temple that's made
[38:54] with hand and I raise it up up in three
[38:57] days he was talking about his body are
[39:00] you with me so this Temple that took 46
[39:04] years was made with hand but destroyed
[39:07] this Temple and I'll raise it up the
[39:09] third day in three days I'll raise it up
[39:11] again so this is this is body this the
[39:14] thing that gets us all mixed up but our
[39:17] affection ought to be on things
[39:19] above but we have all our problems
[39:22] because uh uh the the devil wants to
[39:26] have you and I Conor minded but he said
[39:30] be spiritual minded because nothing in
[39:31] this
[39:32] world matters because you and I are p
[39:36] and strangers we come from God we're
[39:39] going back to
[39:41] God we just spiritual and strangers
[39:43] moving through this land this is not our
[39:47] home this is the prophet of God said
[39:50] this is only a
[39:52] reflection it's a reflection this is not
[39:55] the real you this is a shadow this is
[39:58] just a a temporary
[40:01] thing are you with me but God has a body
[40:05] not made with
[40:07] hand he has a he he he has a spiritual
[40:11] body that would not get sick you don't
[40:13] have to worry about getting old and grhe
[40:15] headed and wrinkled or whatever don't
[40:19] have to worry about pain and sickness
[40:21] why because the God gives you a body not
[40:23] made with
[40:25] hand
[40:27] so I want you to anticipate that and
[40:29] none of this stuff that this de the
[40:31] devil try to get you mixed up tangled up
[40:34] messed up in it ain't even worth
[40:37] it are you with me so get you know your
[40:42] mind Lord I want to please you with all
[40:46] of my heart I want to live for you I
[40:48] want to please you I realize that I got
[40:50] a short time here to be tested and tried
[40:53] and tempted but I know amen it nothing
[40:57] in this world Amen matters because I
[41:00] have a a new Heaven A New
[41:03] World I think God servant say a new
[41:06] world that
[41:08] God a new Heaven A New Earth God got
[41:12] something new amen one that faded not
[41:16] away praise God this would fade away but
[41:20] God got a body that does not fade away
[41:24] are you with me so you don't have to
[41:26] hold on to this thing here this thing
[41:29] here will deceive you amen you'll be
[41:32] looking at the flesh amen and you'll be
[41:34] mining the Flesh and this thing going to
[41:37] Decay even what we possess what uh uh uh
[41:42] money wealth all of that is it it'll
[41:47] corrode fire can burn it the bombs can
[41:51] blow it up a hurricane can sweep it away
[41:55] are you with me but we have one that
[41:58] amen that's why you know when he talks
[42:01] about the house that's built upon a rock
[42:05] and you must be built upon a revelation
[42:08] the revelation of Jesus Christ you must
[42:10] have a revelation of who you are your
[42:12] house is built upon a
[42:14] rock are you with me he said Upon This
[42:18] Rock upon this Revelation I build my
[42:21] church amen you must know who you are he
[42:24] said now we are the what you are Sons
[42:29] and Daughters of
[42:31] God are you with me but you got to
[42:34] realize the god part of you amen yet you
[42:37] battling with this flesh there's a walk
[42:40] constantly going on this flesh wants to
[42:43] have preeminence but God gives you the
[42:45] holy ghost that the flesh might not have
[42:48] dominion over
[42:50] you that's why is very important that we
[42:54] have the baptism of the Holy ghost
[42:56] because it'll keep the devil in
[42:59] subjection it keep the devil under your
[43:03] feet this flesh will not rule you
[43:07] anymore you know I thought about who's
[43:09] living in your
[43:12] house who lives there what kind of
[43:16] spirit resides in
[43:18] you the man said um when Jesus came he
[43:23] said don't come in Tor minut us before
[43:25] the time if you cast us out cast us into
[43:28] the swine who he said Jesus said what's
[43:31] your name he said my name is Legions
[43:33] because we what cuz we're many but who's
[43:36] dwelling in your
[43:38] house he cast Seven Devils out of Mary
[43:42] magaline how many devils are in
[43:45] you if go if if Jesus pass your way how
[43:48] many Devils will he have to cast
[43:51] out you see so who's in your house is is
[43:56] your body the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[43:59] is God is is it God dwelling place is
[44:03] the tent of the house that you have a
[44:07] house not made with hand amen this is
[44:10] what I'm saying to you amen recognize
[44:13] that it must be a present it must be a
[44:16] person that dwells inside of you and
[44:19] that's the person of Jesus Christ in the
[44:21] form of the Holy Ghost amen he must
[44:25] dwell in ins side of your
[44:27] temple and you must you must welcome his
[44:31] presence and amen anything contrary to
[44:35] the word of God Amen it Grieves the very
[44:38] spirit that dwells inside of you and
[44:41] when the spirit is grieved then
[44:43] repentance is immediately amen reacted
[44:47] it comes to conviction and repentance I
[44:50] must repent because I not pleased God
[44:53] and
[44:54] I my body body belongs to
[44:57] him everything I got belong to him so
[45:01] it's a quick we quickly repent because
[45:05] we don't want to be out the will of God
[45:07] we don't want to be out of God's
[45:10] presence he said cast me not away from

[45:31] they don't mind leaving the presence of
[45:33] God I'm not talking about leaving the
[45:35] church but I'm talking about leaving the
[45:37] presence because some people are sat
[45:39] here in the church but they're not in
[45:41] his
[45:42] presence because sin would separate you
[45:45] from
[45:46] him amen but he said in my father's
