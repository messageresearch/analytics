[29:29] flesh and blood but against

[29:36] rulers of darkness of this world against
[29:39] spiritual wickedness in high places

[30:25] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[30:28] the Spirit
[30:29] which is the word of God praying always
[30:32] with all prayer and supplication in the
[30:35] spirit and watching thereunto with all
[30:41] perseverance and supplication for All
[30:44] Saints God lesterenanne of his word in
[30:49] Jesus name the day we want to continue
[30:54] with the message
[30:56] Kadir dealing with the mind and the
[31:02] greatest battle ever fought subtopic
[31:07] control control we realized that there's
[31:15] a battle for power control
[31:19] I'll deal with control as we talked
[31:24] about the battle we talked about the
[31:30] battle that we you and I are facing for
[31:35] yes there is a wall that's taken place
[31:42] that wall Amen you cannot achieve each
[31:47] and every one of us oh we're in a battle
[31:51] and we got to fight in order to survive
[31:58] but you must make up in your mind whose
[32:02] side are you on
[32:05] you must make in your mind and it is
[32:09] searched that you would all have to make
[32:13] whose side am I on
[32:16] I want to ask you a question we're
[32:24] talking about control I want you to
[32:29] think about your life the life that
[32:34] you're not living who's in control
[32:41] but we understand that there's two piles
[32:47] first of all let me talk about control
[32:50] for a minute the definition of control
[32:53] is to have power a ruling of ruling
[33:00] guiding managing to hold back as to
[33:07] control your temper so lose control in
[33:12] your life but what's control in your
[33:19] life for we might mind you but there are
[33:26] many folks today of being controlled by
[33:30] drugs and substance they have lost the
[33:38] ability to function because they're
[33:42] being controlled by alcohol and drugs so
[33:50] who's in control of your life or what's
[33:54] in control greatest battle ever fought
[34:02] there must be a better ground when we
[34:07] are fighting the war there must be a
[34:11] place that the two opposites meet to
[34:19] fight and I said there are only two
[34:23] powers that we are talking about
[34:25] everything else is minor
[34:30] there is Satan and as God there is the
[34:40] power of life and the power of death day
[34:47] is a battle
[34:52] they talked about one of the horse
[34:54] riders riding in the book of Revelation
[34:56] and they talk about different hail was
[34:59] riding in knowledge that's one of the
[35:04] seals and we realized that death and
[35:11] hell riding global communities to our
[35:18] city to our country to the world to
[35:23] powell's not a pattern for control the
[35:29] battleground is and who controls the
[35:36] mind controls the individual and I want
[35:43] you to understand that when something
[35:48] has its controlling you that means that
[35:53] thing or that individual that power
[35:57] embed rules and reigns in your life the
[36:06] Bible tells us in 1st Peter 5 for speed
[36:11] of 5 here it tells us in each the verse
[36:16] 8 first 1st Peter 5 in verse 8 he says
[36:23] be sober be villager because your
[36:31] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[36:36] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[36:42] the Bible tells us in st. John 10 and 10
[36:47] he said I come amen
[36:50] Jesus come that you might have life and
[36:53] that you might have it more abundantly
[36:55] he said but I want you to know that the
[37:00] devil amen
[37:02] he comes amen
[37:46] you have something to fight with weapons
[37:53] in God oh yes brother sisters God is
[38:41] training us giving us the weapon to
[38:45] fight wilt he meant said the weapons of
[38:49] our warfare they're not carnal but
[38:53] they're mighty through God to the
[38:58] pulling down of strongholds yes the
[39:02] devil may have build a stronghold but
[39:07] the weapons of our warfare they pour
[39:12] down to lose they cast down imaginations
[39:20] that exert itself against the knowledge
[39:25] of God God what the Word of God the
[39:41] sword of the Spirit they had the Word of
[39:46] God hallelujah salvation the shame of
[39:53] faith we our walls the fight look like
[40:09] oh wow why are you fighting well yes we
[40:26] are about we must wall Satan cease he's
[40:37] trying to devour but the Bible tells us
[40:41] and Peter here in the ninth verse he
[40:45] said whom resist steadfast in the faith
[40:50] knowing that the same afflictions are
[40:56] accomplished in your brethren that I
[40:59] into Isle
[41:02] amen
[41:04] but the God of all Greece who has called
[41:09] us unto his eternal glory by Christ
[41:15] Jesus after that year of work suffer who
[41:22] we might suffer a little while free
[41:31] Oh somebody call him - undefeated
[41:58] champion never lost the battle he is all
[42:05] back that we can trust and depend on him
[42:12] God when you make the right decision
[42:17] when you make the right choice the right
[42:24] side somebody said the right side oh
[42:34] Jesus master our stands will Jesus come
[42:53] in the night but joy comes in the
[43:00] morning don't be all right God is gonna
[43:12] fetch it here second fire don't worry
[43:17] but your faith in God the battle is
[43:24] region we have battles that take place
[43:29] in our body for their five senses that
[43:36] we have to contend with and those five
[43:41] cents
[43:41] a sight smell hearing taste and touch
[43:54] we have to contend with those five
[43:57] senses and then that's it our bodies to
[44:06] contact the earth and the call to room
[44:10] they met but Satan decide that you make
[44:18] a decision that is going to be let's go
[44:22] back have it in your body
[44:26] st. wants to control your body because
[44:31] your body is the temple of the Holy
[44:34] Ghost
[44:36] so he walked through these five senses
[44:40] to try to control your body do the deed
[44:49] he'll make you see things that he wants
[44:55] you to see he wants to show you those
[45:00] things he showed Jesus all the kingdoms
[45:04] of the world it is you by God and why
[45:08] should be I'll give it to you oh yes
[45:12] that was a wall gone oh nothing after
[45:16] Jesus had fasted forty days and forty
[45:19] nights after a detector came to tip him
[45:24] if he tempted Jesus what about you and I
[45:29] well yes but he was no match for the
[45:34] captain of our salvation he was made
[45:38] perfect tipton at all ports not as we
[45:43] what God is evil come on victoriously
[45:51] hallelujah if he came
[45:55] then he'll come out victory and more
[45:59] than a conquerer in your life they met
[46:06] the thief comes to kill steal and
[46:09] destroy but jesus said I'll come that
[46:13] you might have a life and that you might
[46:15] have it more abundantly
[46:18] amen Jesus wants to give a life but the
[46:23] devil Satan wants to give you death amen
[46:26] but you got to make a decision what
[46:30] looks like he meant joy and pleasure now
[46:34] there's only working death out in they
[46:39] met in one day at the end of the road
[46:41] the decision that you made they Mendte
[46:46] you have to even have the final
[46:49] judgement whether your soul will be Laos
[46:54] or what are you going to be with the law
[46:57] I'm saying brother sister showdown time
[47:03] it's coming decision that you make you
[47:09] gonna be tested and try and see whether
[47:13] or not you committed
[47:15] Amen what a knot it was staying late
[47:19] have you committed of to the load and
[47:24] you've accepted him and you know that
[47:27] he's Savior and you know that he's God
[47:31] and you know that he's able he's able to
[47:37] keep back what you have committed into
[47:40] him against that day I persuaded that

[52:01] a prize that God has with him that wins
[52:06] those that will not give up those that
[52:10] would keep the fight though that would
[52:13] not turn back to the world but those
[52:18] that would say Lord I mean it all the
[52:21] way
