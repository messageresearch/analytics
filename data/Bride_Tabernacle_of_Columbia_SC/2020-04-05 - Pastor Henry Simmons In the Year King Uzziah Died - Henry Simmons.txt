Minister Palmer this morning appreciate all the ones that happen with those services and il-6 chapter in the year King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple but above it stood the seraphim's each one had six wings and between he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and between he did fly and one cried until another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i whoa is me if I'm undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the surf and to me having live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongue from the altar altar and he laid it upon my mouth and he said lo this has touched the lips and nine ickett is is taken away and our sin purged also I heard a voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me may God bless to read which words you may be seated thank the Lord amen god is good amen we taught we were just praying and reading in the Book of Isaiah and we came across this particular chapter and as I was in prayer the top it is in the year King Uzziah died and the Year King Uzziah died we realize that God's servant said the Prophet was a young prophet but he had won that he was focusing and had the utmost respect for the King Uzziah and that King had his attention sometimes we have Kings in our lives that have somewhat blinded us fought for our purpose and what God has chosen for your life and for you to do an individual so that king in our Zell's life or King Uzziah very one time a very godly King a very king that God was used sin we know at the end of the journey what happened he got leprosy and so forth but yet he was a good king sometimes they men we don't know that will being destructive we don't know sometimes what's going on because we're in the moment sometimes our eyes and our focus is not where and need to be and I believe that sometimes Uzziah have to die needs to be Amit Amit moved out of our view it happened when use iodide Isaiah said that he recognized his condition because he saw the law and he recognized how his life and it's a life condition said I'm a man of unclean lips and he knew that he dwelled in the midst of a people of unclean lips and he realized that he needed he saw a holy God and he had a glimpse of what God was it was no more Uzziah but he said I saw the Lord in the midst of the virus that has hid in the world maybe our tension our focus of me might have been on our economical situation how much money we can accumulate and how much wealth we can accumulate our attention and our focus and might have been on our body hi you know how strong we can get in how bill how we can make it beautiful and healthy maybe we've put a met other things in the Miss Sun in our view and a become more important than to us then the Lord so many things I can name but I might miss your situation maybe it's your husband maybe it's your wife maybe it's your children even it could have been a mental ability they meant to play basketball a football maybe a Sheree you had so much higher hopes South Carolina was looking for a national championship in women basketball and then sometimes God even our focus is on those things and sometimes God would change things and I believe we all apause for a moment and we ought to focus our attention in the polls and we ought to ask God amen it's going on oh did you stop everything for a moment amen that we could get refocus millions of dollars we might be able to attain but God stops everything he allows this to happen expected to happen such a thing we call the whole world to come to a halt don't know what's next wow this is going on god help me to get refocus I believe I they took the time he meant because he was a young prophet maybe his attention was on God speaking to him and dealing with him in the spiritual aspect of his life maybe he was focused more on the political side and his attention was focus on the people conditioner got bad the church was in a terrible condition God's people with the for God I believe that I shall didn't know that God was going to use him I was reading a little of Isaiah 1 and it says the eyes are warning warn the vision of Isaiah the son Emil's which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem amen in the days of Uzziah joltin ezel and Hezekiah king of Judah see Isaiah was the son of a prophet and I say himself was a prophet witches are not the usual he meant that that it happens that way he said here Oh heaven and give for the Lord has spoken I have nourished and both children and they have rebelled against me are you with me the Ox knows his owner and as his master krill but you do not know my people do not consider are you with me he said ah a sinful nation a people Lane with the nicotine a seed of evildoers children [Music] they have forsaken the Lord they have provoked the Holy One children to anger they are going away you will revoke more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart is faint from the sole of the foot even until the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrefying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither modified with augment your country is desolate you sit is a bird with fire you'll and strangers the value in your presence and it is desolate and although throwing then overthrown by strangers and the daughters of Zion is left as a cottage in the vineyard and as a large in the garden of cuckoo and as a besieged city except the Lord of hosts had left us a very small rivet we should have been as sodom and we should have been locked unto Gomorrha hear the word of the Lord ye rulers of Sodom into the law of God you people are tomorrow to what purpose is this multitude of your sacrifices than their me saith the Lord I am full of burnt offering and RAM and the fat fat beasts and I delight not in the blood of the bullets in the wrath Lambs oh the ego when he cometh to appear before me who has required this at your hand to thread my course bring no more vain ablations in sent his abomination unto me and a new moon in the Sabbath the calling of the similar I cannot away with it is iniquity even the Sodom meetings God that angry God was no longer pleased with Israel no doubt the Prophet was too busy looking at us I to understand the spiritual condition of the people nevertheless we assume that God is accepting what we're giving him we assume that God is well pleased they met with our sacrifices in our efforts too many times folks have come to church and they met because they got in the bills and they thought that God would squeeze with them so many times folks have sang on the choir and they played the music and they're preached in the pulpits and they thought that God was pleased but I believe that he said when you say of dying and so the Lord my mind is going different places and I thought that demanda people have a focus their attention on the building as the Jews in the Senate Ghani told Jesus and how beautiful the temple was G [Music] [Music] God said no more do our war dead Amen God has a stop it for a moment maybe I'll teach it and our focus is on the building and not on the root root temple of God some people believe that Amanda Jesus met a woman at the well and he acts so for drinking she cannot understand the spiritual application for the woman the Jews and the Samaritans had no dealing and she said you know fathers worshiped in this mountain say we had a son play is that we watch it in its mouth our touch man and we were a man attached to a sudden mountain a sudden holy place so you use aiya yo City God you're building that you were used to they may go on traditionally to you King no God I did not know his spiritual condition many come because religious what was required of them but it only was a custom in a tradition their heart was no longer in it see the woman said now we worship in this mountain but you say that we ought to be watching him in Jerusalem see but the woman did not know the hour that poses for normal knowing that there was the feast of Passover the face of unleavened bread and that was the face of pinnacles praise God and the face of the traffic because he drew back to homeland but there's also a feast of atonement and the feast of tabernacle are you see what happened it's a season it's a time hee hee [Music] [Music] [Music] get refocused when King Ozai died woman that our coming and now is the neither in this mountain amen I'm Italian neither in this building they meant nor any other bills neither in this mountain neither at Jerusalem but our coming to now is that the true worshipers of God I said the true worshipers see if some folk need a mint the bills into Washington some folks need a crowd to worship and he meant some folks he meant have to make a appear during the niche to go to Rome or the maker amen go to image these holy sites and once they reach there they can see the splendor of Roman and see the great amen papa and see the great gold and precious artwork over in Rome but the Pope's stood there in Rome how did nice by himself the site is there look at us this morning doesn't that's a few must come that's who how about your service it's not a holy place it's not a holy temple a build and not you got to meet Christ see they don't if I get to that mountain all be justified and if I get to that holy please the God was recognized what my salvation oh brother sauce is not what you can do that's what Christ is already done I said there is no holy place so amen to minimize he met God had to remove our alsa and let us get refocus and let us focus on Jesus there's only one place one holy place where God will meet what man God has chosen please amen that we can watch him him and that place it's Christ for he so gained a watch of me was washing me in spirit and truth you gotta come to Christ that is the Lord holy place that is the place where you can save me that is the place where you can have peace that is the place where you can have joy that is the place well you can have righteousness in the Holy Ghost in Christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body that is the please I'm saying to you what I feel like that many have not reached the place where they really understand the voice of God and God speaking to them and that's what has happened so oftentimes I believe Saul of Tarsus his Uzziah was his religion the Pharisees I believe that he was so focused on being at the top but the fire seed religion his training and any schooling had blinded him from the real true light Saul of Tarsus I if I had time I go to acts 9 but I'm not gonna go there you're familiar with the story Saul of Tarsus had letters they were that gave him authority letters that gave him Authority Amen he realized that those letters in his authority wasn't no good when it came to him persecute the Church of the Living God but if I find any of that way if they're worshiping Jesus see what I want you to understand that so Tony had it but he didn't have it I'm gonna tell you many people are so entrenched in the church - the church had blinded them folks are so dependent upon their religion for religion has blinded them folks don't even know for Paul sales of our gospel be hid it is here to them that allows and whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of the glory is the image of God they were blinded by the is blinded by the blind of the church knocking on the door the only church that put cry so now outside what you doing some folks are saying a holy man a man a bishop some folks have we have even a doctor [Music] Jesus was gone again [Music] they are taken they met the prayer to Folkestone young people don't know what it means to pray to pray to - they get a breakthrough someone you need to talk to in your house they meant why y'all find a lot to somewhere new Darden amen and talk to God and don't get up until he talks back amen and then you know even to God still speaks oh yes somehow Sid but that God spoke to him thank God baby said who will go for us I'll put you straight you gonna put you on the streetcar suite I need to go tell you what you must do Paul I want you to go down to the street called straight and you find one there by the name Ayane nice and he'll pray for you I know you're blind by the light now but here pray for you that you can receive your sight you need to repent be baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin the promises you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] the body of Christ you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't stop with justification don't stop with somebody telling you you got it you got to have it for yourself what is lacking in the church today what is it locking people that are identified with Christ in the end time what is lacking is a real personal experience with Christ I believe that Moses had his burning bush experience he saw the Lord I said God still speaks and of God haven't spoken to you and let you know your purpose we'll talk with Jesus when is the last time you talked to him and he talked back to you have you never had a personal contact with God some people don't even know his voice and it's sad so much religion so much singing is so much sacrifice it's so I was in prayer my heart was just constantly Lord it's God speaks back to me by folks ask action you know they're bored of God by the way people do things and the focus you know they hadn't been listened to God sometimes we're going to and fro and God has to stop our to and fro and since stop a hold you're going the governor governor says stay home the mayor the city say stay home they meant the guard is saying take the time to get to know me our brother Fred always says God wants you to get to know him get to know Jesus you've been too busy and God has stopped all your business and settled your down a little bit anchor your soul get what you need from God now amen why you have the space it's time to get ahold of God but the thing is how do I know so oftentimes the folks that how do I know when God is speaking to me how do I know it's verily this is how you know he said my sheep my sheep they what they know my voice are you with me and what is God voice God voices his word and where he leads me in his word I will follow you have to know Amen what God is required for you in this hour he's required you to be found in Christ who is the word and separate yourself from all unbelief get rid of all your doubts and your fears and get ahold of God with Gailey he can talk to you daily you can walk with Him amen he can live you and you can live in him are you a man it's time I for all social gatherings the social club is old ah as I use ire is dead and the social life is old ah it's time to get down to business with God we've had enough social gatherings it's time to get a hold of God if you're still social gathering in your home it's time to take the gathering to your knees it's time to sit let's have old time it price service in this house it's time for us to cry out to God does something for us where each and every individual and the family get a chance to hear from heaven what the family will have no not that the token hasn't been applied to this house and the coronavirus cannot have come here why because God is in the midst of its people Amen it's time for you not to talk about how holy you are it's time for God to speak for you and you don't speak for yourself are you up there and when your God is speaking for you you're not trying to show how super holy you are because all your righteousness is filthy rights are you
