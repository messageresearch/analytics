read the first you read the next and we'll read the next verse Lion's verse together in that day shall in that day shall this song the song in the land of Judah we have a strong City Salvation with God appoint for walls and Bullocks to thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is dead on thee because he trusted in thee for for he bringeth down them that dwell on high at the Lotus City he led It Low he led it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust six together the way of the Justice uprightness thou most upright do his way the path of the jest God bless the reasons words you may be seated he says in the eighth verse yea in the way of thou judgment O Lord have we waited for thee the desires of our soul is to thy name and to the remember to the remembrance of Thee amen your soul has a desire amen perfect peace perfect peace we just don't want just peace but perfect peace you know I thought about you know we were praying and seeking God just what way we were going in a troubled world amen in chaotic conditions and in our communities in our cities and everywhere you turn there's trouble there's something going on I was telling uh somebody uh just saying that the earthquake that hit Mexico seven point something the other week I said all it had to do was just come down a little farther and hit California in the east in the whole West Coast would have been taken out millions of people would have gone just like that it's getting closer you know and looking at peace and I was just thinking of what peace means is Freedom From War sometimes when you speak of Peace you want something to be quiet and Tranquility uh you know something that's you want to be safe it seemed like there's no place safe now but the Bible tells us the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous running thing into their safe you don't feel secured anywhere there's no security nothing is secured your your money in the bank is not secured you a 401k is not secure though your stocks and your bonds it ain't secured your job is not security you don't have security so if you're not secured then you then that's a that's a a certain amount of fear of losing man you can lose all your money you can lose your job you can lose so there's a field there that any time at any time because everything is unstable in at any time I can lose what I got right I was just looking at the battle that little sister Grace is going through right now she's probably not even 18 going through a little battle in her in her body anything can happen to any one of us at any time Anything Can Happen anytime no matter what you think about yourself and how well you think you're right my brother-in-law used to say the bishop used to say he said in your wellest day he used to say it all the time you're sick enough to die and he would always say that over and over in your Wellness day you're sick enough to die so anytime God can come by and call your number but there's a peace that no matter what comes or what goes this is what he says he says in the third verse and thou will keep him in perfect peace it's something about having peace but being kept is another thing God will keep him I want to be kept see some people have peace but the peace is not lasting sometimes we find security and sometimes we have desires that we want to fulfill and then when those these eyes are for fear amen then we sort of calm down and we kind of you know stabilize amen maybe you find the right companion maybe you find uh this or that it's things in life that causes you amen your restlessness is gone sometimes it's the right job it's the right fit and sometimes you find the trade a skill and then you kind of rest in that area of expectation the thing that you were seeking and trying to find and you find a place of contentment but your contentment does not last but he said it keeps he said thou will keep him in perfect peace you cannot hold to the peace here amen even if all of a sudden Russia and Ukraine decides that amen we're going to have a peace treaty the peace is only for season for the scripture said there shall be walls and rumors of walls the earthquakes and divers different places divers places we kind of get around the scripture it's going to happen there'll be pestilence and famines we can't get around Corona or whatever it's something that's coming because that's the way the end time is going to be and we're in the end time and amen we know that these times have come perilous time dangerous times it's death because of Peace because there's a light of trust and the one that can give you perfect peace you must have enough confidence in the one that can give you that perfect peace see he says here that thou will give him perfect peace whose mind is stead on him because he what see the reason why we're so it's so chaotic and life is so difficult amen no matter how what you're searching and what you think that you want you still don't have the peace that you desire because why because it's a lack of trust that we trust in him but if we trust him we know that he will teach that's in perfect peace the scripture that I quote all the time I was happy I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord songs or 122. usually when the church I came out of this was the what we quoted every Sunday in Psalms 122. he said I was glad I was happy when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord our feet should stand within thy gate so Jerusalem Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together brother and sisters I'm just going to talk to you a little bit this morning Jerusalem is called the city of the great king when we look at Jerusalem he he began to describe Jerusalem the Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together whether the tribes go up the tribes of the Lord to give testimony to Israel to give thanks until the name of the Lord for there are set Thrones of judgment the Thrones of the House of David he said in the sixth verse pray for the what the Peace of Jerusalem they shall what they should Prosper that love thee you know uh Solomon when he built the temple in Jerusalem he said he prayed that and we're carried away in a strange of land and yet if we look towards that Temple amen and pray amen that God would Grant Deliverance amen and then even at that when Daniel was told not to pray no more Daniel knew that he had to amen look towards that Temple and pray amen he looked toward Jerusalem and he prayed because he had a promise of God through a man a King Solomon and God came down which is Shekinah Glory and filled the temple with smoke amen and even when Jonah was in the belly of the way or or the fish he he said out yet amen he said uh amen out of the depths of hell I cried Amen in that Valley he looked toward Jerusalem they met he said man I'm gonna look towards the Holy Temple he knew that in Jerusalem was a temple of God and in Jerusalem amen that's where God was in his holy Temple amen so I'm gonna look towards Jerusalem now it was something about the city amen the city of Jerusalem amen praise God it was a city that I could go and I could rest and I can be saved amen praise God you sometimes we you know you're out somewhere and you get home and you get in your house saying to me you lock the doors and you put on an alarm or whatever you feel secure safe I know when I'm in other countries maybe in Africa or over in the Hungary or somewhere when I get home I wonder when the when the plane hits America I feel a little bit better it's all right in Africa it's all right in uh Trinidad it's all right in uh Jamaica or whatever I'm at but when I get home I feel at home brother and sister it's got to be a place that you'll feel amen I'm home now I feel amen I I I feel a little safe for amen because I can identify with this place I'm saying that it has to be a deep call into the deep to a place that I can get and I can get perfect peace I can get that security and I can find that solo solely still I can find a place that I can rest praise God I I I I can lay down and I can rest because I come to that place he said pray for the Peace of Jerusalem Nation prospered he said Peace be within our walls and prosperity within our palaces amen see it was something about the amen Jerusalem way it was built it was compact it was fortified amen and it you know and I began to say Lord you know it was at the time people wanted to be in Jerusalem because that's where the sacrifice that's where they can worship God that's where the amen the ball the blood sacrifice that's where the priests offered up to God it was something about going into I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord there's something about the house of the Lord he said when two or three are gathered in my name that I'll be in the midst there's something about coming in God's house that makes a difference for our lives it's something about God's house amen coming together amen to Jerusalem now the city uh go back to Isaiah the city amen oh that makes us glad to be in the city that makes us glad that we're in the city amen that I can feel safe and confident I can feel secured because they meant the temple of God is there amen the true worship is there amen amen they said to buy the river of Babylon there we sat down then we hanged up our heart that access the same sign song what we could not sing Zion songs in a Strange Land by the Rivers of Babylon are you with me when they were in captivity him and
