[33:20] &gt;&gt; Revelation 20.
[33:26] [Music]
[33:31] And he says,
[33:34] "And I saw an angel come down from
[33:36] heaven having the keys of the bottomless
[33:39] pit and a great chain in his hand. And
[33:43] he laid hold on the dragon, that old
[33:45] serpent, which is the devil and Satan,
[33:49] and bound him a thousand years,
[33:52] and cast him into the bottomless pit,
[33:54] and shut him up, and set a seal upon
[33:57] him, that he should deceive the nations
[33:59] no more, until the thousand years should
[34:02] be fulfilled. And after that, he must be
[34:07] loosed for a little season.
[34:10] And I saw thrones, and
[34:13] they that sat on them, and judgment was
[34:17] given unto them. And I saw the souls of
[34:21] them that were beheaded for the witness
[34:24] of Jesus and for the word of God, and
[34:28] which had not worshiped the beast,
[34:31] neither his image,
[34:33] neither had received his mark upon their
[34:36] forehead or in their hands.
[34:40] And they
[34:42] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
[34:45] years.
[34:47] But the rest of the dead live not again
[34:49] until the thousand years were finished.
[34:53] This is the first resurrection. Blessed
[34:56] and holy is he that has part in the
[34:59] first resurrection. On such the second
[35:02] death has no power, but they shall be
[35:06] priests of God and of Christ and shall
[35:11] reign with him a thousand years. God
[35:14] bless the word. You may be seated.
[35:19] Now we want to talk about the king the
[35:22] kingdom age of the time of the
[35:24] millennium the 1,000 years. Amen. The
[35:28] Bible tells us in Jude the one day is
[35:30] with the Lord is as a thousand years and
[35:32] a thousand years is as one day.
[35:35] Now we know Jesus comes in three sons.
[35:39] Son of man, son of God and son of David.
[35:43] in the son of David
[35:47] with Solomon that speaks of the
[35:50] millennium reign. And then we talked
[35:52] about the millennial r millennium reign
[35:54] the thousand years. We talk about the
[35:56] kingdom age because no doubt Pilot wrote
[36:01] over his head a accusation Jesus king of
[36:04] the Jews because
[36:07] they they looked for him. And the Jews
[36:09] were looking for a king, but yet he came
[36:13] as a servant. Amen. He came as a
[36:16] sacrifice to die on the cross, but they
[36:19] were looking and usually uh man is are
[36:23] looking for something to be in the
[36:25] future or something to be in the past.
[36:26] He always get it wrong. Amen. And that
[36:30] which God promised in his word and which
[36:32] stand before them, they can't see it.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] except God opened our eyes, you know,
[36:40] and I I I was talking to some
[36:43] individuals today and I I I talked about
[36:45] the elect because,
[36:48] you know, they they think about the the
[36:50] Muslims, the Hindus and all these people
[36:53] uh very religious, very pious. They they
[36:56] they're sincere. But what makes the
[36:59] Christian religion the the only one? I
[37:02] said God hasn't revealed that to you as
[37:04] an individual. I see even the people
[37:06] that go to church, they go to church all
[37:09] over and there's so many different ways
[37:10] of uh of Christians what they believe.
[37:13] But I said the elect and the
[37:16] predestinated. It's that we haven't
[37:18] chosen God, but God chooses us. Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And God choose chooses us. And I said
[37:24] there has to be a deep call into the
[37:28] deep. There has to be something inside
[37:30] of you that is crying out that I want to
[37:33] know truth.
[37:34] I want God. Amen. I want the true and
[37:37] living God. God, I need you.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; And God said, "My sheep will hear my
[37:42] voice." They'll know. Amen. The
[37:44] difference between all these other
[37:45] voices, all these other sounds. There
[37:48] are so many sounds or so many voices.
[37:50] Amen. But to us, it's a certain sound.
[37:53] Amen. Amen. They say that the trumpet
[37:55] gives a uncertain sound. Who going to
[37:58] prepare themselves for war? But God has
[38:00] given us a certain sound that we can
[38:02] hear. Amen. Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's something about it. You
[38:06] can you explain it to anybody? Can you
[38:08] really uh tell somebody that Amen. that
[38:11] you have faith in God and that the God
[38:14] that you serve is the true and living
[38:16] God? Can you explain that? Will they
[38:19] understand that? No. Amen. You have to
[38:22] have that revelation for yourself. Amen.
[38:24] God has to give you a visitation and
[38:26] vindicate. Amen. You Amen. Know that
[38:29] you're sons and daughters of God as
[38:31] individuals. Amen.
[38:33] That's an individual revelation. It's
[38:35] not a church. Everybody in the church
[38:37] that go to church, they that's why some
[38:40] Amen. so slack. Amen. They serve God
[38:42] like a They serve their jobs better than
[38:45] they serve God. They serve their Amen.
[38:48] different things. They're more faithful.
[38:50] Amen. To the worldly things than they
[38:52] are to God. Amen. But those that are
[38:55] chosen, Amen, before the foundation of
[38:57] the world know what their calling is.
[38:59] that you're here to represent Jesus
[39:02] Christ. Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God, it's all it's a
[39:10] it's your walk with God. What God has
[39:12] revealed to you. You cannot walk in no
[39:15] more than God has revealed to you.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:20] Now when I talk about the kingdom age,
[39:23] the question
[39:25] was to to Jesus in Acts one,
[39:30] Acts 1 and3.
[39:32] It it's talking about
[39:35] these former trios
[39:38] treaties have I made. O Theophus
[39:42] of all that Jesus began to both to teach
[39:45] until the day which he was taken up
[39:47] after that he through the Holy Ghost had
[39:51] given commandments unto his apostles
[39:53] whom he had chosen. to whom also he
[39:56] showed himself alive after his passion
[40:01] by many infallible proofs.
[40:05] God will show you by many infallible
[40:08] proofs. Amen. You'll walk with him. Keep
[40:11] walking with him. And God will prove
[40:13] himself to you by many infallible
[40:16] proofs.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll continue to open and unveil
[40:21] his self to you. Amen. that you'll know
[40:24] that you're in the right path. That
[40:26] you'll know that you're chosen, that
[40:28] you're a peculiar people, that you're a
[40:31] royal priesthood, that you're a holy
[40:33] nation, that you are the lights of the
[40:35] world. God will prove and vindicate that
[40:38] to you as you keep walking. He'll show
[40:41] himself alive by many infallible proofs.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; He'll prove it.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. There'll be no doubt in your mind.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; You're not just walking because Amen.
[40:52] The somebody preached something to you.
[40:54] Somebody said something. God has
[40:56] revealed himself to you.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; He's made himself known to you.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. What could make Moses give
[41:02] up everything that he had to follow?
[41:05] Amen. Those that were in bondage and
[41:07] slavery. What could make him identify
[41:09] with them? God. Amen. He had met their
[41:11] God who is invisible.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; He was wear
[41:16] willing to give up my all. But when
[41:19] people are holding on to this word, it's
[41:20] because they're blind.
[41:22] Amen. Praise God. They're blind. The
[41:24] devil got them blind. He said, "If our
[41:27] gospel be hid is hid to them that are
[41:29] lost, whom the God of this world has
[41:31] blinded the mind of them that believe
[41:33] not, least the light of the gospel who
[41:36] is the image of God should shine unto
[41:38] them."
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God hadn't sh if the light
[41:43] hadn't shine, I I I can't make the light
[41:47] shine for you. It's God. Amen. But
[41:49] that's got to be something in you. So
[41:51] God, let your light shine.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Make yourself known unto me.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:58] Lord,
[41:59] &gt;&gt; some kind of way. Amen. You desire
[42:03] truth. You desired. Amen. God to make
[42:06] himself known to you as an individual.
[42:08] But others, they just
[42:11] God want me to be saved. If God want me
[42:13] to know, and they come to church
[42:15] faithful. They might pay the tithe. They
[42:17] might sing. They might do things, but
[42:19] they don't want to know God.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in them that want to
[42:23] know God in an intimate way, in a real
[42:25] way. Nothing. Amen. They want to know
[42:28] him, but they just Amen.
[42:31] We talking about the kitchen and we
[42:33] talking about the living room, but they
[42:35] know me in intimate way in a close walk.
[42:38] They're going on from the imaticost and
[42:41] intercourse into the inner veil, going
[42:43] into the holy holiness.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. those that want to know him.
[42:48] That's right.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Want to know him in the power of his
[42:50] resurrection. Son, a lot of folks that
[42:52] go for the holling and the screaming and
[42:54] the intellectualism. But Amen.
[42:57] intellectualism don't bring forth a
[42:59] child.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might know all about how to do
[43:03] it. But you got to have that intimate
[43:06] relationship with God.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:14] So in the he says
[43:18] showed himself alive
[43:21] by many infallible proofs being seen of
[43:25] them 40 days after Jesus rose from the
[43:29] dead. He showed himself alive 40 days.
[43:32] Amen.
[43:36] And speaking
[43:38] of the things
[43:40] pertaining to the what?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Kingdom of God.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're talking about the kingdom of
[43:46] God. When we speak of kingdom, we must
[43:48] have a king in a kingdom. Amen.
[43:52] So uh
[43:56] and when they talked about Jesus as son
[43:59] of man, son of God, then son of David.
[44:03] Son of David has references to Amen.
[44:06] Solomon was the son of David. And it has
[44:09] references to Solomon rule. David fought
[44:12] a lot of wars. Amen. And he could not
[44:15] build God house. But Solomon, amen, was
[44:19] the son that came in and there was a
[44:21] peaceful reign. And he and Jesus was
[44:24] called the son of David, the son of
[44:26] peace. Amen. So Jesus, Amen, in the
[44:30] millennium reign, there would be Oh,
[44:32] I'll get to that in a minute. But he
[44:35] says,
[44:36] "And being a a assembler together with
[44:42] them, commanded them that they should
[44:44] not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for
[44:48] the promise of the Father, which he
[44:50] says, he
[44:54] &gt;&gt; says he,
[45:00] the promise of the Father, which
[45:04] Yeah, that's says he
[45:08] says he ye shall
[45:12] &gt;&gt; you've heard of me
[45:16] &gt;&gt; says he okay
[45:22] I was saying that with but it was coming
[45:24] out in something else saying it in my
[45:27] head
[45:29] for John truly baptized with water But
[45:33] ye shall be baptized with the what?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Not many days hence. Amen.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; When
[45:43] they were therefore
[45:47] come together, they asked of him,
[45:49] saying, Lord, will thou at this time
[45:53] restore what?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; See, they knew they knew what was
[45:59] promised. They knew that the kingdom age
[46:02] would come, that God would come and he
[46:05] would rule as king on the earth. And
[46:09] they were looking forward to him to be
[46:11] king. But what a disappointment.
[46:15] I believe that many people go to church
[46:17] and they what they're looking for,
[46:18] they're disappointed with it.
[46:21] They come to church and they're looking
[46:23] for Amen. They're looking for God to be
[46:26] real and and the power of God, but they
[46:29] come to church. Amen. And and it's all
[46:32] kind of chaos in the church.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; All kind of confusion. Amen. And they
[46:36] don't even see God.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] So sometimes folks give up. They just
[46:44] give up because they don't see what
[46:45] they're looking. Amen. What it says.
[46:47] Amen. They don't see it as a reality for
[46:50] them. But God reveals himself in
[46:52] simplicity.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; God is still God.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; God is still moving.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; God is still fulfilling his word.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; And doing what he said he'll do.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may not see it, but somebody
[47:07] Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody chosen to see.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He showed himself to them because
[47:13] they were chosen to see. Amen.
[47:18] Thank God. Amen. I believe you're here.
[47:21] Amen. Because you God chose you to see.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; But even in them seeing and him
[47:28] revealing things to them, but they said,
[47:31] "Master, will thou at this time restore
[47:33] the kingdom to Israel?" Because they
[47:36] had, Amen.
[47:39] They knew, Amen. that the kingdom
[47:43] they came preaching, repent for the
[47:45] kingdom of heaven is at hand. Isn't that
[47:48] right?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But and they knew, Amen. believed
[47:52] that he was that king.
[47:55] So, but the time
[47:58] the time that God was going to restore
[48:01] the kingdom. Amen. They were looking and
[48:04] anticipating it right then.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. How this mighty God, this mighty
[48:11] God done come, Amen. down and died.
[48:16] Amen. And then he rose.
[48:19] Amen.
[48:21] He rose again.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, can they can they look at that?
[48:26] Amen. A resurrected Jesus.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You It took power.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; To get up out the grave.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And to walk around again.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; And they told them that no man take my
[48:41] life. I lay it down. Got power to take
[48:43] it up again.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Now they see this
[48:47] mighty God being unveiled before them.
[48:51] They seeing God, amen, in the midst.
[48:54] Amen. And when they see us mighty God,
[48:57] they ask the question, "Will thou at
[49:00] this time restore the kingdom to
[49:03] Israel?"
[49:04] Amen.
[49:07] You know, no doubt they ate with him.
[49:09] They fellowship with him. And Amen.
[49:13] Thomas done put his hand in the nail
[49:14] print all of that.
[49:17] He sat down with them and taught him for
[49:20] 40 days.
[49:24] Now they want the kingdom. Now they're
[49:27] ready. They're ready for the king
[49:31] to take over.
[49:34] It's our turn now. So many times people
[49:37] are anxious.
[49:39] They're excited
[49:42] knowing that the God what God had
[49:44] promised what he promised to do.
[49:47] Praise God. What he said he'll do
[49:51] and then wanted to know is this the
[49:53] time?
[49:55] I was just going back over the message,
[49:57] sir. Is this the time at the end?
[50:00] Amen. The prophet didn't know. He said,
[50:03] "It might be my life, might be this,
[50:05] might be that." But he said, "Is this
[50:06] the time?"
[50:08] He said, "I believe that this is the
[50:10] time with all these things that
[50:13] happened. I believe that the coming of
[50:15] the Lord is right around the corner."
[50:17] How many times we have anticipated the
[50:19] coming of the Lord to take place and it
[50:22] didn't take place.
[50:24] Amen. But uh folks are excited. But I I
[50:28] I I'm talking about a promise of a
[50:30] kingdom age. I'm talking about God. It
[50:33] told them that let not your heart be
[50:34] troubled. You believe in God, believe
[50:36] also in me and my father's. house of
[50:38] many mansions. I'm going away to prepare
[50:41] a place for you. They were looking
[50:43] forward to that. And you and I, Amen.
[50:47] You know, we don't want this world
[50:50] because the world, this is not our, this
[50:52] is not our home. This cosmos, this world
[50:55] order, this this what we see. Amen. With
[50:58] our five senses. I was talking to
[51:00] Josiah. I was talking about these five
[51:02] senses. This is not ours. Amen. the the
[51:05] the kingdom that God gave you and I at
[51:07] this particular season, this particular
[51:09] time, amen, was not a meat and drink,
[51:12] but righteousness, peace, and joy in the
[51:15] Holy Ghost.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; But there was going to be a physical
[51:18] kingdom that God was going to manifest
[51:21] himself and give them a kingdom age and
[51:24] a millennia age where Jesus Christ would
[51:26] be son of David and sit on the throne.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're going to live and reign
[51:34] with him a what? Thousand years.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; A thousand years.
[51:39] Okay. So, but look,
[51:43] if you don't believe it, you go do
[51:45] anything you want to do. That's right.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; You do. You just live it up. Drink,
[51:50] smoke, lie, steal, cheat. If you don't
[51:53] believe it, just do what you want. But
[51:56] to them that believe,
[51:58] &gt;&gt; yes, Jesus.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. They know this life here is just
[52:02] just short.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; We're only here but a few moments.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; It's like a flower. It's like grass.
[52:09] It's gone. But if you believe in the
[52:12] promise of God, Amen. I mean, it was 2
[52:15] million believed in the promise of God,
[52:18] but only two made it.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And I'm saying, Amen.
[52:24] You as an individual must believe that
[52:26] God promised you eternal life. And God
[52:30] promised you a millennium reign.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Now he says here
[52:43] not just the marriage supper. He said
[52:49] in Jesus in the seventh verse he says
[52:51] unto them it is not for you to what?
[52:56] It's not for you to know the time or nor
[52:59] the what
[53:01] &gt;&gt; which the father has put in his what?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; In his own power. But look at he says he
[53:09] continued but
[53:12] but ye shall receive power.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; It's in his power but ye shall receive
[53:18] power.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants you to anticipate that
[53:22] no man knows. Amen.
[53:25] only. Amen. Praise God. It's put in his
[53:30] own power. But you going to get power.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power that workketh in you
[53:36] ought to be speaking to your inner man
[53:39] saying something to you.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; The power, Amen, that God gives you
[53:44] ought to give you resurrection
[53:46] attention.

[53:54] for what God promised he's going to
[53:56] perform.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to wait on it.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know God is able
[54:04] &gt;&gt; for these dry bones to live.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; The bones going to come together.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; They might say all hope is lost.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; But it's not lost.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I know God lives.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[54:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; So he says, "But ye shall receive power
[54:33] &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost has come upon you,
[54:36] and you shall be witnesses of me both in
[54:38] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[54:41] Samaritan and in the utmost parts of the
[54:43] earth." The church getting ready to take
[54:46] off.

[54:53] know it." Amen. But it's in the power,
[54:57] his own power. And you got the power and
[55:01] God can make himself known.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God is ready, he can release
[55:06] it into you.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The resurrection power.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And that resurrection power made you fa
[55:14] get so close to him.

[1:01:13] can live his life through you.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; He know you're a failure.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; He know you can't do it.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; But he can do it if you just let him.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; If you allow him to do it, he'll do it
[1:01:26] for you.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. Yes, Lord.

[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Just allow God to work
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; his work
[1:01:51] 65 and 15.
[1:01:56] Del,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; and ye shall leave your name for a curse
[1:01:59] unto my chosen. For the Lord God shall
[1:02:02] slay thee, and call his servants by
[1:02:04] another name, that he who blesses
[1:02:07] himself in the earth shall bless himself
[1:02:10] in the God of truth. And he that swearth
[1:02:12] in the earth shall swear by the God of
[1:02:15] truth. Because the former troubles are
[1:02:17] forgotten, and because they are hid from
[1:02:20] mine eyes. For behold, I create new
[1:02:22] heaven and a new earth, and the former
[1:02:25] shall not be remembered.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Any man being in Christ is a new
[1:02:29] creature.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away. Behold, all
[1:02:32] things become what?
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; God want to create a new you.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; As he wants to create a new heaven and a
[1:02:40] new earth, God wants to create recreate
[1:02:42] you in Christ.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. Go ahead.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, come into mind. But be ye glad and
[1:02:49] rejoice forever in that which I create.
[1:02:52] For behold, I create Jerusalem a
[1:02:55] rejoicing and her people a joy. And
[1:02:58] that's what God said. I do it. Not you.
[1:03:01] I do it.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And her people are joy.

[1:03:07] the kingdom of God. Amen. That's peace,
[1:03:10] righteousness, peace, and joy in the
[1:03:12] Holy Ghost. I create this. Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. And I will rejoice in
[1:03:17] Jerusalem and joy in my people. And the
[1:03:21] voice of weeping shall be no more heard
[1:03:23] in heard, nor the voice of crying.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And you compare that with Revelation 21.
[1:03:29] Amen.
[1:03:31] God's going to take away all the
[1:03:33] weeping. Amen. Your sorrows, your
[1:03:36] weeping, your crying. He said, "I saw
[1:03:39] new Jerusalem come down from God out of
[1:03:41] heaven, prepared as a bride adorn for
[1:03:43] her husband." Ain't that right?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is going to bring that new
[1:03:47] Jerusalem. Amen. But God gonna clean up
[1:03:49] this and going to have a millennium
[1:03:50] reign. After millennia reign, Satan
[1:03:52] gonna be loose for a little season.
[1:03:54] After that little season, it going to be
[1:03:56] judgment and throw it in the bottom lake
[1:03:58] of fire. Amen. And then God Amen. John
[1:04:02] said, "I saw a new heaven and new earth
[1:04:04] come down from God out of heaven." Are
[1:04:06] you with me?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Y'all with me?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going too fast. Okay, go ahead on.
[1:04:13] Keep reading. And there shall be no more
[1:04:15] than an infant of days, nor an old man
[1:04:18] that hath not filled his days. For the
[1:04:21] child shall die 100 years old, but the
[1:04:24] sinner of being 100 years old.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; The question was asked to the prophet,
[1:04:27] how can a child die 100 years old? He
[1:04:29] said in the millennium reign.
[1:04:32] And he said, would there be death there?
[1:04:35] He could he couldn't. He said, you don't
[1:04:37] know.
[1:04:40] But you got people that know everything,
[1:04:42] don't you?
[1:04:44] He said that he didn't know. Amen. And
[1:04:46] that's what I used to wonder. Why our
[1:04:48] child going to die? I said, "Is there
[1:04:49] going to be people left over after after
[1:04:52] the
[1:04:53] the f this this nuclear bomb in the
[1:04:56] great tribulation period?" Because he
[1:04:58] said the nation is going to bring their
[1:05:03] go ahead on read.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And they shall build houses and inhabit
[1:05:08] them and they shall plant vineyards and
[1:05:10] eat the fruit of them. They shall not
[1:05:12] build in another inhabit. They shall not
[1:05:15] plant and another eat. For as the days
[1:05:18] of a tree are the days of my people, and
[1:05:21] mine elect shall long enjoy the works of
[1:05:24] their hands. They shall not labor in
[1:05:26] vain, nor bring forth for trouble, for
[1:05:29] they are the seed of the blessed of the
[1:05:31] Lord, and their offspring with them. And
[1:05:34] it shall come to pass that before they
[1:05:36] call, I will answer. And while they are
[1:05:39] yet speaking, I will.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; You know, if you don't, I mean, if you
[1:05:44] take God at his word and believe his
[1:05:46] word, then all your troubles, a lot of
