God bless you brother and sisters good to be in the house of the Lord as we stand for the word amen oh Hall I'm just going to go straight into the word I thank God again I can depend on God lately we were dealing with looking into the Unseen because the temporal things he said the things that are seen are temporary yes Lord but the things that are not seen are [Music] Eternal and and I I was meditating last night and it says expect unexpected expect the unexpected amen but this morning we want to talk to you about all things are possible so I just read read one verse and perhaps going to the topic this morning and again I thank God for all the ministers if we have ministers in the family or Ministers of the Gospel appreciate you you can stand at this time and want to recognize you thank God for all the ministers God bless you thank God for you appreciate your coming amen um Mark 9 and I'm going to go at the 23rd verse and um just alleviate the reading if you want to stand for that verse for the reading of the scripture that'll be fine it says Jesus said unto him if thou can believe all things are what to him that God bless the word you may be seated this father came to Jesus and his son was ill and deaf and dumb and Spirits had him bound thank you you Jesus and he said that Jesus I've taken them to your disciples and they couldn't happen and uh if you will have compassion if you can do anything if you can help him then I want you to help him and Jesus said in the here if thou can believe then all things are possible I think that not only did he said then but he said to you and I now if you can believe then all things are possible if you can believe no doubt the man had tried not only the disciples uh but he decide you know when we go to the doctor and we go to different places to try to get help when all help has failed the woman with the issue blood she went everywhere but she finally came to Jesus sometimes we come to Jesus is our last resour and then he wasn't sure he said if you can and Jesus required if you can believe when all fails to take the help you when everybody else fail and everything else fail goe amen why don't you take it to Jesus because he will never failure amen praise God the medicine might not work the doctor may not work the pastor may not be able but why don't you take it to Jesus amen why don't you let Jesus have it if thou can believe then all things are possible problem is that folks have trouble with trusting God the song says Lord we can depend on him we have trouble they bought it was about 5,000 gathered and they all gathered around and after they heard the message Jesus they were going to send them away and Jesus said don't send them away like they us because they would faint on the way that's right let give them something to eat before they go and the disciples went to look for something to feed uh this 5,000 folk and when they went to look they only found two fish and five loads of bread they came back and said Jesus all we could find there's two fish and five loaves of bread Jesus said set the people in companies 500 at a time and let them sat down for the meal we without our caral mind and thinking what in the world is he doing what is huh you got two fishes and you got 5,000 men and women besides children and you say set him down see what's impossible Shake somebody hand tell them the impossible impossible is possible with God With God all I said all things are possible when they sat down and they ate and when they were finished they remain 12 B said it didn't say just basted full that's right now it started with two two fish two loaves two fish and Five Loaves are you with me but the ended off with more than enough amen if you put it in Jesus hand he can multiply if you let him have amen amen amen praise God you're little amen all right he can make it much am but you got to be able to trust him Hallelujah can you see the disciples and the folk what in the world what is he trying to do this isn't possible can he do it oh yes I don't know what situation or problems of what you're going through right now but can he hand it somebody said I'm going through marriage of difficulties somebody said I tried the doctors and seem like my sickness still is there somebody's going going through depression in their mind and they said now the medicine uh uh uh that's trying to relax my nerves it ain't working take a little drinking but that ain't working smoke a little joint they said it ought to fix it but that ain't working now what am I going to do somebody said I can't live like I'm living because I can't take the pain I can't deal with what I'm going through right now and sometimes we try to fix it on our own and we look to all types of Remedies but we fail to take it to Jesus and Let Jesus fix it for us now I want to talk about another story in the Bible but I have some testimonies that I can talk about are you with me I can talk about amen when cancer had spread all over individuals bodies uhuh amen and the doctors say it's over wet praise God sometime you got to refuse when they trying to convince you that is all over that is no hope sometimes you got to take a stand and said Lord am amen I believe that with you amen all things are possible the doctor said no way I've seen the nurses and doctors said No Way Pastor you you you you don't know what you're talking about Ain no way I said I trust God I said I believe God amen now I don't care how long they've been in a coma I don't care if the the cancer is sprouted all over the body that's right it may look impossible to you but With God all things are possible it's not a a a story of history whyde back y but I'm talking about God right now he's the same God yesterday and today and forever he's the same God he's still working miracles hey anybody need a miracle everybody believe he's still the same God if he did it for them he'll do it for you praise God if th can believe then you believe it yes praise God just think about it think about a need in your life think about what you've been going through or maybe one of your loved ones are going through this morning could I be in a place where my faith can reach heaven Hallelujah hallelu Jesus can I trust God for something this morning can I believe that God is [Music] able hallelujah hallelujah praise God you can't make me doubt it I know too much about it you can't make me doubt him in my heart praise God Amen I know what it can do I know what he's already done praise God hallelujah somebody said he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask or think he's able I said he's able my God is able Lord oh yes more than able he can do itus Hallelujah with God I said with God not some but all things are possible [Applause] now we look at Sarah and aam yes sir and God coming down to visit them and they sitting at the tent and God says to Abraham Sarah thy wife is going to have a child his visitation to uh Abraham and Sarah was just before Sodom burnt just before God burnt Sodom he came down and said shall I hide from Abraham the thing I'm about to do that's right and the Bible tells me as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom said thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed are you with me why do we have to come back to Sodom why does the world have to get in the condition of no before Jesus could come the conditions had to be right go before judgment strike amen sin has to come to its peak we're at the end now where everything is been accepted and people want us to accept sin as being the normal that's right and wrong as being right but we come to a place that it's going to be somebody that's going to take a stand for God and said the word of God is right it doesn't matter who don't believe it it's still right I'm going to stand on the Promises of God but just before the body change just before the Rapture take place Sarah and Abraham was getting ready to have a visitation of a body change uhhuh that's right see they were old and the Bible tells us in Romans Abraham was about 100 years old are you with me and being about a 100 years old he considered not his own body that's right as though it was dead and it dried up neither the dadness of Sarah's WB but instead of getting weak in faith the Bible said Abraham was strong in faith amen when we ought to be giving up when we ought to be shaking our head and said no way no how amen hallelujah am with God yes it is I said yes it [Applause] is Sarah in the tent behind she laugh and the angel said why did Sarah laugh shall I have pleasure with my Lord when I'm so old and wrinkled up and death but God said you going to have that son sir are you with me praise God it's impossible tell somebody Again The Impossible possible is possible is possible are you with me it's impossible for man but it's possible with God Amen man can't see what your faith is saying amen Faith looks at the Unseen amen asides that it is I count those things that be not as though they are yes they are amen yes perhaps he said I don't know how you're going to do it but I believe I believe your word I don't know how it's going to be done but if God said it I I believe it if he said it then he can do it and I know he will because he said he [Applause] will thank you Jes amen so here they receiving a body change it wasn't long after they take a journey and the King Abraham said to Sarah I want you to tell them that you my sister now as she was not years old and rankled up and dead but she had received her body chains right are you with me yeah she was no more old and rankle but she become a young girl young lady again uhhuh are you with me and he told now tell that king and the king and God said do the king don't you touch that woman that c as a man's wife amen ain't that right yeah and he said he he told me she told me it was a sister I just kind into he said let let him pray for you are you with me yes so what happened a body changed right in the scripture and we've been reading it all our lives and didn't know that there was a body change right in the word if he can do it for them did what about the Lord coming amen with a shout the voice of an archangel amen what about the rapture we shall be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye a't that right for that's corruptable amen it might seem impossible amen but that's corruptable much put on in corruption it takes Faith to believe that but somebody believe Lord if you can can you help him if you can help my son help him Lord he said if you believe praise God if you believe amen then the sickness that's in your body Lord amen then your high blood pressure sugar diabetes whatever you're going through if you can believe praise God can he deliver off of dialysis can he deliver amen can the crapper still walk can the blind still see can the death still hear can God [Applause] CH amen somebody said show me a miracle and I'll believe I had a Bible study with a bunch of professors some from Clemson doctors and everything and one of the professors he had theology degree and he become agnostic and they got those big words and you know he didn't believe no more
