[20:24] Christ amen
[20:26] god is good a man we want to look at the
[20:30] Book of Luke by God's grace
[20:45] Luke 19 and we'll begin at the between
[20:53] eight verse
[21:01] Luke 1928 and it reads and when he had
[21:05] thus spoken he went before ascending up
[21:08] to Jerusalem and he came to pass when he
[21:11] was come nigh to - Beth - Beth page Beth
[21:15] words and Bethany at the Mount called
[21:18] the Mount of Olives he sent two of his
[21:22] disciples saying go ye into the village
[21:25] over against you in the which at your
[21:28] entering you should find a Colt tied
[21:29] whereon yet never man set it loose him
[21:33] and bring him hit hitter and if any man
[21:37] shall ask you why do you lose him that's
[21:39] how you say unto Him because the LORD
[21:40] hath need of him and they went and they
[21:43] that were sent went their way and they
[21:46] found even as he had said unto them and
[21:48] as they were loosing the Colt owners
[21:49] thereof said unto them why I lose ye the
[21:52] coat and they said the Lord hath need of
[21:54] him and they brought him unto Jesus and
[21:58] they cast their garments upon the cotan
[22:00] is set and they set Jesus thereon and
[22:03] he's with and as he went they spread
[22:07] their clothes in a way and when he was
[22:10] come now even now at the descent of the
[22:13] Mount of Olives the whole multitude of
[22:15] disciples began to rejoice and praise
[22:17] God with the loud voice for all the
[22:19] mighty works that they had seen saying
[22:22] blessed be the king that cometh in the
[22:25] name of the Lord
[22:26] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[22:28] some of the rarest Pharisees from among
[22:30] the multitude said unto Him master
[22:32] rebuked our disciples and he said he
[22:35] answered and said to them I tell you
[22:37] that if these should hold their peace
[22:38] the stones would immediately cry out and
[22:41] when he was come near he beheld a city
[22:44] and wept over it saying if thou has
[22:47] known even thou at least in this day
[22:51] that day the things which belongeth unto
[22:53] that peace but now they are hid from
[22:56] Dianna's for the days shall come upon
[22:59] thee that nine enemies shall cast a
[23:01] trench about thee and compacity round
[23:04] and keep being in on every side and
[23:07] shall lay thee
[23:09] even with the ground and our children
[23:12] within thee they shall not leave be one
[23:15] stone upon another because thou knowest
[23:18] not the time of that visitation and he
[23:22] went into the temple and began to cast
[23:23] him out and sold therein and them that
[23:26] that ball saying unto the I mean is
[23:29] written my house is the house of prayer
[23:31] but yea meeting in a den of thieves and
[23:34] he talked daily in the temple but the
[23:36] priests did she priests and the scribes
[23:39] and a cheap people saw the chief other
[23:42] peoples sought to destroy him and could
[23:45] not find what they might do for all the
[23:47] people were very attentive to hear them
[23:51] may God to hear him may God had blessed
[23:53] her reading of his word you may be
[23:54] seated
[23:55] standing tonight by God's grace I just
[23:59] want to minister for a moment and I
[24:02] entitled it the days shall come the days
[24:06] shall come speaking here of Jesus and
[24:10] how he says here in the 43rd verse he
[24:14] says for the days shall come upon thee
[24:16] that dying enemies shall cast a trench
[24:19] about thee and compacity round about and
[24:21] keep being on every side and so you know
[24:24] we're seeing that the setting here of
[24:27] Jesus entering Jerusalem you know I say
[24:31] that he was in Jerusalem under a triumph
[24:33] under shouts of praise and you know the
[24:36] people crying out onto Hosanna
[24:39] you know blessed is he that coming to
[24:41] the name of the Lord that crying out
[24:42] unto Him and you know the reason why the
[24:45] shouts in the cries and appraises
[24:48] because of you know the Bible says that
[24:50] they were I guess we were paraphrasing
[24:52] just excited and stirred because of all
[24:55] the many wonderful works and the mighty
[24:57] things they had already seen out of
[24:59] Jesus and now here here he is coming to
[25:01] Jerusalem you know seem to be on the
[25:03] triumph but it was something you know
[25:07] that that Jesus he knew that you know
[25:10] that the world I would say he came to
[25:14] his own his own received or not so even
[25:16] though it seems that he was coming and
[25:18] triumph he knew that you know he would
[25:21] be standing there one day
[25:22] as a rejected team among them and the
[25:25] Bible says that he cried as he came and
[25:27] he wept over the city and he begins to
[25:31] say unto them you know the days is
[25:34] coming and he began to talk to him you
[25:38] know look at Matthew I believe it is 28
[25:39] and he began to weeping over the city
[25:41] and talk about how he said God he said
[25:44] how God desired to gather you up under
[25:47] his wings as a hen doesn't chick he says
[25:49] but every every prophet in and great
[25:53] mighty thing that God sent in among you
[25:54] you rejected it you stoned you cast down
[25:57] but he says here he says the day is
[26:00] gonna come when your enemy is gonna go
[26:02] on camp about you when your enemy's just
[26:05] paraphrasing it would be so so Mario
[26:07] upon you and they would you know destroy
[26:11] you he said and at all it's gonna all be
[26:13] because he says that you didn't know
[26:17] your day of visitation
[26:18] you missed your hour your time you
[26:21] missed that you mister you might have
[26:23] been caught up in the mighty works and
[26:25] the signs and the wonders and and the
[26:27] things but you missed the very
[26:29] importance of what was among you but the
[26:32] Bible says that you know that that here
[26:35] he was saying he was saying in a 240
[26:38] second verse if thou has known even
[26:40] though at least in that day the things
[26:42] which belonging to that peace but now
[26:44] they are hid from that ass see we know
[26:48] that just knowing about a scripture that
[26:49] the Bible talked about the Jews being
[26:52] blinded but God still had a remnant and
[26:55] the rest they were blinded you know so
[26:57] he says that you know they were blinded
[27:00] from those things but if you only had
[27:01] known you know what hour you were living
[27:04] in if you would only have known he said
[27:07] in this die day that was belonging to
[27:09] your piece if you only had known you
[27:12] know who was among then you know it
[27:15] could have been such more of a glorious
[27:19] or triumphant a time for you but you
[27:23] were blinded so the days we want to
[27:25] tonight by God's grace we want to dwell
[27:27] on he said the day you shall come you
[27:30] know I was thinking about that the other
[27:32] day and I was like you know how blessed
[27:34] it is
[27:35] we always talked about how we can come
[27:38] together how we could fellowship how we
[27:41] could come to the altar how we can have
[27:42] the prayer meetings how we could you
[27:45] know uh just enjoy the blessings and the
[27:48] things of God because of his spirit you
[27:51] know just being so fresh among you but
[27:53] it just came in my spirit the days will
[27:55] come where those times will be just a
[27:57] memory the days will come where you wish
[28:00] that you can make it to the house of God
[28:02] but you can't make it the days or come
[28:04] where you wish that you you can have the
[28:07] blessings of being able to fellowship
[28:10] together and or or to be able to get
[28:12] down on your knees and get a
[28:14] breakthrough but as he said to them you
[28:16] bit they missed a day of visitation they
[28:19] missed their hour they didn't realize
[28:22] what time and what day they were living
[28:24] in so they missed it but he said the
[28:26] days are coming you know I was thinking
[28:28] about I said I said what it is I said a
[28:31] little saying that they got it says you
[28:33] don't miss your water until your rail
[28:35] runs dry you won't know how important
[28:38] just that drink of water was until you
[28:41] don't have it no more and then you
[28:43] realize just importance I could say that
[28:46] it was a of how important things was
[28:50] were in your life or just what things
[28:52] meant to you until they be taken away
[28:54] and we find that I said you know in
[28:58] natural in in natural things you know in
[29:01] life you know we look at who says a wise
[29:03] man you know he'll try to he'll try to
[29:06] plan we say for the things of head for
[29:09] the things ahead because you know he
[29:12] knows especially if he live long enough
[29:13] he know that things change he know that
[29:17] people change he know that you have
[29:19] times and seasons and things thing
[29:22] always be the way that they are so what
[29:25] he tries to do is try to seize the
[29:27] moment an opportunity at a time that's
[29:30] right there before him that's what a
[29:31] wise men to do because he knows just
[29:34] like we says I was looking at I says you
[29:37] know that he said we saying all the time
[29:39] say that trouble don't last always but
[29:42] we know that even just as trouble don't
[29:44] last always those seasons of blessings
[29:47] to be cut out to it comes
[29:49] time you know when God is just out
[29:51] pouring his blessings and it's so rich
[29:53] but in those times when the blessings
[29:56] are being outpouring you know I beseech
[29:58] you by the mercies of the Living God to
[30:00] take full opportunity of those blessings
[30:03] I was thinking about I said God gives
[30:05] his people a way of escape we say
[30:09] sometimes a period of grace a chance to
[30:11] repent they get their soul right come on
[30:14] God said I come to visit you this day
[30:16] don't miss your hour don't miss your
[30:19] time don't miss that window or when the
[30:21] Holy Ghost is out pouring fresh come on
[30:24] when the time comes and God is yeah I
[30:27] says you know I you have to learn you
[30:30] know even within yo your Christian
[30:32] journey that windows when those times
[30:34] come when those blessings are falling
[30:37] sometimes you got to store up when the
[30:39] windows of heaven are open because when
[30:40] the windows are shut sometimes you might
[30:42] think oh I just got a touch oh that was
[30:44] enough but no I believe David didn't
[30:47] just want his cup just to be filled but
[30:49] he said I want my cup to run over come
[30:51] on when the windows of heaven are open I
[30:54] don't want just a little bit but I want
[30:55] more than enough I want enough that's
[30:58] once that I know that's gonna sustain me
[31:00] throughout the night because I believe
[31:02] that if that you know that the days are
[31:04] come where people are desire you know
[31:07] sometimes you know the word just
[31:10] becoming fresh just it's messy for the
[31:12] ministry the word come fresh to work God
[31:15] is just or the Spirit is just falling
[31:17] fresh your eyes is just beginning to
[31:19] open the things and you learn to cherish
[31:21] those times you learn to dig in those
[31:23] words you learn that it ain't always you
[31:26] can get down on your knees and pray but
[31:28] it's those seasons those cycles well you
[31:30] can get down on your knees and get that
[31:32] breakthrough
[31:33] it ain't seem like it ain't hard get
[31:36] down on your knees and all of a sudden
[31:37] the Spirit of God come down but that's
[31:39] in those times you want to store up you
[31:41] want to pray all that you can pray you
[31:43] want to get it all in you come on
[31:45] because the time will come when those
[31:47] when those windows will be shut we look
[31:49] at it like that those doors will be shut
[31:51] and you can't get that breakthrough but
[31:53] if you store it up you got enough to
[31:55] last you through that drought you got
[31:57] enough to last you through that cycle
[31:59] and that season come on when everybody
[32:02] else
[32:02] since it is going through heaven burden
[32:05] don't know whether they're gonna got
[32:06] enough to make it to tomorrow but you
[32:08] got enough when God has encouraged you
[32:11] that you know you got enough that's
[32:12] gonna last you got something that's
[32:15] gonna keep you it's gonna hold out why
[32:17] because when those times you stored up I
[32:20] was praying and I just something is
[32:22] ringing out in my my spirit he was
[32:24] saying store up come on
[32:26] store home get all you can right now
[32:28] cause the time the days might come come
[32:32] on with me and can't call on my name is
[32:34] they ought to as they desire they can't
[32:36] call them unnies and store up come on
[32:39] because the times ahead so we saw that
[32:42] and I says that you know it's something
[32:45] how Jesus you know like we said in turn
[32:47] on the triumph and even though they were
[32:50] glad to see them because of the mighty
[32:51] wonders and miracles Jesus wept over the
[32:54] city
[32:54] he said because they don't understand
[32:56] what's taking place among go they missed
[32:59] the hour they missed a day of visitation
[33:01] and I said it's something about when you
[33:04] miss out on God in the doors shut you
[33:07] think about those that were at the pool
[33:09] of a seder you know they they didn't
[33:12] want to miss they knew that at a certain
[33:13] season at a time the angels gonna come
[33:16] the trouble the water
[33:17] come on so they laid there day and night
[33:20] because they didn't want to miss their
[33:21] opportunity they didn't want to miss the
[33:24] time where God was gonna visit them so
[33:26] they stood there and they waited when
[33:28] that water was troubled they tried all
[33:30] they best to coming him get in why
[33:33] because they didn't know if the angel
[33:35] was coming back or when he was coming
[33:36] back so they wanted to they didn't want
[33:38] to miss their opportunity at air day of
[33:41] visitation they didn't want to miss the
[33:42] time where God was visible but we find
[33:45] that I said just as they had that sense
[33:48] of urgency I said lord give us a sense
[33:50] of urgency Lord coz I believe that even
[33:53] oh you know the Bible says that when the
[33:56] enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit
[33:58] of the Lord or raise up a standard
[33:59] against you know we know that the enemy
[34:02] is coming like a flood come on
[34:04] it's perilous times everywhere it's
[34:06] things that's taking place and like I
[34:08] said they are you look and you say could
[34:10] only get worse from here but it's
[34:12] something about the Spirit of God that
[34:14] keeps you encouraged
[34:16] that you know that he said I never seen
[34:18] the righteous forsaken nor my seed
[34:20] begging for North Sea begging for bread
[34:22] you know that God is gonna take care of
[34:24] you God has come revised you but that
[34:26] faith didn't just come all about but you
[34:28] store it up God has worked out miracles
[34:31] little miracles little battles and
[34:32] little fights and then what it does is
[34:34] Thorn up something in you it built up a
[34:37] faith in you that you know that if God
[34:39] brought me to this like they say God
[34:41] will bring me through that God did
[34:43] something to store up something in you
[34:44] then give you faith in the in the uncle
[34:47] for the oncoming storm to receive
[34:49] victory how many believe that come come
[34:54] on let it say you don't miss your water
[34:55] to your well run dry the day is gonna
[34:57] come when you want to cry out to God but
[35:00] he won't be found come on
[35:02] the days will come where you wanna
[35:04] repeat give God your life and you wish
[35:09] that you didn't play with the
[35:11] opportunity when you had your the wish
[35:13] that you to seize that moment in that
[35:15] time when God was pouring out his spirit
[35:17] to yields your life to him and say Lord
[35:20] it's me god I need your spirit more now
[35:23] more than ever your wish the days are
[35:26] coming that you didn't just have it on
[35:27] your flesh just in your spirit but you
[35:29] opened up hallelujah and you let God
[35:32] engulf you down in the deep the depths
[35:35] of your soul you let God you did more
[35:38] than just conform to a church member but
[35:41] you had a transformation take place
[35:43] you had something down in the deep that
[35:46] no man no preacher no church cutting up
[35:48] root but though you let the Holy Ghost
[35:50] come in and clean out the room you wish
[35:53] you allow God to do something in your
[35:56] life I said I said the days will come
[35:58] come on you know looking at I said you
[36:01] know those are the times I think I said
[36:04] I said something's ringing out and my
[36:06] spirit says store up come on store up
[36:09] the days are coming I thought about
[36:12] those are the wise virgins I said the
[36:15] wise virgins they stored up come on
[36:18] because they knew that the bridegroom
[36:20] was coming they mighta didn't know when
[36:22] he was coming but come on I believe that
[36:24] they had enough
[36:28] spiritual discernment or something to
[36:30] know that hey he might come in the
[36:32] midnight hour and I mean if I got to go
[36:35] out and meet him I need more than just
[36:37] what I got in my lamp I need extra I
[36:40] need enough that when they're in the
[36:43] darkest of our is he come my light will
[36:46] still burn bright come on and that's
[36:48] what we say even today you need extra
[36:50] you need more that there in just not you
[36:54] can just be happy on Sunday or just when
[36:56] you come in the house of God but you
[36:58] need enough fire that'll burn even in
[37:00] the midst of your trial in the missile
[37:02] tribulation and what you're going
[37:04] through no matter what the devil put on
[37:06] you you got enough fire to keep burning
[37:08] you got enough light that when it seemed
[37:10] like the heavens is shut up for you come
[37:13] on you still got a praise on your lips
[37:16] you still got something deep down on the
[37:18] inside that's gonna cry out the Lord
[37:21] giving you take away but blessed be the
[37:23] name of the Lord I don't just have
[37:25] enough but I'm running over come on I
[37:28] believe that but we find that I says you
[37:33] know eat those times I think about I
[37:35] said those wise virgins come on they not
[37:38] only had all in laps but they stored up
[37:40] in a in a vessels as well you know you
[37:44] think about you know that those those
[37:47] foolish virgins that didn't have enough
[37:49] they didn't realize it until the cry was
[37:52] made that they didn't have what it takes
[37:55] come home to go out and meet the
[37:56] bridegroom they realize that the night
[37:59] was too dark and my lamp can go out and
[38:02] I ain't gonna be able to find my way
[38:04] come on they didn't they didn't realize
[38:07] that he would come in just in that time
[38:09] but when they went out come on and they
[38:13] tried to to buy of the oil in then when
[38:17] they came back the Bible says that the
[38:19] door was shut
[38:20] come on they missed a day they missed
[38:22] their hour of visitation because why
[38:24] they didn't have what it takes
[38:26] they didn't store up enough oil to go
[38:29] out and meet the bridegroom come on and
[38:31] I say I want to encourage you and I as
[38:33] individuals tonight come on
[38:35] store up come on this life that we live
[38:39] what is it like it says
[38:41] threescore and ten come on that God is
[38:45] all he really always would give you but
[38:47] even in that time that's no comparison
[38:50] to what concerning eternity is I will
[38:53] share with someone I says you got to
[38:55] make up in your mind that you love God
[38:57] more than anything that you want god bad
[39:01] enough you're willing to give up
[39:02] anything for him come on friends family
[39:05] money everything God you mean that much
[39:08] more to me God if I got to the wall the
[39:11] church if I got this whatever it takes
[39:13] God I'll give up anything Lord because I
[39:17] want you bad enough and you might
[39:18] confess that from your mouth but God
[39:21] knows just what's in your heart
[39:23] and he'll try you by it come on that
[39:26] very thing that's holding dear to you
[39:29] he'll try you buy it for you to prove
[39:32] whether you love God more than him in it
[39:34] and hear more than anything but when he
[39:37] when it comes to that person that's
[39:40] really sold out so that person that got
[39:43] desperate enough hallelujah and they say
[39:46] God I'm tired of the world and all that
[39:48] it has offer God I'm tired of being weak
[39:51] and powerless god I'm tired of going
[39:54] through in and out you don't have enough
[39:56] faith to get up out of the bed in the
[39:58] morning but God I'm turnt Lord when that
[40:00] person they say god I'll do anything
[40:02] Lord whatever it is God that you have on
[40:05] me God I'll do it well God knows when a
[40:08] person gets to that point I think about
[40:11] Jacob and how Jacob he had to get to
[40:13] that point that point of desperation
[40:15] that point to that place that he said
[40:18] I'm tired of running I'm tired of hiding
[40:20] the Esau is in front of me
[40:22] and I don't know what's gonna happen
[40:23] tomorrow the Bible says that he feared
[40:25] him come on it says but I need something
[40:28] right now God he said I won't let you go
[40:30] until you bless me let me know
[40:32] everything gonna be all right when I
[40:34] meet my enemy tomorrow come on we get to
[40:37] those times the way we don't know what's
[40:39] gonna happen tomorrow and we begin to
[40:41] wrestling I say why wait there
[40:43] why don't you Russell now won't you get
[40:45] guarding now it in those times fear
[40:49] won't grip your heart but in those times
[40:51] you can stand or as a bowl soldier or
[40:54] the cross
[40:55] come on fighting the good fight of faith
[40:57] lay hold on eternal life I believe that
[41:01] with all of my heart I said what God
[41:03] dude you know they're talking about you
[41:05] know riding this trail again you know I
[41:08] think about it I believe that the double
[41:10] portion is being our poor come on but
[41:12] what it is it might not be in the group
[41:14] but individual hearts somebody that's
[41:17] somewhere praying crying out because
[41:19] they realize that we don't coming storm
[41:21] you gonna need more than what you got
[41:23] you gonna have to do more than what
[41:25] you're doing you don't have to cry more
[41:28] than will you be crying out why because
[41:30] you need God how many believe that but
[41:34] we find that I says what it is you know
[41:36] you know with those foolish virgins you
[41:40] know we're talking about tonight the
[41:43] days shall come come on they missed
[41:46] their day of visitation I think about
[41:48] our slight Lord it just came to my heart
[41:50] I says when when will the people realize
[41:54] that is more than just in works come on
[41:58] or just in singing or just preaching
[42:02] tithing just coming to church it's more
[42:06] than that come on but it's the life of
[42:08] Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost coming
[42:12] down baptizing you changing you come on
[42:15] as a brother was preaching the other day
[42:17] where all things have become new
[42:19] creating in you a clean heart I mean
[42:22] you're creating your clean heart and
[42:24] renew a right spirit in you come on they
[42:26] the Holy Spirit can come down and fill
[42:29] you up giving you a new mind that when
[42:32] you walk out all old things are passed
[42:34] away but all things have become new
[42:37] now your mind is on only one thing and
[42:39] that's pleasing the Lord Jesus Christ no
[42:42] matter which way the world goes no
[42:43] matter which way the church goes and all
[42:46] those things but you have one of main
[42:48] objective and that's in pleasing the
[42:50] Lord God help me to be pleasing in your
[42:52] sight you know I was walking the other
[42:54] day at the job and I meditated that for
[42:57] I don't know how long
[42:58] just walking I said Lord whatever I do
[43:00] let the words from my mouth and the
[43:02] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[43:04] your sights God the thoughts that I
[43:07] think let it be acceptable
[43:08] your sight the words that I speak Lord
[43:10] let it be acceptable in your sight all I
[43:12] want to do God is please you
[43:15] I think about inna the Bible say inna
[43:17] walk with God come on
[43:19] I believe when Enoch walked with God his
[43:21] main objective was Lord I want to please
[43:24] you God the world might be going
[43:26] deepening darker places but God I want
[43:28] to walk with you Lord
[43:30] I want to please you God it doesn't
[43:33] matter what everybody else is saying
[43:35] this is it's all right to do this come
[43:38] on but in my heart come on I want to
[43:40] serve the Lord
[43:41] it's ruled it it's embedded in me that
[43:44] God I want to please you amongst all God
[43:47] I want to give you everything Lord I
[43:49] believe the song said consume me Lord
[43:51] with the fire of your spirit God wants
[43:54] to burn up all the sin that's in your
[43:56] life God wants to burn out all the
[43:58] iniquity God wants to burn you up
[44:00] hallelujah that he can take place in
[44:03] your life he can have the full
[44:05] preeminence how many want to be consumed
[44:08] by the Lord your spirit come down again
[44:12] and consumers burn us up that I ain't
[44:16] thinking about myself God but I'm only
[44:18] thinking about you
[44:19] God what's pleasing in your sight that's
[44:22] what I want how many want that tonight
[44:24] come on don't miss your hour don't miss
[44:27] the day because the days are come will
[44:29] you wish that you took full advantage
[44:31] come on it's more than that I said but
[44:39] it was a life come on people realize
[44:43] that it's the Spirit of God that makes a
[44:46] difference come on you can have a
[44:51] beautiful voice but it's the noise and
[44:53] that destroys the yokes you can be
[44:56] intellectual and be able to articulate
[44:58] well but it's the noise in that you need
[45:01] it's the power of God that's why every
[45:04] time you're praying I said Lord that's
[45:06] what it is
[45:07] God I'm a can't even know what to say
[45:10] man go blink I said but God just send
[45:12] your spirit Lord I know your spirit
[45:14] that's gonna make the difference God not
[45:16] just a good sermon but God when your
[45:19] spirit comes it brings a word and season
[45:21] it
[45:22] bring something that's gonna destroy
[45:23] yokes that's gonna help somebody what
[45:27] they going through that's gonna break
[45:29] demon powers Oh somebody's life
[45:31] hallelujah and that's what we want I was
[45:34] sharing someone the other day they was
[45:36] telling me about a situation what's
[45:38] going on and and I said you know I said
[45:40] you know just like as Jesus said at one
[45:43] point these kind of come by fasting and
[45:45] praying I said sometimes you got to
[45:47] start make fast sometimes you got to get
[45:49] on your knees and pray because you
[45:51] within yourself you can't handle that
[45:53] situation you don't know what to do you
[45:55] only make matters worse so I said I
[45:58] learned in the Christian journey
[45:59] sometimes you can only just put up your
[46:02] hands get down on your knees and give it
[46:04] to God over in prayer and say Lord we've
[46:06] done all we can do now I'm taking my
[46:09] hands off the situation Lord I want you
[46:11] to handle it God come on I'm fasting I'm
[46:14] praying God is still Spirit that I need
[46:17] to come and take care of this situation
[46:18] and God to do it God are doing when he
[46:22] sees that you mean business it's in the
[46:28] Spirit of God that makes the difference
[46:30] I thought about I thought about Sampson
[46:32] come on and how you know after his hairs
[46:37] cut off and then they begin to tell him
[46:40] Samson the Philistines are upon you come
[46:43] on he might have felt the same
[46:44] he might have physically felt he did as
[46:47] a matter of fact because when he got up
[46:49] what did he say I'm gonna go shake
[46:51] myself just as I did the other times he
[46:54] felt like his old self he still felt
[46:56] like he was able to go out meet the
[46:59] enemy but he found out that it was just
[47:03] the anointing that made the difference
[47:04] you think about Samson in the Bible it
[47:07] didn't fail the mission and when every
[47:10] time when he came against any certain
[47:13] things the Bible said that the Spirit of
[47:15] the Lord came upon him come on and
[47:17] that's what made the difference the
[47:19] noise hallelujah no quickening power
[47:22] when it came he might have felt like he
[47:25] was still the same he might have felt
[47:28] like things were still all right but he
[47:30] walked out didn't know that God wouldn't
[47:32] with him come on I think about Ezekiel
[47:34] and
[47:35] I was showing them in the temple and it
[47:38] says look how the people lives are look
[47:40] at how they living and all that it says
[47:42] my glory is departed from them they
[47:44] would still go on doing the ritual but
[47:47] they wouldn't realize that the glory of
[47:48] the Lord wasn't there no more come on
[47:50] but they'd find out when their enemies
[47:52] came upon them and we find that even
[47:54] today sometimes we feel comfortable with
[47:57] just feel all going through the motion
[47:59] going through the rituals still going to
[48:01] church feeling a jump in the Shelf every
[48:03] now and then thinking that's all right
[48:05] but when the lie of show up come on when
[48:07] the enemy come what you'll realize then
[48:10] that it was the Spirit of God that she
[48:12] was missing it was the very life of
[48:15] Jesus Christ that made a difference
[48:17] hallelujah and that's what we need more
[48:21] than anything come on
[48:23] I says you know I was thinking about
[48:26] that how Ezekiel was saying it you know
[48:29] something about how I was talking about
[48:32] topic tonight the day shall come I was
[48:35] thinking about Ezekiel or how he was
[48:37] made a watchman he was looking he can
[48:39] see the condition of the people and he
[48:41] began to prophesy and told him and tell
[48:43] him what was coming ahead come on the
[48:44] day's gonna come come on the days is
[48:47] coming where God won't put up with the
[48:49] things you were doing no Mon God
[48:51] might've just give you a space and
[48:53] opportunity repent right now but the
[48:56] days are coming when your enemies is
[48:58] gonna be so much among you come on that
[49:01] some of you'll be scattered in the wind
[49:02] the ones that went destroyed by the fire
[49:05] or discord but I thank God even in that
[49:08] God still allowed a little grease come
[49:10] on
[49:10] but he says that in that time he said
[49:13] the day is gonna come where you wish you
[49:16] could've gave God your all the days will
[49:19] come come on in tribulation trial Jesus
[49:22] told him that when your enemies call him
[49:24] he gon have no mercy on you say he ain't
[49:27] gonna leave not one stone left upon
[49:29] another he ain't gonna leave the mother
[49:31] with the children but he gonna he gonna
[49:33] destroy them all
[49:34] come on the days of call me said why
[49:36] because you didn't know you're out you
[49:39] didn't know today
[49:40] you missed the hour of opportunity you
[49:42] miss that window your time of visitation
[49:45] with God want to do something special in
[49:47] your life just in that
[49:49] moment you know God is only required if
[49:51] he's only obligated to call a man once
[49:53] after that he can shut the door never
[49:55] call them again that's why when God
[49:57] begins to call him and tugging on your
[49:59] heart you want to give God all you got
[50:01] right then I think about the demand
[50:03] building the barns and he didn't know
[50:05] you know the Bible called him a fool
[50:07] didn't he says that you didn't know that
[50:09] just in this very night your soul is
[50:11] gonna be required and I said that's what
[50:13] it is the devil he got away he has a way
[50:17] of convincing people that they have time
[50:20] convince some people that everything
[50:23] gonna be all right especially to young
[50:24] you know he's got a way of doing those
[50:28] things that convincing you that you know
[50:30] everything gonna be all right you got
[50:31] enough time and all these things but not
[50:34] knowing that every man he's got at a
[50:37] point of time his days is numbered and
[50:39] when that's it that's it come on he that
[50:42] we talk about heat is holy let him be
[50:44] holy still in that day come on he that
[50:47] is filthy let him be filthy still I said
[50:49] God I don't want you to find me in
[50:50] myself or weeds in my Knicks here in my
[50:53] field but God I don't know I thought I'd
[50:55] you brought me too too far guard to
[50:58] leave me come on you know God has
[50:59] brought some of us do some great storm
[51:02] trials and some great storms God brought
[51:04] some of us off drugs brought some of us
[51:06] out of prison or whatever whatever life
[51:09] you know change was so dark in there
[51:11] things were holding you but God brought
[51:13] you all the way out God brought you
[51:15] through come on then you get to a place
[51:17] and your Christian journey the way you
[51:19] don't want to give God all you got the
[51:21] way you want to hold back on God after
[51:23] all God has done for you come on I said
[51:26] God you brought me too far come on not
[51:30] just say that he brought me this far to
[51:32] leave me come on let God bring you this
[51:33] far for you to leave him but let him
[51:36] bring you this far and say God whatever
[51:38] I got to do god I ain't gonna let you go
[51:40] Lord matter of fact God I don't want to
[51:42] adored you but it's saying that God's
[51:43] got a cook in me and I don't want to get
[51:45] it loose dog hold on the me Lord come on
[51:48] all things God hold on to me never never
[51:51] let me forget your grace remind me all
[51:54] the time of the mercies of God in my
[51:56] life
[51:56] remind me all the time daughter where I
[51:59] could have been well should have been
[52:00] God but what you've done for me
[52:02] me over those days lest I want to forget
[52:05] or what you've done for me God didn't
[52:07] what it would do it a cause a man to get
[52:09] back down on his knees again hallelujah
[52:12] repent even of his very thoughts God if
[52:15] I thought wrong Lord help me Lord
[52:17] because I know you've been too good to
[52:19] me Lord how many believe that today God
[52:26] has been too good to us I said the days
[52:30] shall come I think about that I says
[52:32] what it is you know Jesus he in here in
[52:37] the scriptures he was talking about it
[52:38] and how you know they didn't realize
[52:40] they blessing their opportunity and how
[52:43] he was saying how that they were blinded
[52:45] he was talking about how but we read
[52:47] here in the in the in the 42nd verse he
[52:52] says if you would only evaluate always
[52:54] known even listen this day this this day
[52:59] the things which belong to that peace
[53:01] but now he's talking about how their I
[53:03] hid it from their eyes and we know that
[53:05] God had a plan that he would even blind
[53:09] his own children that you and I could
[53:12] receive of that grace of God you and I
[53:14] who were without the camp you and I who
[53:17] didn't even wasn't even a County even
[53:20] wordly but God did all of that just so
[53:23] that you and I he would open our eyes
[53:25] come on
[53:26] that we'll be able to see who he is come
[53:28] on and I've said even in that God open
[53:31] in our eyes I said if you blind the
[53:33] dance because you willfully blind you
[53:35] shows you know not to see you fought
[53:38] past all those things I like us reading
[53:40] how the other week how the scriptures
[53:42] says that it was gonna come or the time
[53:46] was gonna come way to people they
[53:48] weren't going do her sound doctrine but
[53:50] they was gonna turn the air to fables
[53:52] come on it talks about in time that and
[53:54] I believe it was in Romans house says
[53:56] that when they when they knew God they
[53:58] worship him not as God but but a rather
[54:00] sort of creature more than the Creator
[54:02] going on about these things and then
[54:04] doing those things that they know that
[54:06] people are worthy of death not only do
[54:08] they do them but they have pleasure and
[54:10] knows in
[54:11] they have pleasure in them you know the
[54:13] Bible called him he talked about their
[54:15] minds
[54:16] come on being a reprobate it wasn't that
[54:18] they were born that way it wasn't that
[54:20] they were blinded the whole time but
[54:22] when they knew God their eyes were open
[54:24] they knew who he was but they chose not
[54:26] to serve him they chose the good to
[54:29] blind them so they chose their gold
[54:31] paths I said a lot of times people they
[54:33] know right from wrong they know things
[54:35] why because their very heart condemn
[54:37] them but they fight pass it any way they
[54:39] go pass it anyway why because they want
[54:41] to please the flesh more than they would
[54:43] please God come on but the days will
[54:47] come when they'll want to please God the
[54:52] days will come when they'll wish they
[54:54] had let it all go when they wished they
[54:57] had a turn they ear to what the Spirit
[54:59] of the Lord was saying the days will
[55:01] come what they'll realize just how
[55:04] important the Holy Ghost was the days
[55:06] will come but he says your enemies that
[55:08] be compassed all about you come on
[55:10] and he said all of this is because you
[55:13] didn't know you're out you didn't know
[55:14] your day
[55:15] you missed your time of visitation the
[55:17] time regarde was gonna do something
[55:20] great in your life come on I said don't
[55:22] miss your hour don't miss your time
[55:24] don't miss your season regard is giving
[55:28] you a period of grace but take full
[55:30] advantage of what God is doing even now
[55:32] amen
[55:48] but about what sister Robinson said to
[55:51] be ready be ready when he come again
[55:57] don't let him catch you what you work
[55:59] undone amen
[56:01] she says not get ready but be ready so
[56:07] by the grace of God we see the world in
[56:09] its condition we see South Carolina
[56:13] numbers are going up and now we have the
[56:19] hides count today 700 in something with
[56:23] virus and continually going up

[57:01] know during this week of fasting and
[57:03] praying you know you praying for
[57:06] direction praying for guidance praying
[57:11] that Lord speak to our hearts and tell
[57:15] us what you want done and just know let
[57:20] us go through the motion we need to know
[57:24] what God wants to do in our lives what
[57:28] direction he wanted to take the church
[57:32] we thank the Lord for gear creek because
[57:38] they said they would like to sell us all
[57:40] the property all the way down to the
[57:43] railroad so by the grace of God
[57:52] and that's something we were dressing
[57:56] the Lord with twenty-something years but
[58:01] by the grace of God the different one
[58:06] says just claim it just claim and so by
[58:11] the grace of God we thank God for that I
[58:13] want to say don't get ready be ready the

[58:29] again and I'm saying it's time for us to

[58:39] were going to have service and I think
[58:41] the brothers said they wanted to have it
[58:43] and inside on Sunday but the numbers are

[58:58] set up under the tent or whatever on
[59:02] side me 10:00 10:30 I want to say to you

[59:12] for leadership and guidance those that
[59:15] want to come out and come in the inside
[59:17] on Friday night
[59:19] you're welcome we just got a few on the
[59:22] inside so if you like to come on the
[59:24] inside on Friday night

[59:44] and we're not gonna worry we're not
[59:46] wearing we just trusting the Lord to
[59:48] give us leadership and guidance and
[59:52] sometimes you have to stand still and
[59:53] wait on the Lord
[59:55] so we waiting on the Lord
[1:00:00] are you scared fear has told meetings of
[1:00:06] the devil I know some people that are
[1:00:09] going on to be with the Lord or whatever
[1:00:11] they said they're not fearing the virus
[1:00:17] but some of them just going on to be
[1:00:20] with the law one way or the other it's
[1:00:27] not fear but being why the serpent
[1:00:30] harmless is go and let's be wise
[1:00:37] sometimes you you're looking out for the
[1:00:40] person that think they got faith and
[1:00:43] don't have it and sometimes folk don't
[1:00:48] know how much faith they really have but
[1:00:53] they got faith servant of God says I you
[1:00:58] over there and he was able to point out
