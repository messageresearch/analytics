[40:03] this morning. If you have a special
[40:05] need, you can make it known by the
[40:06] lifting of your hands. Heavenly Father,
[40:10] Lord, we come to you this morning as
[40:12] humble as we know how, Lord. Oh God, to
[40:15] say thank you for your grace, Lord. And
[40:17] oh Lord, bringing us through another
[40:19] week, Lord. And oh God, Lord, there's so
[40:22] many, Lord, to pray for this morning.
[40:24] And but God, you know them all by name.
[40:26] And Lord, we pray, God, that you go by
[40:28] and meet the needs. Lord, we pray for
[40:30] those hands that are lifted, Lord, the
[40:32] hearts that have gone up this morning
[40:34] for you. God, I pray that you would
[40:36] bless them, Lord, this morning. Oh God,
[40:39] we see, oh God, the weather outside,
[40:41] Lord, and oh God, we just pray, Lord,
[40:43] that you'd bless your children, Lord.
[40:45] And those that have pressed their way
[40:47] out, those that have desired to come,
[40:49] Lord, this morning, but just couldn't
[40:51] make it, Lord. I just pray you grant
[40:53] them, oh God, the blessings, Lord. Oh
[40:56] God, give them the desires of their
[40:57] heart. Lord, we thank you, Lord. As we
[41:00] look to you, Lord, uh, oh God, open your
[41:02] word. I just pray, God, that if we said
[41:04] or done anything that ain't like you, oh
[41:06] Lord, if it would hinder or move, God,
[41:08] this morning, your spirit, oh God, from
[41:11] having its way, Lord, we pray that you
[41:13] would forgive us and, oh God, help us to
[41:15] get out of your way, Lord, and find the
[41:17] inspiration of the Holy Ghost, Lord,
[41:19] that we might be able to hear from
[41:21] heaven. Do it for us, God. I pray move
[41:24] in a mighty way, Lord, for we love you.
[41:27] We appreciate you. In Jesus Christ's
[41:29] name we pray. Amen. Amen. God is good.
[41:33] Amen. We want to look at the book of
[41:35] Luke by the grace of God. Luke this
[41:38] morning, Luke uh the 8th chapter and
[41:41] we'll begin at the the 50th verse. Amen.
[41:50] Y'all feel all right this morning?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen.
[41:55] Luke 8 and we'll begin here at the the
[41:58] 50th verse.
[42:01] You got it. Say amen. We'll begin at the
[42:03] 49th 49th verse.
[42:06] Amen. You got it. Say amen. And it
[42:10] reads, "While he yet spake there, there
[42:14] cometh one of the ruler of the syn of
[42:17] the synagogue. How sang to him, thy
[42:20] daughter is um it says, thy daughter is
[42:23] dead." uh trouble not the master. But
[42:26] when Jesus heard it, did I read that
[42:29] right?
[42:31] When Jesus heard it, he answered him,
[42:33] saying, "Fear not. Believe only, and she
[42:37] shall be made whole." And when he came
[42:40] in into the house, he suffered no man to
[42:43] go in, say Peter and James and John, and
[42:46] the father and the mother of the maiden,
[42:49] and all wept, and beweld her. But he
[42:53] said, "Weep not, she is not dead, but
[42:55] she sleepeth." And they laughed him to
[42:58] scorn, knowing that she was dead. And he
[43:02] put them all out, and took her by the
[43:05] hand, and called, saying, "Made, arise."
[43:08] And her spirit came again, and she arose
[43:11] straight away. And he commanded to give
[43:14] her meat. And her parents were
[43:16] astonished. But he charged them that
[43:18] they should tell no man what was done.
[43:22] May God have bless the reading of his
[43:23] word. You may be seated this morning by
[43:25] the grace of God. We want to talk about
[43:28] this morning choosing faith over fear.
[43:31] Amen. Choosing faith over fear. Now you
[43:36] know I says, you know, you got to make a
[43:38] choice now, right? Come on. I says you
[43:41] can choose to to fear, right?
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Or you can choose to have faith.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know many of times Jesus when
[43:49] he dealt with situations uh he says um
[43:52] to the people or when he come to work a
[43:55] miracle the first thing he would do is
[43:56] say what fear not right he had to deal
[43:59] with fear right fear not and have what
[44:03] faith come on I says you got it's a
[44:06] choice you make right and I says the
[44:08] reason why you know I was thinking and I
[44:10] was because I I got a lot here but I was
[44:12] thinking I said it's one thing you know
[44:14] when you making a choice Right? I says
[44:17] you know what happens is you know the
[44:20] first choice that most people choose is
[44:22] what fear right because you know things
[44:25] come upon you and what brings it like
[44:27] the brother Simmons was preaching the
[44:28] other night about these five senses
[44:30] right they bring that they bring that
[44:32] fear because you know faith is is not
[44:34] contacted by those things see faith is
[44:36] something that you can't see like it
[44:38] says you have no knowledge of it right
[44:41] but it's still it's it that's what
[44:43] brings those things that were not as
[44:45] though They were right. So what happens
[44:48] is a fear what it is take start begins
[44:52] to take take root in you right you know
[44:54] the prophet of God talking about the
[44:55] greatest battle ever fought was in the
[44:57] mind right and he says the reason why
[45:00] being in the mind because that's where
[45:02] the decisions are made at right so what
[45:04] happens is you know uh uh like we says
[45:06] you got to choose a faith over fear what
[45:09] happens is you know in your mind
[45:12] automatically you know a scenery a
[45:15] battle is taking place Right. And what
[45:17] it is, whoever wins the battleground of
[45:19] the mind, that's what's going that's
[45:20] who's going to dominate. How many
[45:22] believe that this morning? So, we find
[45:24] that I was I was looking at the other
[45:26] day and Numbers 13, I know you read it
[45:27] the other night, but I says uh uh if
[45:29] they were to only, you know, uh uh you
[45:32] know, look back when they got across the
[45:34] land of all the things that God had did
[45:37] for them already, right? if they going
[45:39] to only like like I was saying the other
[45:41] night remember you know that hey when I
[45:43] was in Egypt you see you got to real you
[45:46] got to look back at the time when you
[45:48] was hopeless right and the time when you
[45:50] knew that you couldn't do it and all of
[45:52] a sudden God showed up didn't he and he
[45:55] began doing things in your life working
[45:57] miracles and all right so he brought you
[46:00] out so if it was him bringing you out
[46:02] right and you ain't had nothing to do
[46:04] with it then why you try to inject
[46:05] yourself in it now
[46:07] &gt;&gt; hallelujah But that's what the devil
[46:09] does, ain't it? Tries to get you to
[46:10] think that you got a part to play. Only
[46:12] part I believe you and I got to play is
[46:14] to praise God and keep on on our
[46:16] journey. Right?
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. I believe that. You
[46:20] know, one thing about it when you
[46:21] choosing when you making that choice,
[46:23] just like Joshua was telling him, choose
[46:25] you this day, right? Who you going to
[46:27] serve? He says, if you going to serve
[46:28] the other gods or whatever, he said
[46:30] serve them, right? But I want to tell
[46:32] you, look what it is. He I'm I'm going
[46:34] let you look now. What did those other
[46:36] gods do for you? They had you in
[46:38] bondage, right? They had you in trouble
[46:40] all the time, didn't they? They had you
[46:41] sick. They had you this. He says, "But
[46:43] if you going to serve the Lord, what did
[46:45] God do for you?" Hallelujah. All he ever
[46:48] done was heal you, right? All he ever
[46:50] done was come see about you. All he ever
[46:52] done was Hallelujah. be good to you,
[46:55] right? So he said, "You can make your
[46:57] choice, but as for me in my house,
[46:59] hallelujah, we going to serve the Lord,
[47:01] right? We going to stay with God because
[47:03] God has been too good to us."
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come what may, let who go and
[47:08] turn whatever may. I know one thing God
[47:11] has been too good to us. Hallelujah. So
[47:13] one thing we find that I says you know
[47:16] uh we find that it says here here Jesus
[47:19] he had to deal with it right deal with
[47:21] the fear. So he was in there, you know,
[47:24] going on his healing campaign, right?
[47:26] And something about it, it looks like
[47:28] people had to come to a place in their
[47:30] life like it looked like the people
[47:32] would have came to a place to where they
[47:35] seen Jesus do enough, right? That they
[47:38] can look and say that I seen them do
[47:40] enough. I don't have to doubt them.
[47:41] Hallelujah. And so that woman that had
[47:44] the issue, she had already seen, she had
[47:46] already heard, maybe she heard, right?
[47:48] Yeah. So, she already made her decision,
[47:50] right? That I'm going to choose faith
[47:52] over fear. Hallelujah. Right. Even
[47:55] though they say I got it, nobody can
[47:57] help me. But I heard what this man is
[47:59] doing. Hallelujah. And if I can just get
[48:02] close enough to him to touch the hem of
[48:04] his garment, something happened, right?
[48:07] That's what her faith told her, ain't
[48:08] it? I can see the battle going taking
[48:10] place. But she chose to have faith. And
[48:13] what did her faith cause her to do?
[48:15] Press her way on out anyway. Right. when
[48:17] people that's what it is what it is say
[48:19] it's a it's a battle right people like
[48:22] was saying I was I was studying this and
[48:24] I says what it is you know um sometimes
[48:27] you can talk to the wrong people about
[48:28] your situation
[48:30] &gt;&gt; come on
[48:31] &gt;&gt; ain't that the truth come on you talk to
[48:33] the wrong person about it and you'll be
[48:35] worse off than you was you say a lot of
[48:38] times hey I I'm starting to feel this
[48:40] crook in my neck right and somebody say
[48:44] oh man it might be this you might have
[48:46] pulled a muscle You might need this. And
[48:48] next thing you know, your neck hurting
[48:49] way worse than it was before you talked
[48:51] to that person. Ain't it? Come on.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen now.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; I know I ain't the only one that deal
[48:57] with that.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got a little light headache. Oh
[49:00] man, I heard somebody go as far as say
[49:01] it might be a tumor in the brain.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; You need to go get that checked out.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. I always tell the testimony.
[49:09] That's why we says choosing faith,
[49:11] right, over fear. Hallelujah. I remember
[49:14] I had uh matter of fact the same night
[49:16] that brother Simmons had prayed for. I
[49:18] was saying uh uh I was tell testimony at
[49:21] work and uh I mean I was talking about
[49:23] it some years ago cuz they had been
[49:24] bothering me for a while and one of the
[49:26] boys at work was saying how it could be
[49:28] a broken uh shin was I was just showing
[49:30] them that it wasn't as bad at the time.
[49:32] I was showing them that and he was
[49:34] explaining to me what it was but what
[49:36] happened to him and all this and I could
[49:38] when he started talking to me it felt
[49:40] like all of he was just sucking me on
[49:42] in. Right. And all of a sudden as he was
[49:44] talking to me, I said, "Man, get away
[49:46] from me like that." Like he said,
[49:47] "What?" I said, "Man, get away from me
[49:49] like that." He didn't know. He was like,
[49:51] "What?" I said, "No, I ain't I walked. I
[49:52] don't want to hear that." Right? Cuz
[49:54] what it is, he sucked you on in. Right?
[49:57] People don't know it, but the devil be
[49:59] doing that, don't it? The devil anoint
[50:01] people, don't he?
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus had to tell Peter, "Get
[50:04] behind me." Right? He said, "You don't
[50:06] you don't know what it is." Uh uh. He
[50:08] didn't know what he was saying. But
[50:10] that's why it says what? What I was
[50:12] telling somebody the other day, you got
[50:13] to get all that negative talk away.
[50:15] Right.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; You got to think. You got to start
[50:18] talking positive. Even a situation this
[50:20] bad, you still got to think positive.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Like the song says, you got to still
[50:24] say, "Lord, I'mma rise above it all."
[50:26] Hallelujah.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; I was the other day just enjoying the
[50:29] Lord by myself in the house, right? I
[50:31] says, a little song came on that
[50:34] everything is working together for my
[50:36] good. Hallelujah. So I started looking
[50:38] at all situations, right? And all
[50:40] trials. And I started saying to those
[50:42] trials, all things. Hallelujah. Come on.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; God, it is not one trial out. All
[50:48] things. Hallelujah. And I start look I
[50:51] started looking. I said, you know what?
[50:52] Every every trial I'm going look all
[50:54] things no matter what it is.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come what may, I'm choosing
[50:59] faith over fear. Hallelujah. I know that
[51:02] all things going to work together for my
[51:05] good. Hallelujah. How do you know that?
[51:07] Because the word said it would.
[51:08] Hallelujah.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. And I believe the word,
[51:12] right? Come on. All things. Come on. Not
[51:15] some things. Come on. And then I started
[51:17] cuz I go there in Romans 8. I started
[51:19] saying to myself, uh uh what shall we
[51:22] say then to these things? Right. Come
[51:24] on. I was riding exercise bike in the
[51:26] morning. I was riding. I says, "What
[51:29] shall we say to these things?" Right? I
[51:31] said, "What things?" I started calling
[51:33] out all kind of things, right? What
[51:35] shall we say then?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; I'm choosing faith over fear.
[51:40] Hallelujah.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Paul talked about persecutions, trials.
[51:44] He says, "For I reckon that the
[51:46] sufferings of this present time ain't
[51:48] worthy to be compared with the glory
[51:51] that God's got in store for us."
[51:52] Hallelujah. What shall we say to these
[51:55] things?
[51:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't say you wouldn't have trials,
[51:58] did he? Come on. But he says, "What
[52:00] say?" And I like how he goes on to say,
[52:02] "If God before us," Hallelujah. Come on,
[52:04] somebody ought to give God praise this
[52:06] morning. I said, if God be before us,
[52:08] Hallelujah. Who can be against us? Come
[52:11] on.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; I'm choosing faith over fear. Come on.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; If God before us, I don't know about
[52:18] you, I says, what it is, you got to know
[52:20] that God is on your side.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Not is he only on your side, but he's on
[52:24] the inside. Hallelujah.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And when he's on the inside, you know,
[52:28] when Jesus was on that ship that night,
[52:30] that ship couldn't be sunk.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Could it? Come on. The master was on
[52:35] that ship. You couldn't you he had you
[52:37] couldn't sink that ship, right?
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah.
[52:42] Something about it, but they didn't know
[52:44] wind blowing rain. Come on. But then
[52:45] they only they thought about it. Come
[52:47] on. Oh, Jesus is down there.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Let me go wake him up. First thing he do
[52:52] is he say, "Oh, you little faith."
[52:54] Right?
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Stood up said, "Uh, peace be still."
[52:58] Right?
[52:59] &gt;&gt; And the wind and the waves obeyed him.
[53:01] Look like that would have been enough
[53:02] that throughout the rest of their life
[53:04] from then on they would have chose faith
[53:05] over fear. Right? Long as he is with us,
[53:08] right? Don't you know one thing about
[53:10] it? He says that if you would only
[53:12] believe. Come on.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; So all these signs will follow them that
[53:15] believe in my name. Come on. Ain't
[53:18] nothing standing before that name.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. Nothing.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No trial, nothing standing
[53:25] before that name.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's why if you go in your
[53:27] own name, you got to fight. But one
[53:29] thing about it, when you put the name of
[53:31] Jesus out there, hallelujah, Jesus.
[53:33] Hallelujah.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. They used to sing that
[53:37] little song, when I call Jesus, he'll
[53:39] answer prayer. Hallelujah. Come on. And
[53:41] he will. Hallelujah. How many believe
[53:43] that this morning? But what it is in
[53:45] your mind. Come on. You got to choose
[53:47] faith over fear, right?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; People start creating things, don't
[53:51] they?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; That's what happens.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day, I
[53:55] said, "Come on, trying to get you away
[53:57] from that." I say, "What you got to do?
[53:58] you got to have is I got faith. And I
[54:00] know but it's a when you say you got
[54:02] faith, ain't no buts about it.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; It's I got I believe and that's it.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Ain't know I believe but you know you
[54:11] either believe or you don't.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh hallelujah. That's the truth
[54:15] ain't it?
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; God I believe thy word oh Lord is
[54:18] settled in heaven.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe you.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm going start calling it already.
[54:25] It's already here. Right. Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe God. Hallelujah. But what
[54:29] it is, I was trying to share that with
[54:31] somebody the other day. Well, I said,
[54:33] you know, uh uh uh the battleground that
[54:35] said is in the mind and you got a
[54:37] choice, right? You know, the the Hebrew
[54:39] uh the Israelites had a choice when they
[54:42] got to the land, right? And and the
[54:44] spies went over. They got to see it,
[54:47] right? I don't want to go over all that.
[54:48] No. Uh brother Simmons other night, he
[54:50] took all my points. But they got over
[54:52] they got in the land, right? They went
[54:54] over there. spies went over there and
[54:56] they came back with the fruits, right?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. And they say, "We
[55:01] ain't doubting you, Moses, that that the
[55:03] land is just like what God said it is."
[55:05] Hallelujah. We ain't doubting that now.
[55:07] Come on. Come on. Oh, hallelujah. God
[55:10] brought us out with a mighty hand. Come
[55:12] on. Just like he said, didn't he? One
[55:14] thing about it, you could have looked
[55:16] back and said, "God ain't never fail us
[55:17] yet." Hallelujah. He did everything he
[55:20] said. Why would he fail us now?
[55:21] Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on.
[55:25] Hallelujah. That's the way I look at all
[55:27] my trials now. Come on.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; I said that God done brought me this
[55:30] far. Why would he bring me this far to
[55:32] leave me?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Why would he bring, you know, I was
[55:34] singing, they sing that little song the
[55:35] other day on the radio. I mean on on the
[55:37] thing says I come too far to turn
[55:39] around. Hallelujah.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I come too far.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Why would God leave me now? But what it
[55:45] is, the devil tell you that, right? God
[55:47] got you out here. What I feel like the
[55:49] Hebrew boys, even if he don't, he's
[55:51] able. Hallelujah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm choosing to believe God.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; I don't got nowhere else to go.
[55:57] Hallelujah. I don't got nowhere else to
[55:59] to trust. I ain't got nobody else.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Come on. If I'm out here by myself,
[56:03] might as well keep believing on them.
[56:05] Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. I'm already out
[56:08] here by the devil. You're out here by
[56:09] yourself, then what I'm going to do.
[56:10] Hallelujah. Might as well keep waiting
[56:12] on them, right? Oh, Jesus. But you got
[56:15] to choose. Like I says, you know, when
[56:17] the thing about it, when those spies
[56:20] came back, come on, with the very fruits
[56:22] of the land. This was the test of all
[56:23] test, wasn't it? Now they come back with
[56:27] fruit, carrying it. Oh, the great they
[56:29] was rejoicing when they saw fruit. Come
[56:31] on. But then now what happens? Uh the
[56:36] the the other 10 spies say, "Oh, but the
[56:39] land giants over there. Come on. The
[56:42] wall cities. Come on. Think about they
[56:45] too strong for us." And they said, "And
[56:47] we in our own eyes." Who asked you to
[56:49] use your eyes? Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:52] We in our own sight. Who asked you to
[56:54] look?
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. You in your own sight in Egypt
[56:57] couldn't get out.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; You didn't see your way out of that, did
[57:00] you? But God brought you out, didn't he?
[57:02] Hallelujah. Trust and believe.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At the Red Sea, you couldn't
[57:08] see your way out of that. Neither could
[57:10] you.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. But here he is. Fear not.
[57:12] Hallelujah. Speak. Right. Come on. Cry
[57:15] not. Speak. Right? Why you crying unto
[57:17] me? Speak. What he told Moses. Right.
[57:19] Moses began to tell him. Come on. the
[57:21] Egyptians. You see the day. Come on. You
[57:23] won't see after the day, you won't see
[57:25] them no more forever. Right?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz what he said, God is going to fight
[57:28] for you. Hallelujah.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. The day. Can you remember that
[57:32] day?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; When you were there, didn't you heard
[57:36] Moses say, "God is going to fight for
[57:38] you."
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. You were, but get away from
[57:43] that fear. God is doing the fighting.
[57:45] Hallelujah. When you ain't the one
[57:46] fighting and your big brother is
[57:48] fighting like they say in in the old
[57:50] times when he fighting you ain't worried
[57:51] my big brother fighting. Hallelujah.
[57:53] Right. Come on. That's the truth.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; You know one thing about it I was
[58:00] looking at I was I was looking at some
[58:02] things. It says fear over faith. I mean
[58:04] faith over fear. Right. You got a
[58:06] choice. Right. I was looking at one
[58:08] thing uh with Mike Tyson. Right. People
[58:12] see saw Mike Tyson's Iron Mike. He was a
[58:15] he was a mean like bad per he was the
[58:18] knockout king right you go around him
[58:21] you might tremble right but one thing
[58:24] about it I know some boys from New York
[58:26] was telling me some stories about Mike
[58:28] Tyson and clubs up there say he wasn't
[58:30] just he wasn't just no say he was from
[58:33] the I ain't going to say that word of
[58:35] the pit he was from the street for real
[58:36] wasn't he
[58:37] &gt;&gt; come on
[58:39] says man he went to a store once and a
[58:42] gang leader heard he was down there on
[58:44] the block at the
[58:45] showed up with a whole entourage of
[58:47] people. Mike wasn't afraid though. Mike
[58:50] came out, knocked him out and left him
[58:51] out on the street cold. Come on. The
[58:53] gang leader. Then he got up talking
[58:55] about Mike Snookie. Right. But one thing
[58:58] about I saw a video
[59:01] of of him and he was fighting,
[59:04] especially in his younger years. Most of
[59:06] the fights didn't go past two rounds,
[59:09] but he had been out there before one
[59:11] fight crying like a baby.
[59:14] They got a video of him crying like a
[59:15] baby. His his trainer said, "What's
[59:17] wrong, Mike?" He said, "I'm scared to go
[59:19] in there. I'm scared I'mma lose." And
[59:21] the trainer was like, "Mike," he said.
[59:23] He leaned Big Mike leaned his head on
[59:25] that man's shoulder. He patting him like
[59:27] a baby saying, "Go ahead and get it
[59:28] out." Cuz when you get in the ring, you
[59:29] can't have you. You can only think about
[59:31] one thing and that's winning.
[59:32] Hallelujah.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. Go ahead and get it out your
[59:35] system. Right? You know that same
[59:38] fighting when they knock that man out
[59:39] the first round. But what it is, come
[59:41] on. I says, "What?" That's why you got
[59:43] to get fear away from you, right?
[59:45] &gt;&gt; When you out there fighting, you can't
[59:47] be worried about whether I'm going to
[59:48] win or lose. Hallelujah. You got to have
[59:50] one thing on your mind and that's the
[59:52] victory. Hallelujah. Come on. I believe
[59:55] that. How many believe that this
[59:56] morning? But the devil gets you out
[59:58] there fearing. Come on. But what it is
[1:00:00] because faith can't operate there,
[1:00:02] right? I mean, yeah, faith can't operate
[1:00:04] there. But when you cast down all fears,
[1:00:06] right?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. And you standing there, then
[1:00:09] what it is, that's the ground that God
[1:00:11] want to show up, right? Hallelujah.
[1:00:13] That's why he begin to work his mighty
[1:00:15] works.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. But what it is, you got to
[1:00:17] choose that, don't you?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Those Hebrew boys, I mean, those
[1:00:22] Israelites there at the land, come on.
[1:00:24] When when the 10 spies begin to give
[1:00:27] that evil report, look at what it did to
[1:00:29] their minds.
[1:00:31] Come on.
[1:00:32] That clouded that report
[1:00:36] clouded out all of what God had already
[1:00:38] done for them.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. All the victories that God had
[1:00:42] already won for them, that evil report
[1:00:45] wiped all that out of their mind, didn't
[1:00:46] it?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, I know God did this, but I don't
[1:00:52] know if he can do that. Hallelujah. Come
[1:00:54] on. I want to tell you something. If God
[1:00:56] can save me from a life of sin and
[1:00:58] shame, hallelujah. If God can bring me
[1:01:00] from the muck into the mighty clay, if
[1:01:02] he can clean me up and fill me with his
[1:01:04] precious Holy Ghost, I know God can do
[1:01:06] all things. Hallelujah. Why would he do
[1:01:08] that? Hallelujah.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Say, why would he clean you up
[1:01:12] and not use you? Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Why would he clean you up? You
[1:01:16] like a glass of dishes you wash off, you
[1:01:18] put them up in the shelves. I'mma wash
[1:01:19] them off. But why if you ain't going to
[1:01:21] never use them again, why you do that,
[1:01:23] right? Come on. But you clean them up
[1:01:24] cuz you going to use them one day.
[1:01:26] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't worry about where you
[1:01:31] at now. Just let the master clean you
[1:01:33] up.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't worry about what part
[1:01:36] you going to play. Just let the master
[1:01:38] clean you up
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; and he'll use you how he want to use
[1:01:41] you. Hallelujah. And one thing about
[1:01:43] him, you can't tell God who to use.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I was reading that scripture. I listen
[1:01:48] to that scripture the other day,
[1:01:49] yesterday, I think it was. I was telling
[1:01:51] Charlotte, it stirred me up. I think
[1:01:53] it's Romans nine and how he was saying
[1:01:56] he says God have mercy on whomever he
[1:01:58] will. Hallelujah.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Right. He saying him that run will but
[1:02:02] it's the God that showeth the mercy.
[1:02:03] Right.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; He says God what it is. So we say, "Hey,
[1:02:06] God this and that." Come on. You You
[1:02:08] can't tell God. God have mercy on
[1:02:10] whomever he pleased. Right?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; He set one up and he take the other
[1:02:14] down. You can't tell God what to do.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Paul talk about it in a
[1:02:20] righteousness with God and all that.
[1:02:22] Right? Said, "Therefore 98, have he
[1:02:25] mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[1:02:27] whom he will he harden." God do what he
[1:02:30] want to do, don't he?
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I'm so glad, hallelujah.
[1:02:34] that God ain't like man, right?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; God don't got no respect to persons. Oh,
[1:02:38] that's my friend. That's my God. God
[1:02:40] don't do that. Hallelujah. But God go by
[1:02:43] predestination. I for know them in the
[1:02:46] mind of God. I don't care what everybody
[1:02:48] else saying about them. I don't care
[1:02:50] what everybody else thinking about them.
[1:02:51] They were in my mind. Hallelujah. And I
[1:02:54] know who they are. Hallelujah.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; I know my thoughts concerning you. Come
[1:02:58] on.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Everybody thinking bad, but I know you.
[1:03:00] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You don't even see yourself.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; As nothing, but I know who you are.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; And my spirit come to wake it up.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. God want to wake
[1:03:12] somebody up.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Shake something out. Lucen.
[1:03:17] Hallelujah. He went to Gideon and he
[1:03:19] woke him up, didn't he?
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Gideon hiding. Come on. Fear got a hold
[1:03:23] of him, right? Why? What are you hiding
[1:03:26] for, Gideon? Come on. Cuz every time God
[1:03:29] blesses, the devil take our blessings.
[1:03:31] Well, why you let them take your
[1:03:32] blessings for him?
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say you possess the gates of
[1:03:36] all of your enemies?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Aren't you a Hebrew? Aren't you a child
[1:03:39] of God?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. Where is your faith?
[1:03:42] Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "Thou mighty man of
[1:03:45] valor."
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Something woke up in Gideon, didn't it?
[1:03:49] Come on. That's what it is with with the
[1:03:50] preaching of the gospel. God send
[1:03:52] somebody your way.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It don't happen to me before. Somebody
[1:03:56] tear you all the way down, right? Or
[1:03:58] something happened. You look you look at
[1:04:00] yourself cuz somebody just told you you
[1:04:02] ain't nothing and they pointing out all
[1:04:03] of your faults, right? And you might I
[1:04:06] it happened to me. You start crying
[1:04:07] because all that truth, right? But then
[1:04:10] all of a sudden, God send a word by your
[1:04:12] way. Hallelujah. A word by your way to
[1:04:15] lift you up out of that, right? To lift
[1:04:17] up your head to say, "Hey, I'm a son.
[1:04:19] I'm a daughter of God. Hey, I don't have
[1:04:21] to stay here, right?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to return to the Lord. I'm
[1:04:25] going to go to God. Hallelujah. And God
[1:04:27] is merciful to forgive. Ain't he?
[1:04:28] Somebody give the Lord praise this
[1:04:30] morning. Come on. I said choosing faith
[1:04:33] over fear, right? You know, I had a got
[1:04:36] a whole lot. So, so choosing faith over
[1:04:38] fear, right? They chose
[1:04:41] they chose uh uh fear, didn't they? Come
[1:04:44] on. Imagine what that did. Wiped out all
[1:04:47] the things that God had done for them.
[1:04:50] Just that little talk clouded them.
[1:04:52] Clouded them so much. The way the Bible
[1:04:55] says they wept and cried all night. Come
[1:04:57] on. They went from when they saw the
[1:05:00] fruits, oh, rejoicing the fruits. But
[1:05:02] then that little bit of talk had wiped
[1:05:04] that all out. Right. Went went from one
[1:05:07] extreme to the next. From having joy,
[1:05:10] ready to take the land to now crying and
[1:05:13] weeping. He brought us out here to die
[1:05:15] where there are no graves in Egypt.
[1:05:16] Right? There's a turn crying and weeping
[1:05:18] all night long. Right? But the thing was
[1:05:21] you had two that was trying to say,
[1:05:24] "Hey, you know what? You know, don't do
[1:05:27] that to people." See, you listen to the
[1:05:29] wrong people, right?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; It might have been that, but we weren't
[1:05:33] even looking at that, right? In our
[1:05:35] eyes, we didn't see ourselves as
[1:05:37] grasshoppers.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; In our eyes, we saw that we was more
[1:05:40] than able.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; That's what we saw. Don't know what they
[1:05:45] saw. What we saw, we're well more than
[1:05:47] able.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. To take the land. Why? Because
[1:05:50] God gave it to us. One thing about it,
[1:05:53] come on. You know, we're not we're not
[1:05:56] going off of just something natural.
[1:05:58] Like I was looking at uh uh what I said
[1:06:00] is faith over fear. We ain't going off
[1:06:03] natural ability, right? Or human
[1:06:05] ability. But what are we looking for to
[1:06:07] overcome? By the word of God.
[1:06:09] Hallelujah. Say overcome by the blood of
[1:06:11] the lamb and the word of that testimony.
[1:06:13] We looking to overcome by what he's
[1:06:15] already did. Right? We're trusting to
[1:06:17] make it because God said we'll make it.
[1:06:19] Hallelujah. We trusting to be overcomers
[1:06:21] because God said we'll be overcomers.
[1:06:23] Not in our own human ability. If that's
[1:06:25] the case, we would have felt a long time
[1:06:27] ago. But what it is, I'm trusting in
[1:06:29] uncction from the holy one. Hallelujah.
[1:06:31] Come on. How many trusting in that
[1:06:33] uncction this morning? Oh God. I said
[1:06:35] you got to choose that though, right?
[1:06:37] Cuz it's put before you, ain't it? Ain't
[1:06:39] that's what it did. Drug them all the
[1:06:41] way down. But the two was trying to
[1:06:43] trying to uh uh I say get the people
[1:06:45] revived. But that's what it is. Come on.
[1:06:47] You got to deal. I I I says what you got
[1:06:49] to deal with fear, right? You got to
[1:06:52] deal with that first because fear the
[1:06:55] Bible talk about fear bring torment,
[1:06:56] right? Come on. It'll torment you, won't
[1:07:00] it? Come on. What's going down and say
[1:07:02] what's wrong with that person? What's
[1:07:04] wrong? You know, fear torment them,
[1:07:06] right? They say, "Oh, I'm all right."
[1:07:07] You know something wrong with them,
[1:07:08] right? Come on. They about where? Come
[1:07:12] on. Fear did that, done it.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Bring torment you. torment you where you
[1:07:16] can't sleep at night, torment you the
[1:07:18] way things were there, but it's there
[1:07:20] now because you brought it on yourself.
[1:07:22] The thing you feared came upon you,
[1:07:23] right?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; But what it is, you got to find a way,
[1:07:27] like I say, to shake yourself.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to change the people
[1:07:30] that you listening to. Sometimes you
[1:07:33] going to tell somebody about it. Like we
[1:07:34] say, you know, you going to tell Jesus
[1:07:36] about it, but you got to find your
[1:07:37] prayer partner. Hallelujah. Come on. And
[1:07:40] when you can't find nobody else, you got
[1:07:41] to do like David did and encourage
[1:07:43] yourself. Hallelujah. When everybody
[1:07:45] else want to encourage me, I encourage
[1:07:46] myself.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. Right.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; I stir myself up. I have revival all by
[1:07:53] myself.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. One thing about it, but you
[1:07:57] got to deal with it. Like I said, fear.
[1:07:59] Come on. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You got to deal
[1:08:01] with that. I like I was looking at some
[1:08:03] things. I said how David, he was in in
[1:08:05] Psalms, believe it 27, he was saying,
[1:08:07] "The the Lord is my light and my
[1:08:09] salvation. Whom shall I fear?" Come on.
[1:08:12] You got to take that real. You know one
[1:08:14] thing about it if the Lord if God before
[1:08:16] if God is fighting your if he is there
[1:08:18] who are you going to fear what going to
[1:08:20] stand before you come on he said the
[1:08:23] Lord is a strength to my life right whom
[1:08:25] shall I be afraid come on I ain't got to
[1:08:27] fear
[1:08:29] everybody else fearing what I got to
[1:08:30] fear for come on go out there and even
[1:08:34] saw all them in the tents fear got them
[1:08:36] right they can fight till they saw
[1:08:38] Goliath come out there right
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; he looked like too big of a trial too
[1:08:42] big of a storm too big of a test, right?
[1:08:45] Oh, Jesus. Bible said they were shaking,
[1:08:48] right? Talks all with him in the tents.
[1:08:50] But it's somebody that chose faith over
[1:08:52] fear. Hallelujah. Because he weren't
[1:08:54] looking at his what his present
[1:08:56] situation was.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. But he was trusting in the
[1:09:00] power of almighty God. Hallelujah. I
[1:09:02] might not be big enough, but what am I
[1:09:04] trusting in? The power of almighty God.
[1:09:07] I'm trusting in the promise of God. I'm
[1:09:09] trusting that God will bring me out.
[1:09:11] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. I don't know about
[1:09:14] you, but I'm trusting that this morning.
[1:09:15] Come on. But you got to deal with it,
[1:09:17] right? And one thing about it sometimes
[1:09:20] I like how you know here now in our
[1:09:22] scripture reading Jesus was saying when
[1:09:26] he went, you know, he's sitting there
[1:09:27] having revival meetings. Come on. And
[1:09:30] and having healings and somebody come
[1:09:31] tell him the pastor uh Levas Jerus tell
[1:09:34] him hey your daughter done died. So he
[1:09:36] immediately Jesus had to say get he said
[1:09:39] oh don't don't don't don't fear fear not
[1:09:41] right fear not come on don't let I know
[1:09:44] he just told you some bad news but fear
[1:09:47] not
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; shake yourself
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; come on you just heard bad news come on
[1:09:52] in my is shake yourself don't fear now
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; remember who's in control hallelujah
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; shake yourself
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; remember quit you like me remember who
[1:10:02] you are hallelujah
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; oh Jesus I can see them say Samson and
[1:10:06] the Philistines are upon you. He shook
[1:10:08] himself, right? As long as that locks
[1:10:10] were still there. Now, come on. He know
[1:10:13] who he was, didn't he? Know the promise
[1:10:15] that God made, the covenant he had with
[1:10:17] God, right?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. No matter how many of them out
[1:10:20] there, don't even matter. Hallelujah.
[1:10:22] Right?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I know that something
[1:10:25] supernatural getting ready to happen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. You know what I was
[1:10:29] looking at? I says a lot of times when
[1:10:31] adversity comes, right? When the squeeze
[1:10:34] come, you watch the supernatural show
[1:10:35] up. Hallelujah.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. When all odds is against you
[1:10:38] and the squeeze show up, I said that's
[1:10:40] when that's when the supernatural takes
[1:10:42] place. That's when the gifts show up.
[1:10:44] Right. That's when God shows up.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Why does he do it that way? Cuz no man
[1:10:49] ain't going to get no glory. When God
[1:10:51] get done with it, you'll know it was
[1:10:53] that God that done it. Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Won't be no doubt in your mind who done
[1:10:57] that. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And I thank
[1:10:59] God what it is. He wants to get all the
[1:11:01] glory, don't he?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; But what it is, you got to deal with it.
[1:11:05] Jesus had to deal with that, didn't he?
[1:11:07] Fear not. Come on. Don't let Come on.
[1:11:09] I'll go with you. Come on. Right.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; That's why when he went there, he only
[1:11:13] took a certain pe few people in the
[1:11:14] house with him. Right. So I said, "Why
[1:11:16] you didn't take me in?" Come on. I don't
[1:11:18] know. But he only called a couple people
[1:11:20] in there. Right.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Then when he got in there, he said,
[1:11:22] "Hey, everybody's weeping." He said,
[1:11:24] "Oh, she ain't dead. She's sleep." The
[1:11:27] Bible said they laughed him, didn't
[1:11:28] they? Amen.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; They just weeping and mourning and then
[1:11:31] they go, "Man, hallelujah.
[1:11:34] That done been working miracles, doing
[1:11:36] signs and wonders, right?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Coming to pray. Come to And y'all, they
[1:11:41] laughed the scorn, didn't they?"
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, Jesus put them
[1:11:45] all out, didn't he?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Get out of the house.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Can I say it like that?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; You don't want to believe, get out of
[1:11:52] here. Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Let God work.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; And when God work, you won't be laughing
[1:11:58] then. Hallelujah. But what it is, you'll
[1:12:00] see the power of God. You'll see the
[1:12:02] glory. You'll see the manifestation of
[1:12:04] the spirit. Hallelujah. And you won't
[1:12:06] laugh no more at it, will you? Come on.
[1:12:08] Then you'll be wanting Jesus to come by
[1:12:10] your house. Hallelujah. And work a
[1:12:11] miracle for you. That's what it ought to
[1:12:13] do.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; But what it is sometimes instead of
[1:12:19] doing that, it causes people to envy,
[1:12:21] right? He's doing it by all these
[1:12:25] things. But what it was, come on. fear.
[1:12:28] Don't fear. Get that away from you. Let
[1:12:30] God work in your life. How many want to
[1:12:32] do that this morning? Somebody give God
[1:12:34] praise. Amen. I says what it is. You got
[1:12:36] to fear. You got to choose that. Come
[1:12:38] on. I said you got to choose it, right?
[1:12:43] You got to choose faith, right? Cuz what
[1:12:46] it is, fear, as I said, something you
[1:12:48] got to deal with. And what it is, the
[1:12:50] devil put all those things for you,
[1:12:52] right? It's one thing about the devil.
[1:12:54] He knows that God going to do exactly
[1:12:56] what he said he going to do. He knows
[1:12:58] that that when God speaks all you got
[1:13:01] when you believe it that's it right. I
[1:13:03] says but what it is when you start uh uh
[1:13:05] uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh feeding into it.
[1:13:06] You know the prophet God was talking
[1:13:08] about Eve. He he says when he stopped
[1:13:10] even listening to her the devil right in
[1:13:13] her mind and that's what he does while
[1:13:15] you even entertaining it. Right. Stop uh
[1:13:18] and what happens? He walks right in your
[1:13:20] mind. Right. Get you all uh uh what it
[1:13:22] say? twist it all up. But one thing
[1:13:25] about it, come on, you got to be sold
[1:13:28] out, right?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because the devil, that's one
[1:13:31] thing. He He knows that God going to do
[1:13:33] what he says. And he knows that it's
[1:13:35] without faith, it's impossible to please
[1:13:37] God, right?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. Before you even come and ask
[1:13:40] anything, you got to first believe that
[1:13:42] he is.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; And he's a rewarder of them that
[1:13:44] diligently seek him. The devil know
[1:13:46] that, don't he? So his job is to keep
[1:13:48] you away, right?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes he'll tell you, "Oh,
[1:13:52] that's just the way it's going to be.
[1:13:53] That's just your lot." Did God tell you
[1:13:55] that?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. What did God say?
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, but you don't know. I I know one
[1:14:01] thing. I know what the word of God says.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. And I know one thing that he'll
[1:14:06] hold true to that. Hallelujah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; But the devil knows that he puts all
[1:14:10] kind of things before you, right?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; But come on. But you got a choice. What
[1:14:15] are you going to do? I don't know about
[1:14:17] you, but I said, "I'm going to believe
[1:14:19] God." Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Look at look at the world today. You
[1:14:22] can't have confidence in nothing out
[1:14:23] there.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's the truth.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Look at Oh, now we going to take do
[1:14:28] this. You don't know what's going to
[1:14:30] happen tomorrow.

[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Or will you be caught up in fear?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. If you trusting in anything
[1:14:39] else, you will be.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, when you
[1:14:43] realize, come on. These mountainies,
[1:14:46] Come on. Oh, hallelujah. Yeah. They're
[1:14:49] greater than I can face, but they ain't
[1:14:51] greater than the God I serve.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. Cuz the God I serve, he created
[1:14:55] all these things. He do what he want and
[1:14:58] what he will in the earth.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's we only the working of his
[1:15:02] power.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. And he brought me this far. I
[1:15:05] know he'll take me the rest of the way.

[1:15:27] life.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:15:34] God honored that, didn't he?

[1:15:39] bringing them food and all that. You got
[1:15:41] to eat it. Come on. And you don't turn

[1:17:52] morning." All the wise men, right? But

[1:18:04] that's when my God shows up. That's what
[1:18:06] he specializes in. Oh Jesus.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; So when the situation look hopeless,
[1:18:12] that's what my God specializes in.

[1:18:17] moment.

[1:19:00] that?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. But God showed him the dream.
[1:19:04] Daniel the dream interpreted. Oh, and
[1:19:06] when things seem impossible, but God
[1:19:08] specializes in that, don't he? Come on.
[1:19:11] So many times I was reading, looking at
[1:19:13] their little trials they were having.
[1:19:15] Come on.
[1:19:17] Oh, got made the image. We can go get in
[1:19:19] all that, but made the image and bow
[1:19:21] down and worship all that. But those
[1:19:23] Hebrew boys, come on. They purpose in
[1:19:25] their heart no matter what. Fire,
[1:19:27] furnace, no matter what. Right. Come on.

[1:19:41] one thing. My God is the consuming fire.
[1:19:43] Hallelujah.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.

[1:19:51] out of your life. Right. Come on. But
[1:19:53] when they looked at it, what they do?
[1:19:55] They began to say, "No fear grip them."
[1:19:57] Right. Come on. Well, we going to bring
[1:19:59] you before the king. Right. To see if
[1:20:01] you change your mind. See what it is.
[1:20:03] The devil trying to try you. Ain't it?
[1:20:04] Test you. Come on. Let me see if I can
[1:20:06] get them. Show them a little more and
[1:20:07] see what they do. One thing about it I
[1:20:09] says all you got to do is stay with the
[1:20:11] word. Hallelujah.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You know, I was sharing with the
[1:20:13] children the other day. I said, you know
[1:20:14] how you defeat the devil? Come on. It's
[1:20:17] written. Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to
[1:20:19] argue do all that debate. You just How
[1:20:21] did Jesus defeat the devil? With the
[1:20:23] word, didn't he?

[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Trial, it's written.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's written. Tribulation is
[1:20:42] written.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. It'll defeat the devil every
[1:20:45] time, won't it?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. Somebody got to
[1:20:49] believe that this morning.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. That the word to defeat the
[1:20:52] devil on any ground, any place.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because one thing about it, he
[1:20:57] going to back it up. Ain't it?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; But I find that it says that you know in
[1:21:01] the midst of them even with like I said
[1:21:02] in the fire and all that come bring they
[1:21:04] going to change their mind. But it's one
[1:21:06] thing I like how these boys says come
[1:21:07] on. Come on. Many people tremble even at
[1:21:10] the presence of King Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:21:12] Even the thought of him coming they
[1:21:14] tremble. Right now these boys got to
[1:21:16] stand before him and explain why they
[1:21:19] ain't bowing down to the image he set
[1:21:21] up. Come on. Why they ain't coming to do
[1:21:24] what he decreed. Right?
[1:21:27] But what they did, they chose faith,
[1:21:29] didn't they?
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; They began to tell Nebuchadnezzar even
[1:21:32] there, right? They says, "King, we're
[1:21:34] not careful to answer you on this
[1:21:36] matter.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; I ain't got to hold my tongue about it."
[1:21:38] Come on.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; I don't have to. Oh, come on. Don't
[1:21:41] Don't try to intimidate me. Right.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't try to intimid. He He
[1:21:46] said, It says we don't hold our tongue
[1:21:47] in this matter.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Says we know that our God is able.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; I'm choosing faith. Hallelujah.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did God tell you he was going to
[1:21:56] do it? No. But I know he's able.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. In their case, come on. In our
[1:22:01] case, God told us he'll do it, didn't
[1:22:02] he?
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Told us he'll provide. Come on. He told
[1:22:04] him to in a way, but I just said in that
[1:22:06] case, right?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He's able.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; King Oh, heated up seven times more.
[1:22:13] Right. Mad, right? But what it is?
[1:22:16] Faith. Faith overcame in that situation,
[1:22:19] didn't it?
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; They chose faith over fear. Walked in
[1:22:22] the fire, right? Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. But in the fire, God was in
[1:22:26] there with him, wasn't he? Coming out
[1:22:27] with a testimony, right?
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; That am I went sin or whatever they call
[1:22:34] it, I stood. I still stood.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; When I couldn't do nothing else, I still
[1:22:39] stood. Hallelujah. And God showed up. At
[1:22:42] that very moment where it looked like it
[1:22:44] would he wasn't going to do nothing, God
[1:22:46] stepped right in. Hallelujah. Right in
[1:22:49] the fire, he stepped in.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. So many time after time I says
[1:22:53] but what it is you know I was thinking I
[1:22:55] says I won't be long this morning I was
[1:22:56] thinking I says you know I was at years
[1:22:59] ago and I like I like revisiting
[1:23:02] testimonies right because it stirs you
[1:23:06] up right I says you know what it is I
[1:23:09] was thinking about those Hebrew boys and
[1:23:11] how they had to stand before
[1:23:12] Nebuchadnezzar and go in the fire he was
[1:23:13] saying hey you don't bow down they said
[1:23:15] we ain't careful off you right they was
[1:23:17] bold wasn't they but I says you know one
[1:23:19] I remember once they wanted me to were
[1:23:21] not sh so bad. I ain't long I've been
[1:23:23] saved maybe a year or so. I want you to
[1:23:25] work second shift, whatever. They would
[1:23:27] have took me out of all the church
[1:23:28] service during the week, right? That
[1:23:30] that time, you know, the Lord done did
[1:23:32] doing so much for you, you on fire. I
[1:23:34] said, "What it is?" The devil and they
[1:23:37] offering you money to go to the next
[1:23:38] shift, right? And the devil said, "Oh,
[1:23:40] that's a blessing right there." Come on.
[1:23:41] Everything you think ain't a blessing
[1:23:43] ain't a blessing sometimes.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; See, what I was looking at at was a
[1:23:46] blessing. That God done cleaned me up.
[1:23:49] Amen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; That God done brought me into the
[1:23:51] household of faith. That God is speaking
[1:23:53] to my soul. Hallelujah. That God is
[1:23:55] doing the miraculous in my life. I said
[1:23:57] God can do all things. Right.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; And I don't have to get out of his will
[1:24:01] to get it.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; You don't have to get out of God's will
[1:24:04] to get it.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; But you can choose to stay with God.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Right. What it is, the devil want you to
[1:24:11] get out there cuz he know you get out

[1:24:14] outside of his will.

[1:24:36] money, blah blah. I says, I begin to
[1:24:38] witness to him. I says, "You only know
[1:24:41] what God brought me from, what he did in
[1:24:44] my life, right? Come on." He says,
[1:24:47] "Well, what a why by
[1:24:49] this night, Tuesday night, Thursday
[1:24:51] night, you can't give up." I said, "One
[1:24:53] night, no." I said, "I got to Why you
[1:24:55] got to be there?" I said, "I got to be
[1:24:56] there."
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; I wasn't even preaching at the time. I
[1:24:59] said, "Got to be there." Cuz I was just
[1:25:01] so like it said, I was glad when they
[1:25:03] said unto me, "Let us go into the house
[1:25:05] of the Lord."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; People ain't glad no more, right?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. I remember especially when back
[1:25:11] in those days we used to come uh know
[1:25:13] brother Sam, brother Adrian all we used
[1:25:14] to come and church uh prayer service
[1:25:16] didn't start the the 6 at that time I
[1:25:19] think it was we get out here 5:00
[1:25:22] and then we started getting out here at
[1:25:24] 4:00
[1:25:26] that was before we was married
[1:25:29] I ain't saying that that's why we
[1:25:31] stopped but we we wasn't married then
[1:25:33] you you remember that over the other
[1:25:34] buildings but we we pull up I remember
[1:25:37] one time we pulled up to to the out
[1:25:40] there and and it was about 4:00. Brother
[1:25:42] Sam was driving that white van and
[1:25:44] brother Adrian driving a little red car
[1:25:45] at the time. We all pull up about the
[1:25:48] same time and we all jumped out the car
[1:25:50] and ran in the church. See who can get
[1:25:52] in there first to the altar. Come on. I
[1:25:56] was glad when they said unto me,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I came running when they said unto me,
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; did you run this morning? I ask people
[1:26:03] that all the time. Come on. But I says
[1:26:06] what it was. It was a joy to be down on
[1:26:08] your knees.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. We used to be over there in the
[1:26:11] side little building and playing tapes
[1:26:13] and listening, reading the Bible
[1:26:14] Saturday. It had nothing to do. Come out
[1:26:15] there. I mean, your whole life was built
[1:26:17] around the gospel.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. And God was doing things.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; He was working.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. And what it is you say is God
[1:26:26] God didn't slack up. Where are you?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's right here. Come on. God
[1:26:33] ain't slack concerning his promises.
[1:26:36] He's still there waiting on you.
[1:26:38] Hallelujah.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; To get on fire again. Come on.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; But I remember then I says you know at
[1:26:45] that time he asked me I want want you to
[1:26:47] come. They say as well and I I began to
[1:26:49] tell him then then here you go. Uh you
[1:26:52] know I was thinking just now I said how
[1:26:53] the devil told Jesus you the son of God
[1:26:55] turn these stones into bread. He said
[1:26:57] man shall not live by bread alone by
[1:26:59] every word. Right. Oh okay. He said if
[1:27:01] you okay put you up here. He said, "I
[1:27:04] give you all the kings of the world. You
[1:27:05] bow down and worship me." It's written.
[1:27:07] Come on. He has no other gods for me.
[1:27:09] Him only shall I serve. Right. Oh, the
[1:27:12] devil going to get religious after that.
[1:27:14] Ain't he? I'm going use the word against
[1:27:16] him. Right. Huh? I throw you down. Ain't
[1:27:18] it written? Come on. Not the devil
[1:27:20] quoting scriptures. Come on. He cast you
[1:27:23] down. A get angel charging you. That's
[1:27:25] you dash your foot against his tongue.
[1:27:26] Come on. But one thing about Jesus, he
[1:27:29] was the word. You can't tangle him up,
[1:27:31] right? Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; You can't tangle them up.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. You said thou shall not tell
[1:27:36] him the Lord thy God. Right? Rebuke
[1:27:38] them. The devil had to leave cuz he saw
[1:27:41] that no matter what, I can't get him off
[1:27:43] of that stance.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; And the devil will flee you too if you
[1:27:46] resist him.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; He will. He'll come try you, test you,
[1:27:51] but you resist the devil and watch he
[1:27:53] flee.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; You got to resist him.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Don't you? Hallelujah. But I remember
[1:28:00] telling me that say I says and he begin
[1:28:02] the the plant manager begin to say at
[1:28:03] the time he said earnest he say he says
[1:28:06] well God know you need this job
[1:28:10] he said God give you this job he know
[1:28:12] you need it you know pretty much said
[1:28:15] you don't think that you know and I told
[1:28:17] her at the time
[1:28:20] cuz I was bold back then wasn't married
[1:28:22] then either I don't think but I says hey
[1:28:26] I says God gave me this I he'll give me
[1:28:29] another one if it's his will.
[1:28:31] Hallelujah.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; And I felt that way.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Come what may. God bless me. He'll bless
[1:28:40] me again.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't try to intimidate me.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Right. It be spirits,
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; right? No matter what, I'mma stay with
[1:28:51] God.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; If I got to stand by myself, I'll stand
[1:28:56] with him. Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Done had it with all your friends,
[1:28:59] family, everybody walk away from you.
[1:29:01] But one thing about it, in that lonely
[1:29:03] hour, that's when I found Jesus.
[1:29:04] Hallelujah. In that lonely times,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; that's when I found out he was a friend
[1:29:09] like no other.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; You know, some people never had those
[1:29:13] moments.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. Never had that. They was too
[1:29:17] afraid to lose people, right? So they
[1:29:20] just like a reed shaking in the wind,
[1:29:22] right?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; The wind blow. They just Come on. But
[1:29:25] there's something about it. God don't
[1:29:26] want reeds shaking in the wind.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; He wants somebody called out.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; He want call you. He call you as an
[1:29:32] individual, right?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; He wants somebody that's going to say,
[1:29:35] "Yes, Lord. I believe you."
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I'll come if I got to come by myself.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; That sounds like a good song. People
[1:29:42] say, "I'll go if I got to go by myself."
[1:29:44] But when God call you,
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; he separates you
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; from friends. Sometimes he separates you
[1:29:51] from your wife or your husband. call
[1:29:53] you,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; walk before me. Hallelujah. And be thou
[1:29:58] perfect.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; And watch the stand you take some time
[1:30:02] to save your significant other. Come on.
[1:30:04] But you got to be real, right? But I
[1:30:06] remember in that whole situation and I
[1:30:08] says what it is faith choosing faith
[1:30:11] over fear. And I walked out walking out
[1:30:14] the room the office and the plant
[1:30:16] manager and the superintendent said,
[1:30:17] "Hey man, come back in here." So I
[1:30:19] walked in there. They said, "Hey, what
[1:30:22] times you go to church?" And I told them
[1:30:25] and they said, "We really need you to
[1:30:26] work this other shift." They said, "So
[1:30:29] on the time those days, they said they
[1:30:31] give me enough time to clock out that I
[1:30:33] can go to church." I mean, give me
[1:30:35] enough time to go to church and come
[1:30:37] back to work. Give me a certain period
[1:30:38] of time on those days that I can go,
[1:30:40] right? And then I get leave out again.
[1:30:42] He said, "Hold up. Close the door." It
[1:30:44] says, "Uh, before they said, when you
[1:30:47] leave, don't worry about clocking out.
[1:30:49] We're going to pay you to go to church.
[1:30:50] Come on. What it was? That's the truth.
[1:30:53] Very, you remember that? That was the
[1:30:55] truth. Never miss a service here.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm going to condemn myself here.
[1:31:02] Early praying, too. Come on.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; They had the time in to get there early
[1:31:07] to pray,
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; right? Cuz what it was, come on. You
[1:31:11] choosing, you ain't making no excuses,
[1:31:14] right?
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; I'm choosing faith over fear, right?
[1:31:18] Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. There's so many angles I wanted
[1:31:20] to go with this, right? But I say it's
[1:31:22] what it is. Come on. It's so many so
[1:31:24] many things, right? With fear,
[1:31:26] especially with sicknesses. Come on.
[1:31:28] Especially with sickness.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Because everybody going to give you a
[1:31:32] testimony against what the word of God
[1:31:33] say.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't but a few going to tell you to
[1:31:37] look up, right?
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. Even you go to the doctor, you
[1:31:41] get the report from him, right? But one
[1:31:43] thing about it is God is going to be the
[1:31:44] only healer.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in those circumstances,
[1:31:48] you know, you do what you got to do. But
[1:31:50] one thing about it, you know, I know one
[1:31:52] thing, God is the only healer.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. In all, if if the work get
[1:31:57] done, God going to do it.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; If God don't build keep the city, it
[1:32:00] ain't going to get kept.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. If God don't do it or man
[1:32:04] build, whatever, it'll get fall down. It
[1:32:06] ain't going to be no good. Right? But
[1:32:07] what God does is perfect. How many
[1:32:09] believe that this morning? Come on. But
[1:32:10] you got an opportunity, right, to
[1:32:13] choose.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Faith. what you going to do? so
[1:32:17] many uh uh examples in the scriptures
[1:32:19] and that's why Paul I took too long but
[1:32:22] I want to really go there and break down
[1:32:23] in in Romans 8 how he was saying in in
[1:32:26] Nate let let's can we read that Romans 8
[1:32:28] and28 I know I'm winning along I don't
[1:32:31] really go long Romans 8 and 28 I think
[1:32:34] it is
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; nay in all things
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting on it who got it
[1:32:41] y'all forgive me say we know that all
[1:32:44] things work together for the good of
[1:32:45] them that love God to them who are
[1:32:47] called according to his purpose.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Says, "For whom he did forno, he did
[1:32:53] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:32:55] image of his son, that he might be the
[1:32:57] firstborn among many brethren."
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Moreever, whom he did predestinate, them
[1:33:02] he also called, he called, he justified.
[1:33:05] And whom he justified, them he also
[1:33:07] glorified. Who what shall we say then to
[1:33:10] these things? If God be for us, who can
[1:33:12] be against us? You know, one thing about
[1:33:15] it, God, you go to the next verse,
[1:33:17] right? You know, one thing about it,
[1:33:19] God, God did the work. That's why he's
[1:33:20] laying that that foundation there. You
[1:33:22] know, it's God that done it. God, he
[1:33:24] already called, justified your glory.
[1:33:26] All he says, and we saying, who what
[1:33:29] shall we say in these things? If God be
[1:33:30] for us, come on. Who can be against? Say
[1:33:32] he separated us from not of his own son,
[1:33:35] but delivered him up for us all. How
[1:33:38] shall he not how shall he not with him
[1:33:41] also freely give us all things? says,
[1:33:43] "Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:33:47] God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
[1:33:50] Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[1:33:52] that die, yay, rather that risen again,
[1:33:54] who is even at the right hand of God,
[1:33:57] who also maketh intercession for us. Who
[1:34:00] shall separate us from the love of
[1:34:02] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:34:06] persecution, famine, nakedness, peril,
[1:34:09] swore?" says, "As it is written, for thy
[1:34:12] sake we are killed all the day long. We
[1:34:15] are accounted as sheep for the
[1:34:16] slaughter." Nay, in all these things.
[1:34:20] Come on. Come on. Somebody is saying all
[1:34:23] these things.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; All these things.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. You got to choose faith over
[1:34:26] fear. He didn't say you wouldn't have
[1:34:28] trials.
[1:34:30] Paul talked about them. Persecution,
[1:34:32] peril, sword. Oh, no. He talking about
[1:34:34] we killed all day long. It's written.
[1:34:36] Come on. He didn't talk about you
[1:34:37] wouldn't have adversities, right?
[1:34:40] But one thing about it, he's letting you
[1:34:42] know. Come on, those things come. Don't
[1:34:45] have fear, right?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. He said in all these
[1:34:48] things, we are what?
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. We just conquerors.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; We more than, right?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Not just conqueror, we more. Like they
[1:34:57] said, we more than able. We more. Halle
[1:34:59] Hallelujah. How are we more? Because God
[1:35:01] is fighting our battles.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Because God is out in the forefront. It
[1:35:05] ain't us, but it's him. Hallelujah. We
[1:35:07] more than conquerors, right? Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Through who? Through him
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; that loved us.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said it's Christ that
[1:35:15] died rather than rise again. It's him
[1:35:17] that's making intercession for us.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I believe in one place he was talk
[1:35:23] talking about. Come on. I fought a good
[1:35:25] fight. I finished the course. Right. I
[1:35:28] kept the faith. Come on.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Had trials but I kept the faith.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Right. People walked away from you.
[1:35:35] Talked about you. Had storms, wind
[1:35:37] blowing. Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; My hardest times, right?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Felt like giving up, but I kept it,
[1:35:44] right?
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many feel like keeping
[1:35:47] it this morning?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. But what it is, I said, you got
[1:35:50] to choose faith.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. You got to choose it. Remember
[1:35:54] that. You got to choose it over fear.
[1:35:56] Hallelujah.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:36:09] I thought a slaughter of the song I just
[1:36:11] wrote in my head. I'm excited.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I'm excited about this Christian war.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; I'm excited about this journey.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. There got to be a people
[1:36:25] that's excited.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you see what folks cannot
[1:36:30] see.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; You believe what they cannot believe.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that that the God that
[1:36:37] you serve is real. And I'm excited about
[1:36:40] this journey. I'm excited because the
[1:36:43] Lord is soon to come.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; I'm excited because heaven
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; is my home.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I started off.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I know I'm excited about
[1:36:55] it.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you get excited when you
[1:36:58] begin to see the glory of the Lord.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you see what God has done for
[1:37:03] you, it makes you excited.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; It makes you happy.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Happy to know that I'm saved. Happy to
[1:37:12] know that God has delivered me. Amen.
[1:37:15] And open my blind eyes. I'm happy. I'm
[1:37:18] excited.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; I got something to be excited about.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're not excited, then I
[1:37:30] don't know what you're looking at. If
[1:37:33] you're looking at this world and you're
[1:37:34] looking at the cares of this life, amen,
[1:37:37] then you'll be sad. But if you're
[1:37:39] looking at Jesus, it makes you happy.
[1:37:42] Amen. I'm looking at all the blessings
[1:37:44] that is in store for them to love him.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. And I got
[1:37:51] something to be excited about, something

[1:39:19] the word that has been preached this

[1:40:28] can you believe and receive,
[1:40:32] Amen, that God wants you to make a
[1:40:35] choice.
[1:40:39] Faith over fear. faith that God promised
[1:40:44] that I never leave you. I never forsake
[1:40:46] you.
[1:40:48] That it's not anything too hard for God
[1:40:50] to do.
[1:40:52] If you're not saved this morning, why
[1:40:54] don't you make that decision? You got a
[1:40:57] choice to make.
[1:40:59] Faith over fear. I don't know what's
[1:41:02] holding you and what's got you bound,
[1:41:07] but if you make that right decision, I
[1:41:09] want to choose faith. I want to choose
[1:41:12] Jesus.
[1:41:14] If our heads are bow, is there one that
[1:41:16] want to give your heart to Jesus? Thank
[1:41:18] you. Is there another one? Thank you.
[1:41:22] Lord, come into my life.
[1:41:25] Father, you see the hands that lifted
[1:41:27] up, the hearts are open.

[1:41:32] of your spirit come

[1:41:37] and father fill me with your spirit.

[1:41:43] come down. Liberate my soul Lord.

[1:41:50] Move in life. Father have your way Lord.
[1:41:54] I surrender to you.

[1:42:06] chose faith?
