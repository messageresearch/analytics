the worship of our brother gordon and musicians and singers appreciate all of you that have come for he said when two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be in the midst thank the lord that he said forsake not assembling yourself together it's all about coming together amen because god amen has a blessing in his word we know that god's will in his is his word in his word amen god promised to meet us when we come together so i thank you for coming together and those that are not able to be here but lord they're absent in the body but present in the spirit we thank you for being with us over the airways romans 12 and 1 it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body is a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your reasonable service be not conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good acceptable perfect will of god this morning we want to talk about a new mind just praying this morning and said lord what would you have us to say and uh we looked at the world today in the condition of the mind set up mankind and really know that man mind has deteriorated and when we think of the mind we think of the mental condition of mankind and the spiritual condition of mankind i said god saw the need that he put it in romans that we be not conformed to this world but that we be transformed by the renewing of our minds i believe that in the beginning when god created man in his own image in his own likeness the man mine was a holy man god man man and man was so much like god he was able to name the animals he had a mind just like god's mind but i want you to know that somehow lucifer when he was in heaven according to isaiah 14 lucifer being in heaven had his own mind he wanted to take over heaven the bible says that in isaiah 14 that in 12 he said have thou fallen from heaven all lucifer son of the mourning how are thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation for thou has said in thy heart i will send into heaven and i will exalt my throne above the stars of god and i will set also in the mountain of the congregation in the sides of the north satan thoughts amen was to take over god's throne and i believe that satan because he could not conquer in heaven that he came to the earth if we are not count for the day we'll be caught up with satan the eden that god created was a holy eden the man the god created was a holy man but satan had a desire in his heart lucifer wanted he meant man to worship him the bible tells us in matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and oneness and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very lake there is an enemy on the prowl the devil is after your mind the steel the mind if he has your mind he can get you to do his desires and his will and to worship him the bible tells us lucifer was not successful in heaven and because of his not being successful in heaven he brought it into the garden of eden where mankind was innocent we call it the dispersation of innocence and in the dispersation of innocent man did not know the bible said man wasn't conscious of lust and he was not conscious of that he was naked because god had veiled him with a holy veil and man did not know he was naked but i want you to know in the period of innocence satan amen want to disturb god's holiness satan amen had a desire to creep in the bible said it was the possible he'll deceive even the very elect satan have a desire to receive mankind he deceived eve in the beginning and he's seeking the disease amen every one that lives on the face of the earth that calls all small and great rich and poor to wash up the beast and receive his mark amen his desire even mankind to turn to him but god you and i a new mind that mind only comes through the baptism of the holy ghost without the holy ghost amen your mind would be corrupt ii thessalonians 2 and 4 it tells us satan desire he tells us in three verse three let no man deceive you amen by any means for that day should not come accept the come of fallen away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of prediction judas was the son of perdition there is a man that's on the way coming but they are the spirit that's in the world today and that spirit is to get you ready for the man that's coming the man of sin he sent forth his demon powers of deception to catch the minds of the people that don't believe god's word and to corrupt their minds he's not only doing it through drugs and violence and lust but he also has a mind to take over where god's throne is he wants god's throne say to those amen he wants to work with your head that he can get to your heart his whole motive and objective is amen if i can get your mind i'm gonna get you hard and i'm gonna cause your soul to be lost are you with me so here he says who opposes and exalt himself above all that is called god uh that is worship so that he as god set it in the temple of god the bible tells us your body is the temper of the holy ghost satan wants to take the holy ghost's place satan want to take over amen god's house and he wants to be the one that's worshipped you following me satan won't worship but how is he god do it he creates into the church with his programs his money schemes he looks like he's helping you but all the time is a deceptive plan does enough good that he can creep in and make you think that he's all right that's what man looks at good works and because of good works the man does do he think that because of my works i'm saved but if we said last week we'll save by grace through faith and not of works least any man shall boast it doesn't matter how much work you do for the lord salvation is of the lord amen god is the only savior and without jesus coming to get us out of our central condition i said the reason he died is before your sins and for my sins jesus laid down his life that he could give you his life he made himself sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him so i'm going to say my brothers and sisters amen be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind you need the mind of christ we need the holy ghost we need the power of god to transform our minds so satan wants to take over the temple he wants to be in the temple satan wants your heart brother sister satan won't say amen if he can get in there amen and get your heart and your desires amen to be sent for he wants amen to blind you showing himself that he is gone people have been blind by doing good works being religious helping the pope amen doing a little thing nothing wrong with it we ought to do that amen we are to help in the community but salvation is not based upon what we do salvation is based upon jesus blood and his blood alone it's what he died to purchase the church with his own blood salvation comes only through jesus christ brother sister you got to look at what jesus has done for you and you got to believe that he died to set my soul free that i can have a new mind my thinking is off amen i can't justify myself amen all our righteousness this filthy rise that is in me pulse in me that is in my flesh it was no good thing i ain't no good you are no good the only one that's good is god and we need god in order for god to justify us to sacrifice oh yes we need god in the temple say your body is the temple of the holy ghost we need the holy ghost i want to get a little farther up the road satan is sitting in the church people walking themselves we might use the phrase they're working themselves to death churches are getting bigger they're raising more money than ever they met the preachers they meant their driving the bless they're living in the best neighborhoods they have jet planes people are doing swell the church look like in that day they men are very prosperous and unsuccessful i want you to know amen man looks on the outward appearance but god judges the heart god saw david the people wanted us all but god saw man that was at his own heart he wasn't much to look at but god saw in david not his outward appearance but god saw a man amen after his own heart a man amen that would obey god are you with me we need somebody amen are not caught up with the art with the parents we want to go to a beautiful building we want to have a mental elegant speaker somebody that's got a dd the old bishop used to call it a dead dog degree but i want to tell you amen we need somebody and that it doesn't matter whether they know the abc's whether whether or not they know jesus whether or not they meant they're baptized with the holy ghost whether or not the power of god is in the inside whether or not they're living according to the word we need god back in his temple we need god back in his people we need god on the inside brother sister we need to pray until god could come in his temple we need to pray that god can control and have preeminence in his temple let god come into your life and let it fill the temple with his holiness and his righteousness we need to repent of our sins and recognize that what we think of ourselves doesn't matter is what the word says that matters the most every man thinks himself amen the bible said as a weed that seemed right to a man amen but that's not god's way he said your thoughts are not my thoughts and your ways are not my way i want you to know that god has a way god wants you amen to be filled with his spirit god wants us to come in to your heart god wants you he meant to accept jesus as your lord and as your savior not just withheld knowledge not with intellectual conception but god wants you to do it amen from the heart oh yes brother sister church won't do johnny church won't do you need the holy ghost of being a member of a church it won't do you need to repent and say god i need you in my life the bible says be not conformed to this world so the bible said all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh amen the lusts of the eyes and the pride of life these things are not of the father without the world god calling us to get away from our love veil and be veiled with the holy ghost fear god wants to take the scales from our eyes i just said in second corinthians 4 there is a power that's sweeping the head that calls the man eyes to be blind not only are the eyes blind but satan has tapped with the ability amen to comprehend the things of god amen made them feel like everything is all right but down in the soul death is sitting there that's a worm of unbelief down in the soul of man it meant satan is there and satan needs to be rooted out of our lives we need amen to get to the root of the matter get down deep amen where you can get yourself out of the way amen because you don't think like god i don't care how intelligent you are amen you're not god amen you can't think like god you can't be like god even only god can identify himself by his own characteristics you can't love like god amen you can't live like god but you got to let god live in you until god karma in his holy temple and take control of your life you'll never be able to live right you'll never be able to talk right or you would me i want to say you can't think right your thinking is off your thinking is off you need a new mind folks are gone and they've gotten face to live folk they've gotten new knew this and knew that amen but you need a new mind and without that new mind you're in bad shape i'm in bad shape but god wants to give you a new mind amen the only way the doctors can't do it the psychiatrist can't do it the neurologists can't do it amen the plastic surgeons can't do it they can make it look good on the outside but the inside amen they can't fix the inside they can tall a little bit amen and get you away from things that trying to destroy you and psychology and philosophy amen won't work you need to let god come in and give you perfect peace whose mind is stand on him god wants to help you but while you're willing to come to god and let god fix it for you let me say this he said in the third verse of second corinthians but if our gospel would be it's here to them that are lost some people don't understand that the gospel is healed from them but because they're lost go to church yes preach in the pulpit yes but if our gospel will be heard it's here to them that allows the bible says whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of them that believe not least the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god to shine to them are y'all with me for we preach not ourselves amen but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light the shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ jesus christ today the bible says in revelation in my conclusion this morning i said man was innocent in the beginning in the end innocent covet with the holy veil covered by the holy spirit did not know he was naked but in the end in revelation as we conclude today revelation 3 tells us in 17 because thou says i'm rich i'm increased with good i have neither nothing nor is not the die of wretch miserable poor blind and naked north not mandate does not know i believe john was writing to the church the rich church the church that was in a condition that would call spiritual blindness spiritually naked naturally rich naturally they have achieved leaps and bounds prosper naturally but spiritually they were bereaved they had put jesus on the outside of the door of the church he was knocking on the door of the church couldn't get in because the church has grown prosperous the people that were going to the church was the upper class in the best of the city the poor and the knee was despised and rejected perhaps they would give them a crumb here and there what hill church has been successful to the outside view but the inside they were naked the less veil has taken over as it is taken over the streets of columbia taking over the streets of america left is everywhere people are naked and the thing is they don't know it because there is a lust veil that have coveted them satan has created his own eating and his it has eaten that an eaten that is full of lust and fleshly desires people are continuing on pleasing their own flesh cleaving their own self but jesus said let the spine be in you that was also in christ who being in the form of god thought it not rivalry to be equal with god but made of himself a new reputation the mind of god jesus had a mind to do the will of god jesus had a mind to please god i want you to know that your mind and your will and your desire ought to be i want to please you jesus lord not my will but i want your will to be done in my life i wonder jesus amen will to be done in my life how many have successfully pleased the church please the preacher would not please god i said we need a holy ghost meal we need the power of god again we need to see god in his temple we need to see the demonstration amen where the sickle heal why the blind see amen where am i the crippled walk where the power of god is in management station
