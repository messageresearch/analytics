preaching in suer on Wednesday at 7 the Lord's willing father let you know amen give give up your sins and let him in that ought to be my subject okay uh Matthew 24 it says and three and as he sat upon the mountain of ol of the disciples came unto him prively or privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world may God bless you read this word you may be seated I said if if it's any time that is the approprate time to talk about the end of the world when you look at what's going on over in Haiti and what's going on on in Israel and uh Ukraine and around the world seem as though people have gone mad and there's no safe place I believe that they said years and years ago that it was 1 minute to midnight and if it was I mean three minutes to midnight and if it's been three minutes to midnight then I think we're closer now than we ever been since the world began the end of the world are we there how many of you think we're at the end somebody say not me don't let it be because I ain't ready to go nowhere so y'all hold up we can't God has a time now and when God's on time here come as we read in Acts one we're at the end of the world I was going to go and read further in Matthew but acts one and seven it says we were dealing with the double portion we need a double portion to get out of here we need not just oil in our lamps but we need oil in our vessel we need more than just coming to church just saying I believe we need a double portion we need a double portion of God's anointing his spirit they had they became drunk they were so full of the spirit to they couldn't even walk right and people thought they were full of new wine I I think we needed a stagger drunken experience we need to get drunk so many times people have come to church and they could out get out I mean they just were so full of the spirit till they just couldn't howly walk they couldn't drive back home and all of that when the last time you seen the good Holy Ghost meeting where the people couldn't even drive back home it was so full of spirit and tears you know one of the first things I saw when the individuals receive the Holy Ghost all the days and I was back in Progressive and we prayed with people for the Holy Ghost I their first response when they received the Holy Ghost All Through the Ages I can go back over 50 years or more and people that receive the Holy Ghost one of the first things they did just think about it just think about what you think they did the first thing they did when they received the Holy Ghost I see my daddy seen different ones come in and we pray with them and I seen God just filling with his Spirit power of God all I wonder what you do when you receive it people that I've seen they cry with joy tears of joy you could see the tears coming down from their eyes with so much joy you know you said Brothers Don't Hug the sisters and all of that because we don't do that here one of the first things was a brother brother or a sister they begin to hug everybody just C hugging everybody I love you I love you love you I love you I love you I love you this I mean just the love of God just come all over they just love everybody just love everybody it's just full of the love of God they feel that presence that love and they just just this love everybody I see him walk around just crying and loving everybody now people seem as though they say well I receed the Holy Ghost the Bible says the Holy Ghost is the love of God sheded abroad in our hearts you become so in love with God and you just if you had any enemies you wouldn't even know it because there so much love in you you just love everybody I believe we need another experience where we love everybody you can love your enemies then because it's just God just God just the glory to God all over you another thing when you receive the Holy Ghost somebody says you don't even want to kill an ant you don't want to kill a musquito yeah I mean you just I I mean it's just it's just a wonderful experience if you have a received that experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's so wonderful it's so so powerful you feel uh somewhat Invincible you know I wanted to go out and lay hands on people and see the Miracles and signs I I experien something that real I wanted toest it God you know God is so good to me so real to me I know I had a life changing an experience I know something I I knew I was changed I I knew I knew I had what I asked God for walked out the door and look like I was in a new world the world had changed it was so bright outside I said everything is just different in other words my eyes have become open to the love of God I was at peace being so young so in love with God and having that experience that's an experience that I never wanted to lose and I I haven't lost it yet somebody said I love him more now as life is progressed I love him more because he said I'll never what I'll never leave you neither will I what forsake you a god that is has emptied himself or poured himself into you he's become so real to you everywhere you go he's with you he's in you everything you do sometimes you get a little grieved because sometimes look like we get a little Amnesia we don't know you know why we respond and do the things is because we are not in a consecrated in a prayer mood he's with us but we always got to recognize his presence we got to recognize when the Holy Spirit has lifted off us recognize when his presence is gone and recognize how much more we want his presence by so that takes repentance that takes confession it takes God I want you back in my life I need your presence back do you experience it every now and then maybe I get busy doing things going and oh worldly business and things that you have to take care of life and sometimes you're so busy you just pray a little bit a little while and jump back up and then things are you know you're back in then all of a sudden you say oh goodness his presence is not here like it ought to be got on my knees this morning early when I got out here I started praying and you know the presence come his presence is here I to consecrate the place since the builders were in here I Lord let the Holy Ghost move let the power of God be here for the service this morning I want to see you move let the place catch a fire amen so you get your expectations of you begin to create an atmosphere for you what you want God to do you as individuals got to create an atmosphere for what you want God to do in your life you know you can't get it until you want it you might need it but you can't get it till you want it we have needs in our lives but we can't get our needs fulfill until you want it bad enough as I was saying on Tuesday night a young lady said she'll be here this morning she's not here she said she got a lot going on I says she said I like smok my weed she said oh I really enjoy smoking weed said I love my weed now I said that weed gonna send you to hell you know I said but I said you love the devil that's who you love when you're talking to somebody in the street you can talk hard to them it don't they they're not offended at all I said she said I love my that's a that I hope she don't come in here while I'm talking I said you you going to go straight to hell with that weed I said that's what you're doing you preparing yourself to go to hell she said what I said yeah you preparing yourself to go to hell everybody go to hell they prepare themselves you getting ready for it I was telling about some things I ain't going to say this morning I told him on Tuesday but I ain't going to tell I mean that was Tuesday I think Friday that was Friday okay I ain't going to say tonight we got the camera on I mean this morning but you prepare yourself for where you want to go you want to go to heaven you start getting ready to go there you want to go to hell you start acting like it looking like it talking like it walking like it because that where you want to go are you with me but if you want to go to heaven you start preparing yourself to go there start talking like it walking like it living like it you want to go to heaven how many want to go to heaven everybody anybody want to go to hell nobody a nobody in here want nobody want to be lost I don't want to burn how about you no you to stop fighting okay okay I want to go to heaven how about you I want to go to heaven amen everybody want to go to heaven that's why we come to church right I'm coming cuz you know my mom will makeing me come my daddy making me come I'm coming you know I want to go to heaven I really want to go to heaven but we struggle right we battling we struggling want to go to heaven but I have a battle I have a struggle is anybody in here don't have battles struggles we all want to go to heaven but is anybody in here I know I have battles I have things I have to confront fight amen I have Devils that try to bring me down but I have to keep fighting a good fight this it's a struggle it's a battle but who's winning you know they said the black dog or the white dog I said the good or the evil which one is prevailing in your life the one that's Prevail is the one that you yield yourself to if you want God to be the win of the good to overcome the evil then you have to H ask for it you have to strive you have to fight you have to yield you know when you serving the devil it's hard to praise the lord it's hard to tell God I love you I thank you I praise you it's difficult you have such a it's such a thing that I ain't I ain't I ain't going to lie if I ain't serving the lord like I should I ain't going to tell no lie ain't no use to nobody tell me to raise my hand I ain't raising no hand cuz I know I ain't right but when you love the Lord and you know you're loving down deep in your heart something inside of you ought to make you lift your hand anyhow God cuz I want to be right I may not be right but I want to be right so I'm I'm going to lift my hand and say Lord I love you anyhow I'm going to tell you what once you start making a positive confession you know what happens things begin to change the devil get upset with you he get so mad you ain't nothing but a hypocrite thank you devil cuz I know you're a lie anyhow I'm not a hypocrite I really love the Lord there's a many people that really care and really love God but yet in their love for God they find themselves not able to live the kind of life that God asked them to live now though they love him though they willing and want to serve him yet they have things and obstacles and things in their way to keep them from doing what they want to do you always going to be challenged no matter what you're trying to achieve in life there's going to be a challenge that's going to be something you got to do that you got to put effort and you got to you know anything in life takes effort if you want to live right you got to fight to do it you got to strive you know what the best thing the help you can get get R people that do right live right you get R people people that live wrong and do wrong you know what happens when you around people that live wrong do wrong the Bible say evil commun communication what birds of a feather can two walk together SE are you with me but when you get around people that's strong and living for God and want want the will of God and the perfect will of God in their lives you get around those type of people it'll rub off on you now you get around somebody smoking a Jun you tell me I don't smoke no Jun but you get a a high by just being around a minute you ain't you didn't take no smoke I told you about the time brother Ernest said I'm we got there trying to witness to the fell and they smoking J and all of a sudden I'm I'm all dizzy he said I told you to get around there that's some strong stuff they got I said oh boy back in our day we Ain had nothing that strong that you standing on from a distance and they got you stagging and I said Lord have mercy and you see what I'm saying uh you get around the wrong crowd they have you know the Bible said the angels of the Lord encamp round about them they fear him right now who you think can C about them that don't fear it's Angels but it's Fallen Angels it's demon Spirits it's all kind of demon spirits around people that do evil stuff and they had being influenced not from above but from beneath and those demons are trying to tell them to do the wrong stuff so the the Dark World the th th those those demons are saying hey why don't you do this hey do do that why they influenc you've been influenced From Another World from the world that's beneath or the world that's from above [Music] Heaven is above hell is what below are you with me and you've been influenced from Heaven said all good and perfect gifts come from what above but the demons amen they come out of the pits of hell are you with me and they come to influence you because they know they got a short time are you with me they know their end is coming shortly are you with me so they doing everything to do when you come to church they hate you when you serve God they hate you and when you become one of them they they still hate you why because they know at any time you might start back serving God are you with me you cannot go in the world as a child of God and the world tell you hey man you one of us the world almost identifies you immediately tell you you ain't you ain't one of us are you with me they know it but sometime we try to fit in and try to be a part of what they are but the world say you ain't you ain't one of us you don't belong with us when I used to when I wasn't save fellow came from the church and he could sing like an angel but he sanging Blues well he can sing better than the man that made the song I said man we said man you don't blong with us you better go on back to church he said people in church ain't right I said man but you need to go to church are you with me so the people that tell you you don't belong out here this world is not our home we don't belong we don't belong here we're p and strangers we just traveling through here we're getting getting ready to go home we we want to go to heaven we want to go where Jesus is this world don't blow the Bible said don't love the world neither the things are in the world you don't belong here so what happens our time here we spend our time serving the lord getting ready to go to our Heavenly home we spent our time here getting prepared to go home we're only here for a short time our home is Eternal We'll never have to cry no more never have to be in pain no more no more sadness no more sorrow but we'll be home not worried about the demons and the devils and somebody shooting somebody killing somebody uh uh need never need a doctor never need a lawyer you never need a friend but we have somebody that's going to be with us always I wonder how it feels it must have feel somewhat like you when you experience the holy ghost power and you're in heaven and all the glory of God if everybody in here could just just say oh Lord let me just love everybody just let me experience that love that that the kind of love Jesus had for us God let me experience that love can I feel it can I experience it can I have that kind of love Lord I I you know I don't want no you know fleshly type love I want the love of God can I experience it because just think the atmosphere of Heaven it it would be Sublime the prophet said beyond the curtain of time he said you know I cannot I cannot describe it the kind of love that was beyond that if we step over in that other dimension and see we tasted when we get the Holy Ghost we're tasted of that love we're tasted of that joy we tasted of that other world the place where we're gone we tasted that and we won't give you can give me a a 10 billion dollars a trillion dollars I I wouldn't I wouldn't trade what I've tasted for that because it's not nothing in this world can compare to the love that God gives to them that would just only say Lord I accept it I receive it I want it amen I want that kind of love God I I I want your oh God I need peace I sometimes I'm I'm just tossing and turning in life sometimes I just I I get confused I get tangled up I get messed up I I I get troubl Lord but I want that kind of peace I know you said I send you another comforter but Lord I need that confident and that full assurance that I'm on the right I I'm on the right Trail I I'm going in the right direction Lord I need that kind of Peace God I need it hallelujah oh once you get that amen nothing else in this world matters nothing else in this life matters why because I got something that's real you know I I I don't need no alcohol I don't need a joint I don't need none of that stuff I know that I got something something that satisfies as Caleb said the satisfying potion I got Jesus I I I got something that's real I got something that would sustain me I got something that I know is there I know he's I know he's real I'm not I mean there's no question in my mind once there some doubt and some questions amen then you have not amen receive the answer but once you receive the answer there's no more question there's no more uh I don't know you have a positive experience you have a true experience with God almighty praise God there may be some amen things that amen you might question but you don't have to question God you don't have to uh think about whether or not imen this is uh uh the best thing for me this is this is uh the best thing for my life oh this is the way I want to live this is the way I want to conduct my life I want to conduct it in a way that God I want to please you amen hallelujah because you've done so much for me Hallelujah you know it it it's good to have protection amen when you got protection you feel secure when when we got Angels that's surrounding and Camp about us we got security amen we got somebody that watching over us watch somebody that's keeping us and I thank God for his keeping power I was going to get in my subject but that's it morning just wanted to talk to you about him and his love but you got to want the love of God experience the love of God I want want to help you to make up in your mind that I want that I want I want to experience I want a real TR Born Again experience I want something to sustain me in the fam the well that would never run dry the water that causes me not to thirst anymore the love that nobody nothing and nobody can give to me but Jesus I want that I don't want to leave here without experiencing that peace that Joy I want that I want God let us stand as we bow our heads we look to Jesus Jesus what a time that we're living in the world is definitely falling apart the tornadoes hidden earthquakes hdden floods and walls and rumors of walls so much going on God said that our Redemption draw it n i wonder this morning will you lift I will lift my eyes to the heels from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From the Lord that made the heavens and
