[1:02:49] yvonne and the family from new jersey
[1:02:51] new york and
[1:02:52] our brother uh from brother from brother
[1:03:01] greely yes
[1:03:03] you know what that is
[1:03:05] the elders know
[1:03:10] praise the lord i can't name everybody
[1:03:11] but i thank god for all of you
[1:03:14] as we stand let's go right into the word
[1:03:16] of god i know it's hot
[1:03:18] but just just try to keep your flesh
[1:03:20] from lusting
[1:03:26] yes
[1:03:29] there was a time
[1:03:31] we did not have air conditioning
[1:03:36] there's a time the only heat we would
[1:03:38] have would be those pot belly stoves or
[1:03:41] those
[1:03:42] fireplaces
[1:03:46] sometimes the only warmth you can get
[1:03:48] would get would be those blankets that
[1:03:50] were made and they were so heavy you was
[1:03:52] afraid they were going to pin you down
[1:03:54] to the floor
[1:03:57] but listen people of god we've come a
[1:03:59] long way
[1:04:01] but the christian is not getting weaker
[1:04:06] he's getting stronger
[1:04:11] we're not victims
[1:04:14] we're victorious
[1:04:17] and i don't know about you but by the
[1:04:19] grace of god i see something
[1:04:22] that i know that i gotta have
[1:04:26] and that's more of him
[1:04:30] we're going to read the scripture
[1:04:31] according to second corinthians the
[1:04:33] third chapter the 18th verse
[1:04:39] [Music]
[1:04:44] i wasn't trying to put on a show
[1:04:47] i was trying to let off the pressure
[1:04:53] because you and i must understand that
[1:04:55] it's very difficult for a preacher
[1:04:58] when the audience is quiet and still
[1:05:00] unless he's teaching
[1:05:03] but when you're in a revival you come to
[1:05:05] hear the sound of a revival
[1:05:10] and the sound of a revival is a lot of
[1:05:12] noise praising god
[1:05:17] the deepest part of a revival is when
[1:05:20] god changes your heart
[1:05:24] and when he changes your heart
[1:05:27] you'll cry out
[1:05:30] something has to change
[1:05:33] second corinthians the third chapter
[1:05:35] beginning at the 18th verse
[1:05:39] but we all with open face
[1:05:43] beholding as in a glass
[1:05:46] the glory of the lord
[1:05:48] are changed into the same image
[1:05:52] from glory to glory
[1:05:55] even as by the spirit of the lord
[1:06:00] now i hope everybody understand that
[1:06:01] scripture
[1:06:03] change
[1:06:04] must come
[1:06:07] and none of us can change ourselves
[1:06:10] change comes by the holy spirit
[1:06:16] philippians please 2
[1:06:19] 5 and 6.
[1:06:26] philippians 2
[1:06:27] 5 and 6.
[1:06:30] it reads let this mind be in you
[1:06:35] which was also in christ jesus
[1:06:40] who being in the form of god
[1:06:42] thought it not robbery
[1:06:45] to be equal
[1:06:46] with god
[1:06:48] let us pray
[1:06:50] our dear father god
[1:06:53] lord how we love you
[1:06:56] the fellowship that you and i are and
[1:06:59] that we are having with you are is
[1:07:01] growing in such a great way
[1:07:05] i thank you lord for this time and
[1:07:07] opportunity to know
[1:07:09] where you're standing
[1:07:12] and the place that you have
[1:07:15] promised to reside
[1:07:18] wherein that human beings become the
[1:07:20] tabernacle of god
[1:07:24] father you promise that you will never
[1:07:27] forsake us nor will you ever believe us
[1:07:32] and father we thank you lord
[1:07:35] for the grace and the mercy hallelujah
[1:07:38] that you've brought us through and given
[1:07:40] unto us through all these years
[1:07:44] wonderful wonderful praises have gone up
[1:07:47] before you
[1:07:48] we pray now lord god
[1:07:51] because we realize that without the
[1:07:53] breaking of the bread
[1:07:54] there is no service
[1:07:57] and father i can't break the bread
[1:08:00] you break the bread please sir
[1:08:02] give us all what we stand in need of
[1:08:05] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] you may be seated
[1:08:16] we are the
[1:08:19] a special people
[1:08:21] a chosen people and elected people
[1:08:27] and i think sometimes within ourselves
[1:08:30] we forget
[1:08:31] what we really mean to god
[1:08:36] we forget
[1:08:39] the sacrifice he made
[1:08:42] so that we could have the opportunity
[1:08:44] tonight
[1:08:46] to praise and to worship him
[1:08:51] we need to understand
[1:08:55] that the message or the word of god for
[1:08:57] this day did not come for us just to
[1:09:00] memorize it within our minds
[1:09:04] but the word came to bring change
[1:09:09] and that change
[1:09:11] is to move
[1:09:13] amen from that dark dimension or the
[1:09:16] third dimension into a heavenly place
[1:09:19] is that right
[1:09:20] the bible said we are now sitting in
[1:09:23] heavenly places
[1:09:25] in christ jesus
[1:09:27] and that's only when you've got the holy
[1:09:30] ghost
[1:09:32] hallelujah because you must realize amen
[1:09:35] that there is something that's moving
[1:09:38] amen and you and i must understand
[1:09:41] what's really happening
[1:09:43] god didn't
[1:09:45] come in a way to for us to repeat
[1:09:50] the past
[1:09:53] and if we repeat the past that means we
[1:09:55] not learned
[1:09:58] he did not come to bring us into an
[1:10:01] organization
[1:10:04] or denomination
[1:10:06] but the bible said he whom the son is
[1:10:09] set free is free indeed
[1:10:13] this message this word i mean has such a
[1:10:17] depth to it
[1:10:19] but you'll never understand it
[1:10:22] until you're born again
[1:10:25] because the carnal mind
[1:10:28] cannot understand
[1:10:30] the spiritual things
[1:10:33] of god
[1:10:35] i like to entitle if i was to have a
[1:10:37] message
[1:10:38] change
[1:10:42] change
[1:10:44] and i don't know about you but
[1:10:47] i'm tired
[1:10:50] of seeing satan
[1:10:54] get the best
[1:10:56] of god's people
[1:10:59] when we in this day
[1:11:02] supposed to have a power
[1:11:05] come on somebody
[1:11:07] it's true
[1:11:10] if we've got the holy ghost
[1:11:13] that the sa the early church had
[1:11:17] then the same thing the early church did
[1:11:21] we should be doing it
[1:11:24] but most of us are
[1:11:26] i have to say it the way you want me to
[1:11:28] say it selfish
[1:11:34] it's too much self
[1:11:36] and not enough
[1:11:38] god and you and i must understand in
[1:11:42] order to get god's attention
[1:11:45] you've got to
[1:11:46] die and rot
[1:11:50] a desperation must come into your soul
[1:11:56] hello
[1:11:57] you've got to be tired
[1:11:59] and sick and tired
[1:12:02] of the devil trotting on your territory
[1:12:06] somebody help me this life
[1:12:09] but the only way that's going to ever
[1:12:11] happen
[1:12:13] you've got to have a change of mind
[1:12:17] hello somebody
[1:12:20] we must understand
[1:12:22] that the devil
[1:12:24] he's a cruel adversary
[1:12:28] but he's a smart guy
[1:12:31] is that right
[1:12:32] the first thing he did when it came to
[1:12:34] eve was to change her mind
[1:12:39] because he knew if he could change her
[1:12:41] mind
[1:12:42] he would be able to change her character
[1:12:47] hello
[1:12:48] do you realize that the whole bible
[1:12:52] is a built
[1:12:54] about
[1:12:55] upon changing
[1:12:57] the nature of man
[1:12:59] back to the nature of god
[1:13:03] after the thaw
[1:13:05] god's sacrifice
[1:13:08] of the lamb
[1:13:10] and all through the bible
[1:13:12] was telling the story of how god one day
[1:13:16] would restore mankind
[1:13:19] from that fallen estate
[1:13:22] back to his proper position
[1:13:25] hallelujah
[1:13:27] law couldn't do it
[1:13:30] law was a prison house
[1:13:33] but it was a teacher as well
[1:13:36] because it showed us how sinful we were
[1:13:40] hallelujah
[1:13:42] just so that you know
[1:13:44] the nature of man has it's more corrupt
[1:13:47] now than it's ever been
[1:13:50] but the education of man
[1:13:53] is supposed to be on a superior level
[1:13:56] then if that be true there's something
[1:13:59] wrong
[1:14:00] because it seems like the more you're
[1:14:02] educated
[1:14:04] the more corrupt you become
[1:14:08] look at the world
[1:14:10] but i'm going to tell you something
[1:14:12] satan is a root it's a how can i say
[1:14:16] he's such a serpent
[1:14:18] he's moved slowly
[1:14:22] and he can move so slowly and so quietly
[1:14:25] you won't even know he's there until
[1:14:27] he's ready to strike
[1:14:29] hello somebody
[1:14:31] i'm talking to the young people as well
[1:14:33] because i'm going to say some things
[1:14:34] that i hope gets your attention
[1:14:38] what is the devil trying to do
[1:14:42] he's trying to change your mind
[1:14:47] against the word of god
[1:14:49] hallelujah
[1:14:51] you say well brothers that can't be true
[1:14:53] it is true
[1:14:55] is a time that even science was on our
[1:14:58] side
[1:15:01] but he has changed the mind of people so
[1:15:04] much
[1:15:09] until science
[1:15:11] is bowing down
[1:15:13] to psychology
[1:15:17] y'all know what i'm saying
[1:15:20] even see what i'm saying what i'm trying
[1:15:22] to say is if the devil can get you to
[1:15:24] change your mind
[1:15:26] about god's word
[1:15:28] just one place
[1:15:30] he's got you
[1:15:33] you say well what got your mind let me
[1:15:35] say it like this i went to a wall mart i
[1:15:38] don't say that now
[1:15:41] and i was having trouble with the
[1:15:43] register
[1:15:45] and the lady who was going to help me
[1:15:47] she said well
[1:15:49] she said she will come
[1:15:51] my supervisor she will come and she will
[1:15:54] help you
[1:15:56] and when she came
[1:15:59] she was not a sheep
[1:16:04] don't get quiet
[1:16:06] she was a he
[1:16:09] but the devil
[1:16:12] inside in the way of psychology
[1:16:15] superseded
[1:16:17] biology
[1:16:22] and superseded science
[1:16:25] to this young lady
[1:16:27] was calling that which was not a chi
[1:16:31] a
[1:16:32] she so what are you saying brother
[1:16:35] brooks
[1:16:36] you're going to have to stand
[1:16:42] this is where persecution will come
[1:16:47] because right now the world is so bad
[1:16:51] and so blind
[1:16:53] amen they don't know the how to
[1:16:55] distinguish
[1:16:57] between male and female
[1:17:02] i'm not coming against anybody
[1:17:05] i don't care what you're into
[1:17:07] god is still able
[1:17:10] to deliver
[1:17:12] hallelujah
[1:17:14] and that's what we're here for
[1:17:17] to show this satan eden
[1:17:20] that god is still god
[1:17:22] and that he's the same yesterday today
[1:17:26] and forever
[1:17:27] hallelujah and under this pressure oh
[1:17:30] you may not be feeling it yet
[1:17:33] but he's moving
[1:17:35] and he's slowly moving in a way to the
[1:17:38] world can't even see what's happening
[1:17:41] but the pride of jesus christ
[1:17:44] we can see
[1:17:46] hallelujah is that right
[1:17:48] we can see what satan is doing
[1:17:52] and what is he doing
[1:17:54] you talking about mass
[1:17:56] destruction the spirit of mass
[1:17:59] destruction
[1:18:01] is moving among the people
[1:18:04] hallelujah
[1:18:05] but it has to be because that's the day
[1:18:08] we're living in
[1:18:11] hallelujah see if we weren't living in
[1:18:13] this day of sodom and gomorrah and
[1:18:16] noah's day there would never be a bride
[1:18:19] ready
[1:18:22] oh y'all getting quiet
[1:18:25] but i'm really talking to all of us
[1:18:28] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:18:30] you're going to have to decide
[1:18:32] in this generation
[1:18:34] whose side you're on
[1:18:39] i have a granddaughter
[1:18:41] who stood up for righteousness in school
[1:18:44] and she was circled
[1:18:47] and they were trying to make her recant
[1:18:52] about being a christian
[1:18:54] this is in high school
[1:18:56] she reported it
[1:18:58] to the teachers and the counselors and
[1:19:00] they did nothing
[1:19:06] we're not a people that's going to
[1:19:08] compromise
[1:19:10] oh come on y'all getting quiet i don't
[1:19:13] care what you used to be
[1:19:15] i don't care what you are now
[1:19:17] i'm saying we have a solution
[1:19:20] and the solution is the word of god
[1:19:26] we're not going to give you so sociology
[1:19:28] or psychology
[1:19:30] hallelujah
[1:19:32] wait a minute
[1:19:33] let me say it like this we all say we're
[1:19:35] the bride
[1:19:37] we're the bride and someone said we've
[1:19:39] been married we're the wife
[1:19:41] but i'ma ask you a question where is
[1:19:43] your husband
[1:19:48] where is your husband
[1:19:50] the early church was able to prove
[1:19:53] she was a bride of christ
[1:19:56] because she produced her husband
[1:19:59] hallelujah
[1:20:01] amen peter and james and dad at the
[1:20:04] gator beautiful silver and gold have i
[1:20:06] none but such as i have
[1:20:09] see my husband
[1:20:12] i give this to you
[1:20:15] and you and i must come i'm not even on
[1:20:17] my notes
[1:20:18] but you and i must understand that we're
[1:20:21] living in a time where we're going to
[1:20:23] step from one dimension into another
[1:20:27] hallelujah
[1:20:29] and the only way this is going to happen
[1:20:32] you must be holy
[1:20:34] oh come on somebody
[1:20:36] let me tell you like this we have fallen
[1:20:39] in love with a system
[1:20:44] hello most of these children all they
[1:20:47] know is systematic worship they know
[1:20:49] nothing about the holy ghost
[1:20:54] i wonder how many message people
[1:20:57] died
[1:20:59] loving the system
[1:21:00] thinking it was christ
[1:21:05] hallelujah
[1:21:07] if god told nicodemus you must be born
[1:21:10] again
[1:21:12] he's never backed up off the word you've
[1:21:15] got to have the holy ghost
[1:21:18] hallelujah i'm not talking about just a
[1:21:20] shouting and speaking in tongues i'm
[1:21:22] talking about a life
[1:21:24] i'm talking about bringing the dynamics
[1:21:26] and mechanics together so that people
[1:21:29] can see jesus christ it's the same
[1:21:31] yesterday today and forever
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:37] it's a system
[1:21:42] and what you do not see
[1:21:46] it's the whole time you thinking you're
[1:21:48] okay
[1:21:50] satan is altering
[1:21:52] your mind
[1:21:56] those of you who look at tick tock
[1:21:59] he's altering your mind
[1:22:02] many who look at face i don't know
[1:22:05] nothing about this stuff but i'm saying
[1:22:08] those things are directed
[1:22:11] by the prince of the air
[1:22:16] hallelujah
[1:22:18] oh it's the truth
[1:22:20] you say heap but he slowly does it
[1:22:23] he slowly does it
[1:22:25] and what we fail to see is that he's
[1:22:27] changing you once he changes your mind
[1:22:29] he changes your character
[1:22:34] for thousands of years god has been
[1:22:36] trying to change the character of the
[1:22:39] people
[1:22:41] hallelujah we tried with the law touch
[1:22:44] not taste not handle not it doesn't work
[1:22:48] because that will not change you
[1:22:51] you know what changes men and women
[1:22:54] repentance
[1:22:56] are crying out to the living god lord
[1:22:59] i'm wrong and you're right
[1:23:05] this is just a foundation i hope
[1:23:10] let's move on
[1:23:11] because people don't believe that
[1:23:16] we must produce jesus
[1:23:21] yeah
[1:23:22] you got to produce jesus
[1:23:26] the jesus of this day
[1:23:29] the word that's been opened
[1:23:31] the almighty god
[1:23:33] we are supposed to be the messiahs
[1:23:36] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:23:38] and i'ma tell you this you can work with
[1:23:41] all your might
[1:23:42] it'll never happen
[1:23:45] until you and i surrender
[1:23:48] hey
[1:23:50] surrender to what the word of god
[1:23:54] when we surrender god will then come
[1:23:56] along and bless us
[1:23:59] hallelujah
[1:24:00] but we're so busy i hope this is okay
[1:24:03] brother i just got to preach it anyhow
[1:24:06] because i i see things that i don't like
[1:24:09] it's so systematic to people don't even
[1:24:11] know how to come to church on time
[1:24:16] even in the system they still fail
[1:24:19] because that's law
[1:24:21] but when the holy ghost is in you
[1:24:23] you can't hardly wait till the doors are
[1:24:25] open
[1:24:27] y'all see the
[1:24:28] difference the difference is
[1:24:32] the holy ghost moves
[1:24:34] and when he moves you move
[1:24:37] hallelujah
[1:24:39] and that's what god is looking for he's
[1:24:41] looking for people who knows how to move
[1:24:44] when he moves
[1:24:47] change
[1:24:50] we would never have to worry about the
[1:24:53] way people dress
[1:24:55] if they stayed in the word
[1:24:57] and if they had the holy ghost
[1:24:59] hello somebody
[1:25:04] but we preach to those who don't have it
[1:25:07] they think they got it
[1:25:12] but when god is in you
[1:25:14] he checks you out every morning
[1:25:18] every day
[1:25:20] all day
[1:25:22] hallelujah
[1:25:24] let me get back to them
[1:25:26] the bible said be not conformed to this
[1:25:28] world
[1:25:30] but be transformed
[1:25:32] by the renewing of your mind
[1:25:35] huh
[1:25:36] that this that ye may prove
[1:25:39] what
[1:25:40] is that good and acceptable
[1:25:43] and perfect will of god what the perfect
[1:25:47] will of god is for your mind to be
[1:25:50] renewed
[1:25:53] and your mind can only be renewed
[1:25:55] uh by the word of god
[1:25:59] the holy spirit comes to renew you
[1:26:02] change you from the inside out
[1:26:08] oh help us lord
[1:26:10] how many y'all want to change
[1:26:13] come on
[1:26:15] don't be ashamed let me tell you
[1:26:16] something that in itself shows that
[1:26:18] something's wrong
[1:26:20] when you you don't want to change
[1:26:22] then what has happened
[1:26:25] who has bewitched you
[1:26:28] what serpent have you been listening to
[1:26:32] because you must realize without being
[1:26:35] changed
[1:26:36] you'll never make the rapture
[1:26:40] because this is what the message has
[1:26:41] come from come forth to change us from
[1:26:45] glory to glory to glory
[1:26:48] hallelujah that means the power of god's
[1:26:50] supposed to be increasing and not
[1:26:53] decreasing
[1:26:57] hallelujah
[1:26:59] in another revised age it says be not
[1:27:01] conformed to this age
[1:27:05] and you and i must understand to be
[1:27:06] transformed it means to be changed
[1:27:09] into something different
[1:27:11] a different thing
[1:27:13] but to be deformed it means to distort
[1:27:16] the shape
[1:27:17] or form of or make
[1:27:19] mishap misshapen misshapen in other
[1:27:22] words amen
[1:27:25] when you go through all these and you
[1:27:26] say we're not doing it
[1:27:29] but let me let me cause i'm finna get
[1:27:31] i'm gonna move from this place
[1:27:34] but i've gotta i've gotta say this by
[1:27:35] the grace of god
[1:27:37] that we gotta be careful
[1:27:41] at the things we read
[1:27:43] the things we look at
[1:27:46] the inspirations
[1:27:48] right
[1:27:49] and you've heard me say this before and
[1:27:51] i'm not making a doctrine out of it but
[1:27:53] i'll say it like this i never understood
[1:27:55] why holiness women would go into
[1:27:57] victoria's secret
[1:28:06] it's a spirit
[1:28:12] it's a spirit
[1:28:15] and you wonder why lust is on your mind
[1:28:20] oh see jesus
[1:28:22] if we're going to have a revival we must
[1:28:25] get the trash out of our lives
[1:28:28] that's what it's all about getting the
[1:28:30] trash out of our lives
[1:28:34] hallelujah
[1:28:36] oh we can shout and still be trashy
[1:28:39] we can dance and still be trashy
[1:28:42] we can speak in tongues and still be
[1:28:44] trashy
[1:28:46] but when the holy ghost get ahold of you
[1:28:49] he's going to cleanse you from the
[1:28:51] inside out
[1:28:53] and you won't even want nothing to do
[1:28:55] with trash
[1:28:58] oh come on somebody
[1:29:00] y'all know it's the truth
[1:29:02] you got to know that you've got to be
[1:29:04] changed
[1:29:05] the bible says no unclean thing
[1:29:08] will enter in
[1:29:10] the bible said god said according to
[1:29:13] malachi 3 i am the lord and i change not
[1:29:18] the saddest part about everything
[1:29:22] is that people seem like they're not
[1:29:24] thirsting for more god
[1:29:28] i've been a christian a long time
[1:29:31] but i want more of him
[1:29:35] i see things that i don't like about me
[1:29:38] that needs to be changed
[1:29:41] and i don't know about you by the grace
[1:29:43] of god
[1:29:44] young people this is just a foundation i
[1:29:46] hope whoever comes after me do a better
[1:29:48] job than i'm doing because i'm trying to
[1:29:50] let god have his way
[1:29:55] what you're going to do
[1:29:57] when you're confronted
[1:29:59] with the issues
[1:30:02] of this life
[1:30:04] and your bossman says
[1:30:06] except you do this
[1:30:09] or except you do that
[1:30:12] you don't have a job
[1:30:14] where will you stand
[1:30:18] hallelujah oh nobody's looking
[1:30:22] nobody know what the boss has said to
[1:30:24] you
[1:30:25] but he does
[1:30:28] you understand me
[1:30:30] i'm not talking about these mean
[1:30:32] arrogant christians that so
[1:30:34] self-righteous till they treat people
[1:30:36] that are different with the evil spirit
[1:30:39] that's not what i'm talking about you
[1:30:41] got to love the unlovable
[1:30:46] you got to love these people you don't
[1:30:48] know who they are
[1:30:53] y'all understand me
[1:30:56] paul said in corinthians and such were
[1:30:58] some of you
[1:31:02] i hope this is okay
[1:31:04] because you know what
[1:31:05] i'm coming to your house
[1:31:08] sometimes y'all have babysitters
[1:31:11] you better know your babysitter is full
[1:31:12] of the holy ghost

[1:31:18] with somebody who says they're in the
[1:31:20] message
[1:31:26] come on somebody
[1:31:27] you better make sure your babysitter is
[1:31:29] converted
[1:31:31] and that you've done a thorough
[1:31:33] background check
[1:31:37] a lot of these children are getting
[1:31:40] defiled
[1:31:42] oh come on
[1:31:46] by somebody you brought in the house
[1:31:52] huh
[1:31:53] it's nothing but the truth
[1:31:55] let me tell you something a girl does
[1:31:57] not go wild
[1:31:58] just to go wild
[1:32:02] somebody has touched her
[1:32:07] a boy doesn't go wild just to go wild
[1:32:10] somebody has touched him
[1:32:13] oh y'all looking at me like i'm crazy
[1:32:16] see a drastic change of nature
[1:32:20] shows that there's something that caused
[1:32:22] the drastic change
[1:32:26] i hope this is okay
[1:32:27] i got to tell her like he wants me to
[1:32:29] tell it
[1:32:30] see but the only thing that's going to
[1:32:32] help you in your house is that your
[1:32:34] nature be restored
[1:32:37] hello somebody
[1:32:39] we've got to have a restored nature not
[1:32:42] some man's nature but the nature of god
[1:32:47] hallelujah
[1:32:52] trying to act like malachi 4 ain't going
[1:32:53] to restore your nature
[1:32:57] having
[1:32:58] belt buckles and cowboy boots and all
[1:33:00] that kind of stuff that's not going to
[1:33:02] restore your nature
[1:33:06] the only thing that you're going to
[1:33:07] destroy your nature is that you get down
[1:33:11] to business with god
[1:33:13] there's only one real place of worship
[1:33:17] true place
[1:33:18] and that's under the blood of jesus
[1:33:20] christ
[1:33:21] that's in the heart
[1:33:38] i guess you say brother brooks preaching
[1:33:39] different this time
[1:33:42] i believe i'm more serious this time
[1:33:47] listen
[1:33:48] we come having our tent meetings
[1:33:51] and we come back every year
[1:33:54] and we find out there's harley nobody's
[1:33:56] been changed
[1:33:59] these meetings come to change you
[1:34:03] bless the servant of god
[1:34:05] and all of those who are behind him
[1:34:08] because we come to change
[1:34:12] not just to sing songs and act like
[1:34:14] hollywood
[1:34:16] i'm not saying it y'all know i get i get
[1:34:19] into myself sometime and maybe i get
[1:34:20] beside myself but the point is all glory
[1:34:24] be to god
[1:34:27] and you and i must come to if we're
[1:34:29] going to be the true church we've got to
[1:34:31] act like it we got to be it
[1:34:35] not by words only
[1:34:37] by power and demonstration
[1:34:39] oh i don't even know how to scream it
[1:34:45] we're living in the last days
[1:34:47] how many of y'all really believe that
[1:34:48] the rapture is on
[1:34:51] i didn't say the rapture is going to
[1:34:52] happen i said it's on
[1:34:56] and people are being changed right now
[1:35:00] we don't know the ultimate
[1:35:02] but one thing i know
[1:35:04] we're changing from glory to glory to
[1:35:06] glory into his image
[1:35:09] hallelujah you say i can't be sanctified
[1:35:12] where there was a age
[1:35:16] luther
[1:35:18] wesley
[1:35:20] pentecost they all met their criterias
[1:35:25] justification those who truly believed
[1:35:28] in justification and they lived it
[1:35:31] sanctification they lived it
[1:35:33] why by the power of the holy ghost
[1:35:37] those old pentecostals who really
[1:35:39] thought the gifts or restoration of the
[1:35:41] gift was it they still lived it
[1:35:45] hallelujah and if we be seed we must
[1:35:48] live it
[1:35:50] i don't mean oh i'm the bride i'm seed i
[1:35:53] get sick of that
[1:35:56] there's got to be power and
[1:35:58] demonstration
[1:35:59] and i believe that this is the season
[1:36:04] but we need somebody
[1:36:07] that's got a vision
[1:36:09] somebody
[1:36:10] who's not afraid
[1:36:12] hallelujah and say that the mighty angel
[1:36:15] has come down
[1:36:17] somebody who's going to say that he's
[1:36:19] not standing out on the outdoor of this
[1:36:22] church but he's on the inside
[1:36:25] hallelujah
[1:36:30] hallelujah i've seen miracles
[1:36:32] after miracles
[1:36:34] many of us have
[1:36:35] but that was yesterday
[1:36:38] and he claimed i'm the same yesterday
[1:36:40] today and forever
[1:36:43] hallelujah
[1:36:45] what i'm trying to do
[1:36:47] i'm trying and hoping that god will
[1:36:48] bless us tonight to build a platform of
[1:36:51] faith
[1:36:53] so that the next brother comes he'll
[1:36:55] take us higher
[1:36:57] and the next brother come and take us
[1:36:58] higher
[1:36:59] hallelujah
[1:37:01] that nobody would have to have hands
[1:37:03] laid on them but the power of god will
[1:37:05] come down
[1:37:06] and change you
[1:37:08] hallelujah i don't know about you i'm
[1:37:11] expecting i'm expecting i'm looking for
[1:37:14] something and he promised me whatever i
[1:37:17] ask and believe that i shall receive it
[1:37:20] it's mine
[1:37:23] and that's all god is asking
[1:37:26] he's asking you to believe it
[1:37:28] he's asking you to believe it
[1:37:30] so much so that you live it
[1:37:34] huh
[1:37:36] oh god help us here
[1:37:38] aren't you tired of religion
[1:37:40] come on somebody
[1:37:42] i'm tired of religion
[1:37:44] and you know what people the young
[1:37:45] people
[1:37:46] they need more than religion
[1:37:49] religion ain't going to hold them
[1:37:52] because religion ain't holding you
[1:38:00] we got so many people that can quote
[1:38:01] this and quote that and quote this and
[1:38:03] mean his serpents
[1:38:08] we need some love
[1:38:13] i know love is corrective but i need
[1:38:15] some love
[1:38:17] oh come on somebody
[1:38:21] when i fall
[1:38:23] i need somebody to pick me up
[1:38:26] not talk about me
[1:38:28] not scorn me
[1:38:29] oh come on somebody y'all getting quiet
[1:38:32] now
[1:38:33] oh jesus i'm coming to new testament
[1:38:35] church
[1:38:36] let me say it like this where in the
[1:38:39] bible
[1:38:40] the new testament church ever
[1:38:42] and i'm not scaring anybody because i go
[1:38:44] to doctors too
[1:38:46] but the new testament church didn't have
[1:38:48] to do that
[1:38:49] because they had the power of god with
[1:38:51] them
[1:38:52] the healer was with them
[1:38:54] oh come on somebody
[1:38:57] doctors have their place
[1:38:59] but i'm looking for the great doctor
[1:39:02] i'm looking for jesus christ
[1:39:04] that can turn the tides for every one of
[1:39:07] us
[1:39:08] he's the same god
[1:39:09] he raised the dead
[1:39:12] he opened the eyes of the blind
[1:39:14] is that right he made the lame walk he
[1:39:17] made the dumb talk he changed leprosy
[1:39:20] into cleanliness
[1:39:22] he's the same god
[1:39:24] he said he's the same yesterday today
[1:39:25] and forever
[1:39:27] hallelujah and if you believe that
[1:39:30] he will answer
[1:39:41] while the devil is telling you
[1:39:43] god ain't the same
[1:39:46] while the devil is telling you god is
[1:39:48] weak
[1:39:50] he ain't gonna do that for me
[1:39:53] why wouldn't he
[1:39:56] not one of us in here is righteous of
[1:39:58] ourselves
[1:40:00] every bit of righteousness that we do
[1:40:02] have comes from god alone
[1:40:06] right
[1:40:07] you know i just want to if there'll be a
[1:40:09] sinner in here somebody who really needs
[1:40:11] god let me tell you something
[1:40:13] jesus christ is real
[1:40:17] he can change you if you let him
[1:40:20] he's willing to change you he's willing
[1:40:23] to give you the holy ghost
[1:40:25] but some of us you know what the problem
[1:40:27] is we still got that
[1:40:31] how can i say it denomination or
[1:40:33] organizational mentality we are we all
[1:40:36] thinking the way they taught us what the
[1:40:38] holy ghost was how can they teach you
[1:40:40] what the holy ghost was
[1:40:42] they told you about the gifts
[1:40:45] they told you about the anointings
[1:40:47] they did teach you something
[1:40:49] hallelujah
[1:40:50] but what about going behind the veil
[1:40:54] what about going to that place that that
[1:40:57] that when it when you get there it
[1:40:59] literally changes your whole makeup
[1:41:06] i'm not saying that wasn't good
[1:41:08] but we got to go beyond
[1:41:21] hallelujah
[1:41:25] so
[1:41:26] what are you saying
[1:41:29] we said malachi 4.
[1:41:31] vindicated god vindicated him
[1:41:34] what about you bry
[1:41:36] where's your vindication
[1:41:40] we're slugging along
[1:41:42] when this is the time to be on fire
[1:41:45] anybody want a revival
[1:41:47] y'all understand what i'm saying i'm
[1:41:49] trying to say we want god to pour down
[1:41:52] his spirit
[1:41:53] we know he's here but we want him to
[1:41:55] fill us with his spirit
[1:41:58] hallelujah feel us lord
[1:42:02] feel us lord
[1:42:05] hallelujah
[1:42:07] hallelujah
[1:42:08] we come we come because we need more of
[1:42:11] him
[1:42:12] hallelujah it's not about religion it's
[1:42:15] about him
[1:42:17] it's about christ and you the hope of
[1:42:19] glory
[1:42:20] hallelujah i am determined
[1:42:27] i'm determined
[1:42:30] if i lose all my friends
[1:42:33] i'm determined
[1:42:36] if i lose all my family
[1:42:38] i'm determined
[1:42:42] when i hear the message and the word of
[1:42:43] god preached to me
[1:42:45] i identify with it
[1:42:47] that's me
[1:42:50] when i hear the word perfection
[1:42:52] i identify with it
[1:42:55] that's me
[1:42:56] you know what brother i know what you
[1:42:58] used to be you're right
[1:43:00] it was what i used to be
[1:43:03] but what i am now
[1:43:06] he made me this
[1:43:08] hallelujah
[1:43:10] oh come on somebody
[1:43:13] some people you'll never get listen
[1:43:16] we come to a place
[1:43:18] and i believe god ordained this moment
[1:43:22] he ordained you to be bride
[1:43:24] he'll y'all understand me he put you in
[1:43:26] that position
[1:43:28] so that he can manifest himself for this
[1:43:30] day
[1:43:31] now i'm i'm just talking on a low level
[1:43:33] but my point is this
[1:43:36] if god has had favor with you
[1:43:40] call you to this message
[1:43:42] and you handle it like it's nothing
[1:43:45] what do you think your judgment will be
[1:43:52] let me ask you a question
[1:43:54] when's the last time you witnessed to
[1:43:55] somebody
[1:43:56] about jesus christ
[1:44:01] i'm trying to tell you something
[1:44:03] when the last you literally prayed an
[1:44:05] hour
[1:44:08] oh i didn't keep time i just went on and
[1:44:10] on and on when the last time you had
[1:44:12] that
[1:44:13] oh come on somehow
[1:44:15] you don't have to raise your hand but
[1:44:16] i'm trying to tell you there's a
[1:44:18] condition
[1:44:21] and the serpent is behind it
[1:44:24] because he knows if you lukewarm god
[1:44:26] will spew you
[1:44:29] god is looking for somebody that's on
[1:44:31] fire
[1:44:34] help us lord
[1:44:36] to get on fire for jesus christ
[1:44:42] religion is going to do it
[1:44:44] i don't care what church you belong to
[1:44:47] what brand of church
[1:44:49] the church can't save you
[1:44:51] only jesus christ saves
[1:44:55] hallelujah come on somebody
[1:44:57] i was in a meeting just the other day
[1:45:02] and i think i heard the name of jesus
[1:45:03] maybe five times
[1:45:06] in three four nights
[1:45:10] and this is
[1:45:12] the message of the hour
[1:45:14] they say
[1:45:15] you understand me
[1:45:17] how can you talk about jesus
[1:45:20] and don't mention his name
[1:45:24] the devil don't care if you say god
[1:45:30] he don't care
[1:45:32] if you mentioned william branham
[1:45:35] or elijah
[1:45:36] or moses or noah
[1:45:39] or james or john but the name
[1:45:46] oh i'm in trouble now
[1:45:49] i don't care
[1:45:51] i told god i want me some scars
[1:45:57] when it comes amen to jesus christ he's
[1:46:00] the only lord
[1:46:02] he's the only savior
[1:46:04] nobody else can save you
[1:46:08] hallelujah and you and i must understand
[1:46:12] your religion can't do it
[1:46:15] millions have had religion
[1:46:18] it didn't make it
[1:46:20] i i'm not gonna be too much longer i'm
[1:46:22] way off my notes
[1:46:29] process of life
[1:46:33] one thing i know about life in itself if
[1:46:35] you're the seed
[1:46:36] all you need is some rain and sunshine
[1:46:41] a true seed of god knows how to
[1:46:43] penetrate itself through concrete
[1:46:48] nothing will hold a true seed of god
[1:46:50] back once the light strikes it
[1:46:56] a true seat of god in this moment in
[1:46:58] time in this hour is thinking about
[1:47:01] nothing else but jesus christ
[1:47:04] and what he's getting ready to do with
[1:47:06] us
[1:47:09] i don't even want to put it in the
[1:47:10] future because i'm looking at things
[1:47:12] right now
[1:47:16] i was over there to my sister-in-house
[1:47:18] law house today
[1:47:20] and i hope this is okay i've got to
[1:47:22] preach it

[1:47:33] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:47:34] christ
[1:47:38] she had cancer
[1:47:42] she's just a little notch away from
[1:47:44] being cancer free
[1:47:47] but she was telling me some testimonies
[1:47:49] how she was in a house fire
[1:47:51] they were in the house didn't even know

[1:47:57] and one of the sisters one of the
[1:47:59] friends that would have opened the door
[1:48:00] and the power of the fire
[1:48:02] was so powerful it knocked him against
[1:48:04] the wall
[1:48:05] the whole house was on fire
[1:48:07] started in the attic
[1:48:09] there was no way of escape
[1:48:15] and she heard a voice say peace
[1:48:18] something like that
[1:48:19] she said all of a sudden a hole
[1:48:24] came through the fire
[1:48:28] she got the picture of it i saw it
[1:48:30] a whole
[1:48:32] and she said she told everybody come on
[1:48:34] follow me
[1:48:36] and they ran through the fire
[1:48:39] everybody that followed her never had a
[1:48:41] burn
[1:48:46] hallelujah
[1:48:48] she was telling me
[1:48:50] how that she my brother-in-law they were
[1:48:52] driving on a highway and it started
[1:48:55] raining
[1:48:56] and and the car hydroplaned

[1:49:01] the car was up in the air and she could
[1:49:03] see a distance
[1:49:04] all of a sudden she felt
[1:49:06] something just
[1:49:08] reach his hand out
[1:49:09] and drop the car
[1:49:11] lightly i can't tell her like she
[1:49:14] telling
[1:49:15] but i was having a jubilee
[1:49:18] hallelujah
[1:49:19] because what it is amen she don't even
[1:49:23] have the full understanding like we do
[1:49:25] but one thing she knows is that jesus
[1:49:28] christ is lord and that he's god
[1:49:32] hallelujah
[1:49:34] yes sir
[1:49:36] i was telling her how god healed me from
[1:49:38] cancer
[1:49:39] i said he gave me a faith i can't
[1:49:42] explain she said that's right
[1:49:44] she said when that faith comes you can't
[1:49:46] explain it
[1:49:48] she said it's so supernatural you know
[1:49:50] it
[1:49:51] hallelujah
[1:49:52] listen she said everything the doctor
[1:49:54] told me that was gonna happen to me
[1:49:57] never did
[1:49:58] my hair never came out i didn't lose
[1:50:01] weight in my face she gained weight
[1:50:03] and the doctor said what is this
[1:50:06] hallelujah you know what it is god and
[1:50:10] she had fought stage four cancer and god
[1:50:13] healed up
[1:50:16] with the help of the doctors
[1:50:17] but that's all right god used doctors
[1:50:20] too i thank god for them
[1:50:24] hallelujah
[1:50:26] but what's going to happen
[1:50:28] when the squeeze comes
[1:50:30] and you don't have a doctor
[1:50:33] see if you say you don't have a doctor
[1:50:35] i'm saying you need to get down on your
[1:50:36] knees because we got a doctor
[1:50:40] amen there is one who can heal you
[1:50:44] in spite of everybody else
[1:50:49] hallelujah
[1:50:50] i like to say it like my mother-in-law
[1:50:52] said when they said you was gonna die
[1:50:54] she said did jesus tell you that
[1:50:57] if jesus didn't tell you i don't want to
[1:50:59] hear it
[1:51:02] you understand me i don't know why we
[1:51:04] come through the things we come through
[1:51:07] but one thing for sure at the end
[1:51:09] there's a rainbow and there's a closer
[1:51:11] walk with god hallelujah that he gives
[1:51:14] us i don't care what i got to go through
[1:51:17] that after the storm is over i can say
[1:51:21] god brought me through

[1:54:34] have been such a part of a system and
[1:54:36] i'm like wait a minute
[1:54:39] there's got to be more to god than this
[1:54:43] all of the politics and everything that
[1:54:45] goes with it it's got to be
[1:54:48] what did we do many of the tribes those
[1:54:51] two tribes that went back over it's the
[1:54:53] same thing that a lot of people in this
[1:54:55] message have done
[1:54:57] they went back over
[1:54:58] when we were put in a land to conquer it
[1:55:02] okay
[1:55:04] i'm gonna say this and i'm gonna shut
[1:55:05] down
[1:55:08] we don't even know why god destroyed the
[1:55:10] world
[1:55:14] because of violence
[1:55:16] have you seen the violence lately
[1:55:21] because of perversion
[1:55:24] let me tell you something
[1:55:28] when the children of israel came into
[1:55:30] canaan canaan had riches
[1:55:34] grapes and houses and lands and cows and
[1:55:37] whatever more they had
[1:55:38] but what thing they did not have
[1:55:41] was laws
[1:55:44] that can bring them under conviction
[1:55:47] to their loose living
[1:55:51] hello
[1:55:52] oh come on somebody can you see today
[1:55:55] can you see today
[1:55:57] what the laws are doing to the people
[1:55:59] bringing them into a place where they
[1:56:01] are loose in their living
[1:56:03] and when you're loosed in your living
[1:56:06] you get diseases
[1:56:10] even the children
[1:56:15] oh come on somebody
[1:56:16] so he said kill it all
[1:56:20] destroy it all
[1:56:22] that was god's immune system
[1:56:26] that was god working on the children of
[1:56:28] israel to keep them from that nasty
[1:56:31] stuff
[1:56:33] you said brothers you shouldn't talk
[1:56:34] like that i'm trying to tell you
[1:56:36] something
[1:56:37] we're right on the verge of god dropping
[1:56:40] a bomb
[1:56:43] you and i have never seen the world like
[1:56:45] this before
[1:56:48] and you and i cannot sympathize
[1:56:52] we must be an example of what god want a
[1:56:56] true son and daughter of god and the
[1:56:58] only way we can establish that is that
[1:57:00] we have the nature of god in us
[1:57:07] y'all don't know
[1:57:09] you're sending your children to school
[1:57:10] and some of us don't have a choice
[1:57:14] but the whole time they're working on
[1:57:16] perverting your kids
[1:57:18] changing their minds
[1:57:20] and if you don't have bible study with
[1:57:22] them and show them what the word of god
[1:57:23] says
[1:57:24] you're definitely going to lose them
[1:57:26] you say well how you know that because
[1:57:28] without the nature of god in them
[1:57:31] they avoid
[1:57:33] and all they have is the nature of this
[1:57:35] world
[1:57:36] and when that thing is pulled on by the
[1:57:39] nature of this world they will fall to
[1:57:42] it
[1:57:47] help us lord
[1:57:49] proverbs 13 15. i did not try to be
[1:57:53] rushed rough i had no idea i was going
[1:57:55] to be preaching like this
[1:57:57] but i will say this by the grace of god
[1:57:59] i know that i'm under the inspiration of
[1:58:00] the holy spirit
[1:58:02] and i will say this by the grace of god
[1:58:04] it's up to you
[1:58:06] god has been so good to us
[1:58:09] you know america we should be the
[1:58:11] greatest greatest worshipers in the
[1:58:12] world
[1:58:14] some of us haven't gone over to these
[1:58:16] foreign countries just to see how they
[1:58:17] live and what they don't have but we've
[1:58:20] got more than enough
[1:58:22] right
[1:58:23] we'll go to a hamburger shop and order
[1:58:25] two burgers instead of one
[1:58:30] we got so good in our day we get it in
[1:58:32] large extra large
[1:58:36] it's the truth
[1:58:37] that's the goodness of god
[1:58:42] it is so
[1:58:44] strange
[1:58:48] but it's okay
[1:58:51] because i really know where i stand
[1:58:55] and i'm gonna say by the grace of god by
[1:58:57] his grace
[1:59:00] i know he's in the inside
[1:59:02] this way i worship
[1:59:05] that's why you see when he's here i stay
[1:59:08] connected
[1:59:10] but when he's up there
[1:59:12] that's where you think he is he's
[1:59:13] everywhere
[1:59:14] but in this day he's supposed to be in
[1:59:16] you
[1:59:17] right
[1:59:18] in that day you know i'm in the father
[1:59:21] of the fathers in me and i am in you
[1:59:23] so when he's in you
[1:59:24] you don't you don't carry on like he's
[1:59:26] up there
[1:59:29] you become one with him
[1:59:31] there's a union here
[1:59:33] invisible union
[1:59:34] there's a union
[1:59:37] there's a place you can talk to him
[1:59:39] without even uttering words out of your
[1:59:41] mouth
[1:59:47] i've seen god
[1:59:49] do things without me opening my mouth
[1:59:54] just talking to
[1:59:56] him he's real
[2:00:02] i'm closing
[2:00:06] if we don't do nothing
[2:00:09] say
[2:00:10] lord i may not have gotten a jest of
[2:00:13] what brother brooks is saying
[2:00:16] but one thing i know is that i need to
[2:00:18] be changed
[2:00:23] don't sit here fooling yourself and oh
[2:00:25] grace going to cover everything
[2:00:29] to him that knoweth to do good
[2:00:31] and do it that not
[2:00:34] it's still sin
[2:00:39] and you and i we owe god our all in all
[2:00:45] three months ago
[2:00:48] i have been under so much weight and
[2:00:50] troubles and
[2:00:52] for a long period of time
[2:00:55] the young minister in my life in my
[2:00:57] church says brother books
[2:00:59] my daddy told me
[2:01:01] that all you all preachers are
[2:01:04] responsible for
[2:01:07] is preaching the word
[2:01:09] he can't save nobody
[2:01:12] you know i've i've known that
[2:01:15] but that day it became a revelation
[2:01:21] i felt like the man
[2:01:23] in pilgrim's progress
[2:01:26] all my burdens dropped
[2:01:30] right now i'm the happiest and most
[2:01:32] freest man i've ever been
[2:01:34] even since coming to into this message
[2:01:36] because you see so much i was i was i
[2:01:38] was in the
[2:01:39] apostolic church i had no control
[2:01:42] i i know spirits i see it
[2:01:46] everywhere you look and you say well why
[2:01:48] is it the way it is
[2:01:51] because many of us have done the same
[2:01:53] thing
[2:01:55] we don't call it an organization we
[2:01:57] don't call it a denomination but we
[2:01:59] we've done the same thing
[2:02:04] one brother said something to me the
[2:02:05] other day when i was down in iowa city i
[2:02:07] said ah
[2:02:09] as i got
[2:02:11] eight children
[2:02:13] and they all mine
[2:02:16] they act differently
[2:02:18] but they all mine
[2:02:20] and i said till we start loving each
[2:02:22] other
[2:02:24] even in the differences
[2:02:28] there's only one saving blood
[2:02:31] the bible said by one spirit
[2:02:34] are you baptized into one body
[2:02:37] one
[2:02:40] some things you can't even you have to
[2:02:42] be cautious about what you say
[2:02:47] i don't believe in bringing new
[2:02:49] doctrines
[2:02:50] there's only one doctrine
[2:02:52] and that's jesus christ
[2:02:55] if that makes sense
[2:02:57] but i'mma say this to you and
[2:02:59] to the young people
[2:03:04] don't ever be afraid to talk to your mom
[2:03:06] and your daddy
[2:03:09] i don't care what goes on
[2:03:12] in the family around the family
[2:03:15] you need to talk
[2:03:22] what makes people go wild doesn't
[2:03:23] necessarily mean it has to be something
[2:03:25] sexual
[2:03:28] but whatever it is or whatever it would
[2:03:30] be
[2:03:31] alters their mind
[2:03:35] and brings them to a place where you
[2:03:37] know they they take on a spirit
[2:03:39] i know what i'm talking about
[2:03:41] my own children
[2:03:43] i know what i'm talking about
[2:03:48] and there were so many things i found
[2:03:50] out
[2:03:52] after that
[2:03:57] things that you cannot undo
[2:04:03] if we don't teach them this word if we
[2:04:06] don't teach them you know what god is
[2:04:08] expecting out of them and if we don't
[2:04:11] have
[2:04:12] how can i say
[2:04:13] a place in their heart where they can
[2:04:15] feel comfortable talking with us
[2:04:18] you're going to lose them
[2:04:23] we're the bride of christ
[2:04:27] the mighty counselor is inside of us
[2:04:30] sometimes wisdoms words of wisdom come
[2:04:33] to my mouth i don't even know where
[2:04:34] they're coming from other than i have to
[2:04:36] say thank you jesus
[2:04:41] and those of us
[2:04:45] god still receives confessions
[2:04:49] he still receives a broken heart
[2:04:52] when the last you've seen that
[2:04:55] huh
[2:04:56] when the last have you seen a broken
[2:04:57] heart
[2:04:59] somebody really weeping and crying and
[2:05:01] repenting unto the lord when the last
[2:05:03] year something's wrong
[2:05:05] it ain't the word
[2:05:12] and the closer we get
[2:05:15] to his coming
[2:05:16] to the changing of the body
[2:05:19] to meeting him
[2:05:21] in this way that he's ordained us to
[2:05:23] meet him
[2:05:25] it seemed like the father people get
[2:05:26] away
[2:05:30] i don't know but i sigh and cry
[2:05:34] because of what i'm seeing
[2:05:37] and i've been really crying out to the
[2:05:38] lord not just for my house but for
[2:05:40] everybody's house
[2:05:45] this is a time that god is going to show
[2:05:48] who's who
[2:05:49] and i trust and pray that you're one of
[2:05:51] them
