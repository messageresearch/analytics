we appreciate you and we thank you in Jesus name touch and meet every need through your word in Jesus name amen S I mean Isa Isaiah 61 God is good amen amen I love the Lord because he heard My Cry amen the Bible says here in songs I mean Isaiah 61 I don't know why I want to say song is 61 And1 Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to buy line up the broken heart to Proclaim Liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that moan amen amen God bless you word you may be seated we want to go to Luke dealing with the same thing as Jesus quoted it but it sounds a little different in Luke Luke 4 and 16 and he came to Naz where he had been bought up and as his custom was he went into the synagog on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken heart to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the Blind and to set at liity them that are bruised to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and we notice that he didn't say the day of Vengeance of our god there Jesus said the acceptable year of the Lord amen amen I was talking to my nephew Marcus and David and and just suddenly a sermon just came out yesterday as I was talking to them I just went to writing amen and so by the grace of God I I I trust that it'll be meeting due season I guess this morning is just impressed upon my heart to Proclaim Liberty to the captive amen amen to Proclaim Liberty to the captain amen amen as we enjoyed our conversation and you know it came to me and talking uh uh uh about the word is the word amen amen yes the word never changes I said our our foundation of what we believe amen it's got to it's still valuable amen still stands amen I said but we're not under the law amen but we are under grace amen and let me just uh look at it from the standpoint in John 1 and4 in John 1 and4 we're not under the law he led captivity captive in other words he Proclaim liity to the cap am amen he proclaimed Liberty to the captive amen and and um Luke bought out he he he he came to bring Deliverance Isaiah said those that were in prison amen so it's different perspectives and different angles that we can look at this from different stand points is causing who you are and where you are amen amen but we know that the proclaiming of Liberty to the captive it's uh uh an announcement that you can be delivered you can be free amen amen so he came to announce to you and I that we could be free amen so John excuse me John 1 and4 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and John be witness of him and cried saying this was he whom I speak he that cometh after me is preferred when before me for he was the Bible said in the beginning was a word and the word the word with was with God and the Word was God I was listening to some great preacher on the internet and he was saying that uh the when the word was made flesh he was not God I said Y and he got million uh of thousands and millions of Fallen especially uh the apostolic world and people uh because he talks mean and hard people want to follow that and I said you know this man look like he know what he talking about but when he tells me that the that he's not God I said something wrong I know he was man but he was also God Amen yes amen now when it tells us that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made the word was made flesh see the word was made flesh I don't understand it but the word was made flesh amen amen God was manifested in the flesh he says that's just the inside yeah I understand that that God could not die but I'm not going to take away from what the Bible says are you with me amen the Bible said the word was made flesh so Jesus was both human and divine yes he was both God and man amen you said he couldn't be that why can't he he's God Amen he can be what he said he is amen amen amen are you up man you can't dictate to God and tell God what he can and can't do cuz he is God we might not understand it but we got to believe it amen cuz it's the word amen I'm not going to make two Gods out of it amen yes amen I I I believe it's one God Amen no use in trying to make two gods it's one Lord amen One Faith and one baptism amen no use in trying to explain it but anyway let me just go on and get down to where we were uh but it's good he says John B John B witness 15th verse John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I speak he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was what before me and I heard God's servant say Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of what the New Testament Jehovah God spirit amen is Jesus Christ of the New Testament yes are you with me amen so the god of the Old Testament the spirit God [Applause] is Emmanuel God With Us it's Jesus of the New Testament not two God the same God Amen yes amen but it changed from Spirit to flesh amen amen but he's God are you with me so but you know thank God for all the world want to believe see people want to believe people who make themselves important Jesus didn't try to make himself important he was simply come to the low and the meek amen the poor and spirit amen the ones that needed help amen amen but you know the the the the people that think they got it all and they know everything you can't come to tell them nothing amen cuz they got everything amen that's why I'm I'm glad you can come to the humble The Humble now he says 16 verse for of his fo goodess have all we receive and what Grace for Grace I I thought you know I was looking at the grace this morning and looking at grace and grace and all I thought about and talking to my nephews is the grace of God all I thought about is the love of God amen amen and you know and dealing with the children of God in the church today we it's all about love amen it's all about the grace of God Amen none of us are wory of anything amen it's all about the love of God and the grace of God Amen and I said you know we got nothing to boast about we got nothing to to down or look down on others about it's all about love it's all about the grace of God Amen by the grace of God I am am what I am amen amen and you are what you are it's only because of the love of God and the grace of God that's all we got nothing to BR brag about amen but his grace towards us amen amen thank you Jesus God loves us and that's what we ought to brag about yes amen he said in the 17th verse for the law was given by whoes Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ amen you know the people can take the grace of God and they can begin to legalize and people can they can take the grace of God and try to bind you up and make Grace the law that's right and that's the problem so sometimes we look at amen the dos and don't and you can't do this and you can't do that you can't why this and you can't why that and you can't you know it ought to not be like that it it ought to be the grace of God Amen your uh your your fellowship and your communion with God Amen because God came to amen Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ the law was given by Moses and the law bought by judgment it showed you what sin was amen the law made you conscious that amen there a sin and and the law brought judgment amen there was no law given to give life but if we take the grace of God and we use it a as a law then the people become in bondage are you with me now the gospel should not bring you in bondage but the gospel should set you free am yes amen the gopel you know he said thou shall not steal if you do steal amen then they had a right to do something with you amen amen amen if they caught the woman in the doter they can what stone her to death the Lord didn't have no Grace in it if you did it I F an eye and a what to for to are you with me so if you do it you going to pay for it but Grace came to say woman where are thy accusers amen amen she said I have none he said God forgive you see grace have some mercy in it amen Grace can look at you that you ought to die but I'm going to have mercy amen go ahead on don't go in sin no more amen you huh it set you free amen it freed that one so the gospel Jesus Christ didn't come to bind you up didn't come to make you do amen but it comes to liberate you amen it comes to set you free [Music] amen but some in our walk we feel like I got to to do this way I got to do this I got to do that Grace don't do that it does not bind you up it sets you free let me skip to my end and before I get in the middle and this is something that I had to deal with I if I would use a subtopic I would use he led captivity captive and Ephesian uh 4 I say grace and truth came by Jesus Christ now the people had to deal with that because they were all under the law and they all said we have Moses we have Abraham we have this they were all into that law but none of them could keep it that's right and there was no law to give life you know people have all the dos and don't you can't do this you can't do that yeah and they go crazy if somebody that's their Liberty that is their Liberty if they don't want to live right they don't want to do right that is their Liberty that's right they can either do it or not do it don't you jump on them maybe they don't have a revelation yet that's right are you with me amen oh yeah so what about you used to jump on people yeah I know it amen but sometime you grow up don't you this is all about love isn't that right you can repent at any time amen but I I I'm not backing up off the word the foundation of God's standard is sure and if the foundation be destroyed what can the righteous do amen the word is still the word amen and you though God gives you Grace don't use your grace uhuh to be a disgrace amen so I said I was going to skip to the end just in case I never get there okay so Ephesians 4 God is good amen I love him I I I I'm not going I'm I'm trying to share these things four and seven I I just skip because he says in the beginning of this verse I therefore the prison of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where we he call amen so he he said Paul considered himself a prisoner and and and Isaiah said I come to set the prisoners I come to get the people out of prison that's right but Paul says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord see Paul amen God didn't make Paul a prison prisoner but he himself said I'm a prisoner amen see I I God does not make you a prisoner for him but when he saves you amen it's something that I choose that I want to be amen it's my choice amen the life that I now live is my choice amen and I'm glad to be a prisoner am because God has Set Me Free from something amen are you with me amen so here is let's the set the captive free to let those that were in prison out of prison amen so here it says in the sth verse he said but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the what gift of Christ gift God gift I said God gives each and every one of us his gift he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive what gift of the hly ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost the Bible said the gift the wages of sin is death but the what gift of God gift of God is what eternal life right but every one of us is given a measure of the gift of God God has given you and I each and every one of us a Measure of Faith now what you do with it is your business amen amen amen so here he says in the where I want to get wherefore he said when he ascended what on high on high he led what captivity captive you said what he talking about Led captivity one writer says probably is the forceful expression for the Christ Victory through his death over the Hostile powers of Darkness amen over the host the powers of Darkness he led captivity captive amen amen now when you deal with captivity what am I really implying what am I really talking about I was in I I was in captivity captivity usually deals with to be a prisoner of war to make a prisoner of war amen now we know that we were all in prison one way of another you are a prisoner amen and being in prison is not a good place to be because you bound when you in prison you be talking about somebody that's not free am you can't you're not free to do what you want to go where you want you're a prisoner so you're a dictator you're told what you can and can't do God come to free us from that amen being a prisoner and he led captivity captive amen so by the grace of God now when I when I when I when I look at captivity let's go to Romans 4 by the grace I mean ROM ROM 7 Romans 7 Romans 7 he says in 7 I'm I'm going to skip all the way down to 21 we know that he said but I know that in me that is in my flesh DW is no good thing isn't that right so we we don't look for us ourselves to be any good but we don't know that we were prisoners and we were in captivity and I'm going to show you uh you your prison in the Captivity that you and I were in because Jesus came to Pro Proclaim Liberty amen he come to get you out of the prison amen are you with me amen and if you don't know that you're a prisoner then I want you to recognize that you are a prisoner one way or another you are in prison amen amen but you must understand the prison that you in that there is a proclamation amen that you can be free amen amen so here we are in 21 one he said I find then a law we're not under the law but under what gra Grace ain't that right but I find then a law amen that when I would do what good evil is present with me amen so he says Eve is present for all the light the law of what God God after the inward man but I see another law in my what ESS and what what are we doing he said Waring amen amen Shake somebody hand tell them it's a war going on but you have not recognized it now you don't know you in it's a walk going on but I want you to recognize that you are fighting a battle that's right and the greatest battle ever fought yes sir it's been fought in your mind amen are you with me there is a walk going on amen amen but I got news for the devil that he led captivity captive Jesus Hallelujah Hal Hallelujah the devil don't like this but he can't do nothing about it cuz the devil has been defeated the devil is defeated and he don't want you to know H that he's been defeated glory amen Jesus has forcefully amen through his dying on the cross he used fce amen amen amen I said the violent brother Jo taketh it by force amen devil you don't have no right having these keys he took the keys of death and Hell devil give me those keys they don't belong to you amen they belong to me amen amen are you up there amen hallelujah I used to work in Max and security they says key man key man cuz we had had the keys key man they call you key man cuz I had the keys and we can let them out to go to the rest room let them out to go eat or we can keep them locked up in the cell key man amen Jesus had the keys to death in Hell amen amen amen Satan has stolen the keys because Adam and Eve had sold us to sin are you up there amen but he gave Peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven a't that right amen which Peter used the keys on the day of Pentecost when he said repent amen amen be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen he used the keys to the kingdom but Jesus had the keys to death and Hell amen are you with me amen yes Lord thank God for the keys am amen when you had the keys you had power amen amen amen you got power when you got keys amen praise God you not locked up they're locked up I said you are not locked up the devil is locked up cuz I got the keys now Hallelujah he led captivity captive amen praise God if you give the the inmates or whatever to give them the keys then they loock you up the devil had the keys he had us locked up amen are you with me amen but Jesus when he died on Calvary he forced the devil give me those keys back amen hallelujah amen because he gave Adam and Eve Dominion amen that's right Adam had dominion over the fish of the sea the birds of the air over everything over the Earth isn't that right but he lost and now they said that devil is the prince in the power of the what amen air amen and the devil Amen in this world this world here of Darkness this do this God of this evil age this God oh amen oh the devil but you amen you have heard the gospel of your salvation telling you that you can go free amen amen you heard that Jesus died amen that you can be free warn war going on warn against the law of my what Waring against the law of my what there's a war going on Amen Hallelujah now what can I do about it the war that's going on what can I do about it he said bringing me into what captivity to captivity what this wall that going on in my mind it brings me into captivity to the what to the law of sin and the law of sin got me in captivity I I am a victim I a prisoner I am I need to be free because the law of sin am it holds me in bondage it got me locked up amen Jesus do you see what sin does to you amen it makes you a prisoner amen but Jesus comes on the scene I come to bring Liberty amen I know you've been bruised amen amen but I was brues amen for your transgressions I know you're wounded but I was wounded for your transgression I was bruised for your iniquities amen the chastisement of your peace I put it on me yes Lord Jesus and with my stripes Sir With Jesus stripes with Jesus Stripes somebody said with it stripes with itri I am I am heal amen I'm no longer bound I am free are you free for whom the son is set free is free indeed Hallelujah I'm not serving God all bound up and I can't I can't do this I can't I can do it if I want to but I don't want to do it cuz God been so good to me I said it's too good hey I know I got something to matter the devil don't have this hallelujah hallelujah thank I'm free from the the Lost sin and death amen amen glory to God Amen now the devil don't know what to do with you amen because you're not serving God in I'm oh I can't do this I can't do that I can't go here I can't go there my friends going there friends going to hell too are you with me oh okay I'm all right you all right don't say that this the truth y'all don't want to know the truth amen amen you can be like your friends and be like the rest of them but somebody love God and if you love me he said what keep my when you're in love with them you know if you don't love the person you marry you know what happens it's a miserable marriage because you all doing it cuz you done sign the paper I done said I do and sign the paper I made a commitment so I'm forced to keep my commitment and death do us far are you with me praying every day that you he up and die God can get out this myy are you with me you see what I'm saying but when you love somebody amen it's all different isn't that right yes you go through some tough times sometime but you still love them am amen that makes it different you can make it through the tough times because you love the person and if you love one another you can make it through the tough times amen all the time you're not going to come to church and everybody going be in agreement with you and you're not going to always you know like what you hear or like who you see you know what I'm saying sometimes amen things are going to be tough they're going to be rough but through the love of Christ you can make it through amen every test every trial every tribulation if you just hold on to God's unchanging hand there's a way of Escape God will make it all all right Lord I'm not trying to preach this morning I guess you figured that out so but he says Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my memers 24 oh Wretched Man that I am he said who body of this death but he said I think who God God through what Jesus Christ Our Lord see Jesus Christ gives us what so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the what the law of what sin the law of sin this flesh it's going to serve sin are you with me but I don't want to serve sin because amen I don't want to serve sin I don't want to have excuse that all have sinned all have not not all is Sinners that's right all all have sin yeah yeah but all are not Sinners a sinner is expected to sin that's right are you with me because a sinner is a sinner and they expected to do wrong amen but when One Believes amen they are delivered amen amen than you Jesus One Believes they are set free amen Lord I don't have time to go to galatian but I want you to just look at uh Romans 8:1 he says there is therefore not no condemnation no judgment no condemnation to them that are where in Christ who walk not after the what but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of Life the law the spirit of life in Christ Jesus that's right has made me what fre free free from the law of what sin and death sin and death sin and death amen amen see we don't want to tell folk that you dying when you're Sinner and sin will cause uh natural death and spiritual death amen and if you keep sinning you going to die and you going to experience the second death which is the Lake of Fire amen are you with me all you got to do is continue in sin Grace is here so Romans 6 says uh what should we say say then should we continue in sin that Grace May abound he said God forid forbid that you keep on sinning amen are you with me amen it's somewhere along the line you got to come to a point that I don't want I'm not a sinner and I don't need to be sinning because the Lord God has proclaimed Liberty I am free praise the Lord is not just a song it's a reality I am [Applause] free hallelujah it's reality amen amen something took place in my life amen does a change me God has changed my whole life I said there there's something that's entering into my inside amen the devil tried to stop God from coming he did everything he could to do to try to get my mind where it could not receive but I believe God I needed Deliverance I needed to be free I needed God I wanted it amen I got just what I needed amen hallelujah amen because I I find myself being bound in my mind amen I find myself not understanding your grace Lord I didn't understand amen that way I took take hallelujah hallelujah oh yes I I come out of all of that chaos and all of that confusion because God is notus hallelujah God will never mix you up and confuse your mind that's right amen cuz God is not the author of confusion but i y let's let's take everything simple and let's not take it way out here and way over here let's just keep it simple am amen where a child can understand amen amen when you start wondering to get all sophisticated with it you know that's that's a m go around and God ain't taking you there let's keep it simple when you're wrong you're wrong amen are you with me I don't care who trying to sugar coat

if you ain't given your heart to God if you don't let Jesus come and take away that old dirty nature that old filthy nature up amen that devil going to Ste will keep you in bondage amen but when you allow Jesus to come in yes Lord amen it's not about he's trying to bind you up it's a love affair amen it's him in you amen oh I love you Lord because you really my boms are lifted God you the answer to all my problems amen wasn't happy or sad amen hallah God I praise you through all I go through oh I Want To Praise You Lord I want to say I'm all right I'm all right now Hallelujah GL I'm all right now hallelujah praise God this is about Jesus Lord It's about what he's done for you and I amen praise God the Devils too long have had you in bondage the devil too long has played with your mind amen it's time to just say devil amen praise God I'm not in all this complicated stuff trying to make myself justify myself I ain't trying to justify myself I'm not trying to say it's all right for me to sin and all right for me to do this I I'm tired now amen amen I'm coming back to Simplicity I'm coming back to wrong is wrong and right is right amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord we make it so complex and the Bible so complicated it's all about this is a love letter to you the Bible is all about the love of God and how he's concerned enough about you and I to give his life for you and I and if you're making any complicated I don't know why you made it complicated I got other places to go but y'all know the works of the flesh what I was seeing is this flesh is a prison and the works of this flesh because this is a sinful flesh this was because of the fall of Adam and Eve and this flesh has so many things in it that it desires because it's a it came through disobedient that's right so this flesh would automatically kick in to disobedient to God this flesh is a prison but God came and led captivity you know I I'm just not talking about the physical body I'm talking about even the inward Parts because this outside is is a representation of the spiritual downfall and the adamic nature or the Fallen nature of man so it speaks of a fallen nature and the outside man begins to manifest the inside man amen amen if Christ is the Inside Man and he controls your life and the control tower and you begin to want to please him that's in you thank amen and if the others if the devil is there which is the fleshly you want to please your flesh are you with me so it's a walk continually going on in your members one you amen but he came to Proclaim Liberty that you don't no longer have to please yourself you can please God and notice even when you come to Christ and accept him and he comes in there's never a time when he amen brings you under the law where you can't do wrong well you can't do this or you can't do that or he brings you in if if you don't do this I'm g i I'mma burn you it ought to not come in your mind that he's going to burn you that's not what it's all about he said Christ came not to condemn the world to what to what save it Christ didn't come he come to save you that's right save you from who yourself amen amen to give you eternal life amen it's a but you say I don't know see the devil wants you to think that you in control you in control of your own life uh-uh it's EAS God or the devil amen and you cannot serve two masters amen you're not in control no matter what you how big and how bad or how much you think you in control you're not in control of your life amen amen true what got me is the little children I shouldn't have say it but let me say it anyway the little children said I I I I'm about 10 years old but I think I think I want to be a girl huh I think I want to be a girl and then here's a little young girl about 9 or 10 said I think I want to be a man and the parents say oh let them they made their own decision h Huh what kind of world do we live in and we living in a world where people got good sense you let a little child what the little child say I think I want to kill somebody I think I want to do this I think I want to do that you know some children cannot make intelligent decision so you w't give them a call and say go on out there and drive because you don't trust them to be intelligent enough to know what to do what so you don't give them no driving license amen but you give them are you with me amen the power to make a decision that amen going to affect the rest of their life amen amen amen yet when it comes down to accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and as Savior you you have the ability to say yes to the lord well you say well you ain't old enough I got time to make up my mind I'm going tell you y'all children can be so grown in certain areas but yet they're not matured in other areas right
