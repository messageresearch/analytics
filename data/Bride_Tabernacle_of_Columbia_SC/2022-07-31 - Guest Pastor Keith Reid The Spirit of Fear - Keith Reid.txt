all over but coming from the scriptures according to colossians if we could just stand for a moment [Music] when you know where you come from and you know what you could have been you know just how god saved you i wasn't looking for him but he came to me and all i could think about is how unworthy i am of it but i want to thank him with all my being if you got the scripture colossians 2 and 9 and 10. it says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and powers let us pray heavenly father we come before you lord we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything that you have done for us and lord god you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves father we pray lord god that you anoint the words lord may it fall on good ground this morning oh god our father we pray lord god that you continue to bless the entire service lord we realize oh god that the fire that you kindled in us oh god no man can put it out we thank you father god for giving us a vision to let us see oh god where we're headed and oh god i'm so grateful for that lord bless the service bless the hearer bless those who god hallelujah that stand in need of prayer and those that need to the deliverance if they could just hear the word the bible said by his word they healed them and i pray god of that this morning there will be many that that will be healed just by the preaching of the word bless us now in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated my little thought this morning it's a little different than where the way we were going but i believe with all of my heart that this bible that we we worship god through and with amen is the very essence of his thoughts and we know by god's grace that these these these words were written first in heaven and then god made a way that they would be printed on pieces of paper pages but we understand that the word is not just a word but the word it must become a living word and we understand by god grace that we were written in this book amen and we're great grateful that our names are written in heaven but i there's something that took place in our day that i'm not sure that everybody realized uh we're beyond by god's grace the uh seven church ages and you know we were in the seven church ages and now we were ruled by law we were ruled by touch not taste not hand or not and of course law can never perfect you it took the grace of god to come down in this age no no no no it's not him that will it nor he that run it but it's god who shows mercy and you and i must understand that god vindicated amen this message and so now the move is on the bride hallelujah what god did yesterday is yesterday but he said he's the same yesterday today and forever he does not change his nature he doesn't change his character hallelujah he may change his mask but he's still god hallelujah often time when god comes and he enveloped himself in the human flesh men seem to miss him hallelujah but he purposely do it does it because we realize that he hides himself from the wise and the prudent but he reveals them to the babes and those amen who would love to learn and understand hallelujah i'm glad that god ordained me in this day to be a nobody hallelujah because being a nobody god was able to make me somebody hallelujah amen and you and i must understand that this is not some kind of riddle this is not some kind of rhyme amen but this is something that god has ordained and it must and it will come to pass there will be a bride there is a bride there is a people that will take on the nature of god and that will do the works amen that he said they would do hallelujah i hear the word of god when the bible said that god never left himself without a witness i don't know about you but i'm a witness of this malachi 4. i'm a witness of revelation 10 7. i'm a witness that god has moved amen into a multi-uh body people that's called the bride of jesus christ hallelujah amen and what we must understand is that this bible is the nature of god a letter form and we must understand amen that god is moving into a people that's going to change from glory to glory hallelujah into the very image and likeness of god hallelujah is that right this is why that you and i must understand our focus must change hallelujah our focus must change to a place lord let your nature live in me is that right because remember amen the bride can do something that jesus could not do and let me explain myself jesus said i am the vine and you are the branches see the vine doesn't produce the fruit it is a branches that produces a fruit but we must understand the branches can't do nothing without the vine hallelujah because it is a life of the vine that's in the branches but it's the branches that produces the fruit somebody help me here we must understand we are here to declare that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and for every branch that will not bring forth fruit god declare i will what i will what cast them away hallelujah so we must press into this mark hallelujah you say well where where do we where do we go from here into the shekinah glory hallelujah we must be go go beyond the veil see human ability can't do this your works can't do this hallelujah we're preaching this whole week repentance repentance change your mind let god change your mind hallelujah because you cannot change your mind it takes the mind changer it takes jesus christ himself to come down into you hallelujah to change your mind hallelujah is that right the nature of god is this existing in a person or a person we call the bride you may never do a miracle god may never work a miracle to through you but you you must be like stephen stephen never did do a miracle if he did it's not recorded hallelujah but he knew that god was still a miracle worker hallelujah you say well what do you mean brother brooks listen when they stoned stephen stephen's nature was just like jesus christ so much so he uttered almost exact words when he was being persecuted jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do and stephen said lord hold these things not to their charge hallelujah what was it it was the christ it was a holy ghost it was god in him don't tell me you can't come to that place because we must come to that place because they without us is not completed we can't just preach the old message i know you're tired i'm sorry i'm not i'm not tired yet so anyhow we look at this thing you and i must understand what god is doing for us we used to fear bondage unto fear bondage did you know that every time you move as a christian you have to be careful of the bondage of fear hallelujah paul was talking to the church bondage by what bondage by fear that's why we don't see miracles people are in bondage they fear that god can't do it but i'm a witness what god can do hallelujah i'm a witness i had cancer god delivered me i know what he can do hallelujah i've got a little testimony for over a year and a half i've been getting injections in my eye hallelujah it's a long story but nevertheless amen one injection put me in the hospital and i almost died hallelujah because i was allergic to the medication and so can you imagine getting injections in your eye yes it was a mental battle glory to god but just the other day i went to the doctor here in in colombia and they scanned my eyes and the doctor said the leakage is over hallelujah he said you won't have to get another injection hallelujah now i don't know what my doctor in iowa gonna feel ab you know me about it cause every injection costs about two thousand dollars hello somebody sorry for him [Laughter] but my god is still god hallelujah listen people i can't belong but the bible said we know that this if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens and when you heard from this you've heard this message you've heard from your theophany that's your building hallelujah you understand what i'm saying so i want to say it like this we were born into this third dimension hallelujah but the birth here amen only was leading us to death so you had to be born again and being born again god burst you into another dimension oh we live right we're in the third but once we realize amen that we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus our mindset changes hallelujah the impossible become possible hallelujah god becomes real why because your mind becomes his mind and as long as you stay with the word of god you and his mind god's mind and your mind will be the same [Applause] i don't know about you but i've grown hallelujah i'm sick and tired of this world hallelujah i'm sick and tired of all of the things of the world i'm sick and tired of seeing those who say they're christians being defeated by the devil hallelujah we need somebody hallelujah to raise up and say i am one of them hallelujah being filled with god so much so you don't have to speak all you got to do is lay hands touch them is that right that woman said if i could just touch the heaven this garment i'll be made whole the virtue of christ was so powerful it even flowed into his garment hallelujah come on somebody so was it with the prophet of god the virtue of god was so powerful in him it flowed into his garment it doesn't stop there the virtue of god can be so powerful in you that it'll flow into your garments is that right it goes beyond that the people said if i could just lay into the shadow of peter [Music] my subject is let us move into the headship by moving into the headship we move into the guardship i'm not going to go any further we've got a preacher but i just wanted to encourage you do all you can separate yourself from the world you're not missing anything you're not missing anything just love god give him all you got it doesn't matter how foolish you look to other people give him all you god all you have whatever it's time for that you can't go and work with somebody else what they're doing and what they're not doing shut your eyes to everybody else it's between you and god and god alone i don't care what people think of me anymore i know one thing i love god and god has proven to me that he loves me amen [Applause] [Music] praise god that wasn't the way it's supposed to go but just the brother go ahead and call on brother brooks i said well let's just go with it amen go with the flow what's we thank god for a again for everyone to come and for because i may not come back again we thank god for all the ministries of the gospel election the minister to stand again thank god for you praise god thank you thank you again god bless you appreciate it [Applause] i wish we had more time to let i i know brother cliff is not finished uh but i wish we had some time i will i i want to hear some more but we we we're gonna have to do this over you gotta call it back amen somebody great to god yes time and failures [Applause] brother carry on did an outstanding job with the ministers [Applause] and we gonna ask uh sister david from brother palmer's church should come and give us a short selection as she comes i want brother

[Music] [Music] take complete control [Music] take complete control welcome holy spirit [Music] [Applause] [Music] me fillers with your power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] may god bless everyone brother henry done did it to me i told them last april i i didn't want to speak to to the ministry i hope this is not not scandalous what i'm about to say but um you know it's it's hard to preach to sinners let alone preach preachers and i just wasn't interested in doing that over the years i've it's been a long time now that god came down and touched my life and i told the ministry yesterday i can't talk about it without crying it's just as real today as it was 38 years ago just it has to stay that way and i heard someone say years ago that they were asked a question they said brother what can you give me to guarantee that i'll be in the rapture and and this builder responded and said well the rapture is the absence of sin just keep your life absent of sin just keep your life absolute sin and you'll be there see because god god's presence is the absence of sin and the rapture is the presence of god so it's it's simple it really is and we want to make things uh more difficult than they actually are i appreciate the preaching last night because it was simple brother cliff it was simple it's something anyone could understand and anybody could receive and i think that's the way it's got to be and i keep hearing this this subject brother isaiah over today he said it and you know this word has to become flesh this message we've got is is you know uh this argument that we have in the message of the hour that's been going on for years and years now about what what is the absolute is the message the absolute is the bible the absolute is the prophet an absolute you know and i i i just want to share a little bit with you uh what god has showed me see truth comes in three different forms and every form is an absolute all right truth the written word is an absolute and then the revealed word is an absolute and then what god wanted to do is become the living word and all three are an absolute and it's the same thing with the message the written message is an absolute amen but that will not bring you into revelation god must come down and reveal that to you see and if he reveals it will never contradict any of the absolutes the absolutes can't contradict themselves and so when people say the message is an absolute yeah that's true but that's not going to help the people god has to come down and reveal that to them and and they want us to well we look at paul right there as an example he had the absolute which was a written word see but it was never revealed to him until he met it on the on the road to damascus and and then once he met christ then he became the living word see it's simple it really is and people have made it complex that people are always looking for preachers especially preachers are always looking for a mark of distinction to make them different from everybody else you know that's the truth and i told the ministry yesterday you know the people will make you an absolute the people will do that to you and you as a minister you must be careful to maintain your humility and understand who you you're a grain of sand that's all we are as a grain of sand i tell my church i'm just a grain of sand on a beach in the bronx new york city but i'm an elected great in sand god god put me there see and you know just like brother branham said one drop of water contains everything the ocean contains and so we don't have to be anything big we just got to be who we are that's all and i i tell you this uh this camp meeting has just kind of revived me we've had so many trials i've got a granddaughter back there that had brain surgery a couple of months ago and she was born and there was a hole in her cranium here behind her eye she was born that way and nobody knew it and as her brain began to grow it started pushing into that hole and it was ended up in her in her sinus cavity so she started having trouble with her sinuses and you know leakage and all these these things were happening and the doctors kept giving their antibiotics and and giving her pain medication giving her uh allergy medications and and my my wife's a nurse you know thank the lord my wife recognized that that wasn't really her place 38 years ago she she quit that and she became a christian mother which is a higher calling than nurse and um praise the lord for that i i don't know i i don't mean to knock you down if you're working as a woman and working as a nurse that's not my intention but in our case we just felt like immediately that you know i had i had money i was i was a great white hunter i loved the hunt with a bow and an arrow and i was a fisherman and i did all these things and one of the things i didn't want to do was serve god because i knew he'd take it from me i just knew it right so i finally surrendered to god and just to be sure the next year i went hunting and i shot me a buck there with a shotgun and and i thought maybe maybe it's all right with god maybe i'll be able to hunt it'd be all right and um one morning i woke up i had a jeep back then with a trailer made just for hunting and i woke up that morning and started my my jeep up and i turned on the windshield wipers and cleaned off the snow and i looked and there my garage door was wide open and i saw these steps in footsteps in the snow going over the fence and i went in there and god sent a thief and stole all my hunting equipment took my arrows he took my practice arrows he took my pride my my my hunting uh points and and my target he took everything and i walked in i said lord i guess you don't want me to do that no more and it's okay you know um i hope i'm not going on too much but i i i i you know to get into this it takes more than just a confession it takes more than that you know we and before i knew that martin luther luther did this i remember i think it was maybe 1987 i was in my bedroom praying and i just felt so useless you know i wanted to do something for god so i thought maybe i'll i'll play guitar took guitar lessons for a while and and i seem to have a little talent for it but i just it was like a dead thought it wasn't the right thing so i was praying and praying and i get in my bedroom on my knees and i get to praying you don't have to do the same thing because people want to imitate one another right don't think you have to do the same thing but in my case i i know how i am i got on my knees and i'm praying and praying i said lord i i want to give you everything and i said lord tell me what it is that i'm holding on to and i'll let go of it i promise i'll let go of you and i'm praying and praying and and the lord began to ask of me my job my pension my children and my my wife and my house and my money and my cars and every time i felt like maybe i was trying to hold on to it i'd take a strap and i hit myself with a strap and so i beat myself with a strap in my bedroom years later i found out martin luther did the same thing i didn't know but i just wanted to beat it out of me because i wanted to serve god i wanted to do i wanted to do whatever he wanted me to do you know and i have preachers come to visit us in new york and and they say well brother ivan i'm sure glad it was you and not me and i said shame on you you're there's something lacking in your experience i said because i never chose new york city preachers in this message they choose where they're going to go preach they go look for a place with palm trees and a hammock hanging in the tree somewhere i said but i never did that i said lord send me the timbuktu i don't care where you send me lord i want to serve you lord you know and and brother isaiah's he's told me believe on when when god sent you to new york city he sent the right man i said no brother there's nothing special about me you know i'm just a boy from northern ohio a buckeye i grew up in the woods playing in the river there's nothing special about me the only thing i did was i surrendered it i surrendered that ride and people people want to serve god but they don't want to die out i know what it took for me and i know what the holy spirit listen there's things the holy spirit doesn't allow you to do he doesn't allow you to say he's i call it an emergency break you know you're you're driving down the hill and and the car starts getting out of control god pulls the emergency brake on you that's what the holy ghost is he doesn't let you do that he doesn't let you say those things he doesn't give you a right to choose your life and do what you want to do with your life see i i do believe in repentance i believe that's the key that's the key i told the ministry yesterday that i was in the church three months paying my tithes and offerings thinking i was a message believer and then the lord one day spoke to me and told me i was a sinner and i was so angry with the catholic priest and with my parents and my in-laws because everybody had told me i was a good man and god told me the truth i was a sinner and it changed my life it gave me power to forgive if you can't forgive you're not a christian you're you're lying to yourself hell hell was made for the unforgiving hell was made for the unforgiving if you if you don't have the power to forgive it's because you have not been forgiven yeah and i think we need to preach more on that right go go back to the basics because people are you know i had a preacher one time he come to my my to my church to preach and he had this grandiose idea about about building big churches real fast you know and and building reputations and he said brother ivan listen he said i know how to make your church grow real fast i said is that right he said yeah brother yvonne he could have a big church real fast you know there's five five little cities in one city five boroughs in new york city so what you need to do is have a a service on wednesday and one on sunday and then the other five days have a bible study in every one of your burls and the people that live in your city uh or your church that live in brooklyn gather them together with their friends and their family and and workmates and and and give them a bible study and then invite them to church on sunday and and you know and i said well brother you can't do that he said why not i said well brother what you want me to do is the prophet said that the the statue of a perfect man was like a like a pyramid and that would be like that i said see the foundation is very very wide it takes a long time to put a foundation down i said you can't build it fast now what you want me to do is you want me to build the church this way [Music] very quickly and when you do that any any any little wind of doctrine blow it over i see see the foundation of a church is the is the the family life and i said if i do what you want me to do and i occupy another day of people's time then the father can't be a father the mother can't be the mother see the husband can't be a a husband to his wife there's no time because we're occupying all their time and i said no brother i said the way to build the church is slow and steady and deal with the families and with the children and bring them up and nurture them in the word of god and and i said besides that i don't see the scripture where a pastor gender sheep that's kind of a perversion in it it's sheep that gender sheep see it's a denominational idea thinking that prosperity is big numbers see and brother branham said the prostitution increased 25 percent that doesn't mean that god is blessing prostitution see you know you know what he told me that this message preacher you know what he told me you know what you want to know what i think i said what's that he said i think you're lazy that's what he told me my wife was sitting right there next to me and i said well brother god time will tell tell me time will tell whether you're right or whether i'm right i have no desire to have a reputation i don't have any desire to have a big church i just want the people god sends me that song i see a shepherd a shepherd all he does is take care of the sheep that are born by sheep it's sheep they're gender sheep it's your job to bring somebody into the kingdom and then the pastor takes care of those people see he feeds them the green grass of the pasture and takes care of him that way see so you know that preacher that told me that he rejected the message he left the message three or four years ago okay he never had a clue of what this message is he was just using it to make money drive around the mercedes benz and got a great big mansion see because of the you know what if that were ever to happen to me may god help me to give back everything the message ever gave me i mean it's just dishonesty see you better know who your pastor is i want to finish with this i want to finish with this in your entire life i don't care who you are you may have one man that god sends you as a teacher one man maybe two if god blesses you and you better sit at his feet and you better learn all you can learn because god will hold you responsible for it on the day of judgment you better know who who your pastor is and who that person is in your life timothy understood it was paul and he sat at paul's feet and listened and learned from from timothy and i i've had one or two of those people in my life i feel that way about your pastor here i just need to sit down and listen to brother henry and learn from brother henry you know i'm in a 66 year old body but i still feel like i'm 18. on the inside the inner man never gets old the inner man no get old it's the old man that gets all creaky and noisy and makes makes you feel all that pain so may god bless you we love you with all our hearts and boy i sure wish i could have a me like this in the bronx turn just turn the bronx upside down if i decide to have that would you all come down and [Applause] who knows maybe maybe gotta let us do that i i i have thought about doing it we have two little storefronts that's where we worship we we've uh we've been there 23 years brother gordon was there last year just a little place that's all we got and we've been trying to find a building to buy or lease or do something we just it's just almost an impossibility for churches that don't pool for money and we don't do that right but the reason i haven't had this tent meeting uh and i thought about it over years is because you know i'm sure that if we start playing that music and worshiping god and preaching the way brother keith was preaching brother cliff i will fill the place up but we we have no room for anyone else so you know why have a tent meeting and fill up the church when we don't last year we had over 200 people in that little space and we had 15 or 20 sitting out outside on the sidewalk on metal chairs we just don't have any anywhere to put anybody anybody else so maybe after we get another building maybe we'll do that we'll we'll have a temp meeting there's a little park just just maybe two blocks from my church it's called claremont park and it's right in the middle of the bronx and it's a great big huge park and people fill it up on on the weekends and boy i could just imagine having the temp meeting over there and brother gordon playing his guitar and just oh my goodness we just turned the place upside down and so let's pray for that and you you pray for us uh i've been revived uh it started with brother larry's song on thursday you know we need jesus and i i just was so touched by that i just weeping like a baby i said lord just you know i could i could sit and talk to you about all my problems lord but that's really what i need i need the comforter i need the healer in my life i need christ in my life more it

hair is real short they had to cut her hair and they cut her open like that and and cut her cranium and they went down in there put a patch in that hole to stop the leakage and push the brain back up where it's supposed to be and um but god brought her through it she couldn't walk she couldn't see out of that eye she couldn't hear she couldn't walk for 30 days but god brought out of it i had brother henry praying and god is a healer i believe that you know they let me just say this i know she my granddaughter is very shy she don't like any kind of attention but i told my church the night before the surgery i said my granddaughter is perfect and if your grandfather you understand that i can't find any any defects in my granddaughter she's just perfect child you know and uh after a week or two after the surgery they come in with psychiatrists and they gave her all kind of tests and they were amazed to know this little 17 year old girl knows five languages she taught herself mandarin chinese she taught herself she writes it she reads it and she speaks it perfectly she speaks the sign language she speaks spanish and she speaks english and and uh just she's just a perfect child and she's probably angry right now because she don't like any kind of attention at all but uh we love her and i told you know sometimes you get a burden like that and you don't even know how to pray you know i i said i would nail down the prayer and say lord i can't even talk to you about it i can't talk to you but if i talk to you i'll just break up or fall apart but you know the hurt that i have in my heart father you know you know all about it you just take care of it i'm just trusting you lord sometimes you don't have to talk to pray sometimes you just need to be quiet and let him talk just just be quiet the old pentecostal peoples you know what they call it getting quiet just get quiet with god sometimes it takes two hours to get quiet with god your your mind stops running your mind and your heart is you know running constantly 100 miles an hour just sit still let that all quiet down and then something will happen and you'll begin to pray and you know god is listening and you know

is faith in reverse he's a rata hallelujah amen but i'll tell you amen god is telling his people fear not fear not not only that but fear it is a spirit hallelujah you know sometimes uh amen the devil put complexes in your life and those complexes are about the things that you go through amen you know you take a child a young person even in your young age he meant something might have happened in your life hey man it's changed your characteristic i mean it brings about a spirit of fear i mean we talk about this cause amen that human beings go through hallelujah amen and because of that i mean

is saying something about there's a spirit of fear amen that is over you amen you want to step forward remember you can't do it amen because there's a spirit amen that is hanging over you even the

bible said he that coming to god must believe that he is and that is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him [Applause] hallelujah now is spirit and fear is a spirit a spirit is helpless if you

hallelujah amen how many of you ministers how many you can say amen when i was a little child i mean i could feel the spirit and the power of god even leading me amen i wasn't a christian but there was something in me that tells me that god is a purpose amen for my life and because of that the devil is going to do everything aiming to defeat you he's going to scar you he's going to cause things in your life brother father that when you want to stand up hallelujah you say you can't stand up because look at who you are oh hallelujah that is why it takes more than just a confession it takes more aiming than the shaking of an anger it makes the whole fashion holy ghost baptism of the holy ghost amen that radio of every spirit that hold you and it takes god himself to come down in that life aim and clean up the mess that is in your life oh hallelujah glory but you don't want to let him do it hallelujah what happened you got with a certain crowd and the spirit of that crowd comes on

spirit him and keep coming back to his house he's a rat there's only one force that can do it it's the power of the holy ghost hallelujah but the devil has pulled all over message people as oh they said ah you're trying to preach to the people the baptism of the holy ghost when they already believe brother branham message amen well may i tell you this amen it was five years after i started to listen and believe that message that god filled me with the holy ghost hallelujah glory to god and as long as you think that way the devil is satisfied hallelujah and you know deep down in your life

bone your cassette sanctimoniously oh glory i don't care the color of your skin i don't care your ethnicity or glory i don't care your language anyone fire is inside of your boner it's got to be

when you are dead hallelujah tell your neighbor this morning there's a spirit on me i know there's a spirit on me you you better forgive me i i don't oh i remember i went to kenya and the brother said to me was going to interpret for me he said brother are there really christians in jamaica because when he looks on the map when he looks at everything that is advertised he thought that jamaica was a long beach with women in bikini hallelujah and the night sunshine and the white sand beach or you see reggae with a big god just spliff in his mouth amen but i'll tell you none of that he may motivate me amen i've got the power the fire of the holy ghost amen when i was 18 years old i was running from god and god says stop and fill me with the holy ghost and i've got a dancer that the devil can't take from me hallelujah amy you know may i say this to you hallelujah you know the tablet of moses was a tabernacle they called weight because he had to wait on the shekinah glory of god to come down amen and the shout was in the camp he's a rat but when god set up the tabernacle of david it was a tabernacle of worship hallelujah the psalm said hallelujah worship the lord in the beauty of holiness oh gloria amen some of you feel like amen when i'm in church i can't say amen but i tell you the holy ghost is deep down in you there's a amen that is coming out to the word hallelujah glory and when god was when solomon came and put that temple together oh hallelujah even it was time for his dedication amid the chicago glory of god come down in that household amen that the priest could not minister because of the glory of god hallelujah amen i tell you that's the host that we are in this morning this is a cabinet club david hey come on with me somebody they say you shouldn't dance when you're in the house of god but i'll tell you what god rebuked david for taking you ra's wife god rebuked david hallelujah for counting israel but god never hallelujah even rebuked him when the ark of the covenant which represent the word of god was coming back to israel and david began to dance [Applause] i i don't believe in no choreography of dancing all you black people you sometimes claim your prayer your praise break that's not the real dancer oh glory when you dance for god he ain't got no set pattern the bible said brother brooks when david was all to move the bible said he leaped hallelujah elite elipe hallelujah when he had no more move he leap [Music] [Applause] when the spirit of the lord comes on me a dance like david dance hallelujah glory man without the holy ghost you are possessed with the spirit of the devil hallelujah you were born in sin shaping iniquity you came into the world speaking lies you were possessed and that's why the first thing that god does when you're justified by faith hallelujah and become sanctified ridding yourself of the things of the world god fill you with the holy ghost amen i'd like to see not the reformation but the transforming power of the holy ghost amen that somebody that was shot up in this shell hallelujah amen wouldn't move hallelujah but when the holy ghost come aim like oh glory to god and the anointing him and break that cocoon even see them step out hallelujah i'll tell you how the cliff farmer is water amen but i see him dancer he's a writer because the holy ghost amen doesn't watch your skin color is that right it is the power of jesus christ in your life oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh sometimes you know what the devil does we put it on brothers and sisters oh you know they say this about me well i'll tell you one thing if the holy ghost is inside of you somebody's going to say something about you they either hate you or they love you and i ain't worrying if you don't like me because one thing i know you gotta love me to be there because god gives you the spirit of power and of love sometimes we sit in the same church and we don't talk to one another oh hallelujah because a devil enter sister so and so to say something about you amen to an hypocrite and it takes an hypocrite to be a tear bearer go jesus and the worst thing the bible said is brethren that turned brother against brother or sister against sister israel oh jesus my lord you never tell them when they were telling you the story that listen i want you to tell me right because as soon as you tell me i'm going to tell brother jones you you know what that old demon will do stop talk they're not trying to make it right they're trying to carry a spirit aiming around in the church they're trying to bring confusion and if there's one thing that david want to do in every church he want to bring confusion he want to turn bridges against brethren you want to turn pastor against the member and the member against the pastor how do you want to turn people against people i want to say he do everything in his power he means to cause you to disagree with one another remember the bible said resist the devil and he will flee from you [Applause] hallelujah brother keith i don't like your tire him and i don't like the way you set your shirt maybe i tell you i don't like your long tongue oh hallelujah jesus had to look
