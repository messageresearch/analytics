I prayed in every move of the Holy Ghost somebody might oh God worship and Lord God somebody must get a hold of you Lord for the Holy Ghost should move that the power of God to come forth in the name of Jesus would be glorified God heal the sick save the lost oh God restore the backslide the Lord oh God I urge you to move here today but we're trusting in your unfeeling Word of Promise we look to the hills now from which cometh our help realizing that our [Music] may your word have its way today in our lives father in Jesus name we pray amen The Book of Romans 1 and 16. and Mark 8 34. Romans 1 and 16. for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and to Salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jews first and also to the Greek Romans I mean Mark 8 34 Mark 8 and 34. says and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and for the gospel the same shall save it for what shall a man profit if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul and whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterate doctris and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he come in his glory of his father with his Holy Angels may God bless you read his words you may be seated we want to talk about being ashamed of him you know I was just spraying it as I was praying it just comes so in my spirit that reason why people live the way they live in them why they responding is because of the shame that they have of being a Christian the reason why people fear to be Christians and they are embarrassed to be called a Christian and but there are many that take on the name of Christian but impersonating Christianity they're not really Christian but they'll I want to speak to those that are embarrassed a shame to be identified to be called Christians not those that say they're Christians and in person in Christianity we have those what we call hypocrites that will amen impersonate Christianity that would want to be in the Forefront and want to be called by his name but they don't want to live the Bible says let everyone the name that name of Christ let him depart from indicative amen there's some that want to live the way they live but as he said in the the seven women would take hold of one man and said let us eat our own bread but let us be called by your name in other words we want to do our own thing but we want to be called by your name and so there are people want to be named called by the name of Jesus and they want to be Christians but they want to eat their own bread their own Doctrine their own teaching their own way ideologies what they think about Christianity what they think about Jesus how they want to serve them they want to do their own thing but I'm not ashamed Paul says of the Gospel it's something about the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God to Salvation to everyone to believe praise God the reason why amen people are shame because they don't believe but he says I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God unto salvation day everyone that bleeds people got a problem with believing and because they have a problem in believing amen then they'll shame some folks believe that like the devil does the devil bleed but he trembles amen praise God he can't live this word he don't want to live it he wants to amen imitating and personate in persons y'all got it but he don't want to live it isn't that right y'all understand what I'm saying amen so folks uh uh that those are one that looked timid because uh uh the reason why people are a little timid and a lot because they're not sure they're not sure of their salvation they're not sure of their conviction they're their commitment to Christ they're not sure so they're embarrassed because Amen to speak of something that they're not sure of they're not certain of so when they're speaking they don't it don't have no effect because they're embarrassed of it are you up man because of embarrassment because uh I'm not sure of what I believe and I'm not sure what I believe that I'm ashamed of it because I'm not convicted of it I'm not even convinced of it myself so why should I share with somebody else what I'm not sure of I'm not sure of any matter of my life and how I live I'm not sure of it am I really a Christian am I really saved am I really accepting the blood of Jesus Christ am I really wash am I really clean do I really take the gospel and let it be effective in my life I am not just going through the motion I'm not sure of who I am and what I am and what I'm standing for but when you're standing for something and you're certain of it amen you can take a boldness about yourself amen I believe that Paul had a boldness about amen the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen that I'm not ashamed of it praise God I'm not embarrassing them and I'm not intimidated by praise God hallelujah so Jesus came to a point and his disciples and those that were gathered around him that he wanted to talk to them about him let me talk to you Bob amen if you're gonna follow me praise God I know that amen we sometimes we've been falling for a season but I want to make sure that you understand the effect of what it takes to follow me for what I do for you but are you willing they're following me to pay the price you know I I talked about as I was praying are we ready are we willing to trust God with our life in his hand you know I we get on the plane and we fly amen from you know sometimes those long trips you got a long thinking you're over the ocean and I'm flying over the ocean and you know sometimes you're on those flights for uh 10 hours sometimes 18 hours flights but you know we have Pilots that we trust our life in their hand you know you won't get on the plane unless you have enough confidence amen that and this plane gonna get you to your destination so we we put our life in the hand of the pilots are you up there and we sit down and relax but we're not willing to uh to trust God enough to put our life in his hand and say Lord I'm headed for Glory and I'm trusting you to get me there are you a man but we think that it's something that we're gonna do to get the plane Amen to our destination but it's nothing that you can do you just sit back and relax it's the paladiness amen so what I'm saying is the holy spirit that you attracting to get you from Earth to Glory it's God Amen that's going to teach you that to your final destination if your glory about in your Heaven bound amen then God is the pilot amen and he's going to get you there safely safe and sound I have arrived it might be a little turbulent on the way are you up man you know one time I was coming from England and I and I think one of the ladies she had a child in a child was crying and she said to me she says after a while you know because I'm used to you know flying and you know you go through a little tournament everything between the calm down but the plane Shook and Rock from England all of you back to the state and I said that's the first time I had a flight when they tried to go above the turbulence under the turbulence no matter which way they go it was still rocking and you're talking about folks were drinking that's when the drinks was free by the time we got there I believe everybody to drink was good and drunk because it went through so much tournaments you see sometimes amen but we're still we made it are you up there NASA on some flights it might be a little rocky but even you just gotta trust the power you're already in this plane you can't jump out of it you can't see it I can't go back home you you had to we were I think we were New York mine we're coming and ain't nothing we could do because we were there and I'm saying sometimes on this Christian walk you still got to trust the power when things get a little rocky when you have turbulence in your life you got to still trust the problem you can't I mean what would you do open the answer though and try to jump out the plane but when you got on the plane you you know it's a possibility I've been on that natural plate it's a possibility that this thing could crash amen the the pilot could go to sleep I don't know you know what I'm saying but yet you still put your hand in the confidence of the Bible now that you know Jesus you know God is able so you're not trusting and you're shaking getting afraid when things get a little turbulance in your life things gonna look different could you still send God I know the commitment to you my commitment was not to the church not to the preacher not to nobody but you Jesus and I'm trusting you now I'm trusting you in the midst of my travel time trusting you it's God there's no amen turning around and no getting out of this I made up my mind a long time ago God I'm in your hands my life is in your hands are you up there and when your life is in his hand amen said I'm not ashamed notice amen twins going off to college gonna face difficulties life is that way amen you're the ones you know you're facing travel times some of y'all just started back in school someone just got in high school are you going to represent amen are you going to represent how are you going to How You Gonna Stand and what are you going to stand for oh you're gonna be uh sucked in by the crowd about my opinion some professors are going to tell you no no don't believe in this God ain't nothing really amen you got everybody don't know which way to churn don't know what they are amen man don't know what to do man or woman don't know what she's a woman people don't know where they're standing but God the word is still right in the midst of a mixed up world in the trouble World God's word stealing right praise God if we trust the word of God and we trust the Lord Jesus Christ he said ashamed of me in my word are you a man don't be ashamed of me and my wife because he is the word of one amen if you're ashamed of him your shame of his word and every hour amen we must recognize in every day and every hour that was a message that was a message in every hour Moses had a message for the people amen and Moses couldn't be ashamed of pharaoh are you with me he went down the Pharaoh and says God should let my people go Pharaoh said who you and who is this God that you you're standing for and see that's what you got to believe that the god that sent you amen that he's in you and greed is he that is in you that he that is in the world Amen to all hell might break out are you up there trouble might come out on your hand but you got to look up there's nothing I Look To The Hills as David said from which cometh my help for my help comes from the Lord Lord I'm in your hand i'm trashing you now well yes with trouble causing the squeeze come on things don't look like it's going right well I still trust in you Lord oh I'm depending on God regardless so Moses went down and look like look at this you know I'm just water and I'm looking at a a king that's over the world and Pharaoh that conquered alien Nations when I'm coming down and of people that's in slavery and bondage amen a lot of Great Men probably were there and women and amen but I'm coming down as a one-man invasion you know I'm not ashamed for what I come to represent in the word that God has given me is in my mouth I'm talking about the word of God for the hour you live in must be in your mouth for your word in the hour you live in will bear a reproach because it would be what it takes to defeat the Devil in the time you live in are you a man so you must be convinced that I got what it takes praise God to divide in it now tell the devil you can't harm me that's not my anointed do my prophets no harm Hallelujah because you've got stimulation of the revelation amen you know where you stand you know what you believe amen praise God you're not just oh I go down here pharaoh God say let his people go you gonna do it maybe you will maybe you won't but I see oh God say you know how you when you're intimidating you're not certain you speak with hesitation they can tell in your voice telling the mannerism in which you express yourself that you ain't certain but it's something that Moses I believe he went with his head up with his rod in his hand I believe that he went with confidence because he had met God in a burning bush and God had revealed himself to him and he knew the hour had come and it was a time for the children of Israel they were supposed to be in bonded for 430 years and 400 years he said after that I am coming down and I will deliver them but Moses didn't know that God was going to use him to do it amen but his mother and father he was a proper child and he put him in a bastard are you up man so amen praise God not all together understanding how God's going to use you what God is going to do in your life how your life is going to be even a reproach to the enemy how are you going to be able to bear as he left of God and as those were clean and procrastinated before the foundation of the world they'll stand up for adultery send for an adulterous generation that you would be a standard your life will stand as a standard praise God in this generation God has some amen young people something and not all the people elderly people God not somebody that would take a stand in a Quicken and precise generation but God got him in a chosen generation around your priesthood somebody that gonna take a stand somebody they're gonna say God I'll take up my cross and I Will Follow You Lord I'm willing Lord I'm not ashamed of the Gospel not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ somebody that's going to take a stand but there'll be many that says it passes right over the head because even though it's not resonating it's not really touching Jesus is not worth it the world is offering us too much too much Glam or too much glow the world is often too much too many shiny things the devil is offering you too much because if you go God way it's going to be God's despite its way it's going to be a straight and narrow way the way of a Christian when he said my yoke is easy my burden is life amen but the joy that he gives us the peace and assurance that praise God don't we go through things somebody say oh you're willing I'll tell you what if I could change a nickel and get a billion dollars it'd be something wrong with me not to do it I got five cents and I can change it and I can get a billion dollars for about five cents you know it'd be something wrong with me out of the ordinary if I wouldn't do it if all I had to do was give you this five cents and I I can have a billion dollars all I have to do is take this old filthy life this pest house that's by reason the strength is three four years and ten but and by reading the four score years and 80 years and if you live a hundred it's just borrowed years and I can have eternal life it'd be something wrong with me if I would not take eternal life in exchange for this life and say Lord I give you this uh this 80 years or this hundred years I give you that for eternity I I brought that changing he said what prophet a man the what gain the whole world and what those are soul your soul gonna spend eternity with God amen but in in the meantime you escape it was told a story about a a young young lady coming home from college and with their friends on the train and she came over college with her friends on the train and her mother was there to meet her and uh they saw her the friends on the train they saw her mother there and the mother had been in a fire and got burnt and she looked just you know someone you know how a person is burnt all up in the face and all in and the girls on the on the train was ooh that you know how how high that woman looked ooh she looked a mess you know oh shoot she was like and they didn't know that that was a young lady's mother and then and the girl she was ashamed to let them know that that's my mama you see what I'm saying and kind of to know that when when a mama wanted to greet her off the train you know she almost like who that lady is you know I want to avoid her you know but somebody I almost wanted to remind this young lady the reason why your mama is in the condition that she was in the house caught on the Fire and she was left in the house and the marble went in to save her and her mama ended up getting burnt because the mama saved her life are you a man instead of happy and thankful she was ashamed not knowing the amen that she could have been dead she could have been gone are you up man Jesus the gospel that you reject the gospel that you don't want nothing to do whatever because people laugh at him these people decide to reject in the Bible said that's obedient we should desire him he went to hell and went to amen and the Pains of hell he said got a hold of me he felt the pain and added in one of his life to be judged at the center he was embarrassed he was a bit to save our City amen he was acquainted with priests and abandoned himself and we're here that's why our faces from him praise God we didn't want him maybe he said if not with the cross of Jesus a king that was rejected the Bible said he came to his own people and they said the king of the Jews and they said he's not our King because they look for their King to be valid they stand up and attitude judgment the rule when I wrote a hand but they said he's not our King I wondered this morning is he okay will you be like them that day will you deny it and be ashamed of him he said he's not okay whether it be something there'll be something that we've been in Christ can't you see how they're doing my Lord be identified I love you still my Lord that was living there that was stood up all of them they was crying because they knew that I believe I know what it's going through but I don't quite understand it now but I love him anyhow praise God it's those that held over feel yourself when he was in an astray he cursed and swear I don't even know the man I was saying to say I know Jesus said I know you don't do it Peter but when you're doing I'm praying for you because I know the devil is trying to serve you as we when they're praying for you that your faithful you're not [Music] praise God but he said I know something Peter you're still going to do the job that I did for you to do but why don't you desire I still prayed for you that's the in spite of it I know one day you're gonna be converted but after you converted strengthen your brother are you with me I'm not going to take the Keys of the Kingdom away from you keys praise God you're gonna be converted you're gonna be all right I don't care how far you went I don't care what they've ever done to your life we need God said you're gonna be converted I don't want to you're good still gonna do what I did for you amen still belong to me praise God hallelujah you're still belong to me amen Peter was able to stand up on the day of Pentecost and he stood up for Jesus but that was after the Holy Ghost came he was filled with the Holy Ghost and he stood he wasn't the same then history tell us Peter died and they crucified him he said don't do it up straight up but do it upside down amen because he wasn't denying him no more amen praise God I'm not I'm not afraid anymore I'm not ashamed to be identified with them Paul one day he was Prosecuting the church because he didn't bleed but when the light shine from Heaven it said Saul Saul why persecute on me he said I'm Jesus amen praise God to come to a part that they thought him in prison they whipped him and they beat him well he said I still stand for amen I know somebody said I know that my redeemer lived praise God job was able to fight the good fight amen he was able to stand in the midst of everything turning together losing all he had which was one of the richest man in the half at the time and I lost my riches a lot of family I lost everything my life going down to just nothing I'm just full of swords and can't even walk okay can't hardly talk but nevertheless would hold into God's unchanging hands I'm in a state that I love you Lord oh I've been trusting you yet still and I won't be ashamed I won't be ashamed I'm still going to hold on amen how about you brother sister how about you what what it's going to take Amen to turn your back oh hallelujah or what it's going to take for you to make up your mind that I persuade it yes I persuaded that he loves me I'm persuaded that it's blood live in Washington makes me clean I'm persuaded that he dies with my sin Jesus love me this I know for the Bible tells me so oh my God so loved the world gave His only begotten son I want to love it back how about you do you love him amen is he worthy of you giving your life to amen because he gave his life for you is it worth it to you that you make a a solid commitment to God I want to give my heart to you and I said Lord amen I want to just be in your hand I mean I'm not going to be in control of my life anymore I'm gonna put my life in your hand I put my life in your hand amen will you do that this morning will you put your life in his hand and when you
