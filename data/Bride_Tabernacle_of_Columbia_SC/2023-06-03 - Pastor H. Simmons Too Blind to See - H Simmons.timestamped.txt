[33:45] the book of The Second Kings
[33:52] sixth chapter
[33:55] 11th verse
[34:00] 6 and 11.
[34:07] Second Kings
[34:09] sixth chapter the eleventh verse
[34:12] and therefore the heart of the king of
[34:15] Syria were sure trouble
[34:19] for this thing
[34:21] and he called his servants and said unto
[34:24] them
[34:26] will ye show me which of us is for the
[34:31] king of Israel
[34:33] and one of his servants said none my
[34:39] Lord O King but Elisha
[34:43] the prophet that is in Israel tells the
[34:48] king of Israel
[34:50] the words that
[34:53] thou speak it in thy bed chamber
[34:57] and he said go and spy where he is that
[35:04] I may sin and fetch him and it was told
[35:09] him saying behold he is in Dalton
[35:14] therefore sin he
[35:18] did the
[35:20] horses and chariots
[35:22] and a great host and they came by night
[35:27] and can pass the city around about and
[35:32] when the Servants of the man of God was
[35:36] risen early and gone forth behold and
[35:40] holds can pass the city both with horses
[35:43] and chariots and his servants said unto
[35:47] him alas my master how shall we do
[35:52] and he answered fear not for they that
[35:56] be with us are more than they that be
[36:02] with them
[36:04] and Elisha praying
[36:08] and said Lord I pray thee thee open his
[36:13] eyes that he may see and the Lord opened
[36:18] the eyes of the young man and he saw and
[36:22] behold the mountain was full of horses
[36:25] and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha
[36:30] Alicia
[36:32] God bless you read this word you may
[36:33] received it
[36:38] oftentimes
[36:43] we
[36:45] walk
[36:47] by sight not by faith
[36:50] so
[36:53] and oftentimes we
[36:55] the world
[36:57] has its way of blinding us
[37:01] and the world had his mind
[37:04] as the song says I was blind but now I
[37:07] see
[37:09] so we're talking about too blind to see
[37:12] and if you was reading the unveiling of
[37:14] God you'll see a lot of times the
[37:16] prophet we're stalking him out to blind
[37:18] to see
[37:20] so two by two blind is C
[37:23] oftentimes
[37:27] what the devil shows us is different
[37:30] from what God shows us
[37:33] but because
[37:35] it was the way we were born
[37:40] to contact this Earthly place
[37:43] with here tasty and feel and touch and
[37:48] so I mean those five senses amen
[37:52] now I want to go to Genesis 3.
[37:57] the devil is doing the same thing he
[38:00] ever did
[38:01] Jesus Christ is same yesterday and today
[38:04] and forever
[38:05] the devil is ever the same too
[38:09] as he said there's nothing new Under the
[38:11] Sun
[38:13] the schemes and the tricks and deception
[38:16] that the devil used
[38:18] you know
[38:19] in Genesis and all through the Bible
[38:22] he's still using those same tactics and
[38:25] you know who's falling fun
[38:27] the same kind of people
[38:30] are falling for the same
[38:33] schemes and tricks of the devil
[38:36] those that
[38:38] said I would I would have believed then
[38:40] and don't believe now
[38:43] the people that don't believe nine would
[38:45] have been back there if you put them
[38:46] back there they would have done the same
[38:48] thing that those people did
[38:53] so by the grace of God as I was saying
[38:55] in uh something on Wednesday about
[38:58] the days of law
[39:00] said it was a time where only eight
[39:02] Souls were saved just say
[39:06] when the whole world
[39:08] so
[39:10] if it was that close
[39:13] then we ought to take the most Earnest
[39:15] Heap to Think Through Hillary
[39:17] at least in any time when she letting
[39:18] them slip
[39:20] God is a serious God
[39:23] and our journey to heaven
[39:27] God wants y'all to I mean we want us to
[39:30] really recognize that this thing is
[39:33] going to thin out
[39:36] as we approach the end time it's going
[39:39] to be very few people that want God
[39:42] the devil is is he blind in the
[39:45] beginning
[39:46] he's going to Blind many today because
[39:48] where their hearts ain't in it
[39:51] well your tragedy is that will your
[39:53] heart be also
[39:55] their hearts and their minds
[39:58] said in Genesis was continually evil
[40:02] that's what they were they had their
[40:04] mind the devil had successfully
[40:07] blinded the mind
[40:09] of the people in Genesis and he
[40:11] successfully blinded the mind now
[40:14] of the whole entire world
[40:18] has been hoodwinked
[40:20] has been blinded by the devil
[40:24] alone
[40:26] don't you think that he would not come
[40:30] into Brian Tabernacle or into any
[40:35] Church no matter what his bride or
[40:38] message or whatever the devil is still
[40:41] working
[40:44] but God is so not willing than any
[40:48] should perish
[40:49] but it all should come to repentance
[40:53] but
[40:55] the prophet God said if we're blind it's
[40:58] because it's our choice
[41:01] he blind Israel
[41:04] for our sakes
[41:07] are you with me
[41:08] for our sakes he blinded them
[41:12] but if we are blind it's because we want
[41:14] to be blind
[41:16] are you with me
[41:19] so here in Genesis 3 now the serpent was
[41:24] more subtle than in any beast of the
[41:27] field which the Lord God made
[41:30] and he said unto the woman
[41:34] yea has God said you should not eat of
[41:39] every tree of the god
[41:41] you know your flesh don't want God
[41:45] your flesh does not want God so
[41:49] so you're not expecting to please your
[41:52] flesh
[41:55] you have to battle and you have to fight
[41:57] just to be in the house of the Lord and
[42:00] you have to fight to pray the Lord
[42:01] because your faith your flesh will never
[42:04] want to praise the Lord
[42:08] your flesh would never want to lift
[42:11] Jesus up
[42:13] your flesh would always
[42:15] want to
[42:18] dishonor disrespect God
[42:23] you don't know which what time it would
[42:26] be
[42:27] when your mind and your heart will be so
[42:30] darkened
[42:32] that you would not be able to see God
[42:36] you don't know what hour it'll come
[42:39] because as much as God loved Adam and
[42:42] Eve
[42:43] he yet gave them a choice of what they
[42:48] you gave them
[42:50] made them free moral agents
[42:52] and you have a choice you can do right
[42:54] or you can do wrong
[42:58] but you know it's not many make the
[43:01] right choice
[43:03] the reason why because it's not in man
[43:06] to make the right choice
[43:09] it's just the mercy of God and the grace
[43:11] of God
[43:13] it's the grace of God that we can see
[43:15] the word and love God
[43:19] it's not P many people that's going to
[43:22] love God there's not many people in this
[43:24] day in this age it's going to really
[43:26] carry anything about God
[43:29] because God is not important to their
[43:31] lives
[43:32] this is to Here and Now God is not
[43:35] important
[43:37] they don't even want God the world don't
[43:40] love God don't want God and they feel
[43:43] like they don't need God
[43:46] but here
[43:48] that same devil
[43:51] you know if that's not a hungry that's
[43:53] not a love I want God if your mind is
[43:57] just so blank and so void and so dull
[44:02] that there's no that you don't even
[44:04] listen to the word you don't never open
[44:06] your Bible you don't never really want
[44:09] to pay attention in churches all we want
[44:11] to do is get up and walk and walk in
[44:14] prancing you know we don't even care
[44:18] we don't get serious about God
[44:21] our mind just
[44:23] you printing out fingernails and yeah
[44:27] it doesn't matter
[44:30] I don't care
[44:32] but once we find out I'm serious about
[44:36] God
[44:38] lord it's you that I'm on and when I
[44:41] come to your house I'm arning you
[44:45] and I want to I want my soul to be fed
[44:49] I want something that anchored me I want
[44:51] you to speak to me
[44:53] that's why we come early and kind of get
[44:55] in proud and that's no more early coming
[44:58] and getting in prayer anymore people
[45:00] don't do that no more
[45:03] we just don't come early and get in
[45:05] prayer we come late and we're ready to
[45:07] go on time
[45:10] you know what I'm saying
[45:13] come early get in prayer expecting God
[45:16] to move Lord let me get all of this that
[45:19] I've been through the day out from me
[45:21] Lord I want to just settle down and I
[45:24] just want to relax and try to get in the
[45:26] mood of the spirit where we come just in
[45:29] time
[45:32] you know
[45:34] not knowing we got to get our thoughts
[45:36] our mind right up Spirits right and kind
[45:39] of mellow down and said Lord I need you
[45:43] speak to my heart
[45:47] we come to a place
[45:49] that
[45:50] we are we expecting to hear from God are
[45:54] we expecting a word from the Lord are we
[45:57] just going through the motion of
[45:59] traditional worship and coming to church
[46:02] but when we come with the unexpectation
[46:05] that I want to hear something that Lord
[46:08] I'm going through some stuff those are
[46:11] the times we want to hear God only when
[46:14] we're in trouble we want to hear God
[46:17] I was reading
[46:19] today a Christian psychologist
[46:23] and he was telling about his battle with
[46:27] being an agnostic
[46:29] and um he was saying in his battle
[46:34] uh uh uh not
[46:37] because he he was telling how people
[46:40] become atheists
[46:42] how you say the 80s
[46:44] 80s and how they become agnostic
[46:49] and he said it's you that come into
[46:51] childhood
[46:53] it's usually in childhood time
[46:57] and it's usually it's what they see in
[47:00] the home
[47:03] and uh and they say it's usually the
[47:07] battle within the home
[47:11] causes that them to come in doubt of God
[47:16] so
[47:18] he said in adolescence usually the
[47:21] people the children are battling and
[47:24] trying to get to know whether God is
[47:26] real
[47:28] it wasn't not they're trying to get in
[47:30] contact they're trying to understand
[47:33] in adolescent age
[47:36] he said that's when he had his greatest
[47:38] battles
[47:41] took him a long time in life
[47:45] to find out God define God
[47:50] so he was talking about
[47:53] finding God in the battles that he went
[47:56] through whether to believe that God was
[47:59] real or was it God exists
[48:02] and if God did exist why is all this
[48:04] turmoil in the world
[48:07] and he could not understand he could not
[48:10] understand all the stuff what's going on
[48:12] why is life so chaotic why so confusing
[48:16] what is the purpose of it
[48:21] I think we all go through that
[48:23] especially in adolescence you know
[48:26] if you hadn't then thank you
[48:29] but a lot of times we we're searching
[48:32] and seeking and wanting to find God
[48:37] but he says sometimes it's what we see
[48:41] in the home
[48:43] those that supposed to know God
[48:47] sometimes it's a loving home sometimes
[48:49] it's one way and that way and they get
[48:52] confused
[48:54] one going this way and the other going
[48:56] that way it kind of confused the
[48:58] children
[49:00] they don't know what the the god that
[49:03] they hear in the Bible the god that's
[49:04] preached that sometimes they're looking
[49:07] to see that
[49:08] they're looking to see that God in their
[49:11] parents they want to see God
[49:13] they want to see the god that people
[49:15] talk about in the church they want to
[49:17] see that God in people's lives
[49:24] so
[49:26] let me go on I I got caught up in that
[49:30] but here the a lot of a lot of things in
[49:34] life blind
[49:36] so
[49:38] blind
[49:40] but here the devil look at the tactics
[49:43] of the Devil look at how what he does to
[49:47] Blind your mind
[49:49] see all he wants to do is get your mind
[49:52] twisted up tangled up messed up and then
[49:55] he knows when he got you in confusion
[49:57] the Bible said God is not the author or
[50:00] what
[50:01] confusion the devil knows when he can
[50:05] get you confused that he got you
[50:09] but he said he gives them perfect what
[50:12] peace
[50:13] and that's what uh you know I I I
[50:16] started this style my top of this uh uh
[50:20] peace perfect peace because what what
[50:24] people need now is to have peace
[50:28] amen but they can't have peace when they
[50:32] don't trust God
[50:35] the neither can they you know ah
[50:40] you know it's something that that the
[50:42] psychologist said he said
[50:45] that a woman lost their child
[50:48] and when they lost the child they came
[50:51] and you know he was you know it was she
[50:54] was grieving
[50:56] and in her grief
[50:58] she said
[51:00] that
[51:02] I
[51:03] all my praying all my living right all
[51:06] my doing this all that and God took my
[51:09] child
[51:14] and God you know I don't understand and
[51:17] why why me why did God do this to me
[51:23] and she was she was so
[51:25] out of it he said most of the time you
[51:28] can't help that person
[51:31] that blame God for all their troubles
[51:36] he said it's hard to help somebody who
[51:39] started blaming God for their troubles
[51:41] and not understanding God see first of
[51:44] all
[51:45] the god that most people worship is the
[51:48] god that gives them all the things they
[51:51] want
[51:53] as long as life is going pretty good he
[51:56] said that's the kind of the god that
[51:57] people have in their mind
[51:59] but when things don't go their way then
[52:02] they don't believe God no more
[52:05] they don't trust God no more because
[52:07] things ain't going their way
[52:09] a lot of folk just turn their back
[52:11] that's it I ain't God ain't real
[52:16] but of God that gives them what they
[52:18] want and that's the kind of God they
[52:20] want to serve
[52:23] so a lot of times I find that it be the
[52:26] truth
[52:27] people have difficult times coming to
[52:29] church if everything ain't going like
[52:32] they wanted to go
[52:34] they have difficult time believing the
[52:36] preachers the preacher ain't saying what
[52:37] they want to hear
[52:41] they have difficult times in school
[52:45] difficult times to live in life
[52:48] peace is not there
[52:51] but when they come down and that's why
[52:54] it says too blind to see if we're going
[52:57] to believe God we're going to believe
[52:58] God by faith
[53:00] if we gonna by faith in God we've got to
[53:04] believe that he is
[53:06] and that he's a rewarder of them they're
[53:08] dealing seeking
[53:09] if we're going to see God we're going to
[53:11] see him by faith
[53:13] amen not by what what happened what kind
[53:16] of experience we had in life we're going
[53:18] to see him by faith
[53:20] amen we're going to the god that uh that
[53:23] that we see by faith in the god that we
[53:26] trust in amen he's going to work things
[53:29] out good no matter how difficult it is
[53:33] oh you look man
[53:36] but we got to know that come in contact
[53:38] with that God and he's got he got to
[53:40] become real to us that God if you're not
[53:44] we're going to bite our fingernails and
[53:46] we our mind gonna be all wear off
[53:49] somewhere
[53:53] he'll never get y'all what we can hear
[53:57] we come to church when we can't we don't
[53:59] hear God
[54:03] we go through the motion we sing about
[54:05] him but we can't hear
[54:07] we can't experience him
[54:11] we talk about it we try to make
[54:13] ourselves believe and that's what he was
[54:15] saying
[54:16] it's a lot of talk a lot of talk but God
[54:19] is not really real to them
[54:22] they have not he said he says there's so
[54:25] many talk what themselves up and talk
[54:27] about to talk and be real religious he
[54:29] said they pray all the time it's just
[54:31] like that woman
[54:32] praying all the time she she prayed she
[54:35] did everything she was supposed to do
[54:37] but when things didn't go her way
[54:40] [Music]
[54:41] um
[54:42] that's the way it is our reaction when
[54:45] things are not going the way we think it
[54:48] ought to go
[54:51] oh you're talking about somebody that
[54:53] could uh bring Habit to the church and
[54:56] chaos
[54:57] a person that is disciplined things
[55:00] ain't going their way
[55:02] are you with me
[55:05] and something happened you know that
[55:09] they don't think it's supposed to happen
[55:11] oh Lord you got a problem and that's
[55:14] what just as much
[55:16] as people can
[55:18] get go Haywire
[55:21] a husband go hey wow and wife right now
[55:23] and children can battle one another and
[55:26] all of that people do God just as they
[55:29] do one another
[55:31] they do God that's denica same way
[55:35] and that but they don't know it
[55:37] he said have you done it to the least
[55:41] of these
[55:43] you've done it to me
[55:45] how can you love God whom you're not
[55:48] seeing and hate your brother
[55:51] who you see isn't that right
[55:53] see a lot of times we don't know that
[55:56] there are spirits that are Fallen Angels
[56:00] just as those angels that will that Eli
[56:03] Elijah those saw there are falling
[56:06] angels that are here to accomplish their
[56:09] job those angels uh that that are Fallen
[56:13] amen they are there to press themselves
[56:16] into your mind and into your life
[56:21] that you may do their will
[56:26] that's another thing we was talking
[56:27] about
[56:30] those angels those Fallen Angels where
[56:32] did it go they're looking for somebody
[56:34] to dwell in
[56:36] a woman
[56:38] they're not all Angels nobody called
[56:41] demons and devils
[56:43] are you up man
[56:45] and if you don't want God in there you
[56:47] got you're going to have demons and
[56:48] devils
[56:50] and those Devils gonna lead you down the
[56:53] path
[56:54] and they're gonna lead you to the things
[56:56] of the world
[56:58] and if you don't want God you're gonna
[57:00] have something
[57:02] you're gonna have demons devils and
[57:04] they're going to lead you now on the
[57:06] path of destruction
[57:09] are you with me but people are satisfied
[57:12] with old spirits
[57:16] just like the prophet the man what's up
[57:19] there beating up the preachers and
[57:22] breaking them up and
[57:25] and then he casted the devil out and
[57:28] fell on his feet and said this is healed
[57:31] and the prophet says no is it is it dead
[57:36] no is it here no he said what is it
[57:40] he said the man loved those spirits
[57:44] if the man love those Spirits you know
[57:47] you can cast it out but he's coming
[57:49] right back and to you won't do you want
[57:52] you don't want those spirits
[57:55] but a lot of times people are satisfied
[57:57] with being like they are because this is
[58:00] me
[58:02] you got to die to yourself daily
[58:06] you got to stop being you
[58:09] you're satisfying and content with being
[58:12] you
[58:13] but God does not want you to be you
[58:18] are you with me
[58:20] God don't like you
[58:25] amen
[58:27] you you know
[58:30] amen your flesh cannot please God
[58:34] your flesh shall not love God it's
[58:37] enmity against God and it does not want
[58:41] to obey God at all
[58:44] so where you are this is me God don't
[58:48] want you
[58:51] God is asking you to take up your cross
[58:56] and follow me I want you dead
[59:03] the only way Christ can live Paul says I
[59:06] Die daily and as long as you die to
[59:09] yourself Christ can live
[59:13] but if you were satisfied being no own
[59:16] little special person and your little
[59:21] attitude of thinking that you are
[59:24] special glad you are God don't want it
[59:29] are you a man
[59:31] see Christ is wanting you to look in the
[59:34] miracle and you got to see Jesus in the
[59:37] mirror not you
[59:39] are you with me
[59:41] because as long as you see you it's
[59:44] things that you got to commodify
[59:46] things got to be crucified
[59:49] amen all right that's why Paul says you
[59:52] know I pressurize the mark of the prize
[59:54] of the High Calling we're too we're too
[59:56] into ourselves and think that we are
[59:58] really Christians we're really soldiers
[1:00:01] of the Cross you're lying to yourself
[1:00:04] and that's why you can't have the joy uh
[1:00:08] and the peace that God wants you to have
[1:00:10] is because amen we we can tell ourselves
[1:00:14] lies
[1:00:15] make ourselves feel like we can have joy
[1:00:18] outside of God
[1:00:20] that's only an invitation of will Joy
[1:00:23] that's the only invitation of real peace
[1:00:25] that's not really amen
[1:00:29] Jesus said my peace I give you not as
[1:00:32] the world give give I you
[1:00:34] the joy that God gives you amen is the
[1:00:38] joy that's in the Holy Ghost
[1:00:40] the joy of the Lord is by
[1:00:44] strength Amen to see God move in our
[1:00:47] lives and see God keep us to see God
[1:00:50] bless us
[1:00:52] to see the things that God does for us
[1:00:55] well that's what made me excited amen
[1:00:58] this afternoon as I meditated on the
[1:01:01] Lord when I got excited about is that
[1:01:04] God got so many blessings that He
[1:01:06] blesses with yet we choose to get what
[1:01:09] the devil is off enough
[1:01:12] not knowing that God blessings are far
[1:01:15] beyond
[1:01:17] amen
[1:01:18] God Amen his joy unspeakable and full of
[1:01:22] Glory
[1:01:23] but you'll never experience it as long
[1:01:26] as you listen to what the devil said
[1:01:28] as long as you believe the devil's lies
[1:01:31] you'll never experience the joy of the
[1:01:33] Lord you'll never be at peace because
[1:01:37] you think that you're gonna get it on
[1:01:40] your own
[1:01:41] you think you're gonna get happiness and
[1:01:43] you're gonna make it through life and
[1:01:46] without God I'm gonna tell you something
[1:01:47] you're lying to yourself
[1:01:50] if life can become miserable it can
[1:01:53] become difficult without God
[1:01:57] amen
[1:02:00] I'm talking to somebody
[1:02:03] and that's what people struggling with
[1:02:06] the woman let me go back here to this
[1:02:09] I got I got the clothes because I didn't
[1:02:12] mean to be long tonight
[1:02:13] but uh
[1:02:18] in the woman saw a woman said unto the
[1:02:21] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:02:24] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[1:02:27] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:02:29] garden
[1:02:30] God has said you should not what
[1:02:33] eat of it need to show you what
[1:02:36] least you what
[1:02:37] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[1:02:40] should not well
[1:02:42] let me tell you the devil is speaking to
[1:02:45] you you can do what you want
[1:02:47] you got time
[1:02:50] you can do exactly what you want you got
[1:02:52] time
[1:02:53] you'll get God after a while
[1:02:57] I wish I could bring a bathroom and set
[1:02:59] it in the middle
[1:03:00] everybody just seen the walk walk
[1:03:04] I'll tell you
[1:03:06] and if I don't say nothing
[1:03:08] people will keep walking
[1:03:10] if I said something people will still
[1:03:12] keep walking
[1:03:16] so we're gonna do me no good to say
[1:03:18] nothing because people are gonna walk
[1:03:24] I know the lord the devil is fighting
[1:03:28] you know but I understand see the
[1:03:31] genuine
[1:03:33] the devil will make everybody walk y'all
[1:03:35] know we got to walk in this church in
[1:03:38] America
[1:03:41] they're walking this church in America
[1:03:44] the number one walk in this church
[1:03:47] that means we got to pray these Devils
[1:03:49] out of him
[1:03:51] because folk walk soon the word come
[1:03:54] forward go to walking
[1:03:57] are you with me
[1:03:58] the walk-in grows
[1:04:00] and I'm gonna tell you something you got
[1:04:02] to Cal calm down pray
[1:04:04] hold it
[1:04:08] y'all have been on the road and you had
[1:04:10] to hold it until you get to the rest
[1:04:12] stop or somewhere
[1:04:14] holy
[1:04:16] sometimes you'll find out what number to
[1:04:18] lie anyway
[1:04:20] the trick of the devil it wasn't even
[1:04:23] important
[1:04:25] are you with me
[1:04:28] when I said that at genuine need came up
[1:04:33] you see what I'm saying but you see I
[1:04:36] gotta go but let y'all know the story I
[1:04:39] don't have to read the scripture do I
[1:04:41] y'all know what the devil did to Eve
[1:04:43] right
[1:04:44] he added to see what he wanted him to
[1:04:46] see you know that same devil telling you
[1:04:48] what you're seeing
[1:04:50] what you this is what you want don't you
[1:04:53] don't you see the tree you see this
[1:04:55] right here you see that the devil is
[1:04:58] taking you away from God he's still
[1:04:59] showing you stuff and you say yo your
[1:05:02] eyes will be open
[1:05:04] that's what the day I will tell you you
[1:05:05] know no the devil the God trying to keep
[1:05:07] you away from something isn't that right
[1:05:09] and the devil is convincing people now
[1:05:11] he's using the same tactic why do you
[1:05:14] think these young people go out here and
[1:05:16] experience these things man take a hit
[1:05:18] off this joint man take a little swag
[1:05:21] off of this alcohol man going with this
[1:05:23] girl here like you all kind of stuff
[1:05:26] people are all experiencing all kind of
[1:05:29] stuff because the devil haven't so
[1:05:31] deceived and so blind today believe the
[1:05:34] devil lie and don't know that they're
[1:05:36] gonna die
[1:05:37] don't know that they're gonna go to I
[1:05:40] don't want to say it but I better say it
[1:05:42] because the depth you know
[1:05:44] wait a minute
[1:05:48] in heaven
[1:05:49] where'd he end up
[1:05:51] in where
[1:05:53] he said it I didn't see it
[1:05:56] okay so the devil knows that he can talk
[1:05:59] you out of your blessings
[1:06:02] see that's what the devil does he talked
[1:06:04] people out of their blessings
[1:06:07] God is is blessing abundantly modernly
[1:06:11] but the devil want to talk you on your
[1:06:13] blessings
[1:06:15] don't let the God give you a gift the
[1:06:16] devil talk you out of that gift
[1:06:19] don't let the Lord be using you to
[1:06:21] witness that they're able to talk you
[1:06:23] out of that
[1:06:24] if you stand for God God got so many
[1:06:27] blessings for you
[1:06:30] God want to use your spottedly but the
[1:06:33] devil don't want you to be used by God
[1:06:37] the devil want to mess your life up
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:43] the devil doesn't mess so many lives up
[1:06:46] that we ought to have sense enough not
[1:06:48] to believe him
[1:06:49] but yet we find ourselves still
[1:06:51] believing the devil
