[32:10] god is good tonight amen we want to look
[32:13] at the book of matthew by god's grace
[32:15] matthew 14.
[32:31] matthew 14 and and we'll begin at the
[32:34] 22nd verse
[32:42] you got it say amen and it reads
[32:47] and straight away jesus constrained his
[32:49] disciples to get into a ship
[32:51] and to go before him until the other
[32:53] side while he
[32:55] sent the multitudes away and when he had
[32:58] sent the multitudes away he went up into
[33:00] the mountain apart
[33:01] to pray and when the evening was come he
[33:03] was there alone
[33:05] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[33:07] sea tossed with waves
[33:09] for the wind was contrary and in the
[33:11] fourth watch of the night
[33:13] jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[33:16] and when the disciples saw him walking
[33:18] on the sea they were troubled
[33:21] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[33:24] for fear
[33:25] but straight away jesus spoke unto them
[33:27] saying
[33:28] be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
[33:32] and peter answered him and said lord
[33:36] if it be thou if it be thou
[33:39] be me to come unto thee on the water and
[33:42] he said come and when peter was come
[33:45] down out of the ship
[33:46] he walketh into the water to go to jesus
[33:50] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[33:52] was afraid and
[33:53] beginning to sink he cried saying lord
[33:56] save me
[33:57] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[33:58] his hand and caught him
[34:00] and said unto him oh thou of little
[34:02] faith
[34:03] wherefores did thou doubt and when they
[34:05] were coming to the ship the wind ceased
[34:07] and they that were with that they that
[34:09] were in the ship came and worshipped him
[34:12] saying of a truth thou art the son of
[34:14] god and when they were going over it
[34:16] came into the land of jenesseret
[34:18] and when the men of that place had
[34:20] knowledge of him
[34:22] they sent out into all that country
[34:24] round about and brought unto him
[34:25] all that were diseased and besought him
[34:28] that they might only touch
[34:30] the hymn of his garment as many as were
[34:32] touched
[34:33] were made perfectly whole may god are
[34:36] the blessed to the reading of his word
[34:38] tonight about god's grace we try not to
[34:42] hold you
[34:42] along just but i i entitled it the
[34:45] sermon tonight
[34:47] your darkest hour amen i entitled it
[34:50] your darkest hour
[34:52] you know i like here how jesus i mean
[34:55] how in the scriptures it says that
[34:57] you know it was the fourth watch of the
[34:58] night you know many
[35:00] talk about that fourth watch and when
[35:03] they talk about that fourth watch they
[35:04] say
[35:04] sometimes you know they look at it as
[35:06] the hours of three
[35:07] between three and six you know some very
[35:11] i can say very dark dark hours of the of
[35:14] the night
[35:15] so when we translate that you know
[35:17] spiritually speaking into our lives
[35:20] our lives some very dark times but we
[35:22] want to say in your darkest hour you
[35:24] know i says
[35:25] you know as i was on my knees the other
[35:27] day and i was
[35:28] thinking about ministering on a sermon
[35:31] uh titled it searching for answers
[35:34] because sometimes you don't know what to
[35:36] do
[35:37] the present crisis and stuff that's at
[35:39] hand
[35:40] you don't know how to handle so a lot of
[35:43] times you
[35:44] you you within yourself are searching
[35:46] for answers
[35:47] but we know that god has all the answers
[35:50] you know i was sharing with someone that
[35:52] says we aren't like those that don't
[35:53] have hope
[35:54] but we have hope we live because he
[35:57] lived
[35:58] that's the way we we saw of how
[36:02] he overcame and it says that you know
[36:04] not to fear the world
[36:06] christ told us that he says because i
[36:08] have overcome the world
[36:09] so when we look at the present crisis
[36:13] sometimes i like how the bible says
[36:15] david had to encourage himself
[36:17] because sometimes we got to encourage
[36:20] ourselves
[36:21] to know that in the midst of all of the
[36:23] things
[36:24] you know that we're faced with that we
[36:27] don't have to worry
[36:28] because he will overcome because he
[36:31] overcame
[36:32] all uh all our victory uh i say tonight
[36:36] belongs to christ the battle ain't
[36:39] chores but the battle is yours
[36:40] i mean the battle ain't choice but the
[36:42] battle is the lord's so
[36:44] when we fight him you know i was sharing
[36:46] with the church and something the other
[36:47] day
[36:48] i was saying you know that little song
[36:50] my wife was playing it
[36:52] the other morning fight on christian
[36:55] soldiers you fight on
[36:56] come on it says keep your sword in your
[36:58] hand and you fight on
[37:00] and i thought about that i said that was
[37:02] my motto
[37:03] here with this present crisis and the
[37:06] things that we see
[37:07] taking place to turmoil i said what are
[37:09] you gonna do
[37:10] i said we're gonna fight on you know a
[37:13] brother called me
[37:14] and he was telling me you know of his
[37:15] situations and the issues that he's
[37:17] faced with with his body and
[37:19] all those things and i asked him the
[37:20] question i say well what are you going
[37:22] to do are you going to give up
[37:24] come on i said no you fight on
[37:27] and i was thinking about i says you know
[37:29] i was sharing him how i was sharing with
[37:31] the guy at work
[37:32] he was saying that how his truck broke
[37:34] down and he was like man every time i
[37:36] try to get ahead
[37:37] something happened my car broke down and
[37:39] this and i thought about something the
[37:40] profit of god was talking about
[37:42] he says that you know we always are
[37:45] striving
[37:46] for perfection we always gonna be
[37:48] striving for more
[37:49] you know the thing is you know once you
[37:52] once you think you got a little bit of
[37:54] money it's bills to pay
[37:56] once you get the bills caught up then
[37:57] the car gonna break down
[37:59] then after the car break down you get
[38:01] that straightened out somebody gonna get
[38:03] sick come on
[38:04] it's gonna it's trial after trial test
[38:06] out the test
[38:07] but we got a blessing of surety that we
[38:10] know one thing
[38:11] that the bible declared that what you
[38:13] going through these are light
[38:15] afflictions
[38:16] these these are are nothing to be
[38:19] compared with the glory
[38:21] you know like the bible says he enduring
[38:23] the shame and the cross
[38:25] because he saw what was set before him i
[38:28] began to share i says what it is
[38:29] i says you got to fight on i asked the
[38:31] guy at work i said what you going to do
[38:33] you going to quit
[38:33] come on i said no but you got to fight
[38:36] on come on
[38:37] i said the things you're going through
[38:38] it ain't like nobody else ain't been
[38:40] through them before
[38:41] when we look in the scriptures we got so
[38:44] many clouds of witnesses
[38:46] the bible says that time would fail to
[38:48] tell all of their stories
[38:50] how many believe that tonight so they
[38:53] got stories to tell
[38:54] and when we get over there you can say
[38:56] that they'll tell their story
[38:58] how they made it over but i said i ain't
[39:00] gonna let them be the only one to
[39:01] testify
[39:02] come on but i'ma tell them how i made it
[39:05] over
[39:06] how did you make it over it was only by
[39:08] the grace of god
[39:09] because when i felt like hallelujah
[39:12] giving up come on
[39:14] in my darkest hour jesus showed up
[39:18] he showed up in some form some way
[39:21] hallelujah and that's what we're talking
[39:22] about in your darkest hours
[39:24] i was telling my uncle the other day i
[39:27] said you know it never failed
[39:29] when i'm faced with something or i
[39:31] really need it i'm searching for answers
[39:34] the word of god came i said and what it
[39:36] is
[39:37] when god answers you answer me i said it
[39:40] never
[39:40] felt they never felt that he did what
[39:43] would bring me back to the scriptures
[39:45] in the same scripture that you heard
[39:47] over and over
[39:48] when the lord brings it to you come on
[39:51] then it becomes alive
[39:52] and once it becomes alive it's got power
[39:55] in it
[39:56] hallelujah i like how jesus told peter
[39:58] and those
[39:59] when the bible says that they saw him
[40:01] coming they cried out for fear
[40:03] but one of the first things he says was
[40:05] to fear not hallelujah
[40:07] but be of good cheer i know the storm is
[40:10] raging
[40:11] i know the wind is contrary and the ship
[40:13] is being tossed
[40:14] but put a smile on your face keep joy in
[40:17] your heart hallelujah shout in the midst
[40:20] of the of what you're going through
[40:22] hallelujah
[40:23] like it says i was sharing with the
[40:25] church the other day i said you know i
[40:27] came
[40:27] to the place in my christian journey
[40:29] where i says lord i'm not asking for you
[40:31] to move the mountain
[40:33] i'm not asking for you to take away the
[40:34] storm but what i'm asking you for is the
[40:37] grace
[40:38] and the patience to make it through it i
[40:41] want to wait on you lord
[40:42] i don't want to move so fast god because
[40:45] why when i come
[40:46] out of it i'm going to be better than i
[40:47] was when i went in it hallelujah
[40:49] how many believe that tonight but we
[40:52] find that
[40:52] it's your darkest hour come on i said
[40:55] all the time
[40:57] you know just thinking about it i says
[40:58] we got so many clouds of witnesses
[41:01] when we look through the scriptures in
[41:02] the darkest times that's when god showed
[41:04] up
[41:05] he showed up in such a way and a lot of
[41:08] times it was supernatural happens
[41:10] you know a lot of times god if he wants
[41:13] to he can ease it anytime you want to
[41:15] he can ease a storm or the rain any time
[41:18] he won't but he allows things to happen
[41:21] because he's he's doing something in
[41:23] your life he's bringing out
[41:25] something in you you know when you look
[41:27] back over your life
[41:29] you ought to see yourself growing
[41:30] hallelujah you ought to see yours you
[41:33] ought to see growth
[41:34] in your christian journey the things
[41:36] that bother you
[41:37] you should like he says overcoming part
[41:39] of that overcoming
[41:40] ain't winning one battle and that's it
[41:43] but it's all the little battles that
[41:45] make up the war
[41:46] it's all the little fights and the
[41:48] little things that you
[41:49] that you come through hallelujah then in
[41:52] the end
[41:52] you can you can tell your story how many
[41:54] believe that tonight
[41:56] but i said it's your darkest hour i said
[41:58] as we we taught
[42:00] that by the scriptures that uh uh
[42:03] in the darkest times that's when jesus
[42:05] shows up
[42:07] in those times i don't know about you i
[42:09] was thinking about the things that we
[42:10] faced with
[42:11] and how you know we all in prayer and
[42:14] the sickness and the things at hand
[42:16] but then like i said i'm reminded lord
[42:18] this is the time where you show up
[42:21] this is your hour this is your season
[42:24] because it's out of our hands we can't
[42:27] do nothing about it
[42:28] we gonna need a supernatural guard to do
[42:30] supernatural things
[42:32] we're gonna need that guard that we've
[42:33] been singing about jehovah jairo
