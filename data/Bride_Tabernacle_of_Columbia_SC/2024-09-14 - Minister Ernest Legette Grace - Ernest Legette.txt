at Goliath as the same devil but he still had the same God backing him up the same Lion and the bear is the same devil right but it was the same God that was on his side and there ain't no no battle too hard for the Lord y'all believe that tonight I believe that God has brought us in kept us and watched over us like the eagle in her nest I thank God for his grace tonight amen let us bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your grace tonight Lord and thank you for your mercy Lord oh God you kept us Lord and you watched over us God lord many times we ain't deserving of your grace but oh God your grace still oh God just unmar toward us and we just thank you for that tonight Lord God we thank you for bringing us through Lord pray God if we said or did anything that ain't like you Lord and oh God that would offend thee Lord I just pray you to have mercy upon us and God get it away from us Lord pray God tonight Lord as we got a few words to say Lord that you would take it Lord God and just bless it Lord and oh God that it might be beneficial to your people oh god oh Lord might help somebody to grow there Lord we thank you Lord tonight for your grace thank you for all your mercy in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen want to look at a very short scripture tonight won't be long by the grace of God uh first Peter 5 amen and we'll start here at the fifth verse we want to talk about Grace tonight amen Grace you know I said I wanted to tell my testimony amen amen amen how good God has been to me amen first Peter 5 and and uh five if you got it say amen amen and it reads likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resists the proud and give grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you be sober be diligent because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who have called us unto to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that he has suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen and settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen you may be seated I like that the God of all Grace amen you know tonight I just wanted to talk to you just a little bit about Grace amen you know I was thinking about you know the present trials and stuff and I says you know it's the grace of God Amen God's grace and his Mercy says a lot of times you know uh uh you know God's you got we got to realize God cares about us amen God cares the things you think about God don't care about God cares amen God cares about your well-being see see the devil don't care about you the devil don't care about you the devil desired all us be in pain and hurt and killed or whatever the devil is not your friend on no circumstance you know the Bible says that he's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but one thing about you and I we've got the grace of God With Us when the devil desire to do all kind of things and harm you the grace of God is with you and one thing about that Grace you know that Grace like we said is it's it's an unmar favor is undeserved amen is is which you know it's a gift of like it say a virtue from God and it can't be earned one thing about the grace of God it can't be earned God loves you just because he he desired to love you just by election God chose you Hallelujah and the thing about it is the devil mad with the choice that God made but one thing about it you know that's why we can't be puffed up and Bragg and all that only thing we can do is just give God the glory and thank God for saving us and choosing us out of all that he could have chosen right you think about that tonight I say sometimes I don't know why God loves me the way he does I don't know why God cares and all the times we fall come uh fall shorts of shortcomings and all that but God still he's his grace is unmar his love is unmar his Mercy is always there with you all the time and then what does that do sometimes as individuals we take the grace of God for granted come on we take his love and all that for granted but one thing about it even in his grace and his Mercy he's longsuffering with us and I thank God for that but you know what I says what happens in our lives the trials and the things and all that God bring us through it ought to bring us closer to God come on it ought to make you love God just the more but most of the time it doesn't people think go things go in and out but don't you know the tri tribulation thing God's bringing you through is to bring him bring you closer to him Hallelujah to let you because he's letting you know all the time that I love you I care about you I want to see about your every hurt and your every pain all well-being it's like like he says here the god of Grace all Grace come on but what it is our minds sometimes is focused on us and our what we going to do in life and what we got to achieve and what all our goals and all our wants and all those things but like the Bible says humble yourselves before the mighty hand of God come on and then he'll exalt you in due season come on God God will exalt you God will take you wherever you got to go at in this life or whatever you got to be blessed with whatever God see fit God will get you wherever you got to go and you know one thing about it the devil will try to stop it but the devil can't stop it because he's the Mighty God come on he said humble yourselves before the what before the mighty hand of God come on the God if I can say this tonight I don't know how to say it but God loves you God loves you he the Bible says he cares for you come on he cares for you and your wellbeing God does God cares about you people can talk about yourself do you think God don't care God cares about you you're his little one you're his child God cares about you you know and that humbles your so much you know you think about I says one thing about the grace of God you know I says that God's God's grace God God he gives us stuff that we don't deserve come on many of times you think you deserve things God you don't deserve many of times God gives you things you don't deserve because he loves you amen come on when man fell I thought I was thinking about that when man fell in the Garden of Eden God longed to have fellow ship with man man did wrong but even when they fell by the grace of God he had a Plan of Redemption to get them back in fellowship and that PL that that Plan of Redemption to get them back in Fellowship was going to be something had to die Hallelujah innocent subject but he desired even himself through shedding of his own blood to come down that you and I don't you know that the devil he he he's the one accusing you and I a day and night because God want God to destroy Dy you but one thing about it you were in the mind of God come on you were a part of God before the world began God had a and even though when you were there though you might have been born the way you were born though you might have been the way that you were that God had a plan by his grace to get you back to where he was where he saw you at Hallelujah to get you back to that place so when we see these things you know I begin to just start thanking God because I said God it ain't in me and what I can do but God I just help me Lord just to yield to what you're calling me to yield to what you're bringing me to Lord because I can't you can't get there on your own but it's got to be God bring you into that but your job your and our job is to do what to praise God through all the circumstances praise God through the ups and the Downs through the sun through the rain no matter what comes our way our job is to give God thanks no matter what come on I start looking at things said God I didn't bring myself here you called me you brought me this far and I'm trusting on you to keep on taking me the rest of the way Hallelujah God I don't have the strength sometimes sometimes I don't even feel like I have the will but something keep drawing me keep calling me and what it is I believe the seed that God planted there Hallelujah I you don't even see yourself sometimes as what God said you were but it don't matter how you see yourself it's what God called you Hallelujah he said I know my thoughts concerning you and there thoughts of good and not evil the devil put all kind of things in your mind but God know his thoughts concerning you I ain't looking at how you how you look right now but God know his thoughts concerning you Hallelujah and when he start pulling on you it's something about when he start pulling on you all the Devils from hell can try to hold you back but when God start pulling on you God start calling you you it's it's it's irresistible Hallelujah I believe that tonight come on but it's the grace of God sometimes like I said we take God's grace for granted don't we come on we look at you know I was thinking and I said I want to be long tonight but I says the grace of God he says humble yourselves uh uh before the mighty hand of God come on humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God God is mighty come on he's the almighty God Amen you know God can when God want to put a stop to something he can put a stop to something anytime he wants come on because why he's the Mighty God sometimes we play with God like he's a man or we take him like he's a man but God isn't a man he's not a man like the bible say that he shall lie but he's the Mighty God and the word asks us to Humble ourselves under his mighty hand come on but the thing about it is it ain't that God wants to be your Taskmaster like that but he cares for you come on the devil is your enemy he's the one trying to destroy you amen the devil want to destroy your life sometimes we don't know or realize we playing around but the devil ain't playing with you the devil want to destroy your life there a wrar line you going to tear you to pieces he'll have you out there strung out on drugs all kinds of thing the devil the devil don't care nothing about you when he get in there tear everything up amen come on but God is saying you need to stay up under my mighty hand for your protection come on because we don't know every every hour every minute out the day maybe the devil is planning to destroy your life but the grace of God is there God got a hedge about you that when the devil trying to destroy you God is keeping you God Is Watching Over You God is blessing you yes he is you know I was thinking um I heard last night boy I growed up with it say he had a m heart attack must have been in the car and and died driving down the road got in a bad accident but I says the thing is you know that's we as individuals got to be ready at all times it the thing thing is you know I I just kind of just go ahead on you know I was at work the other day and and uh it could have been all over with just like that right all over with you know we were having some rough times at work with with uh this one machine and and we were trying to use Steam from the baller to clear these lines out like we normally do but you know it was right not even an hour before that we all made the statement man the day can't get no worse but the day can always get worse you know sitting there and trying to steam these lines out and and I was sitting there on this in us I thought for sure I seen wax flowing I began to say oh we good man we good we got wax flowing but when I was closing the Val I thought I was closing it but it wasn't closing it was opening and what we made was a bomb and the thing went off so bad I mean just like that and you ain't had time to react it just blowed up when it did I know it knocked me off my feet I mean I flew back and hit the hit the ground I hit my head before I hit the ground but when I hit the ground all I seen was like the cloud it was like a cloudy cloudy and I seen rain like rain but it was hot wax and all of it was dumping all on me so I'm thinking when I'm laying there on the floor it I just unbelievable I thought the myself this is about to be bad so I just didn't have the the reaction I guess the will to get up and run so I'm laying on the ground and my supervisor I guess and uh another guy they come and Drug me out cuz everybody took off running then they said they looked back and they saw I was still in there and they saw me laying on the ground so they come and Drug me out when they drove me out and they tried to they tried to sit me down well they set me down and uh they so wanted to take my shirt off but my shirt was stuck in my back and they cut it off and you know then all the pain started started feeling the realization of what happened but had to go to the hospital and all and you know that is such such a trauma and all that happened but they even be standing before you tonight aive well Hallelujah that's my testimony come on you know that thing it went all it happened so fast I thought to myself and I was telling charlet and all those I says that's why you got to be ready at all times I said you know imagine if you had something in your heart or you had some unconfessed sins or you had something you know that wasn't right and you thinking I'll have time to get it right see you're playing you know what I'm saying I didn't mean to say it like that but you're playing right because you don't know at any time God can call you home and you don't have time to make nothing right amen the Devil he's he's he he he's he's baiting sometimes people into that place to where you think I got time I'm be all right I'll be all right but you don't realize at any moment God can call you home and then when God calling you home what means everything what means anything when God calling you home how much money you got that ain't mean nothing come on the car you got the house you live in ain't mean a thing of God calling you home come on your name don't mean nothing if God calling you home how much people love you and all that only thing that makes a difference is if you right with God or not Hallelujah but I'm so glad that even in that time I felt as though that Lord if you calling me Lord I'm ready for you come on and that's what makes the the the world to you to know that God the Lord Lord shows us in a moment things can change but I says that Lord why wait to say I'm going to do better God I'm going to do better right now why wait to say I'm going get it right Lord I'm getting everything right right now because in the moment things can change could have been gone come on but the miracle Hallelujah I'm a walking Miracle before you tonight come on I'm a walking miracle I might have little aches and pains but I'm testifying about the goodness of God cuz things could have been worse could have lost my eyes Hallelujah they was amaz amazed I didn't lose my my eyes it didn't get in my eyes got all on my eyelashes and my eyelids and everything but didn't get in my eyes I said God thank you for my eyes Lord hallelujah the blast could have took my arms legs and all that off but I'm able to walk tonight Hallelujah I'm able to lift my hands and say Lord thank you tonight God I thank you for my limbs tonight Hallelujah come on I ain't worried about the pains and all yeah what do you have pain yes Hallelujah I ain't worri about my haircutting NE cuz I got part of my hair missing but that don't I'm a praise God anyhow I I've been telling everybody that that called me cuz everybody been calling me from the job I said I want y'all to go ahead and start telling my testimony cuz I'm a miracle I said if people don't believe in God tell them tell them my testimony because I'm a miracle Hallelujah everybody thought it was way worse than what it was and it should have been but the grace of God hallelujah the God of all Grace

when you talk about come on people playing like I said we sometime people playing with God grace amen they playing with it amen but God's grace God God humble yourselves before the mighty hand of God anytime God can change things if you want to but it's his grace you know I look at the blessings that God blessed me with as I was walking the other day in the yard said God I don't know why you blessed me so much you blessed me far above what I considered was my measure but God I thank you for your blessings anyhow I ain't never worthy or deserving of the blessings of God but I thank God for his blessings I thank God for his mercy and all of his grace I shouldn't have been here but God is good Hallelujah God Is Great Mighty to be praised I begin to tell the devil I says this might should have made me down and sad but the only thing it did was make me praise God tomor only thing it did was make me search my my own soul salvation with fear and trembling even the more to say God here I am God search me try me if you're trying to get my attention God I hear you Lord if you want me to tell somebody how real you are I do it God I do whatever you ask me to do hallelujah oh Jesus Jesus

blowed up but I wonder when the people would take it serious you know he said as it was in the days of lot and as it was in the days of Sodom and and as in the days of Noah so shall it be when did the people wake up I believe they wake they woke up when the rain start falling I said when the Great Tribulation start setting in I believe that's when people say well I I want you God lord I need the Holy Ghost I want it I believe that that's the rain start falling somebody said they knocked on the one and they knocked on the door I don't believe they could reach it I believe God had his angels there praise God and I believe that they couldn't get in then one day he's going to rise up and he's going to shut through the door the door would be shut the door for the Gentiles would be shut
