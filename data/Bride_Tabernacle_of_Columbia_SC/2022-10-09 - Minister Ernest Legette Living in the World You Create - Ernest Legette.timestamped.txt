[44:40] troubled for this thing and he called
[44:42] his servants and said unto them will ye
[44:45] not show me which of us is for the king
[44:47] of Israel no and and one of the servants
[44:51] said none my Lord O King but Elisha the
[44:54] prophet that is in Israel telleth the
[44:57] king of Israel the words that thou
[44:59] speaketh in thy bed chamber and he said
[45:01] go and spy where he is that I may sin
[45:05] and fetch him and it was told him saying
[45:07] behold he's is in Dothan therefore sent
[45:10] he they're their horses and chariots and
[45:12] a great host and they came by night and
[45:14] compassed the city about and when the
[45:17] servant of the man of God was risen
[45:18] early and gone forth behold and hosts
[45:21] Compass the city both with horses and
[45:24] chariots and his servants said unto him
[45:26] alas my master how shall we do and he's
[45:30] answered fear not for they that be with
[45:34] us are more than they that be with them
[45:36] and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray
[45:40] thee open his eyes that he may see and
[45:43] the Lord opened the eyes of the young
[45:45] man and he saw and behold the mountain
[45:48] was full of horses and Chariots of Fire
[45:52] round about Elisha may God had blessed
[45:54] to the reading of his words you may be
[45:56] seated this morning
[45:58] God is good amen we want to minister
[46:01] this morning on living in a world that
[46:04] you create amen
[46:06] living in a world that you create
[46:09] you know you know it's probably God's
[46:11] talking once he's saying that you know
[46:13] once you've been born again or you have
[46:16] an ounce of God in you it's enough power
[46:19] in you to create your own world
[46:21] and to go live there
[46:23] he says and if it wasn't a law against
[46:25] it the children of God would do that
[46:27] they would create their own world and go
[46:29] live a private life on it but that's how
[46:32] much power you and I are packing this
[46:34] morning you know once you've been born
[46:36] again the power that's in you you know
[46:40] but like you said it's got laws that
[46:42] govern that governs that power that's in
[46:45] you so we want to talk this morning
[46:47] about living in the world you created
[46:49] amen you know I was sharing with my son
[46:52] not long ago and I was telling him I
[46:54] said I want you to realize that you know
[46:57] this life is built upon choices
[46:59] and I says that you know the choices
[47:02] that you're making right now I can try
[47:04] to lead you in a way and teach you right
[47:06] from wrong but I say is that in in all
[47:09] when it comes down to the end it's going
[47:12] to be by your own choices and the
[47:13] choices that you make
[47:15] and I said you know I want you to think
[47:17] about where you are right now and I want
[47:20] you to if the Lord should tarry 10 years
[47:22] from now I want you to look at your life
[47:24] and where you find yourself but I want
[47:26] you to realize that wherever you find
[47:28] yourself at it's a result of the choices
[47:31] that you made
[47:32] come on that's what God makes us free
[47:34] moral agents he's not going to force us
[47:37] to do anything but he gives you a choice
[47:39] you know the children once had a
[47:41] question that says that if God already
[47:42] know everything then how can you have a
[47:45] choice I said God knows the beginning
[47:47] from the ending but even though he
[47:50] already knows he still he still allows
[47:52] you to make your own choices
[47:54] he doesn't Force she's still he still
[47:57] allows you to make your own choices and
[47:58] but he already know the beginning from
[48:01] the end and he already know what choice
[48:03] you'll make and that's why he could save
[48:06] you know Jacob have I love and he saw
[48:08] have I hate us before the children was
[48:10] even born why because he already know
[48:13] what choice they they would make that's
[48:15] why he can take your name and before the
[48:18] foundation of the world the lamb could
[48:20] already be slain and he can take your
[48:22] name and write it in the Lamb's Book of
[48:24] Life because he already knew what choice
[48:26] you'd make and sometimes if we look from
[48:29] the natural eye we'll see somebody in
[48:32] the position the way they are and we'll
[48:34] say there's no way that they can make it
[48:36] now I know they name ain't on the lamb
[48:39] Book of Life as we was teaching the
[48:41] other night we're talking about the
[48:42] wheat and the tears you could say I know
[48:43] that they're not a wheat but it's
[48:46] something about God God knows the
[48:48] beginning from the ending he don't judge
[48:50] a man by just where the condition where
[48:53] he is but he knows his thoughts
[48:55] concerning you and they're good and not
[48:57] evil he know how he saw you before the
[49:00] world began he know how he saw you way
[49:03] in his mind and if your name was written
[49:05] on the Lamb's Book of Life I don't care
[49:07] what kind of condition you are what kind
[49:09] of depths or a place where you are in
[49:11] your life what kind of change that the
[49:13] devil got hold on you come on when God
[49:16] began to call in on you those chains
[49:18] Can't Hold You When God began to calling
[49:20] on you conditions can't hold you nothing
[49:23] in this world can hold you when God
[49:24] begin to calling on you because what it
[49:26] is he bringing you forth that way you
[49:29] can manifest the image that he had of
[49:31] you in his mind and I'm so glad today
[49:34] that when we think about those things
[49:36] that when we were dead and trespassing
[49:39] sin come on and all these walked our way
[49:42] in times past but the Bible says but God
[49:45] who was a rich in Mercy where it is his
[49:48] love that he had towards us come on he
[49:51] already knew that in all those things he
[49:53] was going to be rich in Mercy he knew
[49:55] that one day and all of your sin one day
[49:58] you'd hear the voice of God and you'd
[50:00] want a way out Hallelujah he knew that
[50:02] deep down in your heart you would want
[50:04] him one day Hallelujah so he made
[50:07] provision to get you out of that place
[50:08] that you were in
[50:11] aren't you glad of that this morning
[50:12] come on you ever felt that way sometimes
[50:16] you know you look in your life and say
[50:18] that you know I always wanted to give my
[50:20] life to God but I just couldn't do it I
[50:23] always wanted to you know break free
[50:25] from the life that I was in but I I just
[50:28] couldn't seem to break free every time I
[50:31] tried you know it seemed like something
[50:33] was holding me back come on and it was
[50:35] it was demon powers but one day God
[50:38] looked down upon you Hallelujah and he
[50:41] saw those demons holding you but he
[50:44] began to call out in the spirit let him
[50:46] go Hallelujah and then no matter how
[50:49] much they tried to hold on you no matter
[50:51] how much they try to cry out for help he
[50:54] had no other choice but to let you go
[50:56] why because it was something drawing on
[50:58] you it was something pulling on you
[51:01] Hallelujah that was stronger than the
[51:04] thing that had you bound and you can
[51:06] come out and look back and say I know it
[51:08] was God that brought me Hallelujah I
[51:11] knew it was God that brought me from a
[51:13] mighty long way come on not by might nor
[51:16] by power but by his Spirit come on
[51:19] Hallelujah
[51:21] said I know it was God that brought me
[51:23] come on
[51:24] I like that song they were singing the
[51:26] other night with my savior found me and
[51:28] wrapped his arms All Around Me Oh the
[51:30] joy that came to me come on come on
[51:33] there's something about that you know
[51:35] they singing those songs but those are
[51:36] true songs those are real songs Amazing
[51:40] Grace how sweet the sound that saved a
[51:43] Wretch like Me I once was lost you might
[51:46] have didn't realize you were lost come
[51:48] on but you were lost come on and one day
[51:50] God found you come on and he showed you
[51:53] the way he didn't just tell you the way
[51:55] but he showed you the way he led you out
[51:57] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that this
[52:00] morning come on Hallelujah I said living
[52:03] in the world that you create we find
[52:05] that you know the where you at right now
[52:08] so saying that you know you created that
[52:12] world that you're living in come on the
[52:14] atmosphere around you remember you
[52:16] create the atmosphere around it if all
[52:18] you got is negativity though all the
[52:20] atmosphere is going to be negative
[52:21] around come on but you have the power
[52:24] and it lies in your tongue come on it's
[52:27] on your lips you got the power to change
[52:30] any circumstance to change the condition
[52:32] you got the power and to speak to the
[52:35] storm
[52:36] the wind and the waves that's in your
[52:38] life you got the power to speak to them
[52:40] you don't have to sit there and then I
[52:42] know it's raining I know it's pouring
[52:45] but you got the power in you to speak to
[52:47] that storm and that storm will have to
[52:50] obey the words that's coming out of your
[52:52] mouth why because it's not necessarily
[52:54] you got the power but God has given you
[52:57] the authority Hallelujah he said that if
[53:00] you say to the mountain be thou removed
[53:02] it'll have to do as you say God has
[53:05] given you the authority
[53:07] Hallelujah I said living in the world
[53:09] that you created this morning you know
[53:11] we were talking about the other day that
[53:13] says when you when when you by faith
[53:17] take the word into your heart come on by
[53:20] faith and put it and put it on your lips
[53:23] and begin to speak that word come on it
[53:27] says that that's deity speaking Every
[53:30] Mountain got to move Every Chain has to
[53:33] let go because you speaking it ain't you
[53:36] but it's God speaking and he's speaking
[53:39] what not some man-made Creed a dog not
[53:42] something that he just heard but
[53:43] speaking the word come on Heaven and
[53:46] Earth will pass away but his word can't
[53:48] pass away when you speak to that
[53:50] mountain it might you might not see it
[53:52] moving like we're saying it might just
[53:54] be one grain of sand at a time but
[53:57] nevertheless the mountain is moving you
[53:59] said how do you know the mountain is
[54:01] moving by faith has got to move because
[54:03] God says so Hallelujah and what God said
[54:07] it can't fail
[54:09] Hallelujah he said with his stripes you
[54:12] are healed the pain might get worse your
[54:16] body might get sicker but with his
[54:18] stripes Hallelujah
[54:20] oh the devil can't stand before that
[54:22] it's something about it the devil can't
[54:25] stand before the word he can stand
[54:27] before your church and Creed and all
[54:29] these things but he can't stand before
[54:31] the word now when the word comes that's
[54:34] it's settled then it's over with why
[54:37] because God Is Spoken Hallelujah the
[54:41] creator has spoken and it has to be
[54:44] hallelujah oh that gets me excited this
[54:47] morning you know it's something about it
[54:49] I shared a testimony all the time I says
[54:51] that always when I was in my worst uh
[54:54] situation across the roads or trials in
[54:57] life it never felt that God failed that
[55:00] God always gave me a word and that word
[55:03] didn't just come from somewhere but it
[55:05] always came sometimes as a scripture
[55:08] most of the time and that scripture been
[55:10] laying there all the time you read it
[55:12] all the time but it's something about in
[55:14] your time of need in your time of great
[55:18] trial in your time of person execution
[55:21] and heavy hardness and your darkest hour
[55:24] Hallelujah then when you read that word
[55:26] something about life came to it and it's
[55:30] no longer a scripture but not his life
[55:32] to you now it's something you holding on
[55:35] to Hallelujah now it's life between life
[55:38] and death I'm holding on to the word of
[55:40] God hallelujah that's all I got I'm
[55:43] holding on to it Hallelujah and that's
[55:46] something good to hold on to the word of
[55:48] God hallelujah you can hold on to a
[55:51] church you can hold on to Friendship
[55:52] come on but they'll failure but when you
[55:54] holding on to the word
[55:56] everybody else can forsake you know
[55:58] everything else can leave you but that
[56:00] word hallelujah that word of comfort you
[56:03] in the Midnight Hour that word is
[56:06] strengthened you Hallelujah that word
[56:07] will give you Joy Hallelujah when you're
[56:10] saying that word
[56:12] got the power to pick you up Hallelujah
[56:15] out of that place you in oh Jesus y'all
[56:19] believe that this morning I'm so excited
[56:21] about the word that's why the word got
[56:23] to be your absolute don't let nobody
[56:25] take the word away from you come on come
[56:28] on the word got to be your absolute I
[56:30] don't come on I don't need nothing to
[56:31] give me the word hallelujah some people
[56:34] look for the word plus come on I always
[56:37] talked about you know your natural body
[56:39] you know the older you get you got to
[56:42] start uh adding uh like vitamins and all
[56:45] kind of taking medication and stuff to
[56:47] to put back what your body ain't putting
[56:49] out or what the food ain't giving you
[56:51] you might have ate the same food when
[56:53] you were younger and all and you felt
[56:55] fine but now you got to start adding
[56:57] other things iron whatever to help your
[57:00] body out come on because what you eating
[57:02] ain't doing it for you no more but it's
[57:05] something about the word of God you'll
[57:06] never have to add nothing to it or take
[57:09] nothing away from I don't care how old
[57:11] you get we're gonna be enough come on
[57:13] it's gonna be enough to sustain you to
[57:16] keep your Hallelujah you ain't gonna
[57:18] never stop your growth but the word
[57:19] you're gonna keep growing and keep
[57:21] getting stronger and keep getting more
[57:24] faith upon Faith come on you're gonna
[57:26] keep being changed from Glory the glory
[57:28] why because it's the word hallelujah it
[57:31] gets sweeter and sweeter as a I
[57:34] want to love between my Lord and I come
[57:36] on I know I'm yelling at you this
[57:38] morning come on but God is so good it's
[57:42] something like Joy Bell's ringing down
[57:43] in your soul come on when you know that
[57:46] you got a revelation that that's what it
[57:48] is God give you the word hallelujah and
[57:51] that's enough
[57:52] come on I said living in the world that
[57:55] you created remember you know you got
[57:57] the power to change your situation come
[58:00] on it's on your lips
[58:02] you got the power to do that you know we
[58:04] see here in the scriptures that you know
[58:07] they were down and encamped about the
[58:09] enemy the enemy account the bottom and
[58:13] you know unless you got up I could see
[58:15] him that morning get up he knew that
[58:17] they that the people were accounting
[58:19] about him come on and the enemy was what
[58:22] looked like it was totally against him
[58:23] but I said living in the world that you
[58:25] create what world you living in this
[58:27] morning
[58:28] Alicia wasn't living in that world that
[58:31] reacted to what he saw
[58:32] or that what what he saw affected him
[58:35] come on oh that what he heard affected
[58:37] him he wasn't affected by these five
[58:39] senses because he wasn't living in that
[58:41] World come on so when he got up to him
[58:44] it was just a normal day but his servant
[58:47] began I could see fear gripping and
[58:49] serving heart why because of what he saw
[58:51] come on I see the enemy out there it
[58:54] looks like that we are defeated looks
[58:57] like we're about to be taken captive or
[58:59] maybe even killed because I'm looking at
[59:02] the enemy come on but I can see Alicia
[59:04] Hallelujah he wasn't living in that
[59:07] world but he was living in another world
[59:09] Hallelujah he was living in a world of
[59:11] Faith he said don't you worry about that
[59:14] don't you know that is more with us than
[59:17] it is with them hallelujah oh Jesus come
[59:21] on don't you know this morning that is
[59:23] more with us Emma that greater is he
[59:27] that's in you

[59:35] living in the carnal realm remember
[59:37] these carnal things are affection
[59:40] pain or Fiction come on sickness of
[59:43] affection amen come on finances or
[59:46] fiction
[59:47] wanted all these things in this world
[59:49] will affect you if that's the world you
[59:52] living in but he said that he took us
[59:55] and placed Us in Heavenly places I
[59:57] believe in those heavenly places you
[59:59] aren't affected by pain you aren't
[1:00:02] affected by finances you aren't affected
[1:00:05] by anything in this world in Heavenly
[1:00:07] places why because you know that all
[1:00:10] things are possible if you would only
[1:00:13] believe Hallelujah in Heavenly places
[1:00:15] where God is that's where I want to be
[1:00:18] oh geez

[1:00:22] difference where you are come on what

[1:00:29] them come on he says uh more is more
[1:00:31] with us than it is with them it's
[1:00:33] serving maybe looking at them saying you
[1:00:35] ain't seeing what I see come on but I
[1:00:38] could lie I can see Elisha telling them
[1:00:40] yes but you ain't seeing what I see

[1:01:42] on open their eyes God want to do
[1:01:44] something in the presence of your
[1:01:46] enemies when everybody else was
[1:01:48] discouraged the Bible says David
[1:01:50] encouraged himself in the Lord come on
[1:01:52] he said I ain't looking to man in all
[1:01:54] the armies they never saved me before
[1:01:56] but God saved me and what and if God
[1:01:59] saved me then he'll save me now there
[1:02:01] ain't no mountain too high come on ain't
[1:02:04] no valley too long ain't no test too
[1:02:07] hard that God can't bring us through if
[1:02:09] he did it then he can do it now
[1:02:11] Hallelujah I'm putting my trust in the
[1:02:14] Lord hallelujah I'm putting my trust in
[1:02:17] almighty God to bring me through

[1:02:51] on I believe that the fear was gone then
[1:02:53] come on the enemy was still there but
[1:02:56] the fear is gone now why the fear left
[1:02:59] because now he could see Hallelujah that

[1:11:20] living in but the devil got to begin to
[1:11:24] talking to them and trick them to come
[1:11:25] from behind that world from out of that

[1:11:58] Hallelujah but they didn't know that it
[1:12:01] was another world out there come on but

[1:15:03] world now that they created right
[1:15:05] wasn't it come on there's living in a
[1:15:08] world now where one son to kill the
[1:15:10] other because you're jealous of them
[1:15:12] are you living in the world now it's
[1:15:13] thieves and all these abandons and
[1:15:15] things brought in but yeah that's the
[1:15:17] world that they created right amen come
[1:15:20] on I say it's that what world are you
[1:15:23] living in I had so many examples this
[1:15:25] morning I thought about David Hallelujah
[1:15:28] him and what was the difference between
[1:15:31] him and Saul and the rest of Israel they
[1:15:33] were living in two different worlds
[1:15:35] come on Saul and them you know Israel
[1:15:38] they were living in the world that they
[1:15:40] created right
[1:15:41] you say how did they create that world
[1:15:42] because it was a time where God was
[1:15:45] their leader it was a time where God was
[1:15:48] their King but they didn't want God to
[1:15:50] be their King no more come on God will
[1:15:52] just use the prophet and he would speak
[1:15:54] the word give them the word and he said
[1:15:56] I'm gonna fight all your battles come on
[1:15:58] I'm gonna go out before you I'm Gonna Be
[1:16:00] Your Champion amen come on that's where
[1:16:02] they were living that's how they were
[1:16:03] living one time where God was fighting
[1:16:05] all the battles but then they came to a
[1:16:07] place where they didn't want to live in
[1:16:09] that place no more come on they wanted
[1:16:11] to venture out the Bible says that you
[1:16:13] know that we want a king like the other
[1:16:16] so we can be like the other nations come
[1:16:19] on don't you know what kind of world
[1:16:20] those other nations are living in don't
[1:16:23] you know the world those other nations
[1:16:24] are living in come on my judgment and
[1:16:27] wrath fell upon them
[1:16:29] come on because of the things that they
[1:16:30] did that's how that's the world they're
[1:16:33] living in come on where they subject to
[1:16:36] the Judgment of God Amen but where you
[1:16:38] are if you stay behind come on I like
[1:16:41] that little song I'm Gonna hide behind
[1:16:43] that old mountain
[1:16:44] come on Jesus is that mountain where the
[1:16:47] Chilly Winds Don't Blow come on the
[1:16:49] devil wants you to come from behind that
[1:16:51] mountain
[1:16:52] Hallelujah y'all believe that this
[1:16:54] morning come on but Israel and they
[1:16:58] found themselves they wanted the king
[1:16:59] but they didn't know Goliath was coming
[1:17:01] they didn't know in that world you had
[1:17:04] to fight your own battles they didn't
[1:17:06] know in that world you got a king now
[1:17:09] don't come to me let your king go out
[1:17:11] and fight Hallelujah but they didn't
[1:17:13] know that their King when he saw that
[1:17:15] giant he was gonna be scared amen that
[1:17:18] King come on that they wanted he saw
[1:17:20] that giant he wouldn't go out and fight
[1:17:22] him come on but it's something about if
[1:17:25] God would have still been their King
[1:17:26] there ain't no giant that God won't face
[1:17:29] there ain't no trial that God won't show
[1:17:32] up to Hallelujah he said fear not come
[1:17:35] on Imma Be Your battle ax
[1:17:38] come on Imma Be Your your War General
[1:17:40] fear not come on I'm a fight for you
[1:17:44] Hallelujah come on it was a time then
[1:17:47] God ain't afraid of nobody but you saw
[1:17:49] Saul knows what are you doing hiding all
[1:17:52] Israel trembling right
[1:17:54] they were they were they were feeling
[1:17:55] the effects of the world they were
[1:17:57] living in come on other places where
[1:17:59] they were living what me come on but I
[1:18:02] thank God he had a little boy come on
[1:18:04] back on the back side hurting some
[1:18:07] that he wasn't living in that world was
[1:18:09] he even though he was part of Israel he
[1:18:11] was living in a realm of faith
[1:18:13] he was living in a realm the way he took
[1:18:16] God at his word amen that he said it was
[1:18:18] we'll possess the gates of our enemy
[1:18:20] come on that I'll fight for you
[1:18:22] Hallelujah come on that no man will be
[1:18:25] able to stand before you all the days of
[1:18:27] your life come on as long as you keep my
[1:18:29] word and stay in it come on meditating
[1:18:31] it meditating it day and night he
[1:18:34] promised my fathers these things come on
[1:18:36] and I'm gonna take God at his word you
[1:18:38] had a little boy living in another world
[1:18:40] living in another realm a realm of faith
[1:18:44] but that went Bears Lions no matter what
[1:18:47] it was that boy wasn't stirred about
[1:18:49] that but he was living in another world
[1:18:52] that they can't do me no harm
[1:18:55] because the anointing is here because
[1:18:58] the presence of God is here because God
[1:19:01] is fighting for me Hallelujah I like how
[1:19:04] it says that the the lion whatever came
[1:19:07] and and took one uh sheep out of there
[1:19:10] but the Bible says that David said I
[1:19:13] went after him and I caught him about a
[1:19:15] beard I think about that little boy
[1:19:17] remember the Bible said he was a runny
[1:19:19] little small fellow come on but he went
[1:19:21] after that lion and caught him about a
[1:19:23] beard how close he had to be to that
[1:19:25] lion to grab him about a beard come on
[1:19:28] and slave but what was it it wasn't
[1:19:31] David and his strength of who he was but
[1:19:34] it was the anointing come on it was the
[1:19:36] promise of God it was the realm of faith
[1:19:39] that he was living in that there wasn't
[1:19:41] no child not and stand before where he
[1:19:44] was living at because it was faith amen
[1:19:47] hallelujah and he said that Goliath
[1:19:49] would be just as one of these right amen
[1:19:51] amen Paul I saw them didn't know what
[1:19:53] David was talking about he couldn't see
[1:19:55] they couldn't see what David saw because
[1:19:58] he was living in another place come on
[1:20:00] David went right out there didn't he I
[1:20:03] said what world are you living in this
[1:20:04] morning come on what world
[1:20:07] remember the world you're living in is

[1:21:11] faith come on why are you doubting for
[1:21:13] don't you know hallelujah oh Jesus I

[1:21:36] you know I was thinking about it and our
[1:21:39] child told sister Connie I was going to
[1:21:41] tell her testimony
[1:21:42] and I told her in something or how you
[1:21:45] know they said that of the hummingbird
[1:21:47] in the garage or something and says that
[1:21:50] brother Jeremiah hit him hit him with a
[1:21:53] fly SWAT or something
[1:21:55] and said that the bird they couldn't
[1:21:57] find them I think they said Josh found
[1:21:58] him and brought him brought him in the
[1:22:00] house and a little bird was well it must
[1:22:03] have been broke up and couldn't fly
[1:22:05] and she said why'd you hit the bird
[1:22:07] let's pray for him they say they told
[1:22:09] you you know you prayed for him so
[1:22:11] sister Connie say she took the bird in
[1:22:14] the hand and began to pray for the bird
[1:22:17] and said Lord would you heal this little
[1:22:19] bird so he could fly and she said don't
[1:22:21] you know that little bird took out took
[1:22:24] his wings and just flew right out of her
[1:22:25] hands man and I said that I was talking
[1:22:28] to brother Jeremiah about it last night
[1:22:30] he said it sure happened just like that
[1:22:32] brother she said well after she prayed
[1:22:34] that bird flew right out of her hand and
[1:22:37] I said the thing is I said don't you

[1:23:38] why because it's things coming on the
[1:23:40] world that the medical world nobody
[1:23:42] don't can't deal with so we're gonna
[1:23:43] have to live in that place we're going
[1:23:45] to have to find find that place of Faith
[1:23:48] as I was sharing with the people I said
[1:23:50] you know when us when our face swelling
[1:23:53] up I sat in the car after I got out of

[1:23:58] God they just stretch they just grabbing
[1:24:00] right now they don't know what's wrong
[1:24:02] with me I said but God you know exactly
[1:24:04] what's wrong with me I said it ain't
[1:24:06] nothing but demons and Devils come on
