[31:18] Let us all bow our heads.
[31:22] Lord, we thank you for being in your
[31:24] house tonight, Lord. One more time.
[31:26] Lord, we thank you for your goodness,
[31:27] your grace, and your mercy, Lord. Lord,
[31:30] you gave us two legs to walk, two hands
[31:32] to clap, and Lord, a mouth to open to
[31:34] give you all the honor and the glory and
[31:36] the praise. Lord, we thank you for your
[31:38] anointing. Lord, you said when two or
[31:40] three are gathered in my name, there you
[31:42] would be in our midst, Lord. Lord, we
[31:44] ask that you come down, Lord, and move
[31:46] us out of the way that you may get all
[31:48] the glory, all the honor, the praise,
[31:50] Lord. Lord, meet all the needs, Lord.
[31:52] You know what's on every heart, Lord. Go
[31:54] and touch those that are here and those
[31:56] that are not here. In Jesus name we
[31:58] pray.
[31:59] Amen.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[32:05] turn to a familiar scripture. We're
[32:07] going to go to Exodus
[32:09] chapter
[32:12] [Music]
[32:13] Exodus chapter 14,
[32:20] man. How many glad to be in the house of
[32:22] the Lord tonight? Amen. Amen.
[32:38] If I think it's correctly, we're going
[32:40] to start in verse 10. But let me turn to
[32:42] it.
[32:50] Exodus 14 and we'll start in the 10th
[32:52] verse.
[32:56] And it reads when you got it. Say amen.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; And it reads, "And Pharaoh drew nigh.
[33:02] The children of Israel lifted up their
[33:04] eyes,
[33:06] and behold, the Egyptians marched after
[33:08] them. And they were so afraid. And the
[33:11] children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
[33:14] And they said unto Moses, because there
[33:17] were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken
[33:20] us away to die in the wilderness?
[33:23] Wherefore hast thou dwelt thus with us
[33:26] to carry us forth out of Egypt?
[33:30] Is not is not this the word that we did
[33:34] tell thee in Egypt, saying, "Let us
[33:36] alone that we may serve the Egyptians,
[33:39] for it have it have been better for us
[33:42] to serve the Egyptians than that we
[33:44] should die in the wilderness." And Moses
[33:47] said unto the people, "Fear ye not.
[33:50] Stand still and see the salvation of the
[33:52] Lord, which he will show to you today.
[33:55] For the Egyptians whom ye have seen
[33:57] today, ye shall not ye shall see them
[34:01] again no more forever. The Lord shall
[34:04] fight for you and ye shall hold your
[34:06] peace." Amen. God bless the reading of
[34:08] his word. You may be seated.
[34:12] Tonight I'd like to speak on a little
[34:13] topic that I entitled fear not.
[34:17] Fear not. And I a subtopic that I have
[34:20] tonight is God has given us the victory.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; God has given us the victory. And I
[34:27] wanted to read this because I was
[34:29] reminded of this story when everything
[34:32] looked against the children of Israel.
[34:35] God had done a mighty work to this point
[34:37] and he had brought them out of the He
[34:40] had brought them out of Egypt. But the
[34:41] story wasn't over. The journey wasn't
[34:44] over. And many times when God does
[34:46] something great for us, we think that we
[34:48] have arrived. We have come to a status
[34:50] in God that we can just expect a roll in
[34:53] victory for forever. But that's not how
[34:55] it works. Because sometimes God is still
[34:58] trying to mold you and work on you to
[35:00] elevate you to go higher. See it the
[35:03] coming out of Egypt wasn't the promised
[35:05] land. He didn't want them to stop there.
[35:07] So he had to send test and trial to make
[35:09] them move and get them out of their
[35:11] comfort zone. And sometimes that's what
[35:13] God will do in our lives is he'll send
[35:15] something in our lives to move us out of
[35:17] our comfort zone. Because sometimes we
[35:20] get settled in where we are. We get
[35:22] settled in what we're doing. We get
[35:24] satisfied with where we are. I got this
[35:26] job. I'm making this money. But
[35:28] sometimes God will let you get laid off
[35:30] to give you a better job. Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; He allowed God to double your salary
[35:33] than the salary that you had before. But
[35:36] only through after the test and the
[35:37] trial that you saw what God could do.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Only through the test and the trial that
[35:42] you had to realize that you couldn't be
[35:44] afraid of what was going to come next.
[35:46] You couldn't be afraid of how the
[35:48] journey was going to end. You just had
[35:49] to trust God.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; And see, when you understand that God
[35:52] has given you the victory, you don't
[35:54] have to be afraid. You don't have to you
[35:57] don't have to worry about it. You said,
[35:59] "Lord, I give it to you." And that
[36:00] settles it.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; See, see Moses, he was going back to God
[36:05] and said, "Lord, they they coming back
[36:07] to complaining with me, but Lord, you
[36:08] sent me here. Lord, you sent me to
[36:11] deliver them out of Egypt. So, you got
[36:13] to complete the work. I don't know how
[36:15] you going to do it. I don't know what
[36:16] you're going to do, but I know that
[36:18] you're going to do it. You wouldn't have
[36:19] brought them this far if you wasn't
[36:21] going to lead them all the way.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have took them this far if
[36:24] you wasn't going to take them all the
[36:25] way in."
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes we get we we we lose
[36:30] sight of where the goal is.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we lose sight that there's a
[36:34] promised land that we that was given to
[36:36] us. There's a promised land that we have
[36:38] to go to. But this is just a part of the
[36:41] journey.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; And when you own this journey, sometimes
[36:44] the journey get rough and you can only
[36:46] see the trial that's right in front of
[36:47] you.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; They done forgot about all the wonderful
[36:50] riches and all the things that was in
[36:52] the promised land cuz all they could see
[36:54] was Pharaoh army. And sometimes we got
[36:57] to just stop looking back.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Because Pharaoh army was behind them.
[37:01] But guess what was between them and
[37:03] Pharaoh's army was the angel of the Lord
[37:05] and the pillar of cloud.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; See, there was something that was
[37:08] standing between them and the enemy that
[37:10] was trying to get them. But if you so
[37:12] worried looking back, you'll never see
[37:14] the progress that God is trying to take
[37:16] you forward. You'll never understand
[37:18] that God has parted the Red Sea.
[37:20] Eventually, they had to turn around to
[37:22] see the salvation of the Lord. They had
[37:24] to turn around and see, you know what?
[37:26] There's a path that leads right on out
[37:28] of my situation. There's a path that God
[37:30] has made that I wouldn't have understood
[37:32] unless I had seen it with my own eyes. I
[37:35] wouldn't have understood unless God has
[37:36] showed it to me. And it might not have
[37:38] seen to anybody else. He said, "Moses,
[37:41] you speak." He told Moses to speak
[37:43] because it there was power in what he
[37:46] had to say. Because he had the authority
[37:48] of heaven back in what he had to say. It
[37:51] wasn't what he had to say, but he was
[37:52] trusting in God that what he spoke would
[37:54] come to pass. He was trusting in God
[37:56] that what he spoke, God was going to
[37:58] move in this situation and he was going
[38:00] to deliver them.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; And many of times we have to be careful
[38:04] what we speak.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said life and death is
[38:08] in the power of the tongue.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; And it said out of the heart the mouth
[38:11] speaketh. So sometimes you got to see
[38:13] what's in your heart.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz some things won't come out of you
[38:16] unless they inside of you. And some
[38:19] things God will take you through a
[38:20] situation to show you what's inside of
[38:22] you. What's inside of you. And you can't
[38:25] be afraid. Cuz if God is showing you,
[38:27] he's showing you that there's some more
[38:29] that I got to clean up. There's some
[38:31] more I got to take out of you. There's
[38:33] some more. There's a deeper walk that I
[38:35] want to take you to. There's a closer
[38:37] walk that I want to bring you to because
[38:39] in my presence, there's no evil thing.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; When you get in the presence of God, you
[38:43] realize there's certain things you can't
[38:45] do. Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; When you get in the presence of God,
[38:47] there's certain things you can't say.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; And it's not that you don't want to say,
[38:51] you can't say them. You can't. The God
[38:54] has done brightened your tongue that you
[38:55] can't say those things.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we might get afraid and
[38:59] say, "Lord, I want you to be with me."
[39:01] But I would stop you from doing a lot of
[39:02] things. Cuz when God is with you, you
[39:05] can't go certain places.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; You can't be in certain atmospheres. You
[39:09] can't have certain conversations because
[39:11] God is right there with you. Not only
[39:13] that, God has stopped others around you
[39:15] from having those conversations with you
[39:18] because they can't do it. They don't
[39:20] even understand why they couldn't do it.
[39:22] They can they cannot talk to you and
[39:24] turn their back to you and have this the
[39:26] conversation that they want to have
[39:27] right next to the next person. Why? Cuz
[39:30] God was with you. God was right there.
[39:32] See, he had to get them to a point that
[39:34] they couldn't be afraid. They couldn't
[39:36] be afraid that that what God was going
[39:39] to do because he was going to deliver
[39:40] them out of them all. He spoke to Moses.
[39:43] He said, "This enemy that you see today,
[39:45] you'll never see him again."
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And God, when he said, "You'll never see
[39:50] it again." That was the end of the
[39:52] empire in history.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; God deleted them out of the rest of
[39:56] history. He said, "That's the end."
[39:58] &gt;&gt; That's what God does when he when he
[40:00] takes care of your enemies, he does it
[40:02] in such a way that you don't have to
[40:04] worry about it again.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, that's what God wants you
[40:08] to step out in faith and take with his
[40:11] word. And don't be afraid. Don't be
[40:13] afraid that God has got you in the place
[40:15] that he's got you, cuz he's got you
[40:17] there for a reason.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; He's got you there because he's taking
[40:20] you somewhere else. This is just a stop.
[40:23] It's not the end of your journey. So,
[40:25] you can't get bogged down and let the
[40:26] devil keep you down in the space that
[40:29] you're in cuz God is trying to take you
[40:31] somewhere else.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Amen.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, he said
[40:38] he was talking he was talking about this
[40:40] story and he said
[40:48] he said
[40:50] he said
[40:56] now they had come out through and got
[40:59] and notice the blood redemption brought
[41:01] them out of Egypt. Now they had to have
[41:04] something else now to take them on over
[41:07] into the land. Now they just beginning
[41:09] to start. They had just come out, been
[41:12] circumcised, come under the blood and on
[41:15] and on the march. Now they got up to
[41:18] something. They were going along there
[41:19] knowing that they had passed from death
[41:21] unto life, knowing they had eternal
[41:23] life. But they here they are coming up
[41:27] now and difficult begins and difficult
[41:29] begins to rise. Here comes fable.
[41:32] Pharaoh's army pursuing them to take
[41:34] them. Trouble sets in. See, many of
[41:37] times we get to a point in God that
[41:39] we'll have this happen and God delivers
[41:41] us and we have this happen, but the
[41:43] devil don't stop. I was telling someone
[41:46] that this is something happened to me
[41:48] and I said and I and I and then I
[41:50] something and then I started having a
[41:52] few bad days and because that happens to
[41:55] you if you live life long enough, you're
[41:57] going to have a few bad days. And so I
[42:00] had a few rough days and I said I went
[42:02] back and told him I said I should have
[42:04] known the devil was coming
[42:07] because the days before that was real
[42:08] real good days. And I said I should have
[42:11] known the devil was coming. I should
[42:13] have been aware that the enemy was
[42:15] coming to fight me. I should have been
[42:17] aware that the enemy was coming. He was
[42:19] right on. He was seeing what God was
[42:20] doing. He was like God, can I go? Can I
[42:22] go?
[42:24] And not only that, you have to be aware
[42:26] that when things are going good, the
[42:27] enemy is still right there cuz he's
[42:29] seeing the hedge that God is putting
[42:31] around you
[42:32] &gt;&gt; and say, and God is going to allow him
[42:34] to test you.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; He going to allow him to try you. He
[42:37] going to allow him to say, "Hey, hey,
[42:40] are you going to fall or you not going
[42:41] to fall?" I said, "I should have known
[42:43] the devil was coming." Cuz some and
[42:46] sometimes in those moments, you forget
[42:48] all about the victory. You forget all
[42:51] about what God just brought you through.
[42:53] You you you you don't see that no more
[42:55] cuz you in that moment. And the moment
[42:58] is a is a sorrowful moment. Sometimes
[43:00] it's a heavy moment. Sometimes it's a
[43:02] depressed moment. Sometimes an anxiety
[43:04] moment. It's many moments that you might
[43:07] be in. But when God deliver you, he
[43:09] deliver you from them all.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now listen, God is our refuge
[43:14] and our strength, a very present help in
[43:16] the time of trouble." Oh, I hope you see
[43:19] that. See that?
[43:20] And he said, he said, "And Moses said
[43:23] unto the people," I love that that Jesus
[43:26] rose from the dead and his words was
[43:28] constantly, "Fear not." All throughout
[43:31] the Bible, you will see where no matter
[43:33] when the situation, whenever God shows
[43:36] up on the scene, he always said, "Fear
[43:37] not."
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Whenever he sent an angel, he said,
[43:40] "Fear not." There has to be something
[43:42] there because he doesn't want you to be
[43:45] afraid of his presence. Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to be afraid of him
[43:49] showing up on the scene. He doesn't want
[43:51] you to be afraid that what you asked
[43:53] for, he's about to do.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; He wants you to step out and say, "You
[43:56] know what? This is the God that I serve
[43:58] and exactly what he said he's going to
[43:59] do, he going to do it."
[44:01] &gt;&gt; And it's just that simple. Sometimes it
[44:03] takes the faith of a mustard seed to
[44:05] move the mountain.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; That's all it takes. And sometimes we
[44:08] making it this big complicated thing and
[44:11] oh, I got to see this happen and this
[44:12] happen. But all you have to do is
[44:14] believe.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. All you have to do is step out and
[44:17] say, "Lord, I'm not afraid no more."
[44:20] &gt;&gt; That devil that's been testing me, I'm
[44:21] not afraid of them no more. That trial
[44:23] that's I've been going through, I'm not
[44:25] afraid of it no more. That person I've
[44:27] been praying about, I'm not afraid of
[44:28] what you going to do in their life.
[44:30] Lord, I'm not afraid of how you going to
[44:32] do it. Cuz when you work, you going to
[44:33] work it just right like you supposed to.
[44:38] said, "I was going through a situation
[44:40] and I had prayed about it and I prayed
[44:42] for this person and I said, "God, I I
[44:45] got to the point that you can care so
[44:47] much that you have to say, Lord, your
[44:49] will be done."
[44:51] &gt;&gt; And then when they start going through
[44:52] the situation, you be ready to try to
[44:55] block that prayer like, "Lord, don't let
[44:58] it happen that way. Lord, don't let it
[45:00] happen that way." And God had to tell
[45:02] me, he said it, "You pray for their
[45:05] soul. You prayed for their heart. Now,
[45:09] don't be afraid of how I take them
[45:11] through it. Now, don't be scared of how
[45:14] I let them go through it because that's
[45:16] what they need to if that's what they
[45:17] need to get to where they need to get
[45:19] to, I got to let them go through it. And
[45:22] God had to stop me. I said, you know,
[45:24] I'm going to pray your will be done.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pray that your will be done
[45:27] cuz that's the only prayer that I can
[45:29] pray. I don't want to block God from
[45:31] doing the work that he's doing if that's
[45:32] the work that he got to do. Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; And I said, "All I believe in is that
[45:37] trust that God is going to do what he
[45:38] said he going to do."
[45:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "I never lost one." So if he
[45:42] ain't never lost one, I can hold on and
[45:45] stand on that. I can trust God for it
[45:47] and I can move in faith on it. I don't
[45:50] have to be afraid of what's going to
[45:51] happen because it's all going to turn
[45:53] out for their good. It's going to turn
[45:55] out for my good. So I can release this
[45:57] burden. I can let the stress go. I can
[46:00] let all these things go because God is
[46:02] working it for the good.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I said I I don't have to be afraid of
[46:08] what's going to happen no more.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; I I can go to sleep in peace.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about it no more.
[46:15] And the burdens that I'm carrying, I got
[46:17] to take them to the Lord and leave them
[46:18] there.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; And and when I walk away, not pick them
[46:21] up no more.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Said that's been a prayer, a constant
[46:24] prayer I've been praying. Lord, don't
[46:25] let me pick up the burden.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; You took it from me. Now don't let me
[46:29] pick it up again.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Because you don't sometimes you don't
[46:33] even realize the effect of the burdens
[46:34] that you carry.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; You don't even realize how much it may
[46:38] weigh to you and and take you through
[46:40] things in your daily and personal life
[46:42] because you carrying someone else's
[46:44] burden.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; That ain't yours.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And sometime God just trying to show
[46:48] you, hey, let it go.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Let it go. Let it go. And taking you
[46:53] through ups and downs. So to let it go,
[46:56] let it go. And you still struggling.
[46:58] Well, Lord, I really can't you.
[47:00] Sometimes you can't be afraid and just
[47:01] say, "Lord, let it I let it go."
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And and whatever you got to do, you got
[47:06] to do it because it's what I asked you
[47:09] for.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; It's what I prayed for. It's what I what
[47:12] I leaned on you for. And that's what you
[47:14] said. The song says Jesus said, "Let me
[47:17] lean on you."
[47:18] &gt;&gt; See, cuz I got to lean on you cuz I
[47:20] can't carry the burden.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; I can't do it. The devil is fighting me
[47:23] enough to be fighting for somebody else.
[47:25] I can stand in the gap and pray. That's
[47:28] all that I can do is pray
[47:30] &gt;&gt; and pray that God, hey, you have your
[47:32] perfect will in your perfect way. And he
[47:34] said, and I love that. And Jesus rose
[47:37] from the dead and his words constantly
[47:38] was, "Fear not."
[47:41] And that's what the trouble with the
[47:42] church is today is scared to death,
[47:45] you're going to make a failure. How many
[47:47] times did God bring you through
[47:49] something and you scared that you're
[47:50] going to go back and do the same thing
[47:52] he brought you through?
[47:54] He said, "Many of times we're scared.
[47:56] You're going to you're scared to death
[47:58] you're going to make a failure. How can
[48:00] you fail when you're in Christ?"
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; You can't fail.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've got everlasting life.
[48:08] All demons in hell can't shake you.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; You've got eternal everlasting life."
[48:15] Jesus said so. So don't be scared of
[48:17] failure.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Many of times we are scared. We scared
[48:21] to take the next step cuz we scared that
[48:23] we're going to fail. We're scared that
[48:26] what whatever God has told us to do, we
[48:28] scared that we not going to be able to
[48:30] accomplish it. But if God told you to do
[48:33] it,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; you can't be afraid of what God told you
[48:37] to do.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; It's not for you to figure out. It's not
[48:40] for you to work out. It's all for you
[48:42] just to trust and believe and do what he
[48:44] told you to do. And I can't tell you
[48:46] what God has told you to do. Cuz each
[48:48] one of us have a purpose and a will for
[48:51] God to do in our lives. We have a
[48:53] purpose that God want to show forth. He
[48:55] wants to work in our lives. He wants to
[48:57] use us. He wants to mold us and shape us
[49:00] that we can be those vessels that he can
[49:01] pour into and he can let the overflow
[49:04] that those around us can be blessed by
[49:06] the things that God is doing in our
[49:07] lives.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Said, but you can't don't be scared of
[49:14] failure.
[49:15] Many of times a lot of people don't
[49:17] achieve a lot of things because they are
[49:19] afraid of failure.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; It's just like the man in the Bible with
[49:23] the talents. He was so afraid of losing
[49:26] his one talent. He went and buried it.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Many of times God has given us so many
[49:32] wonderful gifts, so many precious gifts,
[49:35] but we don't we we afraid to use them
[49:37] because we don't know how it's going to
[49:39] turn out.
[49:40] We we we we afraid to let God use those
[49:44] gifts and talents because we don't want
[49:45] to be used in this way or we don't want
[49:47] God to use us in that way. You know,
[49:49] that might just put too much exposure on
[49:51] us. I had a friend that was praying. He
[49:54] said, "Lord, he he was talking about it
[49:56] and I had to tell him, man, you you you
[49:58] asking God to use you, but then you
[50:01] saying God only use me this way, this
[50:02] way, and this way." See, you're putting
[50:05] limitations on the prayer that you just
[50:06] prayed.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if that's how God want to use
[50:09] you, you you that that that's that got
[50:12] to be your desire. If that's your true
[50:13] heart's desire, if you asking God, Lord,
[50:17] I I want you to allow me to be a
[50:18] witness. Well, God will put people in
[50:21] your life that you can witness to. And
[50:23] sometimes it may not be by your words.
[50:25] It's by the life that you living.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; You never know how many people you if
[50:30] God allows us to when we get over there,
[50:32] they'll come up and say, "Hey, I only
[50:34] made it because the life you was living.
[50:38] I only get I only came to know who God
[50:40] was because the life that you was
[50:41] living.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; I know I ain't never say nothing to you,
[50:45] but your life was a testimony to me that
[50:48] there was something. There was a God
[50:50] that was real.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; When you was telling those testimonies
[50:53] at work, it was a God that was real. I
[50:55] knew there was a difference between
[50:57] everybody else and you. See, there has
[50:59] to be a difference between everybody
[51:01] else and you.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, then what's the difference
[51:04] between God and the devil? Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; There has to be a right and there has to
[51:09] be a wrong.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Even though society now is blurring the
[51:13] lines.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; But there is a right and there is a
[51:17] wrong. There has to be something that
[51:19] you standing on that you know is true.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; There has to be something that you know
[51:23] deep down in the inside that checks you
[51:25] that you know that is different than
[51:27] you.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; That points out that what is good and
[51:31] what's not.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; What what is right and what is wrong.
[51:34] Amen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And you have to listen to that voice.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to hear the voice. It's
[51:39] another thing to listen to that voice
[51:41] and obey the voice.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Many people might hear it, but a lot of
[51:46] people ain't listening.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; And many people they listening, but they
[51:49] ain't doing no actions behind it.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; God want us to act on what he's given
[51:54] us.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; God want us to move in the direction
[51:57] that he's caused us and told us to move.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Let me get down here.
[52:05] He said, "That's good. Just march on.
[52:07] Don't get scared about nothing. If
[52:09] you've accepted Christ as your savior,
[52:11] go on." And he said, someone asked,
[52:14] "Brother Brandon, I want the baptism of
[52:16] the Holy Ghost." He said, "Just keep
[52:18] moving. Don't fear. You say, I'm sick
[52:20] now, brother Brandham. I can't get much
[52:22] further. Don't worry. Just keep on
[52:24] moving. See the salvation of the Lord.
[52:27] Accept it. Just move on." And said, "How
[52:30] is it going to be? The doctor turned me
[52:32] down." Now, the fella done the best that
[52:34] he could, but God hasn't done his best
[52:36] yet.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Just a moment. Listen at
[52:39] him. All right.
[52:42] [Applause]
[52:43] And he said that the Lord shall fight
[52:45] for you and ye shall and ye shall and ye
[52:48] shall hold your peace. He said,
[52:55] see, God is sometimes taking us through
[52:58] things to show forth his his handiwork.
[53:01] He's taking us through things so that we
[53:04] our faith can be elevated. Cuz at some
[53:06] point in time, you got to have a faith
[53:08] that God can translate your body.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; You got to have faith that God can
[53:12] transition, take you straight on out of
[53:14] this world. Just like Enoch, he walked
[53:16] so close with God that one day God just
[53:18] took him on.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; But do you have the faith to believe
[53:21] that one day I'm going to step out of
[53:22] this dimension into that dimension? I'm
[53:25] going to step right on out of here into
[53:27] where into the presence of God. Do you
[53:30] have that faith yet? And if not, God
[53:32] might be taking you through things to
[53:34] build your faith to get you there, get
[53:36] you there. And it's and you wonder why
[53:39] you going through test after test after
[53:40] test cuz you don't have that much time.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; In other times and seasons, they might
[53:46] have had many, many years to get ready.
[53:49] But when times is eluding us, every day
[53:51] the days are getting shorter. So God got
[53:55] to speed up the process to take you
[53:57] through stuff because he's trying to get
[53:59] you to the point that you can be
[54:00] raptured out of here. He's trying to get
[54:03] you to the point that you no longer
[54:04] afraid of nothing because God has all in
[54:07] control. And not only that, you can
[54:09] stand on it. You you have no wavering
[54:12] faith on it. That whatever God is
[54:13] putting in front of you, he going to
[54:15] take you through it. And he's going to
[54:16] deliver you out of it. And he's going to
[54:18] take it to the point that you can speak
[54:20] and it will be. You going to take it to
[54:22] the point that you can be here and be
[54:25] there because God has translated you
[54:27] there.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; See, God has allowed us and taken us
[54:31] through these things that they can be
[54:33] testimonies, but to elevate your faith
[54:35] to the point that one day you can
[54:36] translate on out of here.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That you can be ready to say, Lord, hey,
[54:42] if if it be, Lord, let it be. And it
[54:44] shall be. And that's why the the the
[54:48] squeeze may come, but you won't be
[54:50] afraid of it.
[54:51] They may shut this down and they might
[54:53] cause this to go down that you may not
[54:56] be able to get food but by that time
[54:58] you'll be able to speak it and and it'll
[55:00] be there because you have such a faith
[55:02] that God that the impossible is possible
[55:06] that that that God is the God of the
[55:08] impossible and with him there's nothing
[55:10] that can't be done with him there's
[55:13] nothing that is impossible and I have
[55:15] such a faith that God can do anything
[55:17] more than exceeded abundantly more than
[55:19] I can even ask or think that I can just
[55:22] go ahead and just believe God and just
[55:23] let it be.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; I can believe God and just let it
[55:26] happen. Lord, I don't have to be afraid
[55:28] no more that you can deliver cuz I seen
[55:30] you do it enough for me just to accept
[55:32] it on faith. I don't have to believe
[55:34] that you can say cuz I seen you do it
[55:36] enough. It doesn't matter how low the
[55:38] person is. God can bring them out. It
[55:41] doesn't matter what they going through,
[55:42] God can bring them out. See, I got a
[55:44] faith now to trust God in anything and
[55:47] everything because of what God is doing.
[55:49] I have a faith now to believe that God
[55:51] can move the mountain. I don't even have
[55:53] to see it move. I know that God is
[55:55] moving the mountain. See, that's the
[55:57] different time you when you start to get
[55:59] to that level, your your your speech
[56:01] changes. Your speech changes because you
[56:04] realize how real God is. That he's
[56:07] sitting right next to you and the God
[56:09] isn't a far off in heaven above. He's
[56:11] right here with me. And I don't have to
[56:13] go far to touch him. I can just reach
[56:15] out and he's reaching out to me. I can
[56:17] believe that he's right here cuz I know
[56:19] he's right here. He said when two or
[56:21] three are gathered in my name there, he
[56:23] would be in the midst. So if I'm here
[56:25] and you're here, God is here.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not afraid no more to speak as
[56:31] it shall be.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Because he gave me the power and the
[56:35] authority to to do that.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; He said, if I be in you and you be in
[56:39] me, ask what you will and I'll do it.
[56:41] Amen. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be afraid to to ask God
[56:44] for the things that he said he shall
[56:46] supply all my needs. So if it's a need,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; I can speak it and it'll be cuz he said
[56:53] that he would do it.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not afraid no more when the
[56:58] devil comes to knock on my door.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Because I know that he defeated him at
[57:04] Calvary.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know that once you recognize and
[57:07] God open your eyes that you can see that
[57:10] the who is with you is greater than the
[57:12] enemy that's coming against you.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; You can hey your speech will change
[57:17] already. When you realize that the God
[57:20] that's with you is greater than all the
[57:22] host of the the devil and all the enemy
[57:24] put together.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; See when see when the devil was kicked
[57:28] out of heaven only a third of the angels
[57:29] was kicked out. So there was still
[57:32] twothirds that was up there that was
[57:33] serving God. Amen.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; And the difference was the devil can't
[57:37] create nothing, but God can.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; So if God wanted more, he could he can
[57:42] create more at any given time. He could
[57:45] have created a new a new more angels to
[57:47] replace the ones that that he lost. But
[57:50] you see, God is able to do these things.
[57:53] And he just wants us to tap in and say,
[57:55] "Lord, I believe in what you can do.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm no longer afraid in what you
[58:01] what you're able to do for me. Lord, I
[58:03] know you've done it for sister and
[58:05] brother, but God, I now I got faith to
[58:07] stand for myself. Lord, I got faith to
[58:10] believe for myself that you can do what
[58:12] you said you would do for me.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; I I'm not looking at anybody else cuz
[58:17] they faith can't can't they can't move
[58:20] the mountains in my life.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; They can pray for it, but sometimes I
[58:24] got to I got to believe for myself.
[58:27] Sometimes I got to get down and get on
[58:29] my knees and say, "Lord, I need you to
[58:31] move this mountain in my life." Some
[58:33] some mountains in your life, nobody
[58:35] knows about it, but you and God. Nobody
[58:38] knows what you're going through, but you
[58:39] and God. And you got to get down and
[58:41] say, "Lord, I need you to do the work in
[58:43] my life." And and it's only going to be
[58:45] a testimony of what you're capable of
[58:48] doing. It's only a testimony of what
[58:50] you're able to do. Do do it do because
[58:54] of your word.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:56] I was reading something and it said, he
[58:59] said, "You're always pointing how wicked
[59:02] the world is getting, but you failed to
[59:05] see how powerful the church is getting.
[59:08] At the same time, she's rising up,
[59:11] standing on the field. Oh, she's a
[59:13] little flock, but brother, God is with
[59:15] her, and she's going to triumph just as
[59:18] certain as Christ rose from the dead."
[59:21] Amen. God's church shall never fail. The
[59:24] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[59:26] it. Show that they would be against it,
[59:29] but they cannot prevail. The church is
[59:32] going to triumph through the blood of
[59:34] Jesus Christ with a victory march. I'm
[59:36] positive of this one thing that God will
[59:39] have a church without spot, wrinkle, or
[59:43] blemish. Amen. And I'm I'm so happy
[59:45] about it. See, the gates of hell will
[59:48] not prevail. He said they might be
[59:49] against it but they cannot prevail
[59:52] because there's something standing
[59:54] against them and you and that's the
[59:56] blood of Jesus. And if you are not under
[59:59] the blood you need to get under the
[1:00:01] blood. You need to get there like like
[1:00:04] yesterday because tomorrow is not
[1:00:07] promised to you. Tomorrow is not
[1:00:09] something you can guarantee. Because if
[1:00:11] we could guarantee tomorrow, listen,
[1:00:14] many of people will be coming to you and
[1:00:15] giving you every dime in their pocket if
[1:00:17] you could guarantee them one more one
[1:00:19] more minute when they come down to the
[1:00:21] end.
[1:00:23] But it's not guaranteed. Everybody has a
[1:00:26] time and a season that God only knows.
[1:00:29] And sometimes God sometimes start to
[1:00:32] prepare you when your season come. But
[1:00:35] but sometimes it come all of a sudden
[1:00:36] and you don't have time to fix the
[1:00:38] things that you think that you should
[1:00:40] fix. But if God has placed it on your
[1:00:43] heart to fix it, fix it now.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; There there there's no reason to let it
[1:00:47] linger on till tomorrow when you can fix
[1:00:49] it now. Not only if you fix it now, the
[1:00:52] stress and all the relief that that'll
[1:00:54] bring to you, you're not accounting for
[1:00:56] that cuz you just think it's got to be
[1:00:58] this grand ceremonial thing, but if it
[1:01:00] if it's something small, sometimes
[1:01:02] that's all God wants you to do. So you
[1:01:04] can stop blocking your blessing.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; So that you you can stop blocking what
[1:01:09] God has for you and and not be afraid.
[1:01:11] You know what, God? If you're removing
[1:01:13] this, you got something greater for me.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; If you taking me out of this, you got
[1:01:18] something better for me.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; It said and and I I was telling one of
[1:01:24] my friends, I said, "Sometimes I feel
[1:01:26] like right now is the season of change.
[1:01:29] It's the season of change. And when the
[1:01:32] se when when changes start coming
[1:01:34] sometimes you don't like the changes
[1:01:37] when the it's just like the weather
[1:01:38] right now. You might not like how it was
[1:01:40] this morning if you walked outside. You
[1:01:42] might have walked out with a short
[1:01:44] sleeve and said I might need a jacket
[1:01:45] today. And you might not like wearing
[1:01:47] jackets, but but you see you might not
[1:01:50] like the seasons when they change. But
[1:01:52] there's a reason that the seasons have
[1:01:54] to change. There's a reason that things
[1:01:56] have to have to cycle and revolve and
[1:01:59] that we have a winter. We have a cold
[1:02:01] time and we have a hot time and we have
[1:02:03] a time where things bloom and we have a
[1:02:05] time where things die.
[1:02:08] Because without these seasons, the world
[1:02:10] wouldn't work as they would. We wouldn't
[1:02:13] have crops. We wouldn't have food to
[1:02:15] eat. The the sun and the moon, if the
[1:02:17] moon wasn't there, then the tides
[1:02:19] wouldn't move. And when you realize how
[1:02:22] intricate God allowed this universe to
[1:02:25] be, it can only prove that even if he
[1:02:29] cares that much about the universe, how
[1:02:31] about you and me?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; If he cares about the sparrows, how
[1:02:35] about you and me?
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; The ones that can go to God and talk to
[1:02:39] God and God can talk to us. So if he
[1:02:42] cares about the little bird sitting on
[1:02:44] the tree,
[1:02:46] what about you and me?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, I don't have to be afraid to
[1:02:50] go to God anymore because God loves me
[1:02:53] more than I may love him.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; He loves me so abundantly that he he let
[1:03:00] Jesus come down and die for me.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; He thought about me before the
[1:03:04] foundation of the world and thought
[1:03:06] about all my m all my mistakes, all my
[1:03:09] trials, my tribulations, all my failures
[1:03:11] and said, "You know what? I'm still
[1:03:13] going to choose him.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; I'm still going to allow him to be
[1:03:16] saved. I'm still going to allow him to
[1:03:18] hear the word in this last day. You know
[1:03:20] what? I'm going to put him in this last
[1:03:22] day.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Because God knew from the beginning of
[1:03:26] time if he put you here, he would give
[1:03:28] you the ability and the equipment to use
[1:03:31] that you could overcome in this day and
[1:03:32] age.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; So, it's not an excuse to say, "Well,
[1:03:36] this is just how it is." That's not
[1:03:37] that's not a good excuse
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; because God done been delivering for for
[1:03:42] 6,000 years or so.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if God ain't changed, if he's
[1:03:46] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[1:03:48] you can't use that as an excuse.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Well, we got the internet and so it's so
[1:03:52] much more available. No, there was
[1:03:54] trials and tribulations then, too.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; But you got to have the ability and say,
[1:03:58] "Lord, I want to overcome the enemy
[1:04:00] that's in front of me.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to overcome the enemies
[1:04:03] that's in my life. Lord, I want you to
[1:04:06] do the work that I can be a testimony of
[1:04:08] what God can do." Amen. Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Because I'm no longer afraid that God is
[1:04:13] going to keep me.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer afraid that if I make this
[1:04:17] decision, it's the it's the right
[1:04:19] decision or not.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Because I know the God that that's been
[1:04:24] keeping those that are in front of me. I
[1:04:26] know that's the same God because I've
[1:04:28] seen him work in my life.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; I know that's the same God cuz I I've
[1:04:33] heard him speak to me. And if you
[1:04:35] haven't had those experiences, then you
[1:04:37] need to get down to where you can have
[1:04:39] those experiences with God. Cuz I
[1:04:41] believe that if you go to God in
[1:04:43] sincerity, he will answer your prayers.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; If you go to God and and sometimes you
[1:04:48] might not even be in in in the perfect
[1:04:51] condition on the outside.
[1:04:54] You might be in your lowest moment, but
[1:04:55] when if you go to God in sincerity, I
[1:04:58] believe that he'll answer your prayers.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] that I I believe that and you can't be
[1:05:04] afraid to go to God just because of
[1:05:06] where you are and what you going
[1:05:08] through. See, God is going to give you
[1:05:10] the victory if you re if that's what you
[1:05:13] want.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I'm reminded of the story and
[1:05:16] I close with this. I'm reminded of the
[1:05:18] story with brother Brandham. There was a
[1:05:20] man that came into the meeting and he
[1:05:23] had a reputation for being a very strong
[1:05:25] man, but he was demonp possessed. And
[1:05:28] the demons would tell him to go up there
[1:05:30] and beat up the preacher.
[1:05:32] And when when when he would do these
[1:05:34] things, he came into brother Brando's
[1:05:36] meeting one day and he came up to the
[1:05:39] pool pit and he was going and the spirit
[1:05:41] of God allowed brother Brandon to speak
[1:05:43] to him and brother Brando spoke to it
[1:05:45] and the spirit left him and somebody
[1:05:48] asked him is he delivered.
[1:05:50] He said no. He said because he loves
[1:05:53] that spirit.
[1:05:55] So many of times you have to be careful
[1:05:57] that you don't get attached to those
[1:06:00] things that are in your life
[1:06:03] because they may be holding you back
[1:06:05] from getting your true deliverance.
[1:06:07] You have to be careful that you aren't
[1:06:09] holding on to things that God want you
[1:06:11] to let go for your for your blessings
[1:06:14] and for your healing because you're
[1:06:16] holding on to something. Don't let that
[1:06:18] be your story or your testimony because
[1:06:21] God may be trying to take you to a
[1:06:23] higher place and a higher level. And the
[1:06:25] only way for you to get there is to let
[1:06:27] things go.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; The only way for you to get there is to
[1:06:30] go to God and say, "Lord, I'm not afraid
[1:06:32] no more of what's going to happen or how
[1:06:34] it's going to turn out or what it's
[1:06:35] going to be. Lord, I know that you've
[1:06:37] given me the victory.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; I know that you worked this out in such
[1:06:41] a way that Lord, that I can be honest
[1:06:43] and I can be truthful with you that
[1:06:45] Lord, I've given it all to you." Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; And that's it. That settles it. I I'm
[1:06:49] not worried no more because God, I know
[1:06:52] that you doing the thing that you said

[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the word tonight.
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; There's so many good things that was
[1:16:29] said tonight. Amen. Lord,
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I was thinking uh as brother Simmons
[1:16:34] here at the end was talking about the
[1:16:35] world insane
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; and the only sane place is in Christ.
[1:16:39] Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about the other day I
[1:16:41] picked Moses up from school and and we
[1:16:44] saw something. I told Moses I said I
[1:16:47] said man in the '9s they would have been
[1:16:50] put in a mental institution
[1:16:53] if they came out the house like that. I
[1:16:55] said the people would have know they was
[1:16:57] out of their mind. And I was talking to
[1:17:00] some boys at work and I was sharing with
[1:17:02] them something and they told me they
[1:17:04] don't even go to church the boys. They
[1:17:06] said, "Ernest, you know the whole world
[1:17:08] has gone crazy." They said, "But the
[1:17:11] crazy is acceptable now." And I said,
[1:17:14] "That's something, ain't it?"
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That we know that it was going to be the
[1:17:17] whole world gone insane.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And it's acceptable, but it's still not
[1:17:23] acceptable to God because he said, "I'm
[1:17:25] the Lord and I change not." Right? So I
[1:17:28] says when we see where the world is
[1:17:31] going, we can be thankful that God has
[1:17:34] kept our minds. That we still got a mind
[1:17:37] to want to do right. Still got a mind on
[1:17:40] Friday night to want to come out to the
[1:17:42] house of God. No matter how tired you
[1:17:44] are, no matter what you got going on,
[1:17:46] you still want to worship God. Amen. So
[1:17:48] I thought that I said, "The Lord knows."
[1:17:51] I says the the more the darker the age
[1:17:54] get. It might not be but a few of us but
[1:17:56] the brighter the light go shine. Amen. I
[1:17:59] mean appreciate that tonight. Amen. It
[1:18:02] was so many good things that was said
[1:18:03] tonight. And I thank the Lord. Amen. Uh
[1:18:05] the word is coming but it's you got to
[1:18:07] receive it. Amen. As Mary took it and
[1:18:10] pondered on it in her heart. You got to
[1:18:12] do the same thing cuz the word will work
[1:18:14] for you. Amen. It's no nothing small
[1:18:17] with God. When God releases the word
[1:18:19] it's great. Remember that his word has
[1:18:22] got an ability like brother Caleb was
[1:18:24] saying things changing you know it might
[1:18:27] not be but one grain of sand at a time
[1:18:29] but that mountain is moving you know and
[1:18:31] the longer as as he said you live in
[1:18:34] this life you learn to let go and just
[1:18:36] let God have his way with a lot of
[1:18:38] things Lord I'm giving it all to you
[1:18:41] right because you keep carrying those
[1:18:42] things you won't be able to sleep at
[1:18:44] night up word blood pressure up all
[1:18:46] those things but you you learn with some
[1:18:48] things and say Lord I'm just giving to
[1:18:50] you,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Lord. I'm going to let you have it
[1:18:52] because I know that you're able and you
[1:18:56] will take care of it. How many believe
[1:18:57] that tonight? Amen. God is so good.
[1:19:00] Amen. Let us bow our heads again. Amen.
[1:19:03] Lord, we just thank you tonight for the
[1:19:05] word that we heard, Lord. And oh, our
[1:19:08] brother pouring his heart out, Lord.
[1:19:10] There was so many golden nuggets that
[1:19:11] were given out.
[1:19:13] Oh God, I believe that if we can take
[1:19:15] it,
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; oh God, and live by it, oh that it'll be
[1:19:19] a blessing to our hearts. It'll bless
[1:19:21] our homes. It'll bless our lives. It'll
[1:19:24] bless those that are around us. And
[1:19:26] that's what we love. We love the
[1:19:28] blessings of God because we know that
[1:19:30] when you bless us, it don't add no
[1:19:32] sorrow to it. Oh God, we thank you for
[1:19:35] that tonight. Continue to bless our
[1:19:37] brother Caleb. Lord, bless, oh God,
[1:19:39] those that here, Lord. Oh God, bless
[1:19:41] brother Anderson knows Lord as they're
[1:19:43] traveling the highways and oh God I just
[1:19:45] pray that you'd bless your children all
[1:19:48] over the land Lord as we depart this
[1:19:50] place but never your presence. We thank
[1:19:52] you and Lord we love you in Jesus
[1:19:54] Christ's name we pray. Let the church
[1:19:57] say amen.
