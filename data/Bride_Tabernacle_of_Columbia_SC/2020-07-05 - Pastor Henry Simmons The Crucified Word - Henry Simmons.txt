him what a mighty God we serve this morning as we look at the book of acts the second chapter the 22nd verse God is good praise God x2 and 22 want to talk to you today about the crucified world for Christ has been identified throughout all ages but we want to talk about the crucified word the word has always been despised and rejected of men I heard Peter said two stones that were set at nought of you builders same has become the head of the corner he's been a rejected King and a rejected stone but as we talk to you today about the crucified word somebody's saying the song can't you see how they're done my lord I trust that you'll be able to identify and to recognize how they have done wallow the crucified word Christ identified throughout all ages acts 2 and 22 you men of Israel hear these words Jesus imagine a man approved of God man approved of God among you all among you by miracles wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you that ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determined counts and foreknowledge of God you taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain that god bless the reader which word you may be seated you've crucified and slain surely can't you see how see what they have done to my lord they crucified and the set of slain says in 24 verse whom God raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it they for David speak concerning him I foresaw the Lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved there forth in my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou will not leave my soul in hell he went to hell for you and I but he wasn't left inhale I would not leave my soul in Hell neither with our supper the Holy One to see corruption he died but he did not see corruption his body did not see corruption it did not modify because he was the word said thou has made known to me the way of life thou shalt make me full of joy will tock countenance men and brethren let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David that he's both dead and as supper Co is with us unto this day therefore being the prophet and knowing that God has sworn withhold to him that of the food of his lawns according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to set on his Rome seeing this before speak of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in hell we didn't leave him there neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus has God raised up world we are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shared for this which he now see in here for they saw on the day of Pentecost the outpouring of the Holy Ghost they were to tarry in Jerusalem after Jesus had rose from the dead and gave them they meant a commission I want you to tarry in the city of Jerusalem I want you to wait there tell you be endued with power from on high brother and sister amen you need to wait they meant till you get the power amen he said after the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall have power and you should be witnesses of me when the power will come maybe you can't witness till you get the power but when the power will come you can catch somebody hallelujah that the comforter has come you can catch somebody ibid Reedy by the blood of the Lamb oh yes it's time that we take a stand for the word the crucified word now he says for David has not ascended into heaven the 34th Ward sense but he say it's himself the Lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand until i make tower fools die footstool therefore he meant therefore let all the house of israel north surely all columbian north surely everybody here and everybody listen north surely I want you to a man I want you to be able to hear and recognize what Jesus and who Jesus is and what he's done for you and I that all the house of hildren or surely let all the house of Columbia nor surely the God in me that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ the same loan that he killed the same one that died God raised him up I'm saying you cannot kill the word they can try but God has the power to called away to live again for truly Jesus Christ they meant what the Word made flesh and now him being the word I heard him when he was gone from judgement Hall to judgment home what is truth the truth is the truth [Music] so brother and sister the devil did not attack even Adam but he attacted the world he said god I want a question I want you to reason with me fold in a while but rather sister you cannot compromise and reason with the word when God said something it's perfect they made it converts to Sarah you cannot try what the word God we believe it and we receive it and accept it but what happens the devil tries to put a little doubt in your mind David ye has God see that I have a tree Oh God you can eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil but God does know that if you eat of that you'll become like god oh yes he tries to make you eat the tree of doubt and unbelief and he can you to intellectually reason with the word has to be accepted the word just like it is fake leads would not take the place of the way God has fortified and covered men when they were fortified by the Word of God and he had clothed them with his word the word was good enough to keep dama called in in righteousness are you with me but what the devil did he caused him to doubt what God said and that's the day and that's the day amen what God came in the cool of the evening she found what he took their agent covered themselves he said I hid myself because I was naked Wow they were naked because they will adopt the covering of the world brothers sisters let the word cover you they put on the whole armour God hey if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you can have what you will I will do it I'm saying God waited better close unite with his word the crucified the world then afire through all ages they meant the word they met before it was a word it was a thought and the thoughts we speak of at the genes of God what was in God's mind he wanted to express amen and God a man began to speak a many Stokes Amen when God spoke his talks they meant they became the way and I faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God I want you to know Amen we got a powerful thing they meant when they got dog food we got a powerful weapon know that they met the Word of God it'll keep you they met in a hill he said it wide and it healed them the ignorance of the word give it night David the word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against God the word is a capable the word is a healer the word is a deliverer the word is you see the way will transform you the word would change the word would deliver you the way would such a free Wow yes the word the Crucified word the devil has always talked to were three the Lord the devil we've been killed Department because the Word of God came to the prophets and when the word came to the prophets amen the devil wanted to get rid of the way so the devil they meant we'll get to the mind of the people and called the people not to believe the Prophet even if I can get them to reject a prophet then I can get them to reject the words because the word was in the prophets they meant but the Bible say he meant the word was in Moses and the people amen they came against Moses when they got to the Red Sea they said Moses why you brought us out here to die you should have left us in Egypt why because the word was in Moses Moses was the word God the children he wasn't to kill Moses Amen I want you to know he meant when he made the word come it's a persecuted word they made the word are called you to suffer persecution you have to go do something because the word as always the word tears sometimes you have to cry amen because the people don't understand the word got to be tried and tested yes he meant the word in the days of Noah it was a rejected word and the world no because he had the word and him because the word was in him they crucified the word they told the word I don't believe you [Music] when you walk away shoulder the people had gone out the bail showed up came down he meant a larger one day after amen he had done a great thing and turning the children hearts back to the way the judge by Bill the clad that she was going to get larger for what he had done and she was after the way she was going to get larger and larger just killed all the prophets that devil-worshipping Bale and when Jezebel got the Bible said he ran on he'd himself and he said I'm by myself Amen Lord when you little don't all got the law told you to do [Music] [Music] when you take by yourself that's consolation knowing in the time of trouble he's a present help I said put your trust in God stand for the word and Stanley is in your darkest hour because you kept the word of my patience I also will keep you in our tribulation with jubilation karma I'm gonna keep you because you kept my word when you hold the god word God don't keep you don't worry about a thing you got a God gonna fight your battle I'm so glad that I got a god that takes care of business hallelujah God it cares oh yes mother sister the word has always been the spot rejected crucified word Romans 6 I want you to know something here in Romans 6 it says and 5 he said Romans 6 and 5 it says for if we have been planted together and the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man are you with me that I all man is crucified with him they meant he started off that chapter said what should we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound God for the Amen I want you to know that God died for your sin amen and when you repeat it and was buried in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of yourself amen have you been product in the likeness of his death brothers sister the Bible said we can rise up back to water walking in newness of life Amen I want you to know you can put on with your me in the Fellowship of his suffering I'm talking I'm talking for me and I want to suffer with you when you go through these light affliction it's but it's only gonna last a little don't don't give up hold on and hold you might be going to adversity now but don't they meant when your troubles come just know won't be always a man in might in duel for night but I want you to know the joy it's gonna come in the morning it's gonna work - you're good just hold - God one changing hand Lord I hold I'm gonna walk the walk because I'm talking the talk because you live amen he said in the six verse six and six knowing this that our old man is crucified I want you to look at what Paul said that I all man is crucified and I want to ask you a question is he crucified are you they never live in a crucified Life hey man I want you to identify with his crucifixion amen you must live a crucified life I know folks want to live like the world they want to act like the world they want to dress like the world they made praise God but I tell you then you've got to be crucified they meant if you're not crucified amen if you're not with me you against me Amen you can't serve God and the world they made If any man love the Father amen if you love God and if you love the world the love of the Father in not India they meant if you love God Amen you forsake the world amen you'll give up something to give up the boyfriend on the side give up the girlfriend you'll give up they meant all done clean things they may because you live in a crucified life they might praise God I'm talking about the word exclusive on our old man exclusive on the thing that we used to do we don't do all normal places we used to go we don't go no more I'm talking about Crucifier life the old man is crucified that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin I've gotta come to a close today deletion 5 in 24 as we close the day amen crucifixion has the old man been crucified have you die to your flesh die to yourself are you have you decided to take up your cross and follow Jesus amen don't be ashamed say that to know him take up your cross and follow him 5 and 24 says here and David our Christ are you with me they that are Christ's have what crucified the flesh have you been crucified I said have you been crucified I don't know what it means they crucify the flesh oh that is in the world the lusts of the flesh and the pride of life these things are not of the Father but of the world we're gonna pass away in the left there are I want you to know something you got to kill that old man that old nature that all said for nature how do you kill them let Jesus take care of that devil they meant by coming and accepted what he done for you on the cross the crucified way he went to the cross that your sin might be forgiven the love of God let it come down in your heart and if you love God you depart from evil if you love God you keep its commanding if you love God you'll want to live right they'll be long gone you'll want to talk right he said and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affection and the lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit the crucified way the word today if the Bible is right in the Dark Age is wind they wanted to pull the wool over the people eyes and the water declined the folk they took the Bible's awake and they put it in a language which the people could not understand until the Reformation Korea came and they started the printed Bibles in the people language they killed the word but the word began to rise again I want to say they have done despite to the word of truth the same Jesus same words they're doing not today they meant they're saying things and doing things that they called just and right they're standing there making laws amen that will take and make the Word of God look like it's against the law ah but God got a people that would not bow down they meant to the the things that the swirls God got a people that's gonna take a stand for the way they stand up because they have been obtained and they have been chosen to stand for God way you him God has called you God knew you need not know that they made you need him that you might think that you need a lot of things in this world one day the world is gonna be on fire but I know that God gonna please a shelter to hide you one day man the Bible said that made him both Lord and Christ he's my king and he's my high priest he's not and he's not Savior are you whooping he's the same Jesus you've taken with wicked hands you crucified his slave but God had raised him up meaning both Lord and Christ will you'll know him they said we don't want him crucify him somebody's saying we don't need the Bible it's too holy it ain't fair it ain't yes but we're serving a god that's a just God he's gave us his way and his word is our law but they are saying he meant is not talk it's not the model thing they make the word is dated a man is old-fashioned you can't use it for the modern day world it's too old it's been that bad not for us today but I want you to know the same Jesus the Bible said the same Jesus same yesterday and today don't let them fool you don't let the devil lie to you you don't need the Word of God you don't need the word he meant with this well catch a fire when you stand before God one day you gonna be gone and will you be ready oh yeah God you see you don't have to be lost you don't have to go to hell he's trying to spare you and save you from a lot of sorrow but you got to come to Jesus accept the word the word of the Spy's it's rejected it's a Bleen word it's a bloody word because taking the wicked hands crucified is sweeter they killed the very truth they met and they laugh at it they laugh at your Bible they despise your way they call it all kind of names that for the white man is that's it for that amen but I want you to know the Word of God if it's time to test no matter what they say about the word I know the word is right they may be called the word no longer just
