in that door right amen praise God Heaven is Waiting on you but you got to come through the door okay so we'll get there in a minute let me finish reading first resurrection blessed is Holy is he that has part in the first resurrection for in the second death y'all know the second death is a lake of fire as it said in the last verse amen I mean in the 14 verse the the and death and hell was sto in the Lake of Fire which is the second death in the 14th verse it says death and hell was cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death amen when you have part in the first resurrection you don't have to worry about going in the Lake of Fire isn't that right somebody tell you no such thing as the Lake of Fire but the Bible said is you're going to wait and believe what they say and end up there or you going to believe the Bible but blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection for in the second what death there's no power isn't that right praise God you can either die now or you can die later because there going to be a second death every knee should bow every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father that's going to be another death you can die now and then you got to die again or you can die amen in Christ and you'll live again are you with me are y'all with me so I I I don't mind dying now and if I die now I don't have to die no more praise God hallelujah okay I'm back at the sixth verse again blessed and holy he that has part in the first resurrection uh on the such as second death has no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ God call you priest amen and shall reign with him for how long years when you like you know people live a 100 years and they thought they've done something you'll live and reign with him a thousand years and that's not the end of amen that's it's not all over then you still got an eternity to to be with God Amen are you with me but the rest of going to be throw in the Lake of Fire those that not accepted Jesus Christ as their lord and savior those that don't want Amen to take advantage of what God is offering them now amen praise God and he says and when the thousand years were expired Satan shall be what loosed out of his prison the devil know he going to prison are you with me the Bible says souls in prison now amen we we the Bible says in the days of Noah the people were saved by water the water saved them and the water destroyed those that didn't believe in the day days and all is't that right the same word saves you would condemn the world the same Jesus amen the Savior one day he'll come back as judge and they'll be condemned because they didn't accept the Savior those that incept no message amen that it's going to rain amen they rejected the message those that received the message amen they was able to be saved and not drun but he said in second first Peter that amen the people that when God offered them salvation the wait longsuffering of God waited in the door days of Noah he said the like figure whereing to eight Souls were saved by water the like f were to baptism does also now save us amen he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be what damn are you with me that's what the Bible said now are you with me so the Bible said You Must Believe and as you believe shall be baptized you shall be baptized amen not only in the water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen are you with me so you need to be baptized in the water because you believe because you've accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and savior of your life and then you go down in the water for the remission of your sin in the name of the one that died for you the Lord Lord Jesus Christ you rise up out the water Amen to walk in newness of Life are you with me now if you go down in the water just because your friends went down because Mama went down amen it's nothing took place in the inside you're going down uh uh dry and coming up wet because nothing took place in this in the inside but if you have really accepted repented of your sin ask Jesus Christ to be your lord and savior you become your personal savior when you go down in Jesus name your sins are remitted and you shall walk in newness of Life am are you with me amen now if you go down in the tie of Father are not baptized in the name of the father son Holy Ghost you baptized wrong you forget all about everything h Huh I did all of that and did it wrong yeah because he told you to be baptized in the name and all you did was repeat it you know somebody say I said go get me a glass of water and they repeat go get me a GL glass of water now if you understand what I'm saying you go bring me some water I ain't got none either see what I'm saying just to repeat me don't mean you done what I said but if you understood what I said then Peter on the day of Pentecost said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ because he was talking to the 11 amen and when he told him what to do they did it on the day of Pentecost we talking about the keys Amen to the door Jesus actually as disciples one day when he in in Matthew 16 and 13 Jesus coming to the course of sister the Philippi he asked his disciples whom the men say I the son of man am some said that you're John the Baptist some say you Elijah Jeremiah amen a one of the prophets but he said who do you you say that I am and Simon Peter answered thou the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed are thou Simon B for flesh and blood is not revealed

it just made me excited anyway why you so excited about God in Simplicity revealing himself in the same Jesus said in the verse one verily verily I say unto thee he that entered not in by the what let me read it again in case you hadn't caught up yet verily verily I say unto you he that enter not by the what door not by the door into the sheep for but clim it up some other what the same name is a what thief and the robber I'm going to show you who the thief and the robber is in a minute are you with me and you climb up any kind of other way you a what I said the key to the door are you with me the seventh verse I got to skip over some of these things you can read it later and it said then said Jesus unto them again are you with me truly truly a very very I say unto what I'm I'm talking about he talking to who is he talking to you do you believe he talking to you praise God are you listening you sure are you listening truly truly I say unto you I said God ain't telling you no lie he telling you the truth amen he said that I if you're wondering about the keys to the door I want you to know know who the door is Jesus said I am what you believe that Amen to the Sheep fo I was over in in in Romania some years ago and while I was over there in Romania I sometimes the Sheep are on the road and you know the traffic want to get by and and it's something about the shepherd He has a a staff in his hand and he's walking and you know the Sheep of behind him maybe 40 50 sheep behind him and that Shepherd is's walking with that staff in his hand and the car's coming you think that sheep going to run out somewhere those those sheep I didn't see one sheep say the car are coming I'm going run in front of the Shepherd getting out the way those those sheep stayed right there behind that ship shepher and none of them passed the shepherd and get out in front of him not one of those sheep they knew the shepherd there I said look at this look at it see they said in the night time back in the day the they they they put the sheep in a little uh Clos in thing and the shepherd He would lay down in front of the door the exit and the Sheep because the shepherd is laying there keeping the wild animals and all of that watching over the Sheep are you with me the shepherd the Good Shepherd David saw the bear coming saw the lion coming and David was a Shepherd boy that's why he said the Lord is my shepherd and I are you with me so David understood what he was talking about amen and he said we are his people and the what sheep of his Pastor amen he understood that we were like sheep but go the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want I know he'll take good care of me the Good Shepherd to lay down his life for a sheep isn't that right oh God I I'm getting on something else let let's let's just try to stay with this he said all that ever came before me was what he said if you come if you if you don't come by the door you amen are you with me in the first verse he said if you didn't come by the door the same as a what thief and a robber isn't that right people think they going to go to heaven anyhow I'm going to heaven anyhow I don't have to have the key amen I
