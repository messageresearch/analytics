him in a mighty way father we ask these blessings upon your people tonight in Jesus name we pray amen and amen turn with me to the book of First Peter second First Peter 1 excuse me one in 22. a little something we shared back at home there and Sunday School from a different angle tonight in Jesus name one First Peter 1 and 22 it says seeing you have purified your heart you purify your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfaged love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorrupt but by the word of God or to liveth and abideth forever father we ask you to bless the word tonight in Jesus name amen let me be seated also I want to turn also to the book of um Saint John 33 but I want to come back to First Peter Saint John Saint John 33 excuse Saint John 13. every one of the moments of you huh Saint John 13. and 34. a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if ye have love one to another amen I'm gonna go back to First Peter 1 and 22. I want to maybe for a few minutes tonight try to which you know you never can explain the love of God because it's Eternal it's much deeper than what we even can imagine with our little finite brain to really Express what the love of God really is all about I believe in scripture said for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but I want to speak a little bit on unfeigned love unfeigned love or the love of God I just title it when that word unfainted mean not hypocritical is genuine we like to say in our term let it be real sister to sing the song whatever you do for Jesus let it be real let our love be real as he said here one for another the love of God it constrains you to go an extra mile for someone not so much to say that as we like to call it in our ranks I like to use the terminology but the love of God goes outside of our box it even goes outside of our churches one place they say what good of you to love them that love you don't the public in the same but the love of God if he did for each and every one of us in spite of what and where we were and what we were doing God love went beyond that you know and I know myself we were in a horrible condition foreign they didn't even deserve the mercy and the grace of God that he had upon us but and he liked to say sometimes uh God go way down and pick us up I like about the love of God because uh as people look at it and how they label it you know you have the goody good people you know and the good of good people love other good and good people but that wasn't Jesus approach he went beyond and went to those that are without no hope per se amen amen the Castile the ridicued one that life that was so messed up they could not reconcile themselves back but God did I like that you know and you know I guess you know your life that we live and where we came from and we all can testify that we shouldn't be where we are tonight but it was God's grace and I wonder sometimes can we extend that Grace to somebody else that when God found you you weren't the good person find the rejected the one even sometime that our own family didn't want to have nothing to do with us you were like me you made a family name a shame because of how you turn out but it wasn't over there God began to move in our lives and God began to turn your life around one thing I learned if you put your trust in people you in bad shape and sometimes God let it get that low the way even you yourself give up hope but God didn't give up on you God knew the right time to the right place that he was going to begin to turn your life around someone said God let it get so messed up that you couldn't even fix it that's what I'll tell people a lot of time don't judge nothing before the time because God ain't through yet the worst one or the worst situation that may look bad now but remember God got the last say so here Paul a Peter was seen a scene that you have purified your heart your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit until unfeigned love of the brethren he says see that you love one another with a pure heart that's what God wants us to love with a pure heart not on conditions not having respectable or person because what they drive what they wear where they live it goes beyond those things it goes way deep this I guess the terminology that people love to use and it's all here you know when they uh look at things sometimes they tell oh brother that was deep let me tell you what's deep the love of God when it's pure in your heart hmm the love of God is not selfish in other words it's not about you it's about somebody else is that what Jesus did he laid his life down not for himself but he laid it down for us [Music] I think about that soon the sister don't say that that make me want to shout right there deep you want a deep mystery the pure love of God in your heart the circle of God said that's what the world is looking for the real love of God not because of your church affiliate you a deacon and you're a preacher or whatever you are no no no no beyond that God didn't categorize us in sections you know like the people trying to do today try to put you in sections no God law loves uh one of the purpose that that Avail was ripped he tore down the middle wall he told down every barrier [Music] up and he went beyond the camp they're using this in a Sunday School from a different angle though we took it from the book of First Corinthians 13 how Paul you know was saying that though I give my body to be burned you know and do I can uh move mountains I know all the Mysteries and have all knowledge he said but if I have charity don't have charity it profit me nothing they know all the Mysteries give your body to be burned pay all the money in the church and have not charged see the love of God the love there's healing evening love but it has to be real it can't be one-sided we see that a lot on one side of it but no that won't work God not looking for that kind of one-sidedness God wants you to love them that don't even love you you said by this they'll know you are my disciples when you get in love love like I love you come on somebody don't love like the Church of the preacher a discipline they know Love Like Jesus love his love go out sometime of your way and reach out to somebody who nobody else wanna fool with everybody else walked by and shake their head and you see that person you see how they look you see you forget how you were sometimes I believe you know a lot of times you know I just think especially I get a chance to go back home you know I circled the little block and all that I used to live and we asked to hang out at and all I can do when I grew up in I said Lord thank you amen I say because I could have been dead right here you know I should have been gone right here but God is saying when I think back over my life so I got a testimony what's your attachable God has been good to you somebody said even better than you then you've been to your own self we were self-destructed people people killing our own self but God brings in his Mercy said no oh my God I believe it's the love of God Is Right is the love of God is right in our hearts tonight when ought to be illegal but it's all is really you were here in our soul a demon to be cast love does that not gifts propaganda I'd Rather Have Love in the church with no gifts oh that ain't the message there isn't it you go beyond the quotations we're looking for realities not just saying that one said the Lord let their love of God be so real in us that people know you in their men and when God is there sister brother demons but it got to be there you can't fake it no either don't fake it till you make it you got to have it and God has to give it to you amen property he said uh when the son of the Holy Ghost is the love of God you say you received the Holy Ghost did the love of God ought to be so in your heart that where you you to the unsavable oh my God I I just I try to you really bet this back home you know I sit back home at the church there that you know regardless of how people come into the church doors and I would say I say don't you bother them they dress don't don't you bother that let God do the work let God do what he's supposed to do we just love him look up people coming like we thinking you know they're not just properly they don't know the things that you know sometimes we get a little you know uh I beat one place in the Bible it's saying for a man come in your church with a goal apparel you say I'm up front in the Amen Corner but that better come in here you go back to everybody he said no we must not do that we must understand it could be an angel unaware you can be entertaining an angel and they may be dressed like a bomb and just like and talking crazy but then God has a word for you your angel came dressed not like a saint God can disguise himself it already looking man that don't look like much but yet he was an angel how many of them met people so strangely who you never ever saw before when they pop up in YouTube and then they gone they said what was that people the earnest they had something like that to happen look for the man nowhere to be found where did he go step into the Angel that's visiting him he had a world he didn't look like much did it so did Jesus Bible said there was no Beauty inside he didn't look like much he didn't dress like the king and the partners and the rose and the gold and all he came looking ragged yet he was God In the Flesh to do what to reconcile the world back to God again through humility through his love and he demonstrated his love for the time let alone the words over he had Deeds see he loved or makes you do something it has worked if I can find this Matthew 5. you know I'm I'm learning you know I thought about something you know is at the little and I do appreciate you know uh Matthew 5. remember the years back you know in my family double a little puzzle you know as Brother Gibson and the Seven of those brother Isaiah those way back in the early in the 80s the late 80s 89 and and how they used to come uh from mullen's way to Manning to pick me up for church and they questioned me why are they coming so far why you have to go way down there and my answer was to them that right now you don't when they know what's going on and they wouldn't take not one dime from me they would not want me to do anything to give them a return anything of that nature you know and I'm a man like this you know I don't say much about certain things I just look and I watch you know but what really got me that I saw a difference and I grew up in a Christian home you know in church and you know the speaking in tongues and the shouting and the music and all of that you know but this was beyond that I saw something that was real and it wasn't what so much of what did was they said to me because it really didn't talk a whole lot about anything about how you're doing stuff like that but they didn't we didn't say anything about the message or anything like that but there was something a distinction that that there was a care a genuine a genuine list they go now that we know much better that in the Christian realm you really have some mean folks I mean me in the name of Jesus and the people feel that that ain't you know it ain't real and sometimes they'll just says that's what you call uh well you got I I don't I keep what I got because they see the parallel of you and them is the same [Music] so they are and the difference is not what we talk about amen but in what you have in here and it must be real it can't be fake I know we'll deal with that a lot in a lot of years but when the people wasn't fooled by but they can tell in real love when somebody care about me and not about what I can give at the church where they were telling um young couple another last week of the week the Lord blessed that we we baptize a husband and a wife there the name of the Lord Jesus Christ out of front just coming off the street really not knowing much about God and the Lord blessed they came to the service gave their life to God and we baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ on last Thursday but it's something you know about them you know that when they uh saw some things especially the sister immersed the question of a question and she wanted to know she said well what about them pants bro I said what about him she said is that okay I said well let's see what the Bible say about it and also had one of the little tracks there with me in the Bible on the dress code and we came to a house for the study then she said oh brother she said I see that thing so I got to get rid of these things I was not gonna tell her for sake but I just knew that her heart was right with God then God are you sure and when you get it that way that God revealed it to you and he show you and give you an understanding hey I shouldn't be doing this then you can't say your brother John box having on do it about 77 no no no no no God words say then when you become a witness you can see let me show you what the Bible said because too many times we do things because the preachers say it or this will say it but if you see it already in the word and in the Holy Ghost tell you you shouldn't do that it's a difference because I'm going to tell you something if a man can put you in it he can take you out but when God give it to you I said when God give it to you no devil out of hell see that's why the love of God see because you love God in your heart and you want to do that which is right you don't want to do anything you know to hurt him just please him in other words because your love is right like a man say your love is the wife and he's cheating on the he don't really love her your lover can scream you I don't want to do nothing to hurt my wife because your heart is pure your love is genuine you know you don't want to see no harm come to you no kind of way so you try to you know abstain from evil keep yourself separated from the things that's going to contaminate you all type of foolishes you name a religion that's one of the biggest Destroyer the people that's religion silver Garcia to send more people to Hell than the bootleg joint good religion is fake leaves I said Matthew didn't know Matthew 5. 44. yes Matthew 5 and 44 said but I say unto you love your buddies love your enemies oh my bless them that do what I had an incident and I hope I can say this in the right respectable way at uh we were teaching on the Statue of a perfect man you know you'll speak on certain things and told you the devil come and test you and I spoke on special perfect man some things and went to the store next door and a lady was there you know intoxicated heard another lady you know been looking kind of wild and really kind of rough you know and I was in the store just waiting and she looked at me and she said something terrible you know what not and I just told her I said ma'am I said God made me thus I didn't Flinch I didn't feel no kind of Airway brother and then she said it again I said ma'am God made me what I am I can't change that then also she said how you doing sir I say I'm doing fine how are you doing in a minute the column and little with her looking at me to get thought we're going to go off you know because she don't know me never saw me before I don't know her but the devil for that moment just annoyed her to say some derogatory stuff you know but God was so good I didn't even flinched it even moved you know and I forget what all we said but at the end of it you know she said sir and I said ma'am God bless you you know but but because then if I had the think about it a little while if I had to think what I'm gonna say if my women home The Man Behind the cabinet looking come on you know and leave it with her I've been looking kind of you know funny like oh goodness she gonna get knocked out you know when they look at her you know what not but you know thank God thank God for his grace and his Mercy he kept me and never had no bad feelings even father later because I realized that the devil don't know enough the devil will anoint people just to see how we're going to kind of react some people said don't try me because I just lay the whole it goes down for a little while and then I'll pick it back up when I get through you don't have it right yet then you don't have it right because there is coming a persecution there you will be tried I said Lord don't try me like you did David spit in his face saw a long Sun tried to kill him David still said don't touch him see don't touch the anointing don't do my protest no and I want to know you know this over here we are going to be tried on what we are confessing because it got to be more than just word confessed it got to be something you possess not just on Sunday on Friday you have to be seven days a week all day long in night can the love of God don't just leave if it's pure if it's real if it's not hypocritical it's there and you don't have to act it because it's something God gives you that's why the Holy Ghost is so important it's love it's a gift a gift of love that he hasn't stored upon you they keep you in the hour of your temptation how many of you believe that it'll keep you in the hour one more scripture Romans 12 and I'm closing there many more as I was thinking on these things and I got sat down and started writing I wound up I said God this is just I know this is too much you know so I'm not trying to um maybe I'll carry it back and do a part two or three back home they're marrying what not because I understand this don't you know all mistress and or you can give your body to be burned if you don't have any cherry you don't have the love because they talk about perfect love perfect love God is the only perfect person and God love is perfect and when you get him in you then it'll live out what he really is because he's loved and if you're giving out anything different it's the wrong spirit and it comes through the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you get love right [Music] oh my I wish that people can do you know one place it was saying they're great one of the greatest commandment if you to love God with all your heart all your mind all your soul oh what a love if a church full of love I believe the gifts and the power of God will be it explode you talking about having Church When Love is just playing solving Grace will take over love because demon to be cast out love a cover a multitude of sin love or do it love and heal love and deliver love is set free that's just saying this on Let It Be Real let it be real whatever you do for Jesus oh that's what we need in this hour what do we want from that we want our love for God to be so real now where people will want what you got it's not what you're saying it's not what you're reading and what you got on your walls in your office and no no that's all right you want to do it but that still don't mean nothing because see the delicate impersonator the gifts he can impersonate it Paul said they assist but he said what love never okay Romans 12 and I'm coming brother Caleb I said Romans 12 9 and 10. it says let love be without this humiliation abhor that which is evil Cleaves that which is good be kindly affected one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another not slopefully business forever in spirit servant Lord rejoicing hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to necessity of saints given to hospital bless them which persecute you bless and curse not you know I'll be with something it says it's uh the little foxes this board of mine it's not the big thing it's the little foxes see the love of God you know it words said but it's something that has to be anchored in you and you when the love of God is really a dear you will learn to humble yourself and you will care more about others it won't be about me where I got what I got I got this I do this I do this no how about that one that's without women don't even know Jesus as a person who said yes they may be on drugs they may be bound let me be this way but your love for God letting her sister brother I know somebody that can help you and you can give me your testimony because he helped me when I was in this participant when I was in this shape God came by one day when I even had no hope in myself God reached down and picked me up how about that kind of love how about a church that can love like that and when people come in the door they just repent they run to those that I want to be saved because there's such a love of God we don't want to come to church with envy and strife and all type of contention we should have come to church like that which the government started free and loving and if you got a spirit on the gifts of wings and alter your seat see God deliver me take that Spirit off of me God is fill me with your love how many you want that that kind of love that it goes down way always down to even your children know that you love them not because of what you buy them but there's something in you that's real you care and you're praying because talking we how many know we don't talk talk talk haven't changed anything yet let's talk to Jesus now man Let's Get Down let them oh I know the old the old folks had that model I'm gonna tell you something they cried out all night long it got worser but they didn't stop praying Lord Marshal Lord dear soul I don't know where they at oh God but you know where they at Lord drive them home some kind of way silver God said when you pray like that he said something gold is happening oh Lord come on don't think your prayers something is moving and it's not acting worse that's the good sign yes God is moving why because the love of God can screen you God bless you tonight [Applause] praise God I thought about something where Jeremiah just saying and brother brother called and left a message on the answer machine and I called him he said y'all ain't forgot about me I've been going through some trouble times right now and I said I said oh my numbers got off my phone because every now and then I call him check on him and sometimes you think you look around and you say so-and-so and ain't here I think it'd be good to you know just call and check on somebody that you ain't seen in a while because you don't know what they're going through and when you say well you know they don't want to come don't let me be the only one chicken if you see somebody that's not here check on them see how they're doing and gotta you know reward you and sometimes I have to back up a little while somebody said well you ain't checked on me I lost all my numbers so I got a big excuse now if you to call me and check on me then you realize I lost all my numbers I'm trying to get them all back but by the grace of God but by the grace of God y'all let's just continue to continue to pray one for another and you don't know what happens to we can get busy in life don't mean no harm we can get busy in life just busy so much can be happening and sometimes Folkers think that you forgot about them you can be praying for them God calling their names out they thank you for God one thing about it God will never forget you I keep telling everybody God gave me consolation he said I haven't lost one I won't lose any either because God haven't lost one all that the father given me there come I'm confident of that one thing that God would not lose not one of his children praise God all that he full knew amen God won't lose one God bless you let us stand appreciate the word tonight God friend love of the Brethren let us love one another praise God not with partiality but with genuine pure love of God can't get that Wing except God come down in US move out all love misunderstanding all the fear and all the doubt praise God property God spoke a word to the church he said [Music] 99 90 of this time or 99 of the time things happen and people think one against the other he said it's just a misunderstanding most all the time people separate themselves and they thank God this and that and said the devil be done shot some poison in there and make them think something that ain't there are you with me so by the grace of God let's get rid of all the poison all looked out and all the field just Lord I I want to love like you love me I was telling them mothers last night I want to love like God loved me I want to forgive like God forgave me amen he didn't say I'm gonna forgive you partially he forgave us completely in whole it didn't matter I will send and didn't matter our condition God didn't say well I I you know what I'm saying he just loved us amen and let's love one another like God loved us then we can get one to forgive one another see we can't forget one another until we have that kind of love praise God it takes that kind of love that agape love to be able to forgive like God forgave us are you with me God bless you let us smile father we thank you tonight
