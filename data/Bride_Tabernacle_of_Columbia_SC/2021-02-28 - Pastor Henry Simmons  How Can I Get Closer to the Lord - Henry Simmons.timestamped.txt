[59:32] the devil is just tempting you he don't
[59:34] want you to talk to god
[59:36] he don't want you to communicate with
[59:38] god that you ever know
[59:40] amen that if in that praise god
[59:44] hallelujah if you pray and read your
[59:46] bible you're going to be closer to the

[59:59] once you start loving it your 15 minutes
[1:00:01] turn into half an
[1:00:02] hour and your half an hour turn into an
[1:00:05] hour
[1:00:05] and then next thing you know you're a
[1:00:07] proud warrior and you're communicating
[1:00:09] with god
[1:00:10] you say heaven isn't this good
[1:00:14] how many of you ever walk out got up out
[1:00:15] of a prayer and say oh
[1:00:17] lord amen you felt so good you felt so
[1:00:21] oh lord amen and you you know you
[1:00:25] once you build that kind of relationship
[1:00:27] and you
[1:00:28] lose it then you miss you miss your
[1:00:31] communication you fall in love with god
[1:00:34] and you know amen you and god got uh
[1:00:38] a thing going on you and god got
[1:00:41] something going on you and god

[1:00:47] you love him so you want to communicate
[1:00:49] you want to talk to him
[1:00:51] amen that's what i like what brother
[1:00:53] fred said amen
[1:00:54] amen his testimony amen praise god
[1:00:58] so i i want you you got to have a
[1:01:00] communication with god
[1:01:02] you got to know that god talked to you
[1:01:05] god
[1:01:05] amen he communicates amen
[1:01:09] and you know if you know god is god amen
[1:01:12] he don't never change
[1:01:14] amen if he can talk to them in the bible
[1:01:17] he can talk to you because you're in the
[1:01:19] bible
[1:01:21] are you with me but sometimes we don't
[1:01:25] talk to god
[1:01:26] we talk to one another and we fail to
[1:01:29] talk to god
[1:01:31] amen i believe we ought to spend more
[1:01:33] time talking to god
[1:01:35] than talking to one another and we spend
[1:01:38] more time talking to god
[1:01:40] because sometimes people try to
[1:01:42] interpret
[1:01:43] what you meant when what you saying
[1:01:46] you know what i'm saying people spend so
[1:01:48] much time analyzing
[1:01:50] why did the why did they sing that song
[1:01:53] why did he preach that sermon why did he
[1:01:54] say that
[1:01:55] why uh i don't know why he said it i
[1:01:58] don't know why she
[1:01:59] you know the word is not to why
[1:02:03] amen if god is speaking to you you say
[1:02:05] thank the lord he wasn't saying nothing
[1:02:07] to you
[1:02:07] you just said pray for him amen because
[1:02:11] you're talking to somebody else what if
[1:02:13] he's talking to you
[1:02:14] you say amen lord thank you lord are you
[1:02:17] with me
[1:02:18] but you trying to analyze why you said
[1:02:20] that renee said
[1:02:21] you said to somebody else they got it i
[1:02:24] don't know how many times i walked off
[1:02:26] the pulpit
[1:02:27] and i said something and i said why did
[1:02:29] i say that i didn't mean to say that
[1:02:31] and then when i walk out the pool a bit
[1:02:33] somebody said well you know lord spoke
[1:02:35] directly to me
[1:02:37] i said thank you lord and i you know and
[1:02:40] it happened all the time when i'm on the
[1:02:42] road
[1:02:42] preaching out evangelizing and stuff and
[1:02:45] i
[1:02:45] i i and all of a sudden i leave my the
[1:02:48] message
[1:02:49] and i started dealing with stuff and
[1:02:51] then i said oh lord
[1:02:53] and then when i walk off the pastor said
[1:02:55] how do you know all of this stuff
[1:02:58] i said i need to know nothing amen but
[1:03:01] the holy ghost knows what we need
[1:03:03] amen so by the grace of god god
[1:03:06] sometimes he
[1:03:08] when we come to church amen don't try to
[1:03:11] analyze what the preacher is saying
[1:03:14] amen but when you get a critical spirit
[1:03:16] to you everything
[1:03:18] everything is to be criticized and
[1:03:20] analyzed and
[1:03:21] amen and then that's what preaching is
[1:03:24] all about that is not what the pastor
[1:03:26] and what the ministry of fivefold
[1:03:28] ministry is about they're here to preach
[1:03:30] the word
[1:03:31] and when they're preaching the word amen
[1:03:34] then the holy ghost is saying
[1:03:36] things to the people it's got not have
[1:03:38] nothing to do with you this time
[1:03:40] but you wait a little while he gets to
[1:03:42] you
[1:03:44] are you with me because we all need
[1:03:47] amen the word of god are you with me
[1:03:51] so it's the word that gives us life
[1:03:55] and if we're not the word of god we will
[1:03:58] not live
[1:04:00] but if we want to live it takes a word
[1:04:03] so i i said ephesians 6 he says
[1:04:10] uh
[1:04:14] in 12
[1:04:18] i don't know what i read about
[1:04:23] it says for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:04:26] and blood
[1:04:29] but against principalities against
[1:04:31] powers
[1:04:32] against the rulers of darkness of this
[1:04:34] world
[1:04:36] amen so
[1:04:40] that's if you realize what you working
[1:04:43] against
[1:04:44] what you're wrestling against then
[1:04:46] you'll pray
[1:04:50] i try to get the young people to
[1:04:53] understand
[1:04:54] you know a lot of times
[1:04:58] you think you're wrestling against
[1:05:01] what somebody said about you what
[1:05:02] somebody did to you you're not wrestling
[1:05:04] against that
[1:05:07] it's spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:05:12] you'll know that a lot of times
[1:05:15] before a war start the wall takes place
[1:05:18] in the spirit
[1:05:19] realm and those demons begin to possess
[1:05:22] people to do certain things
[1:05:26] are you with me and the devil he would
[1:05:29] get in people to inspire them
[1:05:32] to go to war at one another
[1:05:35] are you with me and he does that to
[1:05:38] nations and the principalities and
[1:05:40] powers
[1:05:41] and the kings and the kingdoms amen
[1:05:45] so the devil would come into your house
[1:05:46] and come into your home
[1:05:48] and he would have anoint spirits to
[1:05:52] divide and cause
[1:05:53] havoc he comes into the church and he
[1:05:56] anoints
[1:05:57] spirits to amen to keep the people
[1:06:00] divided
[1:06:01] a kingdom divided against itself cannot
[1:06:03] work
[1:06:04] stan a house divided against itself
[1:06:06] cannot work
[1:06:08] stand isn't that right but how do you
[1:06:11] pull together
[1:06:12] in spite of what's going on
[1:06:15] amen read your bible and what pray
[1:06:19] and if you pray amen you'll find out
[1:06:22] that god can
[1:06:23] speak through your prayer and he can
[1:06:25] identify situations that you didn't know
[1:06:28] nothing of
[1:06:30] amen the thing that most of
[1:06:33] us got to discover we got to discover
[1:06:36] our weaknesses
[1:06:39] and when we discover how weak we are
[1:06:41] then we'll realize
[1:06:43] amen that i as an individual need help
[1:06:46] from god
[1:06:48] you know i got so many things going on
[1:06:50] with me

[1:08:09] word for

[1:08:21] purchased with your own blood
[1:08:23] i'm gonna tell you something i'm gonna

[1:08:27] it oh i i i don't want to get off into
[1:08:31] something
[1:08:32] let me go on and read uh what i wanted
[1:08:35] to read
[1:08:36] the 13th verse
[1:08:45] no let's just let's just go on 18th
[1:08:48] verse
[1:08:49] praying always with all prayer and
[1:08:52] supplication in the spirit
[1:08:53] watching there into with all
[1:08:55] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:08:58] saints
[1:09:00] and for me that utterance may be given
[1:09:03] unto me that i may open my mouth boldly
[1:09:07] to make known the mysteries of the
[1:09:09] gospel
[1:09:10] see paul realized that he needed he
[1:09:13] needed
[1:09:13] prayer he needed you to pray for him
[1:09:16] amen if paul needed you to pray for him
[1:09:19] i need you to pray
[1:09:20] for me are you with me
[1:09:23] that utterance may be given that i can
[1:09:26] open my mouth boldly
[1:09:29] are you with me and that's what is
[1:09:31] needed you
[1:09:33] it's not enough for me to identify or
[1:09:36] see somebody's weakness
[1:09:39] it's enough for me when i see that i can
[1:09:41] get on my knees and start crying out for
