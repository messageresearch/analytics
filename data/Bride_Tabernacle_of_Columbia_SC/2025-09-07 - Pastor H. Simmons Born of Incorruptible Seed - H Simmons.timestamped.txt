[32:29] deliver in Jesus Christ's wonderful
[32:32] name. Amen.
[32:34] [Music]
[32:36] The book of first Peter 1 and8.
[32:40] 1 Peter 1:18.
[32:45] God is good. Amen. Amen.
[32:50] For as much as you know
[32:53] that you were not redeemed with
[32:55] corruptible things as soul
[32:58] from your vain conversation received by
[33:00] the tradition from your fathers,
[33:05] but with the precious blood of Christ
[33:09] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[33:12] spot,
[33:14] who
[33:16] verily was forained before the
[33:18] foundation of the world,
[33:21] but was manifested in these last times
[33:24] for you.
[33:26] Who by him do believe in God that raises
[33:31] him
[33:33] up from the dead, and gave him glory,
[33:37] that your faith and hope might be in
[33:39] God.
[33:41] Seeing ye have purified your soul in
[33:43] obeying the truth through the spirit
[33:46] unto unfriend love of the brethren. See
[33:50] that ye love one another with a pure
[33:53] heart fervently,
[33:55] being born again, not of corruptible
[33:58] seed, but incorruptible, but by the word
[34:00] of God, which liveth and abideth
[34:02] forever.
[34:03] For all flesh is as grass, and all the
[34:07] glory of man is as the flowers of the
[34:10] grass. The grass whether the flowers
[34:13] thereof fall away. But the word of the
[34:16] Lord endures forever. And this is the
[34:21] word which why the gospel is preached
[34:25] unto you. May God bless you. You may be
[34:28] seated.
[34:33] I was thinking
[34:37] on some things concerning
[34:42] being in the mind of God.
[34:45] But the subject this morning is born of
[34:49] incorruptible seed.
[34:52] Born of incorruptible seed.
[35:00] in being in the mind of God.
[35:05] We know that
[35:09] and I was saying what's what's God IQ?
[35:18] &gt;&gt; What is God IQ?
[35:21] Because sometimes people think that they
[35:23] are more intelligent
[35:26] and they uh they were they are smarter
[35:29] than God.
[35:31] So I asked the question
[35:33] uh what is God's IQ?
[35:37] Uh and sometimes
[35:40] in being in the mind of God I want to
[35:42] know we got to find ourselves
[35:46] in the word
[35:49] and just who are you? The Bible says
[35:53] that God's ways are not our ways and God
[35:56] thoughts are not our thoughts. as far as
[35:58] the heavens are away from the earth.
[36:01] So if God is
[36:04] so broad, he said, "How can I by search
[36:07] and find out God?"
[36:10] You know, it it's very very difficult
[36:14] to understand.
[36:17] For he said, "Eyes have not seen, ear,
[36:20] have not heard, neither have entered in
[36:23] the hearts of man the things that God
[36:25] has prepared for them to love him."
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; But he says that we have the mind of
[36:31] Christ.
[36:34] So I'm talking about being born again
[36:37] here in Peter, not of corruptible seed,
[36:39] but incorruptible.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Born of corrupt incorruptible seed.
[36:49] Born of incorruptible seed.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; What does that really in entail? Born of
[36:57] incorruptible seed. Amen.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says in second says
[37:04] is uh and um the book of acts 2 chapter
[37:09] that his soul was not left in hell
[37:12] neither did his flesh seek corruption.
[37:16] Amen. When lad was in the grave for 4
[37:19] days and so forth they said by and he
[37:22] said I go and I'm going to wake him up.
[37:25] And then uh his sister said, "Lord, by

[1:05:05] Do you want your promises?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Everything God promised Abraham, do you
[1:05:10] want it?
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; You want those blessings?
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now to Abraham and his
[1:05:16] seed." I'm talking about born of
[1:05:19] incorrupted seed.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to know what Abraham's seed
[1:05:24] is. And I want you to know what the
[1:05:25] incorruptible seed is.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible says his flesh did not see
[1:05:30] corruption, neither was his soul left in
[1:05:33] hell.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Talking about Jesus.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; But here it is. Not to Abraham and his
[1:05:40] seed were the promises made. He said,
[1:05:42] "Not unto seeds as of many, but as a
[1:05:46] one, that is
[1:05:48] to
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; to thy seed which is
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Christ."
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Christ Christ in you is the hope of
[1:05:55] glory.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Then he went on in the 26th verse. Let's
[1:06:01] 25 26 26 26th verse it says, "For ye are
[1:06:08] what?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; All the children of God." shake
[1:06:10] somebody's hand and ask you, "Are you a
[1:06:12] child of God?"
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "For you are all the children
[1:06:18] of God."
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; You're all the children of God.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Huh? Is that right?
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; I believe he's talking to the church.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; He's telling them who they are.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Can you identify with what he's saying?
[1:06:40] If you can't, if you can't, then you
[1:06:43] need to identify
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; with what he's saying.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:06:49] these that identify with it,
[1:06:52] they know that they are children of God.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Others said, "I don't understand.
[1:06:58] For ye are all the children of God by
[1:07:00] what?"
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Faith in Christ Jesus.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; That God so love you? Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; That he gave his only begotten son.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; That whosoever believe in him should not
[1:07:14] perish but have what?
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Everlasting life.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Do you have it?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; If you don't have it, do you want it?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people say, "Well, I don't I
[1:07:25] ain't ready for it now." Oh, Lord have
[1:07:27] mercy.
[1:07:29] You mean to tell me you ain't ready for
[1:07:31] eternal life?
[1:07:35] I ain't quite ready. I want it, but I
[1:07:37] ain't ready for it. So I get it next
[1:07:41] week and maybe a year from now.
[1:07:47] He said the day you hear his voice, what
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; if you hear him today and God speaks to
[1:07:52] you, you can't worry about if God didn't
[1:07:55] speak to the one next to you,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; God spoke to me.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; The day you hear his voice, heart not
[1:08:01] your heart.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; You come. Amen. For the day is the day
[1:08:05] of what? salvation.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; God is calling you to salvation. If you
[1:08:09] can see the word and the other can't see
[1:08:12] it.
[1:08:14] Well, I I I can't help that,
[1:08:17] man. I just thank God for opening my
[1:08:19] eyes.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Because I was blind one day, but now
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was lost.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God found me.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. He said, "You're children of God
[1:08:32] by faith in Christ Jesus.
[1:08:35] For as many of you that have been what?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Baptized in Christ.

[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; into Christ?
[1:08:46] You need to be baptized according to
[1:08:48] Acts 2:38. You need to repent and be
[1:08:51] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:08:53] the remission of your sins. You say,
[1:08:54] "I've been baptized in the name of the
[1:08:56] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." Tell me
[1:08:57] which one of those. The son is a name,
[1:09:00] father is a name, or holy ghost is a
[1:09:02] name. You said I've been baptized in the
[1:09:04] name the name of the father. Jesus said
[1:09:07] I come in my father's name
[1:09:09] and you don't receive me. If another
[1:09:11] come in his own name him and you will
[1:09:13] receive. But Jesus said he had his
[1:09:16] father's name.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; And what the father okay if you if you
[1:09:20] don't understand the name of the father
[1:09:21] son and go he talking about one name

[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ye therefore teach all nation
[1:09:31] baptize them in the name of the father,
[1:09:33] son and holy ghost. Right? In the name
[1:09:35] singular, right? Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Now, if you've been baptized in father,
[1:09:38] son, holy ghost, you've been baptized
[1:09:39] wrong.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; You want to get it right?

[1:10:11] word. The word was with God and the word
[1:10:13] was God and the word was made flesh.

[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He was in the world. The word was made
[1:10:16] by him. The word didn't know him.

[1:10:35] comforter." Isn't that right?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm with you, but now I
[1:10:39] shall." He said, "But I'm going to be in
[1:10:41] you."
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; And on the day of Pentecost, he said, "I
[1:10:45] want you to tear. I want you to wait
[1:10:46] until you be endured with power from my
[1:10:48] eye."
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; God above us, God with us, and God in
[1:10:51] us. That's Jesus Christ.

[1:25:37] Lord, he is a healer.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; He's a deliverer. I thank the Lord for
[1:25:41] leading me here this morning. I didn't
[1:25:43] know where I was going. And I know it's
[1:25:44] several churches around here, but I'm
[1:25:47] like Doc Holiday just about in every
[1:25:49] city I go to.
[1:25:52] I won't tell you why, but one day you
[1:25:53] may find out sin is rapid in this world.
[1:25:57] People are evil. I hear you preaching
[1:26:00] about religion. Religion is destroying
[1:26:02] people.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible said that he hates every false
[1:26:06] way. Had a preacher told me it's your
[1:26:09] wig, it's this, is you that. It's
[1:26:11] religion.
[1:26:13] If if religion if wearing a wig is a
[1:26:16] false way, then people need to take out
[1:26:18] their teeth.
[1:26:20] Hello. Some of them got false eyes. Some
[1:26:24] of them got false legs. They got false
[1:26:26] other stuff. But I thank God for the
[1:26:28] word. The word is right. The Bible said
[1:26:31] there's holiness. Holiness there's a
[1:26:34] highway and that way shall be called the
[1:26:36] way, not ways. A way of holiness. I
[1:26:38] thank the Lord for you. Thank the Lord
[1:26:39] for leading me here. I had a mind to go
[1:26:41] somewhere else. The Lord said, "No, you
[1:26:43] turn and go where you was last week."
[1:26:45] So, I thank God for the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:47] Y'all pray for me and I know God is with
[1:26:50] me. If no one else with you, God is with
[1:26:53] you. God said, "I never," he said, "I
[1:26:57] never do it. I never leave you nor I
[1:27:01] will forsake you." David said, "I once
[1:27:03] was young, now I'm more." He said, "I
[1:27:05] never seen the righteous forsaken, nor
[1:27:08] his seed."
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Begging bread. God bless you, uh,
[1:27:12] preacher. It's good to be here. Thank
[1:27:13] you for your your love and your
[1:27:15] kindness. And I want to tell you this
[1:27:17] before I give you the mic. I'm back here
[1:27:19] because of your hospitality.
[1:27:22] Yeah. Preachers are supposed to be of
[1:27:24] good hospitality, not self-willed. I
[1:27:26] believe that's the Bible.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. And so, I thank the Lord for that
[1:27:30] cuz when I came here, I felt welcome.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, everybody. I felt welcome
[1:27:35] here. I felt love. Bible say if we don't
[1:27:38] have love, we don't have God. So, thank
[1:27:40] you y'all. Keep praying for me in the
[1:27:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank
[1:27:44] you.
[1:27:48] Praise God. Thank God for you. Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; You have any questions, we glad to get
[1:27:55] with you after service. Uh this this way
[1:27:59] is you got to continue on. He said,
[1:28:02] "After saving the people out of the land
[1:28:04] of Egypt, you have to destroy them
[1:28:05] because the Jews said because of what?"
[1:28:08] Unbelief,
[1:28:10] you got to keep on believing. You can't
[1:28:12] just say, "Well, I'm saved."
[1:28:14] And then you don't you stop after saving
[1:28:18] them because they didn't continue on
[1:28:20] going.
[1:28:22] Amen. God destroying them. Are you with
[1:28:25] me? So, you got to keep moving. You got
[1:28:28] to keep on believing. Keep going
[1:28:29] forward. Amen. Till you get everything
[1:28:32] that God has for you. God bless you. Let
[1:28:34] us stand.
[1:28:39] They came out of Egypt. They never made
[1:28:40] it to the promised land.
[1:28:43] Your promised land is the baptism of the
[1:28:45] Holy Ghost. If you don't have it, you
[1:28:47] need to get it. Praise God. Just being
[1:28:50] baptized, you need the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] Let us just bow again. Father, thank
[1:28:59] you.
[1:29:01] Thank you for Jesus.
[1:29:03] Thank you for the spirit of the living
[1:29:05] God.
[1:29:07] Thank you for oh God, our young brother
[1:29:09] D'Angelo and Shanda. Lord, thank you for
[1:29:13] Ella McCrae. Lord, thank you for moving
[1:29:16] here this morning. Thank you for all the
[1:29:18] visitors this morning. Pray God that
[1:29:21] you'll move in each and every life.
[1:29:24] We'll see the supernatural God. God take
[1:29:27] a hold of our lives. See the power and
[1:29:31] manifestation of the spirit.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. God
[1:29:36] supernatural respond.
[1:29:39] God, please
[1:29:42] be with every family, every home, and
[1:29:44] every individual.
[1:29:46] Give traveling mercies to each and
[1:29:48] everyone.
[1:29:50] Lord, why are we absent one from the
[1:29:51] other?
[1:29:54] God, may you be with each and everyone.
[1:29:56] In Jesus Christ's name, let us all say
[1:29:58] amen.
