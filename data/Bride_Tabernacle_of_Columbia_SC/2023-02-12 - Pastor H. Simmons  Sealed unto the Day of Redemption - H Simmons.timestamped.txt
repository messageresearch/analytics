[44:43] roaring 26.
[44:55] and then shall they see the son of man
[44:58] cometh in the cloud with power and great
[45:01] Glory
[45:02] 28.
[45:11] and he spoke to them in the power of
[45:14] behold the Fig Tree and all the trees
[45:17] 30.
[45:27] so likewise ye when you see these things
[45:30] come to pass know ye that the kingdom of

[46:01] for either snare shall it come on all
[46:05] them that dwell on the face of the whole
[46:08] Earth
[46:09] together what she therefore and pray
[46:13] always that ye may recounted worded to
[46:17] escape all these things that should come
[46:19] to pass and to stand before the son of
[46:22] man God bless you and George you may be
[46:25] seated
[46:26] amen
[46:27] then we want to go to Ephesians here 4
[46:30] and 30. Ephesians 4 and 30.
[46:35] it says
[46:37] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[46:40] whereby ye is sealed
[46:44] until the day of redemption
[46:48] and we were
[46:50] in between two thoughts
[46:53] your Redemption draweth nigh
[46:56] and seal until the day of redemption
[47:01] seal unto the day of redemption
[47:04] now
[47:06] I've been preaching a little about this
[47:09] the book of redemption
[47:12] the seven seal book the book was sealed
[47:15] with Seven Seals in Revelation 5.
[47:19] and that was the breach between the
[47:20] church agents and the seals
[47:24] the book of redemption amen sealed unto
[47:27] the day of redemption
[47:29] and we asked the question what does
[47:31] redemption means
[47:33] and we talked about
[47:37] the title deed the abstract title deed
[47:40] and what abstract meant it means that
[47:44] it's been such all the way back to its
[47:46] beginning
[47:50] and Redemption we were redeemed
[47:53] because we were dealing with the blood
[47:55] of Jesus and what it means to each and
[47:57] every one of us
[48:01] and it was because of the blood of Jesus
[48:03] Christ that will redeem
[48:06] because we've been we've been redeemed
[48:08] by the blood of the Lamb
[48:11] are you with me
[48:12] so Redemption came through the blood
[48:15] amen
[48:19] and then we talked about
[48:21] the abstract kind of deed what it really
[48:25] Redemption really means that we have
[48:27] legal possession
[48:30] of all that was lost by Adam and Eve
[48:35] and as I was on my knees praying this
[48:37] morning and I said Lord
[48:39] in a legal possession for all
[48:44] that Adam and Eve lost we have it back
[48:47] we've been redeemed
[48:50] amen
[48:52] and because we have the abstract titled
[48:55] deed that went back in the hand of the
[48:57] original owner
[48:59] in the book of redemption now it's back
[49:01] in our hands
[49:03] are you with me
[49:06] so you have legal rights to all that
[49:08] Adam laws
[49:10] and I know if you had those legal rights
[49:13] it'll puff your head way up
[49:17] because if you don't know how to use it
[49:19] you abuse it
[49:22] are you with me
[49:24] see somebody gives you
[49:27] I was looking at you know most of the
[49:29] Millionaires and billionaires that you
[49:32] know it's hard to be humble so I thought
[49:34] about
[49:36] uh Philippians 2 and 5 Philippians 2 and
[49:41] 5. and that's why we have to deal with
[49:44] humility once we have uh achieved
[49:47] certain goals it takes a certain amount
[49:50] of humility not to be lifted up in Pride
[49:56] are you with me
[49:57] we can achieve very little things in our
[50:00] lives yet it's far beyond many of our
[50:04] equal
[50:06] and when you are able to achieve certain
[50:09] goals maybe you you you know you were in
[50:12] the ghetto or in the hood and you become
[50:16] a professor a doctor lawyer some uh
[50:19] maybe some distinguished person in life
[50:23] can you become that and still keep your
[50:26] humility
[50:29] and now not many people can deal with
[50:31] how to be humble once they have a
[50:34] reached certain goals and certain things
[50:37] in life particularly because uh they
[50:41] have an identity you know it was hard
[50:43] for Nebuchadnezzar when he had battle
[50:46] and look at what all this happened and
[50:48] God had to bring him down
[50:51] to his hair growled up his fingernails
[50:53] like the you know Eagles and you know it
[50:56] was he lost his mind
[51:00] begin to eat grass
[51:02] you know because God when God gives you
[51:05] something it's difficult uh uh to not be
[51:10] lifted up and and I and I said Lord the
[51:14] messages in which we've been preaching
[51:15] lately if you really receive them it
[51:18] could cause a certain amount of
[51:20] arrogancy
[51:21] and it can lift you off and you can walk
[51:24] with certain amount of pride if you
[51:26] really uh digested and you really uh
[51:29] it's really been revealed to you who you
[51:32] are and you've been redeemed I mean
[51:34] everything Adam lost it I have it now
[51:37] you mean to tell me everything has been
[51:39] restored back to me because I've been
[51:41] redeemed because of the blood of the
[51:43] Lamb
[51:46] see if you really knew who you were then
[51:49] you know what you possess
[51:53] but oftentimes we don't realize who we
[51:57] are to the full extent
[51:59] only we have pop uh uh partial
[52:03] revelation
[52:04] but we don't have the full revelation of
[52:07] who we are and what it means to be a son
[52:10] or daughter of God
[52:12] and because we don't we cannot express
[52:16] what we do not Envision and we do not
[52:19] understand
[52:21] so we don't understand the full impact
[52:24] of what it means to be a son or daughter
[52:27] of God then we'll never be able to use
[52:31] it
[52:33] but we might end up abusing it
[52:36] that's why he says in Ephesians 4 he
[52:39] said greed not the Holy Spirit or by you
[52:43] what
[52:44] sealed unto
[52:47] the day of redemption
[52:49] are you with me
[52:51] so God Amen it said after the Holy Ghost
[52:54] come upon you you shall have
[52:58] isn't that right
[52:59] so the power that we have when we reach
[53:03] certain goals it gives us certain uh uh
[53:06] uh Authority and power you know you can
[53:09] you know you can go into certain places
[53:11] you can do certain things and you can
[53:14] walk in in into a car dealership and
[53:17] says well I I like to have this Mercedes
[53:21] or this Lexus because uh you know
[53:23] because you know how powerful your money
[53:26] is
[53:28] you can walk in a neighborhood and you
[53:30] can say well this house might cost uh 10
[53:34] million it doesn't mean much to you when
[53:36] you you know you're a billionaire you
[53:39] know I I I I'll pay cash and I you know
[53:42] for it are you with me
[53:44] so when you realize the magnitude of Who
[53:47] You Are
[53:49] and I would suck my revelation of five
[53:52] and ten and he made us Kings and Priests
[53:55] and we shall what reign
[53:58] on Earth isn't that right
[54:00] so he's made us Kings and Priests and we
[54:03] shall reign on the Earth
[54:05] and as being Kings and Priests amen
[54:09] realizing amen who you are as a king and
[54:12] as a priest
[54:14] or you will be
[54:16] but amen who wants you know a lot of
[54:20] times folk want to be a doctor want to
[54:23] be a lawyer want to be a president want
[54:25] to be a congressman but who wants to be
[54:28] a
[54:29] you have the opportunity Amen to be a
[54:34] son or daughter of God which makes you
[54:36] above all of that
[54:39] amen so all the worldly achievements
[54:43] don't mean nothing compared to amen what
[54:47] God can make you
[54:49] not through amen the universities and
[54:53] the colleges in Yale lahava Cambridge or
[54:57] Oxford amen but I do amen praise God the
[55:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost and through
[55:04] receiving Jesus Christ as a Lord amen
[55:08] then God brings you into a place Amen to
[55:12] seal you until the day of redemption
[55:15] and your ceiling is the earnest of your
[55:18] inheritance
[55:20] it tells you that this is just a down
[55:22] payment on what God has in store for you
[55:27] amen oh praise God it's much more amen
[55:31] because you're in this circular body
[55:35] amen praise God you cannot fully
[55:38] understand the magnitude of the glory
[55:42] that shall be revealed in US
[55:46] are you with me
[55:48] so it's a glory amen that amen that God
[55:52] cannot fully express to you because your
[55:56] mind cannot comprehend it amen and your
[55:59] bodies cannot contain it
[56:02] are you with me
[56:04] so and that's why he said until the day
[56:07] of redemption amen
[56:10] okay I don't want to go too fast but
[56:14] you'll seal
[56:16] he says here in Philippians that's why I
[56:19] I thought about it I said that's why
[56:22] Jesus he knew who he was
[56:25] in in Ephesians uh two I mean
[56:30] Philippians 2
[56:31] and 5 it says
[56:33] let this mind be in you which is also in
[56:36] Christ Jesus
[56:39] are you with me
[56:41] that's why as a Christian he's telling
[56:43] you how to conduct yourself with all
[56:46] this Authority and all this power that
[56:49] I've given you I want you
[56:51] but let this mind be in you
[56:55] see it's something to humble yourself he
[56:59] says here who've been in the form of God
[57:02] thought it not what
[57:04] Robbie to be equal with God
[57:07] you see what I'm saying
[57:10] I want you to know who you are
[57:14] being in the form of God thought it not
[57:17] robbery to be equal with God
[57:21] because Jesus was
[57:24] it was God but because of this he says
[57:29] but being made
[57:31] excuse me daughter not but being made
[57:35] but made of him of no reputation took
[57:39] upon him the what
[57:40] the form of a servant was made in the
[57:43] likeness of what
[57:45] send men
[57:47] and being found in the fashion of a what
[57:50] a man he what
[57:54] see he said I got power to call 12 leads
[57:57] and Angels but he what
[57:59] I mean they couldn't kill him he said no
[58:02] man take my life huh
[58:04] and I got power what
[58:07] pick it up again
[58:09] that's why many times the prophet you
[58:11] know he told some of the Believers where
[58:15] to find some oil
[58:16] he said it's a big Golf Show and it's
[58:19] the main gosh is over there I think it's
[58:21] in Oklahoma somewhere he told him to go
[58:23] there and get it
[58:25] and they held back because he saw it in
[58:27] the vision he said why he didn't go get
[58:29] it himself all of that all he could have
[58:32] been a multi multi-billionaire
[58:35] you know what I'm saying but he saw in
[58:37] the vision he told him where it was and
[58:39] they didn't go get it
[58:41] you see what I'm saying
[58:42] and sometimes amen
[58:45] but he wasn't going to use God's gift to
[58:48] get rich
[58:51] are you with me
[58:52] some people use the ministry and the
[58:55] gift that God gave them to be rich
[58:58] God give you the gift of singing you're
[59:00] going to sing for money
[59:02] God give you the gift of speaking of
[59:05] preaching amen and you're going to
[59:07] preach for money
[59:10] are you with me God give you the gift of
[59:13] playing music you want to play for money
[59:16] you see what I'm saying but the prophet
[59:19] of God didn't use his gift
[59:21] to get rich
[59:25] and many people that all they have in
[59:27] their mind is riches
[59:30] as I told y'all on Friday night
[59:33] you know I've sat down with
[59:36] a brother that was a billionaire and
[59:38] people that was
[59:40] you know I had plenty of opportunities
[59:43] but at the same time
[59:45] you know what did that mean to me
[59:48] you got to know what God wants you to
[59:51] have
[59:53] see Jesus knew God's plan for his life
[59:58] he knew what amen he came to do in the
[1:00:02] preference was for him being born
[1:00:06] and because you don't understand your
[1:00:09] purpose then you might fall for any lie
[1:00:13] of the devil the devil can tell you amen
[1:00:16] won't you be this won't you be that
[1:00:18] you're going to be this and that and it
[1:00:20] wasn't it pleases God or not you don't
[1:00:23] even understand the plan of God for your
[1:00:26] life
[1:00:28] but many people because they don't
[1:00:30] understand the plans of God some of us
[1:00:32] live beneath the plan of God some of us
[1:00:36] try to live above the plan of God but we
[1:00:39] must understand God's perfect will for
[1:00:42] our lives
[1:00:43] Jesus himself said Lord not my will but
[1:00:48] your will be done and once we found out
[1:00:51] that God's purpose and God's Will and
[1:00:54] God's plan for our lives amen we will
[1:00:57] begin to a life will be much more
[1:01:00] simpler
[1:01:02] but life is very perplexed
[1:01:05] in very troubling when we don't really
[1:01:09] know God's purpose and plan for our
[1:01:12] lives
[1:01:13] and that's why and we try to achieve
[1:01:16] certain goals because this is amen this
[1:01:20] is what life is all about
[1:01:22] brother and sister uh I I I find Within
[1:01:27] Myself amen that I I I I I I I I I I I I
[1:01:30] I'm still amen not saying that I've
[1:01:34] already comprehended already apprehend
[1:01:37] but this one thing I do know
[1:01:40] as Paul said forgetting those things
[1:01:42] which are behind me
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:47] and and I pressed towards the mark of
[1:01:50] the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:01:52] that's in Christ
[1:01:55] are you with me
[1:01:56] I Got Heaven on my mind
[1:02:00] but let me let me just tell you uh here
[1:02:03] and he says he humble themselves and
[1:02:06] they first uh uh uh humble himself and
[1:02:10] became obedient to death even the death
[1:02:12] of the cross
[1:02:13] now who would think that that was God's
[1:02:16] plan
[1:02:18] for his son his only begotten son that
[1:02:22] God had a plan and that plan was for him
[1:02:25] to die
[1:02:28] are you with me
[1:02:30] and you know the uh the man that walked
[1:02:35] on water the man that told Lottery to
[1:02:37] come back from the dead after stinking
[1:02:39] for four days the man that in that
[1:02:43] praise God talked Spirit to the wind and
[1:02:46] the Sea and said peace be still but yet
[1:02:51] yet it looks like he's defeated
[1:02:54] yet God plan for his life was death
[1:02:59] but not for himself but for you and I
[1:03:03] not for anything with all the power and
[1:03:05] authority
[1:03:07] that he thought it not rivalry to be
[1:03:09] equal with God
[1:03:11] but made of himself with no reputation
[1:03:14] are you up there
[1:03:16] but you and I we want something men
[1:03:19] reputation that we want to be looked up
[1:03:22] to want to be somebody in society
[1:03:26] we want our heads and shoulders to walk
[1:03:29] that we've achieved and accomplished
[1:03:31] certain goals
[1:03:33] I said the greatest achievement of any
[1:03:35] one of us is to be a son or daughter of
[1:03:38] God
[1:03:39] praise God I said the billionaire wish
[1:03:42] that he could
[1:03:44] the millionaire cat I'm on it but I
[1:03:47] can't hide it
[1:03:48] amen but you and I have what the world
[1:03:51] cannot give us
[1:03:53] amen we have eternal life
[1:03:56] and it could not be project with blood
[1:03:59] you cannot achieve it with education
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:04] you have to come to Humble way
[1:04:07] you have to come to the cross
[1:04:10] oh God and bowel your knees into the
[1:04:13] Lord Jesus Christ and Lord I need you
[1:04:17] praise God I need you because I know you
[1:04:20] have amen thoughts concerning me
[1:04:24] amen you have a plan for me
[1:04:27] praise God and I want your plan and I
[1:04:30] want your will to be done in my life
[1:04:35] praise God Amen
[1:04:37] when we can humble ourselves before the
[1:04:40] master and recognize that the master has
[1:04:43] a plan
[1:04:44] praise God hallelujah
[1:04:47] wait leaves may I follow
[1:04:50] God has
[1:04:52] he says humming himself to the death of
[1:04:54] the Cross wherefore God also has what
[1:04:58] Holly exhorted him
[1:05:01] if you want to be exalted
[1:05:03] amen God will highly exalt you
[1:05:08] I'm I'm just coming into visions of
[1:05:11] certain things you know sometimes we're
[1:05:13] afraid to walk
[1:05:15] we're afraid to
[1:05:17] receive what God gives us
[1:05:20] because we said I don't want it
[1:05:23] and some of us trying to get what God
[1:05:25] don't want us to have
[1:05:28] so we all are all baffled with some folk
[1:05:31] and we're struggling and we're having a
[1:05:35] hard time mind battles sickness in the
[1:05:37] body all kind of stuff happened to us
[1:05:39] because well we don't know what what
[1:05:42] we're kind of lost when amen
[1:05:45] we're in this world we will be trying to
[1:05:48] adjust to it and we don't know how to
[1:05:50] make adjustments
[1:05:54] I'm not talking about you I'm talking
[1:05:55] about myself also
[1:05:58] and not Lord the Lord is simplifying
[1:06:01] everything
[1:06:02] is coming so simple now
[1:06:05] and in this Simplicity of of God now God
[1:06:10] wants to simplify life for you
[1:06:13] he wants to take the pressure off of
[1:06:15] life
[1:06:16] because amen sometimes you know
[1:06:19] sometimes as a Christian we just don't
[1:06:20] know
[1:06:21] but the seals have been taken off the
[1:06:23] book
[1:06:25] are you
[1:06:29] let me I know
[1:06:33] I I got I got some scriptures to go
[1:06:36] through and I I I'm trying to make it
[1:06:39] short because I guess I've been
[1:06:41] preaching for 20-30 minutes lately but
[1:06:44] let me just look at Romans 8.
[1:06:48] he humbled himself
[1:06:50] it's something to walk humble
[1:06:53] I'm talking about Redemption
[1:06:56] you're sealed into the day of redemption
[1:07:00] praise God
[1:07:01] Romans 8. here talks about
[1:07:07] 8 and 14.
[1:07:09] it says
[1:07:14] as many
[1:07:16] as of what
[1:07:17] led by the spirit of God there I was
[1:07:21] I want to preach but I can't if I do it
[1:07:24] then I'm gonna mess up
[1:07:30] I'll mess it up I want you but I want
[1:07:34] you to see it
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:37] see without the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:07:39] going to be led by the spirit of God
[1:07:44] but
[1:07:46] as many as a led by the spirit of God
[1:07:49] they are the one
[1:07:51] sons of God now God has made you and I
[1:07:55] amen Kings and Priests
[1:07:58] and you must be led by the spirit of God
[1:08:00] to be a son of God
[1:08:03] see the spirit of this world Amen
[1:08:07] it's going to try to please the flesh
[1:08:11] but the spirit of God is going to please
[1:08:13] God
[1:08:16] are you with me
[1:08:19] and a lot of times we please our flesh
[1:08:21] because we amen are not led by the
[1:08:24] spirit of God and because we're not led
[1:08:27] by the spirit of God we're getting a lot
[1:08:28] of trouble a lot of headaches a lot of
[1:08:30] pain a lot of stuff we go through is
[1:08:32] because we're led by our own spirit
[1:08:36] the trouble that we get in a lot of
[1:08:39] sickness and afflictions come on our
[1:08:41] bodies and in mental battles and all
[1:08:44] kind of things because we're not subject
[1:08:47] the Bible said he thought it not Robert
[1:08:49] you'll be given God but he made of
[1:08:51] himself and no repetition and harm on
[1:08:53] himself
[1:08:57] the servant and found in the fashion of
[1:08:59] a man he humbled himself
[1:09:02] it's hard to
[1:09:04] see if we can get a people to walk in
[1:09:06] humility we can get a people that's
[1:09:08] going to be blessed people
[1:09:10] but we cannot we can man it's uh it's
[1:09:14] hard to be humble amen and to know amen
[1:09:17] that oh Hallelujah
[1:09:20] without god with nothing
[1:09:23] amen somebody said we like a ship
[1:09:25] without a sail
[1:09:27] without him I can do nothing
[1:09:31] okay
[1:09:32] so let me
[1:09:34] he says
[1:09:39] the 15th verse ye have not received the
[1:09:43] spirit of what
[1:09:45] and that's what I was talking about the
[1:09:46] the Redemption means that you're no more
[1:09:49] bound to sin until the things of this
[1:09:52] world
[1:09:53] because everything in this world will
[1:09:55] bring you into bondage
[1:09:58] amen so you don't want to be abound all
[1:10:01] this in the world is what lust of the
[1:10:05] flesh
[1:10:06] lust of the eyes and the what
[1:10:09] proud of this life we're not bound by
[1:10:11] these things let us not uh subject
[1:10:14] ourselves he made us Kings rulers we uh
[1:10:18] and you should Reign on Earth
[1:10:20] praise God you above that I'm not saying
[1:10:23] that we should not get our degrees in
[1:10:25] college I'm not saying that you amen God
[1:10:28] gives you the ability to give to achieve
[1:10:30] great things in life thank God for that
[1:10:33] but that's not you you know that's
[1:10:35] nothing
[1:10:36] because what God has given is far beyond
[1:10:39] all of this stuff
[1:10:40] so I'm not gonna let this stuff bring me
[1:10:43] into bondage
[1:10:45] but we realize that amen that's all the
[1:10:48] world have and that's why they're in
[1:10:50] bondage to it because that's all they
[1:10:53] got
[1:10:55] are you with me
[1:10:56] but God has given us far beyond that
[1:11:01] okay he says you receive the spirit of
[1:11:04] bondage
[1:11:06] again to fear
[1:11:08] so what I'm what I'm saying we don't
[1:11:11] fear I might lose my job uh uh I might
[1:11:15] lose my money
[1:11:17] you know what I'm saying
[1:11:18] I you know I lose your job lose your
[1:11:22] money you know what I'm saying fear of
[1:11:25] these things losing it
[1:11:28] amen we we we are afraid to lose our
