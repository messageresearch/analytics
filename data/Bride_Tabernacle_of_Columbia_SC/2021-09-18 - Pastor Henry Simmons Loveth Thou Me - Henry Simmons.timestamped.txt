[28:05] jesus has already fixed it amen
[28:09] god bless you
[28:12] saint john 21 15.
[28:17] and it reads
[28:18] so when they had dying
[28:22] jesus said unto simon peter
[28:27] he said unto simon say to peter
[28:31] simon peter simon
[28:33] son of jonah
[28:35] loveth
[28:36] thou me more than these
[28:38] and he said
[28:40] unto him yea lord
[28:42] thy noise that i love thee
[28:45] he said unto him
[28:47] feed my lamb
[28:49] i'll let you to read the 16th church
[29:07] he said unto him the third time simon
[29:11] son of jonah loveth thou me
[29:14] peter was grieved because
[29:18] he had said
[29:19] unto him the third time loveth thou me
[29:24] and he said unto him lord
[29:27] thou
[29:28] knoweth all things
[29:31] thou
[29:33] knoweth that i love thee
[29:35] jesus said unto him
[29:38] feed my sheep 18.
[29:58] thus speak he signified by what death he
[30:02] should glorify god
[30:04] and
[30:05] when he had spoken this he said unto him
[30:09] follow me
[30:10] god bless you reading this word you may
[30:12] be seated
[30:17] i was just meditating upon the word and
[30:21] as i was meditating upon the word is
[30:24] these scriptures began to go through
[30:28] through my mind and i just
[30:30] looked like the lord just given me
[30:34] a message and it's from different angles
[30:37] and i like to just to share with you
[30:40] some of the angles in which
[30:42] you know i i thought about you know the
[30:45] capstone and the headstone come into the
[30:47] body
[30:48] but he says love without me
[30:52] more than these
[30:56] love without me more than these
[31:00] so we think that
[31:02] jesus knows all things but he said
[31:06] love is thou me
[31:10] and then
[31:13] jesus did not call him
[31:15] peter but he called him simon
[31:20] what came in my spirit was
[31:25] jesus
[31:26] didn't ask him one time do you love me
[31:30] but it was three times that he had to
[31:34] say
[31:34] do you love me
[31:36] just what if jesus
[31:38] questioned
[31:40] you
[31:42] concerning
[31:43] your love towards him
[31:47] and you might reply to jesus
[31:50] lord you know i love you
[31:53] but
[31:54] peter action
[31:59] a few this is after jesus had rose from
[32:02] the dead and they was going back if you
[32:04] read the uh uh
[32:06] the upper part of this chapter
[32:08] they jesus was resurrected and
[32:11] yet appeared to them and
[32:14] and they were out fishing and they
[32:16] hadn't caught nothing
[32:18] and
[32:19] jesus
[32:21] uh
[32:22] said
[32:23] i want you to cast your net on the right
[32:25] side of the ship
[32:28] and you know sometimes when jesus tells
[32:30] you to do something you just do it
[32:33] and uh so
[32:35] when they did because
[32:38] though they had tall all night and
[32:40] everything they were knowing how to fish
[32:43] but all of a sudden
[32:45] they did what he said
[32:48] and the net was full of fishes
[32:51] so
[32:53] when they brought the fish in and so
[32:55] forth jesus told them to come and die
[32:59] amen
[33:01] and as they you know probably fellowship
[33:03] sitting around
[33:05] jesus didn't point to
[33:08] um the different ones that were there
[33:11] the bible tells us that
[33:13] you know it wasn't just peter peter told
[33:15] him let's go fishing
[33:18] and the rest
[33:19] several of them
[33:21] said okay we'll go too we'll go with you
[33:25] what happened when jesus met simon peter
[33:28] those they were fishing
[33:30] and jesus said drop your nets and come
[33:32] in what
[33:33] follow me
[33:36] so here
[33:38] it was an occasion that peter had denied
[33:41] the lord
[33:43] three times
[33:47] he denied the lord three times
[33:50] and i i i'm thinking that
[33:53] we're talking about manifested sons of
[33:55] god and the expectation of things that
[33:58] ought to be and who we ought to be in
[34:00] this the hour that we're living in
[34:03] as sons and daughters of god but yet
[34:07] there
[34:08] are certain challenges that we have
[34:12] the question
[34:14] love it thou me
[34:16] here's peter the man with the keys
[34:22] jesus didn't call him simon he said
[34:25] bless of the loud simon with johnner
[34:27] flesh and book
[34:28] then he's going to call him peter
[34:32] okay so he hasn't he has a name change
[34:34] but
[34:35] because of his action his name was going
[34:37] back to who he was son of jonah
[34:41] simon son of john
[34:43] so jesus knew
[34:45] i'm not calling you peter i'm calling
[34:47] you
[34:48] i'm not calling you cephalus
[34:52] amen
[34:54] i'm not calling you
[34:57] i'm i'm i'm calling you
[35:00] simon
[35:02] i'm not calling you peter
[35:07] okay so by the grace of god
[35:10] things happen in our lives
[35:13] un beware and jesus had told him you're
[35:16] going to deny me
[35:18] three times before the clock crow
[35:21] but peter cursed i mean
[35:24] peter denied he said lord all
[35:27] forsake you i won't
[35:30] we can be so determined in our faith
[35:32] that lord
[35:33] i don't care who stopped
[35:36] i don't care who stopped following you i
[35:38] don't care who don't believe you lord
[35:40] i'm going all the way
[35:43] so we can have that independent
[35:44] confession
[35:46] and he told peter flesh and blood is not
[35:47] to reveal this unto thee but my father
[35:49] which is in heaven upon this rock i'll
[35:51] be in my church
[35:53] are you with me
[35:56] so so by the grace of god
[35:59] and i give you the keys
[36:02] he entrusts him with the keys to the
[36:03] kingdom whatsoever you're bound on earth
[36:05] you're blind in heaven whatever you're
[36:07] loosing her
[36:08] elusive you got the keys man
[36:11] the man with the keys
[36:13] curse swear
[36:15] i don't
[36:19] shouldn't this love be questioned
[36:24] see sometimes your love has to be
[36:26] questioned do you really love it
[36:29] do you really love the lord
[36:33] it comes to those times when
[36:36] you say yay lord i you know i love you
[36:40] but your action
[36:42] peter had fallen from grace
[36:48] he had done something that was
[36:51] with the keys can i trust this person
[36:55] but jesus knows all things don't he
[36:58] but yet he was gonna
[37:01] let it sink in with peter
[37:06] and sometimes i think things ought to
[37:07] sink in with us
[37:12] love without me more
[37:15] than these
[37:20] now we know that
[37:24] let's just read a little bit of the
[37:26] first part and after these things jesus
[37:29] showed himself against his disciples at
[37:32] the sea of tiberias
[37:35] and on this wise showed he himself and
[37:39] there was gathered together simon peter
[37:41] thomas called didymus nathaniel
[37:45] of
[37:46] canaan in galilee
[37:48] and the sons of zebedees
[37:51] and two other disciples you see
[37:55] and simon peter said in third verse
[37:58] unto him them
[38:00] i go fishing i'm going
[38:02] fishing you know
[38:05] the bible tells us that jesus appeared
[38:09] to them while it was fellowshipping he
[38:10] came through the door and
[38:12] and tom thomas died and said who and
[38:15] thomas said my lord and my god but
[38:20] do you think after so many times god
[38:23] showing his resurrection that he's risen
[38:25] and all of that
[38:27] and then all of a sudden we're still
[38:28] going
[38:30] fishing know
[38:32] i'm going fishing
[38:35] you know sometimes we forget what god
[38:37] called us
[38:39] our position and what god called us to
[38:41] do
[38:43] but he says i go fishing and look at the
[38:45] rest of them
[38:47] hey we're going to
[38:50] we're going to go too
[38:52] so
[38:54] you know if you falling from grace
[38:58] nine out of ten feel when a person
[39:00] backslide or fall from grace you find
[39:03] themselves going back to do what they
[39:05] used to do
[39:08] are you
[39:11] maybe that that was their trade that's
[39:13] the way they made money
[39:14] you know i'm saying let's go back to
[39:16] work
[39:20] some of the brothers told me
[39:22] when the prophet died a lot of people
[39:24] were looking for the coming of the lord
[39:26] and when the lord did not come
[39:28] some
[39:30] went to their several professions and
[39:32] everything and
[39:33] and then you know people began to
[39:37] even though the lord was blessed
[39:38] financially
[39:40] a lot of people were living you know
[39:43] maybe an apartment no matter who's
[39:44] bringing in thousands of dollars all
[39:46] they want to do is get the gospel
[39:49] then it came to a point where everybody
[39:51] got a little relaxed
[39:52] folks was getting rich folks it's going
[39:55] back to work and all kinds of stuff
[39:58] and after a period of time
[40:01] i believe
[40:02] that
[40:03] that fire
[40:05] that anticipation on the coming of the
[40:07] lord
[40:08] everything kind of you know dwindle
[40:11] and i remember how fired up this area
[40:14] was uh
[40:15] with the lord the coming of the lord it
[40:18] lord might come any time
[40:21] all of a sudden you know
[40:23] now look what had happened they
[40:25] crucified the lord but god had come back
[40:27] and appeared to them
[40:29] and
[40:30] then he told them to meet him and got a
[40:32] lead and so forth and but a lot of times
[40:34] in the midst of
[40:36] the coming of the lord and
[40:38] god
[40:40] doing things in our lives
[40:43] and meeting us and showing us his
[40:45] resurrection power
[40:47] is not enough for us to see that he's
[40:49] arisen
[40:50] see because we could see hey this jesus
[40:53] he's a rhythm but something we must
[40:56] experience the resurrection
[40:59] as individuals we got to have that
[41:01] experience ourselves
[41:04] are you with me
[41:07] so
[41:09] god wants to go a little farther a
[41:12] little bit more in depth with you
[41:15] and get your attention do you really
[41:17] really love me
[41:20] do you really love me
[41:22] more than these
[41:24] now it could have been that he was
[41:26] saying more than these more than these
[41:28] fellows that you're hanging out with
[41:31] fishing with
[41:34] your brother one of the fishermen
[41:36] do you love me more than these
[41:40] maybe it could have been that he said
[41:42] these he was talking about you got this
[41:44] boat and you're going back to your trade
[41:46] more than your job your lover down me
[41:49] more than these
[41:52] you know
[41:53] just what was he you know
[41:56] you know it's speaking to you tonight
[41:57] and god putting this on my heart love
[42:00] without me more than these
[42:08] more than
[42:10] you know
[42:10] we talking my capstone headstone
[42:13] you know when i was thinking about god
[42:15] is that great fountain of
[42:17] love
[42:19] amen and out of love comes forth his
[42:22] attributes and his character
[42:25] amen
[42:27] and his character is expressed because
[42:30] perfect love is in you then it can bring
[42:33] forth the divine nature of god
[42:36] because that divine nature comes from
[42:38] the fountain
[42:40] are you with me
[42:44] let me try to
[42:46] get it all in
[42:48] i don't know how to do it
[42:50] but just pray for me amen
[42:56] he didn't say
[42:58] do you fear me
[43:02] are you with me
[43:03] some people are coming to church only
[43:06] because of the fear of god
[43:09] they don't want to go to hell
[43:13] he didn't say do you fear me
[43:15] are you are you afraid to go to hell
[43:19] he didn't expected that he said
[43:22] simon
[43:24] son of jonah do you love me
[43:29] you know
[43:31] i i've seen a lot of marriages a lot of
[43:34] people got married
[43:36] but they don't love one
[43:37] another
[43:39] and consequently
[43:40] it don't work out they marry for
[43:42] different reasons
[43:44] a lot of times the marriage just don't
[43:46] work out if you don't love the person
[43:52] and i've seen that
[43:56] that when a little bit of trials
[43:59] somebody loses jobs somebody helped fail
[44:02] or whatever
[44:04] the love is gone
[44:08] you see what i'm saying
[44:09] you said is that real genuine it's
[44:12] supposed to be genuine christians to do
[44:14] that too
[44:16] we know the world would do that
[44:19] but our love would be tested and showing
[44:22] off peter love
[44:24] i mean the man walking around with the
[44:25] keys to the kingdom
[44:27] i got the keys to the kingdom
[44:29] and yet
[44:31] he denied him
[44:35] you know if you would have been one of
[44:36] those disciples that saw
[44:38] uh feed five thousand saw ladders raised
[44:41] from the dead saw all these miracles and
[44:44] you know the people in the prophet days
[44:46] they saw all these things and all the
[44:49] miracles all the wheelchairs and all the
[44:52] all these things if you was one of those
[44:55] ones that seen all of that
[44:58] would you curse and swear that you don't
[45:00] even know the man
[45:04] you know some of us you know have
[45:06] experienced certain things in our lives
[45:10] and certain things that we've
[45:11] experienced
[45:14] jesus has done certain things for us
[45:17] as individuals
[45:20] but the question tonight
[45:23] loveth out me
[45:25] more than these
[45:29] more than these
[45:31] and he said
[45:33] um
[45:42] i won't read all of that
[45:44] i just go somewhere else
[45:48] loving him because you're free i mean
[45:50] serving him because you fear him
[45:54] you know sometimes he didn't say
[46:00] do you fear me
[46:03] do you trust me
[46:05] do you honor me
[46:08] do you admire me
[46:12] but he says
[46:13] do you love me
[46:20] you know it's not how much we wept and
[46:22] we've cried
[46:24] because a lot of people
[46:26] you did
[46:28] you know they weep and they cry
[46:32] and and
[46:33] and they say i love you and all
[46:36] i mean they weep they cry
[46:38] oh lord
[46:42] but do you love me
[46:49] what are you willing to forsake
[46:54] what are you willing to give up
[47:00] god's servant said forsaken all
[47:03] to follow him
[47:07] are you willing do you love him enough
[47:10] to forsake everything
[47:15] that's a question brother sister friend
[47:19] do you love him enough to forsake oh you
[47:21] know i see why god asks us to come
[47:23] together
[47:24] because it's just a this is a test
[47:28] because how how else is god going to
[47:30] examine our of love for him
[47:34] there's certain things that god does
[47:37] and we hear the word and and the word
[47:39] comes to find us out to help us along
[47:42] our journey
[47:43] the word comes to
[47:45] the tests our faith out it comes to
[47:48] examine us and see whether we be in the
[47:50] faith
[47:51] they come to prove us
[47:53] it comes to tests and trials
[47:56] amen
[47:58] and the word of the lord tried them
[48:03] okay
[48:04] so he says
[48:06] jesus one time said except for man
[48:08] forsake his father's mother
[48:12] even his own self
[48:15] you see what i'm saying sometimes you
[48:17] love
[48:18] you love yourself more than you love god
[48:24] love without me more than these
[48:26] peter he was scared
[48:29] god that was going to kill him
[48:32] so he was worrying about what
[48:35] himself
[48:39] see what i'm saying
[48:41] what if you were there warming by the
[48:43] fire and the dancer came to you
[48:46] well you're with the man you said oh no
[48:49] how deep is your love
[48:52] how rich is your love
[48:56] how
[48:57] how would your love stand up like peter
[49:00] you saw what happened to peter
[49:04] now if your love was tested and tried
[49:07] would it stand the test
[49:10] or would you just you know sometimes we
[49:12] don't even have to say that we know
[49:14] sometimes we fail
[49:18] are you with me
[49:20] we know sometimes we are not where we
[49:22] ought to be
[49:24] you know we supposed to be further up
[49:26] the road than we are
[49:29] we know in our lives that we can do
[49:31] better
[49:34] yes sir
[49:40] god has entrusted peter
[49:42] he's given peter a charge and he's given
[49:44] us a charge as the bride of jesus christ
[49:47] as manifested sons of god in this hour
[49:51] god has
[49:55] endured he's given us power
[49:59] he's trusted and given us authority
[50:02] he said i'm a trusting you
[50:06] and i'm giving you
[50:08] praise god
[50:10] the keys to the kingdom
[50:13] amen
[50:14] i'm entrusting you
[50:18] that you might be a distributor of
[50:20] eternal life
[50:24] that men would believe on me through
[50:26] their word
[50:28] through your word
[50:30] that you can impart eternal life
[50:36] a vessel that god can use to impart
[50:40] to speak the words of life
[50:45] use you as individuals yet you don't see
[50:48] your position
[50:52] you don't see the reality
[50:55] of who you are in your mission
[50:58] let's go fishing
[50:59] [Music]
[51:03] yes that sounds good man let's go
[51:05] fishing
[51:07] i better not say
[51:09] the other word y'all got me
[51:12] i didn't say that i heard it now i won't
[51:15] dare say it
[51:16] but let's go
[51:19] okay
[51:22] see where we are
[51:24] what what
[51:25] love it love me
[51:27] more
[51:29] than these
[51:31] just think about it
[51:33] love it on me more than these what is it
[51:38] what
[51:39] is god saying to me
[51:41] what do i need to forsake
[51:48] now i said he even come down to denying
[51:51] one own self
[52:00] you know it was a test of peter
[52:03] those that do not truly love christ
[52:06] would never truly
[52:08] love souls of men
[52:14] are you with me
[52:16] how can you
[52:19] love
[52:20] say you love god
[52:22] and hate your brother
[52:26] are you with me
[52:27] you cannot love god and hate your
[52:30] brother
[52:34] you can see in peter's ministry and the
[52:38] charge that god has given to him
[52:42] to feed
[52:43] my lamb
[52:45] to feed my sheep
[52:48] but how can you feed them
[52:50] if you don't love me
[52:55] i cannot entrust you with these keys now
[52:59] i might have to take these keys back
[53:03] but i'm questioning you
[53:05] and i want you to think
[53:08] i want you to think deep
[53:12] can i trust you peter
[53:15] will you do it again
[53:18] you know peter must have you know when
[53:20] he's acting the second time
[53:22] by the time he asked him the third time
[53:24] peter probably thought
[53:30] i believe he was grieved
[53:34] i believe he was grieved
[53:36] let me let me do something i'mma skip
[53:39] skip way over in this message and i'm
[53:41] gonna go to second corinthians seven
[53:48] see sometimes god has to go a little
[53:50] deeper
[53:51] because sometimes we don't understand
[53:53] what god is really asking us
[53:58] but he has to show us and
[54:00] and i can see peter mine reflecting back
[54:04] now
[54:06] he asked me three times and i denied him
[54:09] three times
[54:12] so he gets to conviction
[54:15] it gets down inside of him
[54:18] where he's dealing with what he had just
[54:20] done
[54:22] see god wants you to deal with what
[54:24] you're doing
[54:27] deal with it now
[54:30] and i want you to absolve
[54:34] just think how it must have made jesus
[54:37] feel
[54:38] to see peter do what he did
[54:43] but now he's working with peter come on
[54:46] i saw what you did
[54:49] but i'm trying to get you back
[54:52] to where you need to be because i got
[54:54] something i want you to have
[54:57] praise god
[54:58] you're getting him ready for the holy
[54:59] ghost so you're with me
[55:02] see god got to get you ready for the
[55:04] holy ghost so you got to get your right
[55:09] praise god because you can't go up in
[55:11] the upper room amen with all this
[55:13] fishing on your mind
[55:17] are you with me
[55:19] praise god you got to get rid of that
[55:20] fish you got to come to the calling that
[55:23] i call you for
[55:25] praise god the the will of god for my
[55:28] life i got to let you be first lord
[55:32] do i love you
[55:35] more than these
[55:37] do i trust you do i love him
[55:42] so
[55:43] in second corinthians seven
[55:46] and eight
[55:48] he says
[55:51] for though i make you sorry
[55:53] with a letter
[55:56] and do not
[55:58] i do not repent
[56:01] though i did repent
[56:04] for i perceive that the same epistle
[56:07] has made you sorry
[56:10] though
[56:11] it were
[56:13] but for a season
[56:17] see sometimes the word
[56:19] hits you pretty hard it'll make you
[56:21] sorry
[56:25] are you with me
[56:26] it's meant to be that way
[56:30] that's what paul said i do not repent
[56:35] are you with me
[56:37] somebody said well uh you need to
[56:42] now he wants you to
[56:43] jesus didn't have to i'm not stopping
[56:46] here peter
[56:47] do you love me
[56:50] and god ain't not gonna give up on you
[56:52] so easy
[56:56] amen
[56:57] you know a lot of things the corinthian
[56:59] church was putting up with
[57:05] paul told them he hounded
[57:11] one had his father's wife
[57:15] and he said put him out from among you
[57:22] you know paul could have put him out but
[57:23] paul lingard put him out he told them to
[57:26] put him out
[57:29] are you with me
[57:30] so oftentimes
[57:32] people want paul to do it paul paul was
[57:35] going to come to get on them because he
[57:37] told them to do it
[57:41] but they had to have enough grace to
[57:43] have enough nerve to put that person out
[57:46] that did that
[57:51] oh you hooked me
[57:53] and sometimes
[57:54] it comes down to the church taking amen
[57:58] on
[58:00] their ambassadorship
[58:04] and standing up for christ
[58:06] and doing the things that's going to
[58:08] help one another
[58:11] and don't let all the responsibility
[58:14] come on
[58:15] the ministry but let's
[58:18] be helpless one of another
[58:20] even though it might hurt
[58:23] let's help one another
[58:28] it says
[58:30] now
[58:31] i rejoice
[58:33] not that you may
[58:36] that you were made sorry
[58:43] but that ye what
[58:47] see
[58:48] sometimes
[58:50] people say well
[58:53] i did something forgive me
[58:59] i got to forgive you because the lord
[59:01] said forgive them
[59:04] you got to forgive me you know some
[59:06] people
[59:07] they just pick at you and pick at you
[59:09] and and then they say you got to forgive
[59:12] me
[59:13] i just say i'm a preacher you should do
[59:15] me like that look at me
[59:17] he said
[59:19] you got to
[59:20] you know
[59:22] and you have those that do those things
[59:24] but you know
[59:25] that's not wise to do anybody like that
[59:28] that's not christian like to do anybody
[59:30] just pick on people
[59:33] but nevertheless we want genuinely
[59:36] repentance
[59:39] sorry
[59:41] not see peter had to come where he was
[59:43] greed
[59:46] the bible said he was grieved
[59:49] and said lord you know my heart
[59:52] and you know that i love you lord
[59:56] so you got to come to conviction not
[59:59] is you and the lord you and the lord
[1:00:02] before you can actually love your
[1:00:04] brother
[1:00:06] or one another you got to come to grips
[1:00:08] with
[1:00:09] your love for god
[1:00:12] and you got to let that ankle with
[1:00:14] inside of you lord you know i love you
[1:00:19] and it's got to come down deep and it
[1:00:21] got to come from the heart where
[1:00:23] you know somebody can you know
[1:00:26] go and sin and do something
[1:00:29] and they might
[1:00:32] yeah i did it for what you gonna do
[1:00:34] about it
[1:00:36] you know
[1:00:39] what the church gonna do about it i
[1:00:40] don't care if the church don't like it
[1:00:41] yeah i did it
[1:00:47] and the church looking we got to forgive
[1:00:50] yeah no you don't have the bible paul
[1:00:53] says
[1:00:56] now i rejoice not
[1:00:59] that you were made sorry
[1:01:01] but that ye sorrow
[1:01:04] to what
[1:01:10] i want you to be
[1:01:12] sorry enough to repent until repentance
[1:01:17] until it turned your whole life around
[1:01:21] are you with me
[1:01:23] true repentance
[1:01:26] true confession
[1:01:29] that you're sorry unto repentance
[1:01:33] say some people sorry i've done it but
[1:01:36] sorry until repentance
[1:01:40] that you repent of the things that
[1:01:42] you've done
[1:01:47] too many times
[1:01:50] okay i'm saying
[1:01:52] simon
[1:01:54] do you love me
[1:01:56] more than these
[1:01:59] are you truly in love with god or you
[1:02:02] love
[1:02:03] the things of this world more
[1:02:07] are you loving whatever that thing is
[1:02:09] more these more
[1:02:12] of this more
[1:02:15] of that more
[1:02:17] love it thou me more than these then i i
[1:02:20] want you to come to true
[1:02:22] recognition that i am putting something
[1:02:25] in front of god
[1:02:28] and i love this more than i love god
[1:02:32] and when i can come to reality you know
[1:02:35] peter it was dealing with his life
[1:02:41] i i i don't know the man i i don't know
[1:02:44] him
[1:02:48] i'm talking about dealing with your soul
[1:02:52] do you love god
[1:02:54] in such a way amen
[1:02:57] that you're willing to die
[1:03:00] whatever it takes lord i love you
[1:03:04] i love you more than these
[1:03:08] i believe i believe he had to be
[1:03:10] re-examined
[1:03:11] because somewhere along the line
[1:03:14] something has shook his faith
[1:03:16] i believe we need to re-examine our
[1:03:18] faith i believe we need to check our
[1:03:20] faith out again
[1:03:25] are we really contending for the faith
[1:03:27] that was once delivered unto the sake i
[1:03:29] have our faith is shaken
[1:03:35] peter was not ready to do
[1:03:37] the task that god had given him
[1:03:39] the keys that he had given him he was
[1:03:41] not ready
[1:03:46] and it was showing
[1:03:49] that he wasn't ready
[1:03:51] but jesus told peter at the time he said
[1:03:53] i pray for you
[1:03:55] that your faith fail you're not
[1:03:58] and he knew that peter needed convert to
[1:04:01] be converted
[1:04:03] are you a man
[1:04:05] and god knows that as some of us tonight
[1:04:07] need come to be converted
[1:04:11] he said when you were converted he said
[1:04:13] strengthen your brother in
[1:04:16] when you converted now
[1:04:18] amen i don't care how many devils peter
[1:04:20] those might have cast out how many
[1:04:22] people got healed how many evaluates me
[1:04:25] they went to how much they had preached
[1:04:27] and the devils were subject to and they
[1:04:29] were rejoicing it's the rejoice not
[1:04:31] because the devils are subject but
[1:04:32] rather your names are written in heaven
[1:04:36] so i don't care how many times you
[1:04:39] you know
[1:04:40] it comes down do you love me more than
[1:04:42] these
[1:04:44] because you know we can't go by past
[1:04:46] 10th what we did
[1:04:48] yesterday it's the day
[1:04:50] where are you now
[1:04:55] what's in the way do you love me more
[1:04:58] than these right now where are you
[1:05:02] like he said to adam well down
[1:05:06] and i'm saying well i'm naked
[1:05:09] you know what i'm saying we got to come
[1:05:11] and recognize our spiritual condition
[1:05:15] and we got to be come to grips with it
[1:05:18] loving me more than these
[1:05:29] but ye
[1:05:30] sorrow unto repentance
[1:05:34] sometimes we have to
[1:05:37] look at ourselves and see whether or not
[1:05:39] we can get
[1:05:40] god
[1:05:41] let me let me go he said sorry children
[1:05:44] for
[1:05:46] ye were
[1:05:48] for
[1:05:49] ye were made sorry
[1:05:51] after a godly manner
[1:05:54] see it's got to be a godly manner
[1:05:58] not just i'm sorry
[1:06:01] i'm
[1:06:02] sorry but after a godly manner
[1:06:10] that you might receive
[1:06:13] damage by us
[1:06:16] in nothing
[1:06:18] for what tempers for what
[1:06:24] see not just
[1:06:26] sorry but we want what
[1:06:29] godless sorry
[1:06:31] you know what i'm saying let it be godly
[1:06:34] ah
[1:06:35] yeah i repent i yeah i did something so
[1:06:39] almost like you're bragging
[1:06:43] all y'all can do is forgive me
[1:06:45] ah you can't do nothing but again man
[1:06:51] some folks
[1:06:53] we bring them before the church
[1:06:55] time and time time and time and they
[1:06:58] just keep on coming i committed adultery
[1:07:00] lessons today i committed the doctor
[1:07:02] this day i did this i did that and they
[1:07:04] just keep coming for the church
[1:07:12] but it is a godly sorrow
[1:07:16] the sorry that
[1:07:18] godly sorrow unto what
[1:07:22] godly sorrow working repentance to what
[1:07:27] i'm talking about when you truly
[1:07:28] deliberate
[1:07:32] not
[1:07:33] oh i got well i'm going through the
[1:07:35] order
[1:07:36] you know i'm going through the letter of
[1:07:38] what we're supposed to do but god ain't
[1:07:40] in it
[1:07:43] the letter yes we carried everything out
[1:07:45] straight as the letter said
[1:07:50] but there was no
[1:07:52] deliverance
[1:07:54] deliverance only comes when it's godless
[1:07:57] sorrow unto repentance
[1:08:01] then there's a change in your action a
[1:08:04] change in your life
[1:08:06] well you wonder why sometimes it looks
[1:08:08] like people doing everything just to the
[1:08:10] level just like the word say just like
[1:08:13] the prophet said still amen all kind of
[1:08:15] filth and dirt being known
[1:08:20] they can't seem to be deliberate
[1:08:24] because god ain't in it
[1:08:27] praise god
[1:08:31] it's got to be godly sorry until
[1:08:33] repentance
[1:08:34] whereas lives are really transformed and
[1:08:37] change
[1:08:42] but before

[1:08:47] with the keys

[1:09:09] yourself and the spiritual condition
[1:09:12] that you're in until god revealed to you
