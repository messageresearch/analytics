which was spoken by the prophet joel 17. and on my servant and on my handmaid i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 19. the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon in the blood before the great and notable day of the lord come together and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved or delivered god bless you you may be seated praise god and i was ministering on thursday down the mullins about god said i will amen god's will and i will amen so by the grace of god i want to say i will in relationship to the i mean in god saying he will amen god said i will pour out my spirit amen it's it's not something that we're going to do for ourselves but it's in god's control it's in god's control and i want to i want you to understand that it's god that's doing it amen you know i look at a dead church and look at people that's dead and i i said the reason why they're dead because amen there's nothing to move them there's no fire in them they meant people that are dead need the fire and i i and i was praying this morning god uh what can i do praise god sometimes it takes us uh amen going uh deeper in christ it meant that the fire might be burnt burn uh get hotter you know back in the days when you had the wooden stove amen everybody that can you know was a lot of us and everybody could try to get close to the fire because if you wear it back from the fire you're going to freeze especially when you had the wood stove it wasn't like you got central iron central heat when you had the wooden stove you want to get close amen and that's what it is people amen has gotten so comfortable in the natural to amen they don't need the spirit no more amen but you ought to want to be warm amen the bible talks about peter woman by the wrong fire are you with me when he's denied and cursed and said he didn't know jesus amen praise god but i want you to know amen it is up to you how close you want to get to the fire amen do you want the fire amen of god's word for the word is like a fire do you want it to burn in you praise god when you don't have the fire no more amen you can't not amen folks amen don't want to come to church no more because there's no fire burning in them they make but when the fire is burning praise god take me where the fire is take me where the holy ghost is moving take me where the power is that's where i want to be i want to be somewhere where god is moving why the spirit of god is moving praise god i realize that it's out of my hand i i i i i can't give you the fire but god said i will amen praise god the preacher can't give it just as saying i'm a message believer amen don't mean you have the fire amen praise god hallelujah let me go to ezekiel 36 for a minute and pick it up for a minute amen i'm talking about holy ghost fire this morning god said i will amen not amen something that you're going to do but not something that preacher going to do amen is not something that we say but god is going to do it praise god as i said in mullins or on thursday night it's what god said i'll do praise god he said i'll open your graves up and i'll cause you to come up out of the grave hey god i'll do it praise god ezekiel was in the valley of the dry bones and amen god that the spirit of the lord lift him up and put him in the valley of the dry bones and he said son of man can these bones live thank god but he said lord god you know praise god sometimes amen people get into the very dry spots in their lives praise god when they need the lord and and they need to power god in their life they meant because they become very dry amen but we need to find god to come back in the church amen we need to power god i don't want came in uh uh the fire of a whole lot of screaming and hollering amen but it has no effect on the lives of the people praise god i want the fire ain't meant to be able to burn and pass and sanctifying cleanse give me some fire holy ghost fire praise god not enough just to shout and dance in the spirit amen and praise god and live like the devil are you with me you want the fire to clean up your life amen praise god and that's uh folks claim that they're preaching amen they meant the end time messaging they they claim something that amen it does nothing manifests itself amen but if the word is preached right amen it ought to bring some effects amen it ought to affect you in a you know a life way it ought to cause you to want to live right come on let's just see what it says in ezekiel ezekiel 36 and and 23 he says i will what uh 36 and 23. and i will what god said i'm going to sanctify my great my great name it's about the name amen then i'm going to sanctify my great name praise god god he gonna do something about amen praise god i'm gonna sanctify my great name sometimes the name of god is profane amen we call amen uh uh folk call themselves christians but god said i'm gonna sanctify my great name amen which was

said if you don't live it he said you don't believe it are you with me oh yes i believe the bible i believe no matter i believe this uh-uh if you don't live it you do not i don't care how hard you scream i don't care how much you jump up and down if you don't live it you don't believe it are you with me it's something about this generation i looked at it it's a sad condition as i said the other day in the school and looking at all the carrying on all the fighting and all that going on and i said is there any hope for the children because folks are going mad the teachers can't do nothing about this because the parents at home can't do nothing about it the children are gone it's only one source of help amen god said i will let i wish i can get there but let me just go ahead on he says

gonna wash you in the water of the word amen praise god from all your what i believe we got to get god want to clean us up from all the filthiness too much filth going on sometimes upon people that said he's saving city christian it's a lot of filth filth in the pulpit fit with the music department filter all the way around but god said i'm gonna clean you from all the filthiness amen i believe the holy ghost fire come to do that i believe god when he's in the midst he's come to clean the church come to clean the people up you didn't come to church to be to be filthy you come to church where you can be clean you come to the place where you can get cleaned up praise god not continuing sin he said uh what shall we sin then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound he said god forbid god don't want you to live like you used to live when you out there in the world he wants to clean you up amen so by the grace of god let us let us take heed to okay he says that god says now he said i will sprinkle clean water and and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your what idols will who's gonna do it he said well i what i'm i'm going to clean you see i'm going to tell

we got to look to the one that can do it you know we can try the best out of uh best we can try to live right and try to do the right thing and still we end up in a mess but god said i will i will do this if you oh god but see i'm speaking to everyone but it's not everyone that wanted it everybody don't want to be clean are you with me you can preach amen and you can fast 40 days and 40 nights but

what you do god said i will put my spirit you don't no no man control what god does that's in his control amen and it's something about your ear to hear wait a minute when god speaks to you as an individual amen you can't look around say hey uh what about you uh-uh it's an individual thing god can be speaking to you amen and the one next to you amen they don't hear a thing why because god speaks to the inner man and when god speaks to your heart you amen you obey what god's saying to you are you with me so what happens it's an individual thing so he says and i'll put my what see god has to give you a new spirit and then god put yes and a lot of times folk and you know i always said you need a deeper touch you know sometimes i tell my children you need a deeper touch and i look at people you know you've been walking with the law a long time but you ain't got enough fire your oil might run out at rapture time you need a little bit more fire amen because you know i'm not satisfied when you get satisfied amen the prophet god said you said i have needed nothing that's what the scripture said too but you said i have neither nothing means that you got it all are you with me meaning that you got it all you don't need nothing else so you become satisfied but about you got to keep on pausing not that i've already attained but i keep pressing on that i may apprehend every day you want to get closer to god you don't never come to the place of god i got i got it now amen i'm satisfied a lot of folks just sat back inside the fire and what they do looking at everybody else because they already made it oh what about brother so-and-so what about sister songs and what about that you already made it there's so many people amen well i got the message i got it all i got it all i believe believe the prophet i got it all i i uh how about you as an individual amen are you are you thirsting for more of god do you desire god to do greater things in your life do you want to get closer are you satisfied where you are and that's about that's all you go father you got to go amen and that's what people once you start criticizing others and talk about other folks amen you ain't gonna go nowhere because what others do amen praise god that's totally up to god in them yo individual walk you got to say god i want to get closer god i desire a closer walk with you god i'm praying god give me more i need more revelation i need oh god i need a greater amen praise god walk amen once we get concerned about our own journey amen then god amen begin to give us abundance of revelation let me just go to romans uh nine and and at 11. i got to come to a conclusion here i'm getting late in the evening sun going down i don't preach as long as i used to die darryl used to be preaching an hour and a half i don't preach as long as sometimes it extended two hours praise god hallelujah but god is good isn't that right romans 9 and 11 read for the children being not born not yet born even have done any good or evil i want you to know something sometimes i get burdened i get a little discouraged because people are not responding to the word they're not really you know doing what they're supposed to do and living like they ought to live and you get a little discouraged people look like they put everything before god they come to church when they want and they don't feel like coming in on me they do this do that go here go there all kind of stuff i it's not wrong with going but sometimes to me as a pastor it kind of burden you down because you're expecting sometimes amen that sometimes it's a purpose some people have legitimate reason of need but sometimes we do stuff out of we we need to save a little money we just blowed it then you come a couple you few years down the road so if i only went a little bit more responsible i could have been able to get this or that i'll do this to do that but because i didn't see up the road i thought hey i'm gonna you know it's like the product concern he was he wasted his substance he got in a place where he needed what he wasted are you with me and i want your spiritual walk i want your spiritual walk don't waste this valuable time that god has given you to worship and serve him don't don't spend it foolishly this this is a valuable time that god has given you it's not we're not talking about wasteful in the sense of the carnal stuff but your spiritual ways we waste a lot of god's time precious time that we can give to him i don't know about you but i i feel the need i'm close to 70 years old and i feel a need because i was saying if the lord didn't come at 80. i need to shut down sit down and rest a little while are you with me are you with me but i said well you know if i feel like i feel 9 at 80 then i guess i got to keep on going are you with me but i don't believe the world got that long to be around here but the little time that i got here praise god i want to give it all i got i don't know about you but i i don't want to waste my life and i don't want to be wasteful waste my time here on the earth and spin it with waste don't mean nothing just wasteful i mean just throw it away with righteous living the stuff that don't mean nothing and when i could have done something that was valuable are you with me i i i'm saying spend your life and make let it be valuable let your let your living and your time here let take advantage of your time here and let it be uh kind of worthy are you with me let it be worth are you with me see because a lot of times our lives are spent and we just spend a whole lot of time and you say well i'll tell you the truth y'all have a winner and bought you a nice big expensive meal and maybe spent fifty hundred dollars on it and couldn't eat meaty you ate but five dollars worth you know spent a hundred dollars for five dollar worth of food he said man i could have saved that money i could have bought a grocery you know what i'm saying it's oftentimes we we we do things and it it it ain't worth it amen but if we're only being a little watchful to look careful and a little prayerful we would have done something different oh you know what man the things that are of value to god and the things that are valuable in life amen sometimes we amen we undervalue we undervalue the things that are most valuable and we value that which is not profitable it's not even worth it amen the what we spent on it amen you ever spent a hundred dollars a couple hundred dollars for a past shoes in the hill about the way out within about six months maybe the he'll fall off it maybe holes start getting in the tennis shoes man i bought these tennis shoes they say jordans i get to jump in after i thought i'd jump out the gym you jump up and the rubber start falling off you see what i'm saying man somebody told me there was you know you listen to another voice you bought something that was less valuable and sometimes in our christian walk we make christian decisions based off fulfilling we make christian decision made based off of other folk testimony and how god blessed them with so and so on because they did that but what is for them may not be for you amen so you got to make your own amen let god deal with you and lead you and god you and it struck you are you with me this is an individual journey praise god it might have worked for that one and worked for but it might not work for you because you are not them god deals with us as individuals are you a man so you're individuals okay i got to close but don't read the romans because god is good i'd have slowed down so much but i hope i'm saying something to somebody i hope somebody can hear what i'm talking about because i thank god you know my heart always goes out for the young people and i always want these young people to make it because it's too many young people going to prison there's too many young people like the young lady they said she walked off to miss america or whatever walked off the building in new york and you know 30 years old beautiful young lady lawyer everything going you know what i'm saying but you know look i mean and sometimes that's what fort won what she had a lot of folk spend their life for that but see that didn't vary i mean that one it wasn't that wasn't even worth it to her all that she had accomplished all she had achieved it wasn't even worth it because she was unhappy somewhere you with me so what i'm saying to you you can strive for all these things and they might not be viable and now we all are feeling oh god such a beautiful young lady oh lord i know how a family feels you know you pray for them you know so by the grace of god i want to say to you let's go finish reading roman you don't got to move okay valuable things the things we value are you with me finish reading romans that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger that is as it is written jacob has our love but esau have i hated jacob have i loved and he saw have i hated are you with me go ahead now what shall we say then is there uprighteousness with unrighteousness unrighteousness with god god forbid for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion so then it is not of him that will is nor of him that run it but of god that showeth mercy i will tell you something god has had mercy on us god has had mercy on each and every one of us and because of his mercy we ought to be grateful and thankful to him and if we are not thankful brother and sister you miss your opportunity you miss the one that means so much you if you don't take an op advantage of your opportunity if you don't value the blood of jesus if you don't buy your his dying for your sins if you don't make a solid decision the lord you died for me you you shed your blood for me you came down to oh god did it for you but it's it's all kind of voices out there and things out there that distract you and make you not want to take advantage of the opportunity to give jesus your life so brother and sister i'm saying you need to take an opportunity you need to take advantage of this opportunity that i can get something that's really valuable more valuable than gold more valuable than anything this world has to offer and that is the blood of jesus he wants to give me eternal life and i want to take advantage of it praise god because if you don't then you don't know what you're missing but one day you understand you'll understand i missed out god bless you let us stand a missed opportunity look at somebody said don't miss your opportunity don't miss your opportunity praise god because you may not have this opportunity but once in a lifetime the day might be the the time that god calls you the day might be the day that god says to you that i will bless you that i will strengthen you that i will pull my spirit let us buy his father in jesus name your love is elected father for those that you full knew before the foundation of the world called them by their names for
