[34:17] then a grippa said to Paul Thou Art
[34:20] permitted to speak for thyself then Paul
[34:23] stretched forth the hand and answered
[34:25] for himself I think myself happy king of
[34:28] grippa because I shall answer for myself
[34:32] this day before thee touching all things
[34:35] why I am accused of the Jews especially
[34:39] because I Know Thee to be an expert in
[34:42] all customs and questions which are
[34:44] among the Jews wherefore I beseech thee
[34:46] to hear me patiently my manner of life
[34:50] from youth which was at the first among
[34:53] M own Nation at Jerusalem know all the
[34:56] Jews may God bless the reading of his
[34:58] words you may be
[35:02] seated you
[35:05] know here at the 22nd verse it says you
[35:09] know having therefore obtained help of
[35:12] God I continue until this day witnessing
[35:15] both to small and great seeing none
[35:19] other things than those which the
[35:21] prophets and Moses did say should come
[35:25] that Christ should suffer and that he
[35:27] should be the first that should rise
[35:30] from the dead and show light unto the
[35:32] unto the people and unto the
[35:36] Gentiles amen amen you know tonight by
[35:39] grace of God I just want to minister
[35:41] just for a moment on a testimony amen
[35:44] Amen on a testimony now we looking here
[35:47] at you know we know the scene sitting
[35:50] here you can read it you know sometime
[35:52] at home uh you know this is Paul here
[35:55] and how he's been brought before you
[35:57] know King G gripper and he's being
[35:59] accused of you know the Jews and all
[36:02] about you know and he had a lot of times
[36:05] you know people want to kill him amen
[36:08] some even made vows that they wouldn't
[36:10] eat or so forth till they killed him but
[36:13] so he was being persecuted heavily at
[36:15] this time but even in that I I I Marvel
[36:20] how he says you know to King AG gria he
[36:22] says I'm happy amen I'm happy right now
[36:25] so he begin to tonight I want to talk
[36:28] about a testimony amen and maybe it
[36:31] won't be too long but I I says you know
[36:34] Paul what he was doing right here if you
[36:37] go back and read it he was telling his
[36:40] testimony he he begin to talk about his
[36:43] early life and how he was raised and all
[36:46] but then he began to not only that talk
[36:48] about how he had a Zeal for God and talk
[36:50] about how God met him one day amen and
[36:54] that was that was really the turning
[36:56] point in his life when God met him am
[36:59] you know and that should have been the
[37:00] turning point in each and every one of
[37:02] our Lives amen amen you know uh we can
[37:05] talk about certain things that happen in
[37:07] our life certain things we achieve and
[37:09] all those things but the moment that God
[37:13] came into your life that was I don't
[37:15] know about you but for me that was the
[37:17] Turning Point amen come on you know I
[37:20] think about Moses Moses was Prince of
[37:23] Egypt and all that right he might have
[37:26] had a lot of things he could have talked
[37:28] about or or had but you know what was a
[37:31] turning point in moses' life was when he
[37:33] turned to see that great sight and he
[37:36] met he met the pillar of fire right that
[37:40] that that same man that was born of a
[37:42] woman he'd never be the same again after
[37:46] meet after meeting the burning bush he
[37:48] would never be the same again and
[37:50] everywhere he went he would talk about
[37:52] that burning bush experience come on
[37:55] y'all believe that why because that
[37:57] experience changed his life right in so
[38:01] much as we saying even about Paul here
[38:04] in so much that when he told his
[38:07] testimony it had the the I believe it
[38:11] was anointed it had something in it that
[38:13] convinced people or stirred people to
[38:16] make them even the ones that persecuted
[38:19] him to want to get saved Amen to want to
[38:22] meet the same H uh God that he talked
[38:26] about amen
[38:28] I like that and I said not only not only
[38:31] Paul we've been looking in through the
[38:32] book of Acts that whole early church
[38:35] right they had they had t one thing they
[38:38] had was testimonies amen one thing they
[38:41] had in their lives uh that turned the
[38:45] whole world upside down was they knew
[38:47] how to
[38:48] testify come on they knew how to tell
[38:51] people what what that they weren worthy
[38:54] in and what God had done for them come
[38:56] on they knew not only how to tell people
[38:59] but what it was God was vindicating
[39:01] their testimony why because in all what
[39:05] they were doing they were giving God

[45:36] a lot of
[45:38] people and I might have done it
[45:40] sometimes unintentionally right I said
[45:43] but one person I I just can't see myself
[45:47] breaking my promise with and that is
[45:49] that is Christ amen amen I said
[45:52] because where I was at Hallelujah and
[45:56] where he came and got me from come on

[46:54] and and the boy at work he said Ernest
[46:56] he said nobody can't tell me how good
[46:59] God is he said I know for myself how
[47:03] good God is then he started telling me
[47:06] his
[47:07] testimony and how somebody his his wife
[47:12] and his little baby was sitting out on
[47:14] the porch and the little baby was 7
[47:17] months old and some boys run up to them
[47:21] and held a gun on his wife and his baby
[47:23] and brought him in the house and he said
[47:26] Ern as I I didn't know what to do he
[47:28] said when one of them turned away I
[47:30] dived on them and he said they pulled a
[47:33] gun out and shot me in the
[47:35] stomach he said uh I didn't even realize
[47:38] I was shot he said but my wife did and
[47:41] he says she dragged me and he said I
[47:44] didn't know where I was shot at but it
[47:46] shot her in his stomach and he says but
[47:51] he says it had to be Angels there is
[47:53] what he said he said I wasn't serving
[47:56] God then but he said it had to be God
[47:59] there cuz he talked about how the bullet
[48:02] it shot him in his stomach missed all
[48:04] the the main everything right enlarged
[48:07] in there but he said they just sewed
[48:10] them up so beautifully that you can't
[48:11] even really tell how they had to gut him
[48:14] up and all but he was saying how he from
[48:17] then be to believe that God was real
[48:21] because he said even when I wasn't even
[48:24] thinking about him or even going he says
[48:26] I know that was God hallelujah amen that
[48:29] done that amen come on and I I begin to
[48:32] be stirred while he was telling me his
[48:35] testimony amen amen hallelujah and I
[48:38] said that's what it is don't let them
[48:41] testify allbody s come on amen God saved
[48:45] you for you to tell somebody come on now
[48:49] for you to let somebody know how good he
[48:52] is that's why God brought you through
[48:55] that come on
[48:57] GL he didn't let you go through all that
[48:59] to sit down and don't say nothing about
[49:01] it those early Saints was telling
[49:04] somebody about Jesus amen come on now
[49:07] amen they was wasn't they yes Lord come
[49:10] on but he was telling me that all that

[49:19] was telling so I was telling him my
[49:20] testimoni and more testimonials and he
[49:22] said Ernest he says you know he says I
[49:25] haven't been to church church now in
[49:27] over a year though he says he says me
[49:30] and my pastor we done fell
[49:32] out I said who your pastor is he said TD
[49:37] Jake I didn't mean to call that
[49:41] name but he's he's actually used to go
[49:45] to a church in Mullins his wife is from
[49:48] Mullins and he said that after that they
[49:51] would drive from up here every day to go
[49:54] to Mullins the church in Mullins I mean
[49:55] not every day but every Sunday right
[49:58] just to be in the house of God but he
[50:01] says something happened in the church
[50:03] and it kind
[50:05] of you know offended his his family a
[50:09] little bit so they hadn't been back but
[50:12] he I began to tell him I said oh you
[50:15] shouldn't have let whatever happened
[50:18] knock you away from what God did to you
[50:21] cuz that's what it is don't you know the
[50:22] devil did that come on God God I
[50:26] remember brother Simmons telling me and
[50:28] I I keep telling that testimony he often
[50:30] he told me once
[50:33] that if you be around me long enough I'm
[50:35] going hurt your feelings or I'mma do
[50:38] something you ain't going to like or
[50:40] some stuff you ain't going to agree with
[50:42] he said you might get upset with me or
[50:43] some people in this church you might
[50:45] want to leave the church he said that's
[50:47] fine he said but if you leave the church
[50:50] whatever you do don't leave God amen
[50:53] amen and I thought that was real amen
[50:57] because God ain't never did nothing but
[50:59] be good to you come on man going to fail
[51:03] you all the time come on now your mom
[51:06] and daddy will fail you your brothers
[51:08] and sisters will fail you those close to

[51:16] never fail he said I'll never leave you
[51:18] nor forsake you come on God promised to
[51:22] be with you at all times come on through
[51:25] the thinking then am Hallelujah
[51:29] everybody turn and walk talk about you
[51:33] come on call you all kind of names
[51:35] whatever they false accuse you but one
[51:38] thing I believe Paul could say that that
[51:41] that same light that he met that voice
[51:43] that he heard never left him amen come
[51:46] on now amen and that's what keep you
[51:49] when you keep your eyes on the right
[51:51] thing Hallelujah and that's the one that
[51:54] died for you the one that shed blood for
[51:57] you the one that picked you up out of
[51:59] the market of my reclaim Hallelujah
[52:03] that's what keep you going y'all believe
[52:05] that come on I'm stirred tonight you
[52:08] know one thing about those them and
[52:11] their testifying they wasn't testify
[52:13] with arrogance
[52:15] neither the to make it seem like they
[52:17] had way more than everybody else had but
[52:20] their testimony was on the saving power
[52:22] of Jesus Christ their testimony you you
[52:26] can hear Paul's talk about it all the
[52:28] time was on the grace of God how I'm not
[52:31] worthy to even be a partaker of this
[52:34] Grace come on but if God can save a
[52:37] right one like me Hallelujah it don't
[52:41] matter what you done
[52:42] tonight come on Amen it's the grace of
[52:45] God that we preaching it's the love of
[52:48] God that we preaching come on and
[52:51] that'll draw being into repentance want
[52:53] it come on oh Jesus come on now amen the
[52:57] life you live out to draw somebody to
[52:59] repentance amen come on Amen out to call
[53:03] somebody Hallelujah and want that guard
[53:06] that you got it's got to be that way I
[53:08] believe that your life got to be that
[53:11] salty amen that somebody want they want
[53:13] to know amen what's the source yes where
[53:17] it all coming from hallelujah amen and
[53:20] you can lead him down the calvary I
[53:22] believe that tonight come on but I said
[53:25] a testimony come on
[53:27] I was sharing that and I was talking to
[53:28] boy and then you know he wants to come
[53:31] to church now he says man where you go
[53:34] to church and I explained to he says it
[53:36] ain't that church with that always be
[53:38] got something going on out there in the
[53:39] field I said yeah that was that's us he
[53:42] said oh man I'm coming he said then he
[53:46] started asking me about Doctrine and
[53:47] what y'all believe in so I went into a
[53:50] little little with him right but I said
[53:53] one thing about one thing about it I'm
[53:55] I'm learning
[53:57] that when God is doing something you
[53:59] don't have to add nothing to it come on
[54:02] come on Amen I was freshly telling the
[54:05] testimony how one guy at work he told me
[54:08] a few years ago he didn't believe in God
[54:11] and was questioning me who I'm praying
[54:12] to and all that stuff he was going on
[54:14] and
[54:15] on but some bad storms came in his life
[54:19] come on some things start hitting real
[54:22] hard in his
[54:24] life took him down a bad in dangerous
[54:27] path right
[54:29] but one day he got in the car with me
[54:33] and he saw all these Bibles all around
[54:35] the car and he asked me for one you know
[54:39] just that little move right there he's
[54:42] been coming to me now testifying about
[54:45] what God has been speaking to him come
[54:47] on and you know what I say is one thing
[54:49] about it I'm starting to realize is you
[54:52] know you don't have to mess with it if
[54:55] God is working with somebody you let God
[54:56] do it amen come on and get out his way
[54:59] let God do it come on now God knows
[55:01] exactly what to do he knows exactly how
[55:04] to speak to that person don't he he
[55:05] knows exactly what they need for the
[55:07] time they need it Hallelujah am let God
[55:10] do it I believe it that's what we need
[55:13] more of hallelujah it's God doing it I
[55:17] believe he can do it too come on we
[55:20] still got to pray come on but prayer I
[55:24] believe bring God on the scene amen come
[55:27] on and when God start working just thank
[55:30] God Hallelujah start praising him but I
[55:33] say what it is a testimony come on your
[55:35] life has got to be a testimony y'all
[55:37] believe that tonight I don't want to be
[55:38] long tonight but I says that what it is
[55:41] you
[55:41] know I says I says God you know I want
[55:45] my life to be in such a way that you
[55:49] know it's so it's real
[55:52] salty everybody around you you know they
[55:57] they want what you got come on Amen and
[56:00] what can you talk to them about but the
[56:02] grace of God Amen you know sometimes God
[56:05] can God can do be doing a lot for you
[56:08] and you still cannot be satisfied amen I
[56:11] thought about Israel I said now they had
[56:13] a testimony coming out of Egypt and all
[56:15] that and in the wilderness experience
[56:17] they had a testimony but no matter what
[56:19] God did for him they weren satisfied was
[56:22] they they always found something to
[56:25] complain about didn't it come on in so
[56:28] much that it upset God didn't it right
[56:31] that's
[56:31] right and he told them all of you die in
[56:34] the wilderness come on and the children
[56:38] is said they going into the land but you
[56:40] murmured and you complain so much having
[56:42] I've been so good to you but yet you
[56:44] only open your mouth about what you
[56:46] don't have and what what ain't happened
[56:48] but yes I but I've been don't let your
[56:51] complaints outweigh your praise come on
[56:54] don't don't let your complaints be more
[56:56] in the praise that come out your mouth
[56:58] come on I ain't going to let that happen
[56:59] I said Lord I when it when it before it
[57:02] even come out your mouth let me catch it
[57:04] for it come out my mou turn it into a
[57:06] praise come on because every situation
[57:09] could have been worse if God Hand
[57:11] wouldn't have got on it I believe that
[57:15] Hallelujah come on things happen around
[57:18] us all the time you know I was at at the
[57:21] job I said this been a trying week one
[57:24] of the guys we didn't have to plan
[57:26] didn't even know it but one of the boys
[57:27] fell out they thought he had a heat
[57:29] stroke or
[57:30] something but the whole crew over there
[57:33] responded and we had a meeting the next
[57:36] day and the the big big guy he was
[57:41] thanking everybody said 37 years I never
[57:44] seen a whole crew respond the way y'all
[57:46] did to save that boy's life but I said
[57:51] the thing is I says things can turn in a
[57:55] moment can't it come on you can think
[57:57] you in control and all of a sudden
[58:00] something happened right but that's what
[58:02] it is how can I have like like I said
[58:05] somebody wanted to know where that Joy
[58:07] comes from where that peace come from it
[58:10] ain't from me it's because I know the
[58:12] one that holds it all sir come on I'm
[58:15] serving the one who is the joy Giver I'm
[58:19] serving the one who's the peacegiver
[58:21] who's the lifegiver come on Paul said I
[58:24] know I'm standing here about to be judge

[1:04:31] brother
[1:04:35] Ernest brother Jeremiah those and how
[1:04:40] diligent everybody
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:45] work everybody worked so hard during the
[1:04:47] tent
[1:04:50] meeting and most people was bragging on
[1:04:53] the young people how hard they were
[1:04:56] working said yeah those young people
[1:04:59] working
[1:05:01] hard and they was
[1:05:03] bragging on how hard they work but all
[1:05:06] of
[1:05:08] you how many of you enjoyed the tent
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:17] meeting you know God blessed us with a
[1:05:20] little finances it's very very
[1:05:23] costly you know I was looking at some of
[1:05:27] the hotel bills and I said oo but that's
[1:05:31] all right God is still good a't that
[1:05:33] right and I'm saying it's worth
[1:05:36] it these Hotel bills and then you try to
[1:05:40] be a blessing to the Brethren and all
[1:05:43] but it's worth every penny I believe you
[1:05:46] know some folks I can't afford it what
[1:05:50] can you afford and I this is one thing
[1:05:53] that got on my mind whatever ever you do
[1:05:56] I thank God for all your labor and all
[1:05:58] your support but whatever you do do it
[1:06:01] as unto the Lord don't never do it for
[1:06:05] the church don't never do it for the
[1:06:07] pastor don't never do it for individuals
[1:06:10] do it as into the
[1:06:12] Lord so when you hear somebody the
[1:06:15] quickest way to curse yourself is say I
[1:06:19] did this and I did that and and nobody
[1:06:21] appreciate me and nobody care I I've
[1:06:24] been doing this for so long and uh you
[1:06:27] know no I don't get no recognition and I
[1:06:29] don't this and somebody don't appreciate
[1:06:31] me that's the quickest way to curse
[1:06:34] yourself amen if you want to go down
[1:06:37] quick and you want God to get angry with
[1:06:40] you because you never did it for the
[1:06:44] Lord but if you did it unto the Lord and
[1:06:47] you did it because of God's grace may
[1:06:50] God get all the glory all the money you
[1:06:52] gave all the things you did you is to
[1:06:56] the glory of God Amen and we do it with
[1:06:59] a cheerful heart and we don't
[1:07:01] never well I did this and I when you
[1:07:04] open your mouth like that you lose
[1:07:07] everything are you up
[1:07:10] me I'm faithful the church
[1:07:14] oh I just went through some things
[1:07:18] and and I it's very disturbing because
[1:07:22] every time I look around when people get
[1:07:24] discouraged
[1:07:25] the reason why they get discouraged
[1:07:27] because they can they can think that all
[1:07:29] they done and
[1:07:32] yet our folks don't recognize them and
[1:07:36] all I'm doing for the Lord is
[1:07:40] better to be just as quiet and
[1:07:44] humble and just
[1:07:46] do don't it doesn't
[1:07:49] matter a lot of things that I do that's
[1:07:52] big nobody don't know nothing about
[1:07:56] L they sneak and try to find out if I do
[1:08:01] something big I know not to tell nobody
[1:08:04] cuz they're going to say you crazy
[1:08:05] man why you did something like that what
[1:08:09] wrong with your mind see what I'm saying
[1:08:12] so a lot of times you just keep that
[1:08:15] quiet to yourself and my wife say I
[1:08:17] don't want to know I don't want to know
[1:08:19] I don't want to tell her either she
[1:08:21] don't want to know and I don't tell her
[1:08:24] are you with me
[1:08:26] and likewise when you do don't let your
[1:08:29] right hand know what your left hand is
[1:08:31] doing
[1:08:32] okay but some people real knows it
[1:08:35] they'll find
[1:08:36] out and they'll tell it
[1:08:39] too and they going to make you look bad
[1:08:41] you know what he did he did this did
[1:08:44] that are you with
[1:08:46] me but um I want to thank every one of
[1:08:50] you for your
[1:08:52] labor and this is what um brother on
[1:08:55] Thursday night on last night Elijah came
[1:08:59] up to this uh widow
[1:09:02] woman and she had two sons and they was
[1:09:05] going to put put them in bondage and I
[1:09:08] want to say this he said what shall I
[1:09:11] do to thee what shall I do to thee what
[1:09:16] you want me to do for you and I thought
[1:09:20] about the Saints and working so hard my
[1:09:24] wife said you need do something for the
[1:09:26] Saints they done did something for all
[1:09:28] these people and work so hard you needed
[1:09:30] something but what shall I do for thee
[1:09:35] what can I do for y'all y'all think
[1:09:38] about it and see whether we can do
[1:09:40] something you know as as y'all work so
[1:09:43] hard and labor so hard for everybody
[1:09:45] else well what can I do for
[1:09:48] thee okay that's what I want to ask
[1:09:52] because sometimes you need to feel
[1:09:55] appreciative that somebody appreciate
[1:09:57] you at the same time you know you did it
[1:10:00] to the Lord nevertheless it's if it's in
[1:10:03] our PA to say thank you we want to say
