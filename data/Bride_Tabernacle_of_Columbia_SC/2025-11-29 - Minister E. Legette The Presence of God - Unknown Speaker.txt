Oh Lord, that you might speak, Lord, to your children. Oh God, give us something that'll revive our souls, Lord, and cause us, oh God, to want to run this race, oh Lord, a little bit longer, Lord. We thank you. We love you, and we appreciate you with all our hearts. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Let the church say, "Amen." Amen. God is good. Amen. [music] We want to look at the book of Jonah. By the grace of God, Jonah 1. Try not to be before you long. Amen. Jonah 1 and we'll begin at the the first verse. Very familiar scripture. Amen. Jonah 1 and one. You got it. Say amen. Amen. Y'all got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give y'all another second. Jonah 1 and one. And it reads, "Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amit, saying, arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it, for their wickedness is come up before me." But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarses from the pre from the presence of the Lord, and went to Japa, and he found a ship going to Tarses. So he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them to Tarses from the presence of the Lord. You may be seated. I'm going to read down a little further. But the Lord sent out a great wind into the mighty a great wind into the sea. And there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep. So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him, "What meanest thou, oh sleeper? Arise and call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not." And they said everyone to his fellow, "Come and let us cast lots, and we may know that we may know for whose cause this evil has come upon us." So they cast lots. And the lot fell upon Jonah. Then said they unto him, "Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon is upon us? What is thine occupation in whence camest thou? And what is thy country? And of what people art thou?" And he said unto them, I am in Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which have made the sea and the dry land. Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told them. May God had a blessed reading of his word. Tonight, by the grace of God, I want to talk about the presence of of God. Amen. talk about the presence of God. Now we know that we what we see here Jonah was a man you know called by God and you know sent by God to do a uh prophesied to ungodly nation at that time. Amen. To a gentile nation. But one thing about it I like I was reading here how you know uh it kept saying in the scriptures that he was fleeing the presence of the Lord. He was fleeing. He was trying to get away from the presence, right? And even though even the men here and one thing about it, I was thinking, you know, uh, Harris, Jonah running from the presence of God. And but when the when the ship, you know, when this when the winds got to blowing and the storm got real bad, there something about everybody was in fear and doing their best to keep the ship from sinking. But in all of that noise and all that that had was going on, Jonah was still in the in the ship, but he was sleeping at the time. And sometimes you think like, why why was he sleeping? Didn't all that commotion, everything wake him up? But I believe that one thing about it, Jonah knew why all the commotion was going on, right? Because he was trying to get away from the presence of God. Amen. And we find that today is we want to talk about the presence of God. We find that today that many people try to flee the presence. God's calls on many people lives and you know he's got maybe a work for you to do or he's just calling on you because he wants to do something in your life and but many of times instead of running to God mo many people run away from his presence. How many believe that just as you and I as God called us one day maybe you didn't want to come from the very beginning but God one thing about him he wasn't going to never leave you alone. Amen. He let you run and and go here, go there, you know, but and one thing about God, if he has a calling or something on your life, he going to keep stirring it up, stirring up the wind, stirring up the things, you know, in your life until you come to the reckoning that God, I I know you're calling on me and I'm I'm going to quit running from you. Hallelujah. But it's always been in in man's, you know, a desire many times to run from that presence, right? And you know we find here that God when he was calling on Jonah you know it looked like he would have you know people say if God call me Lord send me I'll go right but many of times you know uh uh you say that within yourselves but God may send you somewhere that is totally against where you want to go right cuz God like we said he could have many of times he could have he could have sent Jonah to his own people to a godly nation to pronounce blessings and all these things but no he's sent them to an ungodly nation, right? To a people that was considered at the time to be gentile dogs. And not only that, he wanted him to cry out against it, right? Come on. And that didn't seem to be appealing at the time. So Jonah, he didn't want to go. But one thing about God, you know, we can't choose, you know, our own uh battles and such things like that. Only thing we can do is learn how to obey God's voice. Because no matter what God wants to do in your life, one thing about it, if the presence, if God is there with you, can't nothing harm you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what I look at. You know, it's something about the presence of God. The presence of God, many people think they don't need that presence. And it's a difference between the presence of God and just excitement. &gt;&gt; Come on. Sometimes people are just excited and they thinking that's the presence, but that's not the presence. The presence of God brings, I believe, a peace about it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The presence of God will bring a peace in the midst of all of what's going on. It's a peace there because the presence of God is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you walk knowing that you got something. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. That you packing something. Everybody like in the in those days when they were in the uh Saul and and Goliath showed out showed up and everybody running and trembling. He had all of Israel trembling. But it was something about David. He is walking with a presence. Come on. I believe he says in the one of the Psalms, "In the presence of mine enemies, thou anointest my head with oil." &gt;&gt; Come on. Yay. Though I walk through the valley and the shadow of death, I won't fear no evil. Why? Because thou art with me. &gt;&gt; Come on. We talking about the presence. When he is there. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's We talking about the presence. We talking about when God is there. &gt;&gt; Not just excitement. Oh, we got we got warriors. Come on. That don't mean nothing, does it? But when the presence is there, right? Come on. It is no giant that'll stand before you. Hallelujah. Because you know that one thing about it, the presence of God makes a difference. &gt;&gt; I like how I was reading here in in uh in in Exodus 33 and how God was telling Moses knows he was saying, "I brought you out of Egypt. I want you to go on up to the land." Right? And he says of the Amorites, Malachites and all those things. And then but Moses began to tell God, he says, "Lord, I'll go." He says, "But if your presence ain't with us, then let me know because I won't go." He said, "Because I I can't go if your presence ain't with us." Right? But one thing about it, even though they were small in number, wasn't even skilled in battle, Moses had an understanding that if God sent us and his presence is there, we don't have nothing to fear. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Why? Because he can look back and see how God sent them as a one-man evasion, right? To go down to Egypt. And what made the difference? Moses in that staff, the presence of God, didn't it? &gt;&gt; So, he began to in his in his life begin to realize that God, I'll go, but Lord, let me know if your presence ain't there. Because God, I can't do nothing without your presence. &gt;&gt; But if you'll let me know that your presence is going to be there and God begin to tell Moses, he says, "My presence will be with you. You got favor with me." Hallelujah. SO, GO ON UP. AND THAT'S A BLESSING, RIGHT? To know that, you know, and sometimes the people around you can't understand the faith that you got. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Sometime a husband or wife can't understand the faith that you got. &gt;&gt; Friends can't understand. But your faith ain't in what what these five senses or the things around you. But your faith is in an almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your faith is in the creator of all creators. So everybody saying, "Man, you must be crazy, right? God ain't show up yet, but you say, no, he might have didn't, but he'll never leave me nor forsake me." Now, come on. He'll be there right on time. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. And even when it looks like there is no hope, when he shows up, there's hope. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is a life, right? &gt;&gt; God brings life to dead situations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He does, don't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. But one thing about it, that's why I love the presence of God. Come on. All the excitement will be all right. But when I tell you what, when the giant show up, when the real devil in a battle comes, that excitement is gone. Then what you going to do? Hallelujah. But when it's the presence, it brings a peace about it, don't it? Come on. Hallelujah. When the when the peace has come, you you learn how to say, "Hey, settle down. Everything going to be all right in the morning." Hallelujah. Come on. I won't be afraid of the the the the terror arrows by day or the terror by night. I won't be afraid of those things. Why? Because I know that God's presence is here. Hallelujah. Many don't WANT TO WALK DOWN CERTAIN roads because they see the like we often say, the valleys and the shadows of death. But if you know that God is with you, hallelujah, not only he's with you, but he's in you and he's speaking and leading and directing your path. Hallelujah. And his word is like a lamp to YOUR FEET. HALLELUJAH. LIGHTEN UP EVERYWHERE YOU GO. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come on. But we find that many people, they want to get away from that presence. But I want to tell you tonight, you need that presence. &gt;&gt; Come on. Like we says, many times you go in uh you go in uh or you might see certain places and uh churches or whatever they jump shout and everybody going come on. But it's a difference now, right? When the real battle, &gt;&gt; the real fight comes, right? &gt;&gt; Where is that preacher that said everybody jump up and shout, everybody do this, everybody do that. Where is he at now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's a difference then, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when his presence shows up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it'll make devils tremble, won't it? &gt;&gt; It'll make situations change when the presence of God show up. And that's what I want more than JUST SAY JUMP SHOT. HAL, COME ON. BUT I WANT THAT PRESENCE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many want that tonight? &gt;&gt; Come on. But many of people, they flee from they they try to run from that presence. But that presence make the difference. You know, I was I was sharing with with uh Charlotte the other day. that was saying, you know, it's something about, you know, you can see God calling on people or you see God dealing with individuals, right? But they try their hardest to run, run, run from that presence. &gt;&gt; I said, "When will they understand that it's God that's calling on them?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I asked the question. I said, "How good does God have to be to people for them to serve them?" &gt;&gt; COME ON, JESUS. &gt;&gt; HOW GOOD DOES GOD BE TO YOU? HALLELUJAH. to serve him. Hallelujah. TO JUST STOP TRYING TO GET YOUR LIFE together and say, "Lord, what will thou have me to do?" HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HOW [screaming] GOOD DOES GOD have to be to you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many times does God have to heal your body? Hallelujah. HOW MANY DARK NIGHTS DOES GOD HAVE TO SHOW UP WITH YOU, RIGHT, FOR YOU TO WANT TO serve God and live for him? Hallelujah. Come on. IT TAKES SOME MORE THAN OTHERS, DON'T IT? BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, if you BELONG TO GOD, HE'LL never stop chasing after you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because you belong to him. Hallelujah. AND ONE BLESSED ASSURANCE, WE KNOW THAT HE'LL never lost one, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; COME ON. ALL THE FATHER'S GIVEN HIM WILL WHAT? [screaming] COME. HALLELUJAH. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; I feel good about that. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God never stopped chasing after me. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm glad that God kept calling on me till one day I was willing with enough courage to stop and say, "Lord, here I am." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING and running and kicking against your will. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. And that's where Jonah came at, right? Come on. &gt;&gt; He ran from that presence, didn't he? Though he tried to get in the ship, PAY HIS WAY TO GO THERE. The pres God knew. I believe God is sitting there laughing. Come on, wind. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, WAVES. RIGHT. SHAKE OUT THE STORM. THE THE the uh the seas a little bit. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. One thing about IT THOUGH, ALL THAT WAS GOING ON, JONAH KNEW. HALLELUJAH. RIGHT. And the people when he began to tell them that I'm running from the presence. That's why all these things are happening. Come on. So they took him and WE KNOW THE STORY. THREW him overboard. RIGHT. GOD HAD A FISH. God prepared a fish, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Took him down. You know, till we I was looking at it. I SAID SOMETIMES GOD got to take you to the lowest to the low, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY ROCK BOTTOM, AS WE OFTEN SAY, ain't the same. But you going to know it when you get there. &gt;&gt; Come on. HAD TO TAKE THEM DOWN TO [screaming] THE LOWEST OF LOW, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO GET THEM TO STOP. HALLELUJAH. And to GET AN AUDIENCE WITH God right there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And say, Lord, come on. I'mma look towards the your your your holy temple. Come on. I'm going look TOWARDS HE CALLED EVERYTHING AROUND HIM LYING VENDES. BUT HOW DID HE GET THERE? HE PUT HIMSELF THERE, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE HE DIDN'T WANT THE PRESENCE OF GOD. HE WANTED TO RUN FROM IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. BUT EVEN THERE, THE PRESENCE [screaming] OF GOD STILL FOUND HIM THERE, DIDN'T IT? HALLELUJAH. OH JESUS. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad. That's one thing. Come on. I said HE NEVER LOST ONE NOW. &gt;&gt; Come on. HE'LL GO TO THE DEPTHS TO GET THAT ONE, won't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Hallelujah. But the presence, come on. I says one thing about it. Come on. How, as we were saying, how good does God have to be? I want to say tonight, you know, you know how good God has been to us. He could have cut many off long time ago. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's the truth. People don't, OH, YOU SHOULD. He could have cut He could have cut me off long time ago. &gt;&gt; Come on. But one thing about God, he's longsuffering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. And you might TRY TO FLEE FROM THAT PRESENCE. MIGHT THINK YOU DON'T NEED IT, BUT ONE DAY YOU'LL COME BACK RIGHT BACK AROUND TO IT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. WHETHER IT'S IN JUDGMENT OR WHETHER IT'S IN MERCY, YOU'LL COME BACK AROUND TO IT. Sometimes people try to stop their ears up because they don't want to hear the voice. Hallelujah. BUT ONE THING ABOUT THAT VOICE, YOU CAN STOP YOUR EARS UP, BUT YOU CAN'T STOP THAT [screaming] VOICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT VOICE WILL KEEP CRYING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. Come on. There's something about THAT VOICE. AND NOT ONLY NOT ONLY YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD. I mean man, come on. But that's one thing. But one thing about THE VOICE OF GOD, IT HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE MOUNTAINS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. IT IT GOT THE ABILITY TO SHAKE YOUR INNER CORD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT THE ABILITY TO TO DROWN [screaming] OUT ALL THE NOISE THAT'S AROUND YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND SPEAK TO YOUR SOUL ONE DAY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. You know, one thing about I'm stirred. I says one thing. We're talking about that shaking. I says, you know, I dreamed and I dreamed again the other night. You know, I dreamed that I says I was at work and it and as we started feeling we thought it was an earthquake at work here, but it was it was the aftershocks of earthquake that had just hit California and we felt it all the way over here in west in in in Lexon. So I called Charlotte. I says, you know, hey, she was saying, yeah, a big earthquake just hit California and we feeling the aftershocks of it. I said, man, if it's that big, I asked her, I said, is the house still standing? For some reason in my mind, that's what I was thinking about. But I told her, I said I says, I'm afraid to look at the news cuz if it was, if we could feel it all the way over here, it ain't there no more. That's how big that earthquake was. But then I dreamed again like two nights ago maybe. But another big one hit and it was bad bad out in California. But what it is I says what what is God? Come on. Sometimes oh just a dream but I want to tell you dream is going to come true one day. Come on. But I want to say one thing about it. It could shake but it can't shake you out that presence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If God's got your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's got in control. Come on. One thing about HE CAN'T TAKE YOUR SOUL NOW. HALLELUJAH. SHAKE ALL IT WANT. BUT ONE THING I KNOW, IT CAN'T SHAKE ME OUT OF THAT PRESENCE. HALLELUJAH. DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN GOD'S HAND? And when you're in GOD'S HAND, CAN'T NOBODY TAKE YOU OUT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He said you engraved in A PALM OF MY NO. COME ON. NOBODY CAN'T TAKE YOU OUT. THAT'S MY ASSURANCE. Devil can WOLF DO ALL THIS WHAT HE WANT. ONE THING ABOUT IT, I GAVE MY LIFE TO GOD AND I I'M TRUSTING IN HIM THAT HE'LL KEEP ME. COME ON. I CAN'T KEEP MYSELF. IT'S GOD DOING IT. HALLELUJAH. OH, I'm trusting in God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. How many trusting in God tonight? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm trusting in him in his presence. Hallelujah. You can have all THE EXCITEMENT, ALL THIS. COME ON. I'M TRUSTING IN THE presence of God. Right. Come on. BECAUSE I KNOW ONE THING. That's what gives me courage. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what gives me faith to know that it ain't no no uh uh uh trial that'll stand before us that'll BE ABLE TO DEFEAT US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PRESENCE IS THERE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know, one thing I I was sharing with the church the other day. I I tell a testimony sometimes. You know, we were at work and uh we was we was talking about how many of times people made commitments to God, but they didn't keep keep those commitments, right? Because they were in situations and they said, "Lord, if you ever get me out of here, I'll serve you. I'll never come back." But you know what happens many of times? God delivered people and what do they do? They forget all about the God that delivered them. But in their time of need, they called on God, didn't they? With all their heart. And one thing about it, you know, God knows all things. He knew you wasn't going to keep serving him. &gt;&gt; But yet, he's all merciful. He delivered you anyhow, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. I said, how good does God be to you? &gt;&gt; How many times God got to bring you out? One time you may call on him AND HE MAY NOT BE THERE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THAT'S THE TRUTH. Come on. But I thank God. Hallelujah. That I know that if I'M STANDING IN HIS WILL, I CAN CALL ON HIM. AND THAT'S A PROMISE THAT HE'LL BE THERE [screaming] EVERY TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But I was sharing I said, you know, one thing about we was talking about that at work and one of the one of the guys, older guy, uh he was saying that he was over in um in uh uh Vietnam and said, "Man, they they had this Vietnamese start shooting at them and said um came out of nowhere, bunch of people, he says from South Carolina was in the platoon and he said that a bunch of them got killed like shot up. Shot up real bad." He says he was laying so low to the ground. He was trying to dig a hole for himself with his fingernails to all his skin was raw and bleeding. And he said he can hear those bullets whizzing by his head. Say he can hear the boys next to him getting chewed up by the bullets. And he says next thing you know he began to pray into himself right then. He said, "Lord, if you get me, let me make it out of this." He says, "I'll serve you when I get back to the States through the all my life." He was he was young then at the time. And then he says after he got done praying, he said he felt like a warmness come above him come about him. He says he don't know what he said he just felt warm all of a sudden. And he said though the bullets was flying past his head and he's so low he just stood up to his feet and just start shooting back at everybody at the enemy, right? And he says not one bullet hit him. He didn't get a scratch, you know, other than what he was trying to dig out there. And he was saying that for some reason well after he got done praying the warmness came right and all the fear left and he started doing things that you would think like oh that's just adrenaline but you know WHAT I BEGAN TO TELL HIM THIS WAS BACK THEN I SAID YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WAS THE presence of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; COME ON PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IT SOMETIMES BUT IT WAS THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE? THE PRESENCE of God. HALLELUJAH. THOUGH THE BULLETS WERE ALL AROUND YOU THOUGH THE ENEMY SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU THE PRESENCE WAS THERE. WHAT BROUGHT ON THE PRESENCE? SOMEBODY WAS [screaming] PRAYING. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. &gt;&gt; Praying brings the presence, don't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And it creates a shield around you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. I BELIEVE THAT EVEN EITHER DAY IN 2025, THE PRESENCE STILL WORKS, RIGHT? I mean, THE PRAYER STILL WORKS. PRAYER STILL BRINGS THE PRESENCE. COME ON. WE GOT TECHNOLOGY. WE GOT ALL THESE THINGS. WE GOT OTHER avenues that's supposed to be ways out, WAYS OF ESCAPE. BUT CAN'T NOTHING BEAT THAT PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; THAT PRESENCE WON'T FAIL YOU. COME ON. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN SAY HE'S HERE. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. BECAUSE HIS PRESENCE IS HERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW I KNOW. HALLELUJAH. Oh Jesus. Come on. &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, I said when he was sharing that, I was telling him that's what that's what it is. The presence was there. Come on. AND WHEN THE PRESENCE THERE, come on. Miracles happen. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Excitement don't bring miracles. The presence does. Come on. Excitement. IT IT IT IT DON'T DO DO the miraculous. The presence does. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The the the excitement don't bring joy. The presence does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. And come on. In the PRESENCE OF THE LORD, THAT'S THERE'S FULLNESS OF JOY. THE PRESENCE BRINGS THAT, don't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. How many believe that tonight? Come on. But one thing I say, you need the presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Many found that out that that without the presence there wasn't nothing, didn't he? Come on. Samson found that out one day, didn't he? Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. He might have been doing this and had many uh testimonies and of how the Lord used him and all and thought maybe at one point that he can do what he want because God used me so many times, right? &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, he didn't realize that without their presence, he wasn't nothing. &gt;&gt; But he found out one day, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. on when the presence had left him. Hallelujah. And he said, "I'll go shake myself at other times." But he didn't know that the presence had left him. And when he went out, then he REALIZED HE WAS NO MATCH FOR THE DEVIL. COME ON. AND NEITHER ARE YOU AND I TONIGHT. NO MATCH FOR THE DEVIL UNLESS GOD [screaming] BE WITH YOU. AND IF GOD BE FOR US, THEN WHO CAN BE AGAINST US? &gt;&gt; COME ON. THAT'S THE TRUTH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY WE PRAY ALL THE TIME, LORD, don't take your hands off me. Hallelujah. Oh God, create in me a CLEAN HEART AND RENEW THE RIGHT SPIRIT in me. COME ON. DON'T [screaming] LET YOUR HOLY SPIRIT LEAVE ME, GOD. &gt;&gt; COME ON. BECAUSE THERE'S MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO TO GET THAT PRESENCE TO WALK AWAY FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. Sin brings that about, DON'T IT? DISOBEDIENCE BRINGS THAT ABOUT. &gt;&gt; BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, REPENTANCE [screaming] WILL BRING IT BACK. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's one thing people don't like to do, &gt;&gt; do they? Is to repent. Come on. on. But it'll bring it back, won't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not not these dry eyes and all that. The Lord know your heart, don't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. But a real Hallelujah. I believe like Samson, we was talking about that the other week with the young with a young little group over there. I said one thing about him, he didn't have his eyes, did he? But he still had memories. He still had things he can go back to. And I said, I believe that when they was out there making fun of him, maybe what was he thinking about that whole time? Come on. When he was grinding in the meal, MAYBE HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE GOOD TIMES. HALLELUJAH. When he was going and and next thing you know, come on, God begin moving in his life. HOW DID GOD BEGIN MOVING IN HIS LIFE? BECAUSE WHEN the enemy or danger seemed to come about, COME ON, THE PRESENCE WOULD BE THERE. &gt;&gt; MAYBE HE THOUGHT about when a young lion came after him. Hallelujah. WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD RUN, THE PRESENCE CAME. HALLELUJAH. OH, JESUS. And when that came, instead of HIM RUNNING, HE [screaming] GRABBED THAT LION AND TORE HIM UP, DIDN'T HE? &gt;&gt; COME ON. Don't seem real, does it? But when the presence of God is there, everything is possible. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE IMPOSSIBLE IS POSSIBLE WHEN THE PRESENCE IS THERE, &gt;&gt; ain't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even though he he WAS STANDING THERE NOW WITH HIS EYES OUT, HAIR shaved off, but the Bible says hair begin to grow back again. &gt;&gt; Come on. But even with the hair growing back, he still needed the presence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. WHAT BROUGHT IT BACK? REPENTANCE, DIDN'T IT? I CAN SEE THAT. YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT IT, I believe that he can see where he got off. Come on. IN HIS MIND, I BELIEVE HE CAN START BELIEVEING ABOUT WHERE HE GOT OFF. &gt;&gt; COME ON. HIS PARENTS WAS TELLING HIM MANY TIMES, UH, I WANT THIS YOUNG [screaming] GIRL. WHY YOU DON'T WHY YOU WANT HER? COME ON. &gt;&gt; AND ALL THESE SANCTIFIED JEWISH HOLY GIRLS. YOU DON'T WANT THEM. OH, I WANT HER. I BELIEVE HE THOUGHT ABOUT those things. &gt;&gt; Come on. COME ON. WHERE HE GOT OFF, RIGHT? LITTLE BY LITTLE TO TO THE POINT TO WHERE LOOK AT WHERE I'M AT NOW. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, HALLELUJAH, I BELIEVE HE LONGED FOR THAT PRESENCE TO COME BACK. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; LONG FOR THE I WANT TO [screaming] GET BACK IN YOUR WILL, GOD. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GET BACK TO THAT PLACE TO WHERE YOU COULD USE ME AGAIN. HALLELUJAH. I WANT TO [screaming] KNOW THAT YOU'RE STILL HERE, GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY. COME ON. HE WAS WILLING TO REPENT, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He told that you're a little young lad to lead him. Lead him, right? LEAD HIM TO THE POST, THE PILLARS, RIGHT? LEAD ME THERE. COME ON. BUT IN THAT PLACE, HE SAID, "LORD, STRENGTHEN ME JUST THIS ONCE." RIGHT. ONCE MORE. OH, HALLELUJAH. I want to feel the PRESENCE OF GOD. RIGHT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; OH, THE EXCITEMENT IS GONE. I WANT THE PRESENCE ONE MORE TIME. &gt;&gt; OH, JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I believe you got TO GET THAT DESPERATE TONIGHT. THAT WAY YOU WANT THE PRESENCE AGAIN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. God let things go on wrong, but he know one thing. One day you'll need that presence again. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, when the presence came. Hallelujah. That made the difference, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I say it takes sometimes God does things or let you go into certain things. It takes things to happen for you to realize how important the presence is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU CAN DEPEND ON YOUR OWN ABILITY AND ALL THAT, but you ain't nothing without the presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without him, you can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. That's why we often pray, Lord, keep me in your your pathway, Lord. Like to say, keep me in your will. KEEP ME IN YOUR PATH, GOD. LET ME STAY IN THERE. &gt;&gt; Because the more God blesses, SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET, DON'T THEY? That it's God that brought them. But I said, "Lord, I'll never want to forget that it's you that brought me. That it's you that's keeping me. That's you that's MAKING A WAY." COME ON. I need your presence right now, Lord. Come on. How many need that presence tonight? &gt;&gt; Come on. Many, his presence makes a difference. I THOUGHT ABOUT PETER NOSE AFTER THEY DONE BEEN ALL NIGHT. They ain't caught nothing, right? But Jesus began to tell them, "I want you to go out again." Come on now. WE KNOW WE EXPERT FISHERMEN. THIS IS WHAT WE DO. Come on. WE KNOW WHERE THE FISH WERE AT AND THEY WASN'T THERE. But one DIFF ONE OF THE difference is this time Jesus was going to be WITH THEM. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HIS [screaming] PRESENCE WAS GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE THIS TIME, WASN'T IT? &gt;&gt; OH JESUS. AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TODAY, [screaming] RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YOU DONE DID ALL YOU CAN DO. YOU DONE TRIED. Come on. YOU DID YOUR BEST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IT FAILED. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS TIME, [screaming] LET JESUS GO WITH YOU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WATCH WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES. HALLELUJAH. It makes a big difference. How many believe that tonight? Oh Jesus. I'm stirred. Come on. The presence of God. It makes a difference, don't it? &gt;&gt; Jonah, like we said, was fleeing the presence, right? You know, Adam and Eve found out how much the presence made a difference, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Come on. When they got away from it, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. And the voice of the Lord didn't walk in and say, "Hey, where are thou running from his presence?" Right? What made them run from it? because they had sin in their life, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. They had disobeyed God, right? And that many times will make people don't want to be in that presence because that presence expose things in your life, won't it? &gt;&gt; Come on. But one thing about it, I SAY, GOD, WHATEVER IT TAKES, LET ME GET IT RIGHT NOW. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Come on. I WANT TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE WHEN THINGS begin to shaken. I want to BE IN YOUR PRESENCE WHEN THIS WORLD FALLS APART. I WANT TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE. RIGHT? BECAUSE ONE THING ABOUT IT, IN YOUR PRESENCE, THOUGH THE WORLD HAS FALLEN APART, YOU'LL LIFT ME UP. &gt;&gt; COME ON. IN THE HEAVENLY PLACES, I believe that with all of my heart. How many believe that tonight? Come on. I said, don't run from the presence. Run to his presence. Hallelujah. And let God bless you. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Appreciate the word tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man running from the presence of God. Amen. I hope we are not that one tonight that is running from the presence of God. Amen. But run to God. Amen. Because one day, Amen. If we run now, Amen. that day when the Lord come, Amen. to make up his jewels, he said, "Depart from me. Your work was of iniquity and I don't know you." Amen. But you want to hear him say, "Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this is your opportunity to get it right with God &gt;&gt; and do it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we need to get right right now. &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us just bow our heads. Father in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Father we know that you said delight thyself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.
