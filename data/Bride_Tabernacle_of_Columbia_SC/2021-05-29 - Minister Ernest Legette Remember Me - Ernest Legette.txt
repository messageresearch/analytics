lord you're still keeping a hedge about those that believe father we thank you lord tonight for those things and we ask oh god for your mercy god in your grace bless the word lord help us to move out of the way speak lord to our hearts in the name of jesus christ amen god is good amen we want to look at the book of genesis 40 tonight by god's grace genesis 40. and we'll begin at the let's begin at the 16th verse the story of joseph in the baker and the butler the dream we'll begin at 16th first he says well let's let's move up a little bit in the ninth verse and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said unto and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me and in a vine there were three branches and it was as though it was butted and the blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth right grapes and pharaoh's cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed him into pharaoh's cup and gave the gave the cup unto pharaoh's hand and joseph said unto him this is an interpretation of it three branches are three days yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore unto thee unto that and restore thee unto thy place and thou shall deliver pharaoh's cup into his hand after the former manner and when thou was a form of manner when thou was his butler but think on me when it shall be well with thee and show kindness i pray unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also i have done nothing and that they should put me into the dungeon you may be seated i want to skip down a little bit to the 20th verse and it reads and it came to pass the third day which was joseph's birthday that he made a feast unto unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the chief baker among his servants and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaoh's hand but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgot him may god had bless your reading of his word tonight by god's grace just for our moment i want to speak to you just for a little something that was on my heart and i entitled it remember me amen remember me and i look looking here how how um joseph here in the 14th verse he was saying you know telling the chief butler he's saying you know you're going to be restored you know they both were in a bad place and and down in the dungeon the bible says and that he says you know he says that you're gonna be restored but you know it must have been a pretty bad in that place because you know joseph even in himself he's looking at the the butler and he's saying you know but when you get out of here he says remember me he says don't forget about me you know sometimes we find ourselves in places that that are dark or in low spots and and nevertheless you know we want to be remembered sometimes i like how joseph brought it out he says even i ain't even done nothing even be in this place he says but you know remember me maybe he was in his like they called it the juniper tree experience the way he's nothing looked like it was going right for him but one thing he did do he stayed faithful so i rem i was looking at you know in the age that we live in i says you know when you look around everybody's going through something everybody you talk to somewhat they say remember me in prayer or remember me i was telling a brother charles jr the other day i said you know you always seem to be in in a mode where you have to uplift everyone he says when when one person ain't going through you get that person uplifted then all of a sudden the devil is messing with this one so you get that one uplifted then here come the devil and that says what it is it's always going to be something you know and what it and you say what is it we know that it is the devil but i said as i was talking to a guy at work the other day he was saying you know ernest just looking at certain things and positions and certain things that you're capable of and he was saying you know what i would do i would throw i would throw my weight around i would do this and that and i says you know that's the mind frame as i told him of a lot of people but i says you never take an account of the position just because you up and you can do a person a certain way because they're in a certain position or they down i says because tomorrow might change i said you might wake up tomorrow i said if i'd done certain things act certain ways i said i could wake up tomorrow and i could not even have no knowledge of these things i said that's why i don't look at people and take an account for where they are because the only reason why they're there and i'm not there is by the grace of god so we we learn to to think that way that you know i says that what it is everybody going through something faced with something want to be remembered you know remember me don't forget about me i see joseph say that remember me don't forget about me and i that thought i said you know jesus when he came he says i i come to amend the brokenhearted to preach you know deliverance to the captives that the the the blind might receive their sight in these things jesus he came to to uh uh deliver those because he knew that as a preacher one time a world in pain that people would they would be in that place to go through something that they would be going through something but nevertheless in the in the age or in that place where the people's going through something he's the only answer for the world today how many believe that so you know i was at work and i was telling my wife i said you know something strange happened i says i was getting ready to leave working in the break room i seen i was one of the guys at work he was you know moving all around and he he was in obvious pain like like obvious pain and i says i says hey denzel i said you all right man he said man i got these kidney stones real bad and he says that i says well they can't crushing me he says that he said they said that they was too small or something why they couldn't crush him or whatever he just would have to pass him but he's been battling them for a while but you know it's an obvious pain and i know i had him before kidney stones before and i can i can identify with the pain but as i seen him in that pain i heard i heard something say to me uh lay your hands on them at the job right there in the break room something said lay your hands on them and i was i didn't i was a little nervous and then i heard something say to me didn't i say lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and as it said that i asked him i said you mind if i laid hands on you and prayed with you he looked up at me kind of strange he said yeah go ahead so i laid hands on him and began to pray with him right there and as i got done praying i asked him i said now do you believe in that he said i believe it's a higher power out there so i talked with him a little bit but when i seen him again i was telling my wife them he was around there dancing and everything i said denzel what happened he said oh ernest he said i went home and i passed him that same day yeah i said i said well thank the lord and i said you must be feeling mighty good because you out here dancing he said you did it ernest i said no no no no i didn't do it i said the lord did it i said because he told us he made us a promise that if we lay hands on a sick that they shall recover i said so he done it i says it's all in him and i said and i asked him i said now i said you want to go you're going to go to the doctor to make sure all i'm gone he looked at me and said uh-uh don't speak that on me he said don't speak that on me he said you you prayed and that's it it's over with and i thought about myself i said look at me trying to put trying to put these things back on him but what it is don't you know god is that real you know it was something it was a rebuke to me that god had to say that twice to me you know he says didn't i say lay hands on a sick and they shall recover do you know what that does that's a testimony to our faith that is not in you feeling i got to feel this of power no it's in you being in position and being willing to not be ashamed of the gospel come on because sometimes we're ashamed of the gospel i'm at work and all these things but when god tell you to do something then you move at all costs and watch god back it up i believe that with all of my heart how many believe that but he says you know i say is what it is you know i was thinking about that because my mind was already on that in that way i said everybody's got something everybody's dealing with something you know the world is hurting right now come on and what i was i was telling somebody i almost called a name the other day i says you know it's a lot we got to deal with it's demons fighting people battling and i said look what you called me to talk to me about i said this is nothing come on i said it don't mean nothing i said people are losing their souls people are hurting people need prayer come on and i said we don't have time to do that come on i said but what it is we got to be about our father's business i said i don't know about you but that's what i want to be i don't want to i don't want nothing in the way but when god asks me to move i want to be right with god so he can use me anywhere at any time come on not just saying you but i want to see people delivered i seen that that brother in pain and i know what that pain was like and sometimes you know we can't uh identify with the pain that people going through and that's why we don't extend to him but sometimes that's why i look at joseph and things that he went through sometimes god allows you to go through things then you'll know how to appreciate when you own the mountaintop because you've been down in the valley long enough hallelujah you've been through enough hurt and you've been through pain that when you see somebody else going through you can identify with them you can get in there suffering and you can say brother sister i know what you're going through so when you pray for him hallelujah i like that how it says that christ he was he was tested and tried just like a man from every angle that's why the bible says he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he knows what we're going through when he sees the the the pain that we're in he can identify with that pain hallelujah and he can get down where you're at and get right in there and bear those burdens he can say cast all your carols upon me because i care for you it's nothing like somebody praying for you that know what you're going through that they've been there they can get down in prayer for you and get a breakthrough lord pull them through hallelujah how many believe that so that's what we do we look at the trials that we go through come on and we don't complain why me hallelujah but when god brings us through then you're looking to testify that you can tell somebody else that if god did it for me then i know that god will do it for you if god can save me hallelujah then he can save anybody if he came i like that song and a sister saying she says maybe you never felt lost and alone or one day that a burning hell would be your home maybe you never felt that you needed someone to set you free but i know hallelujah i'm one of those that needed him and he might have not done it for you but he did it for me hallelujah and i can identify with the struggles and the pain that you're going through hallelujah how many thank the lord tonight that we serve a god that don't just sit high and he ain't been there he said but i've been there i know what it's like to be persecuted i know what it's like to be talked about and be spit on to be rejected by your own people come on somebody says my own family rejecting me god know what that's like come on they talking about me jesus knows what that's like they rejecting me jesus knows what that's like hallelujah he says walk that lonely road how many feel that way tonight but i said god is good amen remember me come on how many want to be remembered tonight i says that we can be remembered by a lot of people but to be remembered by god come on you know he says that you engraved in the palm of his hand come on he i like that how he says all the father's given him they'll come come on he never lost one you know god ain't gonna forget him is he they can be in the lowest pit god will remember god are remembering that hey i knew them before the world began they were in my mind the devil got hold of them but i remember them come on i recognize them i i recognize the seed that i placed in there hallelujah so house of hell give way to the name of jesus whatever is on their life remember i says that if the seed of god is in there no matter what condition they're in you can see those shackles falling off you see those demon powers they got to give way to the name of jesus thank the lord for that what i said is what it is remember me i said you know everybody want to be remembered you know but we find joseph i i just sitting there meditating on joseph and i said you know he was in he was in a in a place i ain't even done nothing to be here come on he said and then looking at unbelievable asking them hey god getting ready to restore you but when you get there don't forget about me help me to get out of this place where i am come on he said i was stolen away but one thing i like about joseph and all of that he still was faithful to god god i don't understand why i'm in this place right now i don't understand why i got to go through this pain right now but i do know one thing imma stay faithful because i know that one day you'll see me out of here one day you'll remember me hallelujah and when god remembers you i like how joseph when his brothers and them came to him he says no it wasn't you that done that come on he said but it was god the whole time god put me in that place god placed him in that place he said he sent me here but before you to do what he says that a lot of lies can be saved today i went through all of it for the glory of god come on he can look back and see that it wasn't wasn't them but it was god the whole time how many want to how many can look back over what you're going through come on it might be hurting in pain right now but come on it was god come on god wants to use you god wants to use your testimony because somebody else somebody gonna struggle and they'll break hallelujah because they ain't strong enough sometimes you say it that like that but when they hear what god done for you that gives them strength to go on i believe is power in your testimony i believe your testimony got power in it that it's going to be something come on to to help someone to get from where they're at how many believe that tonight but we find that i says i says remember me come on you know what it is you know like we said maybe joseph was in that you know in a juniper tree or whatever experience so we find that eve but even in that like i said he was still faithful and we find ourselves from from i believe that from the pulpit to the back door we all find ourselves into those places you know i believe it was nehemiah and one of those uh forget who which one was what he says he says lord he says enlarge my territory god i want you to bless me come on because away is faced with so we we find ourselves in those places sometime where we're reaching out come on lord as you forgot about me come on what about me lord what everybody else around me and sometimes you you look say everybody prospering hey remember me come on in prayer but god ain't forgot about you i thought about john the baptist and how you know it was something how when he even after he baptized jesus and jesus went on and getting his own disciples and doing his own things and his disciples came up to him and said john the one that you baptized look at him he got people just paraphrasing it falling behind him come on and baptizing and all like that it's that's so to say he ain't even recognizing you you you open the way for a made the way and he don't even they don't even remembering you come on sometimes it feel that way but john rebuked he says did not i tell you come on dad he was the one he says the the the bridegroom the one who has the bride is the bridegroom he said he must increase as i must decrease it ain't about me come on i served my purpose god ain't forgot about me come on i did what god asked me to do it's not about me get that out your minds hallelujah but it's about him but yet we find even john when he went down into the prison you know i believe he might have got a little discouraged or confused that i'm in prison and jesus didn't even come visit me come on down in his place he said ask him is he the one or shall we look for another come on maybe wanting to be remembered but john jesus began to let him know the disciples i ain't forgot about him go show john the things you see me doing come on and he'll be able to identify what i'm doing hallelujah he says i tell you what you go to see a reed shaking in the wind come on or just this and that no he said a prophet he said no but i tell you greater than that he says that there was no man born of a woman greater than john the baptist you go tell him i ain't forgot about him hallelujah but i remember him and one day i believed hallelujah that john can go down in victory knowing that like like the brother senator said the other day he ran his race he finished his course like paul he can go down in victory hallelujah it's not my legacy but the legacy is christ it's not what i can do or what i've done but all what he can do what he has done for me hallelujah i can only stand before you because of what he's doing i can only testify because of what he done he could have left me in the muck in the mirror clay he could have left me in my sin and shame but he decided hallelujah that i'll choose him and i'm glad that god done that how many glad that god done that but i said that's what it is you know we don't look at what we've done or what we've achieved come on but it's all because of what he allowed if god didn't allow it it wouldn't be done if god didn't save you you wouldn't be saved you know he could take your voice he can do all these things but god allowed it we're walking how by the grace of god but i says tonight remember me come on when you're down in those places sometimes you want to be remembered come on but i want to say tonight to as an encouraging word that god ain't forgot you i i was saying the other week that only the things you do for god that's what's going to last keep working for god keep living for god keep doing the best that you can do even though you might feel like i'm in a place that god has has you forgotten about me come on that's the only things that'll last what you do for god he'll he'll never forget what you do for him you know i thought about on that day he'll tell those he says when you when i was sick you visited me when i was hungry you fed me they said lord when did we do these do these things come on god ain't forgot it god remembered it he says when you've done it until who the least are my brethren he said you've done it also unto me how many thank the lord tonight [Music] praise god amen thank god the lord remembered they praise god job out of all of his trouble but god had his time they meant job trial and this test was going to be over and god looked down and he said it looked like he's not going to come out of it so much and so his wife couldn't take it no more but god said amen job said i know my redeemer live i you know you must have your own personal revelation amen you must have the witness and yourself you must know that god is capable amen and he can do it amen no matter how dark it looks praise god he said i won't forget you a mother can't forget her suckling child amen but you're graving in the palm of my hand and i won't forget amen lord remember me when you come in your kingdom and remember me i'm so glad that he remembered us amen he came down and got us out of our condition our situation where we were god remembered and he came by amen to see about us amen god is good amen we thank god for the word and we're going to so brother steve come up and just greet the church in his own way steve from ohio he's here with us for up into tuesday amen they just put me on the spot um yeah i'm from uh ohio llama ohio from believers christian fellowship and i'm just happy to be here with y'all and ever since i've come down here it's uh definitely been a leadership of the spirit i can see it in everything from plane trip down here and i was telling the brother i was with group five and then the second plane i was with group seven and and i was just seeing how the lord has been with it ever since uh i've been here so i'm just happy to be here appreciate what i've been uh what i just heard i got this um thing on my arm when i went to see noah's ark they got in kentucky and i've been wearing it ever since and it's called god remembered noah and i just thought it was funny that he just preached this message called god remember me and i've been wearing this this whole time so i know that that message definitely was for me and that encouraged me it's just so amazing it doesn't it keeps happening over and over so it's nothing new but it always touches you know when god is speaking directly to you when the message is personally to you not just something you're hearing and so i knew that that was uh definitely for me and i definitely appreciated it and it definitely blessed me and encouraged me and so um i'm just happy to be here and it's nice to meet you all god bless you i thought you're gonna tell a little bit of your testimony you got a little time tonight brother ernest was short oh okay i don't mind um so um everything kind of started with uh just god just dealing with me from time i was a young man when i uh was around 11 years old my dad gave me a book it was a blue book he had from the 80s and it was falling apart he just made this book sound so mysterious it really pricked my 11 year old mind and i'm like wow what is this book my dad talking about and um it was a real it was an old blue book it was the church age book and um so i was reading it and reading it and i remember like what in the world am i reading and um so i kind of left it alone but i never forgot about it and then um i remember as i started to get older and guys start dealing with me and you know i just started praying and reading my bible and thought it would be interesting to just start reading and reading and i can't really explain how it happened god just put a hunger and thirst in my heart to want to know more about him and read you know i grew up in a household where my dad definitely believed in god and always uh taught us how to pray and would tell us the scriptures and you know but um so as i got older and god started dealing with me um i'm just trying to remember everything uh so i started reading my bible and everything started praying and um i was as god started dealing with me more and more i'm reading the bible i'm getting into it i'm praying and i was like wasn't there a book my dad told me about when i was younger and um i was like yeah so i went downstairs to go grab it and i went and grabbed that book and it was the church age book and i started reading the church age book and reading my bible together and i just remember how important brother branham kept on saying in the church book how important revelation was he said revelation and you have to have the holy ghost you have to have the spirit and um he said it's the importance of revelation to the believer can never be overemphasized like he was saying you have to have your own individual revelation and uh and i'm just a young man in my early 20s and i was like just reading it and so instead of just reading my bible i would really learn to not just read i would really get down and pray and ask god will you reveal this to me you know i didn't really know anything about the word or anything like that didn't really have nobody to really teach me in that kind of way and and so i just got down on my knees in my room and started praying and asking god and just doing what his prophet said to do so i started praying for revelation and just sitting in my room um god just began to come to me right there in my bedroom in spirit and would come and talk to me and just reveal things to me it was one of the most it was some of the most precious moments i ever had my dad used to be like boy what are you doing in there it's so quiet he's like you wouldn't hear anything for hours hours and hours he said you wouldn't hear a sound and i was like wow i didn't realize it but it was because god was in there talking to me and so i'm just praying and reading my bible and reading the church age book and god just began to open the word up to me but more than just i was understanding things i was really seeing the effect it was having on my life as a young man things i began to lose sight of the world and i started to become more god focused and i was telling the pastor i had a tv in my room and i never heard and i know i hadn't heard one quote or anything where brother branham up to that point had ever even said anything about kicking a tv out and uh and i think god did that for a reason because i was studying listening messages and tapes and books and i was falling so much in love with this i completely forgot all about that and so god was something god was really showing me you know that it wasn't about um trying to to manufacture anything it's a love i had such a love for god that it really made me lose sight of the entertainments of the world and so he always brings me back to that you know wherever i feel a certain kind of way or he always always brings me back to that moment remember your first love remember these things and so i was just praying reading my bible reading the church age book and just studying and loving it so much and seeing the effect it had on my mind being a young man in his early 20s with early worldly 20 year old mentality just wanting to live in the world and make a lot of money and this and that and now my mind is god conscious i'm thinking about the word i'm thinking about my soul and um brother branham always said you gotta have the holy ghost you gotta have the holy ghost and so um i was like well i want this you know i did this for about a whole year prayer study praying or study and uh i want to back up just a little bit but um me and my dad didn't really have the best relationship at that time and uh the more i began to study and feed the word i wanted someone to have fellowship with and so the only person i knew i could really talk to you know about the message and things like that was my dad and me and my dad used to didn't really get along you know early i'm becoming a man and i was kind of still living at home so that relationship wasn't always so good but when god started dealing with me and i started talking to my dad uh their whole atmosphere in our house really began to change because we were we i started talking to him about the word and it was really reviving all the things that god had once was dealing with him and uh and just to see how that whole atmosphere could change in the home just from us really fellowshipping around the word and talking about different things and i was i'd be in my room for hours praying and i come downstairs and like dad this is what god was showing me and he'd be like wow you know and it just changed the whole atmosphere our relationship got so much stronger so i was really seeing the effect of the message it wasn't so much as i can see this or understand that i was really seeing the effect it was having on my life and the whole family live and it started affecting people around me without me even realizing it and um uh you gotta forgive me i'm a little nervous i gotta relax but um so then um i was like well i wanna get baptized you know in jesus christ's name brother branham always talked about that you gotta be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and so i was like uh what do i do where do i go i didn't even know what message churches was i never even heard of that term i didn't even know there was people that actually believed or followed what brother branham taught i just all i had was these books and tapes and i'm sitting in my room and um so um i was praying and praying about it and god said why don't you go on those on that website the voice of god website branham.org and ask those people so i like okay so i sent them my email and i said you know i'm a young man from ohio i've heard the message i believe it you know i want to get baptized but i have no idea where i'm supposed to go and so um they sent me a email back of churches in my area and i called a church in ohio and spoke with the pastor there it was where isaiah brooks used to be the pastor but when i was uh called it was a craig boor at the time and he did this i called him on a friday he's like brother i'm never in here on a friday he said i didn't even live anywhere near lima so i used to drive from a small town here you know and um so it was just god the whole way through and he said and even then i don't normally pick up the phone because it's normally as telemarketers and things so it was just god all the way through and um so we had a conversation and everything and i remember we was talking he said so brother you do you know anything about the message what do you do you know anything at all and you know this all i had did for a whole year by myself just felt feeding on the word feeding them everything brother branham taught so when he asked me that i just unloaded everything because you know i had someone i could fellowship with and talk to and you know i didn't know anything but it was just exciting time and it was just something for me as a young man and having someone else i could talk to and uh so to make long story short he i got uh i talked to him that friday he baptized me the next next day on a saturday and everything in the name of the lord jesus christ and so that's kind of how my testimony of how i really just came into the message and how god started dealing with me it was just supernatural you know when i look back on it at that time i didn't have any i had the friends that i hung out with i didn't see them anymore i didn't have a job i wasn't in school and i really seen how god used that opportunity to start dealing with me and so now i look back and i could see what god was doing and so i'm really grateful for it and so it was just i always tell people a lot of time it was really just people used to ask what happened to you did something really tragic happen or did this happen to you did that happen to you and i said no i was just god just put a hunger and thirst for the word in my heart and i had nothing to distract me at that time you know no uh friendship no relationships no anything and god just started dealing with me and um and so i just started feeding it and really god just began to change me and how the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind and so that's what really took place with me was my entire mind frame changed you know just to go from this young man that's been in the world feeding on the world have a worldly mentality to go from that to have this spiritual frame of mind of thinking about god and my soul and you know and wanting to be born again and wanting to feed and you know it was just such a good thing and it's still a good thing you know brother uh brother branham talked about that he said i remember he was talking to her brother he said when was your uh best time and the brother told him right now you know you should still have that same kind of love right for right now from start to finish you know it should never stop never die down so i'm going to be honest it wasn't always like i was you know i had a lot of troubles you know from uh just being up and down but god's really been holding on to me and really giving me a real revelation of who he is like he was saying with uh job and what he was going through you know but right in that worst time in his life he said i know my redeemer liveth and so you really see the power of revelation and what brother branham was talking about when he was saying the gates of hell wouldn't prevail when jesus said the gates of hell would be able to prevail against this rock the rock of revelation and that's how i know something really changed with me because i'm i'm still here and i'm still believing and god's just been renewing my strength and hunger and thirst for the word and um you know so that was really just my testimony prayer study then after that then you know what happened my dad he started wanting to come to church with me you know and so uh he and he got re-baptized again and then my sister came and she wanted to get baptized and then my other sister came and she wanted to get baptized and so i was like wow it was really nothing that i did it was just god but to see how god can deal with one person and then how you don't realize how your life and how god dealing with you can affect so many people around you and that's really what happened to me but it was nothing that i planned i didn't say when i read that book i'm gonna be a christian i'm gonna start serving god it was just honestly something i was doing just because i was bored but god had a plan and um and so now that's really just it just prayer study just feeding on the word and god changed me and got baptized and started going to church there and um yeah that's pretty much my testimony i would actually sing a song but he said don't sing i don't say but i'm happy i'm here and god bless you praise god caleb give us a song god is good amen praise y'all enjoyed the testimony enjoyed the word thank the lord god is good amen [Music] [Music] glory glory hallelujah since i lay my burning down glory glory [Music] hallelujah since i lay
