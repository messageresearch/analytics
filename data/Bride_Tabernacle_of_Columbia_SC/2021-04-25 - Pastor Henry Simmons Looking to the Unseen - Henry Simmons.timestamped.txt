[40:40] dishonesty
[40:41] not walking and crafting this not
[40:43] handling the word of god deceitfully but
[40:46] by manifestation
[40:47] of the truth commending ourselves to
[40:50] every man
[40:51] conscious in the sight of god
[40:54] but if our gospel will be heared it is
[40:57] hid to them that are lost
[40:59] in whom the god of this world has
[41:02] blinded the mind of them
[41:04] which believe not least the light of the
[41:08] glorious gospel of christ who is the
[41:11] image of god
[41:12] shall shine unto them but we preach
[41:16] not ourselves but christ jesus
[41:20] the lord ourselves your servant for
[41:22] jesus sake
[41:24] for god who commanded the light to shine
[41:27] out of darkness
[41:28] has shined in our hearts given the light
[41:32] of the knowledge of the glory of god in
[41:35] the face of jesus christ
[41:38] but we have this treasure in earthen
[41:41] vessels that the excellency of the power
[41:46] may be of god and not of us
[41:49] we are troubled on every side yet
[41:52] not distressed we are perplexed
[41:56] but not in despair persecuted
[42:00] but not forsaken cast down
[42:04] but not destroyed always burn
[42:08] about in the body the dying of our lord
[42:11] jesus
[42:13] that the life also jesus might be made
[42:16] manifest in our bodies
[42:19] for we which live are always delivered
[42:23] unto death for
[42:24] jesus sake that the life
[42:27] also of jesus might be made manifested
[42:31] in our modern flesh
[42:34] so then death worketh in us
[42:37] but life in you we have the same
[42:41] spirit of faith according as it is
[42:45] written
[42:45] i believe therefore have i spoken
[42:49] we also believe and therefore
[42:53] speak knowing that he
[42:56] which raised up the lord jesus
[42:59] shall raise up us
[43:03] also by jesus and shall present
[43:07] us with you for all things
[43:10] are for your sake that the abundance of
[43:14] grace might
[43:15] through the thanksgiving of many renown
[43:19] rebound to the glory of god
[43:23] for which cause we faint not
[43:26] but though our outward man perish
[43:30] yet the inward man is renewed
[43:34] day by day for our light afflictions
[43:38] which is but for a moment
[43:43] working for us are for exceeding
[43:46] an eternal weight of glory
[43:49] while we look not at the things which
[43:52] are seen
[43:54] but the things which are not seen
[43:57] for the things which are seen are
[44:00] temporal
[44:01] but the things which are not seen
[44:04] are eternal regardless the reason
[44:07] towards you may be seated
[44:12] this morning we want to talk to you
[44:15] about
[44:15] looking to the unseen
[44:20] looking to the unseen
[44:25] and god's servant says
[44:29] [Music]
[44:31] we do not look with our eyes
[44:36] uh we do he said we did not see with our
[44:38] eyes that's the way he said
[44:40] we do not see with our eyes
[44:44] we look with our eyes
[44:49] we see with our heart
[44:55] in other words as we go to saint john
[44:57] three
[44:58] and three we kind of understand what he
[45:00] was saying
[45:02] saint john 3 and 3.
[45:06] he said we look with our eyes
[45:13] and we see we
[45:17] we do not see with our eyes
[45:20] we look with our eyes and we see with
[45:24] our heart
[45:32] we look with our eyes and we see with
[45:34] our heart
[45:37] here in saint john 3 and 3
[45:41] nicodemus talked about to jesus
[45:44] rabbi we know that thou teaching to come
[45:46] from god because no man can do these
[45:48] miracles except
[45:49] god be with him and jesus asked and said
[45:52] unto him verily verily i sanded thee
[45:55] except for man be what
[45:58] the a man be what born again he cannot
[46:04] in other words that's why he said we
[46:07] cannot see
[46:10] we look with our eyes we cannot see with
[46:12] our eyes because we
[46:14] see with our heart in other words
[46:18] the sin that we're talking about is to
[46:21] understand
[46:24] and accept a man be born again he cannot
[46:28] see cannot understand the kingdom of god
[46:32] and that's why so many people
[46:37] are victims of looking but not sin
[46:42] because many they looked what they
[46:44] wasn't able to see
[46:47] and he told his disciples blessed are
[46:49] your eyes because you see
[46:53] for many thought they were sin but they
[46:56] were blind
[46:57] so he was saying in in second
[47:00] corinthians
[47:02] 4 he said if our gospel behead
[47:05] it is here to them that are lost
[47:09] amen because he said whom the god of
[47:13] this world
[47:14] has blinded the mind of them that what
[47:18] they believe not because they don't
[47:21] believe then the god of this world
[47:25] he blinds them
[47:29] and our eyes will deceive us
[47:32] because we look at what we see
[47:36] the problem with man
[47:40] is looking to what he see
[47:45] but i said look until the what
[47:48] unseen looking until the what
[47:54] unseen not to what
[47:57] we're deceived by what we see
[48:01] are you with me and that's where the
[48:04] devil works with your
[48:06] what you see with your eyes what you're
[48:08] looking at with your eyes
[48:10] the devil used your eyes to
[48:14] deceive you
[48:17] you remember he said all that is in the
[48:19] world is the lust
[48:21] of amen
[48:27] let's look at it again uh what was that
[48:30] first john 2
[48:35] see the devil gonna use your eyes
[48:39] as a gate the bible says
[48:42] upon this rock i will build my church
[48:45] and the gates of hell
[48:46] shall not prevail against it
[48:51] the light of the body is the eye
[48:55] amen and the devil amen
[48:58] a blind you
[49:01] with the your natural eyes will deceive
[49:05] you
[49:08] he says in the 15th verse or the second
[49:12] first john second chapter he said love
[49:15] not the world what
[49:19] these are the things that are in the
[49:20] world amen
[49:22] if any man love the what love the world
[49:25] the love of the father is what
[49:29] for all that is in the world is what
[49:32] the lust of the flesh and what
[49:37] see the eyes will desire what god
[49:41] the body might want what the eyes see
[49:46] but there is a compartment
[49:50] that's in the heart we call the soul
[49:57] amen and the soul the bible says the
[50:01] just shall
[50:02] live by what amen
[50:06] and uh ii corinthians 5
[50:09] it talks about we walk by faith
[50:13] not by sight
[50:17] so the soul must have the element of
[50:20] faith done in your heart
[50:24] the devil uses your head but god
[50:27] wants your heart the devil works with
[50:31] your intellect
[50:33] but god has that he wants to show the
[50:37] heart
[50:38] amen and it's very much
[50:41] that people are persuaded
[50:44] by what they see
[50:48] and they usually believe what they see
[50:51] but i say to you look until
[50:55] looking to the unseen the things that
[50:57] you cannot see
[50:59] because the things that you see are only
[51:02] temporal they're only temporary
[51:06] and and the devil was deceive you with
[51:09] the temporary things
[51:11] are you with me the things that only for
[51:15] a moment
[51:17] the things that only going to be here
[51:19] just for a season and a little while
[51:22] i think job styles it has a few days
[51:26] before he said a man that is born of a
[51:29] woman is over a few
[51:31] days amen and
[51:34] those few days are full of trouble
[51:38] oh you have been but jesus
[51:41] tried to take us to the unseen and he
[51:43] said
[51:44] let not your heart be what
[51:48] amen for in my father's house of many
[51:52] nations
[51:52] see jesus tried to elevate you out of
[51:55] the
[51:56] scene room into the unseen realm and
[51:59] give you
[51:59] something that you can trust in
[52:04] amen you cannot trust what you see
[52:08] every everything that you see amen
[52:13] it's temporal don't you ever forget it
[52:17] as a believer in christ
[52:20] don't base your hopes and your
[52:22] confidence on the things
[52:24] that you see but continue to look
[52:28] unto the unseen because he said faith is
[52:31] the substance of things what
[52:34] and it's the evidence of things
[52:37] so in your soul in your heart and in the
[52:41] inner man
[52:42] there's an outward man and there's an
[52:44] inward man
[52:46] he said though our aquaman what
[52:50] perish so the ark was seen what you see
[52:53] physically amen the outward man of
[52:57] perish amen
[52:58] we know that this world as we see with
[53:01] our natural odds
[53:02] it will perish amen
[53:06] that's why he said god so loved the
[53:08] world
[53:10] amen that he gave his only begotten son
[53:13] whosoever believed
[53:14] in him shall not
[53:17] amen so this this temporal world this
[53:21] amen but god wants you to amen the
[53:24] things that are not seen they are
[53:27] eternal are you a man
[53:31] so it's the unseen that we're trying to
[53:34] get you to understand
[53:36] but you cannot see or understand these
[53:39] things
[53:40] except you are born
[53:43] again see well if you're not
[53:47] born again you're not going to
[53:49] understand what we're talking about
[53:52] but if you have enough faith to believe
[53:54] this morning
[53:56] amen then you can't be born again
[54:01] because amen you must he said he that
[54:04] believeth on me
[54:05] as the scripture has said that out of
[54:08] his
[54:09] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[54:14] so to believe what god said
[54:17] is to cause a transformation
[54:23] a change with inside of the inner man
[54:27] the outside might resemble the same but
[54:30] the end of man
[54:33] god wants to get down into that inner
[54:36] man
[54:37] and faith in what god says
[54:40] will cause the inner man to be charged
[54:44] up and fired up
[54:46] it'll bring amen transformation in your
[54:50] life
[54:51] what you believe amen on the inside now
[54:55] this outside shell amen
[54:58] don't let it be amen your ultimate
[55:04] so as we said
[55:07] the lust of the flesh
[55:10] the lust of the eyes and what
[55:15] the pride of life this life now
[55:19] don't don't get caught up in this life
[55:22] here because he said
[55:24] which is not of the father and he said
[55:26] in the 17th verse
[55:27] the world as we know with what
[55:31] this world will pass away the bible said
[55:33] the elements going to melt
[55:34] with the what fervent heat it's going to
[55:37] burn up the world that we now know
[55:40] amen but peter took us takes us to the
[55:44] unseen
[55:44] he said but nevertheless he said now the
[55:47] world we
[55:48] know it's going to catch on fire it's
[55:49] going to burn up
[55:51] but peter said now i want you to look to
[55:53] the unseen nevertheless we are caught
[55:55] into his promise
[55:58] god has made you and i a promise we
[56:00] according to his promise
[56:01] look for a new heaven and a new earth
[56:04] weigh in dwell it it's not going to be
[56:08] righteousness right here amen
[56:12] but god has a new place amen
[56:15] and god amen let me go back here to the
[56:18] second corinthians because i i gotta
[56:21] move on because i want you to look into
[56:23] the unseen because god
[56:25] has gone to prepare a place for you
[56:28] that he said well i am that you may be
[56:31] also
[56:31] god wants to take you into the inner
[56:34] veil
[56:35] amen god wants to take you into a place
[56:38] amen
[56:39] amen that the natural man cannot see the
[56:41] things of god
[56:42] he does not know the things of god
[56:45] because he's only looking
[56:46] amen to the outside amen but god wants
[56:50] to go into the inner man
[56:52] into your soul and cause as amen that
[56:55] seed of god to be dermatized
[56:58] and quickened by his spirit and be
[57:00] brought to life
[57:01] and have the preeminence in your life
[57:05] hallelujah so here we are
[57:09] he said here in um uh
[57:13] the the latter verse of that chapter it
[57:16] says
[57:16] while we look not on the things which
[57:18] are what
[57:20] sing eighteenth verse why we look not on
[57:23] the things of the scene
[57:24] but the things which are not what see
[57:28] okay not i said looking until the what
[57:32] looking unto the unseen we're not
[57:34] looking at the things we're looking at
[57:36] the things that are not seen
[57:39] oh you look man okay
[57:42] it says for the things which are seen
[57:45] are temporal but the things which are
[57:47] not seen
[57:47] eternal now i want to go on to the fifth
[57:50] chapter
[57:51] and here and number one it says we know
[57:54] that if
[57:55] our earthly house of this tabernacle
[57:58] were
[57:59] dissolved amen
[58:03] now we know that but the world don't
[58:06] know that
[58:08] because they'll only look into what they
[58:10] see
[58:13] amen but we know that of our earthly
[58:15] house or this tabernacle
[58:18] you know what what got me as i was
[58:20] praying this morning
[58:23] it was the ability that people don't
[58:26] trust god
[58:28] they trust what they see but they don't
[58:30] trust they don't look to the unseen
[58:33] amen but to trust god is to believe what
[58:36] he says
[58:38] ain't meant to have enough confidence
[58:40] that god would do what he said
[58:45] i'm gonna skip over and almost go to the
[58:47] end of what i was
[58:49] had prepared and go to hold it down and
[58:52] conventions there and then let me go to
[58:54] first john 5. because
[59:01] a lack of confidence is is
[59:05] is what traps man first john fight
[59:08] because we don't have a confidence in
[59:10] god you never ask god
[59:12] you know when you lose confidence in a
[59:15] person
[59:16] you know many people amen they lose
[59:18] confidence in ministry they lose
[59:20] confidence and
[59:21] husband lose confidence in wife they
[59:23] lose confidence in children
[59:25] once you lose confidence in them you
[59:27] don't trust them no more
[59:30] you know it doesn't matter how well or
[59:33] how much if a person you know if i
[59:36] if i'm passionate a person lose
[59:38] confidence in me you know i can't help
[59:40] them
[59:42] it's no way for me to help a person if
[59:45] they don't have confidence in them
[59:47] in you and matter of fact if they go to
[59:49] you to ask you something they ain't got
[59:51] confidence in you
[59:52] i mean i don't care how well you counsel
[59:54] them i don't care how well you talk to
[59:56] them
[59:58] if what you tell them they don't have
[1:00:01] confidence in you
[1:00:02] it don't mean nothing either way you
[1:00:03] just waste a whole lot of time
[1:00:07] are you with me because if a person
[1:00:09] don't have confidence in you they just
[1:00:11] going through the motion
[1:00:14] but they must have confidence in you in
[1:00:17] order to trust you
[1:00:20] are you with me because if they don't
[1:00:22] have
[1:00:23] if you don't have confidence in god who
[1:00:26] he is and what he can do for you
[1:00:28] then you don't actually go to god and
[1:00:30] ask him for anything
[1:00:34] but if you know that he is god and he
[1:00:36] can help you
[1:00:40] are you with me i said the reason why
[1:00:43] we look to the scene but we don't look
[1:00:46] to the unseen
[1:00:48] you know sometimes god can look beyond
[1:00:51] david's fault and he can seek god
[1:00:54] david's heart and and sometimes folk
[1:00:57] would look at david and amen uh
[1:01:00] adulterers and what he did to the best
[1:01:03] even how he got
[1:01:04] your eyes killed and how he did this but
[1:01:06] god
[1:01:07] looked beyond his faults and he saw his
[1:01:10] heart
[1:01:10] and god was able to amen come as son of
[1:01:14] david amen
[1:01:15] to be identified with david as
[1:01:18] oh lord can you see that god gonna be
[1:01:23] identified
[1:01:24] as son of david
[1:01:27] amen i won't you be ashamed to
[1:01:30] be identified with oh with god amen
[1:01:34] wretched mercy it just shows you how
[1:01:37] much he loves us how much he cares about
[1:01:40] us
[1:01:41] how god sees amen the man sees the
[1:01:44] outward appearance but god sees the word
[1:01:48] god sees the heart amen
[1:01:51] it doesn't matter how you come up to
[1:01:54] your
[1:01:55] email uh revelation or understanding
[1:01:58] but god sees your heart
[1:02:02] amen you might make many uh mistakes and
[1:02:05] you might
[1:02:06] fall many times but god knows your heart
[1:02:11] god knows you amen
[1:02:14] that sometimes amen you got to say i'm a
[1:02:17] failure
[1:02:17] amen and i know i'm a failure but god
[1:02:20] you know my heart
[1:02:23] holly do you if something down in the
[1:02:25] inside won't let me go
[1:02:28] amen the devil said you ready well give
[1:02:30] up forget it

[1:03:35] them all
[1:03:37] are you praise god the doctors might
[1:03:40] have said
[1:03:41] such a bevel is all over but god said

[1:15:44] for of our earthly house this is the
[1:15:47] temporary house
[1:15:49] i'm going the musicians can come i told
[1:15:51] you i'll be short today they said i went
[1:15:53] along
[1:15:53] friday so i'm sure today
[1:15:58] but by the grace of god if our earthly
[1:16:01] house
[1:16:02] this tabernacle he talks about it
[1:16:06] second corinthians excuse me i said
[1:16:08] first then
[1:16:09] ii corinthians 5. i'm back there okay
[1:16:13] it says for we know that if our earthly
[1:16:16] house of this tabernacle were dissolved
[1:16:18] we have a building of god a house not
[1:16:21] made with hand
[1:16:23] eternal in the heavens now it's it's
[1:16:26] it's one thing
[1:16:27] the devil satan
[1:16:30] satan as the prophet of god
[1:16:33] said that little compartment there's a
[1:16:35] wall constantly going on
[1:16:38] god put something in you amen
[1:16:41] that he wants to lead you to control
[1:16:44] tower

[1:16:50] down in the soul faith amen god put that
[1:16:55] that you can be led by faith
[1:16:59] but man wants to be led by what sight
[1:17:04] by what he see
[1:17:07] god is always always trying to lead you
[1:17:11] by his spirit that you can walk by faith
[1:17:15] and not
[1:17:16] by sight that you can have confidence in
[1:17:19] his word
[1:17:20] amen and follow jesus
[1:17:24] but what happens man always listen to
[1:17:27] what he see
[1:17:28] and follow what he see
[1:17:32] instead of listening to thy inner man
[1:17:35] see the outward man battles the inward
[1:17:38] man
[1:17:41] the inward voice just trying to lead you
[1:17:44] in the path of righteousness for his
[1:17:46] name
[1:17:46] sake the bible said they that are led by
[1:17:50] the spirit of god they are the what
[1:17:53] they are the sons of god god is trying
[1:17:55] to lead you one way
[1:17:56] and your eyes are trying to
[1:17:59] the satan is trying to lead you up
[1:18:02] another way he's trying to lead you

[1:18:15] there's a war going on in my memories
[1:18:17] when i decide to do good he said what
[1:18:20] evil is present with me so i'm in a i'm
[1:18:22] in a conflict
[1:18:23] i'm in a battle god is trying to lead me
[1:18:26] but the devil
[1:18:27] looked like he's sleeping trying to lead
[1:18:29] me too who i'm gonna listen to
[1:18:33] my heart of my head
[1:18:37] are you with me am i going to be led by
[1:18:40] the spirit
[1:18:41] i'm going to be led by my flesh and the
[1:18:44] lust of this world
[1:18:46] am i going to be like eve
[1:18:51] praise god i'm going to be like jesus
[1:18:56] eve was led by her eyes what she saw
[1:18:58] with her eyes
[1:19:00] and satan amen use your eyes against you
[1:19:05] against your very soul and causes
[1:19:09] destruction to your soul
[1:19:12] amen so we said look until the what
[1:19:16] look unto the unseen amen
[1:19:19] praise god so you see amen as that
[1:19:22] control tower down deep
[1:19:25] in the inner man that soul is saying

[1:19:28] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[1:19:30] i
[1:19:32] amen i i want to follow god i want to i

[1:19:48] sight god i want i want
[1:19:51] i want your will for my life
[1:19:54] god i want i i want to be led by you god
[1:19:59] oh the devil is upset he's mad he's
[1:20:02] angry because he know that you're

[1:20:42] and been leading you no longer shall he
[1:20:45] lead you
