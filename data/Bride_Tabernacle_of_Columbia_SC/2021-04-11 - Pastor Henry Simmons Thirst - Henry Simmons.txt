amen don't have no bitterness in him are you with me psalms 42 it says here as the heart painted after the water broke so painted my soul after the o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my meat day and night while they continue saying to me where is thy god when i remember these things i pulled out my soul in me for i had done with the multitude and i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise and the multitude that kept holy day thou art why are thou cast down o my soul while thou disquiet within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his candidates oh my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of joy and of hermione hermannite and from the hill of mr deep call it unto deep at the noise that thy water sprout all thy waves all thy waves thou billows are gone over me yet the lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and in the night his songs shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life god bless you in this word you may be seated we want to talk this morning for a few moments concerning thirst first the book of saint matthew 5 he says and seeing the multitude he went up into the mountain and when he had set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed unto me for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do what hunger and what thirsts thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled thirsts blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled while i was in prayer yesterday i just and i was just praying because we're living in an hour and a day that and people come to church you meet people every day christian so-called and we wonder sometimes who wants god is there any that thirsts after god they need that seek in the lord and i was talking to brother randy a little bit after prayer and he says there are people and he didn't know i was praying and it was it was going through me he said he said there are people out there that's hungry and thirsts after god just need somebody to tell them need somebody to witness to him there are people that's really hungry and thirsty and i thought you know because i thought about going another way this morning and i said people that are really hungry and thirsty and i saw that they're admitted in it they're thirsting and they don't understand what they're thirsting for so here in um isaiah 55 [Music] isaiah 55 it says because the many many people are thirsting but they're trying to satisfy their thirst with different things and to the christian he said deep call it to deep how deep is your experience are you just satisfied is there a deep calling to deep in your life if god is telling you let's go deeper or you come to a place of complacency would you just satisfy where you are are you desiring a deeper walk with god and if if there's a desire for a deeper war you know many times people experience and and their experiences they don't know what level they are on they don't know or you know it's something about uh being in the water and it's just waste just knee-deep and it's something about being in the water and it's wasting and then it's something that that you all the way in where you it's all the way over your head how deep is your experience see it's sometimes the cup is half filled and sometimes the cup is three-quarter but david said my cup my cup runneth over surely goodness and merchants shall follow me all the days of my life it's something about when your cup is running over i believe that's the one that has a overflow a overflow of the joy of the lord and that's the one that's at peace with god you know we cannot be at peace with god until we experience that peace within and we must not not let anything anything in our lives disturb the joy and the peace that god has given us but sometimes it takes a deeper walk with god to get to the point my soul thirsts whether you've come to a place the soul thirsted for the living god and the the thirst have been quenched you've gotten to that place where you have that experience or you have that experience with god and your thirst you're not thirsty anymore you become satisfied with that living god amen you received the water of life and we find that our desires the thirst having to do well with uh the desires what are we desiring what do we want the prophet of god talks about the flesh has its desires it desires fleshly and earthly things and you try to satisfy that thirst he says is it a female to desire to be pretty that is a uh it's normal for uh a a female to want to be purty that's an arm of thirst but not the beauty of the world but she'll she's the dawn itself of mine it's a period to change faces and sobriety according to timothy 2 but there is a thirst with inside each and every one of us my soul he says my soul thirsted for the living god so he was not just talking about the the the body needs water and and we we thirst because it's an alarm goes off it's abuzz goes off when we need water and sometimes even in america you might think it's strange that people have dehydration they're just out there and they're working and they they don't know what happened to them they just fall out and they go to the hospital and they find it out that the alarm went off you needed to drink some more water you needed fluid and if you're not careful you might have a sun stroke or whatever so there's a thirst for water it's a buzzer alarm that goes off when that torch is there and that little buzzer that goes off you're gonna have to you you have to tend to it and you have to supply that water for that body if you do not supply the water amen you will perish you'll die many times you go to a hospital and they have to give folks iv fluid and so forth because why there's something inside of them because they are a lack of the water in their body causing them to be sick and if they don't get that fluid in them they'll die and that alarm went off the alarm goes off in cygnus get to the water you need water if you want to live you better get some water okay so by the grace of god here in isaiah 55 he said ho everyone that what see come ye to the water are you with me if you're thirsty he said come to the water you know there's an invitation there there's an invitation from from god to you to come to the water nothing is going to replace that water come to the water amen and he that has no what no money come ye and buy and eat yea come and buy wine and milk without money and without what price wherefore do you spend money for that which some people waste their whole paycheck spent all their money [Music] with that which is not bread oh i'm getting drunk i'm living it up i'm having a ball why spend your money for that this is not bread people do those things and and that's all they know because why because the flesh desire the things of the earth it is out of pleasure of the world and that flesh is going to say satisfy me and it looks just if you don't satisfy that flesh that flesh is gonna act up and that devil gonna come and he's gonna make you miserable until you give that flesh to satisfaction that is crying out for are you with me that's why when young people reach a certain age they look for companionship because that flesh they aim at things in that body began to you know act up and sometimes before they get big enough to look for companionship they're slipping and mama come in the room and they they know how to do that computer jump put it up they know how to bypass and do all kind of tricks on that computer why because they they they fly some folk grow up before their time and every parent think i got a good my child don't do that i got a good child hey hey come on somebody you better watch yourself you better be on guard amen because that flesh is gonna amen want to be satisfied and it'll drive you in places amen that you might not want to go and when you get there you might not know how to get out of it you because you're trying to please it you can never please your flesh your flesh should never be satisfied i don't care what you give it it'll never be satisfied it always something next most folks you know a slip and do this and slip and do that next thing you know they're way out there somewhere and can't get back on the devil will take you further than you want to go are you with me but you can say i ain't going but so far amen you're not in control of where you go you know as many people say i ain't going but so far i never thought i'd be way out here amen well i can't swim back to the shore some folks they never thought that they'd be in a place where they can't see the land no more amen they just thought they just get on the shadow in the ocean next thing you know they're way out there somewhere can't even see the way back home amen our homeland is the word and we need to find amen praise god let me let me just go ahead oh he says in the second verse again wherefore do you spend money for that which is not what prayer we know the word of god is the bread of life and uh and you can you know the kind of wine that god is offering is he said be not drunk with wine but rather be filled with the spirit and peter said these men are not drunk as you suppose seen it but the third hour of the day amen these men are full of the new wine and that new wine is the baptism of the holy ghost now what's stopping and what's hindering you from what your soul thirsts for amen and some people don't want it i and i i realized that but i said some people are so bound up and so messed up in their life they design god they really want god but there are others that are supposed to have him and no warning there are others that have their grand opportunity but there's folks out there bound they've been raised in homes and in families that if they could have an opportunity just an opportunity to hear the things you hear just an opportunity amen to experience amen the gods the living god amen some people never get a chance to even hear what you hear and we hear it and we turn it down okay he says and your labor for that which what satisfies what amen label your work you label for that which satisfied not why because you still want more in it if it's satisfied then you don't need no more amen he said the water that i'll give you woman if you come and drink some of this water amen you're never are you looking y'all remember the woman at the well jesus said give me a drink she said how come you're being a jew and jesus said if you ask me for a drink i'll give you water amen that you will never thirst again i believe jesus still giving water amen water that you won't have to thirst no more you'll never thirst again hallelujah never thirst again oh give me some of that water hallelujah i want that water that i never have to touch anymore hallelujah but there must be a desire somebody must want the water amen somebody must desire he said uh he that hungered and what thirst after righteousness shall amen somebody don't want to do the right thing somebody don't want amen live a righteous life but if there are many that's trapped in the prisons and in the jailhouses and in the graveyard and in the hospital this morning they had an opportunity if they heard the word they would accept it this water oh how many times i've ministered in the prison and i've seen young men that they meant that their life is gone and vanished away because they're facing amen uh life sentences where they never get out amen they're just young boys and amen and i managed to turn them and they they come and tell me the story amen wrong place at the wrong time and amen i just did this and look at my life i was in medical school i was just and i was that just made a bad decision one day there's the heart painted out to the water bro one young man he was telling me his story he tried to walk the bank with the water going there's so many stories one young man said if you can help me get out of this i go back to med school i want to go back to med school but i got addicted to playing the normals and i i went farther and farther just trying to win and i got addicted to it i got kicked out of med school and everything i lost everything i had my opportunities but if i can just turn back the hands of time if i can just turn around i won't go this way no more i'll never go out and buy me a ticket i won't do it anymore oh sometimes we miss our opportunity amen what we have we don't appreciate it amen we're not thankful and grateful to god for sparing our lives and not getting us amen not that we've not made our mistakes it's not that we have not done wrong but god has been merciful to you and i amen we had been so good but thank god that one day the word got to my heart and i wanted to do right i always had that desire to do right and i believe if you desire to do right

praise god deep praise god i don't know i was looking back on those buses football and the fellows were singing those songs they must have been church they used to be beaten on the bus deep deep and they were saying we should not be moved and they were saying about the football team just like a tree and then i said they were singing gospel and i didn't realize that and i i just felt that deep deep down in my soul amen they was getting in the spirit just to play football and and sometimes we're so influenced by those spirits don't even know that they sang in the gospel and all under the

amen praise god that's a heavenly desire thirst amen praise god and the holy ghost want to quench the thirst of the heavenly desire they met the body the spirit got a desire for god in his soul amen we need the baptism of the holy ghost we need the holy ghost water liquids to thrust the soul amen god wants to come into you god wants to fill you with this spirit the bible says how shall we neglect and we shall and we don't receive this great salvation god wants you to receive it what you're hearing this morning he don't want you to walk out of here and don't receive the one that made you come

until god come in god is the only one that can quench that thirsty soul brothers and sisters if you want that thirst to be quenched i beseech you by the mercy of god that you consider jesus consider what he done what he died for to free you from the wrath to come to give you an opportunity to receive his love and his joy and his peace he gives you that opportunity this morning he gives you the opportunity to the saints of god that they meant that sometimes you struggle going through battles they may going through problems and situations but god says that the deep call it to the deep then there's a deep to respond god is here this morning to even give you that satisfying potion to take away your doubts and your fears to give you that peace that compasses all knowledge and understanding why because once you get anchored aching in god anchored in the word the water of life flows freely hallelujah i believe that woman was so fired up and stirred up she went running through the city

you should be witnesses of me praise god tanks don't never lose the fire don't never stop telling folklore jesus shame to the atmos jesus saying jesus same man brother sister i want to testify that

they just can't because they're past that separation line the alarm has stopped going off there's no more call to god for them they don't even thirst for god no more they don't even want him to turn him down for the last time the minute that failed to come i guess it kind of just kind of goes along with what you were just saying because this morning as i was cooking get something ready and um i'm sorry the last sunday that we saw on betty before she went in the hospital toyah was like you know guys i got some songs i want us to you know just sing around you know the house whatever so we started listening to the songs or whatever different songs she was saying uncle frank went in the kitchen he came out i think he had two little canes but he kind of like put them to the side i said oh
