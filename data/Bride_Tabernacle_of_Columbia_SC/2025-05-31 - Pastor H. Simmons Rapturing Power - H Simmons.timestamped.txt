[1:09:06] word that we heard tonight, Lord. God,
[1:09:09] truly, Lord, it was something real,
[1:09:12] Lord, that spoke to our hearts. Lord,
[1:09:15] God, we know that Lord, as the seed went
[1:09:18] out, God, that the devil might try to
[1:09:20] take it. But oh God, I pray Lord by the
[1:09:23] Holy Ghost that it fell on good ground
[1:09:25] tonight, Lord, that we might be able to
[1:09:28] take that which we heard and ponder on
[1:09:30] it in our hearts. Oh God, we might be
[1:09:32] able to see the manifestation of your
[1:09:34] spirit. Bless your children, God.
[1:09:36] Continue, Lord, blessing the ministry,
[1:09:38] Lord, the pastor, God. Continue
[1:09:40] strengthening and guiding them. Lord,
[1:09:42] bless your children, God. here those
[1:09:44] that have made it out tonight, those
[1:09:46] that are listening in. God, I pray that
[1:09:48] you forever be with them, strengthen
[1:09:50] Lord in a mighty way. God, we ask these
[1:09:53] things in many blessings. In the name of
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
