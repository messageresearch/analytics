for and um in the midst of this pandemic I I was thinking about what would stop you and I from praising God what would stop you limit your worship and I noticed that the devil is against true worship and the devil amen he wants to divide a scheme whereby he would interfere and causes your worship to be limited you know sometimes when people cannot come in these large Gatherings then their worship cease people are are limited because they are used to having uh Worship in a certain way but the Bible tells us when two or three are gathered in my name he said D I'm in the midst we are finding that people are finding a way to praise God in spite [Music] of people are having Church in their homes with their families and they're worshiping God and a lot of those folks are expressing that they actually putting their worship on the internet and uh and and they're encouraging not only their families or those loved ones and Facebook and Instagram and all of that they're they're worshiping God some don't sound too good but nevertheless they might sound good to themselves like I sound good to myself when I'm singing I was singing the uh a song he's so faithful and I you know I I said it's probably a song that's somebody sang and I was going on faithful he's so faithful amen and I said faithful and I can hear him say he's so faithful and then I said faithful and I can hear him said he's so faithful amen and I said God is so faithful he's faithful to me amen amen and I was just having a good time just on he's faithful amen and I believe that he's faithful I believe we ought to enjoy the faithfulness of the Lord that God is so faithful Amen in spite of all the pandemic and everything people are going through God is faithful he's faithful to me amen and he's faithful to you God is so faithful faith [Music] [Music] re [Music] n [Music] [Music] bir [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] h [Music] the [Music] amen God is good amen he's worthy amen so glad he's worthy the book of St John this morning we thank God for here being so worried we appreciate again every one of you press your way out and those that are listening in we thank God because he's worthy appreciate

I I I looked at what's going on and in the nation and in the country and the turmoil and the chaos that is in and I said people are losing trust in the government and they are losing trust in the political system but brother and sister we can trust God St John 14 I mean 4 and 14 it says but who whosoever drth of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I should give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into Everlasting Light the woman said and to him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come here to draw Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband for thou H has had five husbands and he whom thou now has is not thy husband in that sayest thou truly the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou are a prophet our fathers Worship in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father for ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth may God bless the read word you may be seated let's just bow again father we thank you again this morning for true worship Lord Lord we know

to complete Friday night but as I began to being being proud I said I can't all I can think about is I think the devil is start trying to limit our praises and trying to stop the sints of God from really praising God and worshiping God I believe Psalm is giv in to amen the conon crafts whereby amen the devil has slipped in to the homes and to the families and people amen yes they're tuning in Amen to the services and all but somehow amen the joy of being together the devil has stolen that away from the hearts of the people I'm not saying you have to be here but I'm talking about I want you to be in worship it don't matter where you are amen I want you to give God thanks and give God praise no matter where you are if you're at home are you on the job I want you to begin to praise God more than you ever praised the Lord before because the devil is trying to take away your worship are you with me there's all there's been a war in heaven that took place in heaven when the uh Lucifer was upset because he wanted Amen to be worshiped he wanted God's Place amen and the devil amen that because he had all these musical instruments that he was made up of that he wanted to amen thought that he should be the one amen that everybody was supposed to be bowed and down and worshiping are you with me sometimes because of the beauty amen people amen get stuck up in how nice the church look how nice the building is how nice the choir sing amen they think amen and the people lose focus and lose their attention and they think amen how intelligent the preacher he is and how amen but this thing comes down to your individual Revelation amen true worship amen has had to be revealed to you as an individual as it was in the days amen of Cain and AA amen Cain amen bought of the fruit of the ground he thought that he had a true revelation of what God wanted and maybe he didn't care amen he was interested in what wanted to give God Amen and some folks amen have come to the point amen that they in their spirit and in their mind amen says well amen this is what I'm going to give you God but by Revelation AA amen knew what God was requiring and what God wanted amen by Revelation you must uh understand what God is requiring and what God wants uh for you amen as an individual amen forget about everybody else but you as an individual you can't think about what amen God re requiring a mama a daddy or husband or wife you must know what God is requiring of you as an individual and Lord what you requiring of me that's what I want to give you amen as God is requiring every Church AG in Ephesus amen he had somewhat against them because they had left their first love and those that overcame in that age God had a reward Amen to the Overcomer amen and God Amen saw amen that the church was aiming at God but it got relaxed amen and so God knew the status in the state amen and he knew what it would take for them to overcome in that age and God would give them amen a revelation for the age that they will living in amen that they could overcome the schemes and the Ws of the devil brother and sister Amen in every age we've been under attack of the enemy praise God in th they had the spirit of Jezebel they suffered that woman Jezebel to teach amen and seduce God's people amen praise God they knew that this was the age of a dominating female and that female was just not a woman but it was the church amen that have taken amen dominion over the people amen the people had fell in love with the church and the church was taking preeminence over the people Amen in Jezebel as she had crept in Israel in the days of Ahab amen and she had caused the children of Israel to worship baale so Jezebel had crept into the church in the thar Church age and caused the dark ages of history that come into be amen but God knew that the amen the ref would take place later amen and he saw amen that the true worshipers amen would come out amen from what looked like it was dead and there was no hope amen but there was a root amen praise God down in the ground that was going to spring up the blade uh amen the cor of weak going to fall in the ground and die but it's going to come up again and I thank God that the church amen began to experience an Resurrection Amen in the s's age it means Escape ones amen praise God it's time to escape out of her my people God in every age had a revelation of what he was required and what he wanted in that age brother and sister no no doubt God has given us a revelation for what he wants amen because they let amen God ordained predestinated seed know what God wants to do with the word praise God now I want to go back and simplify it that was just something to just praise God a appetize before we get the meal Daniel 3 Daniel 3 I'm brother uh you know I felt like running around the church and uh excited because of true worship and I've been out here just walking and praising and praising and praying and praying and praying sometime you're praying uh breaking into praise amen I think on Friday night I I I told Rachel or some of I told Caleb hold a minute let me hold you cuz I couldn't hardly walk and I I was holding on them trying to get out of here and then when I got ready to go up the steps at home I said Rachel come back here let me hold you while I can make it up the steps and then this morning when I got ready to leave out the house my wife came with the cane she said you want it I said no I don't want it I'm going on in Jesus name you know the devil is defeated isn't that right amen he wants to break your down he want to tear you down he want to do all he can do to keep you you know I like to I like to praise God you know what I'm saying and sometime I like to run you know just run around and praise the Lord so the devil know I I you know I like to kneel down you know a lot of times everybody else got a pillow and all of that and I need down on the cement floor because I remember where I came from the cement floor on my knees and uh you know I said you know the devil know I like to kneel down on that cement floor and then he want to mess up my knees cuz I like to kneel down on that cement floor because I remember back in the day amen that we had a nice hard cement flow and amen nobody thought about a pillar you know what I'm saying there KNE down on the cement PL for and you're prayed amen now amen we we can't understand that I said Lord don't let me get too comfortable are you with me so a lot of times I didn't want to get too comfortable you know you know how we get comfortable you know I was one of the first churches in in in in probably 1980 or something like that 70 uh 79 or something like that I had seats with um pads on it and I think I was one of the only churches in the city that had Church in the little town of Mullin with uh seats with pads on them and people come to look at the seats you know and I and I said well you know sometime we can get a little comfortable isn't that right and a little relaxed it's all right now you know it's uh it's 40 something years later and we can get a little comfortable isn't that right but let us don't get too comfortable that we can't look back and see where God bought us from he bought us from a long way and we can't forget it when I get down on my knees and it's uncomfortable I said Thank You Lord that I can get down on my knees amen amen when I find myself on yesterday just sitting on the uh side of the pull pit instead of getting down on my knees uh I thought about you know it's a blessing to get on your knees ain't that right praise God you can be in so much pain in so much misery till you can't even kneel down you know amen something can grip you till you can't even clap your hand something can grip you where you can't even say Amen are you with me things can happen in life that you desire to say amen and thank you Jesus are you with me but I I want you to realize why you have an opportunity to worship and to praise the Lord take your opportunity don't let nothing stop you are you with me because the devil is doing everything he can do to stop you from worshiping here in uh Daniel I know you're familiar with it Daniel 3 amen and 8 y'all familiar with Nebuchadnezzar he he he he he don't want uh they devise a scheme whereby the the children of Israel amen were to bow or burn come on somebody bow a burned are you with me the devil amen are set up and he divise schemes that you bow or you burn and that's not only the natural fire but spiritual fire There Are Spiritual things that are happening today amen that the devil amen wants to take you away from true worship and the devil amen say you bow or you burn but you got to let the devil know amen I burn before I bow are you with me you're not going to amen uh cause any kind of fear and you're not going to make me afraid because I I rather burn before I bow are you with me here in eight wherefore at the time at a certain time at at the time certain calans came near and accused the Jews are you with me the devil just don't like you because you are the Bride of Jesus Christ because you're a Christian the devil amen don't like that praise God the devil want you to be like all the other so-called Christians are you with me but you're not just like the rest of them you think that the only shot right mot can B the go was just the only three that was in Babylon are you with me but those three were the one that they were interested in amen that we'll burn you if you don't bow there are many that does they don't mind Bing are you with me there are many that have given up and given in but these three amen we willing to let them know our burn before I bow look around in the church today there are many that are giving in amen their worship doesn't mean too much praise God they haven't taken a full stand for good God they compromising amen their worship praise God don't let the devil sneak in and amen that rock and roll music and

amen all kinds of music amen but there must be a music that is Holy amen that is Godly that God can say I'm well pleased amen God can tunee in to your music God can tune in to your worship and God can be the object of your worship amen God Amen is well pleased because I'm not doing it to be seen the man I'm not doing it to impress anybody but I'm caught up in the love of God and I love him and I amen might not sound amen as eloquent as others uh but I know that my God uh I want to worship Him in spirit and in truth hallelujah amen I want God to be amen that he accepts My Worship I want him to

we're depending on Jesus every steep of away praise God so let's not get caught up let's not be confused about what's going on let's keep our eyes on the prize keep on pressing on he says shaken in mind and Trouble by Spirit not by word either by letter as for us as that day of Christ is at hand I believe I was reminiscing going back in my mind what kind of church in anticipation of the coming of the Lord back there 2,000 years I believe the church was under great expectation that the Lord was soon to come and they were even saying for the coming of the Lord draw nigh I believe that they were anticipating and and you know I believe that they waited in their day under great anticipation of the Rapture and the changing of the body the different things that uh Paul was preaching back there and I believe amen if we were to look back in those days uh amen those people were amen anticipating the coming of the Lord and they were on fire for God Amen we have experienc in our last day amen in the 60s where the great Revival took place God sent a prophet to the age amen One locking to Moses and One locking to Elijah and uh it was to stir amen signs and wonders and amen and Gifts amen of the Holy Ghost God had moved in such a supernatural way and yet uh 50 some odd years later amen look like the church has been swep in US gone to sleep are you with me and they're saying we waited long enough we waited long enough where is the promise of his coming oh yes so the people will look at and with disdain the Bible today so many have lost confidence in the Bible today yet they go to church and yet they sing and so they make up their own standard that they going to live by each church and made their own standard and they're worship God according to their own persuasion no more does the bible hold the standard the absolute in the church is the church amen has become their own absolute are you with me but brother and sister the word of God Is Right praise God and somebody said I wait no matter how long it takes I know he coming back I know God going to do what he said Hallelujah are you with me brother hallelujah thank you Jesus I can see amen the seed of the woman going to bruise the head of the serpent amen I can see amen when amen God promised amen that a virgin should concede and I can see him waiting waiting waiting hundreds of years passed by in the scripture St hadn't been fulfilled I can see him saying it ain't going to happen and when it happened I could see those Nays sales saying I don't believe it anyhow because it took too long praise God it might have took a long time for a woman to become the vice president or maybe the president it might have took too long for us to see the things amen which was talking about in 193 3 amen but
