you bless us now lord as we look to you for all things in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god is good amen we want to look at matthew 27 by god's grace still something was ministering on the other day and i just pray that it'd be a blessing matthew 27 we got it saved man we'll begin at the 27th verse and it reads then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole man of soldiers and they stripped him and they put on him a scarlet robe you may be seated continue reading and when they had plated a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hell king of the jews and they spit on him spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off him from off off from him and put his own raymond on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of siren simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross and when they were coming to a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had test tasted thereof he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vested they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus king of the jews then were there are two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and one on the left on and another on the left and they passed and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou has thou that destroys the temple and builds it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him and scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross he will and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth may god had a blessed reading of his word and just we'll just stop right there tonight but by the grace of god tonight i want to minister and and just for a moment just talk about calvary and what calvary meant what it wrought in our lives you know it's it's a lot of we say it's a lot of great days throughout all world history we can go over a lot of them that things that took place throughout all history but there never was a greater day that we can look to or look back to or to say that ever took place in history like that day on calvary though the majority of the world didn't know what was taking place god was doing something uh great in the earth from where man had fallen and needed a savior needed to be redeemed because of disobedience and him doing what god asked him not to do separated him from god separated him from uh the tree of life where he could eat and live forever and you know sin when sin came about you know it did something like we said to separate us and the only way that we could be united back to god would be by the shedding of blood innocent blood and we know how we had shadows and types of bulls and goats but they could only cover your sin from year to year you know i was saying the other day how you know when when you sin or every year once a year the people would have to bring a lamb or or a dove if you were in a poor class and whatever they bring it up and you know before the priest would slay it they would you would put your hands on it or however they would do it and they would let you know that this innocent subject is dying because of the sins that you committed you were the one that was supposed to be uh paying this penalty but you know god is accepting uh innocent subject to take your place but it could only do it from year to year but it was going to come a time where it would no longer you would have to do it from year to year but god was going to do something great even in himself where he come and give his life for mankind to unite us back with him so as we look at what god done for us it's so many benefits and things that we benefited from calvary that yet we we lack sometimes to to receive the benefits that god has given uh us here at calvary you know i was thinking about a song that i heard once a few years ago and in that song they were saying he took my place and you know it brought tears to my eyes just when you think about you think about how you know we were born in sin we were born into a mess we were born until a nature that desire to please the flesh that desire to to yield or to reach out to the things of the world that was only temporary that would only bring forth death that's how we were born into the world but christ when he died you know and shed his blood i know the prophet god said that that release god how did it release god through the shedding of his blood he says that it's it must go away that if i go away then the comforter he'll come in my name and he says that he'll teach you all things he says that i won't be with you but i'll be in you so what it is calvary done not only did the shedding of the blood uh uh uh take away our sins but it gave us the ability now to all of those who would desire and receive it to be one with god how can you be one with god by this by his spirit by the holy ghost living in you i was sharing i mean coming in you i was sharing with someone the other night i said the thing is i says it's it's you know it's a walk with god that you got to have i said the thing is i said you got to understand that that god ain't asking you to walk it on your own because he took your place he knew that you weren't able to do it so he was going to do something and that no longer would you be asked even to keep the laws in that way but he was gonna do something that he would cause you to walk in his statues and i said that's what you you got to learn yearn for you can't just say that i said the lord is calling you but you you can't just want to just be just come to church and just be church like that i said it might last for so long but you got to come on the other side you got to experience the riches so what calvary brought i said you got to go up to the to the upper room you got to go up to that place and then you'll see what what what what he's saying that two can't walk together except there'll be an agreement you'll see what he's saying about you know uh uh uh born again nature it's no longer that you know those desires and those things god has it did something a transformation as we say is taking place and you know that's what happens that's what lacks a lot of times in individuals lives because they they walk a long time they come to church a long time but they never go over to the other side you know he says that you know if you love god you'll hate the world come on and the things that are in it sometimes we look at our experience and we says you know i says the thing is you know jesus when when they was crucified him jesus even though he was there we could stay in the physical realm with them but yet he was in another place spiritually he can look at them and know that this wasn't a flesh and blood a battle or fight but this was a battle between god and satan he could look at them and say father forgive them because they don't know what they doing even though they looked at him and they says that he saved others but yet he can't save himself but the revelation of it was he didn't come to save himself he could have saved himself but i thank god his whole mission was to come and save you and i his mission was not to come and prove that he was god in that sense but he came on a mission that it's some souls that that's mine they were mine from the beginning come on god he says all the fathers giving me will come i ain't lost one they are mine i come to save them hallelujah so when he hung on that cross they said you say he saved others they mocking him come down he had a mission to save you and i and i thank god that he accomplished the mission to save us now it's up to us to freely receive what god has done hallelujah but i said that day you know god he done some great great things from where sin as we says had had paralyzed the world you know i was sharing with someone and and then they was talking to me the other day about some things was going on with them and they said you know what you think it could be and i says you know god it could be god warning you i said but i i can guarantee you one thing god don't bluff i said the devil bluff the devil will bluff but god won't bluff god said what he said he sent his word and it's going to accomplish what he sent it to do the thing that god intend to do no man can't stop it no man can't put forth hand nor foot unless god allowed god don't bluff i said so when god is calling he to call come on i thought about pharaoh i said i said you know moses those came down you know he might have thought that when moses was speaking the word of the lord him and aaron he might have thought that god was bluffing but god wasn't bluffing he found that out after egypt was destroyed come on i says that you know we got the we got to take guard take it when i say god don't bluff you know he doesn't bluff from either side i looked at it in malachi and how he says that you know my altar is polluted he started talking about the pollution and things on his altar wonder why sometimes you know things ain't happening for us things are lopsided or or you know things are taking place but let's stop for a moment and examine ourselves examine your walk come on god or open the gates of windows of heaven and pour out blessings but when we do things to separate ourselves from him because he promised that he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you but when we backslide in our spirit come on and walk away from him maybe he stops the windows of heaven come on but yet when we reunite back up with him it's nobody else's fault but your own come on reunite back up with him say lord that's why i was sharing with the person the other night i said you get down on your knees don't blame nobody else say lord it's me i said tell god you need his help tell god god i need your help lord i can't make it without you i say if you don't know how to pray just just tell god how much you need him tell god how much you need his help and i said he wants to help you you know he liking us to be lambs some creatures that have no kind of defense about themselves but they need a shepherd they need somebody to lead them and god knows that we helpless a lot of times we think that we can handle situations and do things on our own but god knows all he sets back sometimes and he waits because he knows that we can't do nothing without him but to recognize that and to recognize that i can't do nothing without you lord and god you did everything for me god the way it's already been made you know i was reading the other day of uh uh quoting from isaiah 53 you know and and just how god he handled every situation he settled every quest he on calvary he handled everything come on all of everything from every aspect god handle it all we got to do is freely receive it but you got to want it how many want it tonight but i says the thing is you know looking at looking at what god done for us how he settled the same question come on forever how god done that here on calvary i said look at what they done to him but he did it all he did it all because uh he did it all to take our place now to the world that's nonsense sometimes you try to explain to people uh uh that that they don't understand where you are what you're saying come on they think it's nonsense no man could live a certain way and true that no man can't but the holy ghost come on he's all in all when he comes down in you takes complete control lives his life through you that's what it is i said you know this world is i was in prayer the other day i said this world is in such bad shape it's in messed up shape i said lord i'll say it like this to be honest i said lord if you should tarry and all the older saints were to leave off the scene i said god we're going to need something we're going to need something more than what we got i said god we going to need a double triple portion because the world ain't getting no better it's getting more wicked and i said god we need another outporn to do what to carry on because though even men die god's spirit is still in the earth and if something happened you know that i could see that you know when they talked about the image and all the kingdoms but in the end there was a stone here out of the mountain that smote the image on the foot come on busted into pieces and the wind scattered it and that stone grew into a great mountain and talked about how you know the kingdom of god when it was established that would be it that would be the last kingdom i say lord i want to be in the kingdom lord i want to be a part of that kingdom oh hallelujah the world is in his condition going down but yet lord i'm still looking to you like we're saying the world is going down but lord i know you're taking us up how you know because you can feel something happening in your spirit you got faith like no other because you know that when these things are happening you beginning to look up hallelujah you're starting to lose like we say control because you're giving it all over to god you to the point the way you say lord here it is god oh god we know this has come to a showdown and god you're gonna have to take complete control you're gonna i'm gonna have to learn how to let go how many want to learn that tonight but i said that you know it's something about a calvary and and what it and what it wrought how like we say is how sin uh paralyzed the earth come on how you look at man's desires man's wants all the time all the things he ever want to do sin sin more come on never mention god now god never comes into his mind but he gets further and further away but then yet you have those you have something down on the inside of you still crying out for that old-time religion still crying out for that old fashioned outpouring of the holy ghost something that's going to make you walk right something that's going to make you talk right something that's going to make you let go of all the world and the world desire to get your mind back on that hey this isn't i'm just a stranger a pilgrim passing through i'm not from here i'm here on a mission and that's to do what to get back to where i came from something to get you your mind back in tune with god how many want that tonight i didn't intend to be long i mighta was real short but i said calvary what calvary brought come on i just wanted to get your mind back to thinking about you know what god done for you like i said he took my place he took your place but he even though he freely give it he don't force himself on you you got to freely come come on and once you come learn how to yield and let go and let god do the rest amen the private talk about that day on calvary amen praise god that day on calvary amen i often times talk about if the devil knew what he was doing he would have never did it the bible said had he known he would not have crucified the lord of glory but the devil didn't know what killing jesus amen would do jesus he knew the bible said with the joy that set before him he endured the cross despised the shame oh yeah that's some shame they stripped them naked they put a cloth on the crucifix but they stripped him naked no clothes shame but he did it all for you and i just think if you were strong enough powerful enough to call 12 legions of angels and all you needed was just one called 12 legion of angels to come to his rescue but because he loved us enough if we can only love like god loved us if we can only forgive proves our love it's a proof that we love because jesus in forgiving our sins and dive our sins he proved how much he cared about us you know we can't forgive somebody that just do just a little something to us we won't forgive them we won't give them a second chance we won't even hear them when they say i'm sorry but jesus that there on calvary he proved that uh uh brother ernie said he spit on him some said if you be the christ why don't you save yourself come down from the cross you know that he had the power to do it brother character is not a gift it's a victory god you we must in order to have character we must overcome some things it's a victory the very heart of god was on display on calvary the very love of god was on display on calvary brothers see how far we are away from the expression and from god using us in such a way you think about the next time somebody do you wrong you know i i today even the day i was just praying just praying praying praying i said god i don't want nothing to hinder me in my walk with you if there's anything lord touch me try me lord make i want to make certain brother and sister on this journey you must make you must be certain of god you must be certain that amen it's not how you feel about yourself that you are approved of god but the very manifestation of the living god is expressing himself through you it's not what you can do or what you have achieved or done it's god in you getting his glory back are you with me the only thing you can give god is what he gave to you are you with me and if he gave it to you then you tell me what are you doing for god or what are you giving god i can hear that song i give back to you all you gave to me i i forgot i go to the it was a sister in detroit we had a little mission going in detroit and i heard it for the first time and boy i i i look like it rains and i never can forget latune she sung so beautifully it was all executive people from the corporation world and and i was just probably out of place all these executive people but by the grace of god they will come to hear the gospel but by the grace of god i'm going to say to you what god gave to you give it back to him amen and when you give it back you got to realize it don't belong to you anyway some brother gordon tells me all the time about paying tithes he said brad i ain't got no problem with that don't belong to me anyway you see what i'm saying and i said thank the lord see what we give to god we got to realize it don't belong to us anyway all that we have god gave it to us it don't belong to us it belongs to god jesus amen knew that he came from god and he was going back to god he realized on calvary i got to express how to love amen i i i i i i i'm a show and i'm a manifest to you the love of god brother and sister every christian ought to reexamine their cells and look to calvary and see what calvary means to each and every one of us every time i look at calvary and as brother ernest was sharing with us the night minister league let's look at calvary let's take a good look at it and let's examine our faith let's examine do we love him for what he's done for us do we truly love god and if we love him we got no problem with doing what he asked us to do for him because we realize what he's done for us we can never repay are you with me we can never repay all that god has done for us we can never give enough we can never do enough all of our services all that we do don't you think about man when you do it do it as unto the lord and god will bless you hey god your blessings will come abundantly because that the song said you cannot beat god-given no matter how hard you try you'll never even be god-given are you with me so brothers and sisters give and god will give back to you amen i'm not talking about how these prosperity preachers i can't i wonder why i can't never quote that scripture i can quote uh chapters and all kind and i never could quote that you're to give and god would give to you press down and run it over you know i i i ca see because i think they made a mockery of it to just get money out of people but people be blessed now but nevertheless they just don't rip people awesome but i i i like to say it in the way of your life what you do for god and your your service and what you do for god amen god will give it back to you amen press down running over are you with me you usually just do all you can do and watch god just keep blessing keep on blessing spiritually i i you know the natural blessing is all right but i wanted spiritual blessings amen i i want the spirit of god i want to i want god use me to your glory god god i want to see the sick heal i want to see the blind sing lord i want to see your power in my life i want to know that you're god i want to know that you're with me that means so much to me [Music] i'm all right now i'm all right now ever since i gave my heart to jesus well i'm all right now [Music] all right all right now that i'm all right all right now said i'm all right i'm all right said i'm alright ever since i gave my heart to you ever since i [Music] said i'm all right
