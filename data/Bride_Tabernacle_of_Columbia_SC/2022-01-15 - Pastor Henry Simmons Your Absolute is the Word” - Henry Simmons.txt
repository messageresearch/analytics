chapter not going to be long at all tonight just trusting that amen god just amen give us a word tonight amen appreciate them and each and every one of you i know it's 2022 and we appreciate amen uh what god did last year amen and what he has been doing with us you know it's good even to be alive in this hour well amen and all that god has taken us through and brought us through amen appreciate i wanted to say again i appreciate brother caleb i heard that the message there on uh growth uh really was a blessing a lot of things was said and i appreciate seeing god just begin to develop him and bring him in many ways he wants him to be amen so we greet every one of you tonight and sing for marian greet you in jesus christ name everybody's doing well amen ballot and fighting the same devil you fighting here we fight near amen but god is good amen uh regardless of what we go through and what we have to deal with we know we're not relying upon ourself we trusting in god amen so saint john the 14th chapter and let's start at the um 15th verse i'ma cut it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever i like that even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while in the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you should know that i am in the my father and he in me and i and you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be love of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him i want to skip down to the um 23rd jesus asked and said unto him if a man loved me he would keep my words my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our bold with him he didn't loveth me not keeping not my saying and the word which he hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father is sending my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you peace i leave you with peace i leave you with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid father we ask you to bless the word tonight lord and quicken it in jesus name amen may be seated i also want to turn to another scripture um go right over to saint john i'm going to just read 16 and 7. saint john 16 7. nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away but if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment amen appreciate the lord tonight there i want to just uh for a few minutes tonight talk to you on a little thought that came to our hearts and i entitled it i believe i gave them your comforter your comforter but i really sub topic my comforter my comforter and the reason why i wanted to say like that because i'm understanding that um the things that god has uh given to you and i and it's our thing that uh he have put inside of the word and promises that he has uh given to the believers but i'm finding out that if we don't accept those things in a personalized way and understanding that these things are ours and getting more a little more specific their minds and we have to take it personally because god give it personally each one of us has these promises that god has given and he made it available he made it so that you don't even have to work for it he freely gave his life that you and i can be beneficiaries of what he has done at calvary on calvary when he before he by head he said it is finished in other words everything that he ever wanted to accomplish it was done and it wasn't something as we read it here it said when he come so it was one person it was one god that made this provision he he did it so and he must have seen in this hour that we were going to need a comforter and all that is going on in this hour all that's going on in our life all the things that we're having to deal with it can bring great sorrow to you but when i look inside of the word you know we find consolation that god just didn't leave us empty-handed he just didn't leave us without any kind of hope or without any kind of um uh something we can rest on he gave us the word and that word that god gave us it cannot change the bible say my word it has gone out of my mouth and it shall not return void so we have comfort that though we go through god is able to take care of it i think about and look it up in real not really because i thought about it now looking in this dictionary to see what our comforter really is and it says one that gives comfort you know what i thought about that and you know as humans beings we uh have loved ones and we uh sympathize with people because of tragedy and and because of mishap you know that that happens in their life but really uh that don't really bring the comfort that they really need and it's more we sympathize because we know that it could have been me but the real comforter god wants to uh the bible say hear that that it will be with you forever in other words it will never leave you if god could ever find a place that he can abide in us and that's what he wants he said in my word about it you and you by my word then you can act what you want and i'm learning i'm learning after years and you know just recently i had a birthday intern i'm not 60 yet i always tell my kid i'm already 60. oh well my next birthday i'll be 60 and we just had a wedding anniversary on a new year's night and every 32 years and and i just look back in 32 years and say lord look what you did you know and the things that uh that i say personally i know that you can relate because you got your own testimony and i was just looking at uh my life i had a flashback and and i was just looking at lord the things that i've been through and god i know it had to be you brought me through it because i know that i really shouldn't be here you know i know and you can testify yourself that god has brought us through some treacherous situation but in all i love it y'all we're still here and and that's enough by itself to say god thank you and you may look at your faults you may look at your mistake but y'all god been good i mean he's been so good to where he was better to us than we've been to our own self i was telling the church becky marion that you know as a human being we are self-destructive people and don't even realize that you know we do more damage to our own self because of a lack of understanding what it gonna cost us but even though through all of that that's why that song appreciates the charlotte sing that song the lord knows i'm gonna try to sing myself since the charlotte but you did it you must be saved me the trouble you know but and i look at it that even though when we think god is not working he's working it out oh yes i i was telling brother dan say you know i just woke up this morning and it was such a burden in my heart and i just felt the presence of god being so real there and i said lord i said thank you i said you know because it's something that in the midst of the talmud and all that's going on that you still can have joy and you say well daddy let me tell you something if you ever uh lose it you'll realize how important it really is and what is it it's because of god's grace that had kept us through all that we went through and yet yes we had triumphed yes we had this and yes we had that but god is still good the comforter he's comforted us through all kinds of situations and conditions there is nobody can comfort you like jesus can that's why it is it's so urgent and i'm just thinking without the holy ghost you really don't understand the fullness of the comfort that god gives you even when you don't feel good you realize god it could have been worse than this oh yes sir uh i guess i'll tell a little more y'all not that part but my little testimony my wife kind of over there she said i'll learn more about you in the pool but i do at home you know so something i just don't say too much about you know into the law but it dawned on me today and i said you know you look at your situation and i can look at mine and i can remember so vividly you know when i went through my little more you know and you don't really know what it is ain't no standing if you have to uh stand before a judge or a situation in your life and you don't know what the outcome gonna be because the penalty you know that comes with the choices we make as i say we are self-destructive people we do more damage to our own stuff because of a like of understanding and because that we just don't want to listen sometimes and then when you have to suffer the consequences and i understood those consequences that when what i did in my life and i understand now here i am you know i don't know which way gonna go uh a height gonna turn out because i knew i didn't had no kind of a financial support or loyal support you know the only thing i had was one thing and that was that god was beginning to deal with me and god gave me uh a peace and he gave me a word about it too and i'm not saying this to be funny or or that that but you know uh even when the the troubles have happened and i sat there facing this job here with 200 and something years in prison but guess what i wasn't even threatened about it one bit i wasn't shaking i looked through your arm in his face and tell me sir i did those things i said but i am sorry i said i know that don't mean much now i should have thought more about it before i got to this point but i didn't i said i wasn't raised that way i mean he told me those things went up but what had happened early previously as i was walking around my neighborhood and you know you really think about life and you look at life as what is it really all about and sometimes as the devil always paint the picture the having a good time but you'll find out it ain't a good time because what it costs is you and the penalty and what you have to deal with because of your own decisions and i like to say that no matter what decision you make whether it's good or bad you got to live with it i tell my children sometime i said lord i wish i would really back into school with a little boy again i'll be real good if i could take them years back instead of giving the teachers all that problem and not doing what i ought to be i said i'll be a student but guess what it's gone i can't take it back sometime as adult we wish my daughter would say lord have mercy if i know a daughter who will come in all this right here you'll stay a child young as you can as old as you can because it comes with responsibility it comes with making decision it come with whatever decision you make you're going to have to deal with that the rest of your life but i was going to uh before my hearing and i went by this place and you know i always say that you know when god deals with a person god don't need no help because when god do it he do it right a lot of times we try to help god out with it but a lot of if we just can pray and let god work it out let god handle it because god knows how and when and what to do and a lot of times we don't get the right results because we always want to try to do something to help god out but god may not work fast like you want to but i want to tell you when he works he works and when he works right it lastes too but if somebody force you in and push you to do it and twist you to do it you would do it for a little while but guess what that'll weigh off i remember the servant of god had told they were his deacon one time and billy paul had did some things and he was in the church that brother baptist was preaching so hard you know on saying different things and deacon you know he he kind of pushed billy paul to go up there and and get prayed for it but because don't you never do that he said because with god dealing with him then god gonna deal with him see and god knows how he knows when you know and sometimes it'd be a rough way but sometimes that's god's best way because when you get it you got it and i can remember you know so vividly that as i was walking you know what like my hair was coming i went by where we used to live at and the house was torn down and everything you know but as i was walking past there and uh something that spoke to my heart and told me you're gonna have to go away but it's gonna work out for you good and i'm saying to myself you know i know i might be crazy you know but hai is going for this man here and not knowing what's going to happen you know and i know i'm doomed because i'm guilty you know but even when i went to the courtroom i had such a peace not because i'd be glad to go to jail now you know but it's just that something had begun to happen and let me tell you something i wasn't going to no church during that time either i haven't even heard anything about the message of the hour i know i had a mother that prayed and i know that she prayed for us but then even after all the debt i had to went down a certain course because of my own stubbornness because of my own choice i made them choices so i began to tell him don't none of y'all come to that courthouse none i said i'm gonna be okay you're gonna work out for my good and i stood there one of my sisters still came you know what not but another rest of them came but you know when i stood there you know and i think about it now i said lord you've been even comforted me when i was in era and you gave me a peace even when i could have got life sentences but when i stood there and in the whole time this process going through i never was worried about when i'm gonna get out and how it is you know because god was dealing with me he gave me a peace within me and i know that i haven't i didn't have the holy ghost then no no it just i was the spirit of god was dealing with me and he was taking me somewhere and i'm gonna tell you young people if you just listen to that voice of god it may be a voice that screamed it may not take you to be the popular way but it'll be the best way because everything i found out that god does is for our own good even sometimes the road he allow us to go through oh my when you look back on it and you say god thank you so much because i'm about to kill my own self but the comforter and i can remember uh you know after we came down he moved um in marion got married and all and me and my wife we had uh talked to brother simmons and i believe that um prior to that meeting he will be having brother john simon up here for service uh weekend services um and so we talked about seven prior to that before that and we were just talking to him about the holy ghost with my wife you know that we wasn't sure we needed some kind of you know proof of some something that you know that we are know you know that we have it and brother john simon had preached that night and that was his thought the holy ghost and i'm telling you something he thundered that message so and he preached his soul and we went back home that particular night you know and i and i told my wife i said look i said i'm gonna stay up here i'm gonna pray i say because i got to know i got to have it you know i said because i wasn't certain you know i know something had happened but it's just something yes there wasn't deep enough you know within me and that night and we stayed up a good little while that night i don't know how long but i remember so vividly how that when we cried out and we cried pull our hearts out to god there and and the holy ghost came down in such a way i'm telling you about the earthquake i felt like i had one that night in the house i mean it just shook you know like the whole house had shook and like something just thundered down fire and i began just to holler out and start praising god you know what not because i know something had happened and from that time my life has never been the same again yes it was still a spiritual growth caleb even after you get baptized in the holy ghost it's a growth and god begin to lead you in and to teach you and begin to deal with you because we've got to grow up and as we did that for one state to the next you know god empowered and began to do things in our lives you know and i know i couldn't do it see and that's what i look at the things that i know i couldn't do god did it the peace and the love of god that came in me that you know i didn't have no enemies i wasn't looking for no it's just like everything but just uh just i ca you can't uh explain it but i know he came what was it the comforter and i like it when i thought about it the other day and just dropped on my on my heart and that i will never leave you you know people will leave you you know sometimes your husband a wife and children but the comforter he will be with you forever through everything that you are dealing with ain't got to go through he's right there they say i'm saying even in the midnight hour when you're all alone and nobody seems to even know what you are dealing with he's still there and he began you know just to give you a little peaceful assurance yeah i'm with you i know you might seem like you alone but you are not alone because i'm the comforter you know what i'm the one that's keeping you i'm the one that's bringing you where i want i'm the one that calls you and i called you to myself and what i want for you is to submit your life to me and let me take over you didn't have your time you didn't mess it up now i'm gonna show you how i can do it without your help i'll tell you what it's getting so good i was just thinking you know and i hope that you feel the same way my christian experience is is much enhanced than than it has ever been things that i'm reading and things that i'm even going back and looking over i'm wondering whether or not i ever read it i know i have but now it's coming alive the word is just not uh um for peter and paul and mary but now it's mine see it is yours but until you accept this book the holy bible as being for you you've been living on things that somebody else did and don't do that because god got so much he want to show you see we're in the days that we're written epistles god in flesh through jesus christ now i'm jesus in flesh in a minimum of bride god tabernacling in earthly vessels again to do what finish the work didn't let he say the works that i do you gonna do what who is you who isn't you i don't know about you but it's me see because this book uh we like to say i hear people say about the open book let me tell you something it ain't open to you if you're walking in the thing that god spoke of you you know and i said yeah the seventh c but that book ain't open to you if you're not walking in the light of the age that god gave you the promise that's why the bible say that these signs shall follow who who is them i mean they remember bride you gotta go forth and show that this god we talking about oh sister iris said he is not dead he is still alive how do you know because i feel him in my feet i feel him in my hand he lives within me it's him that keeping me and not me myself yeah i got proof of his resurrection because like paul said the life that i now live i live it by the son of god this life that i live the server god said you want to know whether or not you've been changed or not he said look at what you were and look at where you at now and he said that you don't see what you done but you see what god has done for you and that what give me more hope and more consolation that i was telling them saying i said you can't even trust your own self this flesh i have no confidence in it because you have to kill this thing you have to let it die and you don't want to die but you got to kill it and that god can live in you let me just read one thing okay the seventh he said now i believe that on the day of pentecost he said the comforter which is the holy spirit was given which is the spirit of jesus christ given to the church and he lives in his church his people tonight just as he lived with them in the body of flesh the flesh had to die in order to make a sacrifice to redeem us back to god to pay the penalty of death that we committed see that's what he did for us he paid the penalty of death that we committed god bless you tonight praise the lord amen thank god for the word tonight the comforter has come amen thank god for the confidence coming in our lives tonight because without the comfort of where would we be amen he the spirit of truth has come amen giving us peace in the midst of the storm confident in the midst of all the situations and all that going on in this world god has given us confidence consolation and knowing that one day soon the lord is coming i was talking to sister oh john the other day she's just turned 88 years old and uh she liked to say and i think she just got loose and got on fire and she was preaching a little while to me she said she believe it with all my heart the lord is soon to come brother simmons and i said thank the lord amen all i could say is amen i couldn't get a word in i just say amen so you stirred up so i thank god for her and i tell you brother and sister and then i was preaching last week there and as i was preaching them the power of the holy ghost came down in him the church just got on fire and the young man came up sister bowie was telling about how she was shouting she didn't know what happened jesus went to dancing in the spirit said something got a hole on them but by the grace of god that's what we want something spontaneous praise not something we have to work up not something we have to fold something we have to prime up but just the holy ghost spontaneous praise amen god getting a hold of us amen not somebody coaching you into it and talking you into it but just something that happens amen the holy ghost get in the hole he said the prophet of god said that's the way to you know tongues come interpretation of song you don't think what you're gonna say you don't know what you're gonna say it just happened are you with me so by the grace of god we thank god tonight for the conference tonight thank god for brother palmer lord we thank god for you amen not only that you know we got a lot of prayer requests and you know i said a young man came up uh after sir uh during the time we asked everybody i want to give the life to the lord young man teenager come up by
