[37:33] Christ's name we pray amen and amen
[37:38] God is good amen
[37:42] we want to look tonight for a moment at
[37:44] Romans 8 by the grace of God
[37:50] Romans 8 and we'll begin here at the
[37:54] 20 27 verse very familiar scriptures
[38:06] Romans 8 and 27.
[38:10] we gotta say man
[38:13] and it reads
[38:15] and he that searches the heart knoweth
[38:17] what is in the mind of the spirit
[38:19] because he maketh intercession for the
[38:22] Saints according to the will of God
[38:25] and we know that all things work
[38:28] together
[38:29] for good to them that love God
[38:32] to them who are called who are the
[38:35] called according to his purpose you may
[38:37] be seated
[38:38] we'll read a little further down
[38:42] for him for whom he did for know he also
[38:46] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[38:49] image of his son that he might be the
[38:51] firstborn amongst many Brethren moreover
[38:54] whom he did predestinate then he also
[38:57] called whom he called then we also
[39:00] justified in whom he justified then he
[39:03] also glorified what shall we say then
[39:07] to these things if God before us then
[39:11] who can be against us
[39:13] he that Spirit not his own son but
[39:15] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[39:17] not with him also freely give us all
[39:20] things
[39:21] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[39:24] God's elect it is God that justifies who
[39:27] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[39:30] died yea brother that has that is risen
[39:34] again who is even at the right hand of
[39:36] God who also making intercession for us
[39:39] who shall separate us from the love of
[39:42] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[39:45] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[39:48] perilous reward as it is written for thy
[39:50] sake we are killed all the day long we
[39:54] are counted as sheep for the slaughter
[39:56] name and all these things we are more
[40:00] than conquerors through him that loved
[40:02] us for I am persuaded that neither death
[40:05] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[40:07] nor powers nor things present nor things
[40:11] to come nor height nor death nor any
[40:14] other creature shall be able to separate
[40:16] us from the love of God which is in
[40:19] Christ Jesus our Lord may God bless you
[40:23] reading of his word again tonight by the
[40:25] grace of God I just want to minister
[40:29] on the topic and I entitled it
[40:31] overcoming amen overcoming is very
[40:34] familiar scripture and this you know
[40:37] very
[40:38] beautiful reading there and just talking
[40:41] about the things and the trials of this
[40:43] life and and how you know I like how
[40:46] Paul
[40:47] began to talk about it he says that he
[40:51] says that in all these things we're
[40:53] still more than conquerors you know you
[40:55] begin to talk about that you know uh
[40:57] here in the in the 28th verse that we
[41:01] know that all things work together for
[41:04] the good
[41:05] to them that love God
[41:07] so many times we say that scripture as
[41:11] we're saying on Sunday that all things
[41:13] are going to work together
[41:14] but it's only going to work together to
[41:17] the good for those that love God
[41:19] and I said though you know do you love
[41:22] God tonight
[41:24] you gotta love them
[41:25] if you love them you'll keep his
[41:27] Commandments if you love God you'll do
[41:30] whatever God asks you to do
[41:32] and that's the thing about it says why
[41:35] isn't it working for me
[41:37] you know but he says that all things
[41:39] will work together for the good of them
[41:41] that love God
[41:42] and I believe that Paul here tonight was
[41:45] talking with her to Surety
[41:47] with a where the um you know with an
[41:49] assurity in his Christian walk
[41:52] because of that he can look back at all
[41:54] of the trials and the situations and his
[41:57] struggles and his battles and even in
[42:00] all those things he knew that he was
[42:02] still able to stand
[42:03] and all those things he hadn't lost his
[42:06] testimony he still was uh holding that
[42:09] same testimony from the very beginning
[42:12] because that's why he can say these
[42:14] things and all these things he says I'm
[42:16] persuaded that none of these things
[42:18] ain't gonna move me
[42:19] he says you know because we are more
[42:23] than conquerors and one thing that we
[42:25] have working on our side tonight I says
[42:28] that we got election working on our side
[42:32] election and is working by grace
[42:35] So I says that what it is you we we
[42:38] realize sometimes you know you can go
[42:40] through life and look at the things you
[42:43] achieved I made these achievements I've
[42:45] done this I've achieved that so you
[42:48] might be afraid sometimes that you know
[42:50] you see people that they work all their
[42:52] life and do things and then when their
[42:54] achievements seem to crumble right
[42:56] before the eyes they might commit
[42:59] suicide or they might jump off a
[43:01] building they don't have nothing to live
[43:02] for because all they ever work for
[43:04] crumbled right before their eyes all
[43:07] their achievements but it's something
[43:09] about being saved tonight I says that
[43:12] you know it ain't what I achieve but
[43:15] it's what God did for me
[43:17] is not that I could work enough to
[43:19] obtain the grace of God but it was
[43:23] through election that God gave us
[43:25] tonight the only way I can be here the
[43:27] only way you can be here tonight is
[43:29] through election and that's why Paul can
[43:31] stand there assured knowing telling the
[43:34] people that those who God called he said
[43:37] who can lay anything to the charge of
[43:39] God's elect
[43:40] for those that he called he already uh
[43:44] it says here he says he says for them
[43:46] who he foreknew he also predestinated to
[43:49] be formed to the image of his son that
[43:51] he might be the firstborn among many
[43:53] brother and more over whom he did
[43:55] predestinate them he also called and
[43:58] then we in whom he called them he
[44:00] justified and whom he justified them
[44:03] also have glorified so you know from the
[44:07] very beginning it was already a finished
[44:08] work
[44:09] God foreknew you that's what that's what
[44:13] we come into reckon with and you know
[44:14] the devil don't want you to realize that
[44:16] he wants you to stay at a place the way
[44:18] you're always battling him you're always
[44:20] struggling you're always fighting within
[44:22] yourself but to come to the knowledge of
[44:24] it that I was foreknown of God
[44:27] come on God foreknew me
[44:30] and one day he he just called my my name
[44:34] and not in the spirit and I had no other
[44:36] choice but to come forth
[44:38] he says them before predestinated for a
[44:41] new he already predestinated he already
[44:43] called us he called us come on and as he
[44:46] called us he justified us you know the
[44:50] life that you live you couldn't help but
[44:52] live that life because that was the
[44:54] spirit that was in you
[44:56] but when God came along
[44:58] come on and he called you right then
[45:01] things begin to work and in your favor
[45:04] no matter what condition you're at place
[45:06] you're at when God began to call you
[45:08] things already begin working in your
[45:09] favor
[45:11] and then why because that election took
[45:14] over
[45:14] he called you he justifies you you came
[45:17] to that point you knew you were rotten
[45:20] and all
[45:21] you knew that you didn't have a right to
[45:23] even stand in the congregation of God
[45:25] with the children of God but when God
[45:28] calls you come on he justifies you
[45:31] he brought you to that place and where
[45:33] you couldn't hold your head up but when
[45:35] you did hold your head up you saw
[45:36] Calvary
[45:37] you saw it with God yes you couldn't
[45:40] make it yes you wouldn't you you so
[45:43] filthy that you can't stand in the
[45:45] presence of God you were born that way
[45:48] you come in the world that way
[45:50] but when God called you Hallelujah and
[45:53] he lifted up your heads and you saw
[45:55] Calvary
[45:56] you saw a bloody lamb you saw your
[45:59] sacrifice you saw your way of Escape
[46:02] that now when you stand before God you
[46:05] ain't standing alone
[46:06] but you're standing and he's looking at
[46:08] you not book or where your life is but
[46:10] he's looking at you through the blood
[46:11] that he shed for you come on the devil
[46:14] don't want you to think like that he
[46:16] don't want you to he he that's what it
[46:19] is he'll hold uh things over your head
[46:21] he'll hold you uh uh in bondage the way
[46:24] you can't be free to worship God the way
[46:26] you can't be free to to serve the Living
[46:28] God he hold things over your head hold
[46:30] things over you come on but God through
[46:33] the word tonight want to break those
[46:35] chains off of you he want to break that
[46:37] thing off you so you can be free to
[46:39] worship God
[46:40] it's they talk about the Caged Bird he
[46:43] got those wings but he can't fly they
[46:45] can give him all kind of nutritious meat
[46:48] and all those things or whatever they
[46:49] might give them but yet he's still a
[46:50] caged bird those wings ain't doing them
[46:52] no good but yet when if you open that
[46:56] cage and he's able to get out there and
[46:58] flap those wings and fly come on then he
[47:01] know that God gave him those wings for a
[47:04] reason
[47:05] come on they get out there and use them
[47:07] to reach Heights that some of the other
[47:11] animals can't reach
[47:12] go in the Realms that nobody else can't
[47:14] go into and that's what it is tonight
[47:16] the Holy Spirit I believe that wants to
[47:19] set you free
[47:20] don't want you to be caged up come on I
[47:23] know we're talking about denomination
[47:24] organization realm you know the the cage
[47:27] of every foul and unclean hateful bird
[47:30] we know that but then yet the devil can
[47:32] have you caged up here tonight
[47:34] cage it up in your mind cage up in your
[47:37] situation come on yet God has given you
[47:40] the word to strengthen you he's giving
[47:43] you something the spirit in this age the
[47:46] sore above to Fly Above All your trials
[47:48] Fly Above All these Earthly things and
[47:50] situations come on but yet you still
[47:53] sitting in the cage Hallelujah I said
[47:56] but God what I want to do Give Me Faith
[47:59] but step out of that cage
[48:01] Give Me Faith God to fly high into the
[48:03] heavens high above all these situations
[48:06] how many want that tonight
[48:08] but I says that what it is
[48:10] you know Paul here can say those things
[48:13] and and many times we look at uh the the
[48:17] Christian journey and many people you
[48:20] know they want to be labeled to overcome
[48:21] or labeled you know he always in each
[48:24] age he gave a salutation out to him that
[48:26] overcoming come on he said to him that
[48:29] overcometh so each age had something
[48:32] they had to overcome
[48:33] you I was saying the other day like
[48:36] what's it what's with being a warrior
[48:39] but that but don't want to fight
[48:41] want to be labeled a warrior but don't
[48:42] want to fight
[48:44] we want to be labeled uh Victorious but
[48:47] you don't you didn't have no battles
[48:49] I was saying that you know I always tell
[48:51] the children that I'm a I'm a war
[48:54] veteran I'm a combat veteran
[48:56] you know
[48:57] and it's the truth
[48:59] you know I says that because they told
[49:01] us when I was in the military 911 uh
[49:05] when it happened it was an attack on
[49:07] American Saul
[49:08] so we all got combat veteran status
[49:12] you know so I said I could say I'm
[49:15] Overcomer I'm a combat veteran
[49:18] but it ain't the same as I talked to
[49:20] somebody that been in World War II
[49:22] or being out there in Vietnam that ain't
[49:24] the same
[49:25] somebody say I'm a I'm a combat veteran
[49:28] and you get amongst those boys that
[49:30] really been through something
[49:31] you get amongst those people that really
[49:34] had to deal with something
[49:36] and you hear them stories about those
[49:38] bullets and how they said they hit off
[49:39] the wall and they said the movies uh
[49:42] play it this way and you hear like a a
[49:44] zip or whatever he said but it ain't
[49:46] like that they said you hear a quick
[49:48] crack he quick crack so that's what
[49:51] you're hearing and says that you get so
[49:53] used to the sound that every time you
[49:55] hear that crack you realize okay it
[49:56] didn't hit me so they got stories they
[49:59] got the Tails they got battles and
[50:01] struggles that they went through
[50:03] Hallelujah and they can say that we
[50:06] overcame now
[50:08] brother Ernest how did you overcome
[50:11] but I say it's what it is
[50:13] you want to be labeled a warrior
[50:15] a combat veteran but don't want to fight
[50:18] don't want to get into battles but I
[50:21] want to say it ain't so with all the
[50:22] soldiers that's in God's Army
[50:24] the soldiers that's in his army
[50:26] everybody got combat experience and if
[50:29] you ain't got none it's on the way
[50:30] Hallelujah All God's Children Hallelujah
[50:34] got battles that they've been through we
[50:36] look at those Heroes of Faith what did
[50:39] they go through some thrown here some
[50:41] thrown there all that women you know uh
[50:45] had their babies taken away from them
[50:46] all those uh uh
[50:49] ugly things that might have happened in
[50:51] their life but yet they went down as
[50:53] Heroes they went down as War veterans
[50:55] they went down as soldiers of the Cross
[50:58] Hallelujah they've been through
[51:01] something but I believe the Bible says
[51:03] that God ain't forgot about them they
[51:05] gave up this life that they might be
[51:06] able to receive a better Resurrection
[51:08] they knew that like like like uh Moses
[51:11] he chose rather to suffer in Affliction
[51:14] with the children of God rather to enjoy
[51:16] the pleasures of sin for a season he
[51:18] knew that it was a battlefield it wasn't
[51:20] a picnic he knew that he had to fight he
[51:22] had to go to war Hallelujah so he went
[51:25] didn't he come on and God ain't forgot
[51:27] about him they overcame I said and
[51:29] that's what it is we can have claims you
[51:31] know I says that you know we can have
[51:34] all those claims but it never had a
[51:36] never had a fight never had a real
[51:38] challenge
[51:39] it's a difference when you meet a real
[51:41] challenge
[51:42] you know you can fight all the time and
[51:45] nobody's on your level but when you meet
[51:47] a challenge
[51:48] that's what's going to bring out the
[51:49] worry in you that's going to bring out
[51:52] the weakness in you that's going to
[51:54] bring out uh uh the side of you that you
[51:57] didn't know that existed
[51:58] but you need that side to be brought out
[52:01] that way you can deal with it that's
[52:03] what these trials and these tribulations
[52:05] he says uh I'm persuaded and none of
[52:08] these things is going to separate us
[52:10] from the love of God come on God ain't
[52:12] gonna let you go all the way down he got
[52:14] you he gonna hold you come on but you
[52:18] got to realize that God is doing
[52:19] something in me
[52:21] God is doing something with my life
[52:24] yes it's gold but it's being tried right
[52:27] now in the fire
[52:28] but when it come out Hallelujah I like
[52:31] that song they say please be patient
[52:33] with me God ain't through with me yet
[52:36] but when God gets through with me imma
[52:39] come forth as pure gold and I want to
[52:42] say that tonight just as I ask you to be
[52:45] patient with me Hallelujah I'm gonna be
[52:47] patient with you because God ain't
[52:49] through what you get oh that excites me
[52:52] to know that even though God has brought
[52:54] us through many trials many mountains
[52:56] many valleys guarding through with us
[52:58] yet
[52:59] Hallelujah
[53:01] bigger Trials come bigger mountains come
[53:04] bigger situations come but God ain't
[53:07] through with us yet Hallelujah I like
[53:10] the other other week in the little bible
[53:12] study I've been stirred up and I was
[53:14] saying how you know Charlotte was
[53:17] bringing out that you know they talk
[53:19] about overcoming but it ain't how it
[53:23] ain't what you got to overcome
[53:24] as much as you got to look at how you're
[53:27] going to overcome it
[53:29] you know in each age they had to
[53:30] overcome but the devil will have you
[53:33] looking at what you got to overcome
[53:35] instead of remembering how you're gonna
[53:37] overcome it Hallelujah
[53:39] you know the devil will do that morning
[53:42] I think about those 10 spies when they
[53:45] went into the land they was looking at
[53:47] what they had to overcome didn't they
[53:50] instead of how they was going to
[53:51] overcome it but Joshua and Caleb had a
[53:54] different spirit
[53:55] they weren't looking at what they had to
[53:57] overcome
[53:58] because they already knew how they've
[54:00] been overcoming
[54:01] they know that they've been overcoming
[54:05] through the blood by the by the blood
[54:07] Hallelujah they know they've been
[54:08] Overcoming By that great Jehovah
[54:11] that same one that brought him out of
[54:13] Egypt Hallelujah it wasn't how it wasn't
[54:16] what they had to face with or what they
[54:18] had to deal with but they knew how they
[54:20] were going to handle it oh Jesus I said
[54:24] that stirred me in my spirit to know
[54:26] every situation
[54:28] it's a challenge Hallelujah I'm not
[54:31] worried about what I gotta face with
[54:32] those 10 spots worried about the Giants
[54:35] they in the land yes we're in our own
[54:37] eyes as grasshoppers before them
[54:39] worrying about what they had to face but
[54:42] forgetting how they been overcoming
[54:45] Joshua and Caleb knew that he said yeah
[54:48] he says our guard is able we're more
[54:50] than able because they knew
[54:53] how they were going to overcome it
[54:56] they knew they didn't get themselves
[54:58] there by coincidence about it fighting
[55:01] Hallelujah
[55:02] but it was by faith that they got there
[55:06] and it was by faith that they was going
[55:08] to get on
[55:09] Hallelujah and I say that tonight I
[55:12] believe that with all of my heart every
[55:14] situation no matter how minor how major
[55:16] I'm not looking at it I know how
[55:19] Hallelujah
[55:20] I thought about David he wasn't looking
[55:23] at Goliath what he had to overcome but
[55:25] he was looking at how he was going to
[55:27] overcome it
[55:28] Hallelujah God brought me through so
[55:31] many times
[55:33] I'm not worried about the life today
[55:37] because he'll be just as one of them
[55:40] well what you gonna do Hallelujah I'm
[55:42] gonna do what I always done
[55:45] I'm gonna put it in God's hand
[55:46] Hallelujah I'm a trusting God that's
[55:49] what I'm gonna do Hallelujah it worked
[55:52] in times past and it'll work now oh
[55:54] Jesus y'all believe that tonight come on
[55:57] if it worked then it'll work now he
[55:59] never failed me yet
[56:01] oh David now said we're going to give
[56:04] you the arm and the sword saw on David
[56:06] told him I didn't even prove these I
[56:09] don't know how to use them Hallelujah
[56:11] take them away from me what you gonna
[56:13] use I'm gonna use what's already been
[56:15] proven
[56:16] hallelujah oh Jesus and that's what it
[56:20] is come on and that's I'm gonna say
[56:22] tonight no matter how big the situation
[56:24] is now
[56:25] no matter what you face with
[56:28] the word Can it can handle it
[56:31] the word can handle it
[56:33] you know we're starting another week in
[56:35] how Jesus talked about how Jesus he hid
[56:38] behind the word because he was a word
[56:41] but he hid behind it every time the
[56:43] devil came at him he had the word he hid
[56:45] behind the word he wouldn't come from
[56:46] back though come on it's written
[56:49] it's written because the devil couldn't
[56:51] do nothing with the word could he don't
[56:54] you know the word is your fortification
[56:56] the word is your absolute
[56:59] come on the word don't you know that
[57:01] it'll defeat the devil on every hand
[57:03] come on every circumstance spirit of God
[57:06] coming coming down anointing the word no
[57:09] matter what what it is God can handle it
[57:12] all you got to do is stay behind there
[57:14] don't come from back there now stay back
[57:16] there
[57:17] and watch what God do I said the word
[57:20] the word a handle every situation Wanted
[57:22] let's look at let's look at uh By The
[57:24] Grace God Hebrews 12. God is so good
[57:27] amen overcoming
[57:30] Hebrews 12.
[57:36] Hallelujah I says that we got to
[57:39] overcome
[57:40] but don't don't worry about what you got
[57:42] to overcome
[57:43] just remember how you're gonna overcome
[57:45] it
[57:47] so I asked you tonight how are you gonna
[57:49] overcome it
[57:53] come on
[57:54] you know like I said you don't want to
[57:56] fight but the Bible says many other
[57:58] afflictions are the righteous
[58:00] right
[58:01] but God check on the shall deliver them
[58:04] from some of them right
[58:06] from all of them
[58:08] every one of them
[58:10] didn't have no stipulation nothing it
[58:13] you know God ain't Bound By no
[58:15] restrictions none
[58:17] he says that many are the afflictions
[58:19] are the Righteous but the Lord shall
[58:21] deliver him out of them all
[58:23] come on it's a finished work
[58:26] you in the battle but the battle is
[58:28] already won
[58:29] you already got victory
[58:32] as long as you now now the righteous you
[58:34] got to live right now
[58:35] come on I got to say that you got to
[58:38] live right
[58:39] come on
[58:40] be right with God and remember the
[58:43] battle already won
[58:45] and they always talk about you know
[58:47] Alexander the Great and how I love
[58:50] historical things and and how he always
[58:53] faced the challenge the enemy sometimes
[58:56] was five six times more than what he was
[58:58] but he would push his people he would
[59:01] always tell his army y'all we The
[59:03] Immortals you know we're going to be
[59:06] down in history they used to call
[59:07] themselves Lions going after you know
[59:10] but he would have them so charged up
[59:12] that they would run hedge Steam on in
[59:15] front of in the face of people that was
[59:17] five times they match
[59:19] but yet they would come out with the
[59:21] victory come on now we know he was
[59:23] anointed the taking that age to take
[59:25] over but nevertheless I think I believe
[59:28] that just looking at that I say it's
[59:31] what it is he had more than just a
[59:33] motivation motivational speech but when
[59:36] he spoke it did something to revive the
[59:38] people hallelujah to get them to believe
[59:40] in the impossible and they made the
[59:43] impossible possible by believing in it
[59:45] oh Jesus the other side didn't have that
[59:49] so I say tonight by the grace of God we
[59:52] got so many clouds of witnesses come on
[59:55] I said you got to believe to make the
[59:57] impossible possible
[59:59] he says if you only believe all things
[1:00:02] are possible you got to believe to make
[1:00:04] the impossible possible
[1:00:06] come on
[1:00:08] you're gonna need it one day
[1:00:12] you're gonna need God to be real one day
[1:00:14] you're gonna need more than just church
[1:00:17] one day
[1:00:18] more than just singing and good sermon
[1:00:20] you're gonna need it more than that one
[1:00:22] day
[1:00:23] but you're gonna need
[1:00:24] because we're saying the other other day
[1:00:26] you know people use the the Holy Ghost
[1:00:30] so loosely as a term
[1:00:33] they got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:35] but where's the power
[1:00:37] come on
[1:00:38] he says he gonna he says when you
[1:00:41] receive the Holy Ghost come on
[1:00:43] you shall be Witnesses of me talked
[1:00:45] about enduring you with power
[1:00:47] power come on maybe you say well just
[1:00:51] use it at your own disposal no but when
[1:00:53] the trial comes when the enemy comes in
[1:00:56] like a flood you watch that power
[1:00:59] what is it gonna do Elevate you from
[1:01:02] this carnal realm Elevate you from your
[1:01:05] situation your trial what you're going
[1:01:07] through watch the Power
[1:01:09] when the squeeze come watch the Power
[1:01:12] that's what we want Hallelujah y'all
[1:01:14] believe that tonight come on I say it's
[1:01:17] overcoming come on you know something I
[1:01:20] was looking at here in Hebrews 12. and
[1:01:22] here at the first verse it's saying
[1:01:25] wherefore we are in the first verse
[1:01:27] wherefore scene we also Compass about
[1:01:31] with so great a cloud of witnesses let
[1:01:33] us lay aside every weight and sin which
[1:01:35] does so easily beset us and let us run
[1:01:38] with patience the race that is set
[1:01:39] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[1:01:43] and the finisher of our faith who for
[1:01:45] the joy that was set before him endured
[1:01:47] the cross and despising the shame and is
[1:01:50] set down at the right hand of the Throne
[1:01:53] of God for consider him that door is
[1:01:55] such a contradiction of Sinners against
[1:01:57] himself lest ye be wearied and faint in
[1:02:01] your minds
[1:02:02] I said we're overcoming tonight
[1:02:05] a lot of a lot of that overcoming is
[1:02:08] going to come about what are you looking
[1:02:10] to
[1:02:12] I said we got to look to Jesus
[1:02:14] for every situation every circumstance
[1:02:17] but it's one thing I want to read here
[1:02:18] in the it's an amplified version in the
[1:02:21] 12th verse I just want to read it he
[1:02:23] says the same scripture it says
[1:02:25] therefore then seeing we are surrounded
[1:02:28] by so great a cloud of witnesses who
[1:02:30] have borne testimony to the truth let us
[1:02:34] strip off and throw aside every
[1:02:36] encumbrance unnecessary weight come on
[1:02:41] we got a lot of unnecessary stuff don't
[1:02:43] we
[1:02:44] a lot of things that come on us come on
[1:02:47] our lives and trial situation was
[1:02:49] unnecessary
[1:02:51] carrying around a lot of unnecessary
[1:02:53] weight
[1:02:54] come on he said but let us strip that
[1:02:56] aside throw off everything that's
[1:02:58] unnecessary
[1:02:59] come on
[1:03:01] he says and that sin was so readily
[1:03:04] definitely and clearly clings to an
[1:03:08] inner entangles us and let us run with
[1:03:11] patient endurance and steady and active
[1:03:12] persistence the appointed course of the
[1:03:15] race that is set before us looking away
[1:03:17] and I like how it says here in
[1:03:20] parentheses from all that will distract
[1:03:23] come on when you look into Jesus
[1:03:26] when you're talking about overcoming you
[1:03:28] look into him you got to look away from
[1:03:30] everything that'll distract you
[1:03:33] come on you know bad things happen when
[1:03:35] you get distracted
[1:03:37] I thought about Peter here when he was
[1:03:39] looking at Jesus he was all right wasn't
[1:03:41] he
[1:03:42] the wind and the waves and all that
[1:03:43] stuff was still bolstering it was still
[1:03:45] going on but he didn't see it did it
[1:03:47] because he was looking to Jesus
[1:03:50] but when he got distracted come on when
[1:03:53] he looked away from Jesus what happened
[1:03:55] bad things happen when you get
[1:03:57] distracted
[1:03:58] come on I said God don't distract us I
[1:04:01] mean don't let us be distracted don't
[1:04:03] let us be distracted not now Lord
[1:04:06] not in this hour that we live in
[1:04:08] where things are breaking every day
[1:04:10] happening we don't know what's going to
[1:04:11] happen next Lord don't let us be
[1:04:13] distracted if there's any time we need
[1:04:15] to look to you let us look to you right
[1:04:16] now because any time we want to be
[1:04:18] locked in focused with our mind set on
[1:04:22] our Eternal destination God let it be
[1:04:24] right now and sometimes you got to get
[1:04:27] down on your knees and pray that God
[1:04:29] will stir up something in you come on we
[1:04:31] sang that song take me back to that
[1:04:33] place where I first believed you got to
[1:04:36] pray and ask God to take you back to
[1:04:38] that place the way you first believed
[1:04:40] where you had no distractions when you
[1:04:42] throw it away everything that was
[1:04:44] unnecessary out of your way because you
[1:04:46] didn't want no distractions Hallelujah
[1:04:49] and you made a lot of ground didn't you
[1:04:51] come on he says that here it says
[1:04:55] looking away from all this that will
[1:04:57] distract to Jesus who is the leader and
[1:05:00] the source of our faith given the first
[1:05:03] incentive for our belief and is also its
[1:05:07] finisher bringing it to maturity and
[1:05:09] Perfection he for the joy of obtaining
[1:05:12] the prize that was set before him
[1:05:14] endured the cross despising and ignoring
[1:05:16] the shame and is now seated at the right
[1:05:20] hand of the Throne of God and it says
[1:05:22] here in the third verse just think of
[1:05:24] him who endured from Sinners such
[1:05:27] Grievous opposition and bitter hostility
[1:05:31] against himself wrecking up and
[1:05:34] considering it all
[1:05:36] in comparison with your trials
[1:05:41] he said I want you in Amplified version
[1:05:43] he's just talking here breaking it down
[1:05:44] he says now I want you to think of Jesus
[1:05:48] and all the trials that he'd been
[1:05:50] through
[1:05:50] no the hostility and the things he had
[1:05:53] to face he says I want you to think
[1:05:55] about it reckon it all count it all up
[1:05:57] he says now I want you to compare them
[1:06:00] with your trials
[1:06:02] compare them with what you face with
[1:06:05] Hallelujah
[1:06:06] and see if there's even a comparison
[1:06:09] come on
[1:06:10] he did that he went the distance he made
[1:06:14] the way Hallelujah now he's asking you
[1:06:17] and I to come that way
[1:06:19] but he wouldn't ask you to come that way
[1:06:21] if he wasn't able to take you that way
[1:06:24] he wasn't able to keep you that way he
[1:06:26] wasn't able to bring you all the way he
[1:06:29] wouldn't ask you to come that way would
[1:06:30] he he said so when you think about
[1:06:33] hallelujah what you going through think
[1:06:35] about what he went through and compare
[1:06:37] it to yours
[1:06:39] think about what he gave up and compare
[1:06:41] it to yours think about his suffering
[1:06:43] and the shame the Bible say he ignored
[1:06:46] the shame think about that and compare
[1:06:48] it to your trials
[1:06:49] once you begin to think about that
[1:06:53] then you don't have no struggle going on
[1:06:56] you don't have no struggle because Lord
[1:06:58] hallelujah you went through it you did
[1:07:02] it just for me
[1:07:03] and guard it you asking us to come that
[1:07:06] way and God I'm willing to come that way
[1:07:09] my body might not be willing but I'm
[1:07:12] willing the spirit is willing I'm
[1:07:14] willing to fight I'm willing to go on
[1:07:16] you know a lot of times people did
[1:07:18] things that their body wasn't capable of
[1:07:21] doing but the willingness
[1:07:23] come on they call it adrenaline though
[1:07:26] the willingness brought adrenaline
[1:07:28] things happen they can't explain how it
[1:07:30] happened Hallelujah
[1:07:34] but something was in them that Rush that
[1:07:37] gave them adrenaline to do things that
[1:07:39] were impossible
[1:07:41] to make it through situations through
[1:07:43] trials and all these things that
[1:07:45] everybody else died around them but they
[1:07:47] lived how did you live adrenaline
[1:07:50] that's what they'll say International
[1:07:51] right
[1:07:53] but the same way in the spirit
[1:07:54] Hallelujah people are dying spiritually
[1:07:57] speaking all around you right
[1:08:00] the world is only getting you know was
[1:08:03] in our studying that in this age there
[1:08:06] was nothing good said about this age

[1:08:13] them

[1:08:17] he's doing knocking at the heart of

[1:08:26] sup with him
[1:08:27] come on he that happened here let him
[1:08:30] hear God knocking at the door of your
[1:08:31] hearts

[1:09:09] pushing you
[1:09:10] Hallelujah making you go on a little
[1:09:13] further you know
[1:09:15] the thing is it says
[1:09:17] this world ain't getting no better
[1:09:20] it was nothing good said about this
[1:09:22] world this age
[1:09:24] it's only getting worse and worse and
[1:09:26] worse
[1:09:27] but as the spirit of God gets greater
[1:09:29] than you
[1:09:31] it caused more of a discuss
[1:09:34] it calls you a long and a more to be
[1:09:37] with your heavenly father
[1:09:39] a long and a more to please God come on
[1:09:42] those things aren't appealing to you and
[1:09:45] they don't please you why because you
[1:09:48] have another Spirit how many believe
[1:09:49] that tonight but he says that you know
[1:09:52] here and I like that he says uh in the
[1:09:55] compare them with yours so that you may
[1:09:58] now grow weary
[1:10:00] that you may not grow weary or exalted
[1:10:03] losing heart and relaxing and fainting
[1:10:06] in your Minds come on he says I want you
[1:10:09] to I want you to we're talking about
[1:10:11] overcoming tonight so like I said we're
[1:10:13] in a battle
[1:10:15] spiritual war we're in a fight tonight
[1:10:19] but still yet you know you got to
[1:10:21] overcome How You Gonna overcome you got
[1:10:23] to get in there and fight now
[1:10:25] but not looking at what you got to
[1:10:27] overcome but how you gonna overcome it
[1:10:30] how we being overcoming the Bible says
[1:10:33] you know we should overcome by the blood
[1:10:34] of the Lamb they overcame by the blood
[1:10:37] of lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:10:39] come on how you gonna overcome it it's
[1:10:42] already a finished work but what I'm
[1:10:44] saying you know even in that
[1:10:47] you gotta you gotta get in there and
[1:10:49] fight
[1:10:51] you got to put it all in God's hands I
[1:10:55] can't express that enough
[1:10:57] that God can handle every situation
[1:11:00] yep he can handle every situation
[1:11:04] but we don't give them the situation to
[1:11:05] handle so how can he handle it
[1:11:08] we carry it ourselves we don't give it
[1:11:10] to them how you gonna handle it
[1:11:12] come on but God knows how to handle it
[1:11:14] don't it
[1:11:16] I said overcoming I know I went all over
[1:11:18] myself tonight
[1:11:20] but overcoming you got to overcome come
[1:11:22] on how you gonna overcome tonight
[1:11:24] Paul said in all those things we are
[1:11:26] more than conquerors come on he said I'm
[1:11:28] persuaded it was no situation no trial
[1:11:31] whole world could have fell down on him
[1:11:32] but he knew that he was in God's hand
[1:11:35] and that's what I believe we come into
[1:11:37] even within ourselves
[1:11:39] the whole world crumbled right before
[1:11:41] you your whole world fall down I know
[1:11:43] I'm in God's hands
[1:11:45] because it's something that's been
[1:11:47] converted that the devil can't tamper
[1:11:49] with and that's the soul
[1:11:52] when God comes in there
[1:11:54] you know you ain't worried about all
[1:11:56] those things the devil can't tamper with
[1:11:58] that come on he can't mess with that
[1:12:01] area because God is sitting on the
[1:12:03] throne amen
[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:17] praise God more than conquerors from him
[1:12:19] to love us amen he said this is the
[1:12:21] victory that overcomes the world even

[1:12:26] blood of the lamb and by the word of Our
[1:12:28] Testimony amen so by faith Amen in his
[1:12:32] blood praise God we've overcome amen
[1:12:35] nothing in this world Amen praise God
[1:12:39] can defeat those that have faith in the
[1:12:42] word because the word amen is the
[1:12:45] greatest weapon that God gave us was his
[1:12:48] word
[1:12:48] and that word defeats every demon and
[1:12:51] every devil yes amen the word gives us
[1:12:55] victory
[1:12:56] Amen to praise God the devil is a liar
[1:12:59] and we are more than conquerors through
[1:13:02] him that loved us and because we love
[1:13:06] him
[1:13:07] because we love him
[1:13:10] then we overcome us amen
[1:13:13] praise God because he loved us
[1:13:16] praise God to care enough about us
[1:13:19] condition our hearts and our minds amen
[1:13:22] that we can trust in him
