[43:52] I was just a child
[43:56] &gt;&gt; when I felt the Savior leading.
[44:01] I was drawn to what I could not
[44:06] understand.

[44:38] I realize
[44:40] his grace is what I need.
[44:47] When sin demanded justice
[44:51] for my soul,

[45:23] Life and death stood face to face and
[45:27] darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[45:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[45:38] Mercy said no.
[45:45] For God so loved the world
[45:48] that he sent his son to save us.
[45:53] From the cross he built a bridge to set
[45:58] us free.
[46:01] war. But deep within our hearts,
[46:06] there is still a war that rages
[46:11] and it makes the sacrifice
[46:15] so hard to see.

[46:58] You don't have to be afraid.
[47:03] Mercy said no.
[47:07] Sin will never take control.
[47:11] [Music]
[47:14] Lightning
[47:15] stood face to face.
[47:18] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[47:23] [Music]
[47:26] Thank you Jesus.
[47:29] Mercy said no.
[47:35] [Music]
[47:36] Now when heaven looks at me, it's
[47:40] through the blood of Jesus
[47:45] reminding me of one day long ago.
[47:56] Mercy said no.
[48:00] I'm not going to let you go.
[48:05] I'm not going to let you slip away.
[48:09] You don't have to be afraid.
[48:13] Hey, my go
[48:18] will never take control.
[48:24] Life and death stood face to face and
[48:29] darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[48:36] Thank you Jesus.

[49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; You know, when
[50:00] we think about the mercies and the grace
[50:02] of God,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; God always have somebody there
[50:07] &gt;&gt; to help us alone.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Even as Christians, we've
[50:15] &gt;&gt; come through hard times.
[50:18] But the suffering of this world cannot
[50:20] be compared.
[50:21] [Music]
[50:25] &gt;&gt; And it's such a wonderful thing to be
[50:27] able to
[50:30] have a companion or a friend
[50:34] to walk with you,
[50:37] &gt;&gt; talk with you and commune,
[50:41] &gt;&gt; rebuke you,
[50:44] [Music]
[50:45] &gt;&gt; correct you.
[50:47] You get all of that with friends
[50:51] &gt;&gt; and sometimes some surprises.
[50:56] But you know, it's been
[50:59] an honor. We're going to call our
[51:02] brother Nathan up.
[51:04] [Music]
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen to the mic.
[51:18] It's been
[51:21] 50 years
[51:24] uh for Pastor Henry Simmons
[51:29] &gt;&gt; when the Lord um
[51:32] [Music]
[51:35] told me to put this tuxedo in my
[51:38] wardrobe.
[51:40] I didn't know about this.
[51:46] I thought I was overdoing it and I
[51:49] thought I had it for something else, but
[51:51] it wasn't the will of the Lord.
[51:54] And I am
[51:57] more than happy to
[52:01] do this today.
[52:03] But before I do it anything, I'm going
[52:06] to let
[52:08] brother Nathan go forth
[52:12] and tell us what brother Simmons has
[52:14] meant to him.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan is a warrior, too.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:24] I I I I I love Brother Nathan.
[52:28] Even when we weren't saved, he used to
[52:30] be my boss.
[52:35] paper boys.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Fort Jackson,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget it.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God, who would have
[52:43] known we would be here together?
[52:47] [Music]
[52:48] &gt;&gt; He has been a blessing to me and I know
[52:52] where the inspiration comes from, God.
[52:54] But we know there's always somebody
[52:57] &gt;&gt; that we can thank God for. Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to let brother Nathan go
[53:01] and tell whatever he needs to say.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Thanks.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Honored to be here among the living.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Um,
[53:18] I've been knowing my brother all my
[53:21] life.
[53:27] Me and him slept in the same bed
[53:35] and
[53:37] he been a great
[53:39] instrument to me
[53:43] because I was a real sinner.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, you were.
[53:51] But I can tell you
[53:54] God brought me.
[53:57] [Applause]
[54:00] [Music]
[54:03] &gt;&gt; My brother means so much to me.
[54:08] External God's focal paradox.
[54:12] Incredible yet is true.
[54:15] He been a great example
[54:19] as a brother, as a friend,
[54:25] but I didn't know the Lord. He always
[54:28] came by and check on me,
[54:32] bro. How you doing? I play sleep
[54:37] cuz I didn't want to hear nothing about
[54:39] no Lord.
[54:43] I just just want to have a death here.
[54:45] You know how it is when you really don't
[54:48] want to hear something.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; But he kept coming. He kept praying
[54:54] &gt;&gt; that God would save me.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; He been such a jump in the ministry.
[55:02] When I had to look around,
[55:07] I didn't know too many people that were
[55:09] saved. I know a lot of folk went to
[55:11] church.
[55:13] I know a lot of preachers preach,
[55:17] but I know a lot of them that live it.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; I had a brother and a mother I knew live
[55:24] it.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And that was my turning point right
[55:30] there.
[55:33] You talking about one man influence on
[55:35] another. It was such impact in my life.
[55:40] People who really know me,
[55:44] they know that it's impossible for me to
[55:46] be saved.
[55:50] People who actually know me.
[55:54] But God came along at my lowest point in
[55:57] my darkest hour
[56:00] &gt;&gt; and he saved me.
[56:04] [Applause]
[56:04] [Music]
[56:09] I thank God for pastor Summer. I I had a
[56:12] lot of brothers but was none like that
[56:15] brother.
[56:18] He was an example to my mother.
[56:23] And somebody said, "Why do you have so
[56:25] much confidence?" Not so much him, the
[56:28] God that is in him.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; He cares.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] And
[56:37] if I can say anything
[56:41] that would be I try to be an asset to
[56:44] him and not a liability.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I try not to whatever I could do to help
[56:51] the ministry.
[56:54] I never want to be in the forefront of
[56:56] nothing.
[56:57] [Music]
[56:59] I like to to be behind the scene.
[57:03] And I thank God
[57:06] for my brother and for the work that God
[57:10] allowed him to labor for 50 years.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Labor faithful.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Always had the people not money,
[57:23] no money.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; He gave me his church.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] [Applause]
[57:35] No money.
[57:37] Thank you, Lord.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; No money. He asked me for a dime.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Bro, I'm leaving Mary. I'm
[57:44] coming to Colombia."
[57:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; God sending me to Colombia.
[57:50] I didn't know what to do. I didn't want
[57:53] him to leave
[57:55] cuz I depended so much on him.
[58:00] one day he had to go.
[58:03] And I thank God for these 50 years and
[58:05] continue to bless him, his family, his
[58:09] church family,
[58:11] you that stand with him.
[58:14] We thank God for y'all
[58:17] &gt;&gt; cuz it means so much to him.
[58:21] There someone that will stand strong.
[58:26] That's I'll stand with him.
[58:31] If I can sing, I'mma try.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I'll stand
[58:39] for you,
[58:41] &gt;&gt; dear Jesus.

[58:54] this.

[59:01] good wife. Lord, bless me.
[59:04] [Music]
[59:07] [Applause]
[59:09] The doctor gave me two days to live.
[59:13] I was in the hospital 6 months.
[59:18] I mean, 3 months. God brought me out.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:25] [Music]
[59:27] with that son. I'll stand for you, dear
[59:29] Jesus.
[59:31] You know,
[59:31] &gt;&gt; I'll stand for you.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; You
[59:35] Jesus.

[59:40] may come,
[59:44] &gt;&gt; I'll spread your goel
[59:49] to a fallen
[59:52] name.
[59:54] [Music]

[1:07:37] uh Bishop Simmons because of the part he
[1:07:40] paid played in my life, my ministry, and
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; what God had given unto me.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Uh when it came to evangelism,
[1:07:51] he taught me everything I know.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; And I can remember the time when I
[1:07:56] Hallelujah. I first came this message.
[1:08:01] I even quit my job.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And the churches in this area supported
[1:08:05] me for five years.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Here I was married with babies on the
[1:08:10] way.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; But you know that's the way the church
[1:08:14] supposed to operate.
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; We travel the country
[1:08:21] preaching on streets like in Michigan on
[1:08:24] what was the name of that street?
[1:08:26] Springing Max Street and while we was
[1:08:29] preaching a po a drug bus was going on
[1:08:32] and looked like that big old silver
[1:08:35] pistol was looking right at me.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; But we kept on preaching
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; and then this young lady came up who was
[1:08:44] a victim of this pimp
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; and was on drugs,
[1:08:49] but she wanted to be free. Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you know that man came across the
[1:08:54] street and took her out the line?
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; The saddest thing about that, she was a
[1:09:00] preacher's daughter.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; You see, I want to encourage all the
[1:09:06] young girls, stay in God.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to get married,
[1:09:11] marry a saved man.
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:15] You think it's bad, you think you're
[1:09:18] having a hard time being a Christian,
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; you go out there and be a sinner.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; First of all, you're not going to have
[1:09:25] peace,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; cuz God said, "I'll never leave you, nor
[1:09:28] will I forsake you."
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; But I'm not here to preach. I'm just
[1:09:32] here to testify. See y'all, I got caught
[1:09:34] up.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; But I thank God so much for him. He has
[1:09:40] been more than a friend.
[1:09:43] I I have to say this because I told the
[1:09:46] Lord I would.
[1:09:48] Brother Simmons is has had so many great
[1:09:51] opportunities
[1:09:55] elsewhere,
[1:09:57] but he loves you.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Church is offering him every kind of
[1:10:03] thing.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Gifted.
[1:10:09] I've seen the man I've seen God speak
[1:10:11] directly through him
[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:16] while we were in South Africa
[1:10:20] when we was out there in Texas.
[1:10:24] I remember he was preaching so straight
[1:10:28] it made me nervous
[1:10:31] and I thought these people are going to
[1:10:33] charge us. So me and another brother, we
[1:10:36] were looking at the back of the door
[1:10:39] trying to find a way out.
[1:10:42] But you know what happened? This was an
[1:10:44] apostolic church. They repented.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; All preaching, pastoring, wife, and
[1:10:52] everybody was on the altar.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; We preached in in in South Africa.
[1:10:57] Angels were appearing.
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Power of God was slaying the people.
[1:11:04] I'm just telling you what you got.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; I believe with all my heart and I might
[1:11:09] be the only one,
[1:11:11] but he's not just a a a pastor. He's an
[1:11:14] apostle.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And he built without him, many of the
[1:11:21] churches in this area would not have
[1:11:22] been.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; But one day, I think they're going to
[1:11:26] wake up to what they the gift.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; And I pray that it's not too late.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; He's not a compromiser.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He's straight.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; But one thing I know, he will lead you
[1:11:40] to Christ.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And that's the most important thing.
[1:11:44] Call yourself message, whatever you want
[1:11:46] to call you.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; But I understand many people who call
[1:11:50] themsel that still need to be saved.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; But I just thank the Lord for him in
[1:11:56] such a special special way. And maybe I
[1:12:01] I said I was telling the brothers if I
[1:12:02] ever disrespected him, it was by
[1:12:05] ignorance. No, really.
[1:12:08] Cuz he and I become such friends.
[1:12:10] Sometimes I feel like I can jump in at
[1:12:12] any time.
[1:12:14] But I don't intend to disrespect him at
[1:12:17] all. But I love the man with a great
[1:12:19] godly love. And ever what I've never
[1:12:23] seen him out of order. everywhere we
[1:12:26] went with his discernment and the things
[1:12:30] that God has gifted him with kept us
[1:12:32] straight.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; So I I just love and appreciate him. 50
[1:12:37] years
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; and he's never wavered.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; thank you for your mercies. Thank you
[1:20:27] for your grace.

[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Who the son of man has set free is free
[1:20:36] indeed.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; It's our God-given right to worship you

[1:21:18] take us into where you would want us to

[1:21:24] Jesus and him glorified amongst us. Be
[1:21:27] exalted be lifted up. Bless the host
[1:21:31] pastor brother Simmons in a special way.
[1:21:33] His dear wife and family and the entire
[1:21:36] congregation here. Every visitor, every
[1:21:40] minister that supported. Lord, we know
[1:21:42] it's all your love and your grace
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; expressed in this end time as we prepare
[1:21:48] for your glorious coming. Oh, dress us
[1:21:51] with your clothes of your word as we
[1:21:53] wait upon thee. In the name of Jesus
[1:21:55] Christ, we pray. May we all say amen
[1:21:58] this morning.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Let's give the Lord a
[1:22:02] note of praise.
[1:22:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:08] Glory be to God in the highest. Would
[1:22:12] you just greet someone next to you and
[1:22:14] say, "Welcome to the house of the Lord,
[1:22:15] brother. Welcome, sister.
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:42] Hallelujah.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:45] So, while we are standing, I'll just
[1:22:47] like to take a portion of scripture
[1:22:49] reading. If we can turn in our Bibles,
[1:22:52] we'll read from Job chapter 42.
[1:23:03] Just one verse
[1:23:10] I have heard. Verse five,
[1:23:13] I have heard of thee by the hearing of
[1:23:16] the air, but now mine eye seeth thee.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:23:23] word. We may be seated.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:28] How many love the Lord Jesus?
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; He has made us glad.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To God we give the glory.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; To God we give all the praise. He is the
[1:23:39] worthy one.
[1:23:41] We thank God for
[1:23:44] being with you all here today.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; My first time in South Carolina. And um
[1:23:49] it has certainly been a tremendous
[1:23:52] blessing to be here with you all to
[1:23:55] enjoy worshiping the Lord with you all.
[1:23:58] And
[1:23:59] uh you know, brother Simmons
[1:24:02] has been with us back in Trinidad
[1:24:05] for quite a few times together with
[1:24:07] brother Isaiah Brooks and um they have
[1:24:10] certainly been a blessing to us over in
[1:24:12] Trinidad and all the messages, all the
[1:24:16] songs and so they their names are famous
[1:24:19] in Trinidad.
[1:24:21] And um the last time brother Simmons
[1:24:23] came, I believe he came with his son,
[1:24:25] brother Caleb. and um they sang in our
[1:24:29] church and you know to see brother Caleb
[1:24:31] now bringing forth the word of God
[1:24:33] yesterday and we certainly enjoy the
[1:24:35] message and it's a tremendous blessing
[1:24:39] to see that God could raise up young men
[1:24:42] uh with the gospel to hold the sword of
[1:24:44] the word and drive it to the heart of
[1:24:47] the enemy. Brother, that's a tremendous
[1:24:49] blessing and brother I pray that you
[1:24:51] will continue supporting him and uh uh
[1:24:55] it was a pleasure to meet brother Joshua
[1:24:57] and the entire family of brother Simmons
[1:25:00] is dear wife and daughter and it's it's
[1:25:06] it was a privilege to me to
[1:25:09] see the operation in the tent and the
[1:25:12] support and the vision that brother
[1:25:15] Simmons had to reach out to the last
[1:25:18] member because we are all waiting until
[1:25:21] the last member comes in.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; And when the fold is full,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; we will leave here.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; The good shepherd leaves the 90 and nine
[1:25:30] and he goes out for that last one.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And when the f is full, then we leave
[1:25:36] here.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; So we cannot leave until the last member
[1:25:39] comes in.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, so it's important for us
[1:25:42] to continue reaching out, reaching out
[1:25:45] and by that time, God will be building
[1:25:47] what he has on the inside. And we are
[1:25:49] all coming up to a statue of a perfect
[1:25:51] man.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Unto the fullness of the image of
[1:25:55] Christ.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; A people that the world never saw
[1:25:58] before.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is Christ embodied in
[1:26:02] flesh.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; One more time. A people that the word,
[1:26:05] the letters have left the Bible and it
[1:26:08] have embodied flesh. And this is who we
[1:26:10] are here in this hour.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not just church
[1:26:13] goers,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; brother. We are Bible believers.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; We are the ones that are called to eat
[1:26:18] this book
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; and the words here become a reality in
[1:26:21] our lives.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Where we could become Christ expressed
[1:26:26] to this last generation.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; So it was wonderful seeing the efforts
[1:26:30] that went into it and all the different
[1:26:32] brothers and brother Gyra there a
[1:26:34] wonderful soldier supporting. Every time
[1:26:37] I see him, he's working. And may God
[1:26:39] bless him abundantly for all his labors
[1:26:42] of love. And you know, I appreciated
[1:26:44] Brother Simmons even more this time uh
[1:26:48] coming here. And when he came, I believe
[1:26:51] it was back in 2018. You know, Brother
[1:26:53] Simmons always walk with his cards and
[1:26:56] anywhere anyone he would reach, he would
[1:26:59] extend an invitation to you. And uh when
[1:27:02] he came to Trinidad, you all understand
[1:27:04] my accent?
[1:27:06] All right. It may be a bit difficult,
[1:27:08] but may God give us grace this morning.
[1:27:12] When he came to Trinidad, um he gave me
[1:27:14] one of his cards. I believe that would
[1:27:15] have been in 2018. And he told me that
[1:27:18] anytime I'm on this side, be sure to
[1:27:20] visit him. And um well, it was never God
[1:27:26] never placed it as a burning to be here.
[1:27:31] And I've visited the States a few times
[1:27:33] since then, but never here. And um
[1:27:37] recently he called me again and he told
[1:27:39] me about these meetings that they were
[1:27:41] going to have and he invited me to come
[1:27:43] and and the Lord placed it upon my heart
[1:27:45] to be here. And uh when he came the
[1:27:48] previous time in 2018 uh the Lord just
[1:27:52] placed a little thought on my heart on
[1:27:55] eyewitnesses
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; and he said if ever you go by brother
[1:28:00] Simmons preach this. And here I am after
[1:28:03] 7 years and I believe that God has
[1:28:06] something in this little thought for us
[1:28:07] this morning. I pray it be a blessing to
[1:28:09] our hearts.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; So we
[1:28:15] are all called here in the word of God.
[1:28:19] You know Peter spoke about it that we
[1:28:21] have not followed connly devised fables.
[1:28:24] So my little thought this morning is
[1:28:25] eyewitnesses.
[1:28:27] And a an eyewitness is someone very
[1:28:31] important because uh you know you see
[1:28:34] things that sometimes you are
[1:28:36] accountable for
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; and many times you see things that
[1:28:40] others would not see
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; and it's important for us to understand
[1:28:46] what we are seeing.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest. And
[1:28:52] almighty God has called us all to be
[1:28:55] eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; All right. We must understand we are
[1:29:01] supernatural beings trapped in a body of
[1:29:04] time.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; We believe that
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; we are not from here.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; I'm from Trinidad. My brother is from
[1:29:12] Zambia. Brother Jimmy and we have some
[1:29:14] of us from America. And but we are not
[1:29:16] from here.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; We came from eternity.
[1:29:22] And we are going back
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; to eternity.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; We are just on a journey here in time.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; This is the shortest period of time you
[1:29:30] will ever live is now.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Because when we enter eternity, there is
[1:29:35] no tomorrow. There's no yesterday.
[1:29:38] There's a everpresent.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; It's a It's a circle. It never There's
[1:29:42] never an end.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We live We will live for
[1:29:46] ages.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; With the one that died for us. Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; There was someone that thought of all
[1:29:52] this and this is what we know as the
[1:29:54] great redemption plan. It was a plan
[1:29:58] that God had in his mind that he could
[1:30:00] reveal himself to man one more time and
[1:30:03] take man back
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; to the original condition to live
[1:30:07] forever with him.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And he has called us to be part of that.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; So we are not
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; normal Americans.
[1:30:18] Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We refer to ourselves as
[1:30:22] being the bride of Christ.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; We are called to be different.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are called to see things
[1:30:28] that the world never saw before.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; We are a a special class of people.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; And you would notice God in the
[1:30:38] beginning in the garden of Eden, God
[1:30:41] gave Adam the power to create.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; We know Adam could have controlled the
[1:30:46] winds. Yeah,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; he named the animals.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Adam arranged the garden. God
[1:30:53] placed him to dress the garden. And Adam
[1:30:55] did not dress the garden with bulldozers
[1:30:57] and excavators. He dressed the garden
[1:31:00] with the spoken word.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Adam said mountain move and the mountain
[1:31:07] moved.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said trees moved and the
[1:31:10] trees moved.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; If the wind was too hard, brother, he
[1:31:14] could say lower.
[1:31:16] He controlled the temperature in the
[1:31:18] garden of Eden.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; We believe that.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; That's where we fell from.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; But that's where we are going back to.
[1:31:25] Hallelujah.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And in the garden of Eden, Adam with all
[1:31:32] that authority and power,
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; yet God in the cool of the day
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; would condescend
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; and speak with Adam. Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; What sort of a fellowship that would
[1:31:45] have been?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; A man that had all power.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He had all authority.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; But yet God was above that.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And God will choose the cool of the day
[1:31:57] to condescend and fellowship with him.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Glory. That same God wants to fellowship
[1:32:04] with us even today.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; It's that same God is speaking to us.
[1:32:09] What would that fellowship have been?
[1:32:11] So, what I'm saying is that God loves
[1:32:14] fellowship.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; God loves to reveal himself to us.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; God wants more of us.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; And even though Adam had the whole day
[1:32:22] for himself, God wants a part of us.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; He is incomplete without us.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; We give him a reason of being.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Don't you know God is an object of
[1:32:34] worship?
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; God deserves worship. Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; That is why he said, "Thou shalt have no
[1:32:39] other god besides me."
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; So, Adam was the first eyewitness.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; To witness the descent of almighty God
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; to witness the presence of God.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; He the scripture said he saw he heard
[1:32:57] the voice of the Lord walking in the
[1:32:59] cool of the day.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; He saw the voice walking,
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; right? So any one of us could see a
[1:33:06] voice.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; You don't see a voice walking. But Adam
[1:33:10] saw the voice of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; So God has called us here in this
[1:33:16] generation to a deeper fellowship to see
[1:33:19] things that the world never saw.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And Jesus told Nicodemus, except a man
[1:33:26] be born again,
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; he cannot
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; see
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of heaven.
[1:33:33] Good stuff.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; So this kingdom is beyond physical
[1:33:38] eyesight.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; We could have 2020 vision, but we miss
[1:33:41] it.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; So God is calling us to something
[1:33:45] higher.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; He's calling us to a new birth.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; A man must be born again.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Without that birth, we cannot see God.
[1:33:59] Amen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; To see what Adam saw, we must be born
[1:34:02] again.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Seven generations down from Adam, we had
[1:34:09] a brother called Enoch.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; He was a witness also.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Is it because uh Hebrews chapter 11 gave
[1:34:18] us some witnesses.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then chapter 12, he
[1:34:22] started off saying, "Seeing therefore,
[1:34:24] brethren, we are compass with so great a
[1:34:27] cloud of witnesses.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Let us lay aside every weight
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; and the sin which that so easily beset
[1:34:33] us, and let us
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; run,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; run with."
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; How could you run with P? You are
[1:34:43] running.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; When you are running, you are going
[1:34:45] fast. But he said run with patience.
[1:34:49] Hallelujah.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And the prophet always taught us that
[1:34:54] the first person you must have patience
[1:34:56] with is
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Many times we cannot wait on God but
[1:35:05] this race we run with patience. Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; So, cloud of witnesses, we heard about a
[1:35:13] witness called
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Enoch.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And Enoch lived seven generations down
[1:35:19] from Adam. He was the seventh from Adam.
[1:35:21] And seven is a number of completion.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; We are living in a seventh age now
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; and this is the end of all time.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Enoch was a man that the
[1:35:31] scripture said he walked with God till
[1:35:33] he was not.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; For God took him. He was translated
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; a man that had a relationship with God
[1:35:41] and he would talk with God and
[1:35:42] communicate with God until one day the
[1:35:45] fellowship was so sweet
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; that he didn't decide to go back home.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; He just continued walking with God.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Would you want a walk with like that?
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Would you like a walk like that
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; where we leave the things of this world
[1:36:01] behind? Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; fresh man, brother.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Your job cannot be more important than
[1:36:09] God.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb showed us that yesterday.
[1:36:13] Once God calls us, he calls us to give
[1:36:15] up something.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; So the things of this world cannot hold
[1:36:19] us down.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; So Enoch walked with God till he was
[1:36:22] not. But he had a testimony that he
[1:36:24] pleased God.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Enoch built the pyramids.
[1:36:35] something that is still standing today.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; The first man that hit the first ratio,
[1:36:40] he was translated
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; was a man that built a statue.
[1:36:43] Hallelujah. That is still standing
[1:36:45] today. And there is a bride that will
[1:36:47] hit a statue.
[1:36:50] Was it
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; brother
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Isaiah I believe was saying this picture
[1:36:56] we have in the church of the statue. Was
[1:36:57] it you, brother? One day that has to
[1:36:59] come off the wall.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; You have Peter told us of a statue of a
[1:37:03] perfect man, wasn't it?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; And love is the capstone.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; But one day that statue of a perfect
[1:37:08] man, that nature has to come off the
[1:37:10] wall. We are that people.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Don't you know you are the new
[1:37:15] Jerusalem.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; John saw a city coming down as a bride
[1:37:21] adorned for a husband. Who is that?
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; You are that city. He said, "I'll write
[1:37:29] upon you the name of the city of my
[1:37:31] God."
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus told you, I go to prepare a place
[1:37:36] for you,
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; that where I am,
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; there you will be also.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; So at this moment, Jesus is preparing a
[1:37:43] city for us.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; And while he's preparing a physical
[1:37:47] city, he's preparing a city, a bride
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; that will come to pyramid perfection.
[1:37:53] Hallelujah.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Different from the rest.
[1:37:56] Hallelujah.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; A bride with his character,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; his works.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; His signs, his wonders,
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; his word.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; This is who you are.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; You are different from the rest.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; You are called to be different.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; So Enoch made that and he was a witness.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; He saw the glory of God.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; He encountered a body change. Yeah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; What I want to say,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; God has called us to see things the
[1:38:29] world never saw.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; If we should die now, where do we go?
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "If this earthly house be
[1:38:41] dissolved,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; we have
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; a body
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; eternal
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; in the heavens, made without hands." So
[1:38:52] it doesn't have a neighbor string
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; it made without hands
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; that is waiting for us
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; that if we die now we slip into that
[1:39:02] dimension
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; that body is here
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; don't get frightened
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; this is not ghost
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; this is a reality
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; that is why when they put the ball to
[1:39:20] cut off his head and Paul watched death.
[1:39:24] He said, "Oh de,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; where is thy sting?
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Grave, where is thy victory?"
[1:39:30] Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] Paul knew that if this be dissolved,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; he had a body waiting for him
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; to enter into that dimension.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; So that is why today we watch cancer.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; We laugh.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:39:48] We have a body
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; that cancer cannot affect.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; We have a body that cataract cannot
[1:39:55] affect.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; In that body, we know all things.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; In that body, there's no sickness. In
[1:40:02] that body, there's no pain.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that body is waiting on
[1:40:06] us.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; And that body is right here.
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] [Applause]
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; That body is here. Amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; And when you recognize this word
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; to be the word
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; and you receive a new birth,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; we are taught you receive charges
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; from that realm,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; that body receive a charge and it
[1:40:33] charges this body.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you are born again and you
[1:40:39] enter in this kind of an atmosphere,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; what we received last night,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; what we received yesterday in the young
[1:40:45] people meeting and the anointing would
[1:40:47] drop down, it's the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:40:49] you responding to that body.
[1:40:57] Amen.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; You heard from your theophony.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; When you recognize this word to be the
[1:41:03] word
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; and it gives you a charge. When that
[1:41:07] charges you, sickness cannot stay.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; You cannot remain in your condition.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; There is a real realm that we cannot
[1:41:22] see. Our eyes are veiled to it. Oh, this
[1:41:25] is why Elijah when he prayed, he said,
[1:41:27] "Lord, open the boy's eyes."
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; And when his eyes were open, he saw the
[1:41:31] supernatural horse all around.
[1:41:35] There's a next dimension that is more
[1:41:37] real than this dimension that is right
[1:41:39] here.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; that if we could tap into it,
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; our resources are unlimited.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:41:54] It's available for you.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Did men see
[1:42:06] Did we have any eyewitnesses
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; of people that saw people from another
[1:42:11] dimension?
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Were there any eyewitnesses in the
[1:42:16] scripture?
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. We had a brother called
[1:42:23] Abraham.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham was called at the old age.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; He was called friend of God.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; And God called him out of idol worship
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; to be a son of God.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; No matter where you are and what
[1:42:41] condition you are in the seed of God
[1:42:44] just comes out when God calls
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; the people around you. Abraham tried to
[1:42:49] carry Lot, his
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; nephew.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; He cried his father,
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; but they were not in the call.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; And as long as you fully separate, God
[1:43:00] cannot bless you.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; And Lot and Abraham started to have
[1:43:04] contention.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; We know the story.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; We know the Bible. And what happened?
[1:43:10] Abraham say, "Separate.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Separate.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; You choose."
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And wherever you choose,
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I will go the opposite direction. And
[1:43:17] the scripture say Lot lifted up his eyes
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; and he saw the plains of Sodom
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; as the garden of the Lord
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; and Lot made a decision to choose Sodom.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; We know what Sodom is.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; We know what Sodom is.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; We living in a sodom sodomic age at this
[1:43:37] stage.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And Lord chose that for his family.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And he gave Abraham the hideway. But
[1:43:45] sometimes the higher way is God's way.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you get the second choice. You
[1:43:52] didn't get the first choice. But that is
[1:43:54] God's choice.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; And Abraham went on the highway. But God
[1:43:59] tell Abraham, "Lift up now thine eyes.
[1:44:01] Look to the east, north, south.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; All that you see is yours."
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; That is chapter 13. Chapter 14. You know
[1:44:12] what happened?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lot end up in trouble
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; down in Sodom and there was an invasion
[1:44:19] of kings down in Sodom and Lot was taken
[1:44:22] captive.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; And a message came back to Abraham Lot
[1:44:29] is captive.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about eyewitnesses tonight.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Look at the condition under which
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Abraham will break dimensions
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; and see beings from another
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; realm. Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Under which conditions?
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; And Abraham armed his trained servants
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and he went to deliver Lot.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Now saints, this is important for us. We
[1:44:55] cannot love those who treat us good
[1:44:57] alone.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Lot gave Abraham the hideway.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; And when he ended up in trouble, Abraham
[1:45:09] went after him.
[1:45:12] Hallelujah.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Are we willing to go after the ones that
[1:45:15] mistreat us?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Are we willing?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham went after him.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And he recovered all
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; and on the way returning.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; On his way back,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; what happened? A dimension opened.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] And a king from a city
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; called Salem,
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; the city of the most high God,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; a king stepped forth
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and he met Abraham.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; And the scripture said he fed him bread
[1:45:52] and wine.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; They had a communion.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; So that means there were the Paul shows
[1:45:59] Abraham search for a city whose builder
[1:46:01] and maker is God.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Abraham was living, things were
[1:46:06] hard, but he was looking for a city
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; and he found the king of that city and
[1:46:11] the exact spot where that city would be.
[1:46:13] Abraham walked on that spot.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; And the God of that city broke
[1:46:19] dimensions
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; from the seventh dimension and entered
[1:46:23] into a third dimension where Abraham
[1:46:26] could see him
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; and he fed him bread and wine.
[1:46:32] Abraham was an eyewitness of the majesty
[1:46:34] of God.
[1:46:37] [Applause]
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; When he lived out brotherly kindness,
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; when we live for others,
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; we would see the glory of God.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; We love the Lord.
[1:46:58] [Applause]
[1:47:05] Chapter 22, some chapters down, God gave
[1:47:09] Abraham a test.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; He said, Abraham,
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; come up to the mountain and sacrifice
[1:47:15] your son
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; on one of the mountains. I will tell you
[1:47:19] of.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; This test was so hard he couldn't even
[1:47:21] tell Sarah.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; She wouldn't have allowed that. And
[1:47:26] sometimes God call us to make decisions
[1:47:29] that we cannot let the right hand know
[1:47:30] what the left hand is doing.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; But we just have to follow the leading
[1:47:34] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And Abraham went up to the mountain
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; and he told the young men with him.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Isaac and I, we are going up to worship
[1:47:45] the Lord and return.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Eyewitnesses of the glory of God.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was going to sacrifice his
[1:47:57] son.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; But the faith that he had,
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; a God that gave me, hallelujah,
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; this boy,
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; as a old man,
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; because we remember Abraham met
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Melchzdc in chapter 14.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; In chapter 18, he met Elohim. Amen.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; God himself, brother, took some
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; the 16 elements
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; elements from
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; a body
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; and descended in a body.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Not a theophony now because aphony you
[1:48:28] don't eat in that body.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; But it was God in flesh.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Came and he ate steak.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; He drank milk.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he discerned the
[1:48:40] thoughts of Abraham's heart.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He discerned the thoughts of Sarah's
[1:48:43] heart. Abraham
[1:48:46] [Applause]
[1:48:47] was an eyewitness
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; and God is calling us
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; to be eyewitnesses of his majesty
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; to see things the world never saw
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; to break dimensions
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; witness
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Abraham had an experience with God
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; chapter 22
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; when he went on that mountain. Isaac
[1:49:14] asked him, he said, "But daddy, I'm
[1:49:16] seeing
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; the wood."
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "Everything is prepared for the
[1:49:23] sacrifice.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; But then where is the sacrifice?
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Where is the lamb?"
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Abraham, hallelujah, brother. With tears
[1:49:33] from his eyes,
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; brother responded.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "My son,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; God shall provide for himself a
[1:49:40] sacrifice."
[1:49:42] And sometimes God is calling you into
[1:49:44] service. You don't know where the money
[1:49:45] coming from. You don't know where the
[1:49:47] support coming from. But God will
[1:49:49] provide himself a sacrifice.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The doctors say there is
[1:49:54] nothing could be done for you, brother.
[1:49:56] There's no more hope for you, but God
[1:49:58] will provide himself a sacrifice.
[1:50:01] Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And on that mountain
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; as Abraham was coming down with a knife,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; we know the story.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; God called from heaven, he
[1:50:14] said,"Abraham, Abraham,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; lay not thy hands upon the Lord." He
[1:50:19] said, "For now I know that thou lovest
[1:50:23] me."
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Are we will Are we Do we love the Lord
[1:50:30] more than our families?
[1:50:32] [Applause]
[1:50:35] God is first.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; God's people is second,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; our families is third,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; and we are last.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; That is the order of serving God.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; We must never put our families before
[1:50:49] God.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Now I know thou
[1:50:54] lovest me." And in the distance right
[1:50:57] here, you blew, what was it?
[1:51:02] A ram caught any tickets.
[1:51:05] [Applause]
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; God provided a lamb for Abraham.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; A lamb was created.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Is he still the creator?
[1:51:18] [Applause]
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; There's a God in our generation that
[1:51:23] created skills.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; We saw we heard from sister Hannah. He
[1:51:27] created fires.
[1:51:29] What she didn't have, he could stretch
[1:51:31] God.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I want God is still your creator.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever your situation is, he has
[1:51:47] called us to be eyewitnesses
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; of his majesty.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:58] Jesus stood
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; one day.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Some of you standing here
[1:52:05] would not see death
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; until they see the Lord's Christ,
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; until they see the glory of the kingdom,
[1:52:12] the son of man coming in his kingdom, in
[1:52:13] his glory."
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; And then we saw he took Peter, James,
[1:52:20] and John
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; and he took them up onto a mount
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; and something took place.
[1:52:31] His body was changed.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; His reignment was changed.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; It shine as the sun
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; in all its glory.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; And here it was. Men that were missing
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; that the CIA couldn't find
[1:52:49] [Applause]
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; appeared on the scene.
[1:52:55] and Peter, James, and John, faith, hope,
[1:52:57] and charity.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; They knew exactly who they were.
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Here was Moses.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Here was Elijah, a man that was caught
[1:53:08] up in a chariot of fire.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And Elisha, his servant, saw that.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; He was a witness.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; He saw chariots of fire.
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:23] Saints, when difficulty come our ways,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; it's God allowing it to show us his
[1:53:28] majesty.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; May God open your eyes of faith
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; to believe for what you can see.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:53:38] for.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; The evidence of things not seen.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; So don't wait to see it.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Do not wait to see it.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Declare it.
[1:53:49] Speak it and it shall be.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:58] [Applause]
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; This is why I read the story with Job.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Job said, "I've heard of thee
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; by the hearing of the air." Yes,
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Job went through many trials.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; But at the end of all those trials,
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; he was God,
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; but he came down.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And a whirlwind.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; He spoke to Job and he sent Eliho, a
[1:54:28] young man
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; to declare the glory of God.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; And at the end of that visitation is
[1:54:35] when
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Job could have said,
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; "I know.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; I know. Yes.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Not someone tell me
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; or the pastor said, but I know
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; and the revelation must move from the
[1:54:47] pastor.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; From the Bible
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; to become a personal revelation to you
[1:54:52] that I know. Hallelujah.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; That my redeemer liveth.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; And even though skin worms destroy this
[1:55:02] body, yet in this flesh,
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; I'll see him.
[1:55:07] Amen.
[1:55:10] Hallelujah.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Job was an eyewitness.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; At the end of all his trials,
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; he saw God.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; could it be that God allowed all this in
[1:55:21] our lives?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; That we could be eyewitnesses.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; that is why Paul taught us, run this
[1:55:28] race with patience.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; One day, the wheelchair wouldn't be able
[1:55:35] to hold us. Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; One day we wouldn't need glasses.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; One day the crutches wouldn't be able to
[1:55:42] hold us. Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; He's allowing this that his glory could
[1:55:47] be made manifest in our lives.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Let's close.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; We saw these men on the mountain.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:56:00] died.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; And hundreds of years after his death,
[1:56:04] here it is. He's standing on Mount
[1:56:06] Transfiguration.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; A dead man living.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; But we are promised
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; that the dead in Christ
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; shall
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; righteous.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; So we are looking for a change.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Paul told us that the dead in Christ
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; shall rise first. Right?
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; So we are going to see
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; dead people coming back to life.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; It happened already
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament. Brother, when the
[1:56:45] veil was rent and Jesus gave up the
[1:56:47] ghost, the veil in the temple was rent
[1:56:49] from top to bottom, the glory of God
[1:56:51] came out and the rocks the earth rent
[1:56:53] and the graves were open.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; And the scripture said they visited the
[1:56:58] believers.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; They visited the brethren. So your house
[1:57:02] must be always ready
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; for a visitation from the
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; from the sixth dimension
[1:57:16] [Applause]
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; what if they come in our homes and the
[1:57:20] type of music we are playing
[1:57:23] [Applause]
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; we understand
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; it's how we love the Lord.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; So the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; And then we which are alive and remain,
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; what going to happen with us?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; We shall be changed.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cancer cannot hold us down.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Diabetes whatever it is,
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; these bodies will be changed.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you. And that body that theophonic
[1:57:58] body
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; brother inhabits this body
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; and it's going to make a glorified body
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; because in our theophony we don't eat.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; The saints beyond the curtain of time
[1:58:10] they don't eat.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; They don't sleep.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; All right. So they're longing to come
[1:58:14] back here
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; and we longing to go there.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; They want to be where we are and we want
[1:58:21] to leave this house.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:58:25] One day these eyes shall see him.
[1:58:27] Hallelujah.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; We shall be changed
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; in the moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:58:33] eye,
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; at the last trump.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; So here was Elijah, a type of us
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; that will be quickened.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Those that would not see that. And
[1:58:43] there's the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:58:44] midst of it all.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; That is where this great union is taking
[1:58:49] place. Amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; We got to understand saints,
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; our relationship with this word is
[1:58:56] important.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; When Jesus died,
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; he went into his theophony.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; He went into a body. And the scripture
[1:59:06] showed he preached to the souls that
[1:59:08] were in prison.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; For him to preach, he wasn't a spirit.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; He was a body.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And there were people in that fifth
[1:59:15] dimension, that is where the ungodly
[1:59:17] goes when they die. In the sixth
[1:59:19] dimension, you have the believers go and
[1:59:21] God is in the seventh.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; We live in a three-dimensional world and
[1:59:24] the fourth dimension is technology.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; All right? So, technology is passing
[1:59:30] here
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; right now, but our eyes can see it.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; But there are things on our cell phone
[1:59:35] can pick it up.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; They know. Hallelujah.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Our cell phone is not smarter than us.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Brother, we have an ability to connect
[1:59:42] with the seven dimension. We have an
[1:59:44] ability to connect with God
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; and charges from that dimension could
[1:59:48] come down to this dimension.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; That is where your healing is.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; That is where your healing is.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; So we love the Lord.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:03] When Jesus died, he entered into a body,
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; but he had a limited time
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; because the scripture said
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; that body cannot see corruption.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; So he had to visit hell
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; and then he had to visit now the
[2:00:23] brothers that were trapped in paradise.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Enoch saw him as the wheel in the middle
[2:00:27] of the wheel.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Daniel saw him as the stone
[2:00:30] cut without hands.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; That is our Lord.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; This was the one that Job said, "I know
[2:00:35] my redeemer liveth."
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; He had to visit Job
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; and all those believers
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; and then ascend
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; by Sunday morning.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; He had to be out of that dimension
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; back into this dimension. So here was
[2:00:52] Jesus in his theophony watching the body
[2:00:55] that they pierced
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; watching the body that they place crown
[2:00:59] of thorns on in a tomb.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; And you know just now this will enter
[2:01:04] back into that
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; and I will ascend.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Although the the rock is there, the rock
[2:01:10] cannot hold that. Amen.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Wherever we die, however we die, and
[2:01:18] however long we are gone, when that time
[2:01:20] comes,
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; death have to give up.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; God is still able to create.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; And these bodies, your form, God took a
[2:01:29] pity of you when you were at your best.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the big belly and
[2:01:36] your theophony. There's no big belly.
[2:01:41] or or or whatever we don't like about
[2:01:43] ourselves.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; That body is perfect.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; That body is the best you could ever be
[2:01:51] at.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; We love the Lord.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to come back and pick up that
[2:02:00] body. So what I'm saying, there is a
[2:02:02] real realm beyond what we could see. And
[2:02:05] God is trying to sensitize us to that
[2:02:08] realm because one day, brother, we are
[2:02:10] to break dimensions out of this realm
[2:02:13] into that realm.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; A body change is awaiting us. And this
[2:02:17] is where God is calling us now to be
[2:02:19] eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; The message is moving beyond words and
[2:02:25] is becoming flesh.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; God is calling us for a change. We love
[2:02:34] the Lord Jesus this morning.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I don't want to take much more time. May
[2:02:37] we all stand by God's grace as we have
[2:02:40] brother Jimmy to come. Hallelujah.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[2:02:49] Praise God. It's okay. It's okay. God
[2:02:51] bless you all. As you're standing, I was
[2:02:55] wondering what will I say when they he's
[2:02:58] preaching. I don't know what he's going
[2:02:59] to preach and what he's going to be and
[2:03:02] what will I say but uh I I see it
[2:03:05] connecting. We're going to read Isaiah
[2:03:07] Isaiah 6. Amen. Isaiah 6 and and and I
[2:03:12] I'll give it a seminate like just build
[2:03:14] up from where he's is is he's is left.
[2:03:16] Amen. So that we have a good time in the
[2:03:19] Lord. Amen. Isaiah 6 says, "In the year
[2:03:23] that King Oziah died, I saw also the
[2:03:27] Lord sitting upon a throne, iron lifted
[2:03:32] up and the train filled his temple."
[2:03:35] Praise God. Isaiah was a witness. My my
[2:03:39] my hallelujah. He says, "Above it stood
[2:03:43] the seraphims and each one had six
[2:03:45] wings. Uh with train he covered his face
[2:03:48] and with train he covers his feet and
[2:03:51] with train he did fly and one cried unto
[2:03:55] the other and say holy holy holy is the
[2:03:59] Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full
[2:04:01] of his glory and the post of the door
[2:04:04] moved at the voice of him that cried and
[2:04:07] the house was filled with smoke. Then
[2:04:09] said I, "Woe is me, for I'm undone,
[2:04:13] because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I
[2:04:15] dwell in the midst of a people of
[2:04:17] unclean lips, for the mine eyes have
[2:04:20] seen the king, the Lord of hosts." Then
[2:04:23] flew one of the seraraphims unto me,
[2:04:25] having a life coal in his hand, which he
[2:04:28] had taken with the tongues from off the
[2:04:32] altar, and laid it upon my mouth, and
[2:04:35] said, "Lo, this has touched thy lips.
[2:04:38] Thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[2:04:42] is purged. Also I heard a voice from the
[2:04:45] Lord saying whom shall I send? Who will
[2:04:48] go for us? Then said I here am I. Send
[2:04:52] me. Hallelujah.
[2:04:54] Praise God. My my my my. While we still
[2:04:58] standing, let's also read uh uh
[2:05:01] Ephesians 2:56 5 and 6. It says even we
[2:05:06] we were dead and sins hath uh uh he
[2:05:09] quickened us together with Christ. By
[2:05:12] grace ye are saved and hath raised up uh
[2:05:16] us up together and made us sit in
[2:05:20] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Praise
[2:05:24] God. Amen. We are true witnesses. Amen.
[2:05:27] Praise God. Hebrews uh uh uh uh 10
[2:05:31] Hebrews 10:16-22
[2:05:34] also says, "This is the covenant that I
[2:05:37] will make with them after those days,
[2:05:40] sayeth the Lord. I will put my laws in
[2:05:42] their hearts and in their minds will I
[2:05:45] write them, and their sins and iniquity
[2:05:47] will I remember no more." And now uh uh
[2:05:52] where where remission of these is, there
[2:05:54] is no more offering for sin. Having
[2:05:58] therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
[2:06:01] the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a
[2:06:05] new and living way, which he hath
[2:06:08] consecrated for us through the veil,
[2:06:11] that is to say, his flesh, and having an
[2:06:14] high priest uh over the house of God,
[2:06:17] let us draw near with a true heart. We
[2:06:21] are invited to become witnesses. Amen.
[2:06:24] in in and full assurance of faith having
[2:06:27] our hearts sprinkled from evil
[2:06:30] conscience and our bodies washed with
[2:06:32] pure water. Praise God. And my little
[2:06:35] title just to add to what the brother is
[2:06:37] saying is in his presence.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; That is our little title. We are called
[2:06:43] to come in his presence to be true
[2:06:46] witnesses. Hallelujah. In his presence.
[2:06:51] Hallelujah. coming in his presence. My
[2:06:54] my my man was created uh to be in the
[2:06:59] presence of God. We have heard in the
[2:07:01] Garden of Eden uh man was created to be
[2:07:04] in the presence of God. If you can, you
[2:07:06] may be seated, but if you want, you can
[2:07:08] still stand. Hallelujah. Man was created
[2:07:11] to be in the presence of God. We heard
[2:07:14] that Adam uh every cool of the evening
[2:07:16] God would come because there's a part of
[2:07:19] you that God always energizes. When he
[2:07:22] comes and appears, something in you is
[2:07:25] energized. Praise God. Amen. There's a
[2:07:28] seed word in you. He said it which gets
[2:07:32] energized by that presence of God.
[2:07:35] That's why God would come every day in
[2:07:38] the eul of the evening to meet Adam to
[2:07:42] energize him praise God but man fell.
[2:07:45] They fell out of the presence of God and
[2:07:48] uh and and and in uh that day on Calvary
[2:07:51] uh it it says uh a man took to
[2:07:54] wondering. They were wondering looking
[2:07:57] for a city whose builder and maker is
[2:08:00] God. Hallelujah. They knew that somehow
[2:08:05] this problem that has befallen the human
[2:08:07] race of being separated with God,
[2:08:10] somehow and if man could only find a way
[2:08:14] back to God, uh they can talk it over
[2:08:17] with God. Uh if you can only find a way
[2:08:20] back to the presence of God, uh you can
[2:08:23] talk it over. But there was no way.
[2:08:25] There was no way man was separated
[2:08:28] because of sin. But praise God for that
[2:08:31] day on Calvary. That day on Calvary,
[2:08:34] Jesus came and paid it all. He cried,
[2:08:37] "It is finished." And when he cried, "It
[2:08:40] is finished," the veil in the temple was
[2:08:44] rent. The way to God was open. Praise
[2:08:48] God. Amen. Hallelujah. And let me tell
[2:08:51] you, it was rent from top to bottom.
[2:08:55] Why? Because God it it was the one who
[2:08:57] was tearing was actually in heaven. It
[2:08:59] was up high. It was showing you it's God
[2:09:02] opening the way. Praise God. Amen. Into
[2:09:05] that temple. And remember in the Old
[2:09:07] Testament there was the holy of holies,
[2:09:09] the holiest where the shikina glory was.
[2:09:12] And and in that shikina glory only one
[2:09:15] man would enter and only once in a year
[2:09:18] to be a witness of that shakina glory.
[2:09:21] And he would not enter without blood.
[2:09:24] And he was not going to be playing when
[2:09:26] he enters there. Because when he sees
[2:09:28] the glory of God, he will die because of
[2:09:30] sin. Hallelujah. And what did they do
[2:09:34] when he enters there? They used to put a
[2:09:36] rope on them. So that if he dies in the
[2:09:39] presence of God, no one will enter there
[2:09:41] to get him out because they will also
[2:09:43] die. So they would put a rope and then
[2:09:45] they would pull them out. But do you
[2:09:47] know how they knew that the person has
[2:09:49] died in there? Because they are not
[2:09:51] going in there. They put bells on their
[2:09:53] feet so that when they were walking in
[2:09:55] the presence of God, the bells were
[2:09:58] going Kenj.
[2:10:01] They were going holy, holy, holy is the
[2:10:05] Lord of hosts. There was some noise
[2:10:07] inside there to show that there was
[2:10:09] life. Can I hear some noise here to show
[2:10:12] that there is life? Come on, say
[2:10:14] hallelujah.
[2:10:17] Hallelujah.
[2:10:19] And in that presence of God when uh the
[2:10:22] road of Aaron it was a dead dry stick.
[2:10:26] When it was placed in that presence of
[2:10:28] God it produced leaves and it produced
[2:10:32] fruits. Then they knew that this stick
[2:10:35] was taken from the almond tree. When you
[2:10:37] come in the presence of God I don't care
[2:10:40] how dry you are. I don't care how sinful
[2:10:43] you are. When we bring you in the
[2:10:45] presence of God, uh you are going to
[2:10:47] produce leaves. Uh then we shall know
[2:10:50] that this sister was taken from the tree
[2:10:53] of prophetess. She was taken. He was
[2:10:56] taken from a tree of preachers. Let's
[2:10:59] put you in the presence of God.
[2:11:02] Something in you will wake up. Whatever
[2:11:04] God has put in you before the foundation
[2:11:06] of the world, all that it needs is to
[2:11:09] come in the presence of God and it's
[2:11:11] going to blossom. You're going to
[2:11:13] prophesy. You're going to see visions.
[2:11:15] Uh you're going to speak in tongues. Uh
[2:11:18] then we shall know that this one was
[2:11:20] taken from a tree of tongue speakers.
[2:11:23] Praise God. Amen. We are called to be
[2:11:26] witnesses. We are called to be
[2:11:28] witnesses. Praise God. And there was
[2:11:30] mana in that presence that was not
[2:11:32] rotting. If we bring your life in the
[2:11:35] presence of God, your life is not going
[2:11:37] to rot. We are not going to hear some
[2:11:39] adultery. We are not going to hear some
[2:11:42] stealing. We are not going to hear some
[2:11:44] homosexuality. Come on. We got to go in
[2:11:47] the presence of God. The preacher is
[2:11:49] inviting us to go and become
[2:11:51] eyewitnesses to see God. Oh yes, Isaiah.
[2:11:56] Hallelujah. So the Lord his eyes were
[2:11:59] open to see the Lord. May God open our
[2:12:03] eyes today that we may behold the glory
[2:12:06] of God. That we may see the presence of
[2:12:08] God.
[2:12:09] And when he saw it, amen, he said, "Wo
[2:12:13] is me
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; for I'm undone." You can't come in the
[2:12:17] presence of God and remain proud. You
[2:12:20] can't come in the presence of God and
[2:12:22] remain a sinner. He was he was there and
[2:12:25] he cried. He says, "I'm undone." When
[2:12:28] you come and become a real witness of
[2:12:30] this presence of God, uh you are going
[2:12:32] to humble yourself. Uh you are going to
[2:12:34] say, "Lord, forgive my sins." Uh praise
[2:12:37] God. Amen. And you know the story never
[2:12:40] just ended there. Something happened.
[2:12:43] One of the saraphims picked a burning
[2:12:46] call from the altar of God and came to
[2:12:50] uh Isaiah to come and pass the call
[2:12:53] where the problem was. He says, "I'm a
[2:12:56] man of unclean lips." The saraphim heard
[2:12:59] his sin. The saraphim heard his problem.
[2:13:03] He took the call and passed it on his
[2:13:06] lips. And he says you are clean. I don't
[2:13:09] care where your problem is. Uh maybe
[2:13:11] your eyes like looking at nakedness.
[2:13:14] Maybe your eyes look like looking at
[2:13:16] pornography. Maybe your eyes. But on
[2:13:19] those same eyes as I'm preaching right
[2:13:22] now, the seraraphim is taking a call
[2:13:24] from the burning altar and pass it on
[2:13:27] your eyes so that you can see visions.
[2:13:30] So that you can see visions. Maybe your
[2:13:32] problem is you like speaking evil. You
[2:13:35] like cursing. But praise God uh the
[2:13:38] seraphim is passing it on your throat
[2:13:40] that you're going to be a good believer
[2:13:43] that you're going to prophesy that
[2:13:45] you're going to speak the words of God.
[2:13:47] Praise God. We are coming to be
[2:13:50] eyewitnesses. Praise God and hallelujah.
[2:13:54] Hallelujah.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; There were people who came in the
[2:13:57] presence of God. My things happened to
[2:14:01] them. Isaiah was cleansed and God says
[2:14:05] whom shall I send? When he cleanses you,
[2:14:08] you are ready to serve. You are ready to
[2:14:11] do something for the Lord. That's why
[2:14:13] he's cleansing you. Praise God.
[2:14:15] Hallelujah.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; There was many that came in the presence
[2:14:19] of God. Other eyewitnesses.
[2:14:22] Hallelujah.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus was invited
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; by a guy a guy called Simon. He invited
[2:14:29] him to mock him. Hallelujah.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; But praise God, while he was in the
[2:14:35] house of Simon, he was not welcome.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; And and and and we hear we hear a
[2:14:41] sermon, the unwelcomed Christ.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Many churches would gather like brother
[2:14:46] Brooks was saying, they do their
[2:14:49] religion
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; and they go out and Jesus is not
[2:14:53] welcome. Hallelujah. But we are not
[2:14:56] going to be like Simon. We want to
[2:14:58] welcome him in this service. Hallelujah.
[2:15:01] There was one called Mary. She was
[2:15:03] passing by and she looked and say, "Is
[2:15:06] that Jesus in the house of Simon with
[2:15:09] dirty feet?" Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:15:13] brother, sister, Jesus is here.
[2:15:15] Hallelujah. And she said, "I can't
[2:15:18] wait." She broke the protocols. She
[2:15:21] broke the order. She entered in that
[2:15:23] house and went at his feet and cried and
[2:15:28] washed his feet with her tears. And then
[2:15:31] she dried them with her hair.
[2:15:35] She said, "You were there." When Jesus
[2:15:38] found me,
[2:15:40] you did not feel what I felt when he
[2:15:44] wrote his loving arms around me. And you
[2:15:49] don't know the course
[2:15:51] of the oil
[2:15:53] in that alabaster
[2:15:56] box.
[2:15:58] She broke the alabaster box. She washed
[2:16:01] his feet. Oh, where are the merries
[2:16:04] today? When the presence of God appears
[2:16:07] in our midst like it is appearing right
[2:16:10] now. You can ask me, preacherman, how do
[2:16:13] you know that Jesus is here? He who
[2:16:15] promised cannot lie. Remember we said
[2:16:19] that God can't lie. He said where are
[2:16:23] two or three are gathered in the midst
[2:16:26] there I am somewhere somewhere in this
[2:16:29] building. Maybe it is here. Maybe it is
[2:16:32] there. Jesus is somewhere. Jesus is
[2:16:35] moving in this place.
[2:16:37] And uh you can approach him like Mary
[2:16:41] did and cried on his feet and say
[2:16:44] forgive me. He c she cried washed his
[2:16:48] feet with her tears and those sweet
[2:16:51] words came out from Jesus.
[2:16:54] Oh Mary, your sins which are many, they
[2:16:58] are forgiven. Hallelujah.
[2:17:01] Oh, he's saying those same words
[2:17:04] tonight. He's saying those same words
[2:17:06] today. Your sins which are many, they
[2:17:10] are forgiven. We are invited to approach
[2:17:13] him. We are invited to be his witnesses.
[2:17:16] Another guy came into the presence of
[2:17:18] God. His name was Jacob. As we are
[2:17:21] standing up, as we are standing up, I'm
[2:17:23] about to close. His name was Jacob. He
[2:17:27] came in the presence of God and he got a
[2:17:29] hold of the angel. He says, "I'll not
[2:17:32] let you go until you bless me." That's
[2:17:36] what you got to do. That's what I got to
[2:17:38] do. As we are in these services, as we
[2:17:41] are coming to the end of these services,
[2:17:43] the presence of God moving around in
[2:17:46] this building right now, you can say,
[2:17:48] "Lord Jesus, I'll not let you go until
[2:17:52] you change me." Oh, he he held the
[2:17:55] angel. Just the holding the holding. The
[2:17:59] angel knew this one won't let me go. And
[2:18:02] he hel he held the angel and said until
[2:18:04] you bless me. And the angel touched him
[2:18:07] and his walk was different. He's
[2:18:09] touching you right now. Your walk is
[2:18:11] getting different. You're not going to
[2:18:13] walk in that bar anymore. You're not
[2:18:16] going to go in that pub anymore. He's
[2:18:18] changing you. Your walk is changing as
[2:18:21] you are coming in the presence of God.
[2:18:23] Your walk is changing. Praise God. Amen.
[2:18:27] and he also changed his name. You are no
[2:18:30] longer Jacob. You are a prince with God.
[2:18:33] He's changing your name. You are no
[2:18:36] longer a backbiter, but you are a
[2:18:38] prophetess. He's changing your name. You
[2:18:41] are no longer a crook, but you are a
[2:18:43] preacher. He's changing your name. You
[2:18:46] are no longer a prostitute, but a sister
[2:18:49] in the Lord. Oh, brother, when we come
[2:18:52] in his presence, something happens. When
[2:18:56] we come in his presence, something
[2:18:58] happens. You can get a hold of him right
[2:19:00] now. Say, "Lord,
[2:19:03] remember me." As we enter boldly in his
[2:19:06] presence, claiming the blood of Jesus,
[2:19:10] saying, "Cover me, Lord." And we enter
[2:19:13] his presence with boldness. Lord, we are
[2:19:15] saying changes, Lord. Oh, we want to be
[2:19:18] eyewitnesses. We want to behold the
[2:19:21] glory of God.
[2:19:22] And as we behold the glory of God, we
[2:19:25] are being changed from glory to glory.
[2:19:29] We are being changed from one glory into
[2:19:32] another. From glory to glory, from glory
[2:19:35] to glory, we are beholding the glory of
[2:19:38] God. Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[2:19:41] Oh yes Lord. Oh Lord, we appreciate you.
[2:19:46] Oh, thank you Lord. As brother books
[2:19:48] take over. Yes. Thank you Lord. Thank
[2:19:52] you, Jesus.
[2:19:53] [Music]
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; What an amazing weekend.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here this morning
[2:20:11] who would love to give their lives to
[2:20:12] the Lord? Let's see by the raising of
[2:20:14] your hand.
[2:20:17] But God has been so good to us. And if
[2:20:20] the Lord should touch you at some
[2:20:22] another uh other time, another time you
[2:20:25] you see the ministers and you see uh uh
[2:20:28] uh brother Simmons and and the other
[2:20:32] ministers here or even somebody from the
[2:20:34] church, if you haven't been baptized in
[2:20:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:20:40] you have not yet seen that another
[2:20:42] dimension
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; where God reveals who he really is.
[2:20:47] Amen.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; But we thank you all for being here.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Let's give each other a round of
[2:20:52] applause.
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:20:58] We we come to the end of our services
[2:21:02] and it has been wonderful.
[2:21:05] Lord has been good. We have been all
[2:21:07] eyewitnesses
[2:21:09] of God today or and throughout these
[2:21:12] days.
[2:21:14] But let us bow now in a word of prayer.
[2:21:17] They have prepared food for you. So,
[2:21:19] we're going to pray uh over the food.
[2:21:22] Then we'll be dismissed. We pray that
[2:21:25] the Lord give you traveling mercies and
[2:21:27] grace uh wherever you uh are headed back
[2:21:31] to. Keep God on your mind. It's so late
[2:21:34] in the evening. And uh one thing for
[2:21:38] certain, the word this weekend uh will
[2:21:42] set you free. or it will imprison you.
[2:21:47] The same uh ark that saved Noah is the
[2:21:51] same ark uh the same water, excuse me,
[2:21:54] that saved Noah is the same water that
[2:21:56] brought judgment on the unbeliever. Keep
[2:21:58] that in mind as we pray. Heavenly Father
[2:22:02] God, we come before you. We thank you
[2:22:04] for your grace and your mercy. We thank
[2:22:06] you for being so good to us. Lord, you
[2:22:09] have been better to us than we've been
[2:22:11] to ourselves. This has been such a a
[2:22:14] wonderful time. We give honor to you and
[2:22:17] all of those who participate. Bless
[2:22:19] them, Lord. Strengthen them, oh God, in
[2:22:21] your name, Jesus. Oh God, as we travel.
[2:22:24] So Lord, we also pray for the food that
[2:22:27] has been prepared. We pray that you
[2:22:29] bless the food, sanctify it to the
[2:22:31] nourishing our bodies, oh God, and bless
[2:22:33] the hands that prepared it. In your
[2:22:35] lovely name, Jesus Christ, we pray as we
[2:22:38] are dismissed. Amen.
