[34:40] amen if you have your Bibles tonight
[34:42] we'd like to turn to the Book of Mark
[34:47] Mark chapter 9.
[34:49] and we'll start at verse 23.
[35:03] Mark chapter 9 and verse 23 when you got
[35:05] it say Amen
[35:11] amen and it reads and Jesus said unto
[35:14] him
[35:14] if thou can't believe all things are
[35:18] possible to him that believers and
[35:21] straightway the father of the child
[35:23] crawled out and said with tears Lord I
[35:27] believe help down my unbelief amen God
[35:31] bless the reading of the word you may be
[35:33] seated
[35:35] Amen on tonight I'd like to take a
[35:37] little topic a little simple topic that
[35:40] says only believe
[35:43] only believe in this scripture here we
[35:46] read about a man who had a troubled son
[35:49] his son was vexed with with demons that
[35:52] was bothering him the spirit of death
[35:54] and the spirit of dumb they were
[35:56] bothering him and they caused him to do
[35:58] unruly things and this son he finally
[36:01] the father came and he said I got to
[36:03] find some help
[36:04] he said I got to go to someone that can
[36:07] help me my child is vexed with a spirit
[36:09] and he went to the disciples and the
[36:12] disciples
[36:13] he said he knew that they were men of
[36:16] Faith so he said he turned to the
[36:17] disciples and he asked him to pray for
[36:19] him and that he may be healed but the
[36:23] disciple disciples they prayed and they
[36:25] prayed and Jesus wasn't there and they
[36:28] cannot cast them out
[36:30] and he came to him and and and when
[36:33] Jesus came he he was asking them what's
[36:36] going on what's what's going on and the
[36:38] father said I brought my son that he
[36:40] might be delivered when Jesus told him
[36:43] that thou can't believe all things are
[36:45] possible to him now believeth and the
[36:48] father said Lord I believe and help my
[36:51] um thou my unbelief in Jesus laid his
[36:53] hands on him and he caused the spirit to
[36:55] come out of the young man because that
[36:57] father he believed for his son's healing
[37:00] he believed that God can do the
[37:02] impossible he believed that God can take
[37:05] over this situation where the demons
[37:07] seem to control his son God could still
[37:10] heal him God could deliver him and there
[37:12] was no one else that could do it but
[37:14] Jesus the disciples couldn't do it and
[37:17] he reads now in verse 29 and it says and
[37:20] and they asked the disciples asked the
[37:22] Lord
[37:23] they asked him and they and they said
[37:25] Lord why couldn't we do it why could we
[37:28] not cast them out in verse 28 and now in
[37:30] verse 29 and he said unto unto them
[37:34] this kind can come forth by nothing but
[37:38] by prayer and fasting
[37:40] see the disciples had not come to the
[37:42] point where they had put in the time
[37:44] even though they believe God God told
[37:47] them you still got to do some more work
[37:49] not only you got to believe but you got
[37:51] to pray and fast and get a hold of God
[37:53] till you know that something has
[37:55] happened and no in this man of God he
[37:57] said Lord I believe help my unbelief and
[38:00] I want to speak to and say only believe
[38:02] all things are possible see there are
[38:05] many instances in the Bible where we see
[38:07] where where people believe and God
[38:10] changed their situations God changed the
[38:13] dire into something that it would seem
[38:15] to be on Impossible
[38:18] in Mark chapter 2 we'll turn there Mark
[38:21] chapter 2.
[38:23] this is another instance
[38:26] of of some people that believed
[38:29] there are many opportunities in the
[38:31] Bible where you see an individual
[38:32] believe but how about the ones that are
[38:34] around you and this story is there was a
[38:37] man
[38:38] and we'll read and we'll start at verse
[38:40] one
[38:41] and again he entered the Capernaum after
[38:43] some days and it was noise that he was
[38:46] in the house and straightway many were
[38:49] gathered together in so much that there
[38:52] was no room to receive them no not so
[38:55] much of as about the door
[38:57] and he preached the word unto them and
[38:59] they can't come unto him bringing one
[39:02] sick of the palsy that was born of four
[39:06] uh born means to be carried and when
[39:08] they they cannot come nigh unto him for
[39:11] the Press they uncovered the roof where
[39:14] he was and when they have broken it up
[39:17] they let down the bed wherein the sick
[39:20] of the palsy lay when Jesus saw their
[39:23] faith he said unto the sick of the palsy
[39:25] son thou sins be forgiven thee
[39:29] see there was some friends that had
[39:31] faith and believed that God could heal
[39:33] their friend they believed that even
[39:35] though this man I was sick he couldn't
[39:37] get to Jesus but I had the faith they
[39:40] had the faith that Jesus could heal them
[39:42] so they said that even though he can't
[39:44] get there I can stand in in a seed form
[39:47] I can bring him to Jesus and let God do
[39:50] his work I can bring him even though we
[39:52] may have to press through Jesus said he
[39:55] saw that faith and he said unto the sick
[39:58] of Paul's son not sins be forgiven and
[40:00] in that moment he was healed God had
[40:03] done the thing for their friend because
[40:05] they believed they believed that that
[40:08] all things were possible and we can just
[40:10] get to Jesus if we can bring him to
[40:12] Jesus all things are possible and see
[40:15] that's that's what sometimes it's not
[40:18] just your faith it can be the faith of
[40:20] the ones around you
[40:22] the Bible says
[40:24] the Bible says let the weak let the
[40:27] strong bear the infirmities of the weak
[40:29] because many of times they're going to
[40:30] be moments and times where you're not
[40:33] you're not at full strength but those
[40:35] that are around you can uplift you
[40:37] because they believe that God can do a
[40:39] work for you they believe that God can
[40:42] intervene in your situation it's the
[40:44] ones around you that can uplift you and
[40:46] hold you up and say Lord I know that you
[40:48] will I know that they're down but Lord
[40:51] you can lift them up Lord I know that
[40:53] they're sick but I know you're a Healer
[40:54] Lord I know that they're in a situation
[40:57] they need Deliverance Lord I'm asking
[40:59] you to move on their case see these four
[41:02] friends they believe that God could heal
[41:04] their friend they believe that we have
[41:06] faith that even though we may have to go
[41:08] through something we may have to unbury
[41:10] this root uncover this route but we're
[41:13] gonna get to Jesus we're going to get in
[41:15] our prayer closet we're going to get
[41:16] down on our knees and say Lord help them
[41:18] Lord help them they can't get to you but
[41:21] Lord I can intercede for them I can
[41:23] press my way to to you and Lord I want
[41:25] you to do a work for them see that
[41:28] sometimes it's the ones around you that
[41:29] can uplift you it's the ones around you
[41:32] that can make sometimes the Lord impress
[41:34] on your heart to pray for someone and
[41:37] though in those moments they may be
[41:39] going through something that you may not
[41:41] know you may not understand but God has
[41:43] you there interceding for them to
[41:45] strengthen them to lift them up to bring
[41:47] them out of what they may be going
[41:49] through so there's multiple instances in
[41:52] the Bible where we see this
[41:54] it was a woman in the book of Kings
[41:57] it was and the Bible calls her the
[41:59] shooter by woman and she had she was she
[42:03] was bearing without child and one day
[42:05] the the prophet of the Lord went by a
[42:07] house and because she blessed the
[42:09] prophet of the Lord
[42:10] he
[42:12] she asked her what what does she want
[42:15] what and she said nothing and then the
[42:17] servant of God said then they don't have
[42:20] a child so God blessed them with a child
[42:22] and when they came forward and then one
[42:24] day the child got sick it got so sick
[42:28] that the child died and the wife she
[42:30] said I'm going to find the prophet of
[42:32] God I'm going to ask him and when the
[42:35] prophet of God seen her he told his
[42:36] servant to go out and ask her was
[42:38] everything all right and she said all is
[42:40] well
[42:41] see she had Faith she believed that no
[42:44] matter how dire the situation looked all
[42:46] was well and when the prophet came she
[42:48] said you got to come back to the house
[42:51] and she and he says everything right she
[42:53] said all is well and so he came back to
[42:56] the house because of how she was acting
[42:59] and and then she said her son had had
[43:02] passed away
[43:04] and he's he went in there in the room
[43:07] and laid on him and he breathed the
[43:09] breath of life into him and God brought
[43:11] him back because she believed a mother
[43:13] believed for her child that God could do
[43:16] the impossible a mother stood in the Gap
[43:18] and said my child can no longer but Lord
[43:20] you prom you gave me this child and you
[43:24] didn't give him just to take them back
[43:25] for from me and see see she believed
[43:30] all it takes is one to believe that God
[43:33] can do the impossible and the impossible
[43:36] can happen tonight all it takes is one
[43:39] person to believe that God can do the
[43:41] impossible and the impossible can take
[43:43] place see God is the god of the
[43:46] impossible he's the god that can do the
[43:49] things that are unseen through the
[43:51] things that we can't even imagine God
[43:53] can do those things just like this you
[43:55] know my woman death is the final stage
[43:58] but God brought him back to life see she
[44:01] believed that God could do it she
[44:03] believed that God was the one that was
[44:05] able to do the impossible
[44:08] see there's another instance where I
[44:10] look in the Book of Mark chapter 10 and
[44:13] there was a man that was blind he was a
[44:15] beggar and he sat on the side on the
[44:17] road and he heard that Jesus was passing
[44:20] by they called him Bartimaeus and when
[44:23] he passed by he said he said Son of
[44:25] David Son of David have mercy on me
[44:28] son of David Son of David have mercy on
[44:31] me and the other people around him said
[44:33] be quiet we trying to hear him or be
[44:36] quiet you too loud but he said Son of
[44:38] David Son of David have mercy on me
[44:41] see this man didn't care what anyone
[44:44] else thought about him he didn't care
[44:46] that they told him to be quiet he knew
[44:48] that Jesus was passing by see he
[44:51] believed that if I can get to Jesus
[44:53] something was going to happen for me if
[44:55] I believe that if I can get to Jesus my
[44:58] situation can change I believe that if I
[45:01] get to Jesus then God will do something
[45:04] for me he says son of David have mercy
[45:07] on me and Jesus heard him and he told
[45:09] him to come to him paraphrasing he told
[45:12] him to come to him and when he got to
[45:14] him he said what what would you what
[45:16] would what can I give you he said Lord I
[45:18] want my sight
[45:19] and God and God and the Lord blessed him
[45:22] with his sight and he and he was
[45:24] thanking God and praised God and he
[45:26] followed him because of what God had
[45:28] done had done for him see he had the
[45:30] faith to believe that all things were
[45:32] possible he had the faith that if I can
[45:35] get to Jesus my situation will change if
[45:39] I only believe that I can get to him I
[45:41] know he can do something for me I know
[45:44] that he can change my my circumstances
[45:46] see I'm a beggar but if I can receive my
[45:49] sight I can provide if I if I can
[45:51] receive my sight I can do the things
[45:53] that I need to do that God positioned me
[45:56] and Abel and place me to do in this life
[45:58] see that's what he was looking for
[46:01] see if you can only believe
[46:05] James said in James chapter 4
[46:09] he said you have not because you're as
[46:12] not
[46:13] and you act and when you ask you ask a
[46:15] miss
[46:16] see James was trying to point out that
[46:18] many times we asked but we don't ask in
[46:21] the right Spirit we don't ask for the
[46:22] right things
[46:24] sometimes we ask for wants and not needs
[46:27] sometimes we ask for things that that
[46:30] God may not want to give to us because
[46:32] he knows that we can't handle it
[46:34] sometimes we ask for things that we
[46:37] can't see that it's a trap down the road
[46:39] but God can so he doesn't give it to us
[46:43] see there's many things but he said if
[46:45] only you can believe all things are
[46:48] possible and see there's a story in the
[46:51] in the Book of Mark
[46:54] in the book of in the Book of Luke
[46:56] actually Luke chapter 8 and it's a it's
[46:59] a Pharisee who one day his daughter got
[47:02] sick
[47:03] and and the Pharisee was Jerry Jarius
[47:06] and he said that he might have thought
[47:08] about his status he might have thought
[47:11] about where he had made it in position
[47:13] in life he might have thought about all
[47:15] the things that he had achieved achieved
[47:17] but he got to a certain point in place
[47:19] where he realized I have a need
[47:22] see Jerry has had a need and he had a
[47:25] need because his only child was dying
[47:27] and that's the same thing that it is
[47:29] tonight see when you get to a place that
[47:32] you get a need that no one else can fix
[47:34] it but God
[47:35] when you get to that place that you
[47:37] realize I got a need that no one else
[47:40] can do anything about this but God see
[47:43] you your face start to rise because you
[47:45] realize that I can't turn to the right I
[47:48] can't turn to the left I can't turn go
[47:50] forward or go back God has to lead me
[47:52] through this see Jerry has got to that
[47:55] point where he had a need and he said I
[47:58] I I've heard I've searched the
[48:00] scriptures I understand that I know that
[48:02] this is the one true God and see
[48:05] he said the daughter was dying and many
[48:09] people might have tried to convince him
[48:11] at that house not to go follow she find
[48:14] Jesus but he he realized that he had a
[48:17] need and he had to go it was time for
[48:19] him to take action it was time for him
[48:22] not to just believe in secret but to go
[48:25] and find Jesus to go search him out and
[48:28] go find where Jesus was because he had a
[48:30] need see he believed that if I can get
[48:33] to Jesus my daughter can be healed if I
[48:36] can get to Jesus I know he can change
[48:39] the situation see it was a Time for
[48:42] Action
[48:43] and and see Jerry has had to get to
[48:45] Christ he had to get Christ on the scene
[48:48] or his child would die he had to hurry
[48:51] real quick he he had to spring into
[48:53] action he had to get into action to find
[48:56] Jesus see Jesus wasn't right there with
[48:59] them
[49:00] he had to go in search of him he had to
[49:03] go look for him he didn't necessarily
[49:05] might not have known where he was but he
[49:06] had to go find him because he knew he
[49:09] the only one that could turn this
[49:11] situation around
[49:13] was Jesus and he said somebody said
[49:16] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[49:20] the word of God see you got to have
[49:22] faith you got to believe that all things
[49:24] are possible you got to believe that God
[49:26] can change your situation and see when
[49:30] they were there first thing and they
[49:32] come along and he said he walked down
[49:34] and see you understanding that Jerry is
[49:38] he might have was looking and then
[49:39] something happened while he was on his
[49:42] way to Jesus there was another thing
[49:44] that occurred during during when Jarius
[49:47] was on his way he noticed that there was
[49:50] a woman
[49:51] that was in the crowd and maybe he
[49:54] recognized her maybe he didn't he
[49:56] noticed that she was making her way
[49:59] she was trying to push her way through
[50:01] the Thrones of people to get to Jesus
[50:03] and there was many people in the way and
[50:06] she might have she might have couldn't
[50:07] push away she might have had to get down
[50:10] on her hands and knees to get to Jesus
[50:12] she might have had to crawl but she said
[50:15] any way I can get there I gotta get
[50:17] there because I need Jesus to do
[50:19] something for me any way that I it
[50:22] doesn't matter what stands in my way I
[50:24] gotta get to Jesus because I believe
[50:26] that if I can Touch the Hem of His
[50:28] Garment I know that my sicknesses will
[50:30] be well I know that God will do will
[50:33] heal my body see she didn't care what
[50:36] was in her way she just believed that if
[50:38] she could get to Jesus all would be well
[50:40] and see Jerry is smarter watched that
[50:43] and not matter it might have gave him
[50:45] some faith that you know what I know
[50:48] that if I can get to Jesus he can fix my
[50:50] situation if God can do that for her and
[50:53] when she touched him of Jesus garment it
[50:56] took some virtue out of him and Jesus
[50:58] looked around and he said who touched me
[51:01] who touched me and Peter and the
[51:03] disciples say Lord we packed with people
[51:06] around me what do you mean who touched
[51:08] me but Jesus knew that virtue had left
[51:11] them and he and when he did it
[51:13] she said Lord I
[51:15] he she said I touched you he said go thy
[51:18] way thy faith has made thee well see she
[51:21] her faith because she believed the Lord
[51:24] healed her see if you can only believe
[51:27] tonight God can do something miraculous
[51:29] for you
[51:30] he said I imagine that encouraged old
[51:33] Jarius don't you imagine so directly
[51:35] here he come running through and said
[51:37] Lord my little girl is laying now at the
[51:40] point of death Lord Master oh yes he's
[51:43] all right he's not a fanatic now oh no
[51:46] he's got a need he's got a need of him
[51:50] and see
[51:53] as they were on their way back to his
[51:55] home someone came running and they said
[51:58] Jarius he said they might have told him
[52:02] don't bother now you don't have to
[52:04] trouble the master because your daughter
[52:06] has died
[52:08] he said they might have done later up
[52:10] and got her ready to burial not even
[52:12] embalmed her and we got the doctor to
[52:15] come and he pronounced to dead
[52:17] and charius
[52:19] might have he might have fought to
[52:22] but said Jesus was walking steadily
[52:25] it never bothered him a bit
[52:28] because Jesus said I can see him turn
[52:30] his eyes and he looked at him said
[52:32] didn't I say only believe
[52:35] didn't I say to you only believe
[52:38] and that's what I'm here to say to you
[52:40] only believe God's word and if you want
[52:42] to see the glory of God only believe no
[52:46] matter what anybody else says to you no
[52:49] matter how how they point at you and say
[52:51] that can never happen no matter how much
[52:54] they said that's impossible if you only
[52:57] believe God can do the impossible amen I
[53:01] said
[53:02] and he might have said my baby can't get
[53:04] well but only believe that's all only
[53:07] believe that God made the promise that
[53:10] he made the promise to you not me not
[53:13] anybody else not the preacher not the
[53:14] minister but God made a promise to you
[53:17] and if you only believe in his promise
[53:19] God will do what he said he would do
[53:22] because he said in my word go out of my
[53:24] mouth it can't return unto me void it
[53:27] must accomplish what I said it must do
[53:29] see God is able to do the impossible
[53:33] he said didn't I say unto you I only
[53:35] believe if you want to see the glory of
[53:37] God oh I can imagine I helped them don't
[53:40] you I imagine seeing this little heart
[53:42] skipping them beats but just beating
[53:45] back regular again said critics can say
[53:48] anything they want to but it takes What
[53:51] God Says to make it be the truth
[53:55] said no matter what they may say about
[53:57] it what God says is the truth
[54:00] now Jesus said only believe and you
[54:03] might ask the question believe what
[54:05] believe what now she's dead
[54:08] he said believe for The Impossibles
[54:11] yes believe for the impossible why after
[54:15] she's done dead and bomb believe now
[54:17] sure I told you just believe if you want
[54:20] to see the glory of God
[54:23] believe what you may ask and said
[54:25] believe anything verily I say unto you
[54:27] if you shall say to this mountain be thy
[54:30] move and don't doubt in our heart just
[54:31] only believe you can ask what you say
[54:34] that's right he that believeth in me
[54:37] though he were dead yet shall he live
[54:39] and whosoever believeth in me shall
[54:41] never die and if you abide in me and my
[54:44] word abide which in you you can ask what
[54:46] you will and it will be given to you
[54:48] isn't that right
[54:50] see all those promises are the book are
[54:53] in the book that God gave us if we only
[54:56] believed if we only believe that all
[54:58] these things are possible then they can
[55:00] happen for us
[55:03] he said the works that I do you shall do
[55:05] also Greater Works than this shall you
[55:08] do
[55:09] amen and all these promises here because
[55:12] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[55:15] and forever see if you only believe God
[55:17] can do what he did back then if he
[55:20] brought him out of the Red Sea is your
[55:22] problem bigger than the Red Sea
[55:24] is your situation bigger than the Red
[55:27] Sea but he parted the Red Sea to let his
[55:30] children walk across on dry land because
[55:33] they believed that God was going to
[55:34] deliver them from their enemies they
[55:37] believed that God you promised that that
[55:39] we would only stay here for a little
[55:41] while then you would take us to our
[55:43] promised land and God parted the Red
[55:45] Seas that they can reach their promise
[55:48] that they can reach what he told them he
[55:50] would give to them how much more would
[55:52] he do for you
[55:54] how much more can he do for you if he
[55:56] can part the Red Seas what do you
[55:58] believe he can do for you so you only
[56:00] believe only believe because he's coming
[56:02] soon see he's coming sooner than we may
[56:05] think but we must believe that God can
[56:08] do it for us that God can Deliver Us
[56:11] from these things so we can get out of
[56:12] here that God can do the impossible
[56:16] and when they got to Jerry's house said
[56:19] they went through the house and there
[56:20] was a whole bunch of them that were
[56:22] sitting there
[56:23] and that and and when that and when
[56:25] Jesus he he walked up to him and said
[56:27] this oh she'll be all right or is that
[56:31] she's sleeping all the pokes in there
[56:33] they started laughing
[56:35] and then Jesus he went and then he put
[56:38] them out all those that see sometimes he
[56:41] had to separate the people that did
[56:43] believe from the ones that did
[56:46] the people that didn't believe he had to
[56:48] separate them he had to get him away
[56:50] because God couldn't work around the
[56:53] people that didn't believe
[56:54] see sometimes the folks around you can
[56:57] hinder your faith sometimes the one that
[57:00] a circle say that the closest to you be
[57:02] there but they can hinder your faith
[57:04] they can stop you from getting what God
[57:07] wants to give to you and Jesus removed
[57:10] them and he put them out because they
[57:11] laughed at the word yeah then he got
[57:14] them all out and then Jesus was alone he
[57:17] was alone with only the ones that he
[57:19] brought with him he said the
[57:20] Brokenhearted and the faithful he
[57:23] brought Peter James and John which
[57:25] represented a faith hope and charity and
[57:28] he put them in there with with the room
[57:31] with the with the Brokenhearted
[57:32] believers the ones that was there and
[57:35] they believed Jerry is Jarius and his
[57:38] wife and the little thing was laid out
[57:41] and he put the unbelievers away from him
[57:43] so when he got everything out everyone
[57:46] out
[57:47] everybody but just his faith hope and
[57:49] charity standing there and the faithful
[57:51] ones the real believe in father and
[57:53] mother he walked over to the corpse
[57:57] excuse me
[57:59] but if he could and Jesus but see he had
[58:03] to but if he could just get them shut
[58:05] out to a place that he could be with the
[58:08] Believers sometimes the Lord has to move
[58:11] you to a place that you're around the
[58:13] ones that believe that you're only
[58:15] around the ones that believe that have
[58:17] faith that God can move in your
[58:19] situation now have faith that God can do
[58:23] something that is impossible and then he
[58:25] walked over and he tooks her by the hand
[58:27] and he looked out there into the space
[58:29] World Yonder somewhere where her soul
[58:32] went and said Maiden arise see how could
[58:35] death exist in the presence of life
[58:38] how could death exist in the presence of
[58:41] life and all because someone believed
[58:44] that God that he could do the impossible
[58:47] all because a father believed that Jesus
[58:50] if I get him here he can move on my
[58:53] behalf if I get him in the room no
[58:56] matter how dire the situation may look
[58:58] all things are possible
[59:01] see all things are possible only believe
[59:03] what was he he was he was word of God
[59:06] flesh and tonight they're the same God
[59:10] is the same word of God is in your flesh
[59:13] if Christ is in is in there he's the
[59:16] same Lord Jesus he could touch his go
[59:19] you could touch His Garment or whatever
[59:21] you wish to if you only believe that
[59:24] he's here he will do the same thing for
[59:27] you do you believe it
[59:29] see God he had a way of reaching now
[59:32] because someone's Faith reached him
[59:35] because someone got down the business
[59:37] and said Lord I believe
[59:39] that all things are possible Lord I
[59:41] believe that no matter how dire the
[59:43] situation may look all things are
[59:46] possible see he got down to the point
[59:48] that no matter I only I don't have no
[59:51] other choice I don't have no one I can
[59:54] turn to the doctor has given me up the
[59:57] doctor had given her up everyone else
[59:59] but said that even the servant came and
[1:00:01] said she's dead and they're there
[1:00:03] mourning her but he got to the one that
[1:00:05] he had to still believe that God could
[1:00:08] do the impossible he had to still
[1:00:10] believe the woman the shooter my woman
[1:00:12] she had to still believe that God could
[1:00:15] do the impossible the man the friends
[1:00:18] that were that if the the people that
[1:00:21] their friend was sick they still had to
[1:00:23] believe that if we could get him to
[1:00:25] Jesus all things were possible
[1:00:27] see there's so many the blind water
[1:00:30] Mayors believe that if I can call on
[1:00:32] Jesus he will answer say if I can get
[1:00:35] his attention I know Jesus can change my
[1:00:38] situation see all I have to do is
[1:00:40] believe it's so simple all you have to
[1:00:43] do is believe and God can do the
[1:00:45] impossible God can do more than you ever
[1:00:48] could think
[1:00:49] and then you can think see sometimes he
[1:00:52] has you standing in in intercession for
[1:00:55] others so God can do the work see there
[1:00:58] was a mother that had to cry for her
[1:01:00] children there was a father that had to
[1:01:02] cry for his daughter there was one that
[1:01:05] had to cry for themselves like blind
[1:01:07] Bartimaeus but they said if I can get to
[1:01:09] Jesus all things are possible if I only
[1:01:12] believe see that's what I want you to
[1:01:15] get tonight if you only believe all
[1:01:17] things are possible if you only believe
[1:01:19] that God can turn it he can do it for

[1:01:38] believe that you can change you can fix

[1:01:43] need Lord Jesus sometimes the minister
[1:01:46] may not know what you need but God
[1:01:48] always knows God all always knows what
[1:01:51] you're going through he always knows the
[1:01:53] twists and turns of life that you're
[1:01:55] going through and he said if you can

[1:02:02] more than you can ask a thing if you
