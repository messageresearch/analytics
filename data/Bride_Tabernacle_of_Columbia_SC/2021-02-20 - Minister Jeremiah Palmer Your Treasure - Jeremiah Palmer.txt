places the first in the book of proverbs 15th chapter i do want to thank each and every one of you for your prayers for my mother and my two sisters um all of them have fully recovered and doing real well amen in jesus christ's name so my mom i got a picture from her today and you know she's going on 100 in april um and then lord bless the way she was eating fish and grits and doing everything like she normally do so we do want to appreciate him in your prayers amen my sisters those send their greetings to you too in jesus christ's name amen proverbs the 15th chapter in the sixth verse and then matthew 16. proverbs 15 and 6 it says in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble let's go ahead and pray and let you be seated heavenly father god we thank you god for your word tonight lord may your blessed oh god quicken it in jesus name we pray amen and amen you'll be seated we want to read some of the book of matthew the sixth chapter you're not gonna be long at all tonight in jesus christ's name matthew 6. having to depend on these glasses more and more [Music] 19 it says lay that up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust will corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rusted with corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also tonight we want to use for a little thought for a few minutes tonight on your treasures your treasures and you know when you think about treasures you think about something that is of value something that is worthwhile holding on to [Music] a lot of times people have what they call sentimental values of things that they maybe had when they were a child and because of maybe who gave it to them they they want to just be uh hold it as a memorial because it means something to them maybe as a memory of who gave it to her sometimes people hold on to thank because of the value that it may be later on maybe it's not much now but we call it antiques that be worth something that uh maybe like i noticed a lot of times when i looked that used to look at a lot of this station that had a lot of i don't know what they call the people that they go out into the desert and entire to the remote places and they have been studying about and trying to find out uh where these hidden treasures are at and i remember watching one that they really uh uh had to plan carefully because where they had to go it was very risky but to them it meant something and they were willing to almost put their lives at danger because they were looking at what they were and looking to receive and i believe that anything that's worth anything there's a price to it i believe that what god even as a proverb said here that in the house of the righteous there's much treasures and i believe sometimes that we really don't recognize what we have in our possession because it's it's not the money oh it's not something that you know you can spend all but it's worth more than that i believe in god gave made us he gave us a soul in a circle that soul is worth me in the world they're worth about 10 000 worlds and the reason why because no money uh uh it can purchase it it's worth more than just uh what we can spend but it even can has heavenly value that's why he said hey where your heart is that will your treasure be when we really understand the price and what god did to rid us from the sin and the corruption to to give us something worthwhile to make life more than just fun and games and good times but this is an eternal plan something that no moss and and and no uh nothing can corrupt it but it has eternal value and we all can say within our life you know that god been good to us he been good at that we don't even deserve what he has given to us but yet he gave it to you in spite of and then how we cherish it what do we do with what god has given to us how we handle it you know if you really have something a way to value you really put it in a a special place that well nobody here really knew me nowhere is at and only you it's your secret and your soul ought to be just that precious to you don't let nothing uh or corrupt that regardless of what the world may offer or what value other things around you you got something that's worth more than that oh my and you know the more you you learn about god and and what god expects and what he has given to us you know i uh before i come in i gave rachel another thought you know about uh more than conquerors you know but it kind of goes in a little bit with it you know because you know god uh he was the mighty conqueror and reason why we are more than conquered we didn't do nothing even for it it was given to us and what price what what all was done to to to do that to to make us be beneficiaries of everything heaven god it's worth my dying it's worth all the suffering all the persecution yes you may have to cry a little while but don't worry god gonna wipe away all the tears the father say weeping men do for a night but joy cometh in the morning oh yeah i'll remember you sing that song i know it's worth it you got to ask yourself sometime is it really worth it is it worth you giving up everything of the world for does god really mean that much to you that there is nothing he can uh uh a devil can offer you that'll make you sell your birthright if you notice esau uh and jacob you know and uh they had esau didn't care much about the birthright at all but jacob was willing to do anything to get it it meant something to him esau was ready to sell it out because he was hungry for food you know and you look at the scenario you know people they are so easy to sell out for something on this earth they will leave from the presence of god and say well it's just too hard i'd rather take my chances and go through the hardship and stay with the things of god than to be a coward and just go away and just worry about oh i just couldn't do it it just seemed to be too hard so hard but let me tell you something is sin easy or is it hard the bible said the way of a transgressor is hard you pay for every evil thing you got to do and look what you benefit out of it [Music] nothing you got to spit it all over again the next day to try to make yourself happy to pretend that i'm just enjoying what i'm doing but at the end of the day you got to lay down with all that you've done and you got to ask yourself what if i leave here tonight where would i wake up at what have i done with the life that god gave me it's worth you giving up everything that this world can offer you you know as i hear brother earnest you know testimony and how you know the devil put challenges to you to for you know to give up some of the things of god you know and it's all right you know like the man say you know i go to church you know but post everybody on the job on a gold or whatever do but see there there's god i i know there is certain things that people really hold dear to from their heart is is not something they're just saying because they get out of doing something but it becomes a great price to them it's my life to not be able to be in the presence of god and and to give god thanks for all that he has done for you even the very life you got right now even your career everything you own is because of him it's not so much that you are a good person because you know the people on that job don't care nothing about you all they want is their work done but when they see something uh a person that really is not hypocritical about this standing day about to bend then they'll begin to say well i'll tell you what i've learned to say come after work then you know otherwise they understand that this guy means something to him what what is it about him no doubt ernesto looked at everybody probably saying you know that legetta fella you know because see they always let your name go out of the office and talk about what you thought to the boss man and they wondering what is it about him then he began to inquire does he always act like this is always conducted it says sir he always did why because he realized what he had is worth a great price it's a hidden trash that you can't explain it but to you it's all you got without that who am i without god in your life who are you you may be a multi-millionaire you may be successful you may even own our countries and banks but at the end of the day what is it going to matter it don't take but one illness to hit that body and then you can't even go to the bank to get the money you work for you might not even remember you even got the money because that mind can just leave just like that you know when the old people said lord keep my mind there's something about that mind that old people always surprised him my mom said lord keep my mind keep my mind because that mind is it can just go out you forget where you live or who you are i noticed my mom at 99 she still know who she is you know she's getting a little you know getting us a little fix up now because we a lot of us and she said who are you with this i want my sister to say that i said well how mama doing this well she is back to normal because she's really getting on our nerves again i said well that's a good sign you know what and she's able to say that we wouldn't take nothing for it though but one thing they say mama always she said all she could say was jesus is going to fix it see she had something she she she got in contact with something that was real and no matter what comes the goal she know jesus will be on the scene and if he don't go hey i'll see y'all on the other side see she had a hidden treasure she don't let nothing uh just get her down like that you know she being called what's y'all sad for you know y'all better going to serve the lord you know because she realized that her days are getting short you know but god been good and we look out and examine our lives and you think things over about what you got and where you act and where you are heading what do you see go with me to one scripture book of hebrews as soon as it's raining in my mind i know he is worth it i know he's worth it he's worth my dying uh he's worth everything you ever go through yes paul said trouble on every side but yet not cast down hebrews 11. 2011 and 24 these heroes of faith you know oftentimes you know wonder in the old testament how the hebrew the faith was testifying of a city and things that they were looking for and yet they died didn't even see it but yet they had hope that it will be there 11 24 said by faith moses when he was come to years refuse to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter and the mother didn't want to have nothing to do with it it said in 25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god didn't enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn shall touch them see moses saw something greater than what was in egypt though he was heir to it all yet moses said he'd rather suffer affliction with the people of god didn't enjoy pleasure how many of us are really ready to forsake what this world is trying to offer pleasure that's all they can offer something to satisfy our flesh to just give us some leisure confidence but yet we understand that there is a suffering that we have to endure but we realize it's worth every bit of it [Music] yes we have to be uh go through even in this very hour of what the world is encountering but yet we got a greater hope than this we'll realize that god has given us something that is able to take us through regardless of what comes and what goes the bible say greater is he he that is in you then it is in the world you're treacherous the bible says one place that eyes have not seen is they've not heard the thing that god has in store for them that love him your treasures god riches and treasures that he has given to you and i right here in the word you're rich you're more richer than anything that earth could buy yet you may not look like it but yet you are calling those things as though they are not god bless you tonight god rich in mercy amen we appreciate the word tonight treasures where your treasure is that will your heart be also amen so we thank god amen that god is so rich in mercy amen so many things amen that the world the devil would offer us can y'all hear me all right so many things that the devil would offer us but we have the greatest thing amen and that's god i was i was telling thank caleb i said this message that god has given us in this hour shows us [Music] goes way back before the earth was before [Music] the foundation of the world and shows you that you were in god you were part of god and that means everything and if you were part of god then then your son and daughter to god now amen but to manifest who you are you can't help it [Music] you have to manifest the word for your hour the hour you live in if you were a son of god a daughter god nobody can stop that amen no devil [Music] can make you amen any less than what god made you before the foundation of the world god died for you jesus died for us amen and in that he died for us you are his that's all right i don't know why i did that when i got up here but um by the grace of god you are god's treasure amen you're god's peculiar people you god's role your diadem amen and you you know i was reading in matthew that man found a field and he sold everything he had to go by once you find this field everything you got you give up to go preach at that field so by the grace of god everything that we got we give up for jesus christ everything nothing matters we find something worth giving up everything for amen and that's this tragedy this treasure that god has given us is eternal life i like that message god reached in mercy amen greater riches amen god has given us greater riches amen the dollar will be devalued gold prices might drop all of that the world be dissolved and melt with the fervent heat but you have eternal life you have eternal weight of glory says god has given you that hold out keep pressing the battle keep trusting god i'm gonna tell you as something song says what god has for you it is what god has for me and it's for me and i'm gonna tell you something if you think you can get it then you got the wrong kind of thinking you said what god has for me it is for me amen not what you have for yourself amen what god has for me it is for me and i'm gonna tell you god's going to give you amen god's going to give you nobody it can oh lord as i said that was on sunday what god blessed cain no man curse and what god cursed can't no man bless nobody can st take your blessings from you what god has ordained for you in your life you can stand ashore if i just stand and trust god and believe god it's going to come to pass amen i'm standing on the promises of god it doesn't matter who don't understand me who talk about me whatever come whatever goes god knows amen and you stand on his promises hold on to god's unchanging hands amen always stand for jesus and he'll stand for you amen man could bless you for a season amen with god's blessings for i wear whatever man can do for you man could catch you on the back and tell you you this and you that but that only lasts for a little season they can build a statue and a memorial and say this is this is this famous person what that means in eternity brother and sister let god whatever god has for you realizes it's a way to glorious in store for them to trust him to them that love them god has something in store for you god bless you let us stand appreciate the word tonight [Music] god is good let us bow father in jesus name oh god it's a little wild and jesus said you'll see me no more yet a little while you should see me for he said i'll be with you even in you so father god we thank you we thank you tonight lord that amen the writer says we have this tragedy in earthly business that the excellency of the power may be in god father thank you for the treasure that we have in earthly vessels thank you for the holy ghost tonight thank you for the power of god
