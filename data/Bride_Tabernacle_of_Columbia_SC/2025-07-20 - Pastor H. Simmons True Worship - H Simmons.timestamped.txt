[33:39] need, you can lift your hands to the
[33:42] Lord and say, "Lord, I have a need."
[33:45] Father, in Jesus name, we thank you. For
[33:48] Lord, we are needy people, Lord. And we
[33:52] know that you're God. And we know that
[33:54] you know all things. And Lord God, you
[33:57] know what we have need of before we even
[33:59] ask. But you said, "Ask and it shall be
[34:02] given. Seek and you shall find." You
[34:04] said, "Knock and the door shall be
[34:06] open." So father as we look to the heels
[34:09] now from which cometh our help we ask
[34:11] you to look upon every need you said but
[34:13] my God should supply all of your needs
[34:16] according to his riches and glory. So,
[34:18] Father, I ask you, oh God, to look upon
[34:20] the Breed families today, Lord. God,
[34:23] look upon the Carol family today, Lord.
[34:26] Pray your strength be with the sister
[34:27] Carol and family. God, I pray God that
[34:30] you'll move here today. Oh God, that you
[34:33] touch hearts, touch lives, Lord. You
[34:36] heal, you save, you deliver. Oh God, you
[34:39] meet every need, Lord, for we trusting
[34:41] in your unfailing word of promise. In
[34:44] Jesus Christ's wonderful name we pray.
[34:46] Amen.
[34:48] As we stand for the reading of the
[34:49] scripture, the book of St. John 4 and
[34:54] 19.
[34:56] St. John 4:19.
[35:00] As we continue on the truth, Amen. And
[35:03] what is truth? The true church, the
[35:06] false church. Amen.
[35:09] Talk this morning about true worship.
[35:15] And it says here,
[35:17] the woman said unto him, sir, I perceive
[35:20] that thou prophet,
[35:22] our fathers worship in this mountain,
[35:26] and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
[35:29] place where men ought to worship.
[35:33] Jesus said unto her,"Woman,
[35:36] believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
[35:40] shall neither in this mountain, nor at
[35:43] yet at Jerusalem worship the Father.
[35:48] Ye worship, ye know not what
[35:52] we know what we worship,
[35:56] for salvation is of the Jews.
[36:00] But the hour cometh,
[36:03] and now is, when the true worshippers
[36:07] shall worship the Father in spirit and
[36:10] in truth. For the Father seeketh such to
[36:15] worship him. God is a spirit
[36:19] and they that worship him
[36:25] and they that worship him must worship
[36:27] him in spirit and truth.
[36:31] The woman said unto him, I know
[36:35] that the Messiah cometh,
[36:37] which is called Christ, and and when he
[36:42] cometh, he will tell us all things.
[36:46] Jesus said unto her, I that speaketh
[36:50] unto thee am he. God bless and reach.
[36:54] You may be seated. Amen.
[36:58] Now we want to talk this morning
[37:00] concerning truth. Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Worshiping God's true worship. Amen.
[37:08] Now Jesus told that woman that
[37:12] they should worship him in spirit and
[37:14] truth. He said I will cometh and thy
[37:16] ears. See because in time past they had
[37:21] a certain place to worship. They had
[37:23] Jerusalem and they had the temple and
[37:26] then and other
[37:29] they had a certain
[37:31] ceremonial type worship. They bought the
[37:35] the animal the bulls and the sacrifices
[37:38] to the temple and it was all told them
[37:42] by Moses how you offer the sacrifice for
[37:45] sin and a sacrifice for free will
[37:48] offering and a sacrifice for this. So
[37:51] they had a form of worship that God had
[37:54] ordained for that particular time. So
[37:58] the they said so they knew Amen. And
[38:02] then uh the Samaritan which was part
[38:06] Amen uh Jew but
[38:10] they uh had a place in where Jacob built
[38:14] the well.
[38:16] And um they said, "Well, the woman was
[38:18] at that well that her father built in
[38:21] that mountain."
[38:23] Amen. And they worshiped God in that
[38:25] mountain. But it came a time and a place
[38:30] that God said, "You don't have to come
[38:32] to this mountain, neither Jerusalem, but
[38:35] the hour cometh, and now is that the
[38:38] true worshippers going to worship God in
[38:40] spirit and truth." Amen.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; So it come a time where Amen. God was
[38:46] moving from ceremonial worship to God
[38:50] was going to move. Amen. That you're
[38:52] going to worship me in spirit now
[38:54] because all the time it was physical and
[38:57] outseen and they could see amen the
[38:59] animals. They could see the high priest.
[39:02] But now it comes time that God was
[39:04] calling for spirit and truth.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. You know people are not uh ready
[39:10] to change. People don't want to change.
[39:13] If we if it was good enough for mama,
[39:15] good enough for grandmama, great
[39:17] grandmama, it good enough for us. And
[39:20] you know what? Even we have a certain
[39:23] men that we know God really used in a
[39:27] powerful way. We have Moses, we have
[39:29] Abraham, we have people that Amen. that
[39:31] God ordained and God used. Now look
[39:35] here.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; You said this is not good enough. You
[39:39] know, when it comes down to God question
[39:42] uh how we worship sometime we want to uh
[39:45] you know say God you knowh
[39:49] I've been worshiping this way all the
[39:51] time. How come you going to change it?
[39:54] Amen. See sometimes as I said on other
[39:58] occasion with this messages concerning
[40:01] truth. I said now people have their own
[40:04] truth.
[40:05] This is the way I believe it. Amen. They
[40:08] can tell God, you can take it or leave
[40:10] it cuz this is the way I believe. So it
[40:14] doesn't matter what the word says. Amen.
[40:18] Uh Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth,
[40:20] and the life." Paul said, "What is
[40:23] truth?"
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So people have their own truth.
[40:28] Amen. And they have their own form of
[40:30] worship.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. People Amen. Some people Amen.
[40:36] Over in India they pray to the sun and
[40:39] sometimes their eyes become blind and
[40:42] the Hindu they have so many uh gods and
[40:46] maybe a million different gods and
[40:48] sometime they don't eat meat or anything
[40:50] like that if they really really Hindu
[40:55] because they believe in reincarnation
[40:58] that uh maybe that's if I kill a roach
[41:01] that might be one of my cousins
[41:04] uh you know and I can't eat certain
[41:07] things because uh Amen. We believe that
[41:11] you leave here, you come back maybe as a
[41:13] cow and and the cow is very sacred. So
[41:17] we can't eat no hamburger. Okay. So um
[41:21] people but that's what that's how they
[41:23] worship God. They and and and the Muslim
[41:27] they they they look towards, you know,
[41:31] uh praying three times a day and a a and
[41:34] they're faithful at it and you can't
[41:36] stop them because that's their form of
[41:39] worship.
[41:40] And I'm going tell you something. As I
[41:42] said in Sunday school this morning,
[41:44] sometime those people outdo you
[41:49] &gt;&gt; and their in their worship and Amen.
[41:52] Sometimes they they can stand and for
[41:55] hours and those people are faithful,
[41:58] you know, and people say we got truth
[42:00] and we're really genuine Christians. But
[42:04] yet in in reality, Amen. They give God
[42:08] the less
[42:10] of them all.
[42:12] But when we said worship God in spirit
[42:15] and in truth, what are you saying? Amen.
[42:18] Because Amen. They had a form and it was
[42:21] required that they should do it a
[42:24] certain way and it had been established
[42:27] by Moses who God gave it to him.
[42:31] But yet God was changing their worship.
[42:36] He was changing what amen they were used
[42:39] to and he was moving away from the uh
[42:42] the natural temple saying all these
[42:45] things was just shadows.
[42:47] Amen. This was shadows and it was a type
[42:50] of what was to come.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when Jesus Messiah come, that
[42:57] woman recognized that when the Messiah
[42:59] come, Amen. He'll tell us all things.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll tell us what we need to be
[43:06] doing and how to do it.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; So, she recognized he see because Jesus
[43:12] asked the woman, he said, "Uh, you know,
[43:15] you at this?" He said, "Go on, go get
[43:17] your husband." The woman said, "I have
[43:20] none."
[43:22] And Jesus said, "You said,"Well, because
[43:25] you had five husbands,
[43:28] and the one you shacking up with is not
[43:30] your husband."
[43:32] And she said, "Huh?"
[43:34] And she said,
[43:38] "Sir,
[43:40] I perceive that you're a prophet.
[43:44] I I know that when the Messiah come,
[43:48] he'll tell us these things. And Jesus
[43:52] just flat out and told her, "He that
[43:54] speaketh with you am he."
[43:58] Are you with me? He let her know who he
[44:02] was.
[44:03] But the Pharisees when they saw him,
[44:06] they had their own ecclesiastical,
[44:09] Amen. custom type. They have been set
[44:12] in. And they were solid on what they
[44:15] believe and they were sticking to it. So
[44:17] when Jesus come they were knew that yes
[44:21] if the Messiah come he must be a
[44:24] Pharisee. Then you had to sell your
[44:27] seeds. Amen. Say if God if the Messiah
[44:31] come we all ready for him. We done
[44:34] taught the people how the Messiah would
[44:36] come. If he come he going to be a sused
[44:40] you see.
[44:42] And so the people were amen in the
[44:44] expectation for him to come. Whether you
[44:47] were fire seed or sused, they know the
[44:50] Messiah was to come.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; But when he come they they they united
[44:56] together and they all perceived that he
[44:59] was
[45:01] the prince of devils.
[45:04] See? Amen. The true worshippers
[45:08] going to worship God in spirit and in
[45:10] truth.
[45:11] Amen. And the only way you're going to
[45:14] know who the Messiah is, Amen, he has to
[45:17] reveal it to you.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want a savior to save you from
[45:23] your sin.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; You want Amen. Uh the the the uh the
[45:28] Lord to help you.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want the Lord Amen. to give
[45:34] you the kingdom of heaven and to eternal
[45:38] life. But you got to recognize who he
[45:40] is.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; But as long as we got our confidence in
[45:45] our church, in our preacher, Amen. And
[45:49] things like that, Amen. We may miss out
[45:52] on Jesus.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Because we already been taught how to
[45:57] think.
[45:59] Amen. What to look for when he come, how
[46:02] he would come. So we already got that.
[46:06] Oh, I know. when he come, he going to
[46:08] come. Amen. In a certain way. And you
[46:12] know, I I I I was praying this morning
[46:16] and I said, you know, so it's a shame.
[46:21] It's a shame before God and we offer God
[46:25] the our worship like we sometimes like
[46:28] we come and we offer God our worship and
[46:32] we want to know will your worship be
[46:35] accepted
[46:37] will what you giving God as a Christian
[46:40] and as a born again believer if will it
[46:44] be acceptable in God's sight are you
[46:47] with me true worship true is it True. Is
[46:52] it sincere? Are you honest? Are you
[46:55] really all in?
[46:58] Praise God.
[47:00] I seen, you know, in the natural, I seen
[47:04] uh
[47:05] when I played sports, I seen football
[47:07] players that were, you know, they were
[47:10] just playing. I mean, they they they
[47:13] just played around. But I saw
[47:17] my junior year guys were big 250.
[47:23] Oh, big guys. And they were bigger.
[47:27] Look like they ought to be stronger.
[47:29] Look like they were old men almost.
[47:32] And look like they would have had it all
[47:35] together. Are you with me? But those
[47:38] guys, they were kind of they were more
[47:42] into the girls and uh most of them got
[47:44] married almost before they got out of
[47:46] high school. I mean, as soon as they got
[47:49] out cuz they looked like they were old
[47:51] men,
[47:53] but the football team wasn't that good.
[47:57] The next year, you know, senior year,
[48:00] guys look, they weren't so big. got a
[48:03] few big guys, but looked like the
[48:06] people, they were excited and they were
[48:08] all in
[48:10] and
[48:12] I look like we went undefeated in the
[48:15] state of South Carolina and one tie
[48:17] game. But
[48:22] you saw the difference when people were
[48:25] uh uh together on one accord, they want
[48:29] to accomplish something. You know when
[48:31] we come together. Amen. The Bible said
[48:33] when two or three are gathered in my
[48:35] name, he said I'll be in the midst.
[48:37] Ain't that right?
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're talking about excited people.
[48:42] You know the excited people are the poor
[48:45] people.
[48:47] The poor people seem to get more out of
[48:50] worship than the people that God ble
[48:53] look like they got all the blessings,
[48:55] but they won't give God back.
[48:58] or you know they they won't they won't
[49:00] give God what he asks of them. They
[49:03] won't praise God cuz they got they got a
[49:06] nice house, they got a nice car, they
[49:08] make good money, but when it come down
[49:10] to worship, look like they because they
[49:13] got everything, they don't they they
[49:15] don't want to give God praise.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; They don't thank God enough.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they they they got it all.
[49:24] So they give him Amen. a form of
[49:27] worship.
[49:29] God don't want formality.
[49:33] God wants uh worship that comes from
[49:36] sincerity.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; And he want worship from your heart.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; You know, we can all I I can we can all
[49:45] get pumped up. Everybody ought to praise
[49:47] the Lord. You ought to get up. You all
[49:49] to get up on your seat and everybody can
[49:51] get to jumping and we can say let's give
[49:53] praise uh uh music for about a minute
[49:56] about two minutes in here and organ
[50:00] everybody can get to dancing it which is
[50:03] all right
[50:05] that people can be sincere
[50:08] but I want to know amen are we doing it
[50:11] just because we asked to do it are we
[50:15] doing it because this is the way the
[50:17] church do it or are we doing it because
[50:21] amen there's spontaneous praise. We know
[50:24] what God requires.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; We know God wants to be worship
[50:31] &gt;&gt; and I want to give him what he asked
[50:33] for.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; David says, "Amen. Praise God. If I had
[50:38] 10,000 tongues, it wouldn't be
[50:40] sufficient enough to praise God like I
[50:43] want to."
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to worship. Amen. And
[50:47] it says, "Make a charge for noise unto
[50:50] the Lord. Serve the Lord with gladness."
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the people, I can't, what am I
[50:57] glad about? I'm glad he saved me.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he saved me.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; I can worship God because I'm glad.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be saved.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be a Christian.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to worship God. I want to
[51:17] show him how much I appreciate what he's
[51:20] done for me and what he's doing in my
[51:23] life. I want to say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[51:27] Lord, I love you and I appreciate
[51:30] because you're good."
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "He good and his mercy
[51:35] endureth forever. I love the Lord
[51:39] because you heard my cry."
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; True worship. Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; True worship ought to be sincere
[51:50] worship.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; People Amen. I believe they sing and I
[51:58] believe they
[52:01] they they they play music and all and
[52:05] what is the sincerity?
[52:08] He said spirit and are you sincere?
[52:12] Because once they get through singing,
[52:16] the chatting and the on the phone,
[52:21] huh?
[52:23] They tune God out.
[52:26] They're not all in.
[52:28] Where is the sincerity?
[52:31] When in your worship, you ought to be
[52:33] sincere. I come to worship God. And God
[52:37] eyes are on the sparrow. He watches over
[52:40] us. He sees everything we do. He sees
[52:42] even what we think.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So if I'm a worship
[52:47] God, God knows whether or not I'm all in
[52:49] or whether or not I'm just faking it.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; But when I'm all in, I'm mean. I'm here,
[52:55] but I'm here to please God. I'm here to
[52:58] worship God.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; I want what I do to please him. Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; You ain't all the time got to jump up
[53:05] and shout and dance, but you got to you
[53:08] got to be sincere.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; You need to be sincere and you need to
[53:14] feel like when I wave my hand and
[53:18] Lord, I'm waving it in Jesus' name. And
[53:21] Lord, I want my worship. Somebody said
[53:24] my worship is for real. I don't know
[53:27] about them, but you know what I'm
[53:29] saying. I want mine to be real.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; How about you? When when I praise God, I
[53:36] want I I'm doing it because I love you.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; I I Nobody got to make me do it. I want
[53:42] to do it.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; I want to tell God thank you.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:48] Thank you, Lord. I don't mind telling
[53:51] him thank you.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:57] Somebody they sung the other night. And
[53:59] I don't want no rocks
[54:02] uh you know to cry out. I don't want the
[54:04] rocks to praise him for me.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want no bird.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That what they said. They didn't
[54:12] want no bird.
[54:16] I don't want no bird to take my place.
[54:19] Are you with me?
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't want the trees to
[54:23] take my place.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; I want to I I want to do what I supposed
[54:27] to do.
[54:28] I I want God to say yes. Yes, I'm
[54:30] pleased with it.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, Lord, amen. Thank
[54:34] you, Jesus.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; We talk about worshiping
[54:39] and in spirit in truth. We talking about
[54:41] true worship. Amen. Praise God. When you
[54:44] got when when you when you mean what
[54:46] you're doing,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; you know, not not just doing it cuz Oh,
[54:50] I believe I sing a song today.
[54:53] Keep it.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; We don't need it.
[54:58] This ain't no showing, no performing. We
[55:00] ain't coming to no beauty contest.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to worship God.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to give God praise,
[55:08] don't I ain't going to make you.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you It's all right to
[55:12] praise God if you want to.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; If you think he's worthy of it, if if
[55:18] you think God deserve it and you think
[55:20] God is worth it, it's all right to give
[55:23] it to him. But if you think God, you
[55:26] know, Yeah. Yeah. Somebody said, "Well,
[55:29] I don't know." You got people out
[55:31] praising you, out dancing in the spirit,
[55:34] and they ain't living like the devil.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Well, thank God."
[55:40] Hallelujah.
[55:42] Worship God in what?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Spirit and truth.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:47] In spirit and truth. Amen. That it ought
[55:51] to be a life behind your worship. It
[55:53] ought to be a revelation. I believe
[55:55] we're missing the revelation of worship.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; I believe the reason why we worship like
[56:01] we worship because we're missing it. You
[56:04] know, I was just in a big convention
[56:07] down in Louisiana. It was, you know,
[56:10] looked like a 1500,000
[56:13] over well over a thousand people there.
[56:15] And I I seen those people. They stood on
[56:18] their feet. They was jumping and
[56:20] everything was all hoof. They had that
[56:23] thing together. Amen. And see, we got
[56:25] the new kind of worship. We got the
[56:28] lights and everything going and you
[56:30] know, look like a nightclub and
[56:32] everybody got to jump. Are you with me?
[56:35] Y'all seen that new kind of worship? The
[56:37] church look like a nightclub and
[56:39] everybody got the music going and
[56:41] everybody know what they supposed to do.
[56:44] See, I I I
[56:47] refuse it.
[56:50] I refuse to amen put on a great a a big
[56:54] show and a and everybody come to know
[56:57] what they got to do.
[56:59] You got to Amen. worship God in spirit
[57:02] and truth. You're sincere
[57:06] from your heart.
[57:09] You giving God. I said, "Lord, do I
[57:11] think about it?" Sometime we ain't
[57:14] thinking you know really you know
[57:16] sometimes in your prayer life you don't
[57:19] approach God right because you just
[57:21] going through the motion and you just
[57:23] praying saying things but when you
[57:25] really down to bit I'm tell you
[57:26] something you have a real genuine need a
[57:30] life and death situation or a very
[57:33] crucial need in your life you ain't
[57:35] going to be s I'm Lord I thank you for
[57:39] no you you going to get down there and
[57:41] tell him what you really need.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You going you going to get
[57:45] desperate.
[57:47] Lord, I I you going to get sincere.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The doctor come to telling you you
[57:53] got an incurable disease and you going
[57:56] you got got a a five maybe five months
[58:00] to live and you get down there and you
[58:02] pray different cuz the doctor done told
[58:05] you you ain't got much time.
[58:08] But as long as you think you all right,
[58:13] your prayer might say, "Lord, I thank
[58:16] you for another day. Lord, watch over me
[58:18] today. Thank you, Jesus. Bye."
[58:22] I believe we got to be more sincere.
[58:26] We got to wait sometimes on the
[58:28] anointing.
[58:29] Wait on the presence to come.
[58:32] God, what would you have me to say? But
[58:36] what would you have me to know?
[58:39] I don't want to go through the motion in
[58:41] prayer, but I want to I want to pray
[58:43] right
[58:45] because I know God, you can tell me
[58:47] something. I need you can lead me. You
[58:50] can guide me. I want to know that you're
[58:52] speaking to my heart. Lord, I want to
[58:55] know, Amen. Amen. That God is in this
[59:01] this day. You know I if you in a
[59:06] crossroad right now in your life
[59:10] in that crossroad in your life
[59:13] and you asking God for direction and
[59:15] guidance
[59:20] you got to move out the way. Don't ask
[59:23] God for what you want,
[59:26] but God,
[59:28] you know what I need. Because once
[59:32] you've already put in your mind that I'm
[59:35] in a crossroad
[59:38] and asking God for direction,
[59:41] but I already put in my mind what I what
[59:45] I want. And it and if it don't come that
[59:49] way, I believe God don't ain't didn't
[59:51] hear me. He's not listening to me. I I
[59:54] know I because I asked him, Amen. to
[59:57] direct me and to guide me. Yet, I had my
[1:00:01] I I already in my spirit. I already had
[1:00:04] in my mind what I wanted. You see what
[1:00:07] I'm saying? See, God bypass you. He's
[1:00:11] telling you, I want you out of the way.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want me to do it, then you
[1:00:18] get out the way and let me do what I
[1:00:22] want to do. Let me lead you.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me direct your
[1:00:28] path.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I'm God and you ask me to
[1:00:32] do it, then get out the way.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Speaking to somebody.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; God is a good God.
[1:00:46] True worshippers.
[1:00:52] See, we want power more than form.
[1:00:57] See, sometimes we want a form of
[1:00:59] godliness.
[1:01:02] Spirit and in truth. Worship God in
[1:01:06] spirit and in truth.
[1:01:09] We want form
[1:01:12] more than power.
[1:01:15] Are you with me?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You ought to want the power of God. Not
[1:01:21] a form of godliness, but I want God's
[1:01:25] power.
[1:01:27] God, I want you to come down as you
[1:01:30] consume the offering for Elijah. And you
[1:01:34] were able to confirm that you were God.
[1:01:38] I want you to confirm my worship.
[1:01:42] Oh Lord, by sending your anointing, your
[1:01:46] in vindication,
[1:01:48] God, I need you to come down. And Lord,
[1:01:52] if my worship is accepted by you, then
[1:01:56] come, Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me know that
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; that you're pleased with it.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:07] I believe
[1:02:09] what we do for the Lord and how we
[1:02:12] worship God,
[1:02:15] how is our attitude,
[1:02:17] right?
[1:02:20] Do we think we doing God a service?
[1:02:24] Do we think are we doing it because
[1:02:26] you're saying thank you, Lord? Are are
[1:02:30] we thinking that, "Oh, Lord, look, I'm
[1:02:33] doing this for you. Our
[1:02:38] worship ought to be
[1:02:41] something that we giving back what he's
[1:02:43] given to us. Are you with me? Lord, what
[1:02:47] you gave to me, I want to give it back.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So God gives us life.
[1:02:53] God gives us breath. See, he said
[1:02:55] everything with breath ought to what?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Because our breath don't come just
[1:03:00] because, Amen. we decided to wake up
[1:03:03] this morning. It comes from the Lord. So
[1:03:05] everything with breath ought to
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; But people got breath, but they're not
[1:03:10] what?
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; And and that's what I'm saying. Don't
[1:03:16] think, you know, I had so many gifted
[1:03:19] people. And I've seen so many people
[1:03:21] that were so gifted and so mightily used
[1:03:24] by God, but they they began to think
[1:03:27] that what I'm doing, I'm being used.
[1:03:32] Sometimes some of the beautiful voices
[1:03:35] and some of the most gifted musicians
[1:03:38] will think that if you're not paying me
[1:03:41] $500 to $1,000 that I'm being used.
[1:03:45] If we say, "Thank you, brother, sister.
[1:03:47] I really appreciate you." That's not
[1:03:50] enough.
[1:03:51] Amen. Because down the street they
[1:03:53] giving $500 a Sunday and over there they
[1:03:57] giving $1,000. I I'm trying to see.
[1:04:00] Amen. What I can get. See, but you got
[1:04:03] to be able to worship God. Amen. Not
[1:04:07] because in what you do, don't you think
[1:04:10] that you're doing God a favor? Amen.
[1:04:13] When you praise God, don't you think
[1:04:15] you're doing God a favor. It ought to
[1:04:16] be, Amen. Lord, I thank you because I
[1:04:19] appreciate you. I thank you because I
[1:04:22] love you. I thank you because I want to
[1:04:25] praise you. Amen. I worship the Lord.
[1:04:30] Amen. I want to give him everything I
[1:04:32] got.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; I ain't got enough. I I And I haven't
[1:04:36] done enough for the Lord.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; I to show how much I appreciate him.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I I don't understand
[1:04:43] how people get tired. Amen. O of doing
[1:04:47] for the Lord and doing things for the
[1:04:49] Lord. I don't understand, especially
[1:04:53] young people. I don't understand. I'm so
[1:04:55] tired. I I didn't get died, man. We We
[1:04:59] barely got a few hours sleep out there
[1:05:01] witnessing, going from city to city,
[1:05:03] knocking on doors, preaching in the
[1:05:06] street sometimes. Amen. Talking to the
[1:05:08] down and out and those that didn't have
[1:05:10] it. Amen. Those that were Amen. It was
[1:05:13] something about that. Your worship, true
[1:05:16] worship.
[1:05:18] Amen. You got to be, you want to witness
[1:05:21] for the Lord. It's something when you
[1:05:24] receive the Holy Ghost. After the Holy
[1:05:26] Ghost, you will have power and you shall
[1:05:28] be witnesses of me. You got a testimony.
[1:05:31] You want to tell somebody about Jesus.
[1:05:34] That's all a form of you worshiping God.
[1:05:37] Not just coming to church clapping your
[1:05:39] hand, not just singing a song. Amen. But
[1:05:42] your whole life becomes a life of
[1:05:45] continual worship. Everything I do,
[1:05:49] everything. Hallelujah. I wanted to be
[1:05:51] pleasing and acceptable in God's sight.
[1:05:54] Amen. I'm worshiping God when I'm
[1:05:56] walking and when I'm working. Amen. When
[1:05:58] I'm exercising, I'm worshiping God.
[1:06:01] Lord, I'm saying thank you. Praise God.
[1:06:03] Some of the best time to worship God
[1:06:05] when you're walking. Get some exercise.
[1:06:09] Thanking the Lord. Hallelujah. I can
[1:06:12] sing then and nobody laugh at me cuz I'm
[1:06:15] just singing to the Lord out there by
[1:06:18] myself. You see what I'm saying? your
[1:06:21] worship
[1:06:23] and the presence of God comes and I feel
[1:06:26] his goodness. Sometimes I just speak in
[1:06:29] tongues a little while and I just thank
[1:06:32] the Lord for just showering out his
[1:06:35] mercy and his glory upon them. Y'all
[1:06:37] ought to try. God will meet you anywhere
[1:06:41] at any time if you start looking at what
[1:06:45] God has done for you and what he's doing
[1:06:47] in your life. God will meet you.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Worship God in spirit and in truth.
[1:07:00] I hope I said enough.
[1:07:04] I want you to worship God, right?
[1:07:06] Remember,
[1:07:09] we don't turn God on, turn him off. We
[1:07:12] don't say, "Hey,
[1:07:15] this is the way you got to do it. This
[1:07:18] is the way you I want you to do it.
[1:07:20] Everybody trying to do the same thing.
[1:07:25] God might tell you to do a little
[1:07:26] something different.
[1:07:29] I think my children say, "Daddy,
[1:07:31] everybody shout the same way, dance the
[1:07:34] same way."
[1:07:35] I think uh maybe maybe that was over to
[1:07:38] the house and some of the older people
[1:07:41] were talking about sisters and all. They
[1:07:45] said, "No, they used to people used to
[1:07:47] dance in different ways. Everybody
[1:07:49] didn't shout a lack or get in the spirit
[1:07:52] the same way. Some people jump up and
[1:07:55] down. Some people had a certain dance
[1:07:57] and other person had a certain dance.
[1:08:00] The Holy Ghost is just moving. People
[1:08:02] get to dancing and shouting and the Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost is just move all over the church
[1:08:07] and the people. Amen. But now everybody
[1:08:10] doing get your part and let's come on.
[1:08:16] Sometime it's all right. I ain't going
[1:08:18] to say that. But lots of time we just we
[1:08:23] just working up something.
[1:08:26] We just trying to do something that we
[1:08:28] work up and because we got all sweaty
[1:08:30] and because we got Amen. got a good
[1:08:33] exercise, workout, we think that God,
[1:08:37] it's it's pleasing. It's acceptable to
[1:08:40] God. And I want to tell you, not all the
[1:08:43] time.
[1:08:45] See, because Cain knew that what he was
[1:08:49] doing, it should have been accepted.
[1:08:52] And Abel, what he was doing, it didn't
[1:08:54] look good. It wasn't pretty. But he
[1:08:57] offered up, Amen, a more excellent
[1:08:59] sacrifice than that of Cain.
[1:09:02] Amen. He took a bloody lamb and he
[1:09:04] slaved and he offered up blood.
[1:09:08] But Cain offered up the fruits of the
[1:09:10] field and he got all the little pretty
[1:09:13] flowers and everything look good.
[1:09:16] But God, it wasn't acceptable.
[1:09:19] And sometimes that's the way some you
[1:09:22] know you you know God you ought to be
[1:09:24] glad
[1:09:26] that I I I could I sing a song. No. No.
[1:09:31] Let's not get the wrong kind of
[1:09:32] attitude. Be humble. Be meek. Be kind.
[1:09:36] And worship God in spirit and truth. And
[1:09:39] know that the true worshippers know that
[1:09:41] they they're not even worthy of God's
[1:09:45] grace and God love and kindness. I I
[1:09:49] don't even deserve it. I I'm not even
[1:09:52] worthy of it.
[1:09:55] Jesus, you died
[1:09:58] on that cross and you took my sins and
[1:10:01] you bear them in your own body.
[1:10:04] You bled. You were spit on. You had the
[1:10:07] power to call 12 legion of angels. But
[1:10:10] you didn't. You hung there for me. You
[1:10:13] died for me.
[1:10:15] You died for my sins.
[1:10:19] When I should have went to hell, you
[1:10:21] went there for me.
[1:10:24] He took my place
[1:10:27] on an old rugged cross.
[1:10:30] Didn't have to do it, but he did. And
[1:10:34] I'm glad he did.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Brother and sister, when you think about
[1:10:40] your worship,
[1:10:42] is it true worship?
[1:10:46] Is it from your heart?
[1:10:49] Does God deserve your worship?
[1:10:52] Do you want to give God back what he's
[1:10:55] given to you? He gave his life.
[1:10:58] He gave his life for you
[1:11:02] that you can turn around and all you all
[1:11:04] he asks of you to thank him.
[1:11:08] Thank him for what he's done.
[1:11:13] But in turn, what do we do?
[1:11:18] When we do worship, we think we're doing
[1:11:20] God a favor.
[1:11:27] I want you to be all in.
[1:11:33] David realized
[1:11:37] his birth was born in sin shaped in
[1:11:39] iniquity.
[1:11:41] And we realized that
[1:11:44] that God called him to be king
[1:11:48] when he was just a little boy
[1:11:51] minding the sheep.
[1:11:54] I wasn't worthy of God's mercy and
[1:11:56] grace, but he came and got me.
[1:12:01] I don't know where you were when he came
[1:12:03] and spoke to your heart.
[1:12:05] when he came to get you. What? I don't
[1:12:07] know where you were, what you were
[1:12:09] doing.
[1:12:11] When Jesus stopped by,
[1:12:15] let you know he was savior. He was Lord.
[1:12:18] Let you know how much he loved you and
[1:12:20] how much he cared about you.
[1:12:24] Don't never forget
[1:12:27] the love of God and what he's done for
[1:12:29] you.
[1:12:32] Don't never get caught up.
[1:12:35] looking at others
[1:12:38] and looking at things.
[1:12:41] Keep your eyes
[1:12:44] on Jesus.
[1:12:47] Let your worship be true,
[1:12:50] honesty, sincere
[1:12:54] that it would please God.
[1:12:56] I'm not worried about pleasing the
[1:12:58] preacher, the church, or men. I want to
[1:13:01] please God.
[1:13:04] I want it to come from my heart.
[1:13:07] This is what I want to give back cuz I
[1:13:10] know Jesus is good to me.
[1:13:15] Sometime you just whistle a prayer
[1:13:19] not knowing God.
[1:13:23] Thank you. Let us bow our heads. Thank
[1:13:25] you. Let us bow our heads.
[1:13:34] Sometimes we forget.
[1:13:37] Sometimes we are not mindful.
[1:13:42] Sometimes
[1:13:44] we go through the motion.
[1:13:48] I know I'm guilty sometimes.
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:54] But we got to focus.
[1:13:59] Focus on
[1:14:02] the true and living God.
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:06] The God that does
[1:14:09] all things well.
[1:14:12] Care more about us than we care about
[1:14:14] ourselves.
[1:14:17] Loved us unconditionally.
[1:14:24] Thank you for having mercy on me.
[1:14:28] Thank you for caring when I didn't know
[1:14:30] where I should turn and what to do with
[1:14:33] my life. God
[1:14:38] didn't know where I was going and where
[1:14:40] I would end up. Lord,
[1:14:45] just a young boy trying to find myself.
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:51] Why? Where am I going? and what am I
[1:14:53] going to do in my life?
[1:14:57] You came by.
[1:15:00] You saw me there. Lord,
[1:15:03] you saw that I needed a savior. You
[1:15:06] thought that I needed somebody
[1:15:10] give me purpose
[1:15:13] to give me purpose. Lord, I needed
[1:15:15] purpose for living. I needed someone
[1:15:20] something that I can believe in. I can
[1:15:22] trust
[1:15:27] Lord maybe Lord
[1:15:31] somebody he hears
[1:15:33] come to the turning point
[1:15:36] come to the cross road
[1:15:40] they need
[1:15:44] give their hearts to you
[1:15:48] Lord of you
[1:15:50] if God has spoke to your heart this
[1:15:52] morning.
[1:15:55] Give him opportunity
[1:15:57] to come in and s with you.
[1:16:02] Lord, I know you died for me.
[1:16:06] I need you now.
[1:16:09] How many would we just lift your hands?
[1:16:11] Lord, I need you right now. Thank you.
[1:16:13] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:16:17] right now. Lord,
[1:16:19] I want to welcome your presence. Lord,
[1:16:24] I want to get into sincerity. I want
[1:16:27] your minds to get on the Lord Jesus.
[1:16:33] Ask him to meet your need now.
[1:16:38] Ask him to do something, Lord, with my
[1:16:41] life, God, because I can't lead myself.
[1:16:47] God, here I am. God,
[1:16:50] guide me, Lord. Lead me, oh great
[1:16:54] Jehovah.
[1:16:56] I need your help this morning. I need

[1:25:06] Oh yes Lord
[1:25:08] said I will. I will.

[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:26:05] Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for all of our
[1:26:14] visitors.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; If any of the visitors would like to say
[1:26:17] anything, we give you a moment to say
[1:26:19] anything. You just want to tell the Lord
[1:26:21] thank you. Any visitor want to say
[1:26:23] anything?
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for y'all. May you come
[1:26:31] back and be with us. We trust that
[1:26:33] you've been blessed. I want to say to
[1:26:36] everyone, we have a fellowship meal over
[1:26:40] next door. You're welcome to the
[1:26:42] fellowship meal next door. You don't
[1:26:45] have to go home and cook.
[1:26:48] you can go over and get something to
[1:26:51] eat.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Let us just bow. Father, we thank you
[1:26:59] for this day that you made Lord and pray
[1:27:02] you just bless everyone that have come.
[1:27:06] And Lord, as we leave this place,
[1:27:08] whenever your presence, may your angels
[1:27:11] watch over us. May your blood cover us.
[1:27:14] May you keep us in your name. And
[1:27:16] father,
[1:27:19] thank you for the food that's been
[1:27:20] prepared, the hands that prepared it.
[1:27:23] May, oh God, that you bless it, sanctify
[1:27:26] it in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:29] And Lord, may you get all the glory, all
[1:27:31] the praise, and thank you for your
[1:27:34] children, Lord, everyone that press
[1:27:37] their way this day. Lord, may your
[1:27:39] blessings be upon everyone.
[1:27:42] May the Lord watch between me and thee.
[1:27:45] While we absent one from another, let us
[1:27:48] all say amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
