following good ground before the fools of God in Cape Fear of Honor all the glory on the praise and realize they know someone had never given their life let this be the daily years they hit it with the day they hit the voice of God hard not their horses years but we thank God for grace and mercy Christ's name we say amen amen amen amen open the Bible is it being Proverbs 16 and 7. thank God for the musicians amen praise friends sound good in here they're not even an amen truly it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen so Proverbs 16 and 7. amen then we read second Timothy two three and four then we end up in Hebrews 11 5 and 6 amen so I'm having thank God for the words naughty man the infallible word of God Amen praise God some Proverbs amen kind of nervous but you know you want to be nervous when he coming man amen and step on the scene amen proverbs Proverbs 16 and verse 7. 16-7 says when a man's way pleases the Lord he make even his enemies to bear peace with him in Reverse eight better is a little of a righteousness than great revenues without rights amen also second Timothy 2 second Timothy two Timothy two read the verse three through four second Timothy chapter 2 verse three through four says that thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ and no man that wolf entangled himself with their fears of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier amen last one Hebrews 11. Hebrews with heaven praise God he was 11 verse 5 and 6. and we know Enoch is our typing man he was the seventh of Adam and Eva and Enoch is the type of the Bride end time bride so it says by faith me not was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before this testimony for for his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith was impossible to please him he that cometh to God must believe that he is and his rewardeth him that literally seek Him may God be sure he's worried to maybe see United man amen I was torn between two messes amen I wasn't pre going on to Perfection man but I want to talk about pleasing God tonight amen I want to please God not a man and they went in the Bible say without faith is impossible to please him amen but realizing is all that this is a time where we must make our calling and elections sure amen let's know we are we are we must know that we have come into a place and coming to a time where this is our seasoning man you must come into the place of Our Lives we must swear we ought to manifested word for the day man and realize it and through all the midst of his trials and tribulations uh what we're going through man we know God gonna make everything work out for our good amen see a True Believer no they don't care what come up go God go work it out for me man see if you if we ain't guessing we ain't hoping I said I ain't guessing about God I ain't hoping I know God Amen and you know God but Revelation and Revelation has been revealed personally to you amen so he told Peter say Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell should not Prevail against what the revelation God not you not but to remember your pastor can't give you the Revelation Revelation come from God Amen but the word your pastor preached can get can take you to that revelation we're not here to get you to a church we're here to get you to God Amen and once you meet Christ you will never be the same again amen the main thing with the main purpose we want to meet Christ amen and Christ is the word amen so in his time of living they know you know we see we see so many things uh you see it's so much turmer than land we see so many so many uh so many people uh are following me but the Bible say we're having all the words must be fulfilled somebody gotta make the word live but I'm looking how many I'm Gonna Make the World say I'm gonna take a Rapture man see I I I I I I would say I didn't come this far to turn around Jesus said hey I believe he didn't bring me this far to lose me man because a child of God cannot be lost amen because we were like before you even stepped on this Earth before you before you even came uh it may flesh you was a thought in God's mind and before there was a day before there was a star before there was a world God said but the Bible says he put your name on the lands book a life amen before the foundation of the world Amen so because someone so when God does something he does something perfect amen God don't remember God Don't Make No mistake amen see he called you before he before me when God called you he knew he would have he knew you could make mistakes he knew you would have faults and failures but but he didn't call your face he called the gene a Godly Man see God the word don't come quick remember the Bible says data in the flesh cannot please God you walk in the flesh you'll never please God because your flesh is an enemy against Gods that's why you got to be born again and once you're born again you become a new creature and Christ say man good morning you know more you know more the old person now you're a new creature in Christ same man but you got to meet God first amen it amazes me how people can come in the message can say they believe the word ain't even born again huh because you ain't careful you can hear you can hear quotes you get quote you remember you can quote the Bible and still don't know God because if I say the letter killer but in spirit giving life a man describe the Pharisees knew the Bible backward and forwards but when they met their word they caught a bad word they said they believe they call them but yells above because they had an intellectual Faith they had an intellect intellectual knowledge about God they knew it by memorization we don't serve God but remember we serve God by Revelation demand because I quote this the quote must become a reality man the quote must become a life and that's the life of God coming with this life you're living is not your life positive the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God who love me it's not you positive it's no longer I delivered but Christ delivers me amen so if you live in this life you're gonna treat one day something is not gonna make you fall amen but if Christ is inside you you will never fall a man because he is the wording so I look how that the Bible says without faith is impossible to please God but faith is a revelation and Bible says faith come by hearing and hearing the word of God and so once you hear the word the word transform you into what the word says you can be then the Bible said Abraham stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief he don't care hey remember how many I mean how many children are not a man and you're you're a child of Abraham by being born again or the seat or the sea the true see Jesus Christ amen anybody said Abraham stack it not at the promise of God the longer God took the stronger Abraham got because Abraham was not lean on his flesh he wanted he wasn't either way he he could do he was lean on what God word said what could be done and when Once God's word come I go forth it cannot return void now if God say you heal you heal him if God see you back and bride if God say you're gonna make it you're gonna make it a man you don't look at what you see with your eyes you look by faith amen so Abraham about said he staggered not at the promise of God he didn't get weaker Saints he got stronger that's a lot of times the bribes I thought I ain't tired yet some people that start running and they got tired now it's amazing how they don't you know you don't run this far you can how they can see the finish line I can sit there you can you can see the feeling and you want to turn and what you gonna turn back to amen I come too far to turn around now man I got to go early man hit people turn around my faith was not tired of people who turn around my faith was in God so if you turn around ain't got nothing to do with me amen cause I'm tied to God and wife don't go I still because it's not me and wife it's me and God it's not me and children me and brother man is you and God Amen God ain't got no grandchildren you must know God for yourself you can't pick it back on this thing man you must know God for yourself amen so it amazing way where people where some people they they serving they certainly they serve God for a long time and somebody somebody they know stop serving God and it affects their walk that shows you ain't got you a true revelation because the Bible tells me the Bible said Enoch walk with God DK what his wife done they came with children done either had his one mind I'ma please God in the morning and once he had that mindset God said there's a man right here he's a candidate he's the world ain't worth nothing I'ma show the people in 2023 they're just not eating out if they believe me they would take a Rapture I'll say man because Enoch is our type amen but one thing about Enoch he pleased God whatever God said do amen Enoch said amen to amen remember you can't figure out God you don't debate with God you believe God if God say he's going to do it it's already done if God people said if God say you healed if the Bible say buy your stripes buy his stripes you are healed you heal okay what the doctor say okay with the report say God see I'm here I'm healed amen because God cannot lie man so we see Abraham Enoch said because Enoch said Enoch was translated right quickly man we're gonna be long but my point is this when you please God he gonna make everything work out for you how many guys we all got children will you tell your children to go do something you tell us at that time I got I'm Melanie she's not here tonight we went down Atlanta last night she was she was missionary now last night she was we got home at one o'clock last night she got up seven o'clock hey my Commandments much more God have a man because God said well we say if you were bad at me and my words abide in you you can ask what you really man but you must please God and you please God by keeping it not summon his word you keep all this wording amen not in his age if everybody this age is so glamorized and so so set up for everybody want to please one another they want to please man it's already good good but man can't do it so much amen but will you please God he'll work it out for you amen I don't know how many guys how many know how many know how many you can tell us hey Trinity say that God Is A Healer that God is a way maker that God is a heart is a heart fixed amen happy confusing I say I know God Can Make A Way man see but the Bible says he's a high priest of your profession and the brothers of that profession means your confession anyway and when you speak something remember you are now the the spoken word is the Original Seed and we advise if you if you doubt if you have faith and don't doubt whatever you have you can have because my seed my word cannot return void if you only believe coming with faith is a something we reveal to you that the devocation goes it's not it didn't cover it ain't covered no man it came straight from God quick testimony how many God's still moving and the Bible says faith without works is dead but you got faith favorite action amen your fake or say your favorite gonna say stay home your face I'm gonna come to church amen even if I'm tired how many was high tonight but I command my body to praise the Lord see there's some people realize the spoken word is the original sin will you speak stop and believe in it it cannot return void and God will make your body obey your confession amen about two weeks ago I heard my arm real bad at work couldn't I couldn't even hardly move it every time I moved it was hurting like at night time hurting I mean it's amazing at night time with any pain it magnifies by a thousand a man but I was so glad we man do it for a night but joy come in the morning man so I'm always hurting my mom and I think I'm watching so take some time now I'm saying I I want to take medicine I'm not going to mess up you want to take myself just say take some time now so I took a couple Tylenols and the pain was was that went away and it came right back and some say look at what Tylenol does do you realize that God don't know how Tylenol affect your body but whether it tricks your mind and thinking that the pain ain't there we get it still there so we're tying our way out with you you feel the pain is always there but Tylenol got something inside and trick your brain they say the pain ain't there that's how people get hooked on painkillers because why Tylenol does not heal it is Tay to bring dead body the pain ain't there but yet it's still there but they say Carlos thing does not as though they were so I said if Tylenol can do this for eight hours what can Faith do so as people say I'm Healed I'm still hurting but I'm Healed I'm Healed and one day I became healer Cody guy why faith without works is dead brother fake God say fake God will make your body obey your confession amen now my arm is stronger than every man cause by faith amen by favor by Faith by faith I'm a Christian amen by faithful record about amen by faith I'm overcoming a man it's all by faith amen when you speak the word amen your word becomes life and it cannot return of oh waiting look it up signs don't know wow title now work but when they do know it should you might think the pain ain't there when it's still right there but faith can take the pain away you with me there's a blind man say he say I thought you say you believe I say I thought you say you were I say I thought you say you I thought he said I thought you would say I was healed remember saying I thought you say you believe so leave the line stand you heal I'm Healed still blind I'm Healed still blind I mean but one day his body comes when he didn't his eyes popped doubly man why his body obeyed his confession glory to God you ain't speaking nothing you ain't getting nothing I see you ain't speaking on you ain't getting nothing man I speak life amen I speak Victoria because that God is real we don't say about dead God we save a living God the spoken word is the original City man I know what God did with Paul I know what God done with brother Brandon but what God do with you amen doing the very same thing amen how many know faith without works is dead and you please God by having faithful with God if God said he could do it you can he can do it amen God can do all things with Christ I'm about to come down close I'm feeling good man I've been a good of my spirit man this happened yesterday this happened it was the Fridays happened Thursday before I went to Atlanta get fixed I couldn't fix the car so I took it somewhere else and that the car went in car went in running and came out broke we still want me to pay for the car they still wouldn't pay for an hour the man put it in with a car he didn't broke the car but still won't pay me when we paid 208 dollars for the car and it's not you know we ain't running no more but the power of the spoken word on that way to go pick it I said Lord the bible say that the king hand is the king heart is in the hand of the lord lord I said Lord I don't know how I don't know when but I need you to make a way Lord I don't have no 2008 I say Lord whatever you Lord touch the man's heart and he let me have this car for free amen you gotta speak the word amen I spoke to him and when the word go out it cannot return void spoke the word brother Gordon goddamn man and a man said I said man the man that was talking to me I never knew before but another man I was not talking to he was he was a good feeling but when anyway when as soon as I walked you know who came was a man I know all along I said I couldn't pick the car I said um they say it's a 280 um there's no charge take the keys amen Lord of God the spoken word amen original silly man you have not because you acts 9 you asked not because you believe nothing it ain't God's fault it's your funny man but speak the word amen God Will Make A Way man amen [Applause] you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ain't God fault ain't brother Ernest fault ain't by the jail my fault ain't Pastor Simmons fault it's your own faulty man God is real when you call to him he'll be there you can call up Buddha all you want Buddha Kings help you in one pitch all I can't help you one bit man but I know a man you can call on Jesus and he eternal life say man by faith when you have a true Revelation the devil can't move you realize job didn't have no Bible but he had a revelation have a grip on the church too many people got a grip on a church they got a grip on friends but but probably God said job had a grip on God Amen The Good Devil took everything from job it did not move Joe he said lord giveth in the Lord but blessed be no you know the best thing to do when you get in trial again the great test STAR praising God say God I know you're gonna work it out for you man dude praise we're confused the enemy when the prices go up the blessings come down do whatever you start praising God in the missing your trials that make God happy that makes our state I mean I may God stand up and say who who are they praising God you with me amen everybody God said and science tell me will you worship pray and praise anything good or bad it released something called dopamine dopamine makes your body feel happy that's why they can be in five negative five degree weather in a football game freezing their tails off and praising and worshiping to hear God because they release they releasing The energy they don't even feel the cold they don't feel the heat because the energy they're releasing something to God that your body produce that makes you feel good and the Bible says uh uh Mary uh uh married being happy a happy heart is like medicine amen so you you when your soul feel when your spirit will your spirit feel happy real soul is happy your body become happy and so and that's why that's why during the process let's say bring me that's why it's so good to come get in the spirits and when you get the spirit it brings anointing down everybody say I have it the Praises of my people amen and so so he said so signs say when you relieve when you start praising gods that's their football gods that's the basketball God right sir we start a living God so in the midst of your trials in the midst of your test start praising God the Bible says when job lost everything he fell down he went Bourbon and crying he was worse with God he said lord giveth and the Lord take away blessed be the name of the Lord and that believes that release the anointing job it doesn't wait I wherever he whatever he'd have been through he's still praising God okay would you go through you still praise God in the good times praise God in the bad times praise God when you're sick praise God well you're broke praise God and watch God make a way man but praise God the Bible say Paul and Silas they got beaten all day long but at midnight they stay with murder they cry they start to praise God huh they said God they say God is still God he's a way maker he's a chain breaker he's a hard fixer and start praising God and God came down and broke the chains amen they praise God will you praise God it confuses the enemy okay my brother say mama say I'ma praise God I was created I was born to praise God please God when you please God he give you what you want your assistant had it right she pleased God she she remember said I had to write this on the dish they gave twenty dollars for the beautiful fund to the handy right made communion for the whole church but yeah she was a post sister had a broken down mother and father had bad children but she still praised God and she one day she praise God so much because I must come down to her house because she pleasing me I'm gonna do something my sister and brother said she came to Brother house man but better come and get it to another look whatever you do for God he gonna bless you amen he God will be unidentated to no man you do something God God will bless you amen if you have the right motive and objective God will bless everything you do amen the brother came to her house he was talking to squirrels and the silver chick reads A bear and we all know without faith without Revelation it's impossible to please God remember she was not dead when brother babe was doing those things but yet she believed a man I was not there when he when Moses partnered Red Sea but I believe they man in the same God part of the Red Sea he departure red she's not a man he is still God Amen so it makes no sense to say say brother say that she said that ain't nothing but the truth and God and she says that the peace God then God came and said get ever what she want give my daughter she has please she didn't please brother she pleased God so what do you want the Salvage my two boys and right then and there God gave her a request right because she pleased God whatever you do tonight says you please God the Bible said because remember 2 million came out but only two please God the rest died in the wilderness because they did not make sure they was hearing with faith they got out in the wilderness and forgot it was not most of us keeping them it was God keeping them so when he murdered against Moses they read it was more remember against God so okay what you do tonight saying you keep on praising God how bad thinking but if I said all things work together you lose your job praise God because God got something better I'm a living with it you praise God if you serve God by your heart body mind and shrimp God gonna bless you amen and the devil can't do nothing about amen but the main thing you must please the Mighty God Amen have another ordinary man bounce it out without faith and apostles please God and when you please God if I see him make his enemies will be at peace with you amen remember in the Bible God say man when a man when a man is so totally committed to God the devil don't know what to do with them because while he's totally committed to Gods too many people get committed churches I remember we ain't in a partner Movement we partner camp we part of a body amen and that's the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's give God praise man I'm gonna close that amen amen amen I pray something was said to help the United man we thank God for

meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight everything we do we want to please God Amen he was going on telling him talking about his arm and so many I thought about so many testimonies I said if we had testimony service we wouldn't go home tonight talking about the goodness of God and how faithful he is so here's the word I'll say a lot of times you know we could have been healed we could have been delivered could have been out of our troubles but God was waiting on our faith to hit that level God was letting us sometimes go around and everything else fail you and then you come to that point the way you say God I'm just going to trust in you and he came through every time didn't he God is so good it's good always to hear what God is doing and you know sometimes we can talk about what God has done but to talk about what God is doing now that just ignites your faith it'll cause you and your situation you know to go back and say Lord if you did it for brother Jenkins I know you can do it for me Lord God if you did it for this one or that one Lord I know you can do it for me Lord help me help me like this I believe Lord help my unbelief how many believe that tonight amen God is so good you know we serve awesome God tonight don't we we serve a mighty like I say all the time we serve a mighty mighty good God don't we we don't even understand the goodness of God and how good he is to us you know until we have those times when you know like he says in the bad times you know that's that's when the real anointing seemed to come in the in the dark times in the bad times in the Midnight Hour you know everything is going good you can shout and dance and praise God but when you're really going through and you're really in a rut like they say sometimes and then you find a way to praise God it looks like then in that place you know I believe like it's talking about Paul and Silas they could praise God and have good services but in that prison after being beaten after being all that and locked up and in the Midnight Hour and you can hear them begin to sing and I believe the like I said the real anointing come down and break the chains it's something about but you know to get those testimonies you got to get in those conditions sometimes we don't want we don't want those conditions we just want the victory or the testimonies after those conditions but we don't want the Shipwreck the snake bitten thrown in jail the beatons and all that we don't want that but we want the testimonies don't we but nevertheless God brings us through those things he brought us to it and he'll bring us through it won't he God is so good tonight I'm stirred brother Jenkins say you feel good I was feeling good too I know we all were tonight so we thank God you know um God is so good amen is get our brother Jeremiah to come close us tonight in his own way with brother Gordon you want to sing that song a little bit of it um the one you're singing We Serve an awesome God I
