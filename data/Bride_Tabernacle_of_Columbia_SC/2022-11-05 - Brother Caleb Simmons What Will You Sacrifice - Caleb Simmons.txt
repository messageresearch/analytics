the glory Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight I'd ask that you turn to the Book of Mark Mark chapter 12. and we'll start at the 41st 41st verse March at the 12 and verse 41 when you got to say Amen amen and it reads and Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were Rich cast in much and there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two mites which might make a farther which make a farthing and he called unto his disciples and saith unto them verily verily I say unto you that this poor Widow has cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast into their of their abundance but she of her one that crashed in all that she had even all her living amen God bless her read another word you may be seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic called what will you sacrifice what will you sacrifice in this story in the Bible Jesus was standing there and he was seeing how they were taking up their offering and he saw many people pour in a lot of things and they pour in great things and God God said here he said that those were not much because they had plenty but this woman all she had she gave everything that she had and God knew that her sacrifice was more and I want to ask you what will you sacrifice there's many things in the Bible where we see there were many sacrifices and from the Old Testament to the new but I want to ask you I wrote down the question if the Lord asked you to give up all would you if the Lord asked you to give up everything would you in this story here you see that the woman she gave up everything she had she gave up her last pennies even though she didn't know where her necks would come from she gave it up because she knew that God was a provider so what will you sacrifice tonight amen go to let's turn to the Book of Genesis chapter 22. story here many may be familiar with it and many may know the story it's about Abraham and Isaac and many know that God promised Abraham a son and it took him over 25 years to get that son and then when he came later on God said I want you to do something for me and this where the Story begins in in verse 22 and 1 it said and it came to pass after these sins that God detemt Abraham and said unto Abraham unto him Abraham he said behold here am I he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou love is and get thou into the land of Moriah and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him in Isaac his son Enclave the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him I want to bring attention here when God called Abraham he said Lord here am I he said behold here am I he didn't stutter he said Lord here am I and when the Lord told him what to do it didn't say that Abraham asked God questions it didn't say that Abraham was wondering what God wanted him to do he says he rose up early in the morning and he did exactly what the Lord told him to do he went on his journey he said what will you sacrifice and it reads on in verse 4 he said then on the third day Abram him lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I in the lab will go up yonder and worship and come again unto you see Abraham have faith that even though God told him to take his son and offer him up he knew that he was coming back he understood that whatever God wanted him to do God promised me the son he promised me a great nation from this son so God has a plan above my plan but Abraham was willing to sacrifice him Abraham was willing to say Lord this is what you want and said in verse 6 and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and took the fire in his hand and knife and they went both of them together and Isaac said unto Abraham his father he's his father and said my father he said here in my son he said behold the fire in the wood but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for the burnt offering so they both went up together see Abraham was trusting in not his ability but God's ability even if he had to sacrifice his son he knew that God was going to do something he knew that God was going to provide for that sacrifice he knew that God promised him and he held on to that promise and if you keep reading down it says in verse 9 and they came to the place where God had told of him and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham strep forth his hand and took the Knight to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lab neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God and seeing thou has not withheld thy son not only son from me see God got to the point he said I want to see what will you sacrifice I want to see what you are willing to give up I want to see what what what thing are you willing to give up will it be your most precious gift to Abraham his son was one of his most precious gifts he had gained the many things but his son he was his it was his only son by Sarah and and see he had gained a most precious gift and God said I want you to sacrifice him I want you to give up your only son and he said Lord here am I and he did exactly what God wanted him to but if you read down further you see that God provided a lamb in the bush he provided a ram in that bush where God said I just wanted to see what you were willing to sacrifice I wanted to see what you were willing to give up I wanted to see how far you would go how much could I trust you how much could I trust you with the gift that I want to give you because when you come to that certain point and you come to that area God want to see if I give you this will you give it up for me if I gave you the whole world would you give it up for me because it says in the scripture you don't want to gain the whole world and lose your soul you don't want to get gain all these things in this life and never make it into heaven and God may ask us sometimes what will you sacrifice will it be your job will it be your children he asked Abraham for his son but what would are you willing to sacrifice so there are many things and I think of the story of Jesus the ultimate sacrifice the one that came down for he didn't have to do what he did but he came down for us and he took upon all of our sins and he died on Calvary for our sins and he was whipped and persecuted for us that's what John 19 says and he was sacrificed for us how much more should we be willing to give up the small things in this life to gain eternal life how much more should we look at and say this is not worth much what it's worth is eternal life what is worth is me giving up a small thing in this life Paul said I Die daily why did he say that because he was willing to sacrifice daily for God he was willing to say Lord all the things that I have gained I counted as not all the things that I have achieved I counted as not because it's not worth anything if I don't make it in it's not worth anything Lord if I don't do what you want me to do with my life Lord I want to sacrifice everything for you I want to give up everything for you I said with everything in life when if your plate is full and you say yes to something else something has to come off something has to come off of that plate when your plate is full and you say yes to something else something has to come off I said if you say yes to Jesus you're saying no to the devil if you say yes to heaven then you're saying no to hell it's a choice that you're making but what will you sacrifice will you do you want pleasure for a season or do you want eternal life that's the way that you that you have to go and you have to ask yourself what am I willing to sacrifice what am I willing to give up for you because even though it may be pleasure for this life and on in this season it won't last for long it won't last for for an eternity but I want to get eternal life amen in in the Book of Matthew chapter 6 verse 24 it reads it reads it says it says that no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon see there was a there was something that he had to sacrifice I remember reading the Young Rich ruler he came to the point and he had something that he had to sacrifice God asked him he said all he said I want you to keep the commanders he said all these things have I done for my youth and then God said give all that I have and give it unto the poor but because he was young he was rich and he thought that he knew everything and said I'm better off I'm better off with all the things that I have in this life he never counted his eternal destination he never looked towards where am I going to spend my future and say that yeah and the Bible says you can't serve God and man you can't serve two masters you got to make a choice what are you willing to sacrifice what are you willing to give up to gain eternal life what what friends are you willing to give up to gain eternal life what people are you willing to let go to gain eternal life I said I was reading one of one of the messages the prophet of gospel he said the Forsaken all and he said he said here he said Jesus said as the scripture says he that loveth the world or the things of the world the love of God is not in him see right it takes forsaken all it takes you giving up everything to reach eternal life he said there was another part of Abraham where he said now Abraham forsaken his people what did he get back out of it what comes besides that he becomes the father of many nations God made him the father of many nations what little he gave up then look what he become Jesus said he who will forsake me will have fathers mothers and so forth look what Abraham got by forsaking all and following him yes sir the father of many nations but first he had to separate himself from all unbelief even from his cold lukewarm and church member brother lot he had to forsake himself for that everything that's got unbelief in it you have to separate yourself everything that has unbelief in it you have to separate yourself anything if it's a Creed if it's if you're in church and that's all you're dependent on is a Creed and don't believe the word it's the word if the word is contrary to the Creed is contrary to the word you'll have to forsake that you'll have to forsake everything and listen he said and God never did bless Abraham until he totally obeyed him God never blessed Abraham until he totally obeyed him Abraham wanted to take his daddy along and the old man was a fly in anointment all the time finally he died and then a lot there was Strife in everything and then as soon as Abraham fully obeyed God and separated himself and let and let lot go down there to the good lands where he wanted to go down in Sodom then God appeared to Adam's Abraham and said lift up your eyes I give you I give the whole thing to you so what are you willing to sacrifice Abraham didn't want to sacrifice his father Abraham didn't want to sacrifice his neighbor his nephew but God had to remove them he had to sacrifice and let him go let him go their ways before he could get his Blessing before he could get the promise everything that God promised him said as soon as Abraham fully obeyed and separated himself God gave him everything that he told him he would give him so what are you willing to sacrifice what are you willing to put on the Altar and leave it there what are you willing to say Lord I'm going to put this in your hands and leave it there so that I can get everything that you want me to to have I said there were many things in the Bible where you look at there were many sacrifices you look at the story in Genesis 4 of Cain and Abel both two Cain made a sacrifice and Abel made a sacrifice but God only came down on one God only came down on Abel's sacrifices because it was the right sacrifice it was the right sacrifice that Abel did and Cain got jealous and that's why he killed his brother but he gave the right sacrifice what do you what will you sacrifice because many of times you come to the crossroads and you can't sacrifice something but God may be like that's not what I wanted that's not what I wanted you to sacrifice but but we think that it's okay because we sacrificed we think that it's okay because we gave God something I I like to say don't give God a mess give them your best because that's what God requires of her he gave his best for us he sent his only son down so why should we give God a mess why should we give God anything and expect him to accept it that's what Cain did and God said I don't want that sacrifice God said that that's not what I require he said I require the blood yeah I require the sacrifice of the Lamb the blood the Abel required and Cain God tell us but why do we expect God to to accept sacrifices that we give him when it's not our best why should we if God did Cain like that why why shouldn't he reject ours but what will you sacrifice tonight and there was a woman in the book of Kings she was a widow woman and she had a child and there was a famine in the lane in the land and many know the story this woman she got there and she was a widow and she said all I got is one meal left all I have is one meal left and me and my son are going to eat this meal and we're gonna die but she met somebody out there one day he said make me a meal first she didn't know who it was but she said okay I'll do it and she and she went ahead and and it was a Prophet Elijah he said if you make my meal first your oil will never run dry in your cup and your couple would never run bare see it was what she was willing to sacrifice it was she gave everything that she had because that was all she had she gave everything that she had because that was all that she had sometimes God said I want you to give me everything that you have I want you to give it all and he wants to see if you're going to do it with job he came and he took it all and he he took everything from job except for his life and because God knew what job possessed he knew what Joel was willing to sacrifice for him he knew what job was willing to put down for him and said I know job through all his struggle he said I know my redeemer lives he through all the things that God took for him and he and he sacrificed he knew that God was still able God was still able to bring him forth but what will you sacrifice what are you willing to give off for him because God requires us all to sacrifice something God requires us all to give up something God requires us no matter what it is and what you may have to give up may be different from me but he requires it from each and every one of us he asks us what will we sacrifice I think of the story of Peter Peter one time he came he came and he thought about it maybe he said said he said there Sarah Peter asked the Lord he said now we have forsaken all to follow you we have forsaken all look what we have done we left our homes we left our families we left our lands we left everything we had to follow him see Peter they gave it up all when Jesus called them off the ship they left their father in the ship and said we're going to follow this man because we know that who he is and they began to Dawn on him and maybe he had been carried so far away in the work watching Christ and so forth that he had never dawned on him that he had left his home he has left his family he had left his father and his mother he had left all that he had to follow Jesus sometimes Christ calls us to a life of separation and you wonder why why do I have to separate us but sometimes I think back and I said maybe that's what God wants me to do in order to make it maybe that's what I got to do to make it you question why you go through certain things but we never think of maybe God wanted me to sacrifice these things for me to make it but that's exactly what God requires forsake all and follow him that's God's requirement we've got to do it sometimes we got to forsake our very thoughts if our thoughts about anything is contrary to God's word we've got to forsake our own thinking to follow him and the only way we can follow him is follow his word obey it God requests and require and God's requirements that we forsake all and follow him and the only way we can follow him is through his word each and every day Lord send me a word that I may follow you Lord created me a clean heart O Lord and renew a right spirit in me that's what David said because he knew that he needed more to sacrifice he said Lord I got to give more to you I got to do more for you Lord Jesus I gotta Lord give up some more because Lord I want to see you working in my life I want to know that Lord when I go to play Lord you're with me not just in me you're with me as well Lord and Lord I Want Your Presence to be near that's why David said Lord created me a clean heart that's why Paul said Lord I Die daily because he wanted God's presence with him each and every day he knew there was a continual sacrifice there was a continual dying out to God there was a continual say Lord work on me Lord chiseled the things out of me that's not like you to take everything that's not like you out of me Lord that you may get the glory not my glory but your glory Lord not what I want but what you want me to do Lord I can forsake all I can sacrifice everything and know the Lord there was no one that you didn't provide more than I exceedingly abundantly more than we can ask a thing because that's who God is that's who God is he promised to be a provider he promised to be a Healer he promised that if you forsake it I will do I will do more than you can ever think and he said that if the devil is after you if the devil ain't after you he's got you that's all because as long as he's after you that's a sign he hasn't got you yet but if he isn't after you it's a sign that he's got you yeah so just remember as long as he's blasting at you you're a few jumps ahead of him yet just keep on going just keep on going and if you continue to sacrifice to the Lord the more he'll do the he'll do for you he says here he said if you forsake the things of the world in the world and the things of the girl God will repay you so many times God will repay you so many times I know we have many witnesses of what God can do if you sacrifice for him there's so many people sitting here that can say Lord you can see the works of what God has done in your life to see the works of what how far God has brought you by your sacrifice to him just sacrifice in your life to him and it's a testimony to see the ones that walk with God the ones that know that just sacrificing in your youth provides a life that God that you never thought you may have and when you look around for the people that were around you and see where the life end up and you see where yours is all you can do is say thank you Lord thank you Lord that I sacrifice when I did no matter when it was when you came and gave that sacrifice to him do you say Thank You Lord because I should have been here and I would have been there but God you kept me God you know from My Sacrifice Lord I might not have been perfect but God you accepted the Lord I want to present and blameless before you Lord I want to give you everything Lord that you continue to work you continue to go on you continue to move in my life Lord you continue to guide Lord I want to continue the sacrifice that we can see your work in my life I can see you moving I can see you living I can see you doing the mighty things of God because I want to put the right sacrifice on this altar I want to give you everything Lord because I know that you can do it I know I believe that you can do it Lord you said in your word that you would do it and I'm standing on that I'm resting on this Lord I'm standing on your promises I'm standing I'm believing that Lord you've never lost one I'm believing that God you are a Healer Lord I'm believing that you are a deliverer I'm believing that you're the only one that can provide Lord I'm believing that no matter how the world looks today you still got me you're still keeping me Lord and it's by My Sacrifice down on my knees praying Lord that you'll provide Lord are down on my knees saying Lord I Thank you for everything that you've done I thank you for keeping me I thank you see it's a sacrifice to pray it's a sacrifice to get before him and say Lord I need you it's a sacrifice to admit Lord I'm wrong it's a sacrifice to get down and say Lord I want you I want you to move in my life I want you to provide in my life Lord see people may look at you strange by the way you live in your life that's a sacrifice to not go against to go against the current that's a sacrifice but you never look at it like that and say I want to do this I want to do that it's a sacrifice not to do what everyone is doing it's a sacrifice to when people say we going here and you say no when you say no I'm not going to do this because this is not right I don't believe in doing this but that that's a sacrifice and God is expecting us to make the right sacrifice God is expecting us to bring the right sacrifice to him that he may get all the glory that he may get all the honorable what will you sacrifice have you come to that point that you willing to give a sacrifice give your sacrifice to him have you come to that point where you come to the altar where God calls and may knock like Abraham and say will you say Lord here am I and whatever God tells you to do you do it whatever he said you don't question it you do it like Abraham he didn't question God he did it God asked him for the one of the most precious gifts that he had given him he said will you give it back to me God may ask you will you give me what he has given you will you give him and you'll be like well God you gave it to me why would you ask for it back why would you ask for what you gave to me back or maybe it's a test maybe as God is one to see how far will you go how how far are you willing to give that sacrifice will you stop will you say that no I'm not going to do this I'm not willing to sacrifice this I'm not willing to sacrifice that but Abraham had to get to the point where everyone around him had to move away they had to get around so that he could get his true blessing he could get all the blessings that God promised him but what are you willing to sacrifice what are you willing to give to him to reach everything that God has for you foreign [Applause] you know these last couple days I've been telling a lot of people I said you know out of all the out of all the achievements in life or everything you seek out to do and the Lord might bless you to achieve it I says but when you leave in this world it's only one thing that's going to matter and whether or not your soul right with God or not so I said out of all the I've been telling people that for the last couple days out of all the achievements you remember now there's only one thing that's going to matter when you're leaving this world out of all your disappointments out all of your highs and all your lows when you leave in the world this world it's only one thing that's going to matter whether or not your soul right with God or not So I says just saying that to people and just thinking about that myself I says only things you do for God is what's going to last and that's what all our pressing is about and that's why we go the extra distance that's why we do the extra you know it's easy I was ministering the other day I was out of the Book of Malachi and how he was telling them you bring the polluted the lame the blind all these things and you offer them up to me and he began to say tell him you know you robbed me wherewith you robbed me through tithes and offerings he says you say that we ain't gonna do pretty much what we're supposed to do because we're doing it in vain and he says but I want you to prove me he says I want you to prove me he says return unto me and he says if you prove me he says and watch when I open the windows of heaven and pour you out blessings that you won't have room enough to receive I said a lot of times people stop short of doing all that they could or as I brought kids saying making that sacrifice because they say we're doing it in vain God ain't blessed us yet or God ain't blessing us but you can't gain as godliness but you forgot that the Bible says wherever you find yourself at remember to be content and you know that it ain't always uh Financial in those areas but God bless you with the gift of life we bless you with eyes to see legs to walk and all those things I said so you know in serving God it's not it's not hard when you love God when you when God God come really come into your life and you gave it all over to him because you was tired of the world you was tired of the devil beating you down it's not easy it's not hard I meant to serve God it becomes easy you know but as my brother Kenneth was saying tonight how God tries you a lot of times you give up a lot of stuff but you hold back a lot of stuff too and God comes after those things because he knows that you'll love those things more than him so he began pulling on him but I thank God because you know I only Prophet God was saying once that you know sometimes you have to uh just paraphrase and look look whatever something that's hold you hold dear to you in the face and turn around and walk away from it in order for your soul to be saved but I says in all our running I'll run a name in vain I was sharing with somebody the other night I says you know you already in your 40s and I'm right there at the door 40. I says no when we was teenagers I said we ain't we ain't never thought about this this day coming when I said time flying in it so you have time flying I said so there's a little bit of time that we got the little bit of time we got here come on this ain't nothing compared to Eternity not compared to eternal life you know and what we give up so I say what are you to sacrifice come on Jesus gave all what will you give you know I was reading that scripture the other day how when Peter and Jesus told him go out and cast your nets they went out and cast them and it says when they got back to the bank the Bible says they forsook all and followed him and they didn't look back neither did they but they went on with God so what will you give up tonight remember as I said I was saying all week out of all your achievements think about it all your plans or if you already achieved your plans everything you seeking after all your goals you know out of all your hardships the bad times the good times out of everything in this life that you've faced with or that you're reaching for you know it might not be outside of uh God's will or it might not be a sin or those things but keep somewhere in your heart on your mind that none of that ain't gonna matter when you leave in this world but only things you do for God is that's what's gonna last you know Jesus was talking about people that rich down here on Earth but they pour up there I said God I don't want to be that way if I have to be in rags and sometimes you say oh that's just a sin but God knows that's the truth I want my soul to be saved I want my house to be saved I want all around me to be saved because we can look back after it's all said and done and say what did it mean it didn't mean nothing that rich man when he woke up and lifted up his eyes in hell come on he realized then what matter what what really mattered didn't he he realized it then so I said at all achievements all the reaching all of what you striving to do remember when your eyes are closing maybe God should take you that way but when you leaving it ain't but one thing that's gonna matter where I'm work in the morning like they say when I Rise Give Me Jesus Lord I don't know about you but I think about that all the time where am I standing with you so I lay down tonight Lord where am I standing with you I get up go to off in my day because things can happen at any time anything can happen at any time but I said Lord where am I standing with you you know so many people went on about their daily business not even thinking about that and and God called for their life or he called for them and they had to be required of what did they do with the time that he gave them I told the people the other day some people I said God only obligated to call you once so today you hear his voice you need to take heed to his voice because it's the mercy of God that you can hear his voice I'm so glad I'm so glad today as I was sharing with the person the other day that you know while we were teenagers I'm glad that when I heard his voice I answered it it was tough you say it was tough and I say it wasn't really tough because it was something pulling on me it was something that was reaching out to me and I even said myself Lord I don't know how I'm gonna do it I'm gonna need your help and don't you know God help me because the desire was there and that's what God working with even tonight the desire no matter where you are in life position you find yourself God working with the desire do you have the desire to serve God do you have the desire do you do you want God I told somebody that I said you got to First make it up in your mind whether you want to serve God or not other than that we're just going through the motion you know you're gonna come and and just go through all emotion and still don't make it I says but do you do you want to serve God because if you do he made a way through a shed Blood on the cross you know he came down he did it just for you and I how rotten how filthy and all those things we were but remember what he did on the cross if you can receive that I know one thing when I received received it it did something for me when I when I looked to Calvary it lifted me up out of the place I was at I was in darkness I'm in real darkness but when I saw Calvary it did lift me up out of that place it made me a free man the way I could worship God freely I didn't have to come to the house of God and be bound and change them in those things anymore but God did something for my life you know a lot of people might have looked they say oh he pretending but none of that didn't matter because God did something for me God knows y'all love the Lord tonight come on what would you sacrifice remember all you reaching for and grabbing for and we all got goals that we reaching and trying to achieve but somewhere in your day somewhere when you go on alone having your mind Lord if you were to call me right now it's my soul right or or having your mind God where do I stand with you all the money in the world don't mean nothing when your eyes are closing all the houses all the land all the popularity none of that don't mean nothing when your eyes are closing you just another one got to stand before the white Throne judgment and if you got to stand there in your own righteousness or your own come on that ain't that ain't good but it's the one that that know he a sinner no he was unfit but he accepted the blood and he's standing there knowing he ain't worthy come on but the blood speaks for him I'm so glad tonight that the blood will speak for us amen amen we thank God that judgment begins not in the house of the Lord and and if we be judged now we won't be condemned with the
