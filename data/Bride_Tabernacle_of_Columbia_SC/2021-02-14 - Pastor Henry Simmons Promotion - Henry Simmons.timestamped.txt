[37:34] then gathered together saw these men
[37:37] upon whom bodies the fire had no power
[37:41] nor was and hair of their head
[37:45] stench sent
[37:48] neither were their clothes changed
[37:53] nor the smell of fire had passed
[37:57] on them then never can never speak
[38:00] and said blessed be the god of shadrach
[38:04] meshach and abednego who has sent his
[38:07] angels
[38:09] and delivered his servants that
[38:12] trusted in him and have
[38:16] changed the king's word
[38:19] and yield their bodies
[38:23] that they might not serve nor worship
[38:27] any god except their own god
[38:31] therefore i make a decree that every
[38:34] people
[38:34] nations and language which speak
[38:37] anything amidst against the god of
[38:41] shadrach meshach and abednego shall be
[38:44] cut

[38:48] a dumb heel
[38:49] because there is no other god
[38:52] that can deliver after the sword

[41:45] rapture and he
[41:47] just talking about the god uh before the
[41:50] foundation of the world

[41:54] you as sons and daughters of god
[41:57] god really recognized you in his mind
[41:59] before the foundation of the world
[42:02] amen he said if you ever were a son of
[42:04] god then you were a son of god
[42:06] amen in thought form in the mind of god

[50:51] him
[50:52] what shall be done unto the man whom the
[50:54] king delighteth to honor
[50:56] now haman thought in his heart to whom
[50:58] would the king delight
[51:00] to do honor more than to myself and

[56:38] god has a plan now in genesis here
[56:43] oh i said 49
[56:52] nope i'm talking about 41. maybe i just
[56:55] want to look at 41.
[56:58] 41 and 39
[57:02] goodness i'm looking in the room
[57:05] and 39 41 and 39
[57:09] i'll read it 41 39
[57:12] and pharaoh said unto joseph for as much
[57:16] as god has chosen thee
[57:19] and shown thee all this
[57:23] there is none so discreet
[57:26] and wise as doll you know he told him to
[57:30] set a wise man over
[57:31] pharaoh had to dream and you know nobody
[57:34] can interpret the dream and joseph
[57:35] interpreted the dream
[57:37] and told him he should set a wise man
[57:39] over the prophet over the
[57:41] the during the fame and time and that
[57:44] man would
[57:45] amen know what to do amen because the
[57:47] dream
[57:48] interpretation told him what to do and
[57:50] pharaoh chose a man
[57:53] see after joseph done been sold into
[57:56] egypt
[57:56] after part of the wife lied on him he's
[57:59] in prison
[58:00] here joseph comes up out of the prison
[58:02] in the trophy to dream
[58:04] your gift will make room for you
[58:08] your gift that god has given you will
[58:10] make room for you
[58:12] praise god and nobody can take that when
[58:15] you're spiritual
[58:17] and god has given you amen true gifts
[58:21] nobody can take advantage of you and
[58:23] that's what that's what's the motto amen
[58:25] we had so many people that are so
[58:27] spiritual minded
[58:29] amen that makes so many bad decisions
[58:32] because they
[58:33] are so spiritual minded but take it back
[58:36] through the word
[58:38] that how spiritual people were promoted
[58:42] if you take it through the word you'll
[58:44] see whether or not you're
[58:45] filtering is it a thinking man filter
[58:48] are you filtering it through the word or
[58:50] you're taking it back through the urine
[58:52] through them
[58:52] and see where the lights flash over your
[58:55] decisions
[58:57] see sometimes we amen we don't take it
[59:00] back to the word
[59:01] and see what is stand before the word
[59:04] will amen in our own mind thinking that
[59:07] the decisions that we make
[59:09] the things that we are doing the things
[59:10] that we are saying
[59:12] amen it works because we get somebody
[59:15] that would stand with to somebody that
[59:17] was side with
[59:18] us somebody said you right you're right
[59:20] you're right
[59:22] amen but remember the story of real bone
[59:25] and jeroboam
[59:26] amen that solomon had done things that
[59:30] he shouldn't have done and amen so his
[59:32] son
[59:33] real born was taking charge of the
[59:35] kingdom and when real born
[59:37] was told amen by the elders amen
[59:40] don't do like your father did amen
[59:43] because what your father
[59:44] did it caused hardship on the people but
[59:49] instead of listening to the elders they
[59:51] listened to the young me
[59:53] he listened to the young people the

[1:01:29] better at the
[1:01:30] end of the road that you stood for the
[1:01:32] word and god will come in
[1:01:35] on time like he did for shadrach meshach

[1:07:43] when you can laugh i remember a
[1:07:46] situation when a
[1:07:49] brother had done me really really bad
[1:07:52] and i said i knew someday god will show
[1:07:56] who's right and who's wrong
[1:07:59] it took years and years you know what i
[1:08:02] fell for
[1:08:03] and when god brought to light that
[1:08:05] brother
[1:08:07] and showed his ministry in his life
[1:08:11] it brought tears to my eyes because i
[1:08:14] all i can look at
[1:08:15] is his children his wife
[1:08:18] and what they was going through at that
[1:08:21] time

[1:08:41] family had to go through at that time
[1:08:44] are you with me a lot of hurt
[1:08:48] but brother and sister don't you know in
[1:08:50] time and process of time

[1:09:03] you must not be happy or brother sister
[1:09:06] fall or backslash
[1:09:08] oh thank the lord i know there was no
[1:09:10] good all the time ah
[1:09:11] no that is not the attitude that's not
[1:09:15] the attitude we should have
[1:09:16] we should have lord i feel sorry for my
[1:09:20] brother lord
[1:09:21] if there's any kind of way you can help
[1:09:22] him help him lord
[1:09:24] lord they need help they need you nana

[1:09:36] that and your
[1:09:37] your first impressions say well i got

[1:09:45] conviction to drop in your heart
[1:09:48] because you got the spirit of god said i
[1:09:50] don't like that
[1:09:52] i don't like what you did amen
[1:09:55] and if you got the right spirit and you
[1:09:57] got the holy spirit in you
[1:09:58] he'll he'll bring you to in the
[1:10:00] subjection he'll check you
[1:10:03] are you with me i'm not saying sometimes
[1:10:06] we don't
[1:10:08] react the wrong way but the holy ghost
[1:10:11] would bring us back
[1:10:12] so that ain't right are you with me
[1:10:17] he says here thou shall be
[1:10:20] over my house and according to
[1:10:24] thy word shall all
[1:10:27] my people be rude see god will promote
[1:10:32] he says only in the throne will i be
[1:10:35] greater than thou amen
[1:10:40] here a rapid promotion after all
[1:10:44] the time and i'm telling you brother and
[1:10:46] sister
[1:10:47] the promotion that the bride is going to
[1:10:50] undertake
[1:10:51] it could be rapid very rapid
[1:10:56] at any day now there'll be a showdown
[1:10:59] and the bride will be promoted
[1:11:03] it's only if she's come to character
[1:11:06] she's been carried to build
[1:11:11] as she's shown itself to overcome
[1:11:13] certain trials and tribulations and
[1:11:15] things
[1:11:16] this is character built in time where
[1:11:19] god is molding us
[1:11:20] into his image and into his likeness
[1:11:23] so in character building time we must
[1:11:26] understand
[1:11:27] that when promotion time it could be
[1:11:29] instantaneously
[1:11:31] the bride has amen ready for the
[1:11:33] showdown and god was really
[1:11:35] amen putting the bride on this play and
[1:11:39] everything that the book of acts talked
[1:11:41] about and that
[1:11:42] that you know the third poor amen the
[1:11:45] double potion
[1:11:46] the book of acts ministry everything is
[1:11:49] rapidly because she's ready for it she's
[1:11:53] showing that
[1:11:54] amen uh that the power amen without
[1:11:58] character
[1:11:59] amen is satanic amen but
[1:12:02] with character you fit to rule amen
[1:12:06] that you know how to conduct your lives
[1:12:08] you know how
[1:12:09] amen that love has entered into a
[1:12:12] capstone perfect love
[1:12:14] has come to his climax you know you've
[1:12:16] got you've gone
[1:12:18] amen to everything that comes against
[1:12:20] you you just
[1:12:21] love love love amen you just forgive
[1:12:24] forgive forgive
[1:12:26] you come to that stage amen that when
[1:12:28] god want to
[1:12:29] amen kick in amen praise god we got to
[1:12:32] come
[1:12:33] this thing got to move quickly he said
[1:12:35] to judas what you do do quickly
[1:12:37] amen because i always come amen
[1:12:40] everything moving so rapidly you know we
[1:12:44] look at the white house and we look at
[1:12:45] the political scene
[1:12:46] everything is moving rapidly in in the
[1:12:49] place
[1:12:50] but you your ministry your life
[1:12:52] everything you move rapidly into the
[1:12:54] place
[1:12:55] amen all of a sudden the power of god
[1:12:57] strikes the bride
[1:12:59] as individuals not as a church not as a
[1:13:01] movement
[1:13:02] but as individuals the power of god
[1:13:04] striking the sea
[1:13:05] they meant all of a sudden she's
[1:13:08] stepping out in victory
[1:13:09] stepping out in authority stepping out
[1:13:11] in power
[1:13:13] amen as individuals not as a group but
[1:13:16] as individuals are you with me
[1:13:19] amen so individually god is more than
[1:13:21] you
[1:13:22] as an individual not as a collective
[1:13:24] body
[1:13:25] amen some will be left behind to go
[1:13:27] through the great tribulation period
[1:13:29] others amen a step out in power amen and
[1:13:33] as they near the
[1:13:34] oh to tell you
[1:13:38] she'll be saying come lord jesus amen
[1:13:41] god began to work so modern
[1:13:43] oh i believe that's what happened all of
[1:13:46] a sudden he's in prison
[1:13:48] now he's ruling are you with me
[1:13:54] let me just go to philippians here too
[1:13:56] philippians 2
[1:13:58] god is good amen it's so much uh
[1:14:02] in what what god is saying
[1:14:06] to uh sometimes you get so stunned
[1:14:09] because i said lord it's just
[1:14:15] i pray i said god you know it's easy to
[1:14:18] get up and give a good message and give
[1:14:20] a good sermon
[1:14:21] but it's something to give something in
[1:14:23] season in time that god wants
[1:14:25] it to be said and i said lord i want to
[1:14:29] be right
[1:14:31] i said whatever i say i want you to say
[1:14:34] it
[1:14:35] i don't want my spirit to be in it
[1:14:39] i want your spirit to have the
[1:14:40] preeminence
[1:14:42] i don't want it to be something that i'm
[1:14:44] saying and i don't want to have nothing
[1:14:46] in me so clean me up lord sanctify me
[1:14:50] holy
[1:14:51] make sure that your word could be pure
[1:14:54] and he can come forth
[1:14:56] amen so he said
[1:14:59] the pure in heart shall see god are you
[1:15:02] with me
[1:15:02] so we got to have a pure heart amen we
[1:15:05] cannot have a
[1:15:07] amen a vein dick
[1:15:10] that type of way of doing things it's
[1:15:13] got to be
[1:15:14] from a pure heart god you're trying to
[1:15:16] take your people somewhere
[1:15:17] may they catch on amen
[1:15:20] you're trying to get them out of here to
[1:15:22] glory lord
[1:15:24] may we have a word in season that is
[1:15:26] needful for your bride
[1:15:28] that she can draw closer to you
[1:15:31] that's what i want so
[1:15:34] philippians 2 and 5 he says
[1:15:37] here let this mind be in you
[1:15:42] which is also in what in christ jesus
[1:15:47] see the bible says that we have the mind
[1:15:50] of christ isn't that right
[1:15:52] but he said let this mind be in you it
[1:15:54] must be a reminder
[1:15:56] that i want you to remember let this
[1:15:58] mind be
[1:15:59] what kind of mind would christ have
[1:16:01] brother and sister in our age and our
[1:16:03] day
[1:16:04] amen our action and what we're doing
[1:16:07] is it the mind of christ
[1:16:10] would christ think uh respond and react
[1:16:14] like we react
[1:16:17] in our everyday walk in our spiritual
[1:16:19] world let's reevaluate our steps
[1:16:22] re-evaluate our action let us take a
[1:16:26] close examination
[1:16:27] and say lord amen it's just the mind of
[1:16:31] christ
[1:16:32] it's just how you would conduct yourself
[1:16:34] or behave
[1:16:36] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:16:39] christ
[1:16:40] who being in the what form of god
[1:16:43] thought it not what
[1:16:46] robbery to be equal with god he knew who
[1:16:48] he was
[1:16:50] amen he knew he was he was he know he
[1:16:53] was the word made flesh he knew that god
[1:16:56] was in him
[1:16:57] he knew his authority and his power and
[1:16:59] what he could do amen but he did not
[1:17:03] use it amen
[1:17:06] and rather this is what he did the bible
[1:17:09] says here
[1:17:11] but made himself a what
[1:17:14] made himself of no reputation and took
[1:17:18] upon him the form of a what
[1:17:20] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:17:23] what
[1:17:24] men and was made in the likeness of men
[1:17:27] and
[1:17:28] being found in the fashion of a man he
[1:17:30] what
[1:17:32] he what and
[1:17:35] the quality that is missing in the
[1:17:39] the church and in the bride today is
[1:17:42] humility
[1:17:45] how do we look at our humility our
[1:17:48] humbling ourselves
[1:17:50] we must be able to humble ourselves
[1:17:53] before him
[1:17:55] and yes we we battle our flesh we battle
[1:17:59] our
[1:17:59] personal will and our desires we got to
[1:18:02] be humble
[1:18:04] amen and to do that sometimes we have to
[1:18:07] fight we have to pray
[1:18:09] we have to get breakthroughs we have to
[1:18:10] get closer to god
[1:18:12] in order to walk in humility are you
[1:18:15] with me
[1:18:17] he said humbled himself and became what
[1:18:20] obedience of death even what
[1:18:24] the death of the cross amen wherefore
[1:18:26] god has what
[1:18:29] holly what he promoted him
[1:18:34] but that's only when he was proven
[1:18:37] he he passed the test he qualified for
[1:18:40] promotion
[1:18:42] are you with me because he humbled
[1:18:44] himself
[1:18:45] when he said i could have called 12
[1:18:47] legion of angels
[1:18:48] but instead amen he humbled himself
[1:18:52] the bible says amen
[1:18:56] to death even the death of the cross
[1:18:58] isn't that right
[1:18:59] he humming himself and wherefore god has
[1:19:01] highly exalted him and giving him a what
[1:19:05] a name you know to be called mrs jesus

[1:21:12] the contrast into the humility of god
[1:21:15] and to promotion lucifer

[1:21:25] thing he exalts himself

[1:21:34] where we shouldn't be sometimes we want
[1:21:37] what god don't want
[1:21:40] amen lucifer has a
[1:21:44] a spirit if he can't get what he wants

[1:22:42] him to do
[1:22:43] she had him thrown into prison she
[1:22:44] wanted him dead
[1:22:47] let's get rid of him and the devil amen
[1:22:50] knew that he
[1:22:51] he was defeated in heaven amen he come
[1:22:54] to take over the earth and jesus showed
[1:22:56] up
[1:22:58] when jesus showed up and amen he saw
[1:23:01] himself
[1:23:02] powerless he wanted to do everything he
[1:23:05] can do i'm going to get rid of this
[1:23:07] jesus

[1:23:22] daughters
[1:23:23] and he'll take care of business look
[1:23:25] what lucifer said
[1:23:27] how thou fallen from heaven o lucifer
[1:23:32] son of the morning thou
[1:23:36] ha cut down to the ground
[1:23:41] lucifer and absalom had things in common
[1:23:44] lucifer and absent absalom
[1:23:48] david you know i can do a better job
[1:23:50] than king david i'm more beautiful than
[1:23:52] him
[1:23:54] amen in other words i'm a wiser than him
[1:23:59] so why is david being king
[1:24:02] i need to be the king are you with me
[1:24:07] so lucifer and his desire
[1:24:10] amen to take over heaven i
[1:24:13] you know why should i have it look how
[1:24:15] beautiful i am
[1:24:17] oh look i you know lucifer must have
[1:24:20] thought
[1:24:20] let me go over here and tell angels
[1:24:22] about it y'all listen to me
[1:24:25] y'all know god if i
[1:24:28] am god you know absolutely i'll promote
[1:24:31] y'all y'all know god's doing y'all wrong
[1:24:35] and i'll i'll give you you know a higher
[1:24:38] position than you got angels
[1:24:39] but god you know what i'm saying god
[1:24:42] knew uh
[1:24:43] i'm gonna tell you brother and sister
[1:24:44] god got it all he
[1:24:46] you know god you don't think god saw
[1:24:48] what lucifer was doing
[1:24:50] his eyes on the spiral he watches over
[1:24:53] he saw all that lucifer was doing
[1:24:55] but lucifer was able to convince a third
[1:24:57] of the stars of starting angels
[1:25:00] oh you look man if he could do that in
[1:25:02] heaven
[1:25:03] what about here on the earth
[1:25:06] that the devil if you allow him
[1:25:10] he'll come in and he'll try to convince
[1:25:12] you that
[1:25:14] wrong is right and right is wrong
[1:25:17] are you what man if it was apostle but
[1:25:21] the bible said he'll deceive the even
[1:25:23] the very late
[1:25:24] but for the shortness of days god made a
[1:25:26] shock don't you think this thing ain't
[1:25:28] close
[1:25:29] it's close brother it's very close
[1:25:32] sister
[1:25:34] he says how thou fall into the ground
[1:25:38] which did weaken the nation for thou has
[1:25:41] said
[1:25:42] in thy heart i will ascend to what
[1:25:45] heaven and i will what
[1:25:49] that's what i'm talking about the bible
[1:25:51] says wherefore god has highly exalted
[1:25:53] him
[1:25:55] not i exalt myself
[1:25:58] amen sometimes we think that
[1:26:02] this is what i supposed to do this is
[1:26:04] the way i supposed to be
[1:26:06] every move of god and everybody that's
[1:26:09] blessed of god to walk in the
[1:26:10] supernatural
[1:26:12] amen they don't count themselves worthy
[1:26:14] of it
[1:26:17] everybody that god uses don't even count
[1:26:20] themselves worthy
[1:26:21] no matter how good they can play an
[1:26:23] instrument no matter how well they can
[1:26:25] sing
[1:26:25] they just don't even see or ex
[1:26:29] lord i'm not worthy of it
[1:26:33] but when we hear i can do this better
[1:26:36] i am exhausted i suppose
[1:26:40] you know you're in the way brother
[1:26:44] you're in the waist system all of that
[1:26:47] eye
[1:26:47] amen all of that you think of yourself
[1:26:50] more highly than you are too
[1:26:52] amen none of us amen don't deserve god's
[1:26:54] goodness and god's grace
[1:26:56] amen that that's from the pulpit to the
[1:26:59] back door
[1:27:00] we're not worthy amen but god amen
[1:27:04] happens to do what he wants to do
[1:27:07] and we might as well say god i yield to
[1:27:10] you
[1:27:11] and i'm satisfied with what you do
[1:27:14] and in your own season and there's a
[1:27:16] plan and there's a purpose
[1:27:18] for my life god you will identify
[1:27:21] and you will do it are you with me
[1:27:25] so brother and sister don't ever
[1:27:28] let anybody say something different
[1:27:31] because god knows them that are his
[1:27:35] amen and god will take care amen
[1:27:38] but lucifer exalts himself
[1:27:43] amen oh i can preach better than
[1:27:47] i could teach and i'm going to tell you
[1:27:49] something i've seen
[1:27:51] people think that well i am the eighth
[1:27:53] messenger
[1:27:54] i am this you know i and they don't say
[1:27:58] it they like that
[1:27:59] but they think that what they're
[1:28:00] bringing is more important than what
[1:28:02] madaka foreboard
[1:28:05] are you with me and they think that
[1:28:08] their ministry is so special that
[1:28:09] everybody got to hear them
[1:28:12] if you don't hear them then you you know
[1:28:14] you don't have it
[1:28:15] you're not raptured material because i
[1:28:17] got it
[1:28:18] brother i said the holy ghost got it you
[1:28:22] got to
[1:28:22] be sure certain you got the holy ghost
[1:28:25] be certain that the power of god is
[1:28:28] inside of you
[1:28:29] and that god is leading you according to
[1:28:32] his word
[1:28:33] not according to some group or some man
[1:28:36] but according to his word
[1:28:38] are you with me and that leadership
[1:28:41] is with all humility not pointing you to
[1:28:45] a group
[1:28:46] but point you to the word amen not point
[1:28:50] you to their own
[1:28:51] personal private interpretation but
[1:28:54] point you to the word
[1:28:56] are you what man but god has already
[1:28:58] vindicated what he wants us to know for
[1:29:00] this day
[1:29:01] are you with me god has already proven
[1:29:05] himself
[1:29:05] amen and vindicated the word that he's
[1:29:08] provided for us for this
[1:29:10] day amen so nobody has to come and say
[1:29:13] amen i put that explanation mark on it
[1:29:16] god already did it from heaven
[1:29:19] are you with me so the word of god is
[1:29:22] right and god has given us what we need
[1:29:24] to get out of here are you with me

[1:30:05] more of you and less of us
[1:30:09] that's what we want lord this flesh to
