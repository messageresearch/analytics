[34:28] and there was no water for the
[34:31] congregation and they gathered
[34:33] themselves together against Moses and
[34:35] against Aaron and spake and the people
[34:38] ched with Moses and spake saying with
[34:41] God that he that we had died when our
[34:45] Brethren died before the Lord and why ha
[34:48] he brought up the congregation of the
[34:51] Lord into this Wilderness that we and
[34:53] our cattle should die there and
[34:55] wherefore have ye made us to come out of
[34:58] Egypt to bring us in unto this evil
[35:01] place it is it is no place of seed or of
[35:06] figs or of vines or of pomegranates
[35:08] neither is there any water to drink and
[35:11] Moses and Aaron went from the presence
[35:13] of the assembly unto the door of the
[35:15] Tabernacle of the congregation and they
[35:17] fell upon their face their faces and the
[35:20] glory of the Lord appeared unto them and
[35:22] the Lord spake unto Moses saying take
[35:25] the rod and gather thou the assembly
[35:28] together thou and Aaron thy brother and
[35:30] speak ye unto the rock
[35:33] before their eyes and it shall be given
[35:36] forth his water and thou shalt bring
[35:38] forth to them water out of the rock so
[35:41] Thou shalt give the congregation and
[35:43] their Beast drink and Moses took the rod
[35:46] from before the Lord as he commanded him
[35:49] and the and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[35:51] congregation together before the Rock
[35:53] and said unto them here now ye Rebels
[35:56] must we fetch you water out of this rock
[35:59] and Moses lifted up his hands and with
[36:01] his Rod he smoked the rod The Rock twice
[36:05] and the water came out abundantly and
[36:07] the congregation drank and and their
[36:10] beasts also and the and the Lord spake
[36:12] unto Moses and Aaron because you believe
[36:16] not to sanctify me in the eyes of the
[36:19] children of Israel therefore ye shall
[36:23] not bring this congregation un the land
[36:25] which I have given thee this this is the
[36:28] water of meah and because the children
[36:31] of Israel stroll with the Lord and he
[36:34] was Sanctified in them amen God bless
[36:36] the reading of his word you may be
[36:39] seated tonight I'd like to speak on a
[36:42] little topic that I entitled the right
[36:45] response the right response and we see
[36:49] here where where the the children of
[36:51] Israel they were complaining to Moses
[36:53] they were complaining to their leader
[36:55] and they went to him and Moses went to
[36:56] God him and Aaron they went before God
[36:59] and God gave them a word and when he
[37:01] gave them a word Moses and them they
[37:04] came out and they did something that was
[37:06] contrary to what God said they did
[37:09] something that that God told them to
[37:11] speak to the Rock but that's not what
[37:14] Moses did Moses and Moses when he went
[37:18] cuz he got so Ang he got so flustered
[37:20] with the children that God had done so
[37:22] much for he got so agitated that he just
[37:26] took the Rock and he smoked the The
[37:28] Rock see but I asked the question did
[37:31] Moses have the right
[37:33] response see see many a times we get
[37:36] caught up with other people and and what
[37:38] they got going on and they put it on you
[37:40] and sometimes you'll come to your
[37:42] situation you'll come to your rock and
[37:44] do you speak to it or do you smite it
[37:47] thank you what is your response see they
[37:50] had they had something that God told
[37:52] them to do and what was their response
[37:54] when things when when things got tough
[37:56] what was their response when others came
[37:58] and talked all this negative stuff in
[38:00] their ears what was their response when
[38:02] they got agitated what was their
[38:04] response when things wasn't going the
[38:06] way that they wanted it to go in that
[38:08] moment but you see Moses he had a way
[38:12] that when it happened he there was a
[38:14] consequence to him striking that rock
[38:17] there was a consequence to him striking
[38:19] that rock and see his response had a
[38:21] consequence it was an unforeseen
[38:24] consequence he didn't know that God
[38:25] wasn't going to allow him to go in the
[38:26] Promised Land because he struck The Rock
[38:29] he probably could have went to God and
[38:30] said they was bothering
[38:32] me they was getting on my nerves they
[38:36] were saying all this all this this that
[38:38] and the other to me and that's why I
[38:40] stro struck the rock but you see his
[38:42] action had a
[38:44] consequence just because of how he
[38:46] responded in that moment to that
[38:48] situation had a consequence of him not
[38:50] making it in the promised land but you
[38:53] see you may have a response to a
[38:55] situation that you may think it has no
[38:57] conse consquence on me I can respond bad
[39:00] in this situation because there was so
[39:02] much going on I can respond this way
[39:05] because there was so much that I was
[39:07] dealing with in that moment but see this
[39:10] moment had a consequence where Moses and
[39:13] Aaron couldn't go in the promised land
[39:16] they died before they got in the
[39:18] promised land and I ask you what is your
[39:21] response do you have the right response
[39:24] when you put in difficult situations do
[39:27] do you have the right response when
[39:29] things get tough and things get rough do
[39:31] you have the right response when
[39:33] someone's saying something negative to
[39:35] you do you have the right response when
[39:38] when you get upset about five different
[39:40] things and somebody ask you a simple
[39:42] question I'm guilty of it
[39:45] myself where where you get so you don't
[39:48] even realize it that you bothered about
[39:50] five other things when you respond to
[39:52] that one question that's right and when
[39:54] it happens sometimes you the Lord got to
[39:56] check you and say what is your response
[39:59] the Lord got to come to you and say hey
[40:01] you didn't respond right and that's when
[40:02] you got to go quickly and say Lord I'm
[40:04] sorry and to that person I'm sorry for
[40:07] what I said it could have been the right
[40:09] thing to say but it was said in the
[40:11] wrong way and sometimes you can say the
[40:14] thing and is never received because of
[40:16] the the the the spirit that you have
[40:18] behind it it was the right words it was
[40:20] the right message but the spirit that
[40:22] you have behind it causes someone not to
[40:25] receive it it causes them to say you
[40:28] know I don't want nothing to deal do
[40:29] with that person cuz anytime something
[40:32] something get to a certain level a
[40:34] certain place they they they they act a
[40:37] certain way but that's not as Pastor
[40:40] said told me recently he said just
[40:42] because that's what's happening doesn't
[40:43] mean that's who you are and see
[40:46] sometimes God got to show it to you for
[40:48] yourself show you he got to put you in
[40:51] there so that you can see that I got the
[40:53] wrong response and sometime God allow
[40:55] you to come to a once tce tce three four
[40:58] times so that you can see yourself and
[41:00] realize I had the wrong
[41:02] response but see in this situation he
[41:04] only had one
[41:06] chance come on so you never know which
[41:09] response is going to cause God to say
[41:11] that was the
[41:13] one say he said later on he said before
[41:16] what I stand at the door and knock If
[41:18] any man open the door and come with me
[41:21] and I and I would let him sck with him
[41:23] as the scripture said summarizing but
[41:25] you see sometimes it's the it's the
[41:28] smallest thing that can have the
[41:30] greatest impact it's the smallest moment
[41:33] that has the greatest impact like the
[41:35] scripture says as you've done to the
[41:37] least of these you did it unto me as you
[41:41] might have done to the stranger on the
[41:43] street you did it unto me cuz sometime
[41:45] the Lord allowed them to be angels
[41:47] unaware and you didn't even realize you
[41:49] was doing that to to one of God's
[41:52] servants but you was having a moment as
[41:54] you say go ahead and and thought that
[41:57] that was okay that this response was
[41:59] okay In This Moment cuz I was dealing
[42:01] with this that and the other that
[42:03] doesn't make it okay that doesn't make
[42:06] that that that moment that that response
[42:09] doesn't make it okay amen and so you
[42:11] have to say Lord I need you to work on
[42:13] me see you got to go to God and say Lord
[42:16] there you're showing me that there's a
[42:18] little more work that's got to be done
[42:19] in me Lord there's a little bit cleaner
[42:22] I need to get Lord there's a little bit
[42:24] more that I need you to shape up and
[42:26] mold and and break this apart and break
[42:28] it back down and mold something else in
[42:31] this place Lord because Lord I want to
[42:33] have the right response you never seen
[42:36] Jesus slip up and I guarantee you he
[42:39] went through way more than you
[42:41] have you never seen him ever had had the
[42:45] wrong thing to
[42:46] say and the scripture says that you want
[42:49] to be just like him and if you want to
[42:52] be just like him then then something got
[42:54] to change something got to change in the
[42:57] inside that you can have that right
[42:59] response no matter whether you high or
[43:01] whether you low no matter whether you
[43:03] going through something or you having a
[43:05] greatest time in life it doesn't matter
[43:07] your response shouldn't
[43:09] change and if you want to check and see
[43:11] if my response is right all you got to
[43:13] go do is look just go look there's an
[43:16] example somewhere that you can follow
[43:18] and say okay that that applies to me
[43:22] many times if you don't know cuz you
[43:23] probably ain't read it so you have to
[43:26] read it to search it out and figure it
[43:28] out for yourself to know what's in there
[43:30] to know what's in there so I can have
[43:32] the right response I said I was I was
[43:35] reading and I thought about the story of
[43:37] Elijah in Second
[43:40] Kings in second Kings chapter chapter
[43:51] 2 in 2 Kings chapter 2 and I start in
[43:54] verse 23
[44:00] let start in
[44:02] verse verse 19 actually and he said and
[44:06] the men of the city said unto elishah
[44:08] behold I pray thee the situation of this
[44:10] city is pleasant as my Lord seeth excuse
[44:14] me and the but the water is not and the
[44:16] ground Barren and he said bring me a new
[44:18] cruise and put salt therein and they
[44:21] brought it to him and he went forth into
[44:23] the spring of waters and cast the salt
[44:26] in there and said thus sayth the Lord I
[44:28] have healed these Waters there shall not
[44:31] be from then any more death of barren
[44:34] land so the waters were healed unto this
[44:36] day according to the saying of Elisha
[44:39] which he which he spake and he went from
[44:42] then unto bethl and he was going up by
[44:45] the way there came forth little
[44:48] children out of the city and mocked him
[44:51] and said unto him go up thou ballal head
[44:54] go up thou ballal head see even you are
[44:57] not immune to being picked
[45:00] on and some somebody said that they may
[45:03] justify how they respond because of
[45:06] what's happening to them and say you
[45:09] know he was getting picked on let's see
[45:11] what he did verse 24 he and he turned
[45:14] back and looked on them and cursed them
[45:17] in the name of the Lord and there came
[45:19] forth two she Bears out of the wood and
[45:22] tear 40 and2 children of them look how
[45:26] he responded someone said he had a bald
[45:29] head when you think about it like that
[45:31] you said
[45:33] man that was enough to get cursed by God
[45:37] as
[45:38] children it didn't say adults he said
[45:40] children and 42 got killed by two bears
[45:44] because of he was getting picked on and
[45:47] he went forth from then to mount Cara
[45:49] and from thence he returned to Samaria
[45:51] and you see how this happened right
[45:54] after God had done something miraculous
[45:57] it wasn't like this was this just came
[45:59] out of the blue this happened after God
[46:00] had just changed the water and made it
[46:03] healthy for them to drink and it's been
[46:05] that way ever since that's what the
[46:06] Bible says and then right after that
[46:08] somebody came and picked
[46:10] on sometimes your greatest Trials come
[46:13] right after God does your greatest
[46:14] blessing yes yes and right after that
[46:17] that's when all this negative people
[46:19] start talking this that and the other oh
[46:21] God un bless you they think that they so
[46:24] much better than everybody else or or or
[46:27] this that and the other but right after
[46:29] that is what is your response to it what
[46:32] is what is that what is that doing for
[46:34] you cuz you have a choice in that moment
[46:37] you have a choice in that moment to say
[46:39] you know what I'm not even going to
[46:40] follow that up cuz God done been too
[46:43] good to me is that simple but in that
[46:46] moment the longer you sit there and
[46:48] think about it it becomes a personal
[46:51] attack to you and some of it is all in
[46:54] your mind and it's all in your mind
[46:57] where the devil is using that to get to
[46:59] you cuz he know that if he can distract
[47:02] you then you not going to be looking at
[47:04] God to do something greater you're not
[47:06] going to be looking it's going to take
[47:07] you longer to get to where God wants you
[47:09] to be because you got distracted about
[47:12] what this one said and that one said or
[47:15] this happened to me and that happened to
[47:16] me and see in that moment God is looking
[47:19] for you to elevate he's looking for you
[47:21] to say you know what that don't mean
[47:23] that much what you saying ain't got
[47:26] nothing to do with me because God is
[47:27] still good to me and see when you start
[47:30] to get that mindset things start
[47:32] changing it allow you to be in a better
[47:34] head space for
[47:36] yourself you start smiling more you
[47:39] start not walking around with your head
[47:41] down one one of my friends said your
[47:43] crown
[47:45] slipping said sometime you walk around
[47:47] your crown slipping and it's a real
[47:49] thing that I think about sometime when
[47:51] my head go down I say you know what my
[47:53] Crown's slipping and when your Crown's
[47:55] slipping you you you start thinking
[47:57] about that thing you know what I got a
[47:58] Crown of Life I got a crown that's
[48:00] greater than anything that's over here
[48:03] and I can hold my head down or I can
[48:04] look up and say you know what this is
[48:06] something precious that God has given to
[48:08] me this is something great that God has
[48:10] given to me and I don't have a reason to
[48:12] let my head be
[48:14] down say it may go down but it need to
[48:17] come back up see there there's something
[48:20] that you understand what is my
[48:22] response I understand that I could have
[48:25] this response and I could stay there but
[48:28] what good is that going to do me I could
[48:31] stay there and wallow there and the
[48:33] devil make it a nice comfortable
[48:36] place it's like it's like the nest with
[48:38] the they say the Eagles the baby stay
[48:40] there cuz it's nice and comfortable but
[48:43] eventually when it's time for that eagle
[48:44] to grow up the the the mother Eagle
[48:47] starts getting thorns and thistles and
[48:50] making that place not nice to be and
[48:53] sometimes God got to come Stir It Up so
[48:55] it's not nice cuz otherwise you would
[48:57] stay there and say that's good enough
[49:00] I'm satisfied where I am I'm satisfied
[49:03] where I am but when God goes to stirring
[49:05] up that nest and things get
[49:08] uncomfortable things don't don't seem to
[49:10] be working how you thought they would
[49:12] work these people that always work with
[49:15] me good now they now they got something
[49:17] bad to say I've been working with them
[49:19] for the last three months and they ain't
[49:21] heard every a bad word and here come
[49:24] this this thing that we got to work on
[49:26] and here they come I just had as a prime
[49:29] example I was working in a class and in
[49:31] this class the teacher put us in teams
[49:34] and and we work with the team the whole
[49:36] semester so from August to
[49:39] December and in the in this in this
[49:42] situation I had two other it was me and
[49:44] two other guys we had a wonderful
[49:47] working relationship everything in the
[49:49] projects was getting done and everybody
[49:51] was working together then we came to
[49:53] this
[49:54] presentation Lord have mercy
[49:59] so all of a sudden one of the teammates
[50:01] decid you know what I'm going I did this
[50:04] part and y'all do the other part so I'm
[50:06] working on the other part and this other
[50:08] guy he he show up at the last minute to
[50:10] work on work with me to get this stuff
[50:12] done and when we finally get the
[50:15] presentation done we we try to share it
[50:18] with our teammate and say hey we got to
[50:20] give we got to give a standing
[50:22] presentation we got to give something on
[50:23] the screen and we got to give it we got
[50:25] to speak with this present ation and
[50:28] then the president was like well I don't
[50:29] want to speak so I emailed the professor
[50:32] I said um what would you like with the
[50:35] group members is everybody had to speak
[50:36] the professor said everybody got to
[50:38] speak so I said oh
[50:41] Lord and and and it starts to bother you
[50:44] because and then we got done the
[50:45] presentation you know what the person
[50:47] said they said this ain't even sea level
[50:52] work now you done stayed of all night
[50:55] trying to fix something and when you ask
[50:58] them to give their input they say this
[51:00] is about sea Lev worthy
[51:02] wow now
[51:07] imagine I'm just going to be honest and
[51:11] human yes sir if that don't affect you
[51:14] then I don't know cuz it it affected me
[51:19] it did and I and I got to looking I'm
[51:21] just like how can it be like now we just
[51:23] did all this work and said because they
[51:25] was looking at other people did
[51:28] it now mind you they had never we had
[51:30] never given a presentation in person so
[51:33] they had never seen that part of the
[51:35] presentation and I said there's two
[51:37] parts to the grade like you do what you
[51:39] do up there and then you got to
[51:41] talk well I I'm blessed with what God
[51:45] gave me so I understood I I ain't have
[51:47] no problem with having with talking in
[51:49] the presentation so when we got and we
[51:52] were first up the next morning we was
[51:55] the first one in the class to get a
[51:56] presentation so I'm just like we don't
[51:59] me and the other God we practiced the
[52:01] presentation and we knew exactly what
[52:03] each other was going to say but we got
[52:04] someone else that has to speak but we
[52:07] don't know what they going to
[52:09] say so we got to choose what we want
[52:12] them to say and how we want them to say
[52:14] it and there's a whole lot of prayer
[52:16] going on Lord give us
[52:17] wisdom because it this grade was not
[52:21] just you amen amen sometimes you work in
[52:24] things where it's not just it ain't just
[52:26] you
[52:27] am amen and it's not just you that's got
[52:29] to get it done it's everybody got to
[52:32] come together and sometimes we get on
[52:35] well I'm going to do my part and however
[52:37] yours turn out is how yours turn out see
[52:40] you can't get that mindset and God don't
[52:42] want you to get that
[52:44] mindset say see see sometimes you got to
[52:46] work together and I said we done work
[52:49] from August to December and everything
[52:51] was working
[52:53] good and so you get now you like where
[52:56] is this coming from like you questioning
[52:58] yourself like where is this coming but
[53:00] we get a presentation in class and the
[53:03] Lord bless us and we have it and after
[53:05] class he like oh that was a level work
[53:08] right
[53:10] there now you mad again cuz you just
[53:14] like you ain't never seen us so you
[53:16] would never know that that this is
[53:18] somebody strength or this is somebody
[53:21] weakness but now now you looking at it
[53:23] and you saying it's all in how you
[53:25] respond cuz I could have the other guy
[53:27] he was getting upset cuz we asked to
[53:29] meet on on at this time I can't meet
[53:31] today we asked to meet at this time I
[53:33] can't meet today um we asked to meet
[53:36] before class we was going to show up
[53:37] early before class he said I can't meet
[53:39] now now we know he show up to class
[53:42] every time early for class all of us
[53:44] know that like we show up he already in
[53:46] the
[53:47] classroom and then we get a presentation
[53:50] and everything go well like to the point
[53:53] people was giving us compliments about
[53:54] the presentation and and and he said nah
[53:57] that's a level work and then couple days
[54:00] later the professor give us the grade
[54:01] for the project the Lord bless us we met
[54:04] hey we made a perfect
[54:06] score that that was the blessing he
[54:09] going to text the group chat phenomenal
[54:12] job the other person in the group going
[54:14] to text me did he say
[54:16] phenomenal I said listen sometimes it's
[54:19] all about how you respond because if I
[54:22] would have went at him we might have had
[54:25] a bad presentation
[54:27] because there would have been spirits in
[54:28] the room in the atmosphere with us going
[54:31] back and forth I said I'm not treating
[54:33] them any different than how I treated
[54:34] them all the rest of the semester and we
[54:37] had a good see God can work out all
[54:39] those things that you over there and you
[54:41] getting upset about in the moment yes
[54:43] you can get
[54:44] upset because it affects you it does
[54:48] affect you but that doesn't mean you got
[54:49] to stay that way that doesn't mean you
[54:51] got to take it out on somebody else
[54:54] sometimes you got to go go to God and
[54:56] say said Lord Hey listen if this was a
[54:58] situation in the past I don't want it to
[55:00] be in my
[55:00] future Lord I don't want this to come up
[55:03] again so the next time I'm working with
[55:05] someone I know how to respond sometimes
[55:07] just go about and say you know I got to
[55:09] do the best that I can and try to figure
[55:11] out a way to navigate this because
[55:13] everybody that you work with not going
[55:15] to be somebody you like working with
[55:17] everybody that you going to have to work
[55:19] with in life not going to be somebody
[55:20] that you upstanding but you going to
[55:23] have to figure out how to navigate it
[55:25] and when God allows you to have the
[55:27] right response he'll give you wisdom for
[55:29] how to deal with that situation he'll
[55:31] give you wisdom so that you can
[55:33] understand that you know all things work
[55:35] together to the
[55:37] good see just because you can have the
[55:40] right response God can bless everybody
[55:42] around you so you never know that God
[55:45] just decided to give us grace and favor
[55:47] just because you had the right
[55:49] response Hallelujah just because you had
[55:52] the right response God said you know
[55:54] what I'm going to make sure the
[55:55] professor give y'all a good
[55:58] and then we ended up me and this other
[56:00] guy we was we was really stressed about
[56:02] it cuz we was calculating our grade and
[56:04] we was trying to we needed a perfect
[56:06] score to get our
[56:08] a so we knew that we had to do this well
[56:12] and I came now I said it doesn't have to
[56:14] look like everybody else because we're
[56:16] not everybody else and see everybody
[56:19] they look at they want it a certain way
[56:21] but sometime that ain't the way God made
[56:23] you so you can't do it the way everybody
[56:24] else did it don't mean that their way is
[56:27] better than your way it just mean that
[56:30] God made us
[56:31] different and see I can only respond how
[56:34] God allowed me to respond and just
[56:36] because you responded your way doesn't
[56:38] mean that your way was wrong and my way
[56:40] was right it just mean that God made us
[56:43] different as long as it's not contrary
[56:45] to the word I got to put that in there
[56:49] cuz somebody might use that as a
[56:52] loophole said you said yeah uhuh see
[56:56] it's all about having the right response
[56:58] but your response got to come through
[56:59] the word of God and make sure that you
[57:02] know when you when you give that
[57:03] response you ain't saying it with malice
[57:06] you're not saying it with no no no
[57:08] hidden thing behind it you actually
[57:10] giving a true response cuz you want God
[57:12] to be pleased with it amen see God going
[57:16] to hold you accountable for how you
[57:19] responded right see that that's what you
[57:22] that's what you have to look at and say
[57:24] how am I responding and how is God going
[57:26] to look at it when he looks at
[57:28] me and said I I I realized that and said
[57:32] I believe the other person like the Lord
[57:33] blessed me to get a A in that class just
[57:36] because of that and I said you know I
[57:38] think about it I said it's a small thing
[57:40] to somebody but it was a big thing to me
[57:44] cuz I cuz at the moment you get upset
[57:47] with this and it really affect you
[57:49] because I've been in other situations
[57:51] where people have went behind your back
[57:52] and talked about you and said you didn't
[57:55] do this you didn't do that and and and
[57:57] it might have caused an effect a
[57:59] profound effect on you in in your
[58:02] grades but you see I said when I came to
[58:05] this one I said I'm not going to follow
[58:07] that up I'm going to go and do what I
[58:09] need to do and do the best that we can
[58:11] and lead the rest up to God and see that
[58:14] was my response to it and said when you
[58:16] come to that
[58:18] situation amen when you come to it how
[58:21] will you
[58:22] respond and I only told that as a
[58:25] testimony to give give to God praise and
[58:27] see and show you that sometimes it's all
[58:30] about how you respond it's all about
[58:32] what you bring forth and how you go to
[58:34] that person and how you treat
[58:37] them cuz cuz when it look back at it the
[58:40] person that looks wrong is going to be
[58:42] you not them right it's going to be you
[58:47] and then and then it's going to look
[58:48] like y'all got a problem with something
[58:50] that's very small that's very very very
[58:53] small whether we got it or not was all
[58:56] in God's hands in the first place but
[58:59] God wanted to sometimes put you in
[59:00] situation that you would have to be
[59:02] exposed to it so that he'll see what
[59:04] your response
[59:06] is cuz he know that if you can respond
[59:08] right in thisen when the tests get
[59:11] harder and they become more on the line
[59:13] than just a grade it might come to down
[59:16] to the line where it's your job where
[59:18] you have bills to pay where you got
[59:21] things to do that you know that you you
[59:23] got to have this job and then it's going
[59:25] to be a situation where God allow you
[59:27] and you put in there and God going to
[59:29] see how you going to
[59:31] respond and see God allows you to go
[59:34] through those things to show you that
[59:36] you can have you can have the right
[59:39] response and when you have that right
[59:41] response he'll do he can do more than
[59:43] you thought he could do he he can make
[59:46] the ways plain and the way smooth just
[59:49] because you had the right response just
[59:52] because see if Moses I wonder if Moses
[59:54] then would have had the right response
[59:56] they would have went into the land of
[59:57] flowing with milk and honey that's right
[59:59] it just he had just spoke to the Rock
[1:00:01] something so simple but when we and and
[1:00:05] you see what Elijah did when someone
[1:00:06] went to picking at
[1:00:08] him
[1:00:09] and and and I thought about I said
[1:00:13] sometimes the things that are magnified
[1:00:15] in the moment are not that big when you
[1:00:17] look at the big picture sometimes the
[1:00:20] thing that's going on in the moment is
[1:00:22] not that big when you look at the big
[1:00:24] picture but sometimes we looking looking
[1:00:27] at the thing that's right in front of us
[1:00:29] we don't see the big picture we don't
[1:00:31] see what God is trying to do behind the
[1:00:33] scenes and sometime God don't show you
[1:00:36] he just wants you to respond the right
[1:00:38] way in that moment he don't show you the
[1:00:40] end of the staircase he might just show
[1:00:42] you the next step that's it and
[1:00:44] sometimes he don't show you the next
[1:00:45] step he just reach out his hand and say
[1:00:47] trust me he don't even show you the next
[1:00:50] step and said when when you got to have
[1:00:53] the right response in that moment to say
[1:00:55] Lord I just trust you and take the step
[1:00:57] of faith and go on and you never know
[1:01:01] why God is telling you cuz you know what
[1:01:03] if he would have show you that that next
[1:01:05] step was actually two or three steps and
[1:01:07] there was two or three steps missing you
[1:01:09] wouldn't have took it cuz you would have
[1:01:11] got scared you would have said it's too
[1:01:13] far for me to go you would have said I
[1:01:16] can't do it all these seeds are doubt
[1:01:18] but God just reach out his hand and say
[1:01:20] trust me and he'll lift you all the way
[1:01:22] up he'll lift you and put you in places
[1:01:25] that only he could do and others will
[1:01:27] Marvel and said and Marvel and say how
[1:01:30] did you get here and they'll come to you
[1:01:33] and you'll say it was nothing but the
[1:01:34] grace of
[1:01:36] God it was nothing but the grace of God
[1:01:40] I start to look back at certain things
[1:01:41] and I realized in my own life that I'm
[1:01:44] only where I am because of the grace of
[1:01:46] God and when I realized that you know
[1:01:48] what God allowed me to be here because
[1:01:50] he wanted to put me in situation that I
[1:01:52] don't even know where he's taking me I
[1:01:55] don't even understand where he's taking
[1:01:57] me and why I have to go the route that I
[1:01:59] have to go but in those moments when God
[1:02:02] put it before me I have to have the
[1:02:04] right response I have to say Lord I
[1:02:06] trust you that no matter what you're
[1:02:08] doing I know that you're going to lead
[1:02:10] me to where you want me to be and when I
[1:02:13] get there maybe I understand as the song
[1:02:15] said better buy and byy but if I don't
[1:02:18] that doesn't worry me at all because I
[1:02:20] realize that where you place me is where
[1:02:22] you want me to
[1:02:24] be it's about my response when the
[1:02:27] things get
[1:02:29] hard because just CU he got you on a
[1:02:31] path to where he wants you to go don't
[1:02:33] mean it's going to be easy don't mean
[1:02:35] that things ain't going to happen where
[1:02:37] you going to have to go through
[1:02:38] situations where God is going to say I'm
[1:02:40] trying to show you that you got to get
[1:02:42] tougher so I can give you
[1:02:45] more amen like I got to take you through
[1:02:47] this because what's coming in the future
[1:02:49] is going to be harder than this and you
[1:02:51] got to understand that if I brought you
[1:02:53] through this I can take you through that
[1:02:55] amen amen amen and and see I understand
[1:02:59] that it's about your response in
[1:03:01] everything that you do amen but if God
[1:03:04] has it all in control you can trust that
[1:03:06] if I got the right response God is going
[1:03:08] to see this through amen I don't know
[1:03:10] how he going to work it out I don't know
[1:03:12] how he going to fix it I don't know how
[1:03:15] he going to do the things that he
[1:03:16] promised that he would do but somehow
[1:03:19] some way it's going to
[1:03:21] happen just cuz all I did was had the
[1:03:23] right response and say Lord I trust you
[1:03:25] amen and when I went to you and told you
[1:03:27] lord it's getting too hard for me I know
[1:03:29] that you wouldn't put more than I could
[1:03:31] bear so even when I'm going through I
[1:03:33] can turn to him and say Lord lift me up
[1:03:37] and let me stand and Lord plant my feet
[1:03:39] on higher ground see God can do those
[1:03:41] things all if you had a right response
[1:03:44] amen but when you have the wrong
[1:03:46] response it can lead you down a pathway
[1:03:49] that you that that you never thought
[1:03:51] just because you having a wrong
[1:03:54] response thank you Jesus and see see and
[1:03:58] just because like I I I was reading this
[1:04:01] and it started to I started to
[1:04:03] understand it more and more and I I went
[1:04:05] started thinking about the story of
[1:04:06] Esther and how she had the right
[1:04:09] response and and what she did and her
[1:04:11] response was say let's go pray let's go
[1:04:14] pray cuz this thing is greater than me
[1:04:17] amen this thing is greater than you this
[1:04:19] thing is greater than all of us together
[1:04:22] but if we all go to God she didn't just
[1:04:24] say let me pray
[1:04:26] she didn't say let let me and my people
[1:04:28] pray she said I want you to spread the
[1:04:30] word to everybody fast and pray
[1:04:33] everybody together cuz she understood
[1:04:35] that this thing wasn't an attack on me
[1:04:37] this thing wasn't an attack on you it
[1:04:39] was an attack on all of us and when she
[1:04:42] came to that response and and I liked it
[1:04:44] because when I was reading I said you
[1:04:45] know what her response was to hymon she
[1:04:47] didn't go to the king and say I want him
[1:04:50] dead she said I invite y'all to come
[1:04:53] eat not once
[1:04:58] I think she did it she did multiple
[1:05:00] times now can you imagine having your
[1:05:02] enemy there in the room with you know
[1:05:06] that they hate you know that they want
[1:05:08] to kill you know that they want to take
[1:05:10] your position and say come on over and
[1:05:12] eat at my
[1:05:14] house now how many of us would have that
[1:05:17] response how many of us would say you
[1:05:20] know I'm in a place that I I I I can
[1:05:23] invite this person over to my house even
[1:05:25] though they don't like
[1:05:26] me I can invite this coworker over to my
[1:05:29] house even though I know they talking
[1:05:30] about
[1:05:31] me I I can I can do something nice for
[1:05:34] them because just because I see that
[1:05:36] they need
[1:05:38] it because but I know that they talking
[1:05:41] about me and they saying all this and
[1:05:43] they doing I know this to be true Esther
[1:05:47] knew what type of person hmon was but
[1:05:50] yet she didn't let that stop her from
[1:05:52] doing something for him bless
[1:05:56] now hmon could have came to Esther and
[1:05:57] repented of all that and maybe it would
[1:05:59] have spared his life and his family but
[1:06:02] that's not what he did he got more
[1:06:05] jealous he got more ingratiated he got
[1:06:08] more upset about it to eventually es
[1:06:11] said this man is coming against me and
[1:06:13] my family and me and my people and the
[1:06:16] King had he couldn't change his word but
[1:06:18] he made a provision of a way of Escape
[1:06:21] for them and he told them if y'all
[1:06:23] attack them they can fight you and see
[1:06:26] and ain't nobody ain't nobody came
[1:06:28] against them like that but they made
[1:06:30] sure that hmon and his family they they
[1:06:32] they came against them and they were
[1:06:34] wiped out see God has a way that even
[1:06:37] though you can't see how you going to
[1:06:40] escape even though you can't understand
[1:06:42] how how you're going to escape cuz this
[1:06:44] decree was unreversed that was the law
[1:06:48] it was unreversed
[1:06:52] and because like Mori said how do you
[1:06:54] know that God ain't put you in this
[1:06:56] place for such a time as
[1:06:59] this how do you know that God had been
[1:07:01] building you up and taking you through
[1:07:03] things from your youth from your
[1:07:05] childhood to put you in a place for such
[1:07:07] a time as this how do you know that God
[1:07:10] ain't been preparing you and allowed you
[1:07:12] to get to where you are for such a time
[1:07:15] as
[1:07:17] thisall but you see she could have had
[1:07:20] the wrong response and said you know
[1:07:22] what I'm going to try to take my chances
[1:07:23] by myself
[1:07:26] she could have but that's not what she
[1:07:28] did she said I'm coming not on the
[1:07:30] behalf of me but behalf of all those
[1:07:32] that are with me all those that I may
[1:07:35] know and may not know I'm coming on the
[1:07:37] behalf of them she didn't just go for
[1:07:39] Mori she went for all the Jews amen amen
[1:07:42] people that she didn't even know she
[1:07:44] went to them and said not don't don't
[1:07:46] just spare spare me but provide a
[1:07:48] provision for all of them she was
[1:07:50] standing in the gap for all of them that
[1:07:53] was her response amen she had the right
[1:07:56] response and God spared him God didn't
[1:07:59] let no harm come to him because that he
[1:08:02] he would never leave them nor forsake
[1:08:04] them God had chosen them and he had put
[1:08:07] a way of Escape in there so that Esther
[1:08:10] could make it there so that she can
[1:08:11] stand for her people he did the same
[1:08:14] thing with Joseph but Joseph had to go
[1:08:17] through a whole lot to get there but in
[1:08:19] all those times that he was going
[1:08:20] through he had the right response he had
[1:08:23] the right response amen and if you was
[1:08:26] look and and and if you was looking for
[1:08:28] a reason why should I have the right
[1:08:31] response that's a reason cuz every time
[1:08:34] you had the right response God blessed
[1:08:36] it every time they had the right
[1:08:38] response God blessed it God allowed them
[1:08:41] even though the trials in Joseph life
[1:08:43] seem to intensify it got worse every
[1:08:46] single time he had the right response he
[1:08:49] told the truth about his brothers he get
[1:08:51] thrown in the
[1:08:53] pit he he he get thrown in the P then he
[1:08:56] get slowed into slavery then he work up
[1:08:58] to the highest position in part of her
[1:09:00] house and then the wife lie on him then
[1:09:02] he get sent to
[1:09:03] jail he get in jail he get to the get
[1:09:06] favored in the jail and then he told
[1:09:09] some people they dreams and they forgot
[1:09:11] about him that's right don't it seem
[1:09:14] like he going to the worst of the worst
[1:09:16] of the worst every time he go somewhere
[1:09:18] it's a demotion not an
[1:09:22] elevation and you and and and but but at
[1:09:25] the end he ended up second in command of
[1:09:27] pharaoh am but don't you think he he
[1:09:31] thought about it now why am I going
[1:09:32] through
[1:09:35] this why every time I do something right
[1:09:38] it seemed like something wrong happened
[1:09:40] to
[1:09:42] me why every time I do something to tell
[1:09:44] people the truth seem like something I
[1:09:47] go to something
[1:09:48] worse but see he he didn't see the end
[1:09:51] of the the line but God knew where he
[1:09:54] was going to end up amen see he had to
[1:09:56] take him through all of that so that he
[1:09:58] could save his family amen just think of
[1:10:01] the extreme things that God took him
[1:10:03] through just for his family sake amen
[1:10:06] that was the whole purpose that he could
[1:10:09] save his family from famine that God
[1:10:12] could allow them to to be in such a way
[1:10:14] that he elevated him and blessed him
[1:10:16] above anything that they probably ever
[1:10:18] could imagined
[1:10:20] amen that it saved not only them but all
[1:10:22] of Egypt from death amen just because
[1:10:25] because God wanted to place him
[1:10:27] there and all during that he had the
[1:10:29] right response so the question is what
[1:10:32] is your
[1:10:33] response when things get seem to get
[1:10:36] rough and things seem to get tough what
[1:10:38] is your response because in that moment
[1:10:41] you have a choice you have a choice and
[1:10:44] sometime the response ain't the fight
[1:10:47] amen sometimes you think it's fight or
[1:10:49] flight it's neither one of those
[1:10:51] sometime God just want you to just want
[1:10:53] you to be still and know
[1:10:56] in that moment he just wants you to be
[1:10:57] still and let him go ahead and talk and
[1:11:00] then go on about it and if you got to go
[1:11:02] and say Lord I Lord I need you right now
[1:11:05] and by yourself and you got to say those
[1:11:07] prayers because that was the response
[1:11:09] that was necessary cuz if you had
[1:11:12] responded it would have escalated it not
[1:11:14] deescalate but escalated the situation
[1:11:17] and God wants you to say you know what
[1:11:19] I'm going to choose to respond the right
[1:11:21] way it might be something simple it
[1:11:24] might be something something great but
[1:11:26] in the end of the day is it worth it see
[1:11:29] I I got something greater and a greater
[1:11:31] purpose than than going through this
[1:11:33] right now and and following someone up
[1:11:36] and going through they foolishness I got
[1:11:38] there's a greater purpose here and if I
[1:11:40] follow it up then I'm going to be just
[1:11:42] like you we going to be right here on
[1:11:44] the same boat no no and but God got
[1:11:48] something greater for me so in order for
[1:11:50] me to get there I got to go through this
[1:11:53] and when I go through this it might be
[1:11:54] something else but you know what all in
[1:11:56] that process God is elevating me God is
[1:11:59] allowing me to see you know what he got
[1:12:01] more for me than I thought amen I might
[1:12:03] have got I might have got compac right
[1:12:05] here that's why God had to Stir It Up
[1:12:07] cuz he want there's more for me than I
[1:12:09] thought there's more for me than I
[1:12:11] thought that I I could imagine right now
[1:12:14] but there's more for me amen and just
[1:12:16] realizing that I said you know what I
[1:12:18] got to change how I respond I got to
[1:12:21] change how I respond cuz when I'm
[1:12:23] responding this way it don't get better
[1:12:25] amen it just get
[1:12:27] worse when when I get elevated and
[1:12:30] raised up it don't get better it just
[1:12:31] get worse not for them for me amen and
[1:12:35] when I re and when you realize that
[1:12:37] things start to change for you but it
[1:12:39] ain't Until you realize it people can
[1:12:42] tell you mama and daddy sister and
[1:12:43] brother can tell you but when you
[1:12:45] realize it it start to change how you
[1:12:47] are and and it's really sometimes it's
[1:12:50] necessary cuz God wants to put you in
[1:12:52] places that you never thought that you
[1:12:54] would be but in order for you to get
[1:12:56] there you got to have the right response
[1:12:58] to the things that you going through and
[1:13:00] when you have those responses it allows
[1:13:02] you to God to use you as a light for
[1:13:05] someone else cuz you never know who was
[1:13:08] watching and seeing what you was going
[1:13:10] through amen and and they knew all the
[1:13:12] situ all the parts of the
[1:13:15] situation and say you know what that
[1:13:18] person different cuz if it was
[1:13:22] me and that's what they think about and
[1:13:25] they know that God there's something
[1:13:27] different about you there there's
[1:13:28] something that's standing out about you
[1:13:31] and that there has to be something and I
[1:13:33] want to figure out what that something
[1:13:35] is and sometimes it's not that you going
[1:13:38] to harvest the seed maybe you just
[1:13:39] planting the seed it's not that you may
[1:13:42] harvest the seed maybe you just watering
[1:13:44] the seed you never know if God allows
[1:13:46] you to cross over that gate who going to
[1:13:48] come and say you know what you was a
[1:13:50] light and you showed me that there was
[1:13:52] something better for me that's right
[1:13:54] amen amen
[1:13:55] just because of how you responded
[1:13:58] amen just want to encourage you tonight
[1:14:01] just to tell you that don't give up just
[1:14:04] because it looked Bleak and it looked
[1:14:06] hard in in the moment do not give up
[1:14:08] because you having the right response is
[1:14:11] having an effect you having the right
[1:14:14] response is having an effect and you
[1:14:16] might not even see the effect you may
[1:14:19] never know the effect that it is but you
[1:14:21] having the wrong response is having an
[1:14:23] effect too
[1:14:25] you you getting upset and all this stuff
[1:14:26] is having an effect too and it might be
[1:14:28] having an effect on you that's right
[1:14:31] that you can't see sometimes it takes
[1:14:34] other people to point it out to you and
[1:14:36] say hey you really you really um need to
[1:14:39] work on some
[1:14:41] things and it's true if you be honest
[1:14:44] with yourself you say you know what
[1:14:46] there's some things that I need to work
[1:14:47] on there's some things that Lord I need
[1:14:50] to get closer to you so you can draw
[1:14:52] this out of me that you can take this
[1:14:54] from me so Lord I can have the right
[1:14:57] response that no matter what situation I
[1:14:59] get in whether it's a pressure cooking
[1:15:01] situation I can have the right response
[1:15:04] amen cuz Jesus got there when he got on
[1:15:08] after not eating for 40 days and the
[1:15:10] devil tempted him so why not me if the
[1:15:13] devil can take Jesus through those
[1:15:15] things he can take me through those
[1:15:16] things but it was how Jesus responded
[1:15:20] that got him through that test it was
[1:15:22] how he responded that allowed him to
[1:15:24] overcome what the devil was trying to
[1:15:26] put in front of me and so if I if I can
[1:15:29] if I can have the right response I can
[1:15:31] overcome everything the devil tries to
[1:15:33] put in front of me if I can have the
[1:15:35] right response I can have a Victorious
[1:15:37] life if I can have the right response I
[1:15:40] can go and say Lord I understand that
[1:15:42] all of my help comes from you I can turn
[1:15:45] to him no matter what the what the
[1:15:47] situation is I can turn to him and
[1:15:49] realize that Lord you're going to bring
[1:15:51] me through Lord you're going to bring me
[1:15:53] through and I can continue live on that
[1:15:56] and continue to I seen you do it and I
[1:15:58] don't have to look to no further than in
[1:16:00] my own life I don't have to look to
[1:16:02] nobody else but what you've already done
[1:16:04] for me said it might be small to you but
[1:16:07] it was great to me and realizing that
[1:16:10] all I have to do is turn to you and said
[1:16:11] Lord I want to have the right response
[1:16:14] and know that you'll give me the right
[1:16:16] response you can put the words in my
[1:16:18] mouth that I don't even have amen that I
[1:16:21] look back and say you know that wasn't
[1:16:23] me
[1:16:23] talking and realize that there's a
[1:16:26] change that's happening there's
[1:16:28] something that's changing inside of me
[1:16:30] and I know that something got to change
[1:16:32] in order for me to make it in see it's
[1:16:35] got to be something that's changing cuz
[1:16:37] if you in the same place that you was a
[1:16:39] year ago then something is
[1:16:42] wrong something is wrong but God is
[1:16:45] showing us that hey if the hour is
[1:16:46] getting late then we should be getting
[1:16:49] closer if things are going on then we
[1:16:51] should be getting closer it's more of
[1:16:53] hey what what what is going on that I'm
[1:16:56] not getting closer to God how am I
[1:16:59] responding how am I how am I each and
[1:17:01] every day drawing nearer to him that's
[1:17:04] right because if I draw near to him he
[1:17:06] going to draw n to
[1:17:08] me amen
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:23] am praise the Lord Lord amen we thank
[1:17:26] God for the word tonight amen our
[1:17:29] response amen amen what do we say when
[1:17:33] Jesus takes us through trials and
[1:17:36] tests unconsciously and
[1:17:39] unaware how do we
[1:17:44] respond sometimes we don't even don't
[1:17:46] even know we've been tested until after
[1:17:49] the test is
[1:17:51] over and you don't know what God God is
[1:17:55] preparing us
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:17:58] for until you find out that you're
[1:18:02] stronger after you've been through amen
[1:18:06] even in your
[1:18:08] failure God is talking to you telling
[1:18:10] you something amen so sometimes you said
[1:18:14] I fail but you know you don't have to
[1:18:17] stay in that condition amen amen God can
[1:18:22] show you your failure only to tell you
[1:18:25] that this is not you I don't want you to
[1:18:28] be that am amen so we thank God for the
[1:18:33] word let's respond when God speaks to us
[1:18:38] and when we going through things let's
[1:18:40] have the right
[1:18:41] response
[1:18:43] Amen Let us just stand how many of
