ask that you just have your way tonight in Jesus name we pray amen if you have your Bibles tonight ask you to turn to First Peter three and 18 amen when you got it say amen amen and it reads actually let's start at the eth verse I got the wrong ver finally be ye all of One mind having compassion of one another love as Brethren be pitiful be C courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrarywise blessing knowing that ye are there unto called and the that ye should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no God let him assure evil and do good let him seek peace and UE ensue it for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are upon are open unto their prayers but the faith of the Lord is against them that do evil and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid and be not afraid of their Terrors neither be troubled but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ye ready always to give an answer to every man that ask your reason of the hope that is in you for with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you and as of evil doers they may be ashamed that falsely accus good conversation in Christ for it is better if the will of the of God be so that you suffer for well doing than for evil to him for Christ also has has once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit amen God bless the reading of this word you may be seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled maintaining your inte integrity maintain in your integrity but also as a little subtopic character character and this he points out here how if if you're doing the right thing there's a just reward for you if you're doing the right thing and you're listening to God's word there's a just reward for you it said that but it all comes down to your character and I ask you the question do you care what people say about you when people they look at you whether you like it or not whether you might be the quietest person in the room people are watching you cuz many of us have seen quiet people and we say you know that's a good person or you say man they could be quiet and Silent as a mouse but you say I wouldn't want to be around them it doesn't matter if you're quiet or if you loud and you speak a lot or you talk a lot your character is still speaking about you how you act how you react is also telling people who you are said it's from the intents of the heart that the mouth speaks so sometimes it's some things that are deep inside of you that are speaking out of your mouth that you was like is that me is that me but something is the inside of you that might come out every now and again that said Lord I got to get closer to you cuz Lord I want the right Integrity I don't want just an Integrity I want the right integrity and I want the right character see the Lord he speaks to us and he tells us what you should have what you should have and he gives it to us in in Galatians if we turn there in Galatians chapter 5 said if you have the right inte integrity and the right character in verse 22 it tells you what you should have and what should come out of you he said but the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness Temperance and against such there is no law and they that are that are Christ have crucified the F has crucified the flesh with the affections of lust see all of those things you're supposed to have as God is in you and they should be coming out of you that people can say you have a good character they can say it about you you might not have spoke a word but they know hey that's a good person that's a God-fearing person but you didn't say nothing to them maybe they just saw you pray over your food and they knew that you had a relationship with God they might not have seen you do nothing else but that was different to them CU there are some people that still haven't seen that they didn't grow up in a home where they saw that every day they they didn't grow up and go to school and they seen that every day where this person was the same person each and every day they came to school there was no differences when they came see sometimes we get and things do affect you life will affect you and sometimes you have to go to God and say Lord take this from me say sometimes I can remember in my own life where you struggle with maybe things that go against you you might have anger issues and you have to go to God and say Lord take this from me because I can't afford for this thing that to mess with the rest of my life you have to go to God and say and sometimes you got to spend time with God it ain't just coming to God and expecting it to happen you got to go over and over cuz that thing can come back on you brother Rand said if the devil he finds a spot that's that's your weak spot he got a right to come back to it so you got to be aware of that and go to God and say Lord I still need you to cover me even when I think I'm strong I got to get back down and say Lord I'm not as strong as I think I Am Lord I need your help and sometimes you might not even realize it until things start happening after you done the devil the wolf done got behind your enclosure and you ain't even realiz it cuz it looked like it was white but the wolf got back there the only way you knew is your sheep started dying and you was trying to figure out I closed the gate I thought it was all covered but it was a wolf in there and sometimes you got to find a way to get that wolf out but you know the best way to do is go to God and say Lord I don't know how it got in but Lord I need you to take it out I don't know how it might have entered but Lord I need you to come before me and take it out whether it's a bad attitude sometimes and sometimes you might not realize that you have one until other people tell you they telling you because they care about you and sometimes they might not even care but it don't mean that you shouldn't get rid of it they it doesn't mean cuz your enemy can tell you something and be like that that's getting on my nerves doesn't mean they wasn't right doesn't mean that they wasn't telling you there was something in your character that you needed to fix it was something in your character that you needed to get before God and said Lord change this because I realize it's not what what you said it was supposed to be it's not one of these fruits of the spirit that's coming out of me so if it's not it's not one of those it's not of you so Lord if I want to make it in I want everything that's not like you you take it out of me Lord everything that's not like you Lord remove it because I don't want that to be the hindrance just imagine you did everything right and the Lord turned you around and say you know what you had an anger issue you can't get in heaven just imagine you get to heaven and the Lord say you had a lion issue you can't come into heaven that was the thing that stopped you you might have thought about man I got this I got that and all these other things and and what if that's the thing that stops you what if you got to think of just taking that that few little dollars that you know somebody dropped on the ground but you saw when they dropped it what if that's the thing that stops you from going to heaven said what what do you think when people say about you do you care cuz many of times somebody might tell you something you be like I don't care but they are trying to help you sometimes and sometime God send that to you say hey let me get your attention because obviously you can't see it yourself so I got to send somebody to tell you what it is I got to send somebody to tell you what it is but bam he used the Donkey it had got so to a point of desperation that bam had removed everyone from around him he was by himself but he didn't realize that God could use the donkey he didn't realize after all the people was gone God still had a way to speak to him and when if you are his son and daughter God will speak to you by any means necessary God has a way of getting your attention God has a way of coming down to you and speak directly to you that you know is God that you know it ain't nobody else could know but God and when he speaks to you you know that something got to change and if you really want to God see it you want it to change you don't just you don't just want have it to happen to you you want it to change and whatever it's necessary for it to change you start working on it you start working on it it might not happen overnight but I tell you if you look back in the year you say I what I wanted to read something that said said a lady had a testimony and she said you know I ain't what I ought to be and she said I ain't what I what I want to be but she said one thing I'm sure I ain't what I used to be see sometimes you also want to have that testimony Lord I ain't where I want to be I might not be where I should be but Lord I ain't where I used to be so you got to have a growth you plant something in the ground and you don't see it grow you dig it up and you throw it away but you don't want God to do that to you God don't he gave you so much so that you can give it back to them at some point in time there has to be fruits for the labor at some point in time otherwise it's a wasted effort you can turn around and say why did I do that it was a waste of my time and energy if you do it over and over they said the the definition of insanity is doing something over and over and expecting a different result and sometimes we get to doing something we doing something and we think that we're doing it for a profit but it's not that's right we think that we doing something but Ain no fruits of it the Bible says when Jesus passed the pig tree and he came back and there's no fruit and he said he said basically cut it down to paraphrase it and get rid of the tree cuz the the tree is no good you want something that's living you want something that's growing you want something that Lord when people look at me I have the right reputation when people talk about me they have good things to say cuz it's nothing like I I used to say I said you know a good word might spread might spread to about five or 10 people but a bad word are sure multiply a bad word just one word that's ill will even if it's a lie on you will spread quicker than the truth and sometimes you have to some people don't give you the benefit of the doubt they don't give you a second chance but I know a God that always gives you second chances I know a God that said come to me all ye to heavy laden and heavy burden and I'll give you rest he said I'll take all your yolks and put on me and and he will take give you rest for your soul said that's what God wants to give you but it's asking the question do you want it it's a certain point for God to want to give it to you cuz he already gave it to you it's a gift but do you want it do you want it now there are things that you got to do to get it but it ain't nothing more than anything you can get out here it ain't nothing more than than just being good being a good person and doing these things that's what God asked you to do and just give your life to him that's what he wants that's all that he asked you for he didn't ask for everything else he said I can give you everything else but he just wants your life he wants you to say Lord I'm sold out to you and everything that I'm do I'm sold out to you Lord I want to see your glory working in my life Lord I want to see your your Holy Spirit coming out of my life Lord I want to see your love your joy your peace your longsuffering your kindness says sometimes you see a lot of people they aren't kind they only care about themselves and they and they treat everyone around them just like that I've seen it when working with different things and even going to school I said told someone recently said I have learned that I don't like working in groups anymore I have learned that but it's not because of the work it's because of the people that you're dealing with and sometimes you don't realize the difference with dealing with people that have some type of character or standard versus not that's right it's not until you are exposed to that to realize that some people really don't care and and only that they only care about themselves and then they don't take it personal you over there hurt broken up oh Lord what am I doing and they going about their life and you don't even realize it and sometime God allows these things to be test for you he allows these things to be a trial for you because he said I'm trying to show you something I'm trying to show you there's still a work to be done in your life even though you might have thought you was on this level let me show you where you really are they let me show you exactly so you can look in the mirror and see yourself say sometimes when you're going through certain things you don't want to see the mirror that's right you want to walk past it real quick or you don't want to be in a room with the mirror because you don't want to see yourself yourself because you know if you saw yourself you would do something about it you know if you saw yourself and really had a conversation where you sat down and stopped for one moment you aren't busy for one moment things would change because you would have to be honest with yourself but nobody can be honest with you more than you can be honest with yourself God can you can be walking into a brick wall over and over but until you realize you know what this is not a great way to do this to get over this wall walking straight into it you're not going to change what you're doing cuz sometimes you can also Bible say in the last times the Lord would give them over to a rep probate mind they might start believe in what they what they have in their mind and say Lord I don't ever want to get to that point see there's a point in time that you don't want to cross over to that to that level see God has a way that he but if you have God's character in you he'll lead you to the right things he'll lead you to the right truth he'll lead you and that he'll guide you each and every day each and every day that you wake up and you don't have Direction you can say Lord give me a direction today Lord lead me to what you want me to do Lord guide me into what you want me to do said you might not know where things are going but God always know you might not know that this is just a test to get you to where you can be blessed you might not know that this test is just to get you to where you can be blessed I said you might not know that this is just a test that God to get you to where you can be blessed see God has to sometimes work on you to give you what you asked him for I said I remember I said you know what we get this wonderful packages sometimes where there's blessing but you didn't see the trials to come with it you asked God for it and God gave it to you but you didn't see all the trials that was wrapped up in it I said you didn't see all the test that you was going to have to go through when you got that blessing am but it was something that God was contined to lift you up God was continue to say I gave you this so that you can thank me but also I want to work on you I gave you this so that you can be blessed and I can show forth that I am God but I also want to teach you a lesson I also want you to remember that even though you are blessed I'm still God and I deserve the honor and I deserve the praise and I deserve everything that I gave you and so much more I just ask that you praise me I just ask you give your life to me is that too much amen when he said I own all the cattle of thousand heels and he can give it to you all you had to do was ask amen so sometimes you don't have because you don't ask and I said God has a way to building your character that you can't even understand sometimes amen you think that but always remember in the word he said I never put more on you than you can bear but God has a way of building your character that you don't understand sometimes you know I realized something the other day something happened in my life and you know I I thought so many different things and I realized that I just found out some information that made me change my opinion on the whole situation but it took me six months to a year to find out that information and I thought about it in myself what if I had had the right Outlook from the beginning I wouldn't have spent hours and days and time trying to figure out what went wrong I want to spend hours and days and time trying to figure out what I did and how this happened and if this could have happened if that could have happened if I would have said Lord you know what I trust you and just go on from it am I could have been a whole lot further up the road in life but you don't realize how much time you sp spend it when you're going through it you don't realize when you look back over your when you look back you see they say hindsight is 220 but sometimes you got to take that time and say Lord you know what I can spend time complaining I can spend time thinking I can spend time trying to figure it out or I can just go to you and ask you and I can shortcut all that time and sometime God will tell you and sometimes he said wait and sometimes he say that ain't you don't need to worry about it cuz that's what God does because he's God and see when he has that character in you you respond in the right way when the tests and Trials come come at you you can respond in the right way see Jesus that was his main key he always responded in the right way that's how he defeated every devil because he always responded in the right way and said no matter what was coming against him he always responded in the right way now the question is do you see God is in you if he's if you want of his child and he's giving you the holy ghost that that God is he's in you he's giv you the ability to respond the right way 100% of the time not not 95 not 85 but 100% of the time because he's inside of you and God is Holy and he's perfect and that's what he requires of you cuz he said it in his word said that Lord I want your character to be built in me Lord each and every day if I got to die out like Paul said I Die daily there's a reason why Paul had to die you think about how great Paul was and how much he did and how intelligent he was and he said I count it all not I count all the things that I've accomplished to be no gain but he said but Paul was realizing that it's only by the grace of God I am where I am it's only by the grace of God and his mercy and him coming down and touching my life one day and putting his character in me that I am who I am because otherwise I seen who I was I seen what I was capable of but I also seen when God changed me he put his spirit in me I seen how different it was I seen the character that God placed in me and realizing there was nothing I could do to get that character God had to give it to me but I had to go to him and Paul had to get silent and get with God to get it Paul had to find out and be you don't want to get to the place where God had to Blind you to give you something that's what he had to do to Paul he had to Blind him and God just allowed him to have his sight back but God could have kept it he could have kept it but he didn't cuz he had a work for Paul to do he had something that he wanted Paul to do you don't want God to come down and take you down to your last to realize Lord I need to give my life to you Lord I need your character inside of me cuz Lord I want to make it Lord I want to make it in and if you don't want God to say you know what this the only way you going to make it is I got to put you all the way down so that you can make it but God will do it if you his child God will do it if you his child sometimes because he got to show you you know you might think that you're strong maybe that's your thing some people might have trials and tests and anger and this but maybe you think that you you always strong that you don't need no help that you don't need God sometimes because you I can do it I can do it but God trying to show you sometime listen I can bring you down to where you can't do it to put your put his character in you to all you can do is lift your eyes up to the heels and say Lord I need your help that's all you can do but God gives you life health and strength each and every day so that you can make that choice don't wait till you get there some people don't get the opportunity to come to their last moment to say Lord I give my life to you life is so short sometimes you got to have this character before you get there you got to have this character inside of you before you get there but the only way to get it is to get God inside of you the only way to get it is to get him inside of you and sometimes that say you dying out to everything you got to let everything go you got to get down and say Lord I I can't do this no more you got to get to that point the prophet God spoke a message on desperation you got to get desperate sometimes and life might be up and down and have so much on you but sometimes you got to go to God In Prayer by yourself you can't wait for nobody else to get get with you to pray with you you got to go to God by yourself and you got to say Lord I need something I need something to take these burdens off of me to take these weights off of me Lord and have your character so I can respond the right way Lord that I can maintain the right Integrity that I can continue to grow and continue to build on Lord the work that you're doing in my life say you want to have the right reputation and the way to have it is to have God inside of you that even when your enemies talk about you they can't say nothing but good things that's what happened when balum got on top of that mountain and he started to curse it was nothing but blessings because they had God on their side much more if you have them inside of you they just had him beside them he can be inside of you he can live that they can't say anything but good things about you because that's who God is he is nothing but good and so God God he's able to build and put that character into you that you can overcome that you can get over everything that may come against you in your life so that you can maintain the right integrity [Applause] amen and cap praise Lord am character amen you know I was thinking as brother Kell was preaching tonight it was somebody I told him a while back I was telling him I was like you know cuz sometimes people do have that attitude I don't care what they think I don't care what people say it ain't I ain't let people think what they think I says even if you ain't uh doing certain things wrong sometimes it's the way it looks the Bible says the obstain from the very appearance of evil so it ain't I don't care you ought to care how people view you amen you ought to care how people view you and when they see you brother was saying tonight you want people to say that's a Christian right there just by your life you don't have to you know I learned that early in Christian Journey you know you can Proclaim it from The Mountaintop but your life speaks louder than what you say the very life that you that you uh live right and sometimes me and my wife was saying the other night she was telling me something that she heard a a preacher say and and she said she looked at them different from that point cuz it should have never came out of their mouth and that's the truth you know sometimes we can say things that damage our whole the way people out look at you come on especially in the ministry that's why you always pray and ask God to guide your thoughts guide your mouth sometimes we speak speak real fast but you got to think about what you getting ready to say you know I was sitting there praying tonight before I came here and and I was praying on you know on myself really and I I just say Lord you know I I want to trust you in every situation am every situation in this life Lord I want to trust you it's so easy to get our minds focused on other things and we miss out on the Lord I say what is it profit a man to gain the whole world the brother Caleb said you know you get up to the gate and the Lord said I ain't going to let you in because of you know just saying it that way but and that's the truth you got to work on yourself you got to search out your own soul our eyes so fixed on everybody else and you can pray for we pray for everybody but have you looked in the mirror lately you know I I thought about something else when he was preaching T night when he was talking about looking in the mirror I remember when the Lord for before I got saved and I came home and one night I was thinking you know I'm still cool and hip cuz you know hanging out and my mama she had a way of talking to me she says cuz I was you know wasn't in my right mind at the time but she says I want you to go look at yourself in the mirror she said go I want you to go right there and look at look at just look at how you look and I went and I looked in the mirror and I bust out crying I didn't know I looked it that bad I thought I was still cool and something he had on a dirty shirt dirty jeans have hanging off you looking in bad shape but the Lord allowed me to see what I look like and I'm so glad that one day he allowed me to look in the word and see what I look like how naked wretched and miserable I was and it hum it humbled you in such a way that you know your whole life all you want to do now is just be pleasing to God everything God bless you with you think God for all the blessings but the main goal is to make Heaven my home the Rapture to make it in cuz you don't want to be down here come on so you always you press to go to extra mile extra distance you worry you wor about how people view you because you want your voice to count especially in the ministry you want your voice to count you lose that voice and then you how you going to help people and that's just not just saying in church your voice got to count on a job your voice got to count everywhere you go that people can depend on you I remember uh several times even here now uh at work people ask you to pray for them because they got confidence in you you know how much that confidence would drop if they hear me say something or or or do something you know how much of that conference they would lose so it's it's a standard that you that you got to live by come on not only is the people watching but you know the main one God Is Watching and you don't want God to take his holy spirit away from you sometimes people can say stuff or say something and it don't bother them but the moment it come out your mouth conviction Falls you know I've had that happen you know just talking randomly and I had to go get in the car and pray immediately I didn't it didn't somebody said what did you say wasen nothing bad the Holy Ghost it convicted you you didn't say that right and the one thing you you dread God Don't Take Your Presence away from me you know if God difference between you and the next man and God take his presence off of you come on the only only reason why uhuh the devil ain't having his way with you is because God's got a hedge around you that's the only that's the only reason why God is protecting you not because of the good youve done or what family you in God's got a hedge about you come on and if he was to remove that oh you the devil have his way with you come on but we thank God and that's why we always want want to walk with that and always want to keep God in our midst come on and it's like he say it's a character building process I was I was sharing I'll say this I sit down I was sharing with the church on Sunday a little um something I was hearing this this guy explained about how you know the Horseshoe how they take the the Horseshoe is one entity and the fire is another one but they take the Horseshoe for it uh perfected they take it and they put it in the fire you know and they keep beating on it and they keep beating on it they says but the longer you leave it in that fire now they're no longer the two entities I guess what he was saying but they're one you could say that now you know the fire is in the Horseshoe because the Horseshoe absorbed the fire so now they're no longer two but the fire is still there but now is in the horses shhoo and I was thinking how God does in our lives come on and I said Lord that's what I want God I want to be so you know was saying gold tried in fire but I want to be so that Lord when the people see me somebody told me once Ernest you got a a glow on your face but I want somebody when when people see you they say the fire is in there the fire is in brother Ernest the fire is in him you know I got you see no the fire is there but he's been in it so long that he's been absorbed by it ain't that what you want tonight to be in the presence of God to where he just absorbs you but it takes you allowing God you know when David asked God to search him and try him he didn't he didn't hold withhold nothing back from the Lord I don't believe but he wanted to be right search my heart try my Reigns show me where I'm wrong at God and not only will you show me where I'm wrong but give me the courage come on the courage and the faith to make it right because sometimes God will show you wrong but you don't have the courage to go back and say I was wrong to make it right to repent you don't have the courage to do that but I pray God not only show me my faults but give me the courage help me to be real and honest when I stand before you God is that what you want tonight come on I believe the true character of God can lie in that was so many things that was said tonight but if you you you got to take it come on how many has that attitude sometime I don't care what people think come on Jesus cared about everything didn't he it matters amen [Applause] amen praise God Amen
