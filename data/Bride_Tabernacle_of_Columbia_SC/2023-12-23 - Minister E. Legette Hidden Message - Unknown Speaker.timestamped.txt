[36:29] oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[36:32] thou has hid these things from the wise
[36:35] and prudent and has revealed them unto
[36:38] babes even so father for it seemed for

[36:45] are delivered to me of my father and no
[36:47] man knoweth who the son is but the
[36:50] father and who the father is but the son
[36:53] and he to whom the son will reveal him

[37:17] and6 and it reads how be it we speak
[37:20] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[37:23] not the wisdom of this world nor the
[37:25] princes of of the world this world that
[37:28] come to not but we speak the wisdom of
[37:30] God in in a mystery even the hidden
[37:33] wisdom which God have ordained before
[37:36] the before the world unto our Glory
[37:40] which none of the princes of this world
[37:42] knew for had they known it they would
[37:45] not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but
[37:48] as it is written I have not seen nor ear
[37:52] heard neither have entered into the
[37:54] heart of men the things that God
[37:57] which God hath prepared for them that
[37:59] love him but God hath revealed them to
[38:02] us by his spirit for the spirit searches
[38:05] all things yay the Deep things of God
[38:09] for what man knoweth the things of man
[38:10] say the spirit of man which is in him
[38:13] even so the things of God no man knoweth
[38:16] knoweth no man but the spirit of God now
[38:19] we haveed not the spirit of the world
[38:22] but the spirit which is of god that we
[38:25] may we might know the things that are
[38:28] freely given to us of God may God a
[38:31] blessed reading of his word just for a
[38:33] moment tonight by the grace of God I
[38:35] want to minister on a little something
[38:37] the Lord put on my heart and I entitled
[38:39] it hidden messages amen hidden messages

[38:45] over in Luke was saying you know he was
[38:48] uh calling out to the cities woe unto
[38:50] them he was saying unto them if the
[38:52] great things that's done unto you had
[38:54] been done unto Sodom and all all these
[38:56] other cities he said they would have
[38:58] repented but you see the thing you
[39:01] seeing things they haven't seen and yet
[39:02] you still won't repent he was saying W
[39:04] unto them but then he be to you know the
[39:09] disciples at that time 70 of them came
[39:11] back rejoicing because the Devils were
[39:13] subject to them but he was saying unto
[39:15] them Rejoice not because the devil's
[39:17] subject to you but Rejoice because your
[39:19] names are written in heaven and then I
[39:21] like how the Bible says he you know in
[39:23] his Spirit began to with joy began to
[39:25] rejoice in the spirit he been saying he
[39:27] was saying Lord thank you because you
[39:30] know you hid these things from the wise
[39:32] but you revealed them unto babes and you
[39:35] know so then you know we we we see that
[39:38] you know even though the mighty works
[39:40] and the things were happening you know
[39:42] in the midst of the people and it's
[39:44] always been that way you know people can
[39:46] look right at it look right at the signs
[39:49] and W look right at the scriptures being
[39:51] fulfilled look right at prophecy look
[39:53] right at it and still don't understand
[39:55] it still don't don't believe it they
[39:57] don't either don't believe it or they
[39:59] can read the Bible come to church every
[40:01] day and it happens right before them but
[40:03] they miss it when it happened but God
[40:06] reveals it to a special group of people
[40:10] and that is his select so I thank God
[40:13] today you know sometimes you know I look
[40:16] at I I said hidden messages because you
[40:18] know I was looking at some things and I
[40:20] said a hidden message is isn't is is
[40:24] when you're looking at a hidden message
[40:26] is is not what it meant to appear what
[40:29] it really is a lot of times you look at
[40:31] something and you know it appears a
[40:33] certain way but it's got you know a
[40:35] hidden a hidden message behind it it's
[40:37] got a hidden message behind it so you
[40:39] can't really see it and that's what you
[40:41] know all throughout the the ages the the
[40:44] the the the church world or the the the
[40:46] priest and stuff of that day reading the
[40:48] scriptures and all but it was veiled to
[40:50] him they reading it but you know we know
[40:53] that God he Reveals His Secrets the
[40:55] hidden things the mystery the the hidden
[40:57] things he reveals them the word come to
[40:59] the prophets he reveals the secrets to
[41:01] the servant of prophets and so the
[41:03] prophets them being able to look at the
[41:05] hidden look at the hidden things of God
[41:07] and bring them to the people but even
[41:09] though they might bring them to the
[41:10] people and preach it it's still you know
[41:14] uh people might be following the
[41:15] ministry following all that but still
[41:17] can't see it because as Paul was saying
[41:19] you know it's got to be the spirit in
[41:21] you that revealed that reveal the things
[41:23] so a lot of people can be following
[41:25] quoting even what the the prophet has
[41:28] said and all those things but yet they
[41:30] have no Revelation those those Pharisees
[41:33] and Sadducees and all even in that day
[41:35] they were quoting the scriptures Moses
[41:37] and Abraham and all these things but yet
[41:40] the the very word was manifest before
[41:42] them and they couldn't see who it was
[41:45] even John the Baptist they said are you
[41:47] the one he said no I'm just the voice of
[41:48] one crying in the wilderness now no
[41:50] doubt they was they could read the Bible
[41:53] see it and see uh the prophecy coming
[41:56] and and how uh the prophecy of the
[41:58] Forerunner to come but yet and even when
[42:00] John told him who he was they still was
[42:02] confused at who he was because in
[42:05] reading the Scriptures it was still
[42:06] hidden to them it was still veiled but
[42:10] but it took God God has to take a a a
[42:14] special group of people I say a special
[42:16] group because they're are his elect
[42:18] they're the they're his chosen group
[42:21] that out of out a a a group out of
[42:23] though many are called but few are
[42:25] chosen out of the whole group it's only
[42:27] a Chosen Few that's going to actually
[42:29] see it for what it is look be able to
[42:32] look at it and and and I I know it's
[42:34] it'd be kind of long if I try to go over
[42:36] everything but I just kind of just go
[42:39] over a little bit tonight but I said
[42:41] what it is because you know we can look
[42:44] at it from two ways you know I was
[42:46] looking at this hidden messages I I and
[42:48] I was looking at some of the simple
[42:49] things it just caught my attention where
[42:51] they was looking at or they was showing
[42:53] you certain logos you know from
[42:55] companies or certain uh things you know
[42:58] that that that they project but they
[43:01] were showing you the hidden messages
[43:03] behind those logos you know and all of
[43:06] them aren't saying like demonic but it's
[43:09] certain it's it's certain like they was
[43:11] talking about basking Robins Amazon
[43:13] pointing out just little things in their
[43:15] logo that wasn't by coincidence Apple
[43:19] but this was engineers and people like
[43:21] that that were gifted got together and
[43:24] they were able to design a certain thing
[43:26] that when you saw it it's certain things
[43:28] that was fed into your spirit without
[43:31] you even knowing things that and they
[43:34] gifted to do that they have teens that
[43:35] do these things so and then I begin to
[43:39] looking at that and I said you know that
[43:40] that's just on the on the simple scale
[43:43] so I got to really looking in into it
[43:45] more and I know we've heard it many of
[43:47] times but they were saying hidden
[43:48] messages can not only be visual but you
[43:51] know in audio and they showed how people
[43:54] uh uh devis lyrics in songs and you
[43:57] might say cu the music is good the music
[43:59] sounds good but the words make no sense
[44:02] when they sing in the the the the lyrics
[44:04] of the song they just look like they
[44:06] just throwing sentence together but it's
[44:08] the music the music is so good you
[44:10] listen to the music but the the words
[44:12] itself make no sense but a lot of it is
[44:17] hidden messages behind it they were
[44:18] saying how how it's I forget what they
[44:20] call it but you can take it and slow it
[44:23] down and play it backwards and they
[44:25] pointed several songs that this is what
[44:28] they're saying this is what they're
[44:30] saying hidden messages and what it would
[44:32] do they was saying you know by by
[44:35] um you know uh looking at it looking at
[44:38] it they could see how certain people
[44:40] would go out and there one song about
[44:42] one song it they was saying it had
[44:44] nothing to do with smoking marijuana but
[44:46] behind the hidden message was uh I feel
[44:49] good smoking marijuana or something like
[44:50] that and it it was a study that you know
[44:53] people would start smoking marijuana
[44:55] people would have things in their Spirit
[44:57] they would they didn't know but it was a
[44:59] hidden message behind it so you know I
[45:03] got to looking at and and and looking at
[45:04] this thing I said you know it it it's
[45:07] real scary it is because that that's
[45:11] just on a small scale but you might say
[45:13] oh people don't do that or they ain't it
[45:16] was just coincidence this is this is a
[45:19] coincidence they have teens and things
[45:22] that do this the people that get you to
[45:24] go out and buy stuff get you to go out
[45:25] and do stuff those are just hidden
[45:28] hidden like I call them hidden messages
[45:30] behind that and then you wonder you
[45:32] don't you don't know but you unwillingly
[45:35] the television internet all those things
[45:36] you
[45:37] unwillingly uh uh uh receiving things
[45:40] into your spirit you don't know what's
[45:42] wrong with you you don't know why you
[45:44] got certain Cravings certain desires
[45:46] spirit all throw off you can't get a
[45:47] prayer through can't get this because of
[45:49] the hidden messages because of the
[45:51] things that's back there and and and you
[45:53] know we living we're living living in a
[45:56] perverted
[45:57] World we're living in a world where the
[46:00] people that's doing these things they're
[46:02] they are
[46:03] perverted they're not saved they got
[46:05] hidden messages hidden agendas because
[46:09] of perversion in their life some they
[46:12] they create like the Bible says and the
[46:14] Bible Can't Fail that's why the Bible
[46:16] say to be they'll be maker of evil
[46:17] things creator of of evil things you
[46:20] know all that when they talk about the
[46:22] repivate mind and all because that's
[46:24] what that's what the word is going to so
[46:26] we can't get away from the scriptures
[46:28] the these you look at certain things
[46:30] people were perverted that created that
[46:32] people were perverted that came up with
[46:34] that idea oh and it looked like it might
[46:36] help Millions thousands Mass but the
[46:38] person that created it got some
[46:40] something backwards some
[46:42] perversion behind it right so I says but
[46:46] what it is it's it's and that's what the
[46:49] world we live in we'll go in we'll go
[46:51] into things follow after things run
[46:53] behind things not knowing what the what
[46:56] the foundation of it is what the
[46:58] background what what's all behind it
[47:01] that's that's the way the world is going
[47:02] today but I said you know hidden
[47:04] messages we we find that and like I said
[47:06] you you don't uh you don't want to
[47:10] believe it sometimes but I say to the
[47:12] full extent you know we'll we'll never
[47:14] know never know to the full extent of
[47:18] what to the depths that the people are
[47:21] going to the companies are going
[47:24] to the organizations we'll never know to
[47:27] the full extent of what they going to
[47:30] but it that's why I was I was praying
[47:33] last night even studying this I said
[47:35] Lord it's going to take the Holy Ghost
[47:36] in This Hour to divide between the right
[47:39] and the
[47:41] wrong like it said to be so close to
[47:43] deceive the very elect but the elect
[47:45] can't be
[47:46] deceived it's going to take I like how
[47:49] Paul was saying uh here in the um
[47:51] scriptures he was saying how be it we
[47:53] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[47:55] perfect it's going to take the Holy
[47:58] Ghost it's going to take like it says
[48:01] you you uh uh make obtaining that
[48:03] Perfection but he said we speak it among
[48:05] them the rest of the world can't see it
[48:07] the rest of the world can't understand
[48:08] because it's hidden to them this is
[48:10] hidden wisdom this is hidden wisdom they
[48:12] hearing it but they can't they have eyes
[48:14] but they can't see it they got ears but
[48:16] they can't hear it they read the same
[48:18] Bible you read come to the same uhhh
[48:21] Fellowship you come to do the same thing
[48:23] but yet they can't see it yet it's not
[48:26] reaching them they reading the same
[48:28] books but they ain't hearing the voice
[48:29] you hearing they ain't seeing the hidden
[48:32] message that you seeing you know I know
[48:35] the prophet of God I was looking at
[48:36] something he was in in desperation and
[48:38] how he was saying these things that were
[48:40] hidden he was and he talking about the
[48:42] seals and how God revealed them he says
[48:44] that that out the right now that the
[48:46] things that God has revealed that was
[48:48] hidden he said that out to throw the
[48:50] whole church world into desperation
[48:53] right
[48:53] now because it it should have showed you
[48:56] just how close we are to the coming of
[48:58] the Lord it exposed Satan and who he is
[49:02] and the plan so that should have throw
[49:04] the whole church World in desperation
[49:06] everybody should have been on their
[49:07] knees wanting to get closer to God he
[49:10] said but it didn't reason why it didn't
[49:12] because even though it was revealed and
[49:14] people say oh the Seal's been revealed
[49:15] and all those things but yet it's still
[49:17] hidden to them why because by
[49:19] intellectual knowledge you can never
[49:21] understand it it takes like he says no
[49:24] man ain't going to know it but except
[49:25] for the spirit the spirit got Jesus said
[49:28] nobody no man ain't know the father but
[49:30] the son no man don't know he said but
[49:32] who the son reveal unto him so even
[49:35] though you had all those walking around
[49:37] Jesus and they didn't know who he was
[49:40] still doubting still you know all this
[49:42] things because if they did they would
[49:43] have never sh him but just like here in
[49:45] the scriptures he said had they known
[49:47] they wouldn't have crucified him he
[49:49] worked all the Miracles they saw the it
[49:51] was Dove tell together scriptures coming
[49:54] but they couldn't see it because it was
[49:56] hidden it was hidden from them you know
[49:59] but I thank God today just as it was
[50:01] then it was it's always been that way
[50:04] you look at throughout all the
[50:06] scriptures it's always been that way God
[50:09] sends a word sends a opens the the
[50:13] scriptures and reveal the word for your
[50:15] day and a lot of the people rally around
[50:17] it come out but yet they don't see they
[50:21] they perish they still stumble they
[50:22] still why they rallied behind sometimes
[50:26] the signs and the Wonders they rall
[50:27] behind the good time they rall behind
[50:30] you know uh uh just something something
[50:32] new but really getting down to it I and
[50:35] I get all over myself I says you know
[50:38] today I said it's hard it's hard today
[50:41] to to find to find the people you know
[50:45] uh that really really want to really
[50:48] want to want to know what God has for
[50:51] want them to do really want to know what
[50:53] their purpose is and in in the kingdom
[50:56] of God is a lot of times you know you
[50:59] get saved people get saved and all they
[51:01] happy they're rejoicing the Lord saved
[51:03] them brought them out of a bad condition
[51:05] or whatever condition they in and they
[51:07] worshiping the Lord But as time go on
[51:10] things get easy look like the devil let
[51:11] up then they it's like they just go
[51:13] through the motion you just go through
[51:15] the motion then come to church you know
[51:18] day in day out you just going through
[51:19] the motion but really to have a burden
[51:22] in your heart to to find out what the
[51:25] purpose that God saved you for to find
[51:27] out Lord what what am I what what part
[51:30] am I to play in the kingdom of God you
[51:33] know we are we are a house we're we're
[51:35] the house of God and fitly framed
[51:38] together God is God has fitly framed us
[51:40] together to make up the house of God you
[51:43] got a you when you saying fitly frame
[51:45] every block ain't the same you got a
[51:47] part you got to play God didn't just
[51:50] save you for not but you got a position
[51:52] God saved you for something so I says
[51:56] Lord where where are the people that
[51:59] that's really looking not just to say
[52:01] going to church not just because of our
[52:03] Duty or or just to goal just per form of
[52:06] fashion but the the people that really
[52:09] look and say God like Paul says what
[52:12] will you have me to do Lord what part do
[52:15] you want me to play Not only that God
[52:17] where where do you want me to be at a
[52:19] lot of times you say like you say that
[52:21] you know I don't I don't know about you
[52:23] but I want to know where where are we in
[52:25] time I want to know you know uh oh where
[52:29] are where are we where where what what's
[52:32] next Lord what what is what what am I to
[52:33] be under expectation for we know that we
[52:35] say we know that course scripture and
[52:36] all the things but I want to say Lord
[52:38] the Lord has got to reveal to you it'll
[52:40] cause your life to
[52:42] change it'll cause your walk to change
[52:45] it'll cause your your appetite your
[52:47] daily it'll cause everything to change
[52:50] because you want to find your place you
[52:52] want to find your place your place your
[52:54] position
[52:55] and that's for every individual not just
[52:58] in the ministry but every individual God
[53:00] saved you for a purpose you want to find
[53:02] out what that purpose is but I says you
[53:04] know we find that a lot of times and
[53:06] like I says you know we when we talking
[53:08] about those hidden when we talking about
[53:10] those hidden messages it could go both
[53:12] ways we're looking at how you know uh uh
[53:15] in the word like I said people reading
[53:18] read the word but in inside of the word
[53:20] is some things hidden in there that God
[53:22] want to reveal to you that you are are
[53:25] not just you're not just like like was
[53:27] reading the other day you're not like
[53:29] them you're not just an ordinary group
[53:31] but you are the bride of Christ you are
[53:33] called
[53:34] out God has called you
[53:37] out come on to take the Rapture God has
[53:40] called you out to be the difference may
[53:42] God has called you out as the elect and
[53:45] so you got to you can't be like them you
[53:47] got a part you got to play you got a
[53:50] position that God has called you to but
[53:53] how many are really seeking that how
[53:55] many are really looking you know and
[53:57] really praying for what the will of God
[54:00] is for their life you know I certain
[54:03] things dawned on me when I was uh
[54:05] looking at but I says really praying
[54:07] because the devil can get you all throw
[54:09] off but really praying for what the will
[54:12] of God is for your life and what because
[54:15] you said Lord things are happening so
[54:17] fast things are moving moving so fast
[54:20] god I want to be in your will what is
[54:22] your will where do you want me at what
[54:23] do you want me doing what what my role
[54:25] God where do you want me that's where I
[54:27] want to be at what's next what am I
[54:29] looking for come on but many of people
[54:32] as as I like I said this it would be
[54:34] kind of long to try to go over over it
[54:36] all but many many people don't look for
[54:38] prophecy they just look for good sermons
[54:40] good jump shout God going to bless you
[54:43] but
[54:44] prophecy prophecy being fulfilled
[54:46] prophecy of your day prophecy they don't
[54:48] look for that a lot of times they just
[54:51] want to just but you know it it's times
[54:54] you know I can see them going all those
[54:56] years you know and and the lamp of God
[54:59] went out but then all of a sudden Samuel
[55:02] came God spoke I mean God spoke to
[55:04] Samuel didn't he all right now it's no
[55:06] time we're just going in and out things
[55:09] about to change word is being fulfill
[55:11] now I come to open the book all through
[55:14] the scriptures you find that so it say
[55:16] okay you know the Prophet come he come
[55:18] and he gone now we're going on and on
[55:21] but it's still a happening what are you
[55:23] looking for what are you waiting what is
[55:25] a sign what are you what are you seeking
[55:27] after Hallelujah but I I begin looking
[55:30] at that I say but what it is people say
[55:32] we thought it was going to come but it
[55:35] but you know you missed it it was right
[55:37] there among you right there saw it but
[55:39] you couldn't see it why because it was a
[55:40] hit it was hidden to you Hallelujah but
[55:44] when when the word is revealed to you
[55:46] when God in your spirit begins to do
[55:48] something the Bible becomes a new book
[55:51] you can't you can't stay away from the
[55:53] word because it's something in there
[55:55] that draws you to it life is in it you
[55:58] can read the word and just be
[55:59] intellectual and don't do you no good
[56:02] but when when the Holy Ghost will begin
[56:04] to reveal things to
[56:06] you of of where you are in time you just
[56:10] start I was sharing with Charlotte last
[56:12] night I was saying you know sometimes
[56:14] you know you could do a lot of study
[56:16] study studying but that ain't nothing
[56:18] like the Holy Ghost just dropping things
[56:20] on
[56:21] you I says you can't explain that
[56:25] that's what I was sharing with Charlotte
[56:27] last night you can't explain you can do
[56:30] a lot of study study studying and people
[56:32] can show you how much they study cuz
[56:34] they can you know however they do it but
[56:37] I says it's nothing more precious than
[56:39] you can be walking along and it happens
[56:42] all the time or just going about your
[56:44] daily and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost
[56:47] just drops things in your spirit and
[56:49] scriptures start coming together and
[56:51] then you take that and you begin to
[56:54] write it down sometimes or you stop what
[56:56] you're doing and begin searching the
[56:57] scriptures and it be just as what the
[57:00] Holy Ghost revealed to you then you take
[57:02] it you know and see what see what the
[57:04] prophet of God was saying about it but
[57:05] what it and then all of it seems to come
[57:08] together but it's nothing more that
[57:11] that's what I says that I was sharing
[57:13] with Charlotte last night for a while
[57:15] talking to her I said that's the that's
[57:17] the thing that we love that God because
[57:20] why God do does certain things and it's
[57:22] not out of season God is always in
[57:24] season
[57:26] he's he's not out of season he's always
[57:29] when when when the Holy Ghost is
[57:30] revealing something or or saying
[57:32] something he's always in
[57:34] season why because he already knows
[57:37] what's going to happen tomorrow he
[57:39] already knows what's coming up the road
[57:40] so he begins putting things your spirit
[57:42] revealing things to you or you might be
[57:44] about to make a decision and the Holy
[57:46] Ghost comes by and he drops things in
[57:49] your spirit and tells you to stay away
[57:50] from it leave it alone you might not
[57:53] understand why but what it is you you
[57:56] you
[57:57] learn uh how how to be in tune with God
[58:01] you learn the voice of God you learn
[58:03] when God is speaking to you and you
[58:06] learn to obey it too you from at one
[58:08] point of time early in your Christian
[58:10] Journey you might have didn't always
[58:11] obey it but you learned how to obey it
[58:13] you learned to obey
[58:16] it because of the things you suffered
[58:18] for not obeying it sometimes but you
[58:22] count it as a blessing that's what I
[58:24] don't know I said that's what I look for
[58:27] you know it's been many of times but I
[58:28] says you know it it's it's hidden like
[58:31] was saying hidden message out I can't go
[58:32] over scripture scripture like I want to

[1:00:54] trash he's sitting there holding he says
[1:00:56] I don't feel no different he said I
[1:00:59] don't I don't and I said yeah I said see
[1:01:01] I be talked to him a little bit I said
[1:01:04] see everybody thinking these people
[1:01:05] didn't just create these things or just
[1:01:08] imagine these things right I said these
[1:01:11] creatures and all I said but one day I
[1:01:15] hope you be on the other side but one
[1:01:17] day you going to find out these things
[1:01:19] weren fairy
[1:01:22] tale one day you gonna find out I was
[1:01:24] telling them at work they ain't
[1:01:26] imagining I said you think these people
[1:01:28] just go on these these these Hollywood
[1:01:29] people just imagining these people demon
[1:01:32] possessed they seeing things in reals
[1:01:35] and they bringing them back to us and
[1:01:37] showing you what they seeing over there
[1:01:39] everybody laugh Earnest I know you don't
[1:01:42] believe that I said one day you'll see
[1:01:45] it one day you'll understand that that
[1:01:47] it ain't it ain't no joke right so we
[1:01:51] had a couple of the The Other Guys in
[1:01:53] there they were was with me on it but
[1:01:55] that's that's probably cuz they've been
[1:01:56] raised by their
[1:01:58] grandma or somewhere down in in you know
[1:02:01] somewhere in the South put it that
[1:02:03] way and they believe in those spirits
[1:02:06] and stuff that but I says that what it
[1:02:09] is what was the purpose of of of whoever
[1:02:12] created this vest for you to wear a
[1:02:15] safety vest to put that emblem on
[1:02:19] there you say what what's the purpose of
[1:02:23] that being the logo of your
[1:02:26] company come on and that's just a safety
[1:02:29] vest imagine all the clothes we wear the
[1:02:32] certain things you know he says but what
[1:02:34] it is that's just on and I said that's
[1:02:36] just the tip of it that's just a tip I
[1:02:40] said God it's going to take the Holy
[1:02:42] Ghost exposing things revealing things
[1:02:44] to us unwillingly things get in your
[1:02:47] spirit unwillingly things happen but God
[1:02:51] got to do something in our lives but
[1:02:53] just as
[1:02:55] the world is using that in in in that
[1:02:57] realm they using that but God you look
[1:03:00] at his word even the spiritual people
[1:03:02] they can't see it why because it's
[1:03:03] hidden to them ain't it but and it takes
[1:03:07] a a a gifted person it takes an elected
[1:03:10] person it takes a Spirit-filled man to
[1:03:12] be able to look and see what the hidden
[1:03:14] message is and I thank God today that
[1:03:18] that you and I he has chosen us not by
[1:03:21] our our own choosing but God has chosen
[1:03:24] us
[1:03:25] like Paul was saying before the
[1:03:26] foundation of the world before the world
[1:03:29] God chose us in him I'm glad that God
[1:03:31] did that and I'm glad that he desired
[1:03:34] like he says to hide it from the wise
[1:03:36] and reveal it to the bab such as would
[1:03:38] learn I'm he thank God for that because
[1:03:40] he said no man ain't going to know
[1:03:41] itless L the father L I let the son
[1:03:44] reveal him no man ain't going to know it
[1:03:46] God got to reveal it God got to do these
[1:03:47] things why because they hidden God got
[1:03:50] to do these things it's more than just
[1:03:52] coming to church it's more than just
[1:03:53] singing It's more than just getting
[1:03:55] happy and just oh God saved me I got a
[1:03:57] great testimony he brought me from a
[1:03:59] mighty long way he did but it's more
[1:04:01] than that it's going on to
[1:04:04] Perfection it's it's I I was preaching
[1:04:06] here the last several weeks I've been
[1:04:08] saying and I said many people going to
[1:04:11] die and not make it with a powerful
[1:04:14] testimony you don't think the children
[1:04:16] of Israel they had a real powerful
[1:04:18] testimony didn't they how God brought
[1:04:20] them
[1:04:21] out out of Egypt through the Red Sea and
[1:04:26] all that but they didn't make it over
[1:04:28] they didn't cross over did they they
[1:04:30] died in the wilderness because of
[1:04:32] unbelief they made it out but they
[1:04:34] didn't never go
[1:04:36] in and they we've been given that
[1:04:38] warning today right God has called you
[1:04:42] come out of her whether it's come out of

[1:09:30] hidden messages come on it's on both
[1:09:32] sides I believe that
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:42] amen praise the Lord
[1:09:44] amen I was just looking back and seeing
[1:09:48] most of the mom and
[1:09:50] pop
[1:09:52] bookstores sold out to the big book
[1:09:56] stores because they had all the
[1:09:58] information and exposing what was going
[1:10:01] on thought about the little book let
[1:10:04] brother Ernest whole termo in the toy
[1:10:08] box and I guess you can't find it
[1:10:11] nowhere you been able to find
[1:10:14] it he said I'll bring it right
[1:10:18] back is those little
[1:10:21] messages the people used to come on the
[1:10:23] radio and and so forth and they used to
[1:10:26] teach about what's going on with the
[1:10:28] young
[1:10:30] people and um about the
[1:10:33] songs with the Beatles and all and they
[1:10:35] showed you that you can play it
[1:10:37] backwards and see how to be worship and
[1:10:39] Satan and calling on Satan and all of
[1:10:42] that and different ones they used to
[1:10:44] show all of that and show you how to
[1:10:46] check this out the the little
[1:10:49] advertisement on television to show all
[1:10:51] of that expose all of that stuff you
[1:10:53] don't hear those voices no
[1:10:55] more Jimmy schwier used to come on and
[1:10:58] preach about Mr Babylon and you know who
[1:11:01] it was Revelation 17 and all you don't
[1:11:04] hear that no more you see I'm going tell
[1:11:09] you something once you start exposing
[1:11:11] the
[1:11:12] devil you know I I had a
[1:11:17] uh what you call it one of those
[1:11:21] DVDs that uh let Brothers brother Jer
[1:11:24] saw it on on the Messi Mason showed how
[1:11:28] it was
[1:11:30] Witchcraft and the luciferian doctrine
[1:11:33] and and so forth you can't see that no
[1:11:36] more you start talking that kind of talk
[1:11:38] you're in trouble you know what I'm
[1:11:40] saying so to
[1:11:42] expose Lucifer and expose the devil in
[1:11:45] all those areas you you people almost
[1:11:49] you can't you start doing that you're in
[1:11:51] trouble are you with me
[1:11:54] so people a lot of times young people
[1:11:56] are in sorties and in these things they
[1:11:59] drawn up with that's why they call them
[1:12:01] the dogs
[1:12:04] and different things like that Q dog and
[1:12:08] this and that so they they they get into
[1:12:12] demon worship without even knowing they
[1:12:15] into that demon worship they get in you
[1:12:18] know what do you desire light the light
[1:12:20] that they talking about is
[1:12:21] Lucifer you know what I'm saying
[1:12:24] so a lot of things people get into they
[1:12:27] don't know that they're involved into
[1:12:30] they way up the road in it and locked in
[1:12:32] it till they become deceived in it and
[1:12:36] they think that they're doing because
[1:12:37] you can do good things you know we can
[1:12:40] do we can do some nice things like you
[1:12:43] know things that in the community things
[1:12:46] that would make society and life better
[1:12:49] but at the same time people don't know
[1:12:52] it's contr control Power things that
[1:12:55] control you things that bring you into
[1:12:58] subjection so by the grace of God we
[1:13:01] thank
[1:13:01] God now when they saw Jesus they called
[1:13:05] Jesus what Bible because even though he
[1:13:09] had the right spirit and he was actually
[1:13:12] delivering people but all the church
[1:13:15] world came against him because they say
[1:13:18] he was bezug because he was really
[1:13:21] exposing the deception
[1:13:24] I I believe there were good people
[1:13:26] people that mean the right thing and
[1:13:28] tried to do the right thing but at the
[1:13:30] same time Jesus came on the side on the
[1:13:34] on the scene they didn't want to believe
[1:13:36] that amen this Pharisee religion and
[1:13:39] this SED religion and all of these
[1:13:42] herodians and stuff like that they
[1:13:44] didn't want to believe that
[1:13:46] hey we're right we know we're right my
[1:13:49] father talking about my great granddaddy
[1:13:51] my granddaddy you know so
[1:13:53] actually they thought they were talking
[1:13:55] about the God that they were serving in
[1:13:57] the Bible that they had they thought
[1:13:59] that that's what uh Jesus was coming
[1:14:02] against them but he's actually coming
[1:14:04] against them because they do error not
[1:14:06] knowing the scripture though they read
[1:14:08] it though they believe supposed to
[1:14:11] believe it and I'm I'm saying they
[1:14:14] believed it but they were twisted and
[1:14:16] believ in it amen uh with a little twist
[1:14:20] to it and that's all the devil amen
[1:14:23] uh the the eve might have beli what God
[1:14:26] Said but Satan just Twisted a little bit
[1:14:29] nowed you should not die and that's all
[1:14:32] the devil has to do is just twist the
[1:14:33] word a little bit amen and people get
[1:14:36] just go on and the devil knows he got
[1:14:39] you if he can get you to dot one word
[1:14:41] that God said there one thing in the
[1:14:44] Bible the devil can twist you up with
[1:14:47] that's all he got to to keep you out of
[1:14:50] the Kingdom to keep you out of Heaven
[1:14:52] all he got to do is Twist you you up in
[1:14:53] one area so man should not live by bread
[1:14:57] alone but by every word we said the
[1:15:00] elect cannot be deceived why
[1:15:05] amen praise
[1:15:07] God said Adam was not deceived but the
[1:15:10] woman being deceived was in the
[1:15:11] transgression isin't that right praise
[1:15:14] God you got to be in this the second
[1:15:17] atam last Adam you got to be in Jesus
[1:15:20] Christ in order not to be deceived the
[1:15:22] only way you won't be deceived you you
[1:15:25] amen you got to be in
[1:15:28] Christ praise God and he is the
[1:15:31] word are you with me so thank God for
[1:15:35] the word tonight praise God sometimes
[1:15:39] these sublim
[1:15:42] messages that's why you got to be
[1:15:44] careful how you hear and what you
[1:15:46] hear because those things are injected
[1:15:49] in your
[1:15:51] spirit we ought to feed on the word we
[1:15:53] ought to want that more than
[1:15:56] anything see because sometimes those
[1:15:59] things begin to come into our spirit man
[1:16:02] unconsciously
[1:16:04] unaware as he said certain men crept in
[1:16:07] unaware certain Spirits amen deceiving
[1:16:11] deceptic Spirits can get hold to
[1:16:16] you and you what without you even
[1:16:19] knowing that these Spirits are
[1:16:22] controlling your life
[1:16:24] demons out of the pits of hell they just
[1:16:27] wiggled themselves in and made you
[1:16:30] believe a
[1:16:32] lie and think it was the truth but they
[1:16:36] just wiggled themselves in
[1:16:38] unaware
[1:16:40] why it's because we didn't surrender all
[1:16:43] to God we didn't say God I want all I
[1:16:47] God I I want everything on your word
[1:16:51] Lord I want every I want to live right
[1:16:53] right I want to do right I want to I I I
[1:16:55] want to please you

[1:17:00] of people don't come to that point that
[1:17:03] they want to go all the way 100% with
[1:17:05] God see sometime you know I was looking

[1:17:24] this it's just by the grace of God I am
[1:17:26] what I am but people living a kind of
[1:17:30] crooked lives scheming for money and
[1:17:33] position and power and they're
[1:17:36] scheming and yet they're going to stand
[1:17:38] up before God and they GNA have to stand
[1:17:40] before God say I scheme I wanted to be a
[1:17:43] pastor because I want money I wanted to
[1:17:45] do this because I want wanted to be big

[1:20:42] sometimes you can stand and don't even
[1:20:44] open your
[1:20:45] mouth amen you ain't got to say nothing
[1:20:48] just folks feel condemned in your
[1:20:51] presence why because they know you're
[1:20:53] not of The Same
[1:20:56] Spirit some folk will a pat you on the
[1:20:59] back and tell you you all right just to

[1:21:29] look at others amen you got to stand
[1:21:31] before God they got to stand before God
[1:21:35] I don't know why I'm saying these things
[1:21:37] but it's really been in my spirit
[1:21:39] because
[1:21:41] sometimes there's spirits that come in
[1:21:44] and he said in the
[1:21:46] sublim Hidden Spirits they come in and
[1:21:50] they manipulate maneuver and people are
[1:21:53] actually subjected to spirits that they
[1:21:56] say

[1:22:00] find yourself got to compromise and got
[1:22:05] to make yourself feel like yeah it's all

[1:22:35] the the Lord spares this is the year of
[1:22:40] that God would expose
[1:22:44] spirits and this is the
[1:22:47] year that the hammer is going to

[1:25:51] I can start showing
[1:25:53] y'all
[1:25:57] what and they said the children way back
[1:26:00] when we studyed back in the early 80s
[1:26:02] and in the 70s the children because of
[1:26:05] the computers and the games they were
[1:26:08] having
[1:26:09] seizures and in the different countries
[1:26:12] that I was in children was getting
[1:26:14] seizures so they ban different games
[1:26:17] because those games were giving the
[1:26:19] children
[1:26:21] seizures
[1:26:25] could your children get a hold of some
[1:26:26] of these games and stuff they give they
[1:26:29] they baned them over in China over in
[1:26:31] different countries a lot of those gam I
[1:26:34] had all of that information I had all of
[1:26:36] that stuff we should we should teach on
[1:26:38] that stuff and try to make the parents
[1:26:40] conscious and aware now everybody got
[1:26:43] all kind of
[1:26:46] games and so when the sicknesses and
[1:26:48] stuff the children start acting strange
[1:26:51] it's because of you know they it's demon
[1:26:55] powers these people are inspired to do
[1:26:58] these
[1:27:00] things and we I wish I had those those
[1:27:03] sisters that come out of Witchcraft they
