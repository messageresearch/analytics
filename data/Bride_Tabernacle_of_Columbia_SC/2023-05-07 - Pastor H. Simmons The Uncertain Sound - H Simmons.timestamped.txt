[41:42] word of Prayer
[41:44] I will lift my eyes into the heels
[41:48] for which cometh my help
[41:50] for my help coming from the Lord
[41:53] made the heavens and the Earth
[41:56] surely God
[41:58] would not suffer our foot to be moved
[42:02] dotted keeping the Israel shall need to
[42:04] Slumber not sleep
[42:07] the Lord is our help
[42:10] father we look to you now
[42:13] Lord there are many needs Lord and
[42:16] we know that use promise in your word
[42:18] but my God shall supply all of your
[42:21] needs
[42:22] according to your riches in glory
[42:25] so far that we look now to you Lord
[42:28] may you bless your word may you bless
[42:30] your people
[42:32] may you continue to bless your service
[42:34] Lord we thank you for the service that's
[42:36] for
[42:38] God as we look to you in Jesus Christ's
[42:41] name amen
[42:44] the book of
[42:46] First Corinthians 14.
[42:54] you know it's a wonderful thing to be
[42:56] saved
[43:00] many people
[43:03] may have a desire to be saved and may
[43:06] want to be saved but they find struggles
[43:08] and battles
[43:09] they go through very difficult times
[43:12] that
[43:13] not in their hearts they want to be
[43:15] saved and they want to be a Christian
[43:17] they want to live for God
[43:20] but yet there's a struggle
[43:23] and that it was struggled and end with
[43:25] battle
[43:27] just to release and give up and give God
[43:32] they find
[43:36] the inability
[43:37] they can't seem to
[43:40] make up their minds whether they want to
[43:42] let go and give God their all
[43:45] but I trust this morning that
[43:48] that would be a certainty inside of you
[43:51] that you want God to have all of you
[43:54] and you want to give them your all
[43:58] First Corinthians 14 and 1 it says
[44:01] fall after charity and desired spiritual
[44:04] gifts but rather that ye may prophesize
[44:07] for he that speaketh in an unknown
[44:09] tongue speaking not unto men but unto
[44:12] God for no man understands him I did in
[44:16] spirit he speaks mystery but he just
[44:19] prophesied speaketh unto men to
[44:22] edification and exaltation and comfort
[44:26] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[44:29] edifies himself but he that prophesy
[44:32] identifies the church
[44:34] a word that you all speak with tongues
[44:37] but rather that ye prophesies for
[44:40] greater is he that prophesied then he
[44:44] that speaketh with tongues except he
[44:47] interprets that the church may be
[44:51] receive edifying now Brethren if I come
[44:56] unto you
[44:57] speaking with tongues what shall I
[45:01] profit you except I shall speak to you
[45:05] either by Revelation or by knowledge or
[45:09] by prophecy saying or by Doctrine
[45:13] and
[45:15] even things without life given sound
[45:20] eat whether pipe or heart except they
[45:24] give a distinction in the sound how
[45:28] shall it be known what is pipe or heart
[45:34] for if the trumpet gives an uncertain
[45:37] sound who should prepare himself to
[45:40] battle
[45:40] may God bless the reason's words you may
[45:42] be seen you
[45:47] want to talk this morning about the
[45:49] uncertain sound
[45:51] said if this trumpet gives an uncertain
[45:54] sound
[45:56] who should prepare themselves for battle
[46:00] you know I was
[46:03] just in prayer yesterday and I've
[46:05] started writing down some things about
[46:07] me
[46:08] you know it's it's a possibility that
[46:12] and I know that sometimes we need
[46:17] to be in tune with God
[46:21] and as I was thinking about being in
[46:23] tune and thought about the musical
[46:26] aspect of
[46:28] tune it and then thought it was a
[46:32] difference between to be in tune and
[46:36] and I thought about tone
[46:39] you know the tone that we're in
[46:43] sometimes when
[46:46] a tone setting it says it's the tone in
[46:52] which we speak in could be
[46:55] um harsh could be loud or I could be
[46:58] soothing
[47:00] he said a tone is sound especially as
[47:05] one is Pleasant uh Musical one that of a
[47:12] serious or such
[47:14] sound of Rage
[47:17] so we can have different tones then I
[47:20] thought about tune
[47:22] a lot of people don't know
[47:25] whether they're into an auto tune
[47:28] because
[47:29] sometimes people saying people are tone
[47:31] deaf
[47:33] you know they don't know
[47:37] um
[47:39] some people when they listen and I've
[47:42] seen the musicians work with voices
[47:44] and sometimes seeing musicians who work
[47:46] with voices I find they try to get The
[47:49] Sopranos to sing soprano and they sing
[47:52] at Otto
[47:53] they're trying to get the hassles to
[47:56] sing out to when they're singing soprano
[47:59] and sometimes you know
[48:01] musicians get together and
[48:04] you know they wanted drums to
[48:06] be in time
[48:09] and they want um the mute the organ and
[48:12] the musician all of them to be in time
[48:14] and to work together
[48:16] and um sometimes if
[48:18] one has a better ear to hear
[48:23] and then the other have
[48:26] a sort of a hearing impairment
[48:29] and they came here as well
[48:31] so they have to lean on the one next to
[48:35] them who can hear
[48:37] better
[48:38] and so that one that can't hear too good
[48:41] so when the Rhythm changed
[48:44] and they need to stay in key you know
[48:47] stay in tune and now a particular place
[48:50] if they're singing soprano they need to
[48:53] stay in that soprano place
[48:56] and if the one that can't quite handle
[49:00] their position so they listen to that
[49:02] one that's more gifted and they just
[49:04] need to die
[49:06] and I you know I see them in practice
[49:08] and then trying to you know get it
[49:11] together amen so it's a lot of things
[49:14] that people work on you know some people
[49:17] they you know they everybody believes
[49:19] that everybody can be the tambourine
[49:22] just give them one
[49:23] two years old one year old and they're
[49:25] still in the crib
[49:29] it sound good a bunch of noise don't it
[49:32] but it doesn't matter because you know I
[49:34] can just put one in your hand you're
[49:36] supposed to be able to do it
[49:38] but
[49:40] I don't care how chaotic it sounds
[49:42] to a person like me
[49:45] you know he said hey I don't know
[49:48] God I I can't hear that well so I don't
[49:51] know where you're into it or not but
[49:54] somebody that's very sensitive to Tunes
[49:57] they can say hey it's a lot of noise
[50:01] we're walking and not me
[50:04] I can't hear it sounds like you know
[50:07] that's because I can't distinguish
[50:11] so
[50:12] I I want us to understand
[50:15] after Trump who gives an uncertain sound
[50:18] who can prepare himself for battle
[50:22] it's very we can become very sensitive
[50:25] spiritually
[50:27] sensitive in the spirit
[50:29] and when your sensitive spiritually wise
[50:32] some people are insensitive to the
[50:35] spirit to happen and they'll tune into
[50:37] the world and what the world you know
[50:40] was going on and they have a worldly
[50:43] Spirit they'll tune into a worldly
[50:46] spirit and they don't even know it
[50:47] they're unconscious of that I could
[50:50] cater more to something that would be
[50:53] worldly of fleshly uh all about the
[50:57] flesh than all about God
[51:00] you know sometimes the church want to
[51:03] get in the spirit of the world sometimes
[51:05] people because of because of not uh
[51:09] having a sincere prayer life and not
[51:13] being a consecrated to God then you just
[51:17] don't you just don't be spiritual
[51:19] because you come to church
[51:21] you don't just be spiritual because you
[51:25] know I I'm spiritual you know but it
[51:29] takes consecration it takes dedication
[51:31] to God for God to for you to be in tune
[51:35] with God
[51:36] is very possible the possibility of you
[51:41] not living a consecrated life and
[51:44] thinking that what we're doing hey you
[51:48] know this is all about God it's it can't
[51:51] be about God when you're not taking that
[51:54] time to spend time with God and
[51:57] consecrate in your life
[51:59] and dedicating yourself and spending
[52:01] time when you communing with God if
[52:04] you're not in income communion with God
[52:08] then you don't understand just like the
[52:10] musicians they they take time and they
[52:13] practice and they listen and they see
[52:16] how they sound and they see whether or
[52:19] not I'm sounding whether or not I'm
[52:21] keeping time so they get a tuna
[52:23] you know uh a minister used to work with
[52:27] me he should tune pianos way before they
[52:30] got all this electronic stuff and these
[52:33] gadgets and he would take a little
[52:35] hammering the thing and he was King see
[52:39] what this ends see you know what this is
[52:41] you know
[52:43] a or whatever and he's a thing he
[52:46] listens
[52:48] and I said okay he's tuning but to me
[52:53] CEO a or whatever all of them the same
[52:56] to me because I don't know what he's
[52:58] doing
[52:59] and that's the same thing
[53:01] what man knows the things of man saved
[53:05] the spirit on demand
[53:07] see we have to have the spirit of the
[53:09] Lord to know whether we are in tune with
[53:12] the Lord without the spirit of the lord
[53:14] we cannot please God
[53:16] without the spirit of the lord we are
[53:19] actually out of tune with the spiritual
[53:22] things of God because who has known the
[53:24] mind of God you can't know the mind of
[53:27] God except you have the spirit of God
[53:29] and you know you can't understand the
[53:32] things of God you have to have a spirit
[53:35] see because without his Spirit you'll
[53:39] just presuming that you know God and you
[53:42] know what what what is you know what
[53:44] church is and you know how church goes
[53:47] but do you know what God is requiring of
[53:51] you spiritually because God can communes
[53:54] with you daily to bring you up into
[53:57] things that you need to perfect in your
[54:01] life things that you need to work on to
[54:04] make you more in tune with God and bring
[54:07] your life in order you know what I'm
[54:10] saying so you need an order
[54:13] you need to order your life but it
[54:16] doesn't matter because you know if we
[54:18] take God lightly and we don't care about
[54:21] you know being in tune we don't we just
[54:24] do because hey this is what we do and
[54:28] this is what you know we're not really
[54:30] into
[54:31] but you know you take uh an orchestra's
[54:36] teacher you know she comes and you know
[54:39] she knows you know my niece she she
[54:42] worked with Orchestra so she knows hey
[54:45] that violin you just wait a minute y'all
[54:49] this section your violins you all need
[54:51] to do this over here
[54:52] do it again
[54:54] y'all ain't got it you know what I'm
[54:57] saying and they'll keep going but that's
[54:59] what the Holy Ghost does it makes us in
[55:02] tune with God the Holy Ghost will let
[55:04] you know when you're out of tune with
[55:07] God it'll begin to say hey hey hey come
[55:11] on come on you know you're in church you
[55:13] you're going through the motion but are
[55:16] you into no no no no it's trying to tune
[55:18] you up the Holy Ghost began to speak to
[55:21] you and try to get you you know in tune
[55:23] to God where you can amen where you can
[55:26] flow in the spirit
[55:28] see God wants you to be able to flow in
[55:32] the spirit where where you're not trying
[55:33] to work it up and you're trying to make
[55:36] it up but you're flowing amen everything
[55:39] is in harmony
[55:42] you want the the church to be in harmony
[55:46] amen we want to you know that we don't
[55:49] want the trumpet to give uncertain want
[55:51] to be in harmony with with the Holy
[55:53] Spirit when we are in harmony with the
[55:56] Holy Spirit then there's a flow amen
[56:00] there's a pleasant Spirit that's a sweet
[56:03] spirit amen that goes along with you in
[56:06] tune with God it's so sweet it's not
[56:09] about I'm trying to reflect even my
[56:12] voice I'm not trying to show you my
[56:15] talent I'm not trying
[56:17] we got to we got to be in tune in
[56:20] Harmony One with another amen and when
[56:23] we're not in harmony with God we may be
[56:26] in harmony with the Devil
[56:29] you know what I'm saying we may be more
[56:31] in harmony with the devil because amen
[56:35] and nobody gonna tell me how you know I
[56:39] I can see the the the the awkwardness
[56:43] teaching this one on Earth you know I
[56:45] want to do my solo but this ain't solo
[56:48] time if you can read the music you'll
[56:51] know amen that it's not solo time right
[56:54] now are you with me we are all playing
[56:58] here in harmony together but you know
[57:02] some folks that can't read the music
[57:04] that you know that you know they don't
[57:07] mind because I can play
[57:10] so it doesn't matter whether I'm in tune
[57:13] with y'all Or Not amen so the church is
[57:17] you know one body and one spirit and
[57:20] everybody got to be in harmony
[57:22] harmonizing together and when it's
[57:24] harmonizing together it goes up as a
[57:27] sweet smell before God
[57:29] and God can hear amen he can hear your
[57:32] spirit on everybody experienced uh in
[57:36] harmony you see I'm not talking about so
[57:38] much and So you you're being in harmony
[57:40] with brother Simmons or with Brian
[57:42] Tabernacle but I'm talking about being
[57:44] in harmony with God
[57:47] even being tuned in with God and you
[57:50] know everything else to take care itself
[57:53] amen we don't have to teach on how to
[57:56] dress and how to live and all of that
[57:58] because when you're in tune with God
[57:59] Amen the Holy Spirit gonna teach you all
[58:03] of that isn't that right amen but when
[58:06] you're out of tune with God Amen folks
[58:09] come by and say hey you need to do this
[58:10] you need to do that that dress is too
[58:12] tight those shoes are too hot you know
[58:15] what we doing
[58:17] it it becomes a law like somebody's
[58:21] beating you up somebody trying to make
[58:22] you do something you don't want to do
[58:26] but when you're in tune with God it's
[58:28] not about somebody's trying to
[58:30] straighten you out trying to beat you up
[58:32] because you in tune the Holy Spirit
[58:34] already brought conviction
[58:37] now if the Trump will give us an
[58:39] uncertain time who's going to prepare
[58:41] themselves for battle
[58:43] now
[58:44] what happens we find that things can be
[58:48] all
[58:49] unstable unbalanced because the world
[58:52] itself is in bad shame
[58:54] amen the church world is in bad shape
[58:57] and people in their lives in the home
[59:00] our community our school everything is
[59:02] in terrible shame condition
[59:05] amen they're trying to get it
[59:07] straightened out but lord they're trying
[59:09] to get it straightened out look like
[59:10] you're getting worse
[59:12] are you with me
[59:14] so what happens amen we got we know that
[59:18] there are uncertain sounds out there
[59:20] amen they're trying to make it better
[59:23] but they're making it worse amen the
[59:27] homes are getting worse so school is
[59:29] getting worse the jobs everything is
[59:31] given uncertainty there's uncertainty
[59:34] and you said uncertain sound that means
[59:37] you can't trust it
[59:40] and when a thing is uncertain that means
[59:42] you cannot trust
[59:45] you can't put your confidence in you
[59:47] cannot trust your job
[59:50] you cannot depend
[59:53] you know sometimes it said you don't
[59:55] know whether to build a house you don't
[59:57] know what put your money in the bank you
[59:59] don't know what what you know to do this
[1:00:02] or that you don't know what to do
[1:00:04] because everything is uncertainty you
[1:00:06] don't you don't know uh you know Russian
[1:00:09] says uh United States and uh Ukraine
[1:00:12] just shot down something or playing a
[1:00:15] chrome and try to bomb the Obama kill
[1:00:19] Putin or whatever and it's in the United
[1:00:22] States and Ukraine did it they said we
[1:00:24] didn't do it so anybody can get mad and
[1:00:26] said boom I'm gonna push a button y'all
[1:00:29] try to kill me I'm gonna kill all y'all
[1:00:31] see what I'm saying and that's how
[1:00:33] uncertain things is
[1:00:34] everything is on the edge and good and
[1:00:37] the United States and we didn't do it
[1:00:39] Ukraine said we didn't do it why because
[1:00:41] we know if they want to retaliate amen
[1:00:45] we'll be gone the United States is going
[1:00:48] tomorrow the world is in chaos total
[1:00:50] chaos tomorrow
[1:00:52] I mean it can help me anytime
[1:00:55] but everything is uncertain now we're
[1:00:58] living in uncertain times
[1:01:00] everything this is an uncertain sound we
[1:01:03] don't know folks the young people don't
[1:01:05] know what to believe
[1:01:07] they look they're hearing all kind of
[1:01:08] voices
[1:01:10] they're hearing a different voice the
[1:01:12] voice that comes from Mama and the voice
[1:01:15] that come from that is not saying the
[1:01:17] same thing
[1:01:18] the voice that comes from the poor fit
[1:01:21] and the voice that comes from the school
[1:01:23] house or they're saying something
[1:01:26] different everybody it's got a voice but
[1:01:28] that must be a certain sound
[1:01:31] amen that's how all these uncertain
[1:01:35] sounds then what what can be certain
[1:01:37] what can I trust what can I depend on
[1:01:41] a human being
[1:01:43] so what happens amen because we got all
[1:01:46] these voices that we're listening to we
[1:01:49] had all these sounds what we're finding
[1:01:51] out that these things are so unstable
[1:01:55] amen we're in a a world Amen that's
[1:01:59] unstable
[1:02:01] you know the servant of God says you
[1:02:03] know you find out the one country
[1:02:07] but that you know that the Earth is
[1:02:10] pushing it out and it's getting bigger
[1:02:13] it's pushing up
[1:02:16] and in the center it's it's just pushing
[1:02:20] up and stretching out
[1:02:22] the the Earth is budging
[1:02:26] like it's going to explode
[1:02:29] and that's been a long time ago if it's
[1:02:32] pushing up like that and budging
[1:02:35] and then he was talking about the
[1:02:37] uncertainty in the season you don't know
[1:02:39] one season for another you know you
[1:02:41] don't know when to plant you don't know
[1:02:43] when to do this when uncertainty
[1:02:45] I said it was like that right there what
[1:02:49] is what is it like now
[1:02:51] it's uncertainty now
[1:02:54] if you go plan on something it might
[1:02:57] have a a a freeze and kill everything
[1:03:01] because this is supposed to be a season
[1:03:03] the plan and then another season you you
[1:03:07] come in and you're preparing for winter
[1:03:10] and it's summer
[1:03:12] you know it's 80 degrees 90 degrees in
[1:03:16] the winter time
[1:03:18] okay so who's going to prepare
[1:03:21] themselves when everything is so
[1:03:22] uncertain you don't know how to prepare
[1:03:24] for what's going on because all of this
[1:03:28] is uncertain
[1:03:29] so if the trumpet gives an uncertain
[1:03:32] sound who's going to prepare themselves
[1:03:34] for battle now what I'm saying to is
[1:03:38] very important that you and I are tuned
[1:03:41] in to God
[1:03:43] yeah you see what I'm saying because
[1:03:46] what what makes it difficult because if
[1:03:51] we have the don't count spirit
[1:03:54] if we have I I'm just I'm just religious
[1:03:57] I'm just a church member I'm just a
[1:03:59] Church Girl I don't you know I don't I
[1:04:02] don't even care what the preacher say I
[1:04:05] don't even care what you know you know
[1:04:07] and sometimes we don't even care what
[1:04:09] God say
[1:04:11] you know what I'm saying because we you
[1:04:14] know we got that little high-minded
[1:04:17] spirit that lifted up attitude and we
[1:04:20] don't care about
[1:04:22] God's word calls for humility
[1:04:26] to be humble
[1:04:28] and then you wonder why we got so much
[1:04:30] trouble in the land so why so chaotic
[1:04:35] you know we wonder why you know because
[1:04:38] everything is shaking
[1:04:40] let's go to Hebrews 12 excuse me
[1:04:43] everything is shaking brother sister I
[1:04:46] hope you see that the world is falling
[1:04:49] apart and everything is shaking
[1:04:52] and uh I'm trying to get us back to
[1:04:55] where we can hear God
[1:04:58] you know if you can hear God I may can't
[1:05:01] hear whether you're singing soprano or
[1:05:03] making it here sometimes uh kill up
[1:05:05] those you know they're playing something
[1:05:07] and I'm trying to make article and not
[1:05:10] call out don't know what they playing
[1:05:12] over there I call her thinking I'm
[1:05:14] calling oh thank the lord they're saying
[1:05:16] so-and-so we ain't saying that we say I
[1:05:19] mean it was playing so and so on I said
[1:05:21] oh you see how I
[1:05:23] I
[1:05:24] I'm trying to be complimentary and I
[1:05:27] done said thank the Lord didn't play
[1:05:30] so-and-so and they played something all
[1:05:32] together daddy we believe somewhere and
[1:05:34] this is what we played I said oh I said
[1:05:36] I better stop this is Daddy we know you
[1:05:38] can't hear
[1:05:41] you know
[1:05:42] and that's the way it is and some people
[1:05:45] spiritually just like me in the natural
[1:05:48] they can't hear they can't hear God
[1:05:51] they just can't hear God
[1:05:53] and they think you know see I know I
[1:05:57] can't hear right
[1:05:58] what about those people that came here
[1:06:00] and think they can
[1:06:03] and that's the way it is spiritually
[1:06:04] speaking folk that
[1:06:07] tone death
[1:06:09] spiritually
[1:06:11] death
[1:06:13] but think they know God they need to
[1:06:15] hear God they they're in tune with God
[1:06:18] and all kind of static going on in their
[1:06:20] life
[1:06:26] or whatever
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:29] you can't hardly hear what they talking
[1:06:31] you know but you ain't then you should
[1:06:34] keep on
[1:06:35] until you get the station is that right
[1:06:38] you got to tune in right
[1:06:40] so some some folks have been out of tune
[1:06:43] so long until they take the in tune
[1:06:46] they are because you can holler because
[1:06:49] you can hoop you know if you just tell
[1:06:54] me we know you can sing because look how
[1:06:55] you preach yeah you know you know wrong

[1:21:11] sometimes we wasting our time praying
[1:21:14] we're praying but sometimes we're
[1:21:15] wasting our time know why
[1:21:18] because they were they refused him to
[1:21:20] speak it from heaven
[1:21:22] when God spoke to them from Heaven they
[1:21:25] refused
[1:21:27] the Bible said how should we escape
[1:21:28] because judgment hit when judgments
[1:21:30] strike you know it's the hand of God
[1:21:32] striking who knows judgments striking
[1:21:35] this happening he said why a lot of
[1:21:38] happened to my child it happens because
[1:21:40] the refuses to hear them they're
[1:21:43] speaking from heaven
[1:21:45] how should we escape
[1:21:47] when God speak to you from heaven and
[1:21:50] you gonna Escape no
[1:21:53] I can't I mean I throw my hand up
[1:21:55] I I can hear the Holy Spirit speaking to
[1:21:58] me what you trying to do
[1:22:01] what are you trying to do I know you you
[1:22:04] want to see everybody help but what are
[1:22:06] you trying to do
[1:22:07] you're trying to come against me
[1:22:10] when I'm bringing judgment
[1:22:13] you trying to
[1:22:16] you move up my way in other words you
[1:22:19] take your hand off of these situations
[1:22:22] that I'm bringing judgment on
[1:22:25] you leave them alone
[1:22:28] say God
[1:22:29] yeah
[1:22:30] you know sometimes we we we want that
[1:22:33] that love that you know but but God said
[1:22:38] hold my love
[1:22:41] I chase him
[1:22:43] whom I love I chasing
[1:22:45] oh you will be
[1:22:47] now God is bringing judgment because he
[1:22:49] loved him he's chastising them because
[1:22:53] of his love
[1:22:55] and you leave it alone don't you uh
[1:22:58] that it might give the child a little
[1:23:01] spanking
[1:23:02] and mama said leave that child alone
[1:23:07] leave alone
[1:23:11] Daddy go down with his head huh next
[1:23:13] thing you know that child is a rude oh
[1:23:16] that gonna make that Mama that Mama
[1:23:18] gonna go through something you know
[1:23:21] because you told that Daddy not to
[1:23:23] straighten out that child that child
[1:23:24] said I'm gonna get away with everything
[1:23:25] now all I can do is
[1:23:30] and mama said come on
[1:23:32] leave your child alone
[1:23:36] and sometimes God get a hold of somebody
[1:23:38] and God is bringing correction
[1:23:41] chastisement
[1:23:43] and we get in the way of God
[1:23:47] you got to leave that alone
[1:23:49] leave it alone because wow you're gonna
[1:23:52] make that child in worse shape
[1:23:54] are you with me
[1:23:56] you're gonna put them in worse shape
[1:23:58] than they ever been in
[1:23:59] Shoulda let Daddy correct
[1:24:01] should have let Mama correct
[1:24:07] uh one thing though I thank God for the
[1:24:09] grace of God me and my wife didn't have
[1:24:11] that problem
[1:24:14] are you with me
[1:24:16] well a lot of houses got that kind of
[1:24:18] problem
[1:24:20] and the fruits of that division
[1:24:23] the fruits of that division don't work
[1:24:26] out and how those children respond to
[1:24:28] life
[1:24:31] are you with me
[1:24:32] the child is in chaos because why we
[1:24:36] wasn't on one according how we real your
[1:24:38] children
[1:24:41] instead of getting counseling and
[1:24:43] selling out and talk we can get on one
[1:24:45] Accord I don't need to get no counseling
[1:24:48] I know what I'm doing yeah you don't
[1:24:51] need no counselor go ahead on
[1:24:53] who's going to be at fault the child
[1:24:56] who's gonna shop with the child
[1:24:59] why
[1:25:01] if we're in tune with God
[1:25:04] it wouldn't happen
[1:25:06] it wouldn't happen because we in tune
[1:25:08] with God but if the trumpet gives away
[1:25:11] uncertain times who gonna what
[1:25:15] who gonna prepare themselves for what
[1:25:17] battle
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:22] it's all about harmonizing being in
[1:25:25] Harmony and one with another
[1:25:28] The Church Must Be In Harmony and tune
[1:25:31] together
[1:25:32] uh
[1:25:37] I remember when 10 years ago so-and-so
[1:25:40] happened and Pastor didn't do nothing
[1:25:42] about it 10 years ago
[1:25:46] when you learn better you were
[1:25:50] are you with me
[1:25:52] when you learn better you do better
[1:25:55] you know if I stay in the same shape it
[1:25:58] don't never grow get all this gray and
[1:26:00] hair in my head and then grow none
[1:26:05] are you a man
[1:26:06] but sometimes it takes a great half to
[1:26:10] give you some what wisdom
[1:26:12] are you with me
[1:26:14] then you get a little bit more wisdom
[1:26:16] you know how to handle things better
[1:26:18] than you did when you were 40.
[1:26:22] are you with me
[1:26:25] so by the grace of God but
[1:26:28] sometimes the gray hair is not respected
[1:26:31] anymore
[1:26:35] that's why
[1:26:37] the gray hair I don't want to be Gray
[1:26:43] they don't want to go through that
[1:26:49] wisdom
[1:26:51] it's not respected now
[1:26:53] those that went through the storms and
[1:26:55] went through the trials of life
[1:26:58] Harmony I ain't gonna get to the last
[1:27:01] part but
[1:27:03] one thing that is certain
