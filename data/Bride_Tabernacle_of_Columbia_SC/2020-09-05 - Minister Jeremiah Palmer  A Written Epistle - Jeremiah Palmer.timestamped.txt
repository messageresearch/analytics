[25:14] you man
[25:16] second corinthians 3 1-6
[25:21] it reads
[25:24] do we begin again to commend
[25:28] ourselves our need we
[25:31] as some others epistles of
[25:35] commendation to you all
[25:38] letters of accommodation from you
[25:42] yeah our epistles written
[25:46] in our hearts known and read of all men
[25:51] for as much as you are manifestly
[25:53] declared to be the epistles of christ
[25:57] ministered by us written not with ink
[26:01] but with the spirit of the living god
[26:03] not in tables of stone
[26:06] but in fleshly tables of the heart
[26:09] and such trust have we through christ to
[26:12] god's word
[26:14] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[26:17] to think
[26:18] anything as of ourselves but our
[26:21] sufficiency
[26:22] is of god who also had made us
[26:25] able ministers of the new testament not
[26:28] of the letter
[26:29] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[26:33] but the spirit give life let us pray
[26:36] father we thank you for your word
[26:37] tonight
[26:39] god may you list have preeminence in
[26:41] jesus name
[26:42] amen amen may be seated
[26:49] i want to use for a thought
[26:53] tonight
[26:58] a living written epistle
[27:02] a living written epistle
[27:08] i was reading
[27:11] of the morning and
[27:15] the quote of the day
[27:18] it had something in it that really
[27:22] um opened my eyes
[27:27] to what god is really looking for in
[27:30] this age
[27:34] and it came out of the message of
[27:36] influence
[27:40] and he said it like this remember
[27:45] the bible said you are living written
[27:48] epistles
[27:50] red of all men
[27:53] now many people won't read the bible
[27:57] but god has made you a living
[28:00] representation
[28:03] you are a walking letter should be a
[28:05] walking bible
[28:07] christ in you you should be the walking
[28:10] word of god
[28:12] and if you profess to be a christian and
[28:15] not
[28:16] that your influence what you're
[28:19] influencing will make you have to answer
[28:22] for many souls that day you have turned
[28:25] aside
[28:26] away from christ and as i was
[28:30] looking you know at that
[28:34] and one of my favorite scriptures that i
[28:38] read in romans a lot of times
[28:40] about presenting your body as a living
[28:43] sacrifice holy and acceptable
[28:46] unto god which is your reasonable
[28:50] service
[28:53] and i understand that god's
[28:58] life that he gave
[29:02] for us it was a sacrifice
[29:06] life
[29:09] because he didn't have to do it
[29:14] but he did it for us
[29:17] why would he do such a thing
[29:21] for somebody that didn't even recognize
[29:24] that
[29:25] he was their god
[29:30] you know it looked like that god being a
[29:32] great creator
[29:36] we ought to know that we had to come
[29:39] from
[29:40] somewhere by somebody
[29:44] but because of the amnesia that we had
[29:47] we
[29:48] [Music]
[29:49] just thought as evolution just teach it
[29:52] we just pop up from some sale somewhere
[29:57] but we had a creator
[30:00] and then his creator he had thoughts
[30:06] and you are the very thought of god
[30:11] not only that the bible that was
[30:14] written it was really
[30:18] expressing what god was thinking
[30:22] about us
[30:26] and that how that our life
[30:32] should be a living written epistle
[30:39] it's not uh the problem we're having is
[30:43] not
[30:44] with so much our clothing and
[30:47] our outward appearance is the life
[30:56] christian when you are professing
[30:59] to be a christian you're professing that
[31:04] the life of god in you
[31:09] and though the people don't
[31:11] understanding
[31:13] they will have to give an account what
[31:16] they they're doing with the life that
[31:18] god
[31:19] gave them
[31:22] because we think that we just do what we
[31:26] want because
[31:27] we our own boss
[31:32] but that's not true if i want to say
[31:35] we've been
[31:35] brought with our price and we are not
[31:38] our own
[31:42] go with me to scripture there and suck
[31:45] second
[31:46] corinthians also six
[31:58] six and sixteen
[32:11] six and sixteen and what agreement
[32:15] hath the temple of god with idols
[32:18] for ye are the temple of the living god
[32:22] as god has said i will dwell in them
[32:26] and walk in them and i will be their
[32:30] god and they shall be
[32:33] my people god
[32:37] is saying here that
[32:40] you are the living temple of god
[32:46] when you receive the holy ghost
[32:51] you become the living word
[32:54] for the day that you are living in
[32:59] there are things written of us
[33:02] that our life is supposed to manifest
[33:08] and the only way that we can do it is
[33:10] through the power of the holy ghost
[33:14] uh distilling reminding of
[33:17] uh brother ernest preaching about two
[33:20] masters
[33:22] because it's a great conflict it's a
[33:25] great struggle that
[33:27] people are are trying to live uh
[33:30] two different lives
[33:33] that's a scripturophenic
[33:36] god don't want scriptural phoenix
[33:40] god is looking for uh us to
[33:43] yield ourself to him and become a
[33:47] living sacrifice a living
[33:50] temple where god can dwell
[33:54] in
[33:57] it's important that that god
[34:00] gets in us because we have been settling
[34:04] with him with feeling him
[34:07] and him just coming on us and after a
[34:09] few days
[34:10] it wear off but god wants to abide
[34:14] forever he wants to rule
[34:20] he wants to be your god
[34:23] and if he can ever have that preeminence
[34:27] in in us see then we begin to
[34:31] yield ourself that lord not
[34:34] my will but let thy will
[34:40] no more what jeremiah want to do lord
[34:45] cause when i do that i make a mess
[34:49] i can't even keep my own self
[34:53] i need god to to be in me
[34:56] so that uh whatever that i'm doing even
[34:59] some time when
[35:01] when we get off the path god has to
[35:03] correct
[35:04] us
[35:08] i thought about something earlier
[35:11] and i had a
[35:14] incident
[35:18] you know a lot of times i don't talk
[35:20] about things a lot
[35:22] and you know my wife always said i
[35:25] learned more about you across the pulpit
[35:30] you know because we just don't tell you
[35:32] know say everything but the other day i
[35:34] was coming home off
[35:36] um monticello road and i don't know what
[35:39] name i wrote i'd turn off on but anyhow
[35:41] as i was coming you know and i was just
[35:43] thinking
[35:44] you know about something about the lord
[35:46] and i was coming and
[35:48] all of a sudden as i was driving you
[35:50] know
[35:51] uh i was coming up to this curve
[35:54] and i was facing a 18-wheeler
[35:58] and then this other car went around the
[36:01] 18-wheeler
[36:03] and so here i am now facing a head-on
[36:08] and i said to myself i have to make a
[36:10] decision what i'm going to do here
[36:14] there was a church on the right the 18
[36:16] wheeler was in
[36:18] his lane the car was in my lane head on
[36:22] and i said lord and i quickly pulled
[36:25] those able to pull over to the shoulder
[36:28] in front of the church there and i just
[36:30] sat there for a few minutes
[36:33] and i said you know sometimes we have to
[36:35] make decisions
[36:36] quickly and hoping that the decision you
[36:40] made
[36:41] was the right one and i look at it you
[36:45] know and saying that lord you know
[36:47] we don't know when and how we have to
[36:50] leave here but
[36:51] if i have to go then let me be right
[36:56] let my life be right with you
[36:59] because i would hate to have to leave
[37:01] any other way
[37:04] you know and sometimes we we look at
[37:08] ourselves and uh what
[37:11] how righteous we are but our
[37:14] righteousness is really of god
[37:17] and if that life has been transformed to
[37:21] into the into god's image
[37:24] and then you have eternal life
[37:29] and so i see the importance
[37:32] you know for of christians to
[37:36] to to really understand that
[37:39] you know you got to be born again
[37:44] that life that that god wants to
[37:47] the well you know and god wants to be in
[37:51] us more than we want it he just say
[37:55] let me in let me have control
[38:00] i've been knocking but you you let me uh
[38:04] just be a savior but i want to be your
[38:07] god
[38:08] i want to be your lord see i want to
[38:12] direct you i want to
[38:13] show you that what i can take and do
[38:17] for you because it's
[38:20] all about what he's already done for us
[38:24] our reading and i heard so i'm going to
[38:26] say you know what did they say that
[38:27] but we'll try to uh make god
[38:31] come to our standard but we got to come
[38:34] to
[38:35] god's standard we try to program
[38:39] god the lord now i want you to do this
[38:42] and
[38:42] lord i won't you do that but no no no no
[38:45] lord
[38:46] what do you have me to do
[38:50] nevertheless what yeah i might have
[38:52] plans lord but
[38:54] never lie about that whatever you have
[38:57] for me
[38:58] cause something we planning we don't
[39:01] know what we be planning
[39:04] so that's why we need god
[39:08] we need that life we need that reality
[39:12] that
[39:12] as but someone's saying that i know he's
[39:16] there
[39:18] and if he's really there then then he'll
[39:21] keep you he'll teach
[39:24] you as i look at it he'll be your
[39:27] protector
[39:29] he'll be your shield you know
[39:32] he'll be uh everything to you
[39:36] because we understand that life here
[39:40] you know it's it's unpredictable
[39:44] things that happen beyond our control
[39:49] sometimes catch us by surprise catch us
[39:52] unaware and sometimes it really
[39:56] hurts the things that we have to
[39:59] you know deal with and go through
[40:03] here and sometimes if you don't
[40:06] really have god there you know in you
[40:09] you won't be able to stand against it
[40:12] that's why you know that uh i'll be the
[40:15] scripture to say that
[40:16] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[40:20] he said the spirit of the law will raise
[40:23] up a standard against it
[40:26] see that's why we need that living
[40:29] reality
[40:31] now talking about written epistles
[40:36] you are supposed to be a we are supposed
[40:40] to be
[40:42] the living manifested word fire were
[40:45] they
[40:47] we got a portion that god has allowed it
[40:52] just like in every age
[40:54] they had uh a portion of the word that
[40:58] they were supposed to manifest
[41:02] in the generation that they live
[41:05] then and every age
[41:09] had that and we have it
[41:13] but no other age has uh
[41:17] the fullness of the word like like
[41:20] we have it and you know when much is
[41:23] given much is required
[41:27] in other words it's like a child that's
[41:30] growing up
[41:31] you won't give them much responsibility
[41:33] because
[41:34] they are not mature enough to handle it
[41:38] so you just give them a little simple
[41:40] you know and god does this as we
[41:43] grow and as we mature
[41:46] spiritually speaking god then begin to
[41:50] acquire
[41:51] more at us we no longer can use that
[41:54] excuse
[41:55] i don't know what i'm doing you know
[42:00] but now it's rather not you're going to
[42:03] obey god
[42:05] you're going to let god have the
[42:07] preeminence in your life
[42:10] and that's the what god really looking
[42:13] for he wants
[42:14] preeminence because god wants to
[42:18] use you for whatever
[42:21] he has for you to do
[42:25] and the very word that has been spoken
[42:30] you know and as i i understand you know
[42:33] as
[42:34] you know the servant of god was
[42:35] preaching and
[42:37] teaching you know things and you know
[42:40] it's so strange that uh that the people
[42:44] that are supposed to understand
[42:47] the word uh it's like
[42:50] they're missing the real reason
[42:54] of uh a malachi full ministry and what
[42:57] the purpose is
[42:59] you know it's not just to make us
[43:02] excited that's all right
[43:04] in the shout and that's all right you
[43:07] know but
[43:08] to live the word to manifest
[43:12] it that you in the world become
[43:16] one and that when people
[43:19] see you then they're seeing uh
[43:22] the living reality of god life
[43:26] displaying in you
[43:29] that you become god's mouth
[43:33] when they see you they see god because
[43:36] many people
[43:37] never go to church that's why
[43:40] the life that we live not just
[43:43] in church but more so out
[43:46] in your workplace in your school place
[43:49] wherever you go
[43:51] that life of god should be uh
[43:54] um just pouring out
[43:58] it should be such a reflection that when
[44:01] people come in your presence they'll say
[44:04] excuse me
[44:06] um there's something about you
[44:09] you know it's not what about you but
[44:11] it's that your
[44:12] life has been transformed
[44:15] by god by the holy ghost
[44:19] and you now become a living reality of
[44:23] god
[44:24] making himself manifest in flesh
[44:27] again i got two or three things that i i
[44:32] want to
[44:33] just read but you know as i'm
[44:37] been telling you know speaking to people
[44:40] you know now and i understand that
[44:43] uh the the best sermon
[44:47] even any preacher can preach is the one
[44:49] that he can
[44:50] live i believe it was a man one time
[44:54] that
[44:55] uh was asking uh um alabama used a
[44:58] little scripture about a man who went to
[45:00] church and
[45:01] uh he got saved and this preacher wanted
[45:04] to know
[45:05] what sermon it was you know that he
[45:08] preached
[45:08] you know that caused him to get saved it
[45:11] was it a
[45:12] certain song he said no he said what it
[45:14] did said that he said no
[45:16] he said but it was a lady that lived
[45:20] such a humble life
[45:23] and he got thirsty of what she
[45:27] had you know and i think that's
[45:30] real is true you know that you know you
[45:33] we can't
[45:34] make ourself that but if we can
[45:37] yield ourselves to god and let god
[45:41] you know have the preeminence and and
[45:44] empty out
[45:46] you know this stuff that's that's in us
[45:50] get rid of us and and let god have
[45:53] control
[45:54] because as long as you're in the way god
[45:57] can have the preeminence
[46:00] here he said now
[46:03] what it is you are written epistles the
[46:08] bible said now
[46:10] what is in a pistol is a written word
[46:15] and you are written in other words
[46:18] you read it like this you it is
[46:21] your written epistle or you are the word
[46:25] that has been written made
[46:28] manifest what was spoken
[46:32] by i was serving this hour
[46:35] you know there is a people lies that's
[46:39] going to
[46:40] manifest that it's not going to just be
[46:44] a label we call ourself
[46:46] message but it's going to be a
[46:49] manifestation
[46:51] of your life that the word has
[46:54] transformed
[46:55] you into the very things that he spoke
[46:59] see because just saying i'm in the
[47:02] message
[47:02] you know we use that as a sometimes a
[47:05] compound
[47:06] to be identified with a prophet i'll be
[47:09] identified with
[47:10] a you know a certain church affiliation
[47:14] but until our life has been transformed
[47:18] into the very image of god
[47:21] we missed it
[47:25] but god is requiring
[47:28] we will say that god is looking for
[47:30] perfection
[47:34] not our perfect but his perfection
[47:38] but i realized that you know it takes a
[47:41] sacrifice
[47:43] it takes a people that's that
[47:46] understand that uh you know sometimes
[47:50] you know i think that we too loose
[47:55] you know we just we were always like
[47:58] that
[48:00] we used to be more conscientious about
[48:02] the presence of god and
[48:04] and what we would say you know we had a
[48:07] little more
[48:08] i don't know uh consecrated about
[48:11] ourselves that
[48:12] even the way we came to church
[48:16] we were more reverent understanding that
[48:20] we coming to hear from god
[48:23] i believe our minds were in a different
[48:26] mode than what it is now
[48:29] we came with an expectation
[48:32] we came looking for god to do something
[48:36] and god met us
[48:39] but it was our mind-setting
[48:43] but something happened i believe paul
[48:47] said you did run well but what hindered
[48:50] you
[48:51] you know what hinder us we did
[48:55] we hinder ourselves we are our worst
[48:59] enemy but we got to understand that
[49:03] sometimes
[49:04] we got to stop and shake ourselves
[49:07] and understand you know what am i here
[49:10] for
[49:12] what did i come to do what am i doing
[49:16] with the life that god gave me
[49:20] am i really manifesting the word for my
[49:24] hour are we just going through the lot
[49:26] of motions
[49:29] he says
[49:32] you are written epistle you are the word
[49:34] that has been written
[49:36] made manifested nothing can be added to
[49:39] it
[49:40] you can't say i'm a written epistle and
[49:43] living some
[49:44] other kind of a life but what
[49:47] this had already wrote
[49:50] and he was given an example you know
[49:52] what not i wanted a brother i'm not
[49:54] going to get into that but
[49:55] he was given this example you know i had
[49:58] a brother that was trying to
[50:00] hang him up you know on something
[50:03] and he kind of just uh
[50:06] you know was aware of what they were
[50:08] trying to do
[50:10] so he kind of just you know got out of
[50:12] it and brought something to them
[50:14] you know what not but uh i believe that
[50:17] more so as we coming to the closing
[50:21] you know of the hour and we
[50:24] see that uh the great falling of
[50:27] way of people just dropping off and
[50:30] going backwards and being so unconcerned
[50:34] about their christian walk
[50:37] we realized that you know uh that
[50:40] we can allow that
[50:44] you've got to do something i got to do
[50:46] something
[50:48] i can't wait on on on the preacher
[50:51] you say come on y'all come on y'all come
[50:53] on by
[50:54] now you ought to be more concerned about
[50:57] your own soul salvation
[50:59] the bible says encourage your own self
[51:04] not wait to somebody the next preacher
[51:07] or the next
[51:07] tent me they may not be anymore
[51:11] we've got to learn now you've got to
[51:14] know how to stir up that with is in you
[51:18] you've got to understand that if your
[51:21] fire is going
[51:22] out put wood on it oh what
[51:25] that what you would do if it was winter
[51:27] time and you tell them you freezing and
[51:29] you sit in front of a fight that's been
[51:31] dying out
[51:33] you got the wood there and everything to
[51:35] go on it and you sit there and say
[51:37] i'm getting cold then
[51:40] grab the wood put it on the fire
[51:44] grab the word put it on your fire
[51:47] get stirred again don't wait to end
[51:51] about it
[51:52] you do it that's a lot of time that we
[51:55] wait we what are we waiting on who are
[51:58] we waiting on
[52:00] we've had preachers from all over the
[52:02] world
[52:04] you know no doubt we should have been
[52:06] gone by now
[52:08] but we're still here
[52:11] being that it must be isn't
[52:15] quite ready yet and i believe that's why
[52:18] the bible said
[52:19] be ye ready
[52:22] god trying with all that he has
[52:26] given us and everything that has been
[52:29] hidden from time
[52:30] past he has revealed it he's made known
[52:34] to
[52:34] us how to prepare ourselves
[52:37] for the rapture and i'll be viewing
[52:40] revelation his
[52:41] bride has made herself
[52:44] she didn't wait on anybody no she knew
[52:48] she had all the things to get ready
[52:51] so she made herself ready that's what we
[52:54] got to do
[52:56] make you like you do for work who wakes
[52:59] you up
[53:00] nobody don't believe this thing get up
[53:01] get up get up
[53:03] you set that clock what do you do you
[53:05] made yourself ready
[53:08] you prepare yourself for whatever it is
[53:11] that you need to do
[53:12] the way you can get to that job properly
[53:15] and on time
[53:16] and if you can do that for a natural job
[53:19] how much more we ought to do
[53:21] for god
[53:25] yes it's time to prepare
[53:28] i want to tell you something if you're
[53:32] not preparing for the things of god are
[53:34] you preparing for something else
[53:37] and no doubt i know no one wants to be
[53:40] left behind
[53:42] and give it a close he said now when you
[53:45] go to a trial to be a witness
[53:49] you are testifying for somebody see
[53:52] and jesus said the scriptures are
[53:57] the script they that bear record of me
[54:00] then he was god's word expressed
[54:05] in human flesh jesus was
[54:08] he was the very written word
[54:11] in flesh it was
[54:15] already written of him in the book
[54:19] and he came to manifest that
[54:23] which was written
[54:28] he said they didn't bear record of me
[54:31] then he was god's word expressed god
[54:33] promised made
[54:34] flesh to express itself that's what
[54:38] christ was
[54:39] the word of god expressed in
[54:42] human form the word of god expressed
[54:48] in human form and that's what god is
[54:52] looking for even today he looking for
[54:55] the word of god to be
[54:56] expressed in who in you and i
[55:01] you will be the very expression of
[55:04] what's been
[55:05] written in the bible
[55:09] not just the message the message the
[55:11] message
[55:13] that's letter and as paul said it not
[55:17] tables of a letter but of the spirit
[55:22] he said now that's the reason christian
[55:25] i think
[55:26] is so real tonight so that we should
[55:29] live the right kind of a life because as
[55:32] many people won't take
[55:34] time to read the bible but they'll read
[55:36] you
[55:37] and see they'll read you see you are a
[55:41] written epistle of god
[55:43] a real true born-again christian
[55:47] is the word expressed again because
[55:50] you're written epistles of god of all
[55:53] men
[55:53] what type of person should we to be
[55:57] if we know that our lives is a open
[56:00] living bible my
[56:06] it shall make us caution
[56:09] of our own confession
[56:13] and that we confess something and don't
[56:16] and don't possess it
[56:20] and if we don't have it
[56:23] then we need to get really to the altar
[56:26] begin to cry out lord
[56:29] help me to become the very
[56:33] living word expressed in this day
[56:38] i believe that is is the cry you know
[56:41] uh there seemed uh a time past
[56:44] that the uh a settling down
[56:48] time now is i believe for every one of
[56:51] us as the bible says to
[56:53] examine ourselves
[56:56] and see where we really act
[56:59] whether we just going to church or
[57:02] whether we were really
[57:03] getting a hold of god like we ought to
[57:07] or whether we just going through the
[57:09] motions of it
[57:11] because god he's looking
[57:14] for you and i in this thing
[57:17] to be the very word
[57:20] written in in human form again
[57:25] the word made flesh in you
[57:29] in me and when people see our lives then
[57:33] it said
[57:34] dear christians why because they see the
[57:38] life of god
[57:40] made manifest again how many of you
[57:43] really want that tonight amen
[57:45] you want your life to be the living
[57:47] expressed image of god
[57:50] lord help me to be the living word
[57:53] tonight

[57:58] that
