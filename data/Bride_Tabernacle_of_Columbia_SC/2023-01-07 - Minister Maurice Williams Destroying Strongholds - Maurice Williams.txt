Lord tonight how many glad to be a believer tonight here second Corinthians 10th chapter we're going to start the third verse amen for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh amen if you was to read it maybe an NIV version and say for though we live in this world we don't wage war as the world does amen the fourth verse it reads for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're not worldly weapons amen but what about these weapons but a mighty through God Amen to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations amen how many know you got to get that imagination under control and if you can't get your mind under control of this hour the devil will wreck havoc all over your life amen but God has given us something to take care of that he said casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God Amen anything that exalted itself against the knowledge of God that's Antichrist spirit amen but we got something that can bring that in the line as well amen and bring it into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen you know from time to time the strongholds that arise in people's life amen it might have been strongholds you had to overcome last year man it might be strongholds you have to overcome even into this man but I want to remind you of tonight is by through the grace of God he's given us something that can overcome each and every stronghold and tear it completely down tonight I'll just I'll speak on a little title of destroying strongholds amen let's just buy heads tonight father God in the name of Jesus Lord let your people Lord we've gathered together Lord and Lord no doubt Lord many may have had different activities they had to accomplished today Lord with work and school and different things father God but Lord we've set aside This Time Lord to come together collectively Lord to worship you father God to look into your word Lord and Lord we know that these times Lord these moments these things are precious father God because it allows us to be able to stand in the midst of a dark and evil age just exist Lord so Lord I pray that you will blessed each and every saint that breast pressed their way out tonight father God Lord I pray that Lord you will move me out of the way for the preaching of your word father God because Lord all of these things are in vain Lord unless your people are blessed father God but Lord we know wherever you are father God the blessings abound father God and wherever two or three are gathered in Your Name Lord Joy promise to be in the midst Lord we thank you for that Lord we look to you right now in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ May the Saints say Amen praise the Lord you could be seated tonight amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord you know we still pretty new into the new year amen and you know anytime you you start a new year I think it's always good to reevaluate things I I think it's good to always take time the Bible says you got to examine yourself for it says the letter man examine himself amen and when we take time we we see the things that we overcome amen we we see the things that we had some difficulty against say man we we could take time we look at our victories amen because sometimes we we get so busy and so caught up in life that we forget about the victories that the Lord brought us through amen and at the same time we can look at the battles amen that we had overcome the the hard things amen and as we look at those things the enemy always has a goal of keeping you from pressing towards the mark meanwhile the word of God Amen in the ministry we're always pushing you to press towards the mark amen and as you press towards the mark the enemy now he's a good enemy he's not just going to let you press towards the mark but he wants to put things in your way to keep you from progressing towards the mark he wants to put things in your way to keep you from becoming a manifested son or daughter of God and maybe you can have some minor victories and maybe you can win some small battles but he wants to keep you from fully becoming somebody that can tear his kingdom down so what he does is he uses something called strongholds sometimes amen strongholds are things that you have to overcome strongholds are things that the enemy is entrenched in and that you are going to have to fight to be able to overcome some battles are won and fought easily but some batters you have to sit there and press your way with it amen and by the grace of God that shouldn't scare you because greatest he that is in US the heat that is in the world and there's something that almighty God placed within you that is going to allow you to press the bell in this hour you know when we start to talk about strongholds sometimes people picture these old big things or big things uh big sins that you got to overcome but the strongholds can just be the little things amen a stronghold can just be just a little thing that's just enough to keep you from being everything that God calls you to be amen a little thing that might be just enough from keeping you from being exactly where almighty God wants you to be amen now for you to be able to come out to church tonight amen for you to be able to walk as a message believe in this hour you already have to manifest the testimony over overcome you already have to manifest the testimony of somebody that's overcome stronghold after stronghold amen you you can't walk as a believer in this hour amen except you've been overcome you can't walk us believe in yourself accept you've overcome some strongholds amen God presents challenges before us amen and by the grace of God we meet those challenges and we cast it down amen if there is a stronghold odd challenge that would keep you from going further with God Amen by the grace of God we got to cast it down sometimes people go through yeah amen and they say well well you know I struggled through this thing and I fought through this thing and you know I barely held on but we look to overcome more things in 2023 than we did in 2022 amen we don't want our testimony to be that we always fighting the same battles amen year after year God is looking for some people to show some growth amen if you got a child you expect that child to show some growth amen year after year you don't expect them to be wearing the same size clothes and so it is for the believer we show growth through the things that we've been through we show grow through the things that we overcome amen and see your testimony has to have a different mindset in this hour amen you know I know sometimes we have to testimony oh God 2022 it was a hard year and I barely made and I barely overcome and not might be true amen because God knows I mean it was some difficult things the Saints had to face amen but you know I like it brother Simmons when people have some strength to their testimony amen and say you know uh it'll be good for somebody's testimony to be you know 2022 was a hard year but nevertheless I feel closer to him than I ever felt before amen poor to God Amen 2022 might have been a hard year but he's revealed more of himself to me then he's ever revealed to me before Hallelujah glory to God it might have been some hard things I have to overcome from time to time but I see him more clearly now than I ever seen him before I've seen just how much different I am from the rest of the world than what I saw before and now I got a clear of you and I got a clear Revelation that this world is not my home but God is bringing me somewhere he's positioning me in something he's using my trials to mold me from time to time and I will be that perfect image of Jesus Christ that he wants me to be able to express in this hour you know when we talk about strongholds amen those things are all around us Saints amen y'all know all kind of different levels amen you know we always talk about in the flesh level in the flesh around me man you got to overcome flesh battles I mean we know about those things amen you got overcome mind battles amen you know about those things amen enemy battling you on every side of your mind amen but we have to overcome no strong Jose man there's strongholds in the religious realm amen them strongholds in the religious realm it'll have somebody so bound up in a denominational system amen and they esteeming the word of the bishop hide in the word of God Amen they esteeming the Creed of the church hide in the word of God Amen that's a religious stronghold amen and it don't got to be just the nominational system nowadays that non-denominational system amen they got the concert music in the church they got the lights off and the lights and they're looking blue and everybody having a good time because they got the pajamas on in church amen and people think that they got freedom but that thing is a stronghold amen there's strong holes in the religious realm amen when you look amen it's strongholds in the spiritual room as well God is allowing the enemy to fight you on every turn amen and where the enemy has a desire Amen to do everything possible to you to keep you from becoming that manifested son or daughter of God to keep you from coming that fully adopted son or daughter of God Amen were you fully manifesting everything within the kingdom of God that he brought you into amen well you showing your maturity as a Believer amen well you're showing that you can name things amen and claim things and walk just exactly how the father walked because he brought you through the right training amen and God is using these things to bring us to that point Paul said that though we walk in the flesh we do not walk after the fleshaven when we start to talk about these flesh battles amen you can't just use your flesh to overcome your flesh amen people try to do that all the time and they lose every time it has to be something more than you to be able to be overcome amen when you get to the start of New Year everybody make resolutions we're gonna do this different we're gonna lose five pounds 10 pounds 20 pounds amen we're going to overcome all these different things amen but what happens is that flesh is so strong and that flesh is so powerful and habits can be so hard to break amen and you might start off on January 1st and January 2nd so you know I'm gonna change my diet I'm not gonna eat no more this amen I put away the cookies I'm put away them Snickers balls I'm gonna put away that Fried Chicken from Publix and all that stuff but put all that stuff away man then you give it a day or two amen now all of a sudden it's getting about nine or ten o'clock at night and that salad that you ate for dinner just saying cut now all of a sudden that stomach start talking to you and then you see you know let me go in the pantry I got a little bit of a little cookie still left in that pantry let me see what's in there man you go in the pantry you look you see the cookies hey man you say well I'll just get one or two amen and all of a sudden that one or two turned to two or three because you always had that same habit that was there but there really was no change to get rid of the Habit amen if we try to fight Flash battles amen the things that the enemy will try to use and I like to him and say man if we try to fight those fleshly send battles amen as just with the flesh we will lose every time it would just be a New Year's resolution to you that you would fight and you will failing man but God has given us something different the weapons of our Warfare are not commonly men but they're Mighty through God and I'm here to tell you if almighty God is on your side fighting a battle for you amen but almighty God is on your side amen pushing you forward amen it'll help the brothers be able to overcome those lust Spirits amen ever help the sisters be able to overcome the jealousy Spirits amen and the inadequacy Spirits amen because the enemy try to beat the sisters down to make them feel like they're not enough amen when you more than enough amen enemy got all kind of things that he'll use amen but God has given us something to be able to beat him at every turn people had strongholds of drugs and alcohol and different things live in all kinds of ways God has allowed people to overcome those things I don't take those things for granted amen you know nowadays it seems like people have to preach and it's like even in the master church I know it's a lot of the meetings that I'm going to the brothers are preaching about pornography amen and you would think well I was being mashed believed people don't got to worry about it you have to watch people amen and preach against those Spirits amen because technology has made things so easy man take out this little uh smartphone pull up his couple Pages amen and he doesn't subscribe to him he looking at these things amen and those things become strongholds for people and if you don't got the right weapon to beat the stronghold amen the enemy will take you down amen but God has given some brothers some strength baby God has given some sisters some strength amen that these strongholds amen that that maybe the rest of wise the struggling with he's giving you something through the power the blood of Jesus Christ that allows you to overcome those strongholds of the flesh Hallelujah the strongholds of the Mind amen those are powerful strongholds amen because your mind is developing to
