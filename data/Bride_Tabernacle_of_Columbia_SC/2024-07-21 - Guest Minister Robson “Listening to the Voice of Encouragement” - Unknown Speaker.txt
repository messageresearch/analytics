without God Amen but it's because God saved you yes Lord that's what it is are you happy today amen you know I heard an orgon in the office and I was like man I'll tell you who that is there's Caleb I'm going to preach about Caleb today the lord gave me a little thought it's not a conviction message it's an encouraging message amen I I believe that we need to encourage one another amen you know and I I was sitting back there and I was like Lord I I don't know where to really go you know there's moments in a Minister's life you have so many mind battles [Music] and sometimes you're wondering is this the right thought is this what people need or is there something else and I battled all night and battled all morning I guess the only thing to do is just preach amen but I believe the Lord if there's some people that are here discouraged you can leave here encouraged amen amen amen and I believe that amen amen just keep playing that softly Amazing Grace let's go before the father gracious Heavenly Father Jes Lord Jesus father I'm already aware of how close you are father you're here in our midst this morning father you said in your word where two or three would Gather in your name yes Lord Jesus father there you would come down in their midst Lord and you'd begin to fellowship with us father and I'm reminded back in the very beginning of time when you created Adam father Yes Lord Jesus Lord and you from a part of him made his wife yes Lord father and you created them in your likeness the scripture tells us Lord because you desired something father you desired a fellowship yes Lord you desired somebody to walk with you yes Lord you desired someone to talk with you to know you as their friend Father and then a separation would happen we know the scripture father Yes Lord but you made a Plan of Redemption yes Lord to bring back a restored fellowship with you once again but father I often times have thought if Eve father as she had done what she done Lord father if there was one thing that if she could have looked back on her life she was missing something she was missing a fellowship with you she was missing as the prophet taught us is walking in the cool of the evening with you father and I I I believe that if she could have done it all over again that she would have never done what she had done and she would have wanted that Unity always father but we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and we ask you just now father to come down father and speak lip to ear to every heart and every being that is in this building right now father if there's someone that doesn't know you I pray they'd come to know you yes Lord father and I pray Lord Jesus says there's things in people's lives yes Lord father there's things in my life I need you to move on Lord father and I'm honest enough to say it I need you yes Lord father more than ever before there's a people here that need you yes Lord father just come down and meet us this morning and we will be care careful to give you all the glory all the honor and the praise amen do you love the Lord this morning amen amen if you have your Bibles we're going to go right into the word thank you musicians done a wonderful job there's a wonderful atmosphere atmosphere here amen do you believe that amen amen if you have your Bibles we want to look in the scripture over at numbers the 13th chapter and we'll take our thought from the 30th verse amen and when you're there say Amen now the Bible the Bible would read in Caleb Ste the people Steed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it let's read that one more time and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and someone say this with me and possess it and possess it for we are well aable this morning I'd like to take a thought on listening to the voice of encouragement amen with a subtitle of we are well able amen amen do you believe that this morning amen amen now you may be seated sorry I was sitting here and looking at this scripture the other night and I better start my timer so I don't hold you 3 hours you guys wouldn't have a problem with that I'm sure but amen now I was looking at this scripture and I seen how in the scripture here we look earlier on and Moses is telling or or calling out a people in the very beginning of the 13th chapter Moses the Lord had spoke to Moses and said there's going to be a certain people of every tribe that you will have and they're going to be the spies that will go into this land now we know that this is when they're at Kadesh and barnea now Moses sends every man and I'm not even going to attempt to say all the tribes names and all their names you know because it's hard but we know what the scripture says and so he calls out these people and sends 12 Spies as we find in the scripture that there are 12 Spies that would go and two of them would be Joshua and Caleb Joshua and Caleb would they'd go over to this uh place and spy out the land now this isn't unfamiliar to you you would know what I'm talking about but I'm trying to give you the natural side of it here right now because I'm going to type it back to where we are now now we see in in the 27th verse it says and they told him that we came unto the land with thou sentest sent us and surely it floweth cuz Moses when he told them go into this land you're going to see what's there is it good land or is it bad land is it able to be taken or is it not what what kind of uh um is there is there uh milk and honey or what's the fruit of that land he wanted to know and he wanted to report he wanted to hear the report from the from his spies that he would send and so they come and the the the the the 10 of them are saying we can't do this we can't do do this it's not able we're we're we're small in their sight we're not able to possess this land this is yeah there's good fruit there we brought you the fruit but we we can't do this and we find this here in the 27th chap or the 27th verse and it says and they told him and said we came unto the land with thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and it and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in that land so what they're doing now as we find in this scripture is they're not looking at what God can do they're looking at their circumstances they're looking at what's around them they're looking at the hurts they're looking at different things and they're looking at the size of their enemy they're looking at the strength of their enemy they're looking at things that we shouldn't Focus on but because someone is on the Intercourse of this and they're he's he's battling them taking them off track and showing them hey I'm going to discourage you you can't do this you're not going to fight this battle you're not able to make it you aren't good enough and he will always tell you that you're not good enough and we find this here these 10 but there's two that will stand up amen out of the mouth of how many witnesses two or three Witnesses we find that Jose or Joshua and Caleb would stand up and say we are able we are able to take this land we are a no matter what would come against us what would go to us what what the hurt is or what the Brokenness is whatever it doesn't matter we can take this land am that's right we can fight for it we can make it amen and we find this how then Caleb would stand up and the Bible says he still now I'm going to give you the the definition of what stilled would mean stilled is an intransitive verb that means to become motionless or silent now we already know what the stilled would mean but I'm giving you the definition just so for the younger would know now motionless or silent to make something stop moving or become more calm so he's calming everyone's nerves he's telling people hey before we do anything we got to make sure our mind is Right amen we got to make sure that we're thinking things through we got to make sure that we stand on God's word about this because when God says that I will never leave you nor forsake you it's a promise amen and if and if he won't leave us on the battlefield he won't leave us at the house if he won't leave us at the house he won't leave us on the battlefield he's going to be with us everywhere that we go because he loves you and he desires that Fellowship with you and now the after Caleb would steal the people before Moses now brother Brandon would tell us that Moses was God to the people he was God to the people he was telling people what the word of the Lord was now Joshua we would find is a type of the Holy Ghost amen Joshua would be there guiding the people and telling them hey we're going to make this through Caleb was a spokesperson for Joshua and Moses amen now to possess the next thing that he would say is not only am I going to steal you but I'm going to possess we're going to possess this now to possess is to have belonging to one or to own having belonging to or to own now brother brandom would say in this message he says now cadish there this is the message um Israel and the church number four now [Music] Kadesh and there he said now you go out and spy out God sent them Moses Moses never so so Moses what had happened is God had told Moses these are the people and Moses just did what the Lord told him to do called out these people now God sent them over and said go over and spy out the land and come back and tell us whether it's a good land or a bad land whether we can take it or or what and that and the other you go over there find out and the 12 men went over they cut a great cluster of grape you know about the Harlot Rahab and so forth all right they went over and this cluster of grapes returned back but listened to the report of the 12 men or the the 10 brother brand would then correct it and say and the 10 of the 12 said oh they are fearful look over there what a sight listen to this and now we turn over to the 17th verse or the 27th verse rather to read goes ahead and tells us the men that was sent out and there or and when he return when they returned back the hearts were fainting so now we find a scripture for this that man's hearts are failing for fear and it's as we look I'm going to drop that here and as we look now in today's society we have reports of different things going on in the nation we have different things that are happening and man if they don't know God their hearts are beginning to fail for fear they're beginning to look at circumstances of who's going to win the next election and who's going to be the next governor and who's going to be and they're looking at the circumstance and looking at their rulers they're looking at things of the natural of their uh uh of of right here right now and they're failing to look back to the author and the finisher of the faith the one who knows the beginning to the end and it's because there's a heart issue it's because there's people that don't know their God it's because there's people that need to know God but they don't know where to find him because it seems like the courthouse has taken God out of the church or toen him out of the system and took God out of the government when in the very beginning this nation was built on under God this is what this nation was built under is to have the faith it you know it was a part of this system that we should have God in the churches it's a part of the system that we should have God in our houses we should have a freedom of speech we should have a freedom of religion but we see how the government is slowing slowly taking it and man's hearts are failing for fear because they look so highly to their government and I'm not getting into the politics because I realized that brother brandham said that they are of the devil and that is the truth but I'm just saying that when man looks at the fear his heart is going to fear when he hears rumors of wars he's going to fear because there's something missing amen amen now I I'm just trying to bring this down right here how to know your God they need to know God and Caleb was trying to get them to listen to their God Amen he was stealing them making them be quiet listen because in order for God to speak there has to be silence amen he was bringing a silence so he can speak to the hearts amen because Caleb said we can take this land amen Caleb said that we can do this we are well able somebody say that we are well able are well aable we are well able to take the land amen we are well able to do it but it's so easy to get [Music] discouraged it's so easy to get broken it's so easy to get tried amen it's so easy to get hurt and and many times we dwell we dwell on our hurt and our Brokenness and our condition and and what the doctor's report is and we dwell on what things of the natural are and we know that the natural types of Supernatural but we are looking at how we hurt and we break and we need encouragement amen amen scripture tells us we need to encourage one another amen brother brandom continues on and says I like that my just a little further but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report listen to that so the people brought up an evil [Music] report and they had searched out the children of Israel saying the land which we have gone to search it is land that eateth up with inhabitants thereof and the people that we saw in it are men of great stature listen to that and it goes on to say we look like grasshoppers Hoppers imagine that you're looking out you're trying to find a report I would be scared too if I saw a man who was a giant and I'm looking at my size man I'm small I'm probably a grasshopper in his sight too you know and so I can see why they would get discouraged because it's so easy when you see that doctor's report says that you have stage four cancer and you look at it it's scary it's bigger than you because now you're looking at it in front of you and I'm speaking this from experience my wife's aunt she got diagnosed with cancer and I watched how at first they said it was stage five and I watched how she took it at first she was like well I'll just trust God now now the doctor being a Christian doctor he said don't claim it he said this is what the report says but don't claim it amen amen and she for a while didn't claim it but then she got discouraged because she began to pull out that report she went to the doctor's reports she went to the doctor's offices and she began to get fear ful even though she knows where she's going but she was looking at the circumstance she was looking at this thing now we know that this is a spirit this spirit is attacking her and the Lord told me to go over there and pray I went drove two hours to go pray for her and I prayed and two days later she tells me that she feels different she goes to the next doctor's office and the doctor would tell her we can't find a trace of [Music] cancer shortly after that then they look in another part of her body and they find cancer there and so this cancer had gone it went and then it came back and this doctor that's why the doctor again would say don't claim it don't claim it but now the doctor said medically I don't think we could do much for her so now she's at this place where she just wants to trust the Lord but you see and that's how crucial it is that we trust the Lord amen amen a circumstance can bring you astray it can hurt you amen if you're looking for a perfect Pastor or a perfect preacher you won't find it amen amen you won't find it you won't find a perfect song leader you won't find a perfect musician I'm a musician myself I know what it's like to mess up get a complex I don't want people to hear me play because when you mess up and some people they'll man you messed up on that song and there's those that are man you did so good we all know those two different types of people obviously want to hear the voice of encouragement amen do you love the Lord amen amen Amen brother Brandon would continue on man it seems like it's taking me forever to go through this quote doesn't it all right 10 of them now the church Church [Music] came and it's now to the place where we've come down through the Luther age the Methodist age and the Pentecostal age and on down to a place and now some of the Full Gospel turned family against Divine Healing are firmly against Divine Healing believe that it wasn't even in the atonement well it's got to a place friends where you it's getting horrible out here isn't that true it is getting horrible oldtime religion they say it's something that's passed long ago don't have it it's too much we're living in a modern day and we've got to get modern ideas we've got to have Shuffle boards in the church pingpong games and everything to hold our young people my if that if that's what it is you know brother Brandon would go on he might as well just stop preaching he said because if if if the gospel can't save them if the gospel can't change them then why why should we even preach it because if we're only going for an entertainment on a Sunday and we're going to go back to wherever we go on a Monday and a Tuesday and forget about you know I was listening to a preacher the other it was actually CT Townson and he was uh preaching on um owning you're wrong or some admitting you're wrong and he he made a statement he said his mom had told him years and years ago that sin will keep you from this Bible or this Bible will keep you from sin and man that's struck me because it's plain and it's true if you're a sinner why don't you want to read the Bible because it exposes you amen but when you are reading your Bible it will make you realize that sin stay away amen and it will make you separate from that old man it will make you separate from all those you know and I was just very it it really spoke to me when he said that that if you that sin will keep you from the Bible and your Bible will keep you from sin and then he goes on to saying that we don't need to be a part-time Christian amen we should read our Bible on a Monday and on a Tuesday and on a Wednesday and a Thursday and a Friday I I'm just saying this to say say that we need to be a Christian on a Sunday just as much as we need to be on a Monday we need to be a Christian on a Tuesday just as much as we need to be on a Wednesday we need to be a Christian all the time because we can't let the hurts and the Brokenness determine who we are we can't let our Brokenness develop who we are we need to get up out of our little moping stage we got to stand up and say we can take the land if you have a hurt you got to go and meet the problem if you got a Brokenness you got to go and speak to the Brokenness you got to go and and you got to claim your healing if you're sick in your body you need to go make it and you got to go and find an altar or something and you got to say Lord I mean business I need healing I need you like never before I need salv if you're not saved if you're an unsaved young person or older person whoever you might be if you don't know God and you need God in your soul you can just call on the Lord and he'll come down to you because he said you have not because you ask not and that's what he's Desiring is someone to ask if they want a relationship with him you just need to ask him for that relationship if you want to know him you got to ask him to know him if you want to be with him you got to ask to be with him you got to invite him I preached a sermon a few years ago on welcoming the unwelcomed Christ now brother Brandon would make this uh uh he would preach this sermon the unwelcomed Christ Christ but I took it and I said welcoming the unwelcomed Christ cuz brother brandom in that message showed us that Jesus was unwelcomed and he showed him what would make him welcomed it was a woman vile and ill and an ill- famed woman who would go down and cry tears at the Master's feet amen who would say God I'm a sinner amen I'm in need of a savior you know what she was doing brother brandham said that she was crying out tears of repentance they were tears of repentance all the tears that she washed his feet with she washed all the dirt off his feet just think about that for a few minutes she washed she got down on her knees in front of the Lord of lords and washed his feet with her tears not anybody else's notice this it wasn't anybody else's experience erience amen true amen amen it was her experience it was her time amen and when she meant business she got down on her knees nobody else had to do it for her she got down on her knees and washed his feet that's not all she did then she anointed him and kissed him continually amen she got down to business amen sometimes that's what we got to do we were all a type of that woman we were all that woman at one point and we needed to make stuff right amen now Caleb he tells him we can take this land and they go over to take the land we're well able friends what's holding you this morning we are well able amen amen if you need Deliverance you got to step out amen amen amen don't be that 10 that say we can't do this I can't get delivered I'm too filthy I've done too much in my life I'm too ungodly and you begin to sit in that corner and just remind yourself of what you used to do who you used to be and maybe all you need to do is seek Him amen amen amen friends this is ministering to me just as much as it is to you amen cuz I know what it's like to be hurt I know what it's like to be broken I know what it's like to be lost and I know what it's like to have things Stripped Away but we are well able amen we are well aable you don't have to be in that hurt any longer amen amen how about we all take take a trip together today let's all step out and take the land amen The Inheritance is yours amen amen it's yours the promise is yours the promise of the Holy Ghost is yours amen the promise of Salvation is yours amen amen the promise of Deliverance is yours amen the promise of healing is yours amen the doctor's reports you can you can leave the stack of doctor's reports brother brandham talks about that woman with the issue of blood for 12 years and showed us that she had stacks of doctor reports and she came to a place when she heard a man she heard of a man named Jesus amen and when she heard his name she stepped out amen she had been held up and just got out when she was going to doctor's reports and she heard about a man who can touch her she heard about a man that can save her she heard about a man that can deliver her she heard about a man that can take her lust she heard about a man and I'm saying this to say that when she stepped out he changed her story amen amen amen she didn't do it amen she just had to step out amen sometimes that's all we got to do we got to step out and we got to say God I mean business amen I need you like never before and when she steps out you know what she said she said if I could just touch she said if I could just Touch the Hem she didn't even have to touch him amen she had enough faith that if she could step out and just Touch the Hem of His Garment amen amen just this was enough to change her story amen amen just that was enough to deliver her amen just that was enough to save her just that was enough to to help her amen just that was enough to bless her just that was enough man maybe that's all we got to do amen if we got to have the Holy Ghost all we got to do is take a hold of His Garment am if we want to get some Deliverance all we got to do is take a hold of His Garment let's just take a hold of His Garment this morning the land is yours let's fight for it if you want a marriage fight for it if you want Deliverance fight for it if you want salvation you got to fight for it but how do you fight if you're if you're dwelling in your unbelief and how do you fight if you're sitting in your corner of unbelief and how do you fight if you're not going to get up and get out of that chair and get out of that hurt and get out of that Brokenness to step out he can't help you if you're not going to step out he can't help you if you don't want to make a move he can't help because it's up to you it's your choice amen amen it's your choice to step out if you want salvation it's your choice if you want healing it's your choice it's your choice it all comes down to what do you want do you want to walk with God or do you want to have a part-time relationship I'll only know him on a Sunday and I'll only know him on a Wednesday he wants to know you in a very personal and intimate way he wants to know you even more than what your wife wants to know you he wants to know you even more than what your girlfriend wants to know you he wants to know you so much closer amen he wants to have a deeper relationship with you he wants to have that same kind of unity that he used to have with Adam and Eve in the very beginning he wants to have that restored Fellowship he wants that which he used to have with you he wants that but we got to fight for it amen we got to stand up yes we got to take courage and stand up on the basis of Faith now brother brandham was saying would say in the power of [Music] decision he says now over in numbers the 13th chapter in the 30th verse we read this and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and then he would say may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word last evening the two or the last two evenings we've been teaching just a little short lesson or session of the book of Exodus the calling out of the people of God because we believe it is essential to this day brother brandwood then continue on to saying I remember there or I remember here a few years ago I was a year and six months in my church and teaching on the book of Exodus and I was two years one time one time on job and I remember I'd had job on the ash Heap for about four weeks every Sunday job on the ash Heap such a beautiful story it is it's a beautiful story such a beautiful story God dealing with his Saint and how that we get in those places and distress and don't know where to turn and I was working for a climax one dear sister bless her heart she didn't want to hurt my feelings said brother branam I enjoy every minute but where are you going to get job off the ash Heap oh my God brought him off all right to Victory amen amen amen amen friends so many times we s sit and we scrape our hurts and our Brokenness and we sit there and just I need to get this off it's not going to heal it you ever got a scab your body won't heal if you keep scraping it off amen it'll continue to bleed it'll continue to ooze it will continue to stay a scab and as long as you're doing this with your hurt and as long as you're doing this and saying I can't make it over to I can't have my healing and I can't have Del as long as we're doing this I do this too so I'm not I'm not I'm not shaming no one it's human nature we always struggle with ourself brother brandom said that your flesh cannot be converted but we got to take courage and stand up and go take the land amen amen now Joshua 1 and9 have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever let's let's look at that word withs soever wherever amen wherever you are amen he's with you always am he never leaves you amen withs soever thou goest amen he's with you always in the good and in the bad amen amen he's good with you or he's good to you in the good and in the bad he's with you always amen now the Bible would also tell us in Psalms 91 and one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of who the almighty the almighty who is God the one who's with you always the one who loves you always the one who never forsakes his own the one who will be with you in the good the one who cares about his own amen amen there's so many things that we could say about the love of God there's so many things that we could say about his Mercy there's so many things that we could say Through the Bible of how good he's been you know that song I will sing of the goodness of God man I I've always admired and I've always loved that song because it was all my life he's been there all my life he's seen me through all my life he's never lost me all my life when I was hurt myself when I was sitting in a depressed estate when I was sitting there with a suicidal Spirit he came down and saved my soul he came down and changed my direction he came down and set my feet on on

well be honest you know confession is good for the soul amen you know and we go to church and you know I I've been raised in church all my life but how many times I sat on a Pew knowing I wasn't living right but I would wear my jacket just right you know and I'm saying this to say that so many times we use our religion as a covering brother brandham taught that religion is just a covering and so many times we sit there and just pretend like everything's okay but we know deep down inside we got something wrong and we're scared about admitting it because we're worried what people might think we're worried what God would think but I'll tell you one thing God won't beat you over the head he loves you amen if you would be honest with God God and show him how honest you are by telling him what's wrong he already knows what's wrong so it's not any surprise to God Amen he just wants you to admit it amen that's when pride gets torn down amen we need to stop living in fear amen amen I'm going to leave you with this last scripture and we'll musicians just come on now the Bible says in Isaiah 41:10 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee

will sing of the goodness of God play that softly play that softly you know one time this came to my mind as we were singing it all my life you have been faithful you know I begin to think there's a story I heard one time about a young man who was raised in a church his mom and dad instilled it into him to come to church every Sunday about the age of 13 He Got rebellious it's common for a young man get rebellious and not want to go to church his dad was a he was in a wheelchair couldn't do much and this boy he got smart aliy to his mom one day said hey I'm not going to church she said you need to and he says no I'm not I don't want to go I don't want nothing to do with church so he didn't and while the mom and the dad went to church together the boy decided they lived in a very wintry Place unlike here but they lived next to a lake and at this Lake it was frozen and the boy decided he's going to grab some ice skates and he's going to go skate alone he goes out on the ice skating just letting out the anger that he had with his mom and in the perial vision of his eyes he sees two flags that would be shown on the ice if the ice is thin but by the time he saw the flag it was too late the boy fell through the ice yelling for help and no one's around begins to drown there happens to be a man walking by this Lake you might see where I'm going this man hears the faint Cry of a young man screaming help me help me I'm drowned help me I'm hurt help me and he begins to scream and this man who's walking his dog lets his dog who's a rescue dog goes and rescues the boy the man balances out his weight to get down to the boy on the ice pulls the boy out of the ice gets him dry takes him home dries him up gets him warm that boy then would say thank you sir for saving me and he went on his way years later this boy who's still out of church shoots a police officer kills him just because the police officer to move his told him to move his vehicle he said you want me to move this vehicle not happening reached inside the vehicle and grabbed a shotgun killed the cop goes to court about this case he's supposed to get life in prison the judge before he puts him away for life would ask him do you have any last words before I lock you up forever he said sir as I sit here in this chair I can't help but to remember [Music] you're that man that saved me at that Lake when I was drowning when I needed help you rescued me he said son I was your savior then today I'm your [Music] judge friends I want you to listen to what I'm saying [Music] he was your savior then tomorrow might be too late tomorrow you might it's not promised today tonight he might be your judge he might be my judge I don't know I might get killed in a car accident on the way home it's current it's right now that we need to make sure our life is ready if there's any with your brother I'm saying this under the word of the Lord amen if there's anything in your life that is not like him clean it out amen amen that boy went to prison served life in prison because he didn't heed to what his mom had taught him amen his mom taught him go to church if you serve the Lord he'll protect you always amen amen yes amen hallelujah amen but because he was disobedient because he was negligent because he was rebellious he had to serve life that man who once saved him was his judge friends we already know the prophet taught us that judgment starts right [Music] hereen friends I J I want to be ready amen I told Brother Henry a couple months ago I said brother Henry I said I don't care about
