every one of your children in jesus wonderful name we pray amen the book of acts the fourth chapter familiar scripture tonight it's just going to be simple and to the point hopefully the third chapter we understand that peter and john was going into the temple the gate called beautiful and found a man that was impotent amen acts in arms of them and they began to say unto them civil and gold have i none thank god that they had something that they could give them but it wasn't civil goal but such as we have we give them to thee they was able to give the man something i trust that that same god is in his people now praise god that they can do the same things that he did then praise god it's not just a god of history but he's a god that says i am amen and if he is and he he's your i am amen praise god you know what he resides such a hat as i have okay uh acts uh for i'll read the first you read the next we go down to the 12th verse and as they speak unto unto the people the priests and the captains of the temple and the saggy seeds came upon them too and they laid hands on them and put them in hold until the next day for it was now evening time for and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders inscribed six and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power are by what name have you done this if we be this day examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made hold ten this is the stone which was set at north of your builders which is become the head of the corner together neither is there salvation in any other for there is none of the name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved god bless you enjoyed you may be seated sometimes we want to ask the question what's in a name somebody said a good name is better to be chosen than gold a good name what's in a name we know that jacob amen wrestle with the angel and and he prevailed and he said your name would no more be called jacob which ildra shall be thy name because he was a prince with god he had power with god amen so you just can't i always tell young people don't just name your child one of these good african names or one of these good name to sound good but you got to notice something that's in the name are you with me because a lot of people you don't know where they what that what that name mean my wife was telling me you know she worked in the prison system and she was teaching in the prison she said you can almost even outside the prison when the people have a certain name they're almost headed to prison because you name them something you know and um and a lot of times people are going to go name their children without praying about it without trying to see what is a good name for a good name means but i want to talk about the name that's above every name amen we got we have many great prophets jeremiah isaiah moses abraham isaac jacob but he's he said here neither it is salvation in any other we had great church aids messages we had paul irenaeus and we you know we had different ones so he had you know luther and wesley and you know columbus and different ones you know we had uh you know we had william branham we had different ones amen but neither is that salvation in any other well there's none other name praise god we got to be certain that the the the name that we are interested in is the name of jesus the name that saves is the name of jesus amen somebody said well you did you miss my name your name is not important my name is not important but one thing if you can miss out and and forget my name you can forget so and so see they were telling jesus we got abraham for our father uh uh-huh you you we don't need you jesus we got abraham of our father are you greater than our father abraham isaac and jacob are you greater than our father to build this well the woman said and jesus was saying before abraham was i am are you with me so what happens amen paul says the people were in dispute that's just it shows you in corinthians here um how people got excited about a different message i mean different apostles and so forth and they were they were caught up in the in the name of oh you know um exalting one name above another are you with me and uh and that's what and paul had to straighten them out now this is what he said in first corinthians 1 and 10. my beseechu brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ are you with me i wish paul was here today and he could speak to the people of the church world today and i believe amen some church some people think because i'm a baptist then it's power in being the baptist some people said it's power and being the method it's just power and being the jehovah witness of jehovah is his name and some people you know they get caught up on but to us today neither is that salvation in any other amen some people want to say jesse or they want to you know they want to say that greek you know i mean the hebrew or whatever and they think you know but i i think god understands i think the name of jesus works i think amen you can say it in hebrew or whatever you want but i i said it works for me the name jesus worked for me praise god you know there was in spanish they might say jesus or jesus or whatever you know but the name jesus works amen so by the grace of god it is very important that you realize that [Music] it's important that you remember and exalt that name and it's no harm in using it when you need it amen when you're in trouble call on the name of the lord [Applause] amen you know what hallelujah if you want to be saved he said who said i shall call on the lord hallelujah whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved shall be delivered amen but people are ashamed to call in you know you don't hear people calling on the name of the lord like they used to amen it it's it's almost it it's kind of like uh you know it's not important anymore but it's you know i was thinking lord for the songs because he didn't know i don't i don't think he knew what i i feel pretty sure i didn't discuss it what i was going to preach and he even said there's power in the name of jesus so by the grace of god here here and here it is because i'm going to tell you something uh people want to say don't forget about uh uh uh the founding listen don't forget about that no they make sure they forget i'm gonna tell you something sometimes those things ain't important amen we need to look at the name of jesus and see how important he is are you up man oh lord amen it's almost like the the catholic church have all these statues one for mary one for the saints cecilia one for this and one for that you know what i'm saying and they lighten the count on you know lunas and praying to this one and praying for that one brother and sister let's remember that the name of jesus is still alive jesus is not dead but he's still alive amen jesus amen died that you can live and he rose again for your justification amen he let you know that i'm he that was dead but now i live and i'm alive forevermore praise god amen so we're not serving a dead god when we call on jesus he can he will amen he is able more than evil hallelujah you know when something happened to folk who really trusts trust in the law and believe that there's power in the name something happens you know they expect things to happen when the name of jesus is called amen with an honest heart somebody that got faith in the name praise god you got to have some faith in the name praise god hallelujah don't just call on me because paul called on him praise god don't be like the son of skevo amen praise god i'm gonna try to cast out devils amen because uh uh but you got to have something inside you all right that's right that's right you got to have something inside of you and because you don't have it in you and you go to try to imitate you try to call jesus and try to cast out the devil and the devils jump out and whip the people and beat them down the street strip their clothes off from random way naked are you with me and see what happens when people if you don't get a real relationship with god amen if you don't really get right with god and you calling on jesus says though jesus don't see amen the little stuff we do in secret are you with me but when you write with god amen he said the prayer of the righteous avail as much but we do all kind of stuff and we hide behind the name praise god and we hide behind you have a name that you live it and you're dead praise god amen but god amen he knows them that are his and he knows that everyone that name the name of christ he said let him depart from iniquity isn't that right for he said nevertheless the foundation of god stand in the shoe having this seal come on somebody amen the lord knows them that are healed he god amen oh lord you can't fool god you get real god know whether you're real or not but if you're trying to cover and hide and deceive god knows that too aren't you glad that god eyes and he can look amen see i find people want credit for what god's done men won't credit and people want you to give credit to the church they want you to give credit to the bishop or to this great man i'm giving credit to jesus jesus is the one that we need to give christ you know oh brother simmons nothing but you owe everything to christ you owe everything to jesus amen you owe them everything and and because we know amen how much we owed him i was telling them mullins last night about you know sometimes people do things expecting because god owed amen and i was saying that suddenly some folk think god owed them and some they they the church of all i did all i done and you know folk look at all i'm doing and nobody recognize what i've done you know it's a blessing that nobody recognize what you're doing you can do so much and nobody recognize but that's your greatest lesson because you didn't do it to get any praise and any glory for man amen but you did it because you know amen praise god god which is done in secret god would reward you openly are you with me you know that god ate hallelujah god i i only could do it because you gave me strength to do it i only could be a blessing because you blessed me to be a blessing amen i i couldn't give if you didn't give it to me praise god i couldn't do it if you oh hallelujah if you hadn't done it for me amen because you done it oh hallelujah hey god you when you get a gift your gift comes from god all good and perfect gifts come from above so whatever you got amen freely you have received freely give hallelujah don't charge oh lord they want people lord when you come in your king no grant one of my son said you're right and left he said it's not mine to kill it's already prepared before the foundation of the world who gonna sell on the right who gonna sell on the left are you with me so uh what god has for you it is for you nobody can take your position your place nobody could do it somebody took my place that wasn't your place all the time if it was your place nobody could take it are you with me because why god said touch not my anointing do my prophets no harm you know we can position replace ourselves and god has nothing to do with it we can establish ourselves i i i'm gonna say you can go 40 50 years even in in a ministry and god can raise up somebody overnight praise god and god can replace you like that amen god don't have no respect of any person god can use anybody anytime anywhere well god can do what he wants [Applause] are you a man so you know i used to hear the old elder he said we need god god don't need us but we shall need him amen and and and that and that's the problem we got to a place where people absorb zero in on themselves that the name of jesus is being left out of everything he said in colossians 3 and 17 and what so ever you do and what if you can't do it in the name of what in the name of the lord in the name of jesus don't do it at all you say you know people ask me a question brother simmons is all right for me to do this law i said can you would jesus do it would jesus do what you're doing sometimes the folk rely on jesus they say yeah jesus to do it it's okay so i know if you lie on jesus you rely on me because you know good one jesus wouldn't do what you do but some people some people are honest they say you gotta think on that i think jesus and see sometimes the company we keep we're wondering if jesus would be doing what you know sometimes the companionship and you know people be against the word and fighting the word and you are you know it's the name of jesus being glorified see that i'm talking about what's in a name see the name of j you're representing the name you are actually representing the name of jesus the whole family in heaven and earth is name you represent for paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ which is the power of god and the salvation to everyone to believe amen so what is you representing jesus christ when you go when you walk when you talk the way you live the way you conduct your life it's the name that's being exalted you got to realize that you got a name that's above every name amen thank god for the name of simmons and thank god for the name of this but that ain't the name that we want to shine we don't want the the name of league at the shine we don't know the name of simmons to sign the name upon we want the name of jesus to shine are you with me i thank god you know for your children for your wife you know you know but i don't want to exalt my wife i don't want to exalt my children i want to exalt jesus that's what you want you want jesus to shine amen praise god but sometimes we want we want to exalt and we want for human flesh to shine look at me look at me y'all see me come on i'm talking about exalting the name of jesus in the name of jesus praise god is the the name that should be exalted and you can't exalt jesus name without exalting his word amen and see if if if you abide in me and my word about you you can only place jesus in the word you know he and the word are one his name was called the word of god are you a so you take away though the word of god and then you try to exalt something outside the word it won't work and i find many people taking and saying that this is the name i'm exalting the name of jesus this is what the lord said this is what the law does the lord don't do stuff like that the lord is he's a humble god he's a compassionate and understanding god you know i told him last night when i read the romans 12 again to them i said the bible said don't render evil for evil bless them that persecute you bless them they curse you i said how many of y'all were doing that and they were honest they knew they knew better you know and that's the same thing the the the day the minute somebody said something we don't like we we we we blow off and ain't no blessing you ain't gonna invite them to dinner no more you ain't having nothing to do with them about a i heard they say something about me you could have heard a lie but you wanted to believe it i find many times a brother coming to me preaching brett simmons my wife and she is all upset because you're going around telling somebody people stuff about me i said huh pardon me who did i tell about you he said son someone i said never seen you don't know who you talking about i heard the name but i never seen it see what i'm saying see some folk can believe a lie and they can be pastors in the pulpit preaching the gospel and telling lies on you because where they get it from i don't even know they ain't gonna tell you are you up man folk hide behind lies you know what i'm saying but a lie cannot penetrate you unless you want to believe it that's right are you with me you only it's a door open in your spirit that you want to believe that brother so-and-so don't like you sister so-and-so is acting strange see it's a door open to you brother branham said you feel some kind of a funny feeling he said don't let the devil do that you go and get that straight now when you if you feel that way go get it straight i don't know don't let the devil do that oh no he said you just be sweet one towards another just love one another with all your heart don't let the devil slip in there you know i said shoot some kind somebody with some poison and then spread the pause and all over the church don't let that happen to y'all i know i gotta wait for myself but i get back down y'all hold it okay the devil has sprayed that paws and all over and he's he said you found out it wasn't nobody but the devil just shot something there and he said you follow that thing up it ain't no it ain't nothing but the devil it wasn't nobody it was the devil trying to start something are you with me but you gotta you know sometimes you have to hey what is this true or not what what see sometimes people told us out of it you know what i'm saying and you say why what they say out of it praise god you know somebody can step on your foot and don't even know they stepped on your foot when they step right on my foot ain't meant to step on it then they sound excuse me i'm sorry come on somebody you know where folks are actually getting their head chopped off folks are nowadays being persecuted again because they're christians folks are actually uh dying because they can't get a a a a a spoon just a mouth of food you know what i'm saying folk eating like the garbage can and you're worrying about lord have mercy you know i think god would be so upset with us nowadays the thing that we let get in front of us and god that the name of jesus is not shining like an altar and being glorified amen children look teenagers are shooting themselves you know they said the school is in them i have it you go to school and the children just they're taking over the teachers don't know what to do they're quitting left and right because the children go wow you know what i'm saying all these problems and all the conditions the earth is quaking homosexuality taking over everywhere you know people are in bad shape why do we ought to be standing in the gap making up the hedge and crying because of the abomination done in the city while we need to be lifting up the name of jesus are you with me see that's that's what we're supposed to be hey these children lord is it going can the world stand it much longer lord we need to be praying and god help lord jesus you can fix it god you can change things oh god help your people lord oh who gonna cry if you don't start crying out if we don't do it who gonna do it i'm talking about the name of jesus is it important okay he says let me go he says the 12th verse i just skipped over it said 12th verse 1 and 12. this i say that every one of you say i'm a what and i'm a what polis and i are what and uh what christ it's christ what what's paul what see that's what the key is it doesn't matter how great a a person's ministry how much god uses an individual it comes down to who was crucified for you who died for your sins are you with me who was crucified for you thank god for god you you know sometimes people say well jesus died for me i don't set out to disrespect you know we don't want to disrespect god's servant for the this island and what god has done for us for the message of the hour and we don't want to disrespect the fireform ministry the evangelists the pastors the prophet the teachers we don't want to disrespect them but we want to keep everybody in their place are you with me see people use you know they can use the scripture nobody died for me but jesus that's who i ah that's who i listen to jesus praise god you know they're big and bad i don't know nobody jesus you might want to go on in the wilderness and be by yourself look gone in the wilderness and be by yourself because you don't need nobody but jesus are you with me but we got to be humble enough to say we need one another this is one body in many members and we need one another you need a pastor don't care if you're a prophet or pastor whatever you need a pastor somebody gonna straighten you out somebody got to give a count for you watch for your soul i'm a manager i talk directly to me yeah talk to you if he talking to you tell you you need a pastor and what happens is we've gotten so loose in this age here they're loose in the schoolhouse the political system is just wild everything is just loose nobody won't head ship want nobody no oh no this is that layout of the seal means people what i got a right to do what i want and that's what they're doing exactly what they want and nobody's going to tell them nothing if it's anywhere that we can get directed by the holy spirit and get in harmony and in union with god is that we come on the headship of the holy ghost and when the holy ghost speak then we ought to all recognize this is the holy ghost are you with me and the holy ghost bear witness with the with the word amen and if it's the holy ghost we can take it back to and if we take it back to the word then we know we got in the right place are you with me but if we say i got the holy ghost and the holy ghost told me to do this the holy ghost told you to do that and the bible said you speak the same thing and there be no one are you with me and the only way we gonna do that each local church each local assembly got to come on one accord you can't have headship i'm listening to this voice up here in new york and i'm listening to this voice and over here and so on and so on and that's not your hair chip you can listen and enjoy that but at the same time you got to realize amen am i really taking heed to what the spirit trying to say to me locally and what am i doing to enhance and what am i doing to unify the church and to bring it to the place that we would desire to see god move among us are you with me i want to see god move in a special way i want to see the power of god i want to see when people walk in here amen that there's a hey god that's a holy ghost power there's a power distracts praise god that's a power of conviction praise god something that's like oh god i want to see that praise god when the fire began to strike each and every individual praise god the fire began to burn in the children and children got the flying in them praise god the growing ups got the fire in them praise god hallelujah then the devil can't stand the fire praise god hallelujah oh yes the fire can't be hatred and meanness and all it's got to be perfect law it's got to be putting up with your faults and you putting up with my faults and we putting up with one another we forgiving one another loving one another caring about one another amen then the fire is burning but it's holy fire praise god hallelujah it's a holy fire amen it's the it's the anointing of the holy ghost that's keeping the church clean amen praise god sin can't stay within your gates amen the center can't stand in the congregation of the righteous are you with me why because you're not allowing that that's my friend that's my buddy i love you but i want you to repent that's right praise god oh wow they doing don't do it come on somebody don't we want god i want i know each and every one of us want all of our family saved amen you want your next door neighbors saying you want your name you know you pray for your neighbors sometimes oh lord you can see some ungodly stuff going on in your neighborhood and he said lord you know i'ma tell you something you can go out there and bring some folk to church but you better see about them that's right folks i'm bringing someone someone you gotta hold on to your pocketbook type you can bring something in the garden ain't tell you to bring in and you're going to be careful you know the lord taught me a long time ago he said he said whosoever will let him come but you know some folk what they do they take and twist somebody on put their hand behind the back and jack them up make them come but i tell you what when they get here you're gonna have something on your hand trying to get them out you can say you know you ever let somebody in your house and you couldn't get them out he said lord i try to be nice to them and i allow them to come in right it's time for them to go and you look they say i'm going next week next week come i'm going next week next week i'm going tomorrow demarco um see what i'm saying you let i'm going to tell you something see god and the holy spirit already told you don't do that don't do that you say well i got you know i got the love of god and i gotta see sometimes you gotta listen to god sometimes let me see what i read i hope i got it okay the prophet god says he says no matter how much is needed or how much everybody agree that it is needed and how much that it is truth there is yet one thing to find out is that the will of god is that the will of god see this is see sometimes we can do a thing and we thinking that we're doing the will of god and the prophet said you're trying to do god a service without it being his will you can try to do something for god that god did not attain i was talking to a minister today i said you know he's been out there i'm pretty big with some big people and all he said he's a brother simmons you know i don't desire all of these big great things out here you see i've been working he said but i don't need that all see i just want to be simple just want to be simple i said you know something i had respect for that brother and i can feel it coming from his heart so i ain't worried about that he said if i can only be a blessing to the local church if i can only be a blessing to the local assembly he said that's all that's what i teach that's what i preach how can i be a blessing to the locals assembly you see that's what i i said brother it ain't many like you they got the ability that you got but yet that they can that can be great or somebody way up there but choose not there ain't many people like that that has the opportunity to be way up there and great and yet they choose not i'm saying to you if you get up there it's the name of jesus are you getting up there to you know i you can use excuse lord i'm doing it in your name i want your name but it ah god says dandy see i'm gonna tell you when god does it when god puts you somewhere you don't even know it [Applause] you know you there and you don't even know you're there it just happened but when you got to what to get there you got to manipulate maneuver and try to get there because this is me i'm great god gave me this to give to the world god don't need that what we want to see is jesus the name of jesus praise god it doesn't matter how gifted we are how blessed we think we are god don't need it tell you something the people that god really uses and blesses is the people that not out it's not the world renown it's not many of them a call god calls the nobodies of the earth and he makes them somebody but they'll never be recognized by the world the world love the world love what praise god so if the word love is only then you're not of this are you with me so why you want to be recognized by them we're striving for something that god don't want us to have are you with me i keep saying it over and over again god promised to supply all of our needs according to his riches and glory what we want god to supply all of our wounds what we want we don't need and what we need we don't want are y'all with me i said what we need we don't want and what we want we don't need are you with me but oh yes huh i'm gonna get it i'm gonna get what i and that's why i said last night god will give you the desire of your god to let you walk in permission will instead of walking in perfect will because why you won't listen to him and even though god might save you but you're going to go through something you're going to pay something for disobedience praise god god gonna correct you but you might not want to take the correction down the road you're gonna realize that god gonna straighten you out because he knows them that he is and he ain't gonna let you just one one one but he gonna let you get learn your what listen learn your lesson amen and god god knows how to humble us now and whatever it takes for him to humble us down god will let it come amen how many you ever gotta have a give a good spiritual weapon y'all ever been you had a good spiritual weapon if you ain't never had a spiritual weapon you just sat in that line because god again and i'm talking about it he said well i have one oh lord you must have just got saved yesterday because when you own this journey you're going to have many spiritual weapons because many times the holy spirit don't give that little nudge and say don't and you don't say you know i heard but maybe maybe not just maybe maybe maybe it wasn't he wasn't saying now maybe he talked about later so i i believe uh you know how we want to do something and we we really don't want yeah you mean don't right now yeah you know what he's saying all the time but we want to hesitate and like i didn't hear that i didn't hear that voice i i i don't know i just think it out loud that's just me no that was god telling you don't he was giving you that little nudge telling you don't do that and you you you you talking back you're talking about who you talking to them you know you said well i ain't i didn't talk i ain't saying no words but you was talking you're holding a conversation they open your mouth holding a conversation in your head are you with me how many of you ever did that see a lot of times you have a conversation going on and god trying to get you going the right way and you will still go the wrong way because you were y'all said it i didn't somebody said you hard-hitted and you know what glory i heard my mama say something i ain't gonna say it in the pulpit tonight hardhead [Laughter] [Music] that's the old time you're saying i got to stop i just got all the way off my subject tonight yo yo y'all be good here y'all be good because god is good to us y'all do everything you can do to make god i'm gonna say like let's make god proud of you make god glad make him happy that he died for you he said for the joy that was set before him he endured across you his joy you the joy that he saw amen and you make god lord i appreciate what you did for me keep your eyes on the pride keep your eyes on the cross say lord i thank you for what you've done for me you know he died for the whole world but everybody don't appreciate what he done but you do you you really appreciate that he died for you amen and you're going to hold that name of jesus precious that name of jesus when the devil come up against you say in the name of jesus get behind me satan in the name of jesus christ come out devil how come you think uh the lord listened to brother simmons and not listen to you see sometimes you don't need to every time uh something uh sickness or something that happened to you well the bible said call for the elders of the church some of y'all take the elder as being the title are you with me but he said the elder women teach you what they not elders in the church but they're not a part of the five-fold ministry but the elder if you've been saved long enough you ought to be an elder you know ought not to be a bathe are you with me but you ought to grow up and be matured you know right he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they sh are you a believer so believers do what they cast out davos you know it's halloween the carving of the pumpkin and all of that is supposed to have been what witches did and and all of that bro gerard did i give you one of those no i gave it to brother chappelle one of my halloween things and y'all want one i'll give y'all a copy about halloween it's this is for the druids and the witches huh yeah and uh and that's what they do they usually sacrifice children on the on that time and so that's what it's all about and i'm saying to you don't get caught up on halloween you know get caught up on jesus christ this thing is late in the evening sun going down and you're not supposed to be ignorant of certain devices are you with me so they were doing a lot of bad stuff back then and it's still the richest day you know they still do the stuff right now on halloween i never told y'all about the two ladies it was converted from witchcraft and they own the bible bookstore and they tell me about a lot of the missing children they told me about that way back when i was a young preacher see a lot of the missing children they were offered up for sacrifices are you with me and they said the lord delivered them out of witchcraft heavy the material and the books that he should give me on faith and stuff like that i mean you can't buy them no more all the mom and pop stores that really identified all of these things that be happening you can't get that material no more the preachers used to preach against sin and stuff like that that they can't they can't come on television no more why the devil instead some of those big preachers got trapped by the devil and fell into sin and once they fell into sin they lost the nation so the nation don't because a lot of people had their eyes on the big preachers i'ma tell you something god won't give his glory to another so god will let man fall because he wants you to look to him even the prophet said the lord had to take me off the scene because the people had started worshipping him he said god has to take me because the people are worshiping me you see y'all caught causing me to be an antichrist y'all people y'all love me y'all good people but y'all causing me to be an antichrist he said don't do that i wonder what he'll say today if he was around i told those people not to do it you think they stop never came to get one brother tommy the point of the prophet said that's my god i said huh the man dead he's not my god i'm gonna tell you things happen brother sister friends you're gonna have to know jesus christ for yourself amen i tell each and every one of us has to have our own personal relationship with jesus christ you can't the voice that you need to be listening to is the voice of jesus christ and he is the word any other voice you gotta cast down any other voice oh that's my friend that's people that close to you can get in your ear sometime and you'll never see them until they're too close to you the same you get too close to the mirror you won't even see your face because you're too close to it i'm gonna tell you something sometimes you have to back up and take a look at yourself take a look at yourself through the word and see where you stand with god am i closer to god than i was last year we coming to the end of this year am i closer am i further away god bless you let's get closer to god how you going to get closer to god by this man that know that you're my disciples because you were the love got to be so great it can't be it can't be something we can talk about something that we know is there it's free it's just there hallelujah i know it's got quiet but your love for god once you love god you gotta worry about loving others because it's just gonna flow from you that love amen you couldn't somebody says i remember being a another minister was like brothers he he had so much caring i said man kill a hand he said i don't care that it'll be all right i said kill those ants you want to kill a fly you don't want to kill a mosquito you know you know you know he got so much guard in him you don't kill nothing i said thank you that thing answers in the draw hands in your everywhere i said i told you ants everywhere he never had to kill those ants didn't he see what i'm saying sometimes we can get too holy you know we can get so holy and you know in the wrong respect you know the answer take over sometimes so we got to direct our faith in a different way we can love god and have so much love for god but you know sometimes we the mosquitoes that bite you it's all right [Music] they going smack him isn't that right okay god bless you let us stand don't wait till the ants then got it all over your car all over your house in your shoes and everywhere pants and then you just wake up saying maybe you know maybe i supposed to kill that hand now i'm talking about ants the thing sometimes is things that we don't want to tackle because of the love that we have for god so we want to see everything just live and everything you know just to go be do his thing but sometimes it's some things that we have to tend to in our lives in order for us to have the peace and the liberty that god wants you and i to have some things you have to handle that god said i want you to take care of this in your life something we don't want to mess with but god said i want you to handle these things because if you don't these things going to be a pest to you are you with me these things that you need those ants little small ants things that you need to take care of little ants it's the little foxes that spoil the fire it's a little lemon the levinson are you with me it's the little things in your life that you need to see about it ain't all right you need to go and see about those little things because those little things become big things they grow up handle the little things now before they become so big that you have trouble getting rid of it are you with me let us spout father in jesus name lord said neither says salvation in any other for there's no other name given among men under heaven whereby we must be saved you say that the name of jesus every knee shall bomb every tongue should confess to jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father father you said if
