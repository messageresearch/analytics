Oh God, you're more than able to supply all of the needs according to your riches and glory. We believe that Lord, and that's what we're standing on here today, God, that you would comfort hearts, oh God. Oh Lord, that you would give peace, Lord.

Little something we've been ministering on. Kind of been in the same area for a little while, but you know, God is good. Amen. Always gives you a word for the season. Amen. That's what we always depend on, right? A word for the season. Because we know that if God gives us a word for the season, come on. It'll be a blessing to your soul, won't it? To those that receive it now. Amen. You believe that this morning? The book of Matthew by the grace of God. Matthew 7 and and we'll begin at the at the 13th verse. Let's let's we'll begin here at the Yeah. the 13th verse. We got it. Say amen. Amen. And it reads, "Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadth to destruction, and many there be which go there in there at. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadth unto eternal life, and few there be that what? Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep clothing, but inwardly they are revenanting wolves. Ye shall know them by their what? fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is heuned down and cast into the fire, whereby their fruits sh ye shall know them. Not every man that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth what? The will of my father which is in heaven. You may be seated. I'm going to read a little further down. He says, "Not everyone that says Lord, Lord." Right? He says, "But you got to do the will." Right? Come on. Because there's a lot that say Lord, Lord, but they don't do the will. Amen. But he said to them that do the will, right? my father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many many wonderful works. Then I then will I profess unto them I never knew ye. Depart from me ye that work in iniquity. Therefore whosoever heareth these things of mine and do what? Doeth them. Amen. I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock. And when the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. And everyone that heareth these things of mine, if doing them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand. And the rains descended, and the floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon the house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes. May God had a blessed reading of his word. this morning just for a moment I want to talk to you on on the quiet before the storm. Amen. Or we want to talk about the oncoming storm. Amen. Come on. The oncoming storm. It's evident in each and every one of our lives that storms are come. Right? Many times people want to live this life but they don't want to go through nothing. Right? And that's and that's the way of every human being. You don't want to say I want to go through something. Right? But it's evident that the storms will come in your life, right? But the storms that come in your life, they're coming to try. Let's say this morning, they're coming to try what you built on. Right? Come on. But if you built right, then the storms that come won't knock you out, will they? But when you ain't built right, that's when you're going to have all the trouble in life. Right? You're going to have trouble when the house ain't built right. Right? So no matter you know sitting here today we find that many of people go to church right many of people profess God and say Lord Lord right but everybody ain't doing the will of God right many people building houses but that don't mean their house built right right sometimes you might get a contractor or something to come build a house and you might say I'm experienced I know what I'm doing I've been doing it for 20 years right but he could have been doing it for 20 years in the wrong way Right. And it just so happened that the right storm ain't come yet. But when the right storm come, it's going to try that house, right? And all the houses that he built, ain't it? Come on. Oh, Jesus. But when the house is built, right? Right. No matter what storm come, tornado, whatever come, hurricanes, right? When it's all over, hallelujah, that house will still be standing, won't it? Oh Jesus. I thank God this morning that when it's all over, Hallelujah. nothing going to stand but what? The word of God. Hallelujah. So, I'm asking you this morning, what are you building your house on? Come on. Are you building it on a church? Come on. Are you building on something somebody told you? Right? Are you building it on mama or daddy experience? What is your house built on this morning? Because it is only one thing that's going to stand and that's what the word of God. How many believe that this morning? Why? Because it's a rock, ain't it? Oh Jesus. A lot of times you building. You building this morning. Whether you think about it or not, you building, right? Jesus said, "The ones that hear his word and do it, they building, right?" And he says they building on a what? On a rock. Hallelujah. He says, "But the ones that hears my word and don't do it, they building, ain't they?" But what are they building on? Sand. Ain't it? Come on. But when the storm come, hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And that's what it is. You know, Jesus talked about that that storm, right? Storms that's going to come in lives, right? Oh jeez. I like that's why I like that they were saying saying he moved so many mountains out of my way, right? And I'm going to go a little further and say, not only has he moved many mountains out of my way, but he called a peace to so many storms in my way. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. You know, out there, somebody says, "I've been in a storm too long." Hallelujah. But don't you know it's one that can call a peace to the storm. Come on. It's one that can make the storm cease. You don't have to be in that storm no more. Hallelujah. Go wake Jesus up. Come on. Oh God. Hallelujah. But we find that I says that you know what what it builds on depicts right of what's going to happen. You find many of times come on. And and I said it the other week that you'll find many people that's been been Christians. Sometimes they be preachers, right? They walk with the Lord for many, many years, right? But when the storm come, it just look like they don't know what to do, right? Look like they come to the end and and they don't know how to get a breakthrough, right? They might have said, "I preached it so many years and and told people about it, but I don't even know how to get a breakthrough myself." Right? Because it comes a time when there's no more pretending. Right? Come a time when you got to know that he's real. Come on. You come to those places in life where you say, "Lord, if you don't help me, I'll die right here." Come on. Come to those places in life where your enemies is going to meet you and you say, "God, I can't let you go." Hallelujah. Until you bless me, I need something from you. I can't just keep going in and coming out, but God, I need something real in my life. I need you to show yourself alive and well by many infallible proofs. Come on. Oh, Jesus. We meet those places in life, don't we? Come on. I don't know if I'm talking to somebody that met those places before. Hallelujah. Somebody that been in that storm. Hallelujah. And they know that if God didn't intervene, hallelujah, then they didn't know what was going to happen, but they prayed long enough. Hallelujah. They stayed on their knees long enough. Come on. And God showed up. Come on. And then their testimony is if he showed up then, he'll show up now. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, if he did it once, he'll do it again. Oh God, don't you thank God for that? Hallelujah. That's what those testimonies, those storms, Jesus talked about the wind blowing, right? Come on. The wind is just one part of the storm, ain't it? Come on. Some people house can't stand the wind, can it? But then the rains come, right? Come on. The rain sometime don't let up. Hallelujah. But it keep raining, right? Then all of a sudden the flood come, right? And then the flood. But one going to knock you out, right? But it don't matter when you built right. Hallelujah. Come on. When you when you got saved right from the beginning, right? It wasn't just a fly by day or night, but it was something that happened down in your soul. Hallelujah. It was something that reached you. Come on. That it was more than just I just jumped, I just shouted, I just uh uh spoke in tongues, but it was something that happened down in my soul. Hallelujah. that when I don't feel like he near, something in my soul tells me he'll never leave me nor forsake me. Something in my soul's telling me everything is going to be all right. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on. But it's got to be down in your soul, right? Come on. I was telling the testimony, you know, the other week about how, you know, how deadly those tornadoes are. Come on. They pretty bad, right? You say that. I was saying the other week, you know, out there in the Midwest and how those tornadoes, they come out of nowhere, right? Soon as the dark clouds start coming, everybody afraid. They looking to see if they see that tail. That's what we used to call, that tail coming out the sky, right? Because you don't know. They unpredictable most of the time, right? And they'll come up so fast. Sometimes you'll see them go in a neighborhood and tear up one or two houses and don't mess with nobody else house. Sometimes they'll go hit. They unpredictable, right? You can't determine the path of it, right? But it's one thing about it I know. Hallelujah. That I might not be able to determine the path, but I know who's the maker of the winds. Hallelujah. Who's the creator of the rains? He can direct that, can't he? Come on. And whatever he allowed. Hallelujah. That I'm fine with it. Right. But I know one thing. It might shake. It might blow. It might tear up. But one thing, it can't uproot. That's the word down in my soul. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. But those those tornadoes, they pretty dangerous, ain't they? We talking about storms this morning, right? Come on. They pretty dangerous. And I know out there in the Midwest, a lot of times the people say that, you know, I'd rather live in a tornado than a earthquake, earthquake or a hurricane, right? Because they never had to experience it before. Many of us that experienced hurricane said we'd rather have them than the tornadoes or the earthquakes cuz at least the weather man can tell us that they coming, right? And we can prepare for them. Then those that are out west say I'd rather have a earthquake, right? Then the tornado does because they never experienced certain things. But now we're living in an hour where we experiencing all three. Amen. You don't know whether the earthquake coming tomorrow. You don't know whether tornado gonna hit today. You don't know when the hurricane is coming. We're experiencing all three. Hallelujah. But you know I know one wind. Hallelujah. That's greater than all the tornadoes. One wind that can turn every hurricane. One rock that can hold through every earthquake. And that's the word of God. Hallelujah. And that's what I'm resting in. Let it shake. Let it blow. Hallelujah. My trust is in who? God. Hallelujah. Is that what your trust is in this morning? Come on. The storm. Come on. I know that. I said that. What it is many things times in our lives. Come on. We've been talking about storms. Why? Because the world is experiencing a storm today, ain't it? They calling for peace, but they don't know when the bombs going to start falling, right? Somebody told me the president was talking to Russia yesterday and then all of a sudden after that, while he was on the phone with him, whole bunch of bombs hit Ukraine. Come on. Don't know. You can't trust nobody, right? Man's word ain't his bond no more, is it? Come on. He tell you something, he'll lie to you. Right? But it's only one that we can trust. It's only one that ain't going to lie to you. Hallelujah. It's only one that's going to give you the truth upon the truth. Hallelujah. It's only one that when he make you a promise, he'll keep that promise, won't he? Come on. He'll do just what he said. He ain't never fail yet. Never will he fail. Come on. That's where my trust in. Oh, men are liars. Come on. But God's word is true. Come on. Do you believe that this morning? Come on. Don't let me be excited by myself this morning. Come on. God is good, ain't it? Come on. But the storm. Hallelujah. Come on. I I says that many of times, you know, uh uh the way it ends up in your life, right? It ain't had to end up that way, right? Many of times is the storm hit and it's way worse on people than it should have been. Why? Because they weren't prepared for it, right? And it wasn't that they they they didn't have the the the the the will to prepare for it. They just let that little thing called procrastination come in. Right. Little spirit come in here. I might have a little bit more time. Right. Come on. But those storms now. We looking in natural, but we talking spiritual as well. Come on. They coming up so fast. You ain't got time to prepare. Right. You say the sun was just shining. Where' those clouds come from? Look on the radar. ain't even sure you're on the radar. They just forming out of nowhere, right? But to the man that's prepared for the storm. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Might come today, might come tomorrow. Nevertheless, I'm trusting in God. Hallelujah. Nevertheless, I'm trusting in the right shelter. Come on. Oh Jesus. My shelter is in God. I don't have to be feared with the bombs that's falling. I don't have to be feared with the war that's breaking out because I know one thing. He'll keep me. He'll hold me in his hands. Come on. How many believe that this morning? Oh Jesus. Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Come on. He'll hold you this morning. That says what it is. Those storms come so rapidly, don't they? Come on. They come in way. You know, I always say, well, we looking at in the natural, it's a spiritual application to it, ain't it? Come on. The world today worried about the wars and all that, but look at all the natural disasters they can't do nothing with. And they'll tell you their self, if this happen, we ain't ready for it. Hallelujah. Well, if you know that this could happen, then why you ain't getting ready? That's the problem, right? I mean, that's the question. Why ain't you getting ready? Right? Come on. Why ain't you? You know that the bridegroom could call you at any time, right? Why don't you have enough all? But that thing is people think maybe he might not come tonight. I'll wait till in the morning, right? But in midnight the cry was made. Right? At the time you didn't think. That's why he said you need to watch as well as what? Pray. Hallelujah. Cuz you don't know the hour that the Lord will come. Right? He'll come when you think he ain't going to come. Right? He'll come when you think that you that you that you ain't ready and all those things. That's when he'll come. But the thing is when you're ready. Hallelujah. He can come at any time. Right. God, I'm ready. Not just cuz I think I'm ready, but I'm on my knees. Hallelujah. And I'm crying out, God. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on. But I say one thing about it. You know that that they ain't have to happen if people was ready for Right. Come on. You know, I was thinking about Job. Job had some storms, didn't he? Come on. In the storms, maybe he didn't think the storms was going to come. He might have had that further away from his mind. But one thing about Job, he was ready, wasn't he? Come on. He went out, went on ahead and make his sacrifices, right? Man, my children ain't did nothing yet, but perav do something, right? Come on. I don't see no clouds gathering, but Lord, if the clouds do start gathering, right? I want to already have my sacrifices made. Come on. I want to already be ready for when the storm is coming. Right. So, I know that it might not look like nothing right now, but if it come now, I want to be ready. Hallelujah. I'm going to make my sacrifice. Perventure. Come on. Oh Jesus. And while he was sitting there, it looked like everything was calm. All of a sudden, the storm came out of nowhere, didn't it? Come on. Oh Jesus. All of a sudden, he lost all this. He lost all that. Right. Before but before the wind stopped blowing, somebody come tell him the rain falling. Right before the rain stopped falling, somebody come in the dark, the floods is coming. Come on, just paraphrasing it. Before they quit talking about the floods coming, somebody come in the door. Earthquakes hitting, right? Oh, Jesus. Before they get done with that, sometimes you say, "Lord, when is it going to stop?" Come on. But Job thing was, hallelujah. Naked I came and naked I leave. Blessed be the name of what? God. Hallelujah. He give and he take away. I'm ready for the storm. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. Hallelujah. He was ready, wasn't he? Come on. But one thing about it, you know why he could be ready? You know why those things couldn't shake him? Because that ain't where his confidence was, right? Come on. His confidence wasn't in the money that he had, was it? His confidence wasn't in the the insurance he had on the house, right? Oh, Jesus. His confidence wasn't in all his friends and all that, right? His confidence wasn't even in his health, was it? Come on. His confidence wasn't even in his wife, was it? Wasn't even in his children. But where was his confidence at? Come on. That I know that my what? My redeemer live. Come on. And in the last day, he'll stand on the earth. Hallelujah. Though the skin worms eat my flesh. Oh, it might get bad, but he'll call my name one day. And I'll answer the call. Hallelujah. I'll hear them. I'll stand again. Come on. I'll smile again. I'll Oh, Jesus. Come on. My joy is coming back. Come on. Oh Jesus. Come on. Do you believe God like that this morning? Come on. But it's true, right? It's true. Come on. Those storms come so fast, don't they? Come on. You might see, hey, I thought they were doing good today. They gone tomorrow. Come on. Storm come super fast, don't it? Oh, I got a little bit tired. Can wait. Come on. Tomorrow sickness hit, right? Tomorrow they give you a a call. Only happened to me twice. Call you on the job. Hey, we got to give you a furlow papers. Came from out of nowhere. Came super fast. Right. Come on. Say, "Were you prepared?" I know one thing. God's got it all in his hands. Hallelujah. Come on. I know who my provider is. Right. See, I wouldn't be prepared if my confidence was in those things. But I feel like Job. Though he slay me yet, I'll trust him. Though he take everything away yet, I'll trust him. Though this might happen all friends turn away, I'm going still trust God. I'm going stand in the word of God and believe that all things work together for the good of them that love God. Come on. Oh Jesus. And I believe that. Do you believe that this morning? Come on. But it's the truth, ain't it? Come on. God has been so good to us, ain't it? You know one thing about it? One thing about God, he calls us, don't he? Come on. And he can quit calling. He only obligated to call you one time. Come on. But what he is, he's longsuffering, ain't he? Come on. He's waiting on somebody to get ready, ain't it? He's waiting on because the devil, he want to he want to knock you out, but God is waiting on somebody to get prepared, right? The the word is going out. What it is? The word is going out. That's why he says you hear my word. Not only to hear it, but you got to do it, right? You got to live it. Come on. It'll be many people that heard the word. Come on. Many people that smoke in tongues. Many people that shouted, many people that did great works, right? But he said, "On that day I say, do what? Depart from you. Ye that work iniquity. I never what? Knew you." So you can't rest on the signs and the wonders, right? But what do they do? They follow those that believe. But what you got to rest in? Hallelujah. As I'm resting in the word of God. Hallelujah. That God, what you said, that's what I'm standing on. It might have hurt my flesh, but God, it might have got it might have wasn't what I wanted to do. Hallelujah. Might get went against what my will was. But I was willing to lay it down. Come on. Because I wanted your will. Is that what you want this morning? Come on now. Jesus showed us that. Come on. That when the storms come, he showed us how to weather the storm, right? Oh, Jesus. You know, I was praying. I was thinking about Jesus and and how when he was at his darkest hour. Come on. But Jesus was praying, wasn't he? And he was saying, "If it be possible, come on. This storm that's coming." Oh Jesus. The wind, the forecast, they telling me how bad it's going to be. Come on. It's going to be a car category five. Come on. A EF5 or whatever they call it. It's going to be a a 10 on the record scale. That's what they predict. And God, if it's your will, let this cup pass. Right. Come on. This storm, I don't know if I'm going to be able to bear it, right? But what did Jesus say? But Lord, not my what? Will, but let thy will be done. Right? Because if you put this storm on me, come on. Then I know that you'll give me strength to make it through it. Hallelujah. It might not look like nothing going to be left when it's over with. Oh Jesus. But the rock will still be there. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. When it's all over, the rock still going to be there. Oh Jesus. And if you were anchored to the rock, oh God, come on. They say everything else shook, blowed all around you, but you were still standing. How were you still standing? Why do you still got peace? Don't you know everybody else has given up? Come on. Everybody else has walked away. People don't go to church no more. Come on. How are you still standing? Oh Jesus. Because I'm tied to the rock. Come on. I don't know. But it's something that keep holding me. Oh Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus. Come on. I would have let go long time ago. But the rock hallelujah. That I'm tied to. Oh Jesus. Wouldn't let me go. Aren't you glad for that this morning? Come on. Sometimes I don't know about you, but I think about some of the storms. Hallelujah. I think about some of the things that God has brought me through. Hallelujah. And then when you start going through, I said, "God, now no matter what, you brought me through this." Hallelujah. And you brought me through that. Come on. If you if I made it through all that, I know that you're able to keep me. I don't believe you brought me this far to leave me, God. So what may come tomorrow, I'mma hold on. I'mma hold out. I'mma wait on you. Come on. I said, "Are you waiting on God this morning?" Come on now. It's true. This is coming reality. Come on. This is coming reality. Come on. Some people make it through the the storm, the wind, and the rain, but they can't last the flood, right? Come on. Oh, Jesus. I want to ask you a question. You think God brought you this far to leave you? Come on. You think God brought you this far to leave you? Come on. I don't know about you, but I feel that I come too far to turn around now. Amen. Come on. After all the goodness that God has shown toward us and all the mercy and the kindness that God has showed towards us when we didn't even deserve it, right? Could have destroyed a long time ago. But his longsuffering, right? His mercy, his love, his see his love goes beyond what we can think. Beyond what man's mom and dad, his love goes way beyond that, don't it? Come on. His mercy stretches way beyond what we can think, right? But people don't understand. They think that God don't like them or something. Think that God hated them. Come on. Think that God won't hold something good from them. But if they only knew, hallelujah. In the midnight hour, if they only knew, come on. The protection that God has allowed it for them. Oh, they treat God a little bit different. How many believe that this morning? They shout the house down, wouldn't they? They'd always have a testimony, a song in their heart. Come on. Because God has opened their eyes to it. Amen. Somebody give the Lord a hand clap this morning. Oh Jesus. Come on. I said the storm. I asked the question this morning. I said, "Are you ready for the storm?" Come on. Are you ready for it? Come on. What a blessing it is to be prepared. Right. Come on. I've seen it. I said a lot of times people walk with God for a long time, but when major storm come, they don't know what to do. Right? Come on. Then they start doubting, don't they? I wonder is he real or not? Come on. Then they look back at their experiences and they start doubting their experiences, right? Come on. Because it looks like everything quiet, right? We call on God. Look like he didn't show up. Come on. But those storms are there to do what? Try you, ain't it? Come on. Each trial is doing something in your life, ain't it? Amen. He said, "I brought nothing in this world. Neither can I take nothing out." But you'll take one thing out and that's your character. Right? You'll be different than you was than when you came in. Right? When I came in, I might have been a weak little thing, right? Oh, God. Needed somebody to hold my hand. Might have been through been this kind of way that where I couldn't even do nothing without God, right? And I still can't do nothing without God. But the more that I grew, hallelujah, and the more that I've been through, then I start to realize, hallelujah, that my footsteps are ordered by the Lord, right? that whatever he takes me through, that's why the devil get mad with you. Hallelujah. Because no matter what, he can't take the smile off your face. He can't take the joy out your heart. Why? Because he didn't give it to you. Neither can he take it away. He might say, "I attacked their children. I attacked their family. I attacked their friends. I hit their health." But yet they still praising you. What's the secret? Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Because of something down in your heart. Hallelujah. That long as that's still there. Hallelujah. That's the source of all my joy. That's the source of all my peace. That's why I'm still smiling. That's why I still can praise God. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. Hallelujah. Come on. Oh Jesus. Come on. What you afraid for? Hallelujah. Come on. I can see David say, "I've been through the storm of the lion." Hallelujah. I've been through the storm of the bear. What y'all worried about? Come on. That's cuz y'all ain't been through no storms yet. Come on. But when you've been through the storm, hallelujah, when you can trust in God, because I looked at that situation and I said, "There's no way I should have made it out." Hallelujah. I look at that situation and I said, "That should situation should have destroyed me." Hallelujah. I shouldn't even been in a number. Come on. So, if God brought me through that, I'm confident. Hallelujah. I got faith in the God that I serve. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. I don't need the sword and the spear. I don't need the shield in the buckler. Give me what I know that'll work. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Give me what I know that's proven every time. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. That excites me this morning. Come on. To know what God is doing, right? Hallelujah. You know the the more I say the more that this this life is going on and the things hit you, you might start look like you're a little crazy, right? Because to the to the world, the logical things, right? They look at logical logic, right? This is logical, right? But the more that God does for you and I, we're not looking at logic. We're looking to the unseen. Come on. We looking to the things that we can't see. That's the things that I'm believing in. Right. But because God has has brought you into another place. Do you believe that this morning? Let's let the musicians come this morning. I didn't want to be long today. Y'all feel all right this morning. Come on. The storms are coming. Come on. You know, the other week I was sharing with them. I said the other week, you know, I was sitting in and laying in the bed and it woke me up. Thunder. Thunder hit. It was so loud. I thought it was earthquake like we've been having. Hit the house. Woke me up. But right after that, it was so quiet. It was like a eerie quiet. But then all of a sudden in the in the midst of all that irrequiredness, the wind started blowing. I I believe the weather man said it was 65 miles an hour. And I started thinking, Lord, what in the world is this, right? Cuz it happened so fast. But even in that, come on, I can start singing a little song to myself that my soul is anchored. Hallelujah. The winds might blow all that. Come on. I like that little verse we always say. And if the storm don't cease, right? And if the wind don't stop blowing, come on. I added a little part that I know that in the word of God, I got a hiding place. Come on. And it's going to keep me steadfast, unremovable. Right. In spite of the storm, see those things start becoming real to you. Right? But when when it ain't when it ain't really real to you, when those times come, you won't know what to do. Right? Come on. But when it's real to you, all of a sudden, the word of God comes to you, right? Come on. And then the scripture might come. The Lord is my strength. He is the light and my light and salvation. Come on. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Whom shall I be afraid? When my enemies, even my foes came upon me, eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Right? Come on. The word of God then starts encouraging you. Right? You start reading the scripture. You start the word start coming back to you. Scripture upon scripture and then you start understanding that God Hallelujah. He's real, right? We know he's real. He's still there. He never left you. Come on. And what it is, it's enough to keep you on. Mama might not know what you're talking about. Daddy, brother, sister, husband, wife might not know what you're talking about, but God is doing something in your soul. Hallelujah. Well, everybody in turmoil, God has brought a peace upon you, right? Come on. And that peace helps you to make it through. How many believe that this morning? How many has experienced that this morning? Amen. Hallelujah. I said, God is good, ain't he? Let us bow our heads in a word of prayer this morning. Jesus. Hallelujah. The storm. Come on. I said they coming so quick now. They come before you even got chance to think about it. But once you shake yourself, hallelujah, and you realize that ain't no storm, Hallelujah. Ain't no wind, no rain, no flood, no fire that can take you out because of how you was built. Hallelujah. It started with the word. Started with Christ. Hallelujah. And it's still him now. Come on. But if you ain't there, Hallelujah. If that ain't what you built on. Oh, it'll take the mercy of God. Why don't you prepare this morning? Why don't you make ready? Come on. You better get ready. Hallelujah. The storm is brewing. You better get ready. Hallelujah. Jesus is coming. Make ready. Hallelujah. It's time out to to play. Hallelujah. It's time out to say, "I thought I was ready." better make ready. The winds are coming. Oh Jesus, be built on the rock. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Thank you Lord this morning. God, I thank you.

He out there walking. Yeah. Just as calm. And you wonder sometimes we look at people why you're so calm, right? Because it's something about when Jesus on the inside, right? It might be tossing, torn. I'm going through the same storm, but one thing about it, I got peace in it. Why? because I know who's in me, right? And he's unsinkable.
