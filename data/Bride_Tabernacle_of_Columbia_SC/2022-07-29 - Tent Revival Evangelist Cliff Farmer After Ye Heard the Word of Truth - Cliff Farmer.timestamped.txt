[1:09:16] he said but we're not going to have a
[1:09:17] meeting to tell about how smart we are
[1:09:20] we're not going to have a meeting about
[1:09:22] building a kingdom for man but we're
[1:09:23] going to have a meeting about souls
[1:09:25] being saved
[1:09:27] about those that are oppressed being
[1:09:29] delivered
[1:09:30] and so tonight i just believe there's
[1:09:32] only one thing that we can talk about
[1:09:34] that brings deliverance
[1:09:36] we're going to talk about it tonight
[1:09:38] ephesians 1 13.
[1:09:41] it says in whom he also trusted
[1:09:44] after that you heard the word of truth
[1:09:47] the gospel of your salvation
[1:09:50] in whom also after you believed you were
[1:09:53] sealed with that holy spirit
[1:09:56] of promise and you can be seated
[1:09:59] i want to take just a title tonight from
[1:10:01] the first line there
[1:10:03] after you heard the word of truth
[1:10:06] and i just want to preach to you tonight
[1:10:08] on the word of truth
[1:10:10] and let me just start off with the words
[1:10:12] of the prophet he said and who is the
[1:10:14] truth does anybody know tonight who is
[1:10:17] the truth
[1:10:18] he said jesus
[1:10:20] is the truth
[1:10:22] the truth of the gospel what gospel
[1:10:24] there is only one gospel and galatians
[1:10:27] one said though an angel preach any
[1:10:30] other gospel
[1:10:31] let him be accursed
[1:10:33] this is the gospel the gospel of your
[1:10:36] salvation not another and there is not
[1:10:40] another
[1:10:41] tonight
[1:10:43] we're just going to keep it simple
[1:10:45] and we're going to preach about the
[1:10:46] lovely powerful wonderful name of jesus
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:51] i want to talk about jesus and his
[1:10:53] precious blood you say brother i came to
[1:10:55] hear some some deep doctrine i want to
[1:10:57] tell you all the doctrine in the book is
[1:11:00] about jesus christ
[1:11:04] i i want to read you something else the
[1:11:05] prophet of god said on christ the solid
[1:11:08] rock i stand all other ground is sinking
[1:11:11] sand he said denominations will crumble
[1:11:14] and fall
[1:11:15] nations will pass away but he will
[1:11:18] remain forever
[1:11:22] pilate one time was asking the question
[1:11:24] he wanted to know where is truth at
[1:11:27] and pilate said where is truth and truth
[1:11:31] was standing in front of him i want to
[1:11:34] tell you tonight if you're looking for
[1:11:35] truth you've come to the right place
[1:11:39] truth stands in front of you
[1:11:43] we are not just another group
[1:11:46] we are not just another church on the
[1:11:48] block we are not just another gathering
[1:11:51] this is not a lodge but this is a called
[1:11:54] out group
[1:11:55] that has been called out of every age we
[1:11:58] have been called out of the last church
[1:12:00] age into the bride's age this is my age
[1:12:04] this is my time this is my revival
[1:12:14] you see
[1:12:15] you want to find truth
[1:12:17] find a church that preaches jesus
[1:12:21] the correct way
[1:12:23] because you find a church that preaches
[1:12:25] jesus only you made a human out of him
[1:12:31] and if you find a preacher a church that
[1:12:33] preaches him as a part of of three of a
[1:12:36] trinity you ain't gave him enough glory
[1:12:40] so you've got to preach jesus under the
[1:12:42] correct balance
[1:12:46] you want to know what's wrong with the
[1:12:47] churches
[1:12:48] you want to know what's wrong around the
[1:12:50] message of the hour
[1:12:52] i want to read something to you mark 5
[1:12:53] 25
[1:12:55] says a certain woman
[1:12:57] which had an issue of blood 12 years
[1:13:01] people got issues
[1:13:03] people are here for deliverance
[1:13:05] anybody need deliverance tonight
[1:13:08] anybody need healing tonight
[1:13:11] you come to the right place
[1:13:13] but i want you to watch this this woman
[1:13:15] had an issue of blood for 12 years
[1:13:19] and verse 26 says and had suffered many
[1:13:22] things
[1:13:24] of many physicians
[1:13:26] i want you to understand something
[1:13:29] the problem now was not the issue of
[1:13:31] blood that was causing her to suffer
[1:13:33] the problem now was the physicians
[1:13:37] who should be healing her is now causing
[1:13:40] her problems
[1:13:42] and the reason that the church is anemic
[1:13:45] it's because we have refused to preach
[1:13:48] the full counsel of god
[1:13:56] let's just preach about jesus in a
[1:13:58] manger listen jesus in a manger ain't
[1:14:00] gonna save you

[1:14:16] anointing

[1:14:26] preached
[1:14:28] i've been
[1:14:29] i've been
[1:14:34] i'll be hearing a lot of doctrine but i
[1:14:36] don't see the soul saved
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:40] i hear about mission reports but i don't
[1:14:43] see changed lives
[1:14:47] we have worked the people into an
[1:14:49] emotional workup and we stand in the
[1:14:52] pulpit and say you're predestinated
[1:14:54] everybody's gonna make it listen if you
[1:14:57] don't come to an altar and die to
[1:15:00] yourself you are not gonna make it
[1:15:08] everybody ain't gonna make it
[1:15:13] but see the reason people suffer is
[1:15:15] because the physicians
[1:15:17] is not bringing healing
[1:15:21] we just invite the homosexual in and let
[1:15:24] him sing
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:30] you know they got adultery in their life
[1:15:31] but they got a good voice so we just
[1:15:34] pull them on up there and let them sing
[1:15:36] [Music]
[1:15:38] and the children are sick
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:48] he said brother i came tonight to hear
[1:15:50] something up here
[1:15:52] i want to tell you how far up here it
[1:15:54] goes it reaches
[1:15:57] to the
[1:15:59] highest mountain
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:05] but brother cliff we came to this
[1:16:06] meeting to hear something deep and it
[1:16:09] flows
[1:16:12] to the
[1:16:13] lowest
[1:16:15] valley
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:22] brother that's just simple we need
[1:16:24] something to give us power the blood
[1:16:27] gives me strength
[1:16:30] from day
[1:16:32] to today
[1:16:35] i want to hear about something eternal
[1:16:36] it'll
[1:16:37] never lose
[1:16:41] come on
[1:16:43] quit trying to preach it so deep that
[1:16:45] nobody knows what you're talking about
[1:16:48] it ain't no deeper than the blood
[1:16:59] i won't talk to you about jesus for a
[1:17:01] minute
[1:17:03] just talk to you about jesus for a
[1:17:04] minute
[1:17:08] how powerful was he
[1:17:11] come on somebody how powerful was he
[1:17:14] i'll tell you how powerful he was
[1:17:17] joshua one time
[1:17:18] was wanting to lead the children of
[1:17:20] israel over but he was not able to be a
[1:17:23] redeemer
[1:17:25] and when he came before the captain of
[1:17:27] the host
[1:17:28] the captain of the whole said you are
[1:17:29] not worthy
[1:17:31] take your shoes off
[1:17:35] moses had wanted to lead god's children
[1:17:37] over
[1:17:38] and he tried to do it in himself
[1:17:40] and when moses came before the pillar of
[1:17:42] fire god said moses
[1:17:45] you're standing on some hallowed ground
[1:17:47] you thought you was hallowed i'm going
[1:17:49] to show you what hallowed is take your
[1:17:51] shoes off
[1:17:56] because taken off the shoe signifies
[1:17:59] that you are not worthy to redeem
[1:18:04] one day
[1:18:06] ruth was in need of a redeemer
[1:18:10] and in that need of a redeemer tobe came
[1:18:12] along and he said i believe i can redeem
[1:18:14] you
[1:18:16] and bow i said but i got a question for
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:19] can you redeem all of it
[1:18:22] i will tell you something you might have
[1:18:24] backslidden family members
[1:18:26] listen you don't need a god of salvation
[1:18:29] that can only forgive certain sins
[1:18:37] what we've done around the message of
[1:18:39] the hour is rate sins
[1:18:45] we won't let the adulteress back in the
[1:18:47] church
[1:18:50] but we let the self-righteous gossiper
[1:18:53] be a deacon
[1:19:02] and the people are sick
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:10] he said i don't need somebody
[1:19:12] she said i don't need somebody that can
[1:19:13] just redeem me
[1:19:14] i got some family out there
[1:19:16] i need a token good enough that i can
[1:19:19] apply it over my children i need a token
[1:19:22] good enough that i can put it over all
[1:19:24] my family i got nephews and nieces
[1:19:27] living for the devil i need a token good
[1:19:29] enough to put it on them and tobe said i
[1:19:32] can't do it and boaz said tobe take your
[1:19:36] shoe off
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:41] but one day there came another man
[1:19:44] and he came walking down to the river
[1:19:46] where john the baptist was
[1:19:48] and for the first time
[1:19:50] john was such a great man jesus said
[1:19:53] there wasn't another one like him but
[1:19:55] when john sold that redeemer he said
[1:19:58] behold the lamb of god whose shoes
[1:20:02] i am not worthy to loosen because the
[1:20:05] redeemer
[1:20:06] had stepped up to the place
[1:20:16] acts 2 36
[1:20:20] he said let all the house of israel know
[1:20:22] assuredly
[1:20:25] that that same jesus
[1:20:28] whom ye have crucified
[1:20:30] he has made that same jesus
[1:20:33] who you crucified
[1:20:35] both lord and christ
[1:20:37] i want to tell you something they're
[1:20:38] crucifying him again today
[1:20:41] they are crucifying the message but i
[1:20:43] want you to understand the message of
[1:20:45] the hour is my headship
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:51] because the message is christ
[1:20:58] somebody told me she said quit trying to
[1:20:59] get people to the message i said what do
[1:21:02] you think it is it's not another
[1:21:03] denomination it is not another
[1:21:06] organization this is christ in word form
[1:21:15] he said you crucify him
[1:21:17] but he's still lord in christ
[1:21:20] he said now when they heard this
[1:21:23] they were pricked in their heart
[1:21:26] and peter and said unto peter and the
[1:21:28] rest of the apostles
[1:21:30] men and brethren what shall we do you
[1:21:32] want to know why they ain't no altar
[1:21:33] calls we ain't preaching jesus like we
[1:21:34] ought to
[1:21:41] what if i offend someone you might get
[1:21:44] them saved
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:52] could you imagine jesus
[1:21:54] when he walked on the earth saying
[1:21:57] now i know i said except you eat my
[1:21:59] flesh and drink my blood
[1:22:01] you have no part with me but now listen
[1:22:03] let me explain that to you
[1:22:06] let me make it a little easier for you
[1:22:08] to swallow
[1:22:10] no god didn't make it easy to swallow
[1:22:13] he just laid it out there like it was
[1:22:15] and you can take it or you can leave it
[1:22:22] they began to preach he said look at
[1:22:24] this we're so afraid of offending
[1:22:26] somebody what did they do they said the
[1:22:28] one you crucified is lord
[1:22:31] look what you did and they said then
[1:22:33] what do we got to do now
[1:22:37] i want to tell you something
[1:22:38] we crucify him with our gossip
[1:22:43] we crucify him with our hatred toward
[1:22:45] one another
[1:22:47] come on don't act like you don't know
[1:22:48] what i'm talking about
[1:22:50] we all say we believe the same message
[1:22:52] and can't shake hands with one another
[1:22:54] can't put our arm around one another got
[1:22:57] a sorry attitude that i'm the only one
[1:23:00] gonna make it
[1:23:07] when did jesus die and leave you in
[1:23:09] control
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:18] see you gotta preach some stuff
[1:23:19] sometimes to get people's heart pricked
[1:23:25] can i get away with calling names
[1:23:29] can i get away with calling the name
[1:23:31] i'm not being mean
[1:23:33] when's the last time you've seen an
[1:23:34] altar call and deliverance service at
[1:23:36] joel osteen's church
[1:23:43] he ain't gonna preach nothing that
[1:23:44] pricks the heart
[1:23:46] and so now what i see is that style of
[1:23:49] ministry moving in amongst our ranks
[1:23:53] we don't want to make nobody mad because
[1:23:55] i might not get to preach the meeting
[1:23:57] next year
[1:23:58] i want to tell you something brother
[1:24:00] henry i didn't come to please you
[1:24:02] tonight i did not come to please any one
[1:24:04] of you i came to please my lord and
[1:24:07] savior
[1:24:10] [Applause]
[1:24:12] if this gets me kicked out so be it
[1:24:23] come on now we're talking about the
[1:24:24] apostles
[1:24:26] they said what we got to do he said i'll
[1:24:27] tell you what you need to do repent
[1:24:30] see we don't preach repentance around
[1:24:32] the message no more
[1:24:34] let's just preach so everybody's jumping
[1:24:36] up and down i'm the bride i'm the bride
[1:24:39] i don't think you are
[1:24:45] come walking in the church with your
[1:24:46] high heels and your makeup and your
[1:24:48] painted fingernails oh i'm the bride of
[1:24:51] jesus christ god don't care about my
[1:24:53] flesh oh yes he does
[1:24:56] [Applause]
[1:25:06] and listen
[1:25:08] we used to have to preach about the
[1:25:09] sisters wearing tight garments
[1:25:11] [Applause]
[1:25:13] but you know what's gross to me now now
[1:25:15] we gotta preach it to the boys
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:26] and they don't even realize those skinny
[1:25:28] jeans have a homosexual spirit on them
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:38] but people don't want to hear that
[1:25:40] preached anymore because it does not
[1:25:42] build churches it may not build churches
[1:25:45] but it is the foundation
[1:25:54] he said i'll tell you what you do
[1:25:56] you think you're saved
[1:25:58] you think you know the gospel you think
[1:26:00] you got it together but i want to tell
[1:26:02] you what you need to do repent
[1:26:07] see sometimes we get in trouble us
[1:26:09] preachers if we preach against things
[1:26:10] that's going on
[1:26:17] see we let's just stay away from things
[1:26:19] that offend people let me tell you
[1:26:20] something i'm gonna tell you what
[1:26:22] offends me
[1:26:23] is that our young men are watching
[1:26:25] pornography and ain't nobody gonna say
[1:26:27] nothing about it
[1:26:40] what offends me is we got young p i'm
[1:26:43] gonna step out of my bounds maybe but we
[1:26:45] got young people dating and we put them
[1:26:46] off in a car by themselves all hours of
[1:26:49] the night
[1:26:54] and don't nobody want to say nothing
[1:26:56] about it
[1:26:57] because they might get offended i want
[1:27:00] you to understand something i would
[1:27:02] rather offend your child
[1:27:05] than for that for you to have a baby
[1:27:08] born out of wedlock that you got to
[1:27:10] raise
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:20] he said let me tell you what you need to
[1:27:21] do you need to repent
[1:27:26] supposedly sisters in the message
[1:27:30] putting their bodies out there
[1:27:33] on tick-tock
[1:27:36] but don't nobody want to say nothing
[1:27:37] about it
[1:27:45] see i want i want to i want to take a
[1:27:46] scripture and i want to turn it around
[1:27:47] on you a little bit we always preach
[1:27:49] that if a man looks at a woman to lust
[1:27:52] after he committed adultery with
[1:27:56] with
[1:27:58] with
[1:27:59] so she's as guilty as he is
[1:28:02] sisters we're not trying to put you
[1:28:03] under a thumb of how you got a dress
[1:28:05] we're trying to save you from being held
[1:28:07] accountable as an adulteress
[1:28:12] it might sound like law to you but it is
[1:28:14] grace
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:22] he said now
[1:28:23] if you'll repent of this junk
[1:28:28] and then go get baptized
[1:28:31] the right way
[1:28:35] the right way
[1:28:43] i had a guy ask me one time he was he
[1:28:45] was trinity and he said i think you're
[1:28:47] oneness and i said no i'm not he said so
[1:28:49] your trinity i said no i'm not he said
[1:28:50] i'm confused
[1:28:54] he said so how do you baptize i said
[1:28:56] according to matthew 28 19 and acts 2
[1:28:59] 38.
[1:29:06] he said how do you do both i said
[1:29:08] because the bible said to baptize in the
[1:29:10] name
[1:29:12] and that's what we're doing
[1:29:13] and the scripture also said that all
[1:29:15] that you do in word and deed be done in
[1:29:18] the name of jesus and baptism is a deed
[1:29:22] so therefore we do it in the name of
[1:29:24] jesus
[1:29:28] see here's the problem
[1:29:29] here's a problem we have these meetings
[1:29:32] is this okay i hope i hope it's all
[1:29:34] right
[1:29:35] we we have these meetings around the
[1:29:37] message
[1:29:38] and we're trying to get all these young
[1:29:40] people to the holy ghost that ain't
[1:29:41] never repented yet
[1:29:49] and you know why they ain't repented yet
[1:29:52] because they watched mom and daddy and
[1:29:54] ain't never seen you repent
[1:30:03] see we keep having to have youth
[1:30:04] services we're going to have a youth
[1:30:05] service in the morning thank god for it
[1:30:09] but i'm going to tell you what we need
[1:30:11] we need some parents at the altar
[1:30:12] tonight
[1:30:16] so that when the children get something
[1:30:17] tomorrow they got a clean home to go to
[1:30:24] but let me tell you why let me just tell
[1:30:26] you this because this is in the ranks of
[1:30:28] our ministries brother brooks isn't it
[1:30:31] the reason people don't preach against
[1:30:32] pornography the preachers are watching
[1:30:34] it too
[1:30:42] the reason we cannot bring freedom is
[1:30:45] because we are bound
[1:30:47] and the scripture said how can he be
[1:30:49] bring freedom that be bound
[1:30:53] let me just tell you this i don't want
[1:30:54] to go to no doctor that's covering up
[1:30:56] his arms because he got leprosy on him
[1:31:00] but he who would heal the sick
[1:31:02] must not be a leper
[1:31:09] ain't none of that in there
[1:31:13] see we want an effect
[1:31:14] you got to preach jesus
[1:31:19] verse 41 of the same chapter says then
[1:31:21] they that gladly received his word were
[1:31:23] baptized
[1:31:25] when they preached something that
[1:31:27] pricked their
[1:31:28] heart and the same day there were three
[1:31:31] thousand added unto them
[1:31:35] the same day they were added unto them
[1:31:38] three thousand souls
[1:31:42] why
[1:31:44] they just preached the living god
[1:31:47] brother john they preached about a real
[1:31:49] jesus
[1:31:51] and they had an experience with him
[1:31:54] they knew about him the reason we don't
[1:31:56] see these things preached we don't have
[1:31:57] the experiences like we used to
[1:32:02] i better leave that alone let me just go
[1:32:04] home
[1:32:06] i want to show you some one time there
[1:32:07] was a woman
[1:32:10] she
[1:32:11] was a part
[1:32:12] of the kingdom of god
[1:32:14] but she kept walking to the well
[1:32:18] at a different time of day than
[1:32:19] everybody else
[1:32:22] and you understand i began to think that
[1:32:24] there was a lot of pharisees around and
[1:32:25] nobody went out to the well at that hour
[1:32:27] to witness to her
[1:32:31] and so jesus is going walking to the
[1:32:33] well and now he says
[1:32:35] uh you know disciples why don't y'all go
[1:32:37] on into town
[1:32:42] i'm gonna tell you something sometimes
[1:32:43] at our church i don't know about y'all
[1:32:45] but at our church sometimes the greatest
[1:32:47] move of the holy ghost we have is after
[1:32:49] we dismiss service
[1:32:51] and the unbeliever leaves and the
[1:32:53] make-believer leaves
[1:32:54] and the one that was fixed in his car
[1:32:57] sitting on the pew leaves and the one
[1:32:59] that's been mad at the song leader
[1:33:02] leaves
[1:33:05] and pretty soon brother wesley all the
[1:33:07] barriers are gone
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:17] so jesus said i just need y'all to go on
[1:33:19] into the city
[1:33:21] because if there's one thing jesus knew
[1:33:23] you can't heal the sick
[1:33:26] and you can't save the lost
[1:33:28] you cannot witness to the adulterer
[1:33:31] with a legalistic christian with you
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:46] i might have to get my brother to start
[1:33:47] the car for me
[1:33:49] we'll just leave town tonight
[1:33:54] so jesus begins to talk to her now this
[1:33:57] ain't the first man that's ever talked
[1:33:58] to her
[1:34:01] and jesus said i want uh i want
[1:34:03] something to drink and she said well
[1:34:06] oh
[1:34:07] sir you ain't got nothing to draw with
[1:34:11] he was drawing her right then
[1:34:15] she done bit under that first pool
[1:34:20] and uh so
[1:34:22] he said uh where's your husband
[1:34:28] she said i don't have one
[1:34:31] he said well that's true
[1:34:34] you had five
[1:34:38] and you got one right now that ain't
[1:34:39] yours
[1:34:42] i want you to understand something she
[1:34:43] done had six messenger excuse me six men
[1:34:49] in her life
[1:34:51] but when the seventh man
[1:34:53] began to speak to her she said sir
[1:34:57] i perceive that thou art a prophet
[1:35:03] and the scripture said she ran into the
[1:35:06] city
[1:35:07] but i want you to notice something when
[1:35:09] a change comes
[1:35:11] brother brooks talked about a change
[1:35:13] when a change comes
[1:35:14] according to the scripture that was the
[1:35:17] last day that she ever walked to the
[1:35:19] well alone
[1:35:21] but when she came back to the well
[1:35:23] brother woosley she had the whole city
[1:35:26] with her
[1:35:29] i'll tell you what if we will get off of
[1:35:31] our self-righteous high horses and begin
[1:35:34] to witness to the lost
[1:35:36] and to the drunkard and the drug addict
[1:35:38] and the harlot we might see the city of
[1:35:41] columbia in revival
[1:35:56] long i've been i don't even i don't know
[1:35:57] what time i got up here
[1:36:01] we're just talking about jesus
[1:36:05] can i read something brother bradham
[1:36:06] said to you
[1:36:14] you know what i'm tired of
[1:36:16] i'm tired of being people being ashamed
[1:36:18] of who we are
[1:36:28] quit being ashamed of who you are
[1:36:31] what if we offend someone
[1:36:34] you got to say enough to prick their
[1:36:35] heart or there ain't going to be no
[1:36:37] change
[1:36:40] he said he was the fulfillment of the
[1:36:42] word
[1:36:44] all types was fulfilled in him
[1:36:49] he became
[1:36:51] jehovah
[1:36:52] of the new testament
[1:36:55] he was the old testament jehovah
[1:36:58] the word then
[1:36:59] which was in the pillar of fire
[1:37:02] was made manifest and dwelt among us
[1:37:06] jehovah of the old testament
[1:37:09] became jesus of the new testament
[1:37:13] god didn't go nowhere
[1:37:16] he just changed offices
[1:37:19] oh i want to tell you something i work
[1:37:20] in an office and it's all i can do to
[1:37:23] fulfill my one job
[1:37:25] but we had a god so great
[1:37:27] that he could fulfill three offices
[1:37:30] of father son and holy ghost
[1:37:32] he could fulfill the office of twelve of
[1:37:34] seven redemptive names of jehovah
[1:37:43] the old testament
[1:37:47] calls him
[1:37:48] jehovah
[1:37:51] the lord
[1:37:53] my shepherd
[1:37:58] and in the new testament john 10 11 he
[1:38:00] said i'm
[1:38:02] the good shepherd
[1:38:05] and the good shepherd giveth his life
[1:38:07] for the sheep
[1:38:09] in the old testament
[1:38:11] he's called jehovah jireh
[1:38:14] our provider
[1:38:21] anybody need providing tonight
[1:38:26] i will tell you this world's in a mess
[1:38:29] and we need some providing
[1:38:32] we need some healing provided we need
[1:38:35] come on we we don't want to talk about
[1:38:36] finances but i'm going to tell you
[1:38:37] something i didn't come for your money
[1:38:38] but we all need some finances
[1:38:43] and see the reason the world's getting
[1:38:45] it and we ain't it's because we're
[1:38:46] afraid to talk about it
[1:38:52] but philippians 4 19 said but my god
[1:38:54] shall supply
[1:38:55] all your need
[1:38:59] according to
[1:39:01] his riches
[1:39:05] i had a brother calling me today and he
[1:39:07] was talking about something and i didn't
[1:39:08] know how tied in tonight brother bill
[1:39:11] but he said you know he said i heard
[1:39:12] about a brother that just built a church
[1:39:15] and he said man
[1:39:17] he said he put millions of dollars in it
[1:39:21] but bragged because they put 50 000 in
[1:39:23] foreign missions
[1:39:26] and i begin to think
[1:39:29] 50 000 is a lot of money to me
[1:39:35] but depending on your
[1:39:38] status there's people in this united
[1:39:41] states that could give a billion and
[1:39:42] wouldn't miss it
[1:39:49] i figured out the other day
[1:39:50] you know this this guy that's in the
[1:39:52] news elon musk
[1:39:55] i figured up his finances
[1:39:57] i told my guys at work i said let me let
[1:39:59] me tell you something this man could
[1:40:01] make
[1:40:02] 272
[1:40:05] billion people or million people
[1:40:08] millionaires
[1:40:12] and still be a billionaire
[1:40:23] but i want to tell you some everything
[1:40:25] ellen musk owns
[1:40:27] god owns the ground under it
[1:40:32] he owns the cattle on a thousand hills
[1:40:35] and he owns the hills beneath the cattle
[1:40:39] and the scripture didn't say he'll
[1:40:40] supply your needs according to your
[1:40:43] riches
[1:40:44] he's not going to supply brother john
[1:40:46] according to donald trump's riches
[1:40:49] but he's going to supply your need
[1:40:52] according to his riches
[1:40:55] where in christ jesus
[1:41:01] the old testament called him jehovah
[1:41:03] raphae
[1:41:04] the lord that healeth thee in matthew 9
[1:41:06] 35 said and jesus went about all the
[1:41:09] cities and villages teaching in their
[1:41:11] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[1:41:13] the kingdom and healing every sickness
[1:41:16] and every disease among the people
[1:41:22] what are we going to do about covert
[1:41:23] preach jesus
[1:41:24] [Applause]
[1:41:27] what are we going to do about monkey pox
[1:41:29] preached jesus
[1:41:39] come on i'm going to tell you we're so
[1:41:40] worried
[1:41:49] we wear a mask to church because we're
[1:41:51] so afraid of the guy next to us
[1:41:59] and sometimes i see people in such
[1:42:01] spiritual condition
[1:42:03] such spiritual sickness i want to put a
[1:42:05] mask on
[1:42:09] we're so worried about the devil giving
[1:42:11] us covenant taking this body and we've
[1:42:13] been letting him eat away at family
[1:42:16] altar
[1:42:18] our children know about the third pull
[1:42:21] but don't know how what a prayer clause
[1:42:24] it is
[1:42:25] our children can preach to us the
[1:42:27] opening of the seventh seal but don't
[1:42:30] know what the holy ghost is yet
[1:42:33] [Applause]
[1:42:45] i better move on
[1:42:47] he'll heal the disease matthew 12 15
[1:42:49] said but when jesus knew it he withdrew
[1:42:51] himself from fence and the great
[1:42:53] multitude followed him and he healed
[1:42:55] them all i'm going to tell you something
[1:42:56] you want to get some healing tonight you
[1:42:58] want some deliverance tonight just start
[1:43:00] following him
[1:43:04] romans 5 17 the old testament called him
[1:43:07] jehovah sid canoe
[1:43:10] the lord our righteousness
[1:43:13] romans 5 17 said for if by one man's
[1:43:16] offense death reigned once
[1:43:18] much more they which receive the
[1:43:20] abundance of grace and of the gift of
[1:43:22] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:43:24] jesus christ
[1:43:27] the old testament called him jehovah
[1:43:29] shalom
[1:43:30] the lord is our peace anybody in need of
[1:43:33] peace
[1:43:37] the nations are shaking
[1:43:40] russia's ready to bomb
[1:43:42] israel wants to bomb
[1:43:44] north korea wants to bomb
[1:43:47] the united states wants to bomb
[1:43:49] everybody's ready to kill somebody and
[1:43:52] we just need some peace
[1:43:58] and ephesians 2 14 said he
[1:44:02] is our peace
[1:44:04] who hath made both one
[1:44:07] and hath broken down the middle wall of
[1:44:09] the partition between us
[1:44:13] i'm going to tell you i've been around
[1:44:16] i've done some traveling
[1:44:19] and i'll tell you how i know jesus ain't
[1:44:21] been preached there's too many partition
[1:44:23] walls up
[1:44:35] within an hour drive of my house
[1:44:38] i've preached in a upc church
[1:44:43] i preached in a trinity pentecostal
[1:44:46] church i preach in a baptist church
[1:44:54] but the message churches
[1:44:57] don't want nothing to do with this
[1:45:04] because we don't have the right guys
[1:45:06] preach our meetings
[1:45:17] come on
[1:45:19] where's the holy ghost leadership
[1:45:23] brother brooks we don't ever know who's
[1:45:25] going to preach our meeting
[1:45:29] my pastor called me the other day he
[1:45:31] said hey i got a meeting invitation
[1:45:32] brother you can pull my you can't pull
[1:45:34] my coattail i took it off
[1:45:36] you can pull on my shirt if i get out of
[1:45:38] line
[1:45:39] my pastor called me said brother cliff i
[1:45:41] just got a meeting invitation in the
[1:45:42] mail tell me who's preaching it
[1:45:46] and i told him who was preaching it and
[1:45:47] i told him what order they would preach
[1:45:49] in because around the message we got
[1:45:52] preachers preaching what night based on
[1:45:54] their batting average
[1:46:00] we have turned the house of god into an
[1:46:03] entertainment center
[1:46:04] and if you're good with altar calls you
[1:46:06] can have saturday night
[1:46:08] but if you're the beginner of the clique
[1:46:10] we let you take wednesday night
[1:46:16] come on now
[1:46:19] and around this message we've got so
[1:46:21] stiff and so starchy we can't love one
[1:46:24] another we can't put our arms around one
[1:46:26] another because we disagree on doctrine
[1:46:30] what is wrong
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:42] see i brother brother yvonne i may be
[1:46:44] mistaken but i thought the message came
[1:46:46] to pull us out of denominational barrier
[1:46:57] but if you're preaching jesus he said
[1:46:59] the middle wall has been torn down
[1:47:06] if the middle wall is down let me tell
[1:47:08] you another change that's going to
[1:47:09] happen
[1:47:10] i might get kicked out for this one
[1:47:12] but galatians 3 27 said as many as
[1:47:14] you've been baptized into christ you've
[1:47:16] put on christ
[1:47:18] there is neither
[1:47:21] jew
[1:47:24] nor greek
[1:47:31] i'm gonna get in trouble
[1:47:35] there's neither jew or greek
[1:47:37] there's neither bond or free
[1:47:39] there's neither male or female
[1:47:41] for you're all one
[1:47:47] can i give can i can i be free
[1:47:51] so why does the white church only have
[1:47:53] white preachers preach the meetings
[1:47:57] [Applause]
[1:48:04] i won't tell you what god did for me
[1:48:06] when god saved my soul
[1:48:08] he saved me from being white
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:18] when god saved my soul
[1:48:20] he made me and you the same
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:25] so tell me why we still got a racist
[1:48:27] devil around the message
[1:48:32] come on don't say it ain't there we know
[1:48:34] it's laying there we see it laying there
[1:48:37] but if we will preach christ
[1:48:40] that partition must come down
[1:48:43] [Applause]
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:52] my last name is farmer but farmer
[1:48:54] carries things that i don't want when
[1:48:57] god saved me he saved me from being a
[1:48:59] farmer he saved me from being white he
[1:49:02] saved me from being human and now i'm a
[1:49:05] messiah
[1:49:14] and now when i hurt you hurt
[1:49:20] come on we got so messed up around this
[1:49:22] around this message if a brother don't
[1:49:24] agree with us and the air conditioner
[1:49:26] goes out of this house
[1:49:28] if he don't agree with us we won't help
[1:49:29] him at all
[1:49:31] i'm going to tell you the word of god
[1:49:33] came to tear down partitions
[1:49:36] and when you heard i should hurt
[1:49:40] i got to move on i got to move on
[1:49:44] jehovah shammai
[1:49:46] says the lord
[1:49:48] is present
[1:49:50] with us
[1:49:53] i don't need an old testament god
[1:50:00] i don't need a jesus of 2000 years ago
[1:50:07] and i don't need a god that only worked
[1:50:09] up until 1965.
[1:50:21] you see the problem
[1:50:23] is that daniel was a prophet
[1:50:27] but the problem was
[1:50:29] that there was a king that rose up
[1:50:31] that instead of worshiping the god of
[1:50:33] daniel
[1:50:34] he said we need to bow down to the
[1:50:35] prophet daniel
[1:50:47] and that same devil is around our ranks
[1:50:49] again saying you need to take the
[1:50:50] preachers out of the pulpit
[1:51:05] jehovah's the lord present
[1:51:09] not a god of yesterday
[1:51:13] i don't need a yesterday god
[1:51:16] i hear the rain
[1:51:23] thank the lord for the rain
[1:51:27] oh it might be raining out there
[1:51:30] but i don't know if it's out there like
[1:51:32] it is up here but it's raining in here
[1:51:33] too
[1:51:40] the lord present with us
[1:51:42] we had a sister in our church
[1:51:45] 16 years old
[1:51:47] the doctor said we got to go in
[1:51:50] have a full surgery and take all of your
[1:51:52] all of your organs out i'm just going to
[1:51:54] say it that way
[1:51:58] they said you've got tumors
[1:52:02] but i serve a bigger god than a god of
[1:52:05] of tumors
[1:52:08] and one sunday morning i was getting up
[1:52:09] ready for church and the lord just began
[1:52:11] to lay that little sister on my heart
[1:52:14] i began to pray for and i walked to the
[1:52:16] pulpit that morning and i said little
[1:52:17] sister
[1:52:18] i don't know what's going on with you i
[1:52:20] said but have you felt like your world
[1:52:21] is falling apart
[1:52:25] she said yeah
[1:52:26] i said did you feel like it today
[1:52:30] she said yes i did
[1:52:31] i said well god sent me here this
[1:52:33] morning to tell you he loves you
[1:52:38] so that sister came up for prayer and
[1:52:39] she says the doctor says i gotta have a
[1:52:41] total surgery take everything out i'll
[1:52:43] never be able to have children 16 years
[1:52:45] old
[1:52:49] so they scheduled the surgery
[1:52:52] we had prayer
[1:52:54] but the doctor said no it's still there
[1:52:55] we need to schedule the surgery
[1:52:58] so two weeks ago
[1:53:00] they went in for the surgery
[1:53:03] and the doctor cut her open
[1:53:05] and cut and showed her back up
[1:53:08] and she came out in the wedding room and
[1:53:10] she said listen
[1:53:12] i don't know what's going on
[1:53:15] but the tumors are not there
[1:53:19] the only thing that is there is scar
[1:53:22] tissue
[1:53:23] where the surgery has already been
[1:53:25] performed
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:31] jehovah
[1:53:32] present with us
[1:53:35] [Applause]
[1:53:41] we had a man sitting back on the back
[1:53:42] corner of our church here just just uh
[1:53:44] about two years ago he's 92 years old
[1:53:48] he fell out
[1:53:50] in the middle of service
[1:53:51] people kind of got it kind of frankie
[1:53:53] our pastor said don't worry about it
[1:53:54] just keep on preaching
[1:53:59] you know 92 years old
[1:54:05] let him go
[1:54:06] home but that ain't what god wanted to
[1:54:09] do
[1:54:11] we had a
[1:54:13] i can't think of what you call a first
[1:54:15] responder that goes to our church
[1:54:17] and he went over and checked his pulse
[1:54:19] and he said he told our pastor he said
[1:54:21] brother david he's dead
[1:54:23] and brother david just said move
[1:54:26] i won't say sometimes you just got to
[1:54:27] show the unbelief out the way
[1:54:34] i'm talking about god present
[1:54:38] he walked down and he laid his hand on
[1:54:40] him and he said brother daryl
[1:54:42] in the name of jesus
[1:54:45] and he set up and he said what's going
[1:54:46] on
[1:54:53] hold up a minute
[1:54:56] i can kind of
[1:54:58] i can kind of feel the unbelief
[1:55:02] was he really dead
[1:55:05] i'm just going to say they ain't no
[1:55:06] other way to say it he lost control of
[1:55:08] his bladder he lost control of his
[1:55:10] bowels the man was dead
[1:55:12] but i serve a god that is present with
[1:55:15] us
[1:55:23] and john 1 14 said the word was made
[1:55:25] flesh
[1:55:27] and dwelt among us
[1:55:30] the old testament called him jehovah
[1:55:32] nisai
[1:55:34] our banner
[1:55:36] and a banner is an ensign
[1:55:38] or something that is lifted up
[1:55:42] and if you'll forgive me for just a few
[1:55:43] more moments i want to tell you
[1:55:45] i'm seeing a lot of banners lifted up
[1:55:47] around this message
[1:55:50] but i'm not seeing too many jesus

[1:56:47] if you've been lifting another banner i
[1:56:48] want you to raise your hand
[1:56:51] and i want you to grab a hold of your
[1:56:52] banner that's been up over your head
[1:56:54] and i don't care what preacher it was

[1:57:03] banners of preachers around this message

[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:18] we've raised the banner of martin
[1:57:21] come on man
[1:57:23] my parents went to a church when they
[1:57:24] were when they when they were young with
[1:57:26] when i was um
[1:57:28] my mom was carrying me and the pastor
[1:57:30] committed adultery but he wanted to keep
[1:57:31] the church under his thumb
[1:57:33] so when he committed adultery he said
[1:57:35] i've been living in adultery for seven
[1:57:36] years but i want you know i remain the
[1:57:38] pastor of this church
[1:57:40] so my dad went to the pastor and he said
[1:57:42] no
[1:57:45] we're leaving
[1:57:47] and so they came out to the car
[1:57:50] and they got my mom she was nine months
[1:57:52] pregnant with me
[1:57:53] and they said sister
[1:57:55] you all better not leave the church
[1:57:58] god might do something to that baby
[1:58:11] well he did he called me to preach
[1:58:14] and he saved my soul and he set my foot
[1:58:17] up on a rock and he told me to declare
[1:58:20] the glad tidings of the name of jesus
[1:58:24] and he sent me tonight to tell you if
[1:58:27] you have been bound you can go free

[1:58:55] sung the song fear has no rule any
[1:58:58] longer
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:01] [Applause]
[1:59:08] i think it's time
[1:59:10] that we tear down every banner that has
[1:59:12] been lifted
[1:59:14] it is time that we quit making meetings
[1:59:18] to be good meetings because of who's
[1:59:20] preaching it
[1:59:25] you you let me tell you something i'm
[1:59:27] guilty
[1:59:29] i remember when i was a young person
[1:59:32] brother simmons i
[1:59:33] i was seeking the holy ghost
[1:59:36] and because people pump certain
[1:59:38] preachers you know
[1:59:43] well i remember one time i prayed i said
[1:59:44] oh god
[1:59:46] if you'll just let brother jewelforney
[1:59:48] come preach i know i'll get the holy
[1:59:50] ghost
[1:59:55] we
[1:59:59] we had some young people that went to a
[2:00:00] camp recently
[2:00:02] and when they came home
[2:00:04] you know i thought when they we sent
[2:00:05] them to camp they're supposed to get the
[2:00:06] holy ghost and come home and spread it
[2:00:13] but instead they came home and they said
[2:00:15] boy all of the other young people that
[2:00:17] are struggling we just need to get them
[2:00:19] to camp
[2:00:23] you know why that type of mentality is
[2:00:25] around the message
[2:00:27] because if we quit saying it the camps
[2:00:29] will shut down
[2:00:34] i'm sorry i can tell some of you didn't
[2:00:36] like that
[2:00:39] but i'm going to tell you something i'm
[2:00:40] not willing to spend
[2:00:42] 500
[2:00:44] to send my children to a camp
[2:00:48] that makes them feel good for about 10
[2:00:50] days
[2:00:53] but they got the same lust devils
[2:00:55] they listening to the same rap music
[2:01:10] but i'm going to tell you what'll happen
[2:01:12] in a meeting
[2:01:13] you want to see deliverance tonight
[2:01:16] you want to see healing tonight
[2:01:18] john 12 32 says but ah
[2:01:23] jesus talking
[2:01:25] if i be lifted up
[2:01:29] if we will quit lifting men
[2:01:32] and quit lifting organizations
[2:01:34] and quit lifting denominations
[2:01:37] but if i
[2:01:38] would be lifted up
[2:01:40] i will draw men unto me i want you to
[2:01:43] understand the reason i preach jesus i
[2:01:46] want the sinner to be drawn tonight
[2:01:49] i want the young man with lust to be
[2:01:51] drawn tonight
[2:01:52] i want the sister with depression to be
[2:01:54] drawn tonight
[2:01:58] and if i will lift him up
[2:02:02] he will draw all men unto him
[2:02:05] my question to you
[2:02:07] are you lifting him up
[2:02:14] you say brother cliff
[2:02:15] i really wanted to hear
[2:02:18] about the seventh seal tonight
[2:02:21] you did
[2:02:29] brother cliff i wanted to hear about the
[2:02:30] third pull tonight you did
[2:02:35] i i wanted to hear a rapturing message
[2:02:37] you did
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:40] you see you understand just because the
[2:02:42] terminology may not sound like what we
[2:02:44] we always do
[2:02:48] hey i'm telling you i told my pastor
[2:02:50] yesterday i said i wish i could get out
[2:02:51] of preaching this meeting
[2:02:53] because i ain't no meeting preacher i
[2:02:55] don't have no hype to have nobody up
[2:02:57] with it i don't have no deep doctrine
[2:03:00] but i'll tell you what i do have
[2:03:02] i came to you tonight with power
[2:03:04] and with demonstration
[2:03:06] of the holy ghost
[2:03:13] i want to tell you something i don't
[2:03:14] care how deep you preach if it is not
[2:03:16] bringing glory to jesus go back to the
[2:03:19] abc's again
[2:03:26] what time i need to close brother
[2:03:31] acts 4 8 said then peter filled with the
[2:03:33] holy ghost said unto them
[2:03:35] rulers of the people
[2:03:37] be it known unto you
[2:03:39] that by the name of jesus christ whom
[2:03:40] you crucified
[2:03:42] from the dead that whom god raised from
[2:03:44] the dead even by him does this man stand
[2:03:47] before you whole
[2:03:49] this is the stone which will said it not
[2:03:52] of you builders which has become the
[2:03:53] head of the coroner
[2:03:55] why
[2:03:56] is it important to preach jesus
[2:03:58] the next verse says because there is
[2:04:00] salvation
[2:04:03] neither is there salvation in any other
[2:04:05] for there is none other name under
[2:04:07] heaven
[2:04:08] given among men whereby we must be saved
[2:04:14] see now i know what some of y'all don't
[2:04:15] think
[2:04:17] well the cliff just ain't too smart
[2:04:18] you're right
[2:04:21] i'm a high school dropout
[2:04:30] verse 13 said when they saw the boldness
[2:04:32] of peter and john they perceived they
[2:04:33] were unlearned and ignorant
[2:04:39] it said but they took knowledge of them
[2:04:41] that they had been with jesus
[2:04:43] oh i want to tell you i may not preach
[2:04:45] deep to your satisfaction i may not lift
[2:04:48] you up into the heavenlies tonight but
[2:04:50] when we leave here i want you to
[2:04:52] understand one thing that this preacher
[2:04:54] has been with jesus
[2:05:02] and paul said it this way brethren when
[2:05:04] i came to you i came not with excellency
[2:05:06] or speak
[2:05:09] or of wisdom
[2:05:10] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[2:05:13] for i determined not to know anything
[2:05:16] among you
[2:05:19] what
[2:05:23] let's have a minister's meeting and see
[2:05:25] who's who knows the most about the
[2:05:28] seventh seal
[2:05:35] i thought about just starting to travel
[2:05:37] to all these ministers meeting brother
[2:05:38] brooks
[2:05:41] and when it comes my turn just stand up
[2:05:42] and say i don't know nothing but jesus
[2:05:44] christ and him crucified
[2:05:51] i want to ask you this
[2:05:53] what has your arguing doctrine helped
[2:05:56] your kids
[2:06:04] what has arguing doctrine done for your
[2:06:07] young people in your church
[2:06:14] has arguing doctrine helped your
[2:06:17] marriage issues
[2:06:22] brother you said marriage issue see we
[2:06:24] got marriage issues around the church
[2:06:34] i want to tell you something i'm just
[2:06:35] going to leave this here i don't know
[2:06:36] why it just it just got spoke to me okay
[2:06:40] brother when you text another woman
[2:06:42] that's not your wife
[2:06:45] and it might not be inappropriate but
[2:06:47] you delete the text
[2:06:49] so your wife don't find it
[2:06:52] you are already in the adultery path
[2:07:05] am i crazy
[2:07:08] there was a sister in church the other
[2:07:10] day said brother cliff can i have your
[2:07:11] phone number and i said no you got my
[2:07:13] wives
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:17] sorry am i too old school for you i
[2:07:19] don't know maybe maybe i was born in the
[2:07:21] wrong generation but i'm going to tell
[2:07:23] you something the devil is coming in and
[2:07:26] we're allowing it
[2:07:28] and we just ain't preaching against it
[2:07:30] but i have come tonight to tell you
[2:07:32] there is a deliverance
[2:07:41] i want to just say this to you
[2:07:44] a quote from brother william branham he
[2:07:46] said
[2:07:46] he speaking of jesus
[2:07:50] is the principle theme
[2:07:52] of the entire bible
[2:07:56] the whole bible
[2:07:57] is about one name
[2:08:02] see well you shouldn't have said brother
[2:08:04] branham's name i say billy graham's name
[2:08:07] nobody gets offended
[2:08:10] see you remember what i said earlier
[2:08:11] quit being ashamed of what you are
[2:08:16] go to a pentecostal church
[2:08:18] they're going to preach to you whether
[2:08:20] you ever been in there or not tongues is
[2:08:22] the initial evidence of the holy ghost
[2:08:25] go to a baptist church they're going to
[2:08:28] preach to you whether you've ever been
[2:08:29] in there or not that once saved always
[2:08:32] saved
[2:08:36] you got to quit being afraid of who you
[2:08:37] are
[2:08:39] he is the principal theme
[2:08:42] of the entire bible
[2:08:50] he said this he said if you read the
[2:08:51] bible
[2:08:53] and don't see christ in every verse
[2:08:58] go back and read it again
[2:09:02] [Applause]
[2:09:09] brother bill i could have come tonight
[2:09:12] and i could have preached about joshua
[2:09:14] and the exodus and all the types
[2:09:20] but joshua just means jesus
[2:09:25] and i could have come to you tonight and
[2:09:27] i could have talked about ruth and boaz
[2:09:29] and the threshing floor and the barley
[2:09:31] and all the seasons and we could have
[2:09:33] went through the tights but boaz is
[2:09:35] jesus
[2:09:41] i could have come and preached to you
[2:09:43] about rahab the harlot and how that a
[2:09:45] token was given to her and she applied
[2:09:48] the token over her home but the token
[2:09:51] the scarlet cord was jesus
[2:10:02] you want to go further
[2:10:03] i could have come and preached to you
[2:10:05] about the fire on the altar of elijah
[2:10:07] but what you understand is when a word
[2:10:09] prophet is on the scene that is jesus
[2:10:19] i could have come and preached all seven
[2:10:21] church ages well what i did tonight was
[2:10:23] preach to you what all seven church age
[2:10:25] messengers made their sermons about
[2:10:29] every message paul preached was jesus
[2:10:32] christ him crucified and when our
[2:10:34] prophet preached he said my message has
[2:10:37] always been the same
[2:10:38] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:10:42] and forever i preach what paul preached
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:52] quit getting so deep that nobody knows
[2:10:55] what you're talking about
[2:10:58] [Music]
[2:11:08] we got
[2:11:09] we got a real young church
[2:11:12] the devil came through and just
[2:11:14] wrecked our church and split it
[2:11:18] but all them old people that wanted to
[2:11:19] wear their shorts and
[2:11:25] wanted to live any way they would just
[2:11:26] want to live sloppy and call it grace
[2:11:29] they all left
[2:11:32] and now we got a bunch of young people
[2:11:34] that want to serve god
[2:11:38] and i told my pastor this i said brother
[2:11:40] david i want i want you to know
[2:11:42] this is my heart now
[2:11:45] if i'm preaching redemption
[2:11:48] or if i'm preaching about
[2:11:50] finances
[2:11:52] or if i preach about the seventh seal
[2:11:56] or if i preach about predestination
[2:11:59] if i it does not matter what i preach
[2:12:04] brother bill
[2:12:05] if the five-year-old child on the chair
[2:12:08] don't get it
[2:12:10] i failed
[2:12:19] and i believe the reason we have to have
[2:12:21] so many youth meetings brother junior
[2:12:23] i'm not against them don't get me wrong
[2:12:26] but the reason we have to have them
[2:12:30] is because the preachers
[2:12:31] want to please the people like pilate
[2:12:33] did
[2:12:37] and if we just preach it simple
[2:12:41] they might not want to hear us no more
[2:12:44] i will tell you something i drove the
[2:12:45] other day i drove up into missouri i was
[2:12:48] preaching
[2:12:49] brothers you know how sometimes you
[2:12:51] preach one of the messages that just
[2:12:52] don't work
[2:12:55] right
[2:12:58] man i had my head low i said man that
[2:13:00] was awful
[2:13:03] but right at the end of service a real
[2:13:06] sweet quiet spirit moved in
[2:13:10] we got out of church and my wife told me
[2:13:12] she said did you hear that little baby
[2:13:13] crying i said no
[2:13:15] there was about a six-year-old girl
[2:13:18] that when that presence began to move
[2:13:19] through the room she began to cry
[2:13:22] and her mama thought something was wrong
[2:13:23] with her
[2:13:25] and she took her out of the church and
[2:13:26] she said honey what's wrong with you and
[2:13:28] she said i don't know
[2:13:30] all i know is i felt something
[2:13:34] and i couldn't stop crying
[2:13:38] brother brooks i told my wife i said if
[2:13:40] god sent me to missouri
[2:13:42] so one six-year-old girl could get an
[2:13:45] experience with the holy ghost
[2:13:48] it's worth every mile of the trip
[2:14:01] if you don't see him
[2:14:03] in every line of scripture
[2:14:06] just go back and read it again
[2:14:09] i'm nearing the end
[2:14:12] but i just went back through the
[2:14:13] scripture because i thought calling him
[2:14:16] jesus
[2:14:18] that just this ain't enough
[2:14:22] you know what i mean
[2:14:23] how many of you brothers love your wife
[2:14:27] sometimes you just gotta tell her
[2:14:31] my goodness you're gorgeous
[2:14:43] hey
[2:14:44] fold them angels wings up and lay them
[2:14:47] on the chair
[2:14:49] we all like compliments
[2:14:52] husbands how many of you would like for
[2:14:54] your wife to just tell you how handsome
[2:14:56] you are
[2:15:04] i think sometimes jesus
[2:15:07] would dislike for his wife
[2:15:10] to just talk about how wonderful he is
[2:15:19] can i begin to look through the
[2:15:20] scripture
[2:15:22] of everything that ties to my lovely
[2:15:24] lord jesus
[2:15:26] and i see that the scripture said he is
[2:15:28] my advocate
[2:15:32] and the scripture said he is the
[2:15:34] almighty the scripture said he's the
[2:15:37] alpha and the omega
[2:15:39] and he is the amen
[2:15:41] he is the atonement
[2:15:43] he's the author and perfecter of our
[2:15:46] faith
[2:15:46] he is the ancient of days
[2:15:49] the beginning and the end the bread of
