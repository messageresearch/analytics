those sicknesses in the land and death angel moving and so much going on and people just don't know which way to turn well brother let's just keep looking to jesus amen because he understand and we'll understand better by and by when the morning come and somebody said he'll understand amen and i know he understands amen how much we can bear and what we're going through jeremiah 6 and 14 it says they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace and when there is no peace were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them they should be cast down said the lord thus said the lord stand ye in the way and see and ask for the old path where [Music] is the good way and walk there in and ye shall find rest for your soul but they say we will not walk therein also i set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet but they say we will not hearken therefore here you nations and no old congregation what is among them here or earth behold i will bring evil among this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words not my law but rejected it to what purpose coming there to me incense from shebo and sweet cane from the country for of our country your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifice sweet unto me therefore thus said the lord behold i will lay a stumbling block before this people and the fathers and the son together shall fall upon them their neighbors and his friends should perish thus said the lord behold a people come from the north country and a great nation shall be rise from the side of the earth they shall lay hole on the bow and spear and they are cured cruel they are cruel have no mercy their voice rolled like the sea and they ride upon horses set in a ray as men for war against the old daughters of zion we have heard the frame they are our hands of wax feeble anguish has taken hold of us and pain as a woman in travail go not forth into the field no walk by the way for the sword of the enemy and the fear is on every side god bless to read this word you may be seated the 16th verse says thus said the lord stand ye in the ways and see and act for the good for the old path tonight i said give me that old-time religion the old time religion praise god somebody says take me back dear lord so when i first receive you the message of the hour is to turn the faith of the children back to that which the apostolic fathers had so we're to go back to the original word the original seed go back into what they preach what the apostles and the prophets preached so if we have been turned back by the grace of god and our hearts have been turned back then the old time religion the effect that what they had when they received the holy ghost the effect that they had in the world in effect that the holy ghost in them and what the holy ghost did for them and did through them and in them that's what i said give me that old-time religion if you don't have it like that brother if you don't have the same spirit that they had i said the holy ghost that keeps you let's go back to the old path amen let's go back to the old way praise god well amen people that had it lived something now we got so many cry babies are you with me so many people talking about you know they can't live it no more so many people are failing to amen to be overcomers in this age i said give me that old-time religion praise god people can't take the word no more they don't want the word they want to do what they want and claim they believe the word they're just lying to themselves because people don't want see he said you've you're not talking to my prophets you're not talking to the preachers you're not listening to them you're doing what you want to do jeremiah was faced with the people doing what they want to do they said we will not and they rejected what jeremiah was telling them yet they was uh they wanted to bring these sweet-smelling uh incense before god and off of god all these sweet incenses from shebo i i mean and god said i don't want it he said i'm not going to accept your your sacrifices and and your sweet uh smelling incense i don't want it you know sometimes we think well lord i i'm not going to listen to amen the prophets and i'm not going to listen to the preacher and i'm not going to listen to your word but i'm going to give you this instead i'm going to give you sacrifices i'm going to give you an offering i'm going to give you this god said i don't want it i reject it y'all see what he was saying is it plain enough or is this something that i'm making up he said the watchman he said i set watchman over you saying hawking to the sound of the trumpet are you with me but they say we were not are you with me we were not hawking are you up man so we'll we'll we'll we'll land we're in a world where god said honking to the sign of the trumpet amen the people of not hark and god sent his servant in this hour and he spoke to the nation and spoke to the world and said hawking to the the word confirming the word with signs and wonders and miracles but that yet the world said we were not hawking america hasn't rejected the word but yet they said we offer you lord all the praises and all the glory but when it comes down to the word they rejected the very word are you with me many times even pastors in this age have a very difficult time because people would tell them no matter what the word said we were not hawking are you with me we have a rebellious group of people that are going to church and they want to serve god but they want to do what they want and jeremiah must have had a tough time you know the preachers did not agree with jeremiah because most of the preachers had uh they were taking a a a a little bit of money under the table and they were so worried about and so they they rejected jeremiah but jeremiah had thus said the lord he knew he knew where he was standing and he knew what god had said so here jeremiah says he says they have in the 14th verse they have also they have they have healed also the hurt of the daughters of my people what slightly amen yes it's a little healing but it's a slightly and you know people are satisfied with uh slightly being healed but not really being fully delivered a total deliverance they don't mind being delivered slightly or heal a little but they don't want total healing they don't mind having a little bit of victory but they don't want to be victoriously they don't want to really over the enemy they don't want the devil out fully and completely i don't want the devil in my life at all not at all are you with me the bible said don't give place to the devil amen shine the very appearance don't even let it look like the devil don't even let it appear that you're walking in oh hallelujah i believe we we try to get back and we satisfy ourselves instead of the conviction that a christian ought to have in their heart a sister a brother ought to walk with conviction amen walk with something that dawn in the inside god i'm convicted hallelujah oh walk with the fear of god in the heart praise god that god has done something down ain't been deep enough in the inside god i feel you god i love you and i respect you i respect you enough god that i just don't want amen i just don't want to just plot just walk you know how some folk just walk so close to the edge and all you got to do is just push them a little bit now they're all the way out i'ma tell you don't put your tent towards sodom for you end up in sodom a lot of times we we pitched our tent because the grass looked greener on the other side are you up man some folk amen and you know how many times i i i preach don't let the green grass fool you amen don't let the devil blind you with everything looking wonderful and lovely and you know you're out of the world of god and out of the will of god but yet the green grass fool you brother and sister amen it's better to be in the word amen praise god you know it was something about the children of israel they met when they had uh the ark of the covenant amen david wanted they wanted to bring it back and um so they found a way to bring the ark back and they put it on an ox car amen and sometimes i believe instead of the old time religion i believe we got the ox cut religion are you with me praise god you know they used to had to carry it on their backs and on the shoulders amen praise god maybe they said you know this thing is getting a little anger look you know little waiting a little testy they're carrying on my shoulder but if the art is carrying it i won't have no you know feeling in other words sometimes we try new stuff praise god and a lot of time we want to do something new are you with me and think that this new approach to the gospel this new approach to the word amen nobody tried it but amen god had an established way according to the word where the ark was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the priest are you with me but they thought they can do god of service without it being his will isn't that right but god was against that isn't that right cause those men to die are you with me brother and sister i only think when you try to do something outside of the will of god and outside of the world you're spiritually going to die for it you may not die in the physical right then but there'll be a physical death and a spiritual death because you're out of the will of god so brother and sister they tried to carry on the oxycontin i mean no no oscar let the ox look like everything's going well as well the ark is coming back and they all shot in the auctions returning but what happened it began to shake a little bit and they put their hands to it and die because god had an established way are you with me and i'm saying you know you know in prayer today it's something about bad new burden it's something like god wants you to the bad burden and the bible say bad you want another burdens amen we don't want to carry nothing amen i i i think it was difficult and it was a shame for mary to be impregnated and carrying a child and didn't even know a man but that was a thing that she had to shuffle are you with me she had to suffer the the the to be impregnated with the word amen you know when when people can be doing women can be doing all kind of thing but when they get pregnant sometimes if they were smoking or they were doing stuff drugs or anything sometimes they just quit because they don't want the baby to be affected and when you get impregnated with the holy ghost when you're carrying the word amen that means amen you cannot conduct yourself like one that does that don't have the holy ghost when you carrying amen jesus in you when you're travailing in to bring forth christ the word then you must understand amen that praise god i cannot do certain things that the rest of the world amen because i'm carrying the word in me praise god in the word amen praise god causing me to walk a certain way and you can't you know you you can't lift things like you used to live and you can't do things like you used to do and you can't drink things that you used to you can't oh hallelujah brother and sister because you got you're carrying the word they meant in the word amen that you are impregnated with the word with the with jesus on the inside and when jesus is on the inside jesus makes a difference in our lives amen the way we conduct ourselves because we got jesus on the inside so brother and sister how you conduct your life when you've got jesus on the inside it's a difference folks that ain't got jesus can do any kind of thing do what they want but when you've got the word amen you got to aim and realize if i'm gonna keep the word i don't want a spiritual abortion are you with me i don't want a spiritual abortion i don't wanna aim at the word amen hallelujah don't want to kill the word are you up some folk came at praise god they don't they don't want jesus they don't want to be impregnated with the word they amen they don't look the it ruins the figure oh god praise god they don't want to look holy they they don't want to walk holy that rules that figure amen i can't do what i want to do i have to be careful because i'm impregnated with the words jesus on the inside when jesus is on the inside brother and sister amen you got to conduct your lives different amen reason why folks conduct their lives like they conduct their lives there's no jesus there praise god and then and if they got jesus they don't mind getting a abortion well yes they don't mind getting an abortion they meant because they don't respect the life of god in them amen some folk came in they met said uh i don't want the i don't want this jesus oh yes so they don't mind amen trotting under the foot amen praise god they don't mind doing it they don't mind crucifying him afresh well oh yes sir they're crucified the very lord amen hallelujah tasted of the good word of god amen praise god and you don't want it you're tasted of the holy ghost your taste of all the power of god amen you know it's real meant they experienced eating the great sin amen they experienced that god amen it's a land that flows and milk and honey what amen they say we're not able to live the life amen we can't do it i don't i i can't do it brother and sister amen god didn't bring you this far to tell you what you can't do amen god brought you this far and he can take you on praise god he'll he'll give you victory over all your fears he made every demon and every devil that thank god hallelujah god is evil well yes brother sister you don't have to draw back praise god you don't have to be afraid praise god this is a holy way praise god but you have to go through a little pain a little suffering ain't meant because you can't put it on an ox cut are you what man and every woman knows that that sometimes they go through a lot of things when they're a man pregnant they have to go through certain things i don't know how i feel y'all know how i feel amen but i i can imagine that they feel different amen but i know how it feels to have the holy ghost and feel different praise god it's something you can't do with the holy ghost and they expect the holy ghost to still be there amen the holy ghost is still with if you're sitting around amen and you're having a pity party ain't meant for yourself and everybody doing this and doing that amen the holy ghost can't stay with that because the holy ghost you can't put it on an ox cut you got to go through some stuff amen you got to suffer some things you got to go through some pain and some sorrow praise god you got to eat something that you never thought you liked what the baby wanted ain't meant the word called for it oh you won't be so if the white calling for it i don't eat that but the word to eat it it's good for the baby amen praise god if you want christ to be born in you if you really want christ to come forward in his glory amen you got to go through some stuff if you really want to see god magnified in your life and you really want your light to really shine right you're going to have to go through some stuff oh lord i got to stop i just got started it's real sharp tonight god is good and i tell you we need the old-time religion are you with me i thought i would read those verses amen [Music] i said you know the devil won't go near and that's the reason people fear amen the devil don't like this not this gospel and the devil don't like you hallelujah the world i hate you the world don't love you let the world love you something wrong with you amen praise god you don't look like jesus you're not talking like jesus you're not walking like jesus that the world of his own if you're not of this world you from heaven amen praise god you got glory to god god has clothed you with his righteousness and with his glory you're not from this world don't expect this world and no wise ain't meant to love you and to treat you right praise god happier you when men persecute you and speak almighty evil against you falsely be happy when you quran complaining you at all have jesus on the inside praise god but when you got jesus you got to find a way to praise the lord find a way to thank the lord for victory thank you for lord god keeping me thank you for in the midst of what i'm going through i found a way to say thank you lord for this is good for me praise god whatever you do god i'm still saying the lord give it the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord god i love you anyhow praise god i know it working to my good i may not see it i mean i know right now but lord is working what am i good lord you doing it anyhow i said god will do it for you if you yield yourself if you surrender yourself if you give god that opportunity i know you've been healed slightly amen praise god i know your heart been healed slightly but you're not delivered you're not praise god totally healed amen praise god you got to be fully healed for he sent his word and it healed them god sent his word to heal you but don't reject the word but that's where your healing is that's where your deliverance is praise god y'all think this nation will receive the word thank the church well we received the word brother and sister if you got an ear to hear thank god to have an ear to hear amen you got a heart to receive the word brother and sister take hold of it receive the engrafted word amen is able to save your soul oh god got something in that word that amen praise god set a fiery in your life if you just take hold praise god hallelujah jeremiah might have looked a little difficult in that time because everybody else was saying peace and safety and all of the well but jeremiah had a message that the of repentance and folks didn't want to repent they didn't think they needed to repent they meant praise god but god looked after the abominations in which they were doing and jeremiah had to cry loud he told him despair not i want you to tell them what they're doing amen y'all wicked folk well they didn't want to hear them that they were a wicked and rebellious nation they didn't want to hear that no no we're good we're god's chosen hypo lord oh yes christian folk don't want to hear they meant god the judgment is hitting you and god's going to send judgment on you if you don't straighten your lives out god's going to send judgment praise god is on the way my brother is on the way sister and i believe the plagues are hitting the world and hitting america amen but men say we will not harken we will not repent matter of fact amen we're going to even make it worse we're going to do worse are you up there praise god as it is in the natural so it is in the spiritual brothers and sister where do we stand you'll see what's happening in the natural you'll see what's happening in the spiritual god bless you let us stand maybe i'm finishing another time but we're in a we're on a journey brother i didn't want to get down and down and personal i'm on that thing up there if i wasn't on that i probably would get a little but be on the internet and so i just can't get too far gone but by the grace of god i hope you get the message i hope you want that old-time religion i hope you want the old-time gospel they meant when you tell folk and they listen to you they'll save their soul amen they realize that you're telling them for their good telling them because you love them telling them amen because god shall repent are you with me i hope they understand this is the love of god through whom the lord loves you chasing trying to get you back to the old path the old-time religion where people got conviction in their heart i believe the reason why the children are not under conviction because the parents are not convicted praise god the parents won't they may repent no the children won't repent muscle was a rebellious time back then so it is today we need to come to repentance [Music] we're not going to get away from god god is going to bring judgment brother and sister where will you be standing in that day god bless you let us bow
