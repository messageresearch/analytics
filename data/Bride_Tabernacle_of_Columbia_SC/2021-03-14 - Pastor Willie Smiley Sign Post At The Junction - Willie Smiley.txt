morning how many on the expectation this morning hey man we could do a little bit better than that i think it's more than two or three gathered this morning and it's missed amen we appreciate the lord this morning we uh just appreciate this opportunity to be able to come up we came up with brother jack to be a part of the minister's meeting and we've had a wonderful time thus far and uh don't get a opportunity to get out that much so when we do you know especially with uh all that we've dealt with over the last year uh it's been difficult you kind of miss fellowship amen you kind of miss miss meetings and everything i i i i'm like i guess a lot of people be glad when i guess this thing is over with that we could get out and and fellowship with one another and uh you know no tent meetings and all that boy i tell you what it's been a hard year is that right but uh we we appreciate this opportunity this morning to be able to be with you all and um just uh the hospitality uh with brother simmons we've had a relationship over the years and so we appreciate being here i don't think i'm a stranger uh a stranger to anybody this morning so we we're not going to hold us this morning so let us just stand and uh we'll we'll read the scripture and we'll just see how the lord leads us this this morning um but we we appreciate the opportunity to be here and just uh remember brother jack and praise preacher for brother anderson this morning and uh pray for us after the services we're going to be heading back to florida so just pray for us it's been a kind of a long weekend we want to look in the book of acts chapter 2 and we'll read that and then i'll have you to be seated and then we'll go to the book of uh luke when you have it say man uh acts chapter 2 we want to start with the first verse it says and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a russian mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were uh were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was known abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and ma was saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here uh we every man in our own tongue when we were were born now let's maybe just skip down uh to the 12th verse and then it says and they were all amazed and were in doubt send one to another what meaneth this others mocking said these men are full of new wine but peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of jerusalem and all you that dwell at uh men of judah and all you that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose saying it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel uh let's just buy our heads and i have you to be seated after prayer we'll read another scripture this morning gracious father we just thank you once again for this opportunity to be in the house of the lord this morning and uh we just pray that you could move the human part to one side that uh we could uh just share something that we we trust that'll be uh edifying this morning and uh when it's all said and done we'd be so careful to give you the praise the glory and the honor for all things this morning in jesus christ wonderful name amen you may be seated now we want to maybe look in the book of saint luke chapter 17 and read a couple of verses out of there before we get started uh we want to start at the 26th verse and it says and as it were in the days of noah so shall it be uh in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until that day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they it they build but uh the same day that a lot went out of sodomy rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may the lord have a blessing to his word this morning we want to use as a little topic um this morning uh the signposts at the junction and um you know when you think about a junction i mean i quite sure a lot of us drive cars and sometimes you have to uh come to uh a stop sign and and when when you get there it really speaks of change it speaks of uh it brings you to a point where where you have to make a decision uh which direction you're going to go right you you just can't stay in one spot is that right amen you you got to make a decision whether i'm going straight whether i'm going to turn right whether i'm going to turn turn left but you it's you got to do something you you just can't remain in in that spot of people going to a man blow you off the uh stop sign you know because especially we we're living in an age where people are very very impatient right so so it really kind of speaks speaks of change uh we we read the book of acts this morning as as a just a foundational scripture uh and maybe we want to use as a little what mean if this uh one of the things i realized um we've been ministering quite a few years now uh uh and one of the things you you realize as a servant of god is that a lot of times things be happening spiritually right spiritually and scripturally and and and what what you find is is that people have no real clue of what's going on scripturally right people people you know i i found um where where people they go to church and we like to be excited and i enjoy being excited myself is that right i love i love good singing i love i love shouting i i like the emotional aspects of going to church but but i really i've realized something over the years in studying and ministering the word of god that that it's more to it than that because one of the things i realized we don't always feel good in the body right we in in our in our minds we don't always feel like jumping we don't always feel like shouting we don't always feel like running around and sometimes uh a sermon doesn't dictate that kind of atmosphere is that right but for me you you want to try to bring something that that stabilizes the people anchors of people and help the people to to really see what's going on around them is that right to me that's that's more important than a shout out because you can shout and be a hypocrite you can shout and be a devil is that right glory to god but i believe that that if if if you can get the people the word of god and anchor a man uh in their hearts that's the thing that'll bring about a chain is that right true true understanding right one of the things uh we've been taught is that revelation means more to us than anything is that right because without revelation you'll never even get the victory over the devil it's it's the revelation of the word of god that gives us the victory it's been the revelation amen of the word of god that has helped us in this season boy if it wasn't for revelation you know the scripture says we're living in a time in an hour where men's hearts will be failing them for fear right amen and and we could see with with everything that has gone on around us things that has taken place to bring about fear is that right amen but it's been the revelation of the word of god that has has anchored us here in the book of acts uh chapter two what what we find here is is that um um uh prophecy being fulfilled joel had prophesied this event that that the holy ghost not only that jesus when jesus actually came on the scene and and you know at the end part of his ministry with his disciples he said you know what uh in a little while the world won't see me no more but amen you see me for i'll be with you even in you right he he told them you know what i got to go away so that the comforter could come is that right you know that's important we people try to preach three guards if it was three guards in the godhead then jesus never really would have had to leave is that right why it's three of them the holy ghost a man would have just came and and and took his his his position but i mean it was just god changing his mask jesus says i got to go away that the comforter that christ could come amen and get in us and and do a work not not a no longer a one-man ministry but a a many member amen body is that right glory to his wonderful name now we can go in a lot of places there but but here um and i wanted to use this amen like i say because things can be going on around us and people don't have a clue people people kind of going on doing their thing living their own life their own these that you know their lifestyles and things of that nature with no clue scripturally i'll label on that for a second scripturally people don't have a clue amen what's going on scripture is being fulfilled and people just religious right people people just religious people going to church as tradition and things of that nature with no clear understanding that the prophecies of the scriptures is being fulfilled now here's joelle being a prophet because he amen amen he said surely i don't do nothing except i reveal it to my servants the prophets god anoints a man a man becomes the voice of god to the people he speaks he speaks a word amen in the name of god not his own agenda not his own thing he's be just the voice of god to the people because you know uh one time god spoke to the church and they said no no no no no no no no we don't want him to speak no more they came up to mount sinai he told moses to gather the people and he wanted to talk to him and he thundered down on the on the mountain and everything and it was like wait a minute it's just too much to handle is that right but the sovereignty of god said okay we'll i'll do it like this i'll use a man man has always been god's agent is that right and so god anoints amen um uh amos amen to speak a word of prophecy right amen and and here what we find is is that the prophecy i mean joel y'all forgive me on that one joel joel spoke concerning amen uh this event is that right and so uh uh at at a point jesus shut the ministry down and told him to go to amen uh to jerusalem and wait is that right tarry there you know no not not kind of like they teach it uh in in pentecost not not just being trying to be different but you know just to bring clarity i remember i remember just before i got saved i was kind of out in the world doing my thing on drugs and everything and uh but i was i was was going through some serious challenges and then i needed god and god directed me to this uh pentecostal church and not just to be critical so you know i want to say that but you know uh you don't want to lack understanding in this hour right uh uh one of the jobs of the holy ghost is to lead you and guide you into all truth and to show you things which are to come and so they had me i went in and they had me down on the altar some of y'all know what i'm talking about and those those those women and men they had me down there just calling on him call on him baby call on them jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus brother brother simmons probably know what i'm talking about he'll he's he's a little older so maybe our young folks don't know nothing about that but they would hit me on the back and i was calling on them but it was just something about it when i got up i realized i hadn't been changed i had i hadn't been changed in the scripture just said wait they didn't have to do anything right because it was a promise they just they just they just had to be patient and wait on god to come on the scene and do something is that right they didn't have to they didn't have to jesus jesus jesus they all they had to do is just stay there and wait for the fulfillment right of of the prophecy glory to his wonderful name so you can you can beat people maybe sometimes we ought to because it seemed like folk got more results back then almost than what we get now with all of the fullness of the word come on y'all y'all know me come on let's pull on the word of god how many had church vote up in here y'all don't work me too hard my god if if you understand it just say man i'm not gonna hurt you i ain't gonna be long neither uh but but um you know what what was happening was was was scripture being fulfilled prophecy of the scripture being fulfilled and and after these guys was filled man a bunch of a bunch of cowards that was locked up in a room scared of the councils and things of that nature now amen uh uh they they they come out they were anointed right they were they were equipped is that right because because there was a point where jesus shut him down he says peter when when you get converted right then you strengthen the brethren [Applause] he said you know after after the holy ghost come upon you you'll receive power right these guys when the holy ghost they had power to be a witness you can't witness christ without the power of the holy ghost in your life it's just intellectual is that right amen the gospel has got to be demonstrated people want to see god in action they saw god in action right they they you know they they heard the brethren was speaking in tongues and they were hearing and they they was watching you know uh the supernatural taking place things that was happening probably beyond anything that they had been taught come on y'all right anything that they would talk god does things beyond our intellectual thinking a lot of times god does things scripturally amen beyond the way sometimes we've been even taught sometimes even beyond theological perspectives right glory to god amen this was beyond theology right this this was the prophecy of the scripture being fulfilled and and and you know no doubt it was religious people in the crowd come on church folk way in the crowd probably dignitaries potent takes and everything in the crowd probably learned it men in the crowd scripturally probably men that had read them read the uh torah but but they they stood around and they said my looking at one another like but it's been this something that's beyond anything that that we've been taught right what they they they looked around and they had to ask ask themselves the question what mean if this right they had they had no understanding nobody in the crowd could interpret it for them right nobody around them a man could interpret it for him but amen uh peter right because the scripture says peter peter stood up because they they were saying you know what man these men drunk they had part truth right they had part two because they wasn't drunk but like peter said we ain't drunk like y'all suppose it's a little bit too early you know sometimes you know you get up early in the morning you're going on your way to work and you're going a little slow you're getting a little gas little coffee and sometimes you look over i look over and i'll be like it is 30 8 o'clock man you got a six pack already in your hand they ain't folk ain't he ate breakfast yet but peter says you know what this this this what's going on it's it's the fulfillment of of prophecy god anointed a man he spoke it now amen this is being fulfilled they had no clear-cut understanding about what was going on is that right but amen peter had the keys to the kingdom and it took it took peter amen to take the key and open the amen uh uh the door to the kingdom up to uh uh the predestinated because we we know that uh 3 000 men you know after peter got finished preaching they said man and brother what must we do to be saved but here's the thing uh why i wanted to draw our attention to that that scripturally things can be going on around us and and folk don't have no clear-cut understanding we we you know kind of go around like what mean is this and we we have all we have all of these questions but one of the things i realized amen if there's a bible question there's a bible answer see and and i thank god that the the ministry has taught us to follow scriptural prophecy right glory to god see that that i i want to say something church that's the only way that that will make it in this hour is is following the prophecies of the scriptures see when we follow the prophecies of the scripture and the promises of the word of god it takes away the fear come on because i i i know with with coving and everything who would ever thought not not now take this for what it is and i'm i'm not criticizing because uh at church we in church we got masks on too who would have ever thought that a year ago huh who who would have ever thought that right none of us i remember you know maybe a few years back you know you'll catch a glimpse of the news and and and you you'll see the chinese walking around with with mask on around the community now all over the entire world amen uh we we're we got mass not now hear me good cause i don't want to say that brother can't wait up here to get on us about our mass i'm all right with people wearing masks i wear a mask that's not what i'm saying but but but i'm going somewhere with that that thought right we thank god that god god gave us insight by prophecy by a seventh angel to show us that things was gonna come on the earth and how that men had broken uh see all this is these modern events is being made clear by prophecy right germ warfare was pathetically spoken and we probably sat around and we we would read different things and be like what and then when when things drop we was just like they were in acts 2. what mean is this what do you mean what mean is this we had we had the prophecy it had already been spoken we've quoted it we've preached it is that right and when it happened we were just like the brethren in the book of acts what mean if this oh my god covet and we almost allowed covet a man to dictate our every move to bring fear you know you know what i feel is ironic is we got enough faith to go to work with covey in the air but we ain't got enough faith harley to come to church with cove come on now come on now well i don't know pastor what do you mean you know when it's time to get up and go get that paycheck don't you the same faith it takes to go to work with it to go to walmart to go to the restaurant to go shop we could do everything now i'm gonna say this now all right i ain't gonna take this back i'm gonna let this fly we got faith enough to do all kind of things but folk ain't holly got faith enough to go to church i know even in florida uh it's it's churches that ain't even you know uh uh open up because of the fear not realizing we got a scriptural promise he said he heals all diseases is that right we sometimes i think we forget amen that he shed blood is that right glory to god but we got faith to do all kinds of things shame on people same old folk that can go to work can go to walmart and rub elbows with with folk and go shopping and buying this and doing that and ain't got faith to come back to church glory to god hallelujah then the glory right you know i had i had um when the thing first came out man i found myself you know on a daily basis four or five times googling this and that about the code but i got to the place something within me like man leave that thing alone that stuff gonna drive you crazy statistics and this and that and ever the god that brought you here is gonna take care of you right i i thank god we we had we had a prophet to come on the scene and say you know what amen the devil can't take you to god get finished with you amen so it the word was the thing that has taken the fear i'm a realistic person i know it's real folk folk don't die i understand that but i'm depending on god to take care of me glory to god glory to god i'm dependent on god be cautious do do what you got to do is that right that's that ain't you know okay do what you're supposed to do wash your hands wear your man but trust in god is that right well let me move on from that right what what what mean if this right amen when we see these things we got to be able to go back to the world right go back to that's why the bible says studies showed ourself approved right if we study the word we we will see things in the word that has indicated to us the things amen uh that that will come on the earth we know scripturally the the the lid of hell right hell is on the earth come on now preach with somebody hell is on the earth every everything that from from from the very genesis of the bible has been amen condensed down into this age every spirit every kind of demon everything that's been turned loose right but it's these things is only a signpost right you know the scripture says when you start seeing these things to look up see it's when when we see see and this is why we read um um luke 17 right we what was then is now we could see what jesus spoke taking place now right and luke 17 jesus told them right amen you'll see the days of noah right in the end time we we we've arrived i'm not looking for luke 17 to be fulfilled luke 17 it's been fulfilled eating and drinking and folk marrying and giving them marriage folk getting married can't stay married three weeks [Music] oh y'all gotta preach with me this morning it's the spirit of the age is that right marriage and giving in marriage see amen but by studying you understand you know what in the age that i'm living in there's there's a spirit that in you know this layout of cnas that that we're fighting the enemy is fighting marriages like never before preachers marriages deacons marriages and and everybody else marriage it's a spirit that's trying to bust up families is that right to break the oneness in the home to spirits trying to break the oneness in the church oh you come on now what's then is now we could look back amen to genesis in the garden of eden right the the first church amen glory to god the first church with adam and eve the first family the first represent representation of of of the mind of god and and and what we we we find is is that the enemy right satan comes into the church satan comes into the home right glory to god he he anoints the woman the weaker vessel come on i know y'all strong black women you you you could be strong and be dainty too you ain't got to be a pushover but you just got to know your place when when when he fell because a man uh uh she lost the perspective of her role if if when the serpent came she would have went to adam initially i'm gonna i'm gonna dwell on this for a second and i'm gonna move on one of the things i find like i say i've passed to the church for 23 years and one of the things i found was that um um people when the enemy comes they don't come to the pastor right sometimes sometimes we fail to realize that you know the pastor is is is the watchman he's the shepherd he's he's he's the the the god of the sheep he's the door i mean right he he's multifunctional but we we we try to do things because a lot of times folk think that they got most sense and that they smarter than the pastor you not intellectually a lot of times you might be but spiritually he's anointed the the prophet said that he's ordained the legion he's ordained if he's a god-called man he's ordained to lead you through glory to god he's just not just not some fixture right no he's gifted a lot of times you know i found in in the past they come you know uh uh brother smiley uh um you know i stuttered it out really you did what was the conclusion you came up with well and you just be sitting back there yeah you so far off the word it's it's not funny is that right then amen you could see it when they come from under the umbrella of the word of god you give them six months life wrecked up families tore up is that right amen listen listen god you know what you're here because god placed you here you got you got to know that brother simmons is your your pastor is that right amen glory to god you that's something that amen that's got to be revealed just like the new birth has got to be a revelation to you amen your pastor has got to be a revelation is that right amen and when when that's the case you know when he do things that maybe you don't like you don't go running off somewhere y'all gotta talk to me now i've been pastored i pastored for 23 years i'm not pastoring it anymore but i passed it for 23 years so amen i'm not going to approach it evangelistical i'm multi talented right we got insight see if people do things come god's provided way people people come to junctions right and and don't know which way to turn they turn away from amen the scripture because when you turn away from the shepherd you turn away from the scripture because god's got a provided way come on y'all god's got a provided way glory to god amen the devil is slime slick when he went to eve he was smooth when he got to talking to eve he was smooth oh girl you won't fully surely die come on now i know that pastor adam told you that but listen let me let me drop something on you that that you know adam didn't tell you amen god listen god know the day that you eat from this tree you'll be wise you'll be smart you'll know man you're no good for me what and adam didn't tell me that no i didn't tell you that because that was death to eat from that tree he told you don't do it don't partake of it is that right god gives us revelation when it's needed right amen but amen she didn't come god provided weight she didn't go to a husband her thinking changed from the original revelation of the word of god that's why the church is in the condition that it's in and that's why we needed a mouthpiece in this hour to bring us back to the bible i thank god god sent us an angel glory to god and that angel couldn't come unless there was scripture to bring him is that right oh glory to god malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 right glory to god right why be because people turn from the word and brought a man their own way of thinking eve eve thinking changed right and when her thinking changed she no longer believe the message come on she know she and and and and when she didn't believe the message look at the damage that it caused it broke up adam never argued with eve until her thinking changed right why they were in a witness they were in an order there was that was a respect that was a love is that right glory to god but that was broken the fellowship was broken the fellowship with god was broken glory to god god come down you know it wasn't like he didn't know where adam was that wasn't even it but he realized you know what adam revelation had changed huh adam adam well yeah well you really want to know him over here in these bushes what are you doing over there um huh well i i'm naked where will you get that revelation from there was a spiritual veil over adam's eyes where where where him and eve could walk amen in the garden didn't even realize right but when that perspective to the message changed right amen they their eyes came open then now they're like wait a minute something changed here instantly adam tried to do something within himself right he tried to put work into sawing a fig leaf uh apron around you know i mean he tried to put in work his own way of thinking right amen he forfeited the abstract title deed is that right see when he when he had the abstract title deed he could name he could speak he could say he was amen the god of the earth he was given dominion now he forfeited it for amen each revelation like lord eve what you did glory to god he loved him he loved him i mean he crossed over the word of god right he stepped over the chasm and then had no way back on his own come on right i know no folks think well he took even you know look adam adam once adam fell adam could not redeem eve adam needed redeeming himself now he tried to figure it out with the fig leaves trying to all make a denomination didn't work amen he knew he knew that when god came down there was something in him like this is not going to be accepted by god is that right this is not going to be accepted by god no denomination is accepted by god because it's not amen in the principles of the word right god never created right not one denomination come on preach with me all that amen god knew it would be but it it was all outside of the realms of the word of god right amen that's why we needed a voice to bring us back to the bible glory to god because because when you create these things then you you got men and and and emotions and feelings and you get a lot of nonsense hockeys and and all of that kind of stuff right glory to god god's when god's provided way is amen under the new testament church he placed a fivefold ministry there right amen the shepherds and you know the prophet the evangelists the teachers and all of that but amen all of them are under the umbrellas of the holy ghost the leader of the holy ghost right amen the mouthpiece of god they speak for god is that right glory to god it ain't about it ain't about me being you know a bigger man than brother simmons that's nonsense right because because a real great man will make another man feel like he's the big man [Music] come on glory to god glory to god sometimes you go to meetings and it's like i just sit back and just like whatever you know y'all y'all might feel like y'all bigger and and no more than brother smiley and you might i'm fine with that but one thing i do know when when i get this microphone in my hand and i get smiley out of the way god can preach god can't i ain't much of a preacher but god can preach right but but eve had to make a choice one of the things that they didn't understand oh my god it's almost 12 o'clock oh i don't gotta anoint it jesus y'all giving about 15 more i got 15 minutes in me but the thing but the thing that they didn't understand amen in acts chapter 2 they were at a junction right and they had to make to make decisions right because they was they was coming from under the law and going into grace if they were they were they were at a a a point where where you're going to either go forward with present-day light right or stay in darkness right see if if you if you want to be fed watch this amen you got to constantly move with god see god fed the prophet by the brook sheriff he sustained them there but but the prophet came to a junction right and god says listen now now you can stay there and die come on oh you can go over here i got a woman over there she may not know it yet but i got a woman over there amen with something that will sustain you and when when the prophet got there you know that that day and and and he he met the woman and she was getting ready to you know make a last look uh uh uh a cake and and all that and in her mind you know she said well we remember somebody he'll eat this and you know whatever happened and that's it that's a wrap a bit of famine in the land and about like it is now but thank god for predestination is that right thank god for predestination amen god god sent her a man a prophet huh amen god sent her a prophet an elijah told him to give us some water she was like i'm fine with that praise god i'll go and get you some water she knew what a little water was she was she wasn't wrestling with him over no water she had you know she knew to wear a little bit of water you know i get your old drink and he stopped hey hey why you at it gone gone gonna make me a cake uh uh whoo that that that would probably that it was a hard one she got the talking then well sir um you know i just got a just enough you know to make a little cake for me and and my son and and and but this is what you do get after me make me one first bring that to me and and the crews are all won't go go go dry the you'll have meal you'll you'll eat right because god was gonna use her to sustain amen the prophet just like he did by the bro you know what sometimes i think i i think about i you know one day i was preaching kind of on these lines and i started thinking about you know um the raven and the nature you got to think about some things sometimes how supernatural that was now i don't really know whether it was cooked or not cooked it don't matter because i believe he was able to build a fine cook right but to think the nature of a wild animal like that would would be to devour come on a raven it's like boy i can imagine being selfish like well it got me something to eat well no but god placed it in the raven don't you eat that yeah the supernatural god is a supernatural god take that to the man of god oh i started thinking about that one day i'm like you that's a powerful thought to think the nature of that the raven right and that that that he will be submissive come on now oh glory to god look we we supposed to lord i feel something now we supposed to be the highest life form that god made the highest form of intelligence is man and we're more disobedient than animals sometimes [Applause] you could train dogs to roll over junk to sit and stay or whatever sometimes you you can't seem like you can't get nothing involved right we got more work than we've ever had i'm just saying this right i don't know i don't really know y'all i know y'all but i don't know you because i don't live here i see y'all when i see y'all right brother brother simmers know y'all i don't really know y'all i know you but i don't know yet i ain't passing you right but sometimes you you find now nowadays especially with all of the word and intelligence and education we're less submissive come on we're less submissive to authority children less submissive to depend well i'm smarter than them but you dumber than them you intellectually most smart right but you do things that they wouldn't do come on you do things that they wouldn't do right the age of disrespect but all of these things is just a signpost amen of where we act right it's a signpost of where we are right it's it's indicating when we see the days of noah when we see all of
