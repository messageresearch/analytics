in jesus name bless the word tonight bless thee that are gathered here and those that are listening bless those in trump the lord and those [Music] colombian roundabouts blessed little flock knows that a sick [Music] confident heart and lord may they be healed in jesus name amen the book of revelation 21 didn't know what to say i said i wasn't going to send out an announcement that we was not having service and i wasn't gonna send out one that we was gonna have i said until brother jeremiah i said those that come show welcome to come i said right now i'm just praying we know that the numbers are increasing as far as the pandemic i wouldn't want to be responsible for putting anybody in harm's way so i said be led by the spirit we thank you for being extra cautious because in a time like these you can't be too careful so i said to you thank you for your cooperation thank you for your support those that want to press their way feel free to press your way i thought between brother jeremiah and brother earnest one of them was going to take it tonight but i was prepared so god bless you thank you since i didn't say anything he's probably confused them god is good amen revelation 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven in the first earth was passed away and there were no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared at the bride of dawn for her husband may god bless you towards you may be seated i like to look at this verse says a bride a dawn for her husband we say we are not in layout of seal which is the seventh church age but we're in the broad age we say the church ages comes to the end in revelation 3 in revelation 4 he says to the bride to come up here so we escape lay out the seal and we come up into the bride age so we come out of laodicea and we come into christ who is the word are you with me so we want to talk about the bride adorning for her husband very important because in this age there's a contrast the bride has an endowment that is expected of her a husband wants to see her are tied a certain way and dressed a certain way you know it's something to come to the wedding into the marriage and you still got your rollers in your hair maybe you got your work clothes on that means you didn't come to be married because you did not dress for a wedding are you with me the contrast here is revelation 17. in other words john said i saw this new jerusalem prepared as a bride of dawn for a husband we look at three things deprived the bride a dawn husband so we want to put emphasis on three things today the bride husband and adon here it says in revelation 17 it shows not the bride but it shows the contrast chosen harlot and the hollard she is adorning herself for her husband and her husband is satan are you with me so here in revelation 17 he says and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vows to talk with me saying to me come here and i will show thee the judgment of the great what poor that set upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and in the habits of the earth has been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so this is the bride of jesus christ the bride that's a dawn for her husband paul says i expose you to one husband but this woman here is a and she's a fornicator it says with whom the kings of the earth has committed fornication so he carried me away unto the spirit until the wilderness and i saw a woman set upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemous having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colors decked with gold precious stones pearls and having a golden cup and a handful of abomination and the filthiness of her fornication and upon her name written mystery what and we know babylon was was that great city the never canal zoo it was a beautiful city it was a great city but the bible depicts her as babylon the great the mother of hollows and abomination of the earth we know that mr babylon is a city also and we realized that that that's where rome sits city on seven hills because he said the seven heads with our swords are the seven mountains in which the horde set it the whole represent the church are you with me so we realize that there's a church that he calls unhollowed sets upon many waters or waters represent people multitudes nations and tongues so we understand that it's deck with purple gold and precious stones we understand that so we understand that this woman which is type of the false church which produces daughters and we don't want to go in detail right now because we want to talk about the bride adorned for her husband we know that the false church we'll add to the word take away from the word and she'll have a lot of creeds and dogmas outside of the word and people will obey the wishes as it was in the old testament jezebel and atelier jezebel had a daughter named atelia so as it was an old in shadow form so it is in reality form as we see today brother and sister one day she'll raise her ugly head again but there must be a spirit that causes jezebel to be thrown out to wander like jehu that's anointing that exposes jezebel and her prophets baal so that was why elijah the prophet identifies who jezebel was and the same spirit of elijah would not identify who mystery babylon is so by the grace of god god has identified to you and i in this age that we might not be ignorant of satan devices and understand that we rather not against flesh and blood but against organized principalities and powers against the rulers of darkness of this world and we must be well equipped and well prepared amen to fight the good fight of faith that we might lay hold on eternal life we must put on the whole arm of god we must be adorned properly and knowing who we are adorning ourselves to meet the bridegroom are you with me it was very important as there were ten versions five are wise and father foolish it was very important that we had all it was very important that they were virgins they must be clean it's very important to you and i that if we're to marry christ then we must be clean we must be pure so revelation 17 depicts this unclean woman brothers and sisters i i i don't think it matters to some folks how they look when they go to meet god but it doesn't matter to the bride of jesus christ she must make sure and certain that she has on the prophet garment because remember one came in and didn't have a wedding coming on and they were just invited to the wedding and he said friend how did you get here so your garment and your adornment amen it's got to be right you must know what you ought to be dressed in let's go back to revelation 21 and let's look again and i'll try to just get started for a moment [Music] i think my best way of teaching is illustrating and i said i would have to do all kind of charts in order for you to see the clear picture but by the grace of god we must expect to see a clear picture of what god is requiring and what god wants about us see because we don't know what he wants then how can we know the bible said how can we heal without a preacher and how can he preach except he'd be sin or you would be and the bible says in the name of three seven shooters the lord god would do nothing but he reveals the secrets to serving the prophet so god amen sends us he meant a word of wisdom that we might be clothed and that we might not be found naked are you with me so god knows that the people would need the revealed word of the owl are you with me so the vibe will recognize your husband who he is are you up man so revelation 21 again it says in the second verse he says and i saw the holy city now we realize that mr babylon is a city too but i saw the holy city new jerusalem now you notice as we said in time past that the city is holy and the bible tells us that you are a city that sits on a hill that cannot be here amen let your light shine that men shall see your good works and glorify your father which is them are you with me so you are to be holy he said be holy because i am what holy and you're a city that sits on here that cannot be heard isn't that right so we must understand that as it is there will be a city but you must understand that god is expecting if any man be in christ jesus he is a new creature you must become a new creation anew amen and because amen you are the lights of the world or you would be so you light up in this dark evil wicked world god amen puts his light with the inside of you and you to shine are you with me and brother and sister if god puts his light in you you don't put it on the bushel praise god and i'm i'm so glad that you know the word of god is a laughing to my feet and light to my path if you've got the word of god in you it'll light you up they meant for it's like fire you shut up in my bone [Music] they meant the word of god amen would do something down in the inside it'll bring changes amen praise god i ain't got time i look like i'm gonna dub in the sunday morning before i get there but it's kind of difficult to hold back [Music] amen so by the grace of god i want you to know that the word amen of god amen it does something to you because you that amen the the bride let me just i i just go on and try to move on revelation 19 7 excuse me it says he said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his what his wife has made herself what okay so must make yourself ready how do you make yourself for and and to her was what was granted that she should be what i'm gonna tell you something amen you cannot get this fine linen in any kind of way in any way you can go to all joanne's and all you can go to all the club stores and try to find your nice wedding gum and all the marriage places in the brightest places and try to find you a nice garment to put on that you can meet christ in none of that works amen you can go to this church and that church into this preaching that preacher none of that works are you with me see sometimes we think we can meet christ and amen so we uh uh some preacher would give us a garment some church would give us a guard said why this and you'll be ready to meet the bridegroom no no brother sister that won't work amen you'll never pass the test when he see you were done a certain way he know that you're none of his are you with me but if you're done yourself the way he said brother and sister you will never be able to attain it you'll never be able to achieve it you cannot buy this garment with all the gold that the world got amen all the billions billionaires cannot get this garment amen they don't have the money to buy this one because money can not bite so he says arrayed with fine and clean and what clean and white praise god it's clean and it's white praise god hallelujah i believe that kind of garment that they won the mountain transfiguration and they saw amen uh jesus and moses and their lions and their garments shine like light are you with me praise god i believe it's so holy and so pure amen praise god i know jesus amen when saul of tashas met jesus he said it was brighter than the noonday sun someone bright that it blindness praise god the natural man amen oh lord but by the grace of god here we are amen white the fine linen is the what the righteousness of the why okay let's go in contrast isaiah 64 here isaiah 64 and 6. isaiah 64 and 6. see because some some folk think amen that they're going to make it it doesn't matter with you know what what i wear it doesn't matter how i dress how i adorn myself amen god is not looking on the outside he looking on the inside amen it's just you know we can take that and and twist it and say what we want to say are you would be but we must dawn ourselves as the bride of jesus christ for our husband and i believe that we will in the physical realm because the natural tights the spiritual i believe we'll find ourselves adorning ourselves amen with sobriety and with holiness and with godliness are you with me i believe we'll find ourselves as as the bride of christ with shame faithfulness he said not but pearl a cold a costly array are you with me we won't worry about amen all of these things are decorated things that the world has to offer and that they have to put on they meant to dawn themselves such as jezebel had to paint a face amen because she was going to meet jehu amen and the prophet god said when you paint your face that means you decline wall are you with me jezebel amen she's gonna meet amen praise god her doom amen jehu amen praise god say who's on the lord's side are you with me when we on the lord's side jezebel is not amen going to rule you in not as a son or a god and not as the daughter of god you're not going to be wooed in amen you know amen that god had beautified the meek with salvation are you with me you know how you dawn yourself but if you amen praise god if you are of the world amen you amen will be caught up in the worldly things but we are not of this world amen god amen amen has attained you and i before the foundation of the world that we might be holy and without blame in him in love are you with me god has called you to a heart calling brother a heart calling sister amen 64 and 6. he says but we are all as unclean things and all our righteousness is as to what but here in revelation 19 it says the white linen is the righteousness of the saints where did we get it from bro brother and sister when we arrayed and dawn ourselves in a white linen and it is the righteousness of the saints where did we get our righteousness from what he says here but we all are unclean things and all our righteousness is filthy rights and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away and there's none that call upon the name that stirs himself to take hold of thee for thou has heard thy faith from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities but he says but now lord thou are our father and we are the clay and they are the potter and we are all the works of thy hand are you with me somebody said lord moment make me what you want me to be amen paul said the potter has power over the clay to make a vessel to honor and a vested dishonor he said it not him that will it to him that run it but it's god that shows mercy aren't you glad for the mercy of god meant praise god if it by any means they meant that we all oh all our righteousness is filthy rags and we are so unclean amen but we must have it meant the righteousness of god where did we get it from second corinthians 5. i thank god that god made a way for you and i amen god made a way for his bride that she might be a dawn properly amen you can't get around it amen it's only it's god provision for you and i it's not what we have done is what he's done for us he said it was granted into her that she might be a read god has granted amen unto us that we might be a raise amen praise god god has granted us a god wedding garment in this age amen i'm glad that god has granted us a garment amen god has given you and i a man a garment a wedding garment that we can be clothed in in this age praise god hallelujah i'm glad that we might be clothed upon and that we might not be found naked praise god eve was found neck and adam was found naked but you won't be found naked praise god hallelujah i thank god hallelujah that you might be clothed upon amen with your house that came from heaven amen said here in ii corinthians 5 he says for he has made him 21 excuse me for he had made him to be sin for us for he has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be what made the righteousness of god god amen that we might be made the righteousness of god in him thank god that god makes us his righteousness and that is in christ jesus for by one spirit are we baptized into one body and that's by christ jesus that he makes us the righteousness of god now who's who's doing this the bride of dawn for her husband who's our husband isaiah 54
