[34:03] brother sister we are the finishing line
[34:09] this is the last
[34:12] it says here now faith is the substance
[34:16] of things hoped for it is
[34:17] evidence of things not seen for by it
[34:20] the elders attain a good report through
[34:23] faith we understand that the worlds were
[34:25] framed
[34:26] by the word of god so that the things
[34:29] which are
[34:29] seen were not made of the things which
[34:33] do appear
[34:34] by faith abra offered a more
[34:37] to god a more excellent sacrifice than
[34:41] cain and by which he attained
[34:44] witness that he was righteous god
[34:47] testified
[34:48] of his gift and by it he been
[34:52] yet dead yet spake
[34:55] by faith enoch was translated that he
[34:58] should not see them
[35:00] and was not found because
[35:03] god had translated him for before
[35:07] his translation he had this testimony
[35:11] that he pleased god may god bless the
[35:13] reader of the word you may be seated
[35:17] we want to talk this morning because
[35:19] it's very prevalent
[35:21] we should be anticipating something that
[35:23] happened and
[35:24] something spectacular so much and so in
[35:27] the days of jesus christ when he came in
[35:29] the flesh
[35:30] as emmanuel which was god being
[35:33] interpreted god with us
[35:34] there was a manifestation of the uh uh
[35:38] it was an anticipation that the messiah
[35:40] would come
[35:41] even the woman at the well which was uh
[35:43] you know samaritan she said we know
[35:45] that when the messiah come he'll do
[35:47] these things
[35:48] they were in they knew the season and
[35:51] the time that they were living in
[35:54] and uh the season and the time the bible
[35:56] says no man know the day that our
[35:59] but he said the season and time we know
[36:01] amen
[36:02] so we're talking about rapturing faith
[36:04] now let's go to thessalonians
[36:07] 5 and he said but the time and the
[36:10] season brethren uh you have
[36:14] first thessalonians five and one but the
[36:17] times
[36:18] in the season brethren you have
[36:21] no need that i write unto you for
[36:23] yourself what
[36:25] yourself know what perfectly
[36:29] first thessalonians 5 and 2 for
[36:32] yourselves
[36:33] know what perfectly that the day
[36:37] of the lord so cometh as a what
[36:40] thief in the night we know that judgment
[36:42] is striking the earth
[36:44] right now through the hurricanes to the
[36:47] earthquake
[36:47] all the different turmoils that are
[36:50] happening through the covet and all
[36:52] we know the judgment in the day of the
[36:54] lord is right at hand
[36:56] the manifestation of sodom and gomorrah
[36:59] amen is getting the word the the
[37:02] the world is getting into fire condition
[37:06] burning condition because he said as it
[37:09] was in the days of noah
[37:10] and as it was in the days of sodom thus
[37:13] shall it be in the day when the son of
[37:14] man
[37:15] so it's a son of man ministry hidden
[37:18] there amen
[37:19] it's it's a son of man ministry but it's
[37:22] going to be like the days of noah
[37:24] and the days of lot amen for the son of
[37:28] man to be revealed
[37:29] isn't that right so uh as luke 17 30 and
[37:33] so forth
[37:34] uh let's look at where we're at the
[37:37] signs of the time
[37:38] and we'll be able to amen if we can
[37:41] discern the face of the sky and say it's
[37:43] far weather
[37:44] how can we can he jesus said how can we
[37:46] not
[37:47] discern the signs of the time we know
[37:50] that the signs are here
[37:51] and it's telling us what time it is it's
[37:53] time for the judgment
[37:55] it's time amen that god's going to judge
[37:58] this world
[37:59] amen now the world has to get inside on
[38:02] the condition
[38:03] to fulfill amen the son of man ministry
[38:06] must be
[38:07] must come at the same time because he
[38:09] said
[38:10] he said as it was in the days of knowing
[38:12] as it was the days of the lord
[38:14] thus shall be in the day when the son of
[38:16] man shall be revealed isn't that right
[38:19] so we're wondering why all these things
[38:22] are happening like it's happening
[38:24] amen they have to happen this way
[38:27] they meant to get you in rapture and
[38:29] condition amen
[38:31] you amen ought to be elevated and raised
[38:35] up
[38:35] and in anticipation that we are in amen
[38:38] this uh
[38:40] cycle of time and we're in amen this
[38:43] particular
[38:44] amend cycle that we should be
[38:46] anticipating
[38:48] amen the coming of the lord and
[38:51] believe me brother when i say wrapped in
[38:53] faith we know
[38:54] it's just not mechanics but it has to be
[38:57] mechanics and dynamics amen
[38:59] it's not just a letter but it might it
[39:01] have to be the spirit to quicken the
[39:03] word and bring the word to life amen
[39:06] so we have to have something that come
[39:09] forth from the lord
[39:10] to bring us into rapture and condition
[39:14] amen and so amen the purpose of
[39:17] amen might account for was to bring the
[39:20] bride in rapture to condition amen
[39:22] to bring us back to the faith that was
[39:24] once delivered unto the apostolic
[39:26] fathers amen
[39:28] god will restore the years that they
[39:31] can't go on the prominent one locals in
[39:32] the caterpillar eaten
[39:34] god said i will restore amen and then
[39:37] hosea said after two days he will revive
[39:39] us amen god has given and revived us
[39:43] amen but we must come amen to fool
[39:46] amen a revelation amen that we might
[39:50] become
[39:51] in full manifestation of what god
[39:54] promised the bride
[39:55] and the church would be in this hour
[39:58] amen
[39:59] amen if there was an elijah then as i
[40:02] was talking to brother gavin this
[40:03] morning from england
[40:05] they said if there was an elijah then
[40:07] there must be
[40:08] an elisha amen with the double potion
[40:11] somewhere it meant because amen and if
[40:14] that devil potion
[40:16] is available amen then we ought to be
[40:19] in that condition that we can take the
[40:21] same manner
[40:22] and we can go back and smoke jordan amen
[40:27] don't just talk about elijah ministry
[40:29] amen
[40:31] but because elisha had amen his ministry
[40:35] amen
[40:35] that he was the continuation amen
[40:38] of elijah's ministry so we're to
[40:41] continue what christ
[40:42] was doing amen so brother and sister we
[40:45] must
[40:46] understand that we too are expected
[40:50] amen to prophesied again and
[40:53] that there'll be a real manifestation of
[40:55] the power of god
[40:57] in our lives are you with me
[41:00] because if we are not expecting nothing
[41:03] we won't get anything amen we understand
[41:06] by
[41:07] faith enoch was what translated amen
[41:11] and faith come by what here
[41:14] so there must be a word amen
[41:18] and hearing by the word of god so there
[41:20] must be a word that come forth
[41:22] from the lord that would give rapture in
[41:25] faith
[41:26] amen and that was the purpose of the
[41:28] word for the hour
[41:30] to give rapture and faith
[41:34] amen and see when we got it we don't
[41:37] have to talk about it
[41:38] but there must be a manifestation
[41:42] amen praise god you don't have to amen
[41:45] uh i'll say a virgin shall concede and
[41:48] quote the scripture
[41:50] for mary was the manifestation of isaiah
[41:53] 7 14. amen she wasn't repeating and
[41:57] quoting
[41:57] amen isaiah 7 14 she was
[42:00] manifesting isaiah 7 14 a virgin shall
[42:04] concede
[42:05] that had happened to her and she was
[42:07] impregnated with the word
[42:09] and she was bringing forth a messiah in
[42:12] that day
[42:14] jesus christ the son of god are you a
[42:17] man
[42:18] so you and i amen we don't have to talk
[42:21] about what god is
[42:23] going to do amen i i i i wrote down
[42:27] something while i was praying
[42:28] amen jesus christ and i thought i uh
[42:31] speak
[42:31] on jesus christ the same yesterday today
[42:34] and i wanted to talk about today
[42:37] amen jesus christ today that's
[42:40] hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[42:42] yesterday and today and forever but i
[42:44] want to talk about today
[42:47] is he the same today and if he is the
[42:49] same today
[42:50] amen then amen what he did then he would
[42:53] be doing now
[42:54] in our lives and if he's not doing that
[42:58] we ought to be crying not to god you
[43:00] promised lord
[43:02] yeah amen we are the promised word for
[43:04] the hour but if we are the promised word
[43:06] for the hour
[43:07] then where's the manifestation amen and
[43:10] where is the god of elijah
[43:12] amen praise god then somebody ought to
[43:15] testify the god of elijah
[43:17] is with elisha amen somebody ought to
[43:20] recognize that the god
[43:22] they met praise god of molecular for
[43:25] amen is
[43:26] wealth amen the hearts being turned back
[43:28] to the faith of the apostolic father
[43:30] and they're producing the same works
[43:34] they meant the works that i do jesus
[43:36] said shall you do also and greater works
[43:38] in these shall he do
[43:40] because i go to my father and if the
[43:42] greater works are working themselves out
[43:45] to you
[43:45] then somebody ought to recognize amen
[43:48] these men are eagerly learned but
[43:50] they've been with jesus
[43:52] amen you got to amen have a real
[43:54] relationship
[43:55] they meant that you got to have in real
[43:57] revelation to bring forth manifestation
[44:01] brother and sister there got to be
[44:03] something that give us
[44:04] rapture in faith amen not just sitting
[44:07] around
[44:08] amen and reminiscing and
[44:11] and thinking that all is well but we got
[44:13] to have the real
[44:14] power in our lives it's got to be a real
[44:17] genuine stir
[44:19] amen there's got to be something that's
[44:21] quicker than us
[44:22] amen calling us ain't meant to meet the
[44:24] challenge of the hour
[44:26] amen and we're being challenged today
[44:28] amen with this covet and everything else
[44:31] that's coming on the earth
[44:32] we're being challenged today and and as
[44:36] amen we got to go out and meet the
[44:38] goliath of the hour we got to go out and
[44:40] meet the challenges of the day
[44:42] we got to go and smite y'all and like
[44:44] elisha did
[44:46] are you with me so jordan won't stand in
[44:50] our way
[44:51] amen we can pardon jordan amen
[44:54] so brother and sister it's not something
[44:56] that we're just preaching about and
[44:58] getting excited
[44:59] because somebody's saying that amen but
[45:02] there must be a manifestation and a
[45:03] demonstration
[45:04] of the power of god in our lives and we
[45:07] must seek god's face
[45:08] and we must pray until something
[45:11] happened to change our very
[45:13] amen attitude about the word amen
[45:16] because the right mental attitude about
[45:19] the word will bring him on the scene
[45:22] amen and it'll bring
[45:23] forth manifestation amen you'll see
[45:26] amen not just mechanics but you'll see
[45:29] dynamics
[45:30] amen
[45:33] so brother and sister don't let me get
[45:35] too excited let me calm down a minute
[45:38] amen
[45:39] but i hope something that would sink in
[45:41] so i don't want to just
[45:42] preach to you i want to talk to you
[45:44] today amen that something might shrink
[45:46] down in your spirit and in your soul
[45:49] something that would grab a hold that
[45:50] caused an urgency about
[45:52] amen the word of god so there must be
[45:56] faith for healing amen uh so uh
[45:59] sometimes we preach about divine healing
[46:01] with the stripes we are healed
[46:03] but we got to uh amen uh uh the purpose
[46:06] amen
[46:07] uh of of all the silence in heaven you
[46:10] know
[46:12] and the purpose of the seven seals amen
[46:15] they said seven thunders out of their
[46:16] voices and i was about to write
[46:18] amen praise god he said to john seal up
[46:21] the sand with the seven thunders other
[46:22] than write them not but in the days of
[46:24] the voice of the seven angel when he
[46:26] shall begin to sound
[46:27] then the mysteries of god shall be
[46:29] finished amen what was the thunder's
[46:31] other not the mysteries amen
[46:33] we believe that it's the coming of the
[46:34] lord isn't that right and it
[46:36] is the coming of the lord there must be
[46:38] surgeon of the holy ghost
[46:39] to search us with an anointing amen
[46:43] praise god the word that brings the
[46:45] people into rapture and faith amen
[46:47] so god must amen he's given an anointing
[46:51] an outpouring of the holy ghost a surge
[46:54] amen a double portion of his spirit
[46:56] amen to bring us oh god into rapture and
[46:59] faith
[47:00] amen what is it amen and we can't say
[47:02] amen we can't say hallelujah
[47:04] we can't say thank you jesus why because
[47:07] the revelation is not striking deep
[47:09] enough
[47:10] amid the urgency of the time we just
[47:13] amen we sit
[47:14] still as though he's talking about
[47:15] somebody else but he said that's
[47:17] me oh lord amen praise god as the little
[47:20] boy
[47:21] saw himself in the mirror and he
[47:22] recognized that's me amen
[47:24] and you must see yourself in the mirror
[47:26] of the word and recognize that's
[47:28] you amen god was speaking of you amen
[47:31] and i see
[47:32] amen myself in the word amen and that
[47:35] the real word
[47:36] manifestation amen a bride coming of the
[47:40] lord jesus christ amen
[47:42] and she amen it's coming into her
[47:44] perfection amen
[47:45] because amen perfection comes amen
[47:49] through the word and christ said be
[47:51] perfect amen there must be a perfect
[47:53] oh bride amen praise god what makes you
[47:57] perfect it's what the blood of jesus
[47:59] christ did for us
[48:01] and we must read amen praise god point
[48:03] it to calvary
[48:05] amen and we must get that surge amen
[48:08] to look younger to calvary and what

[48:18] covenant it's between you and
[48:20] i brother and sister we got to take
[48:22] advantage of what he did amen and
[48:24] coverage
[48:25] to bring perfection to bring the bride
[48:27] back in order
[48:29] amen stay in step brother it says here
[48:34] it says
[48:36] okay okay it says for yourselves know
[48:39] preferably that the day of the lord does

[49:19] one another
[49:20] they meant they if they can destroy you
[49:22] in the name of
[49:23] uh of defending themselves because they
[49:27] uh you know it's something that we're
[49:29] living in a world
[49:30] it meant that people will think they're
[49:32] doing god a service
[49:34] even by condemning the prophet and all
[49:37] kind of stuff that they're doing amen
[49:39] instead of going on and trying to get a
[49:41] sinner to christ amen
[49:43] trying to get somebody for the baptism
[49:45] of the holy ghost
[49:46] trying to get somebody that's crippled

[1:06:02] even so them also would sleep in jesus
[1:06:05] will god bring with him
[1:06:08] amen praise god

[1:06:28] that sleep amen
[1:06:29] for the lord himself shall what
[1:06:32] descend from heaven with a shout

[1:06:38] was all about a shout
[1:06:40] the lord himself not a man but the lord
[1:06:42] himself
[1:06:44] shall descend with the child praise god
[1:06:47] when the minister meet preaching the
[1:06:50] gospel and teaching the gospel
[1:06:51] it should not be the man it should be
[1:06:53] god
[1:06:55] but a lot of times people they see the
[1:06:57] veil and they think they see moses
[1:06:59] but he said the lord said i'm going to
[1:07:01] deliver them out
[1:07:03] and god was the deliverer not moses but

[1:07:26] and as much as he's bought you with the
[1:07:28] shop the rapture has begun
[1:07:30] in you because he's raptures us out of
[1:07:34] dead
[1:07:35] creeds and dogmas and denominational
[1:07:37] system and he raptures us
[1:07:39] out to be identified with him

[1:07:48] you've been quickened by the spirit
[1:07:51] you've been called out

[1:08:25] praise god you are a manifestation of
[1:08:27] those that have walked out
[1:08:30] and now you and you're in you're taking
[1:08:32] the steps of ending you're walking with
[1:08:34] god

[1:09:11] the lord that
[1:09:12] we which alive
[1:09:15] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[1:09:17] shall not prevent them to sleep
[1:09:19] 16 verse for the lord himself shall

[1:09:22] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:09:24] of an archangel
[1:09:25] and what the what trump of god

[1:09:39] the dead and matthew
[1:09:42] said the dead folks are the saints jesus
[1:09:45] was the first fruit of the resurrection
[1:09:46] he got up
[1:09:47] and the saints that were asleep
