the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen appreciate the Lord tonight amen even if you have your Bible ask you to turn with us if you will to the book of Deuteronomy the seventh chapter had thoughts upon our hearts minds and seemly this seems to echo out to us in our spirit and so we pray tonight a man that gotta give the increase and talking to some people to other day and just sharing with them you know that how that our lives has been impacted by this epidemic but I believe to us that it's an encouragement also it helped us to realize one thing that if God don't help us we are perish I believe if there's ever time and a people ought to really seek God and to really examine their lives to be certain that we have a relationship with him do you wanna meet seventh chapter six through nine it reads for thou aren't a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord that God had chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people for ye were the fearless of all people but because the Lord love you I like that you know it's good to know that God loves us amen and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your father's had the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeem you out of the house of bond men from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt one more place the Book of Leviticus I want to come back here to do your army but the Book of Leviticus just one scripture Leviticus the 20th chapter in 26 you shall be holy unto me for I the LORD am holy and has served you from other people that ye shall be mine blessed father the word tonight in Jesus name Amen we be seated I want to speak a few minutes by God's grace to you tonight on a little thought of our peculiar and holy people a peculiar and a holy people I realizing as God here was talking to Israel because that Israel was in Egypt in bondage under the taskmasters now eat it was a type of the world they were in condition that they were putting heavy burdens upon the people and Israel begin to cry out to God for deliverance you know I've found that it's good to know that you can call on God when you need help sometimes we fail to recognize where our help really come from but you understand that when nothing else can works God is the answer no doubt especially we are thinking within our minds you know about a peculiar in a holy people peculiar on-screen holy people I like that part because it's not so much that you make yourself holy but it's because God is holy and in that when we recognize that our God is looking for holiness he's looking for not just a holy name that's been tagged on you but he's looking for his life to the well in you and then when that life the wells in you then it's a holy God in you it's not ourself man-made thing that we make ourself holy because of some creeds are some kind of laws that we have adopted but no it's because of God that we are serving his holy I wish that we can really understand that what holiness really is about because we have we may name for ourself and we put labels on ourself and we can scrub bylaws to try to make a certain church holy but there was no church holy it's God that is holy I believe it was God that when he spoke to Moses when he got to this certain place he said Moses take off your shoes because the ground you're standing on is holy ground see and more than is understood that I where he was at he was in the presence of God and where the presence of God is that's a holy place but now God presences is not so much what we call as we look at it as being in a particular church setting but God will still live in us innocent life of God the whales in us and then because of his life the well is in you it makes you holy but it's not a self-righteous act it's not something you work up it's not something because of or you do a lot of church rules and you keep the Sabbath in you do do this and you don't do that no that's not why you are holy see because of our churches had has made their own little bylaws you know to make their group holy than other people but that's all man-made but now listen I like this because in Deuteronomy 7 he said here now in 64 down on a holy people unto the Lord see God looking for holy people not to a church but God wants you to come to him God is looking for people that he chose see is it's not so much of what we choose but it's God that does the choosing it's God that one that chose us but why did he chose us here he said now that God had chosen me to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth you know it is such a real thing that that people are really come to God cuz we go to church and we go to seminars and we go to different places but it's different than when you meet gods yourself and you have a personal relationship with Almighty God I believe that's the place that we need to is alright to come to church it's good to come to church but you've got to come to God see because God is calling you see so many times we almost you know look at that the church call us but the Bible said God is a jealous God he's not going to share his glory with no one why because he had a right to it why because it was him that gave his life for us no preacher no church no Crees know it was God didn't God give his life for us to take us back to himself and when he come to redeem humankind back to him again because we were lost no way that home the first man Adam and Eve when God made them and created them and they and lost fellowship with their Creator you know it's a terrible thing when you lose fellowship with your makeup so when you do you start wondering around wondering who are you what are you come to do and why you were here you search any way of trying to find out where you fit in you might go to the jungle you might think you a Bilson and you love that but she has to realize that you belong to God no man boss you about us that we are bought with a price and we are not our own that's why Paul said like this he said now the life that I now live see you may be living a certain lifestyle but it has to be a different lifestyle but understand this except God called you and chose you for it you know I just you know just remembering so well you know that how about I said that are in time past we were not God's people but God redeem us back to him now notice he also in a 7th verse of the seventh chapter you say now the Lord did not set his love I look at that word love see it was God love that did this his love can screen him to die for us at Calvary not that we deserve because we did not deserve it but yet God loved look beyond all of our faults and he saw we needed him I could imagine in a whole human race in Genesis when they had him and even lost everything and the whole world willing to chaos the human race now was lost without knowing God personalized way and God loved them so that he made a way back that they could come back and fellowship with him but you know God loves people but he hates sin he loves people but he hate the sin so God went and did something about the sin problem seeing that's the problem the sin problem at Calvary was settled he came to settle the sin issue what did he do he took it on himself oh I like that and he took it upon himself to die for people that was wretched and undone and gave us his life and he took our dirty life oh my what a mighty God we serve who would love a God like that who and I want to serve somebody then even a width to the Lord's region of hell and strip the devil there were all the powers that he ever had you know the powers of darkness that had covered the earth like it is somewhat today darkness has covered the face of the earth gross darkness getting so bad you know you just don't are the corruption and everything that's going on in the world even in this epidemic we having the sin hasn't stopped why because people hasn't recognized you know that God has redeemed them back and God wants the people to be a peculiar in our holy people see God is calling for holiness it's a standard that that God sent not just a holy church we call it but a holy God in the people Sika the word church means called out we've been called out of the world to be a different people to be a people you know that that has been converted to a people that have heard the voice of God and God called them by their name about us saying I have chosen to you since God choosing it's not the preacher it's not no church but it's God you know and I like that so much because you know when God chooses us he don't chew lead us on the basis of what we have he don't choose us on the basis of our educational standard or our economical standard or where we live and what we possess no god don't look at that if you notice in the Bible God or Jesus always went to those with out he went to the poor he went to those that were cast out he's very sudden went to the rich though he has so much people but God gave them the riches see there's no greater riches that you can ever have until you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior didn't you're rich so rich you you don't know what all you have there's another place I wanted to read I believe is Ian do you wanna me 14 let me try to jump over there for a minute I want to come back but this really struck me this morning that I was just reading my little devotion and I really started from right here do you wanna be 14 1 & 2 Yatta cheated on the Lord to your God you should not cut yourselves now I make inter ball that's between your eyes for the dead for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord had chosen B to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations upon the earth there were no scripture that God said that that that all souls are mind that we belong to him sometimes we get a little amnesia stricken because that we don't know who we belong to but God is that is the creator he is the one made us and he made us for his purpose here it also say now the Lord did not choose you in back in he was seven because you were great but he said you are the fearless of all the people see he said he did it because his love that he had for us not because you were more in number than any of the people for you were the felis of all people but because the Lord loved you and he expressing the love of God that he had for us and how he chose us in himself to be a peculiar people to be a holy priesthood to be acceptable in the sight of God see you a special God when God looks at you he's looking at himself because he made you to worship Him he made you to serve him he made you to be the blessed people on the earth you blessed you we just don't under realize how blessed we really are it is no effort that we've done of our own it was the grace of God God's grace mean that unmerited favor you found favor with God why because he loved you and God wanted to express his love what did he do he gave up his life oh I like that he he showed you how much he loves you now I'm gonna lay down my life what kind of man would do something like that then I lay down his life for ungodly people from people that didn't even who are what even serving him but yet God look beyond our folks and he saw your need I believe it said one place in the Bible no man can come to the Father except I draw him see God got a drawing power and God knows how to draw you see is God choosing you lot of people at this think something where I come to God when I get ready that's a mistake it's God does the choosing you just Hawking to the call about us immediate call but a few are chosen see a few many hear the gospel that's what the gospel is called the good news because it is good if I would say old pace and see that the Lord he is but you can't taste gods but when you try God and find out he's everything you've been looking for in more oh I'm dead I just love to know because I realize that how wretched and miserable I want us are no good for nothing should have been dead but because of God's grace and God's mercy on me somebody say my mother prayed for me thank God for godly mothers thank God for the old timers that begin to get on their knees late at night and say Lord wherever my child is Lord you can save them they knew how to get in contact with God see it wasn't just some mist they knew what they call along the heart with all their heart gotta come oh how thank God for having godly mothers and fathers that knew harder really get in contact with a real God now see that's the problem a lot of times we are giving the people some false hope that God is some great great granddaddy but no man no sir this God we're talking about he's right here right now all he's able to do for you more than what you can ask a think oh he is more than able to do it come on God hasn't changed what he did that did he can do it now we're not serving a historical God but we're serving a God of Hebrews 13 and 18 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever got a couple of reports by the pastor a couple of things that we have a prayer list there should be sure to tell them that they have fully recovered and fully it doctor fully released them you know it's good to hear good news our miss of the order negative there is some positive but you can't have the positive unless you got a negative because you need to both to get a reaction and that's what we need we need a spiritual reaction oh how we need to know and we call on God he'll come to our rescue he's never too late he never misses appointment somebody says he's an old-time god yes he is ah I know it for myself he did it for me sister sing that song you may never have been in a darkness oh but he did for me that's what the kind of God I'm talking about a God that loves you in spite of a God that don't come to condemn you but he wants to lift you up he wants to bring you out no matter what you are facing no matter what kind of shade you may look at your life tonight as being messed up oh but that's the time God is the master he knows how to take a mess and clean it all up and then give them the blessings and she will look back at your life and say how did he do it how did God do it how one time I was on the other side of the fence serving the devil you know selling drugs in the club but one day Jesus came my way one day he came my way I hope tonight that Jesus comes your way tonight if he ever comes your way your life can never be the same you'll be a new creature you'll live a holy life because there's a holy God that's in you the power of the Holy Ghost oh that's what the church world need they need Holy Ghost in order to live a holy life without it without the Holy Ghost you'll be struggling with things of the world you'll be struggling with habits but once you understand the struggle is over Jesus came to break the chains Oh My yes when he went to hell he scrubbed the devil of alcohol demons immorality you don't have to live that way anymore you don't have to be a liar you don't have to be a fornicator you don't have to be a drug addict you can come to Jesus well I hope somebody come to Jesus somebody somebody come to Jesus tonight realize that you might be in a mess but God got something better for you oh my I think about the love of God sometimes and where he brought me from look at how low he went let me tell you something God came in the crowd way I was no I wasn't in a church but God goes to the club's yeah but we can go there he got a purpose why he go no he going to get on a dance floor but God got a purple why because a Sun our dawn of God is in here and he said now I got to get him out I got to get them out of their situation they don't belong there they belong to me I thought about one time I was going into Newbery working is a turkey plant and I passed by our trucks coming from Marian going to Newberry and this truck had cages you know turkeys you know going in and I got to the plant where the turkey farm was and these trucks had these trailers that they had to pull in and they backed the turkeys Indian and they got fans that keep him cool because they got to be temperature but before they got to this certain stall one of the cages Oh No turkey pop open and what are the turkeys public huh from North Carolina somewhere he will ride us along and did we hear the speed bump the truck trailer knock him out I don't own the ground and he was just sitting there like looking at just my interpretation he was sitting there wondering maybe where he's at but he didn't realize he was free he kind of got up and hit the woods because the cage was open I want you to know your cage is open but don't just sit there staring at it run for your life that's what we need to do run with everything in you run oh my you can never get the people to understand that they don't have to be in bondage they don't have to live like that we living below our god-given privileges come on we ought to be living like sons and daughters of God we're going to be living like I like animals sometimes human live lower than an animal it's because they don't realize who they are your sons and daughters they're gonna give you not to make you stuck up but yelling make you feel real good that oh God thank you for all that you've done for me no doubt that night that I was in a club in God the voice the God spoke to me oh yes God got a mouth and God speaks and you know when God speak he'd know how to get your attention and everyday have you ever healed that voice of God it'll cause you Larry in a different manner I'm driving a peculiar holy people that one out there at that night it caused me to react differently because I heard something that I've never heard see the voice of God if you ever really hear it Anna calls you to change and you don't usually know why but from that day in 1987 was the beginning of a whole new different life that day when the voice of God spoke to me I never sold drugs anymore I never used it anymore I never touched I did even with the church yet see God can deal with you before you get to the church I heard somebody say I glad God got a hold of me before the church did cuz sometimes church messes you up but it's God the real God now this real God I'm talking about if he ever gets the whole of your life if you ever that's part of your scene when you hear the voice of God talking tonight you may be in your house you may be on the street you might even be in your car but hearken to the voice I believe God is still calling I believe he's calling more saying come on to me if you have a burden and you need rest my sister my brother come to God now don't wait what are you waiting for what are we waiting for so many time we'd like to try to wait on somebody else but no don'twe don't know but you come if God calling you you make the decision that's what I had to did even when I was in the county jail in that time and this preacher came in the first time the preacher came in I heard him preach that night and he preached the message great is the gate it was about 35 or 40 of us there and that experience that I had while continuing it in that prison the county jail that I mean that done Fela preached he even tell scrape is the gate it's an error always see it's not a Broadway but insolent narrowly but he said feel there be did find it all when you find that straight and narrow way regardless of what about a think about you they might call you crazy they might call you fanatic but come on don't worry about what they say you listen to the voice cuz it'll make you act strange it'll make you let's go to one more scripture oh my first Peter might be already even quoted thinking about these things I said Lord what else is it in life that people won't that can do them like you can do them that can change your desire you may have a desire to smoke a desire to do under godliness but God can chain that desire see God wants to to reroute your life see this virus may rewrite a people like but God want to rewrite it that's why he brought the change and well you can really look at life on really what it means to you they always say life is like a vapor you were here today and you go on tomorrow that's why we need to really understand what life really is real life is serving God letting eternal life come in and take out of you don't things that not gonna do you any good why hole oh I know what it's like you know the bill drugs and alcohol and wake up the next morning and start over again and there's one day after another after another after another but all one thing all it takes you know I'm understanding it don't take a lot of things but one word from the Lord can make a difference I'll pray the night that you just hear something from God tonight that I calls you to say I wanna change and so many times people do want to change but they don't know where to go they lost confidence in the reaches it he lost confidence in the church because all they want to give the people is a money institution people said while I give my money in like this and I ain't getting no benefits see you chemically you want some benefits you want something that you want to profit off of and God want to give you something and you can benefit from God wants you to walk different God wants you to live different so that's why he wants to give you the Holy Ghost and where you can become a new creation that your conversation the way you go I'll be different sometimes a the places I used to go I don't go anymore why because there's been a change in my life and I want to tell you something appreciate didn't give it to me I had a brother girl used to sing that song just joy did I have the world didn't give it to me oh he used to sing that song I can hear the air cooling down the house and he said nobody but Jesus gave it to me empty when Jesus give you something he he know how to finish it the work that he starts in you he knows how to complete it the God that same you the God that calls you in the garden is able to keep you I thank God he's not an India to give up but when he gives you something it's forever eternal life is forever once you ever obtain it and it's free no you can't pay for it you can't worry for it you don't earn it it's just a bit of fish of God's grace that he said you belongs to me he said come my sister come my daughter you've been looking at yourself as being so tore up you know and I realize that condition that I will always throw up my old family didn't want to have nothing to do with me I didn't want to be around because I felt embarrassed cuz I was living Lord and a son of God was forced to leave yes I went to church I heard the preaching I saw this singing in the shouting but I didn't get any of it it's sad to say sometimes you can go to church and you can you shout you can sing and you can just speak in tongues and do all those things yet not be saved but I promised the Lord I said God if you saved me God I'll go all the way here and that was back in 1987 now I never regret the choice that I made but it was one of my choice I heard the call and I'd realize that lord I need this see until you really recognize you need it you think your life is okay and that's the worst shape you're in when you think you're all right because when you think you all right that's when you really a miss church I pray tonight that you will look at yourself in a magnitude of the word and realize that God called you to be a peculiar holy people not just a person to come to a church but God wants your life he wants to purify you inside out I believe this experience that we need it's the inside out it starts intimately and then it'll work itself out I pray the night that if you were listening and you were tuning into us tonight and as the pastor come tonight that you know he lead us in the prayer and I hope that not only that you heard it but you would take heed cuz it's a later then you thank you god bless you tonight let's just bow our heads father in the name of Jesus Christ you said X and it shall be given Lord you said knocking the door shall be opened father our trust tonight somebody under the sound of my voice somebody tuning in somewhere in the world Lord God hearing this message tonight Lord that can identify with the word see the need of Jesus in their lives father I pray tonight
