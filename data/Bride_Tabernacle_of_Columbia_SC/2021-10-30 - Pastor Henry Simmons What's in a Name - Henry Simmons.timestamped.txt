[33:59] the third chapter we understand that
[34:02] peter
[34:02] and john was going into the temple the
[34:06] gate called beautiful
[34:08] and found a man that was impotent
[34:11] amen acts in arms of them and they began
[34:14] to
[34:15] say unto them civil and gold have i
[34:18] none thank god that they had something
[34:21] that they could give them
[34:23] but it wasn't civil goal
[34:25] but such as we have we give them to thee
[34:29] they was able to give the man something
[34:31] i trust that that same god is in his
[34:34] people now
[34:36] praise god that they can do the same
[34:38] things that he did then
[34:40] praise god it's not just a god of
[34:42] history but he's a god that says i am
[34:45] amen
[34:47] and if he is and he
[34:49] he's your i am amen
[34:52] praise god you know what he resides
[34:55] such a hat as i have
[34:57] okay uh acts uh for
[35:02] i'll read the first you read the next we
[35:04] go down to the 12th
[35:05] verse
[35:08] and as they speak
[35:10] unto
[35:12] unto the people
[35:13] the priests and the captains of the
[35:16] temple
[35:17] and the saggy seeds came upon them too
[35:27] and they laid hands on them and put them
[35:30] in hold until the next day for it was
[35:34] now evening time for
[35:44] and it came to pass on the morrow that
[35:47] their rulers and elders inscribed six
[36:02] and when they had set them in the midst
[36:05] they asked by what power are
[36:08] by what name have you done this
[36:19] if
[36:20] we be
[36:22] this day examined
[36:24] of the good deed done to the impotent
[36:27] man
[36:28] by what means he is made hold ten
[36:47] this is the stone which was set at north
[36:50] of your builders which is become the
[36:53] head of the corner together
[36:55] neither is there salvation in any other
[36:58] for there is none of the name under
[37:00] heaven given among men whereby we must
[37:03] be saved
[37:05] god bless you enjoyed you may be seated
[37:12] sometimes
[37:14] we want to ask the question what's
[37:18] in a name
[37:21] somebody said a good name is
[37:25] better to be chosen than gold
[37:28] a good name
[37:30] what's in a name we know that
[37:33] jacob
[37:35] amen wrestle with the angel and
[37:38] and he prevailed
[37:40] and he said your name would no more be
[37:42] called jacob which ildra shall be thy
[37:45] name
[37:46] because he was a prince with god he had
[37:48] power with god
[37:50] amen so you just can't i always tell
[37:53] young people don't just name your child
[37:56] one of these good african names or one
[37:58] of these good name to sound good
[38:01] but you got to notice something that's
[38:03] in the name
[38:04] are you with me
[38:06] because a lot of people you don't know
[38:08] where they what that what that name mean
[38:11] my wife was telling me you know she
[38:14] worked in the prison system and she was
[38:15] teaching in the prison she said
[38:18] you can almost
[38:21] even outside the prison when the people
[38:23] have a certain name
[38:25] they're almost headed to prison because
[38:27] you name them something
[38:30] you know and um
[38:34] and a lot of times people
[38:36] are going to go name their children
[38:37] without praying about it without trying
[38:40] to see what is a good name
[38:43] for a good name means
[38:47] but i want to talk about the name that's
[38:49] above every name
[38:51] amen
[38:52] we got we have
[38:54] many great prophets jeremiah isaiah
[38:56] moses
[38:58] abraham isaac jacob but
[39:01] he's he said here
[39:02] neither it is salvation in any other
[39:07] we had great church aids messages we had
[39:09] paul irenaeus and we you know we had
[39:13] different ones so he had
[39:15] you know luther and wesley and you know
[39:18] columbus and different ones you know we
[39:20] had
[39:22] uh you know we had william branham we
[39:24] had different ones amen
[39:26] but
[39:28] neither is that salvation in any other
[39:32] well there's none other name
[39:34] praise god we got to be certain that the
[39:37] the the name that we are interested in
[39:41] is the name of jesus
[39:43] the name that saves is the name of jesus
[39:47] amen somebody said well you did you miss
[39:49] my name your name is not important
[39:52] my name is not important
[39:55] but one thing if you can miss out and
[39:57] and forget my name you can forget
[40:01] so and so see
[40:04] they were
[40:05] telling jesus we got abraham for our
[40:08] father uh uh-huh you you we don't need
[40:12] you jesus
[40:13] we got abraham of our father are you
[40:16] greater than our father abraham isaac
[40:18] and jacob are you greater than our
[40:20] father to build this well the woman said
[40:24] and jesus was saying
[40:26] before abraham was i am
[40:30] are you with me
[40:32] so what happens amen
[40:34] paul says the people were in dispute
[40:38] that's just it shows you in corinthians
[40:40] here um
[40:42] how people got excited about
[40:45] a different
[40:46] message i mean different apostles and so
[40:49] forth and they were they were caught up
[40:52] in the in the name of oh you know um
[40:55] exalting one name above another
[40:58] are you with me
[41:00] and uh and that's what
[41:03] and paul had to straighten them out
[41:05] now this is what he said in first
[41:06] corinthians 1 and 10.
[41:09] my beseechu brethren by the name of our
[41:12] lord jesus christ
[41:14] are you with me
[41:16] i wish paul was here today and he could
[41:18] speak to the people of the church world
[41:21] today and i believe
[41:23] amen some church some people think
[41:26] because i'm a baptist
[41:28] then it's power in being the baptist
[41:31] some people said it's power and being
[41:32] the method it's just power and being the
[41:34] jehovah witness of jehovah is his name
[41:37] and some people you know they get caught
[41:39] up on
[41:40] but to us today neither is that
[41:43] salvation in any other
[41:45] amen some people want to say jesse or
[41:49] they want to you know they want to say
[41:50] that greek you know i mean the hebrew or
[41:52] whatever
[41:53] and they think you know but i i think
[41:56] god understands
[41:58] i think the name of jesus works
[42:01] i think amen you can say it in hebrew or
[42:04] whatever you want but i i said
[42:07] it works for me
[42:09] the name jesus worked for me
[42:12] praise god
[42:14] you know there was in spanish they might
[42:16] say jesus or jesus or whatever
[42:19] you know
[42:20] but the name jesus works

[44:31] what i'm saying

[45:40] something happens you know they expect
[45:43] things to happen
[45:45] when the name of jesus is called amen
[45:48] with an honest heart somebody that got
[45:50] faith in the name
[45:53] praise god
[45:57] you got to have some faith in the name
[46:00] praise god hallelujah
[46:02] don't just call on me because paul

[46:24] and because you don't have it in you
[46:26] and you go to try to imitate
[46:30] you try to call
[46:31] jesus and try to cast out the devil and
[46:34] the devils jump out and
[46:36] whip the people and beat them down the
[46:38] street
[46:39] strip their clothes off from random way
[46:41] naked

[46:53] right with god and you calling on jesus
[46:56] says though jesus don't see
[46:59] amen the little stuff we do in secret
[47:03] are you with me
[47:05] but when you write with god amen he said
[47:08] the prayer of the righteous
[47:11] avail as much
[47:14] but we do all kind of stuff
[47:17] and we hide behind the name
[47:20] praise god and we hide behind you have a
[47:23] name that you live it and you're dead
[47:27] praise god
[47:29] amen but god amen he knows them that are
[47:33] his
[47:34] and he knows that everyone that name the
[47:37] name of christ
[47:39] he said let him depart from iniquity
[47:43] isn't that right
[47:44] for he said nevertheless the foundation
[47:46] of god stand in the shoe
[47:49] having this seal
[47:51] come on somebody
[47:53] amen the lord knows
[47:56] them that are healed
[47:58] he god amen oh lord
[48:01] you can't fool god you get real god know
[48:05] whether you're real or not
[48:07] but if you're trying to cover and hide
[48:10] and deceive
[48:12] god knows that too
[48:14] aren't you glad that god eyes and he can
[48:16] look amen
[48:23] see i find people want credit for what
[48:27] god's done
[48:31] men won't credit
[48:33] and people want you to give credit
[48:36] to the church
[48:38] they want you to give credit
[48:41] to
[48:42] the bishop or to
[48:45] this great man i'm giving credit to
[48:47] jesus
[48:50] jesus is the one that
[48:53] we need to give christ you know oh
[48:56] brother simmons nothing
[48:58] but you owe everything to
[49:00] christ you owe everything to jesus
[49:05] amen you owe them everything
[49:12] and
[49:13] and because we know
[49:15] amen how much we owed him
[49:18] i was telling them mullins last night
[49:20] about
[49:21] you know
[49:22] sometimes
[49:23] people do things
[49:26] expecting because god owed
[49:29] amen and i was saying that suddenly
[49:32] some folk think god owed them
[49:36] and some they they
[49:38] the church of all i did
[49:41] all i done
[49:43] and you know folk
[49:46] look at all i'm doing and nobody
[49:48] recognize what i've done
[49:51] you know it's a blessing that nobody
[49:53] recognize what you're doing
[49:56] you can do so much and nobody recognize
[49:58] but that's your greatest lesson
[50:01] because you didn't do it to get any
[50:03] praise and any glory for man
[50:06] amen
[50:08] but you did it because you know amen
[50:11] praise god god which is done in secret
[50:13] god would reward you openly
[50:16] are you with me
[50:17] you know that god ate hallelujah god i i
[50:22] only could do it because you
[50:24] gave me strength to do it
[50:26] i only could be a blessing because you
[50:29] blessed me to be a blessing
[50:32] amen i i couldn't give if you didn't
[50:35] give it to me
[50:36] praise god i couldn't do it if you oh
[50:40] hallelujah if you hadn't done it for me
[50:44] amen because you done it oh hallelujah
[50:47] hey god you when you get a gift your
[50:50] gift comes from god all good
[50:53] and perfect gifts come from above
[50:56] so whatever you got amen freely you have
[51:00] received freely give
[51:03] hallelujah
[51:04] don't charge
[51:17] oh lord
[51:18] they want people
[51:21] lord
[51:22] when you come in your king no grant
[51:25] one of my son said you're right and left
[51:29] he said
[51:30] it's not mine to kill it's already
[51:32] prepared before the foundation of the
[51:35] world who gonna sell on the right who
[51:36] gonna sell on the left
[51:38] are you with me
[51:40] so uh what god
[51:43] has for you it is for you
[51:46] nobody can take your position your place
[51:49] nobody could do it
[51:51] somebody took my place that wasn't your
[51:53] place all the time if it was your place
[51:56] nobody could take it
[52:00] are you with me
[52:02] because why
[52:04] god said touch not my anointing do my
[52:06] prophets no harm
[52:08] you know we can position replace
[52:11] ourselves and god has nothing to do with
[52:14] it
[52:15] we can establish ourselves i i i'm gonna
[52:19] say you can go 40 50 years even in
[52:24] in a ministry and god can raise up
[52:26] somebody overnight
[52:29] praise god and god can replace you like
[52:31] that
[52:33] amen god don't have no respect of any
[52:35] person
[52:36] god can use anybody anytime anywhere
[52:40] well god can do what he wants
[52:43] [Applause]
[52:44] are you a man
[52:46] so you know
[52:48] i used to hear the old elder
[52:51] he said
[52:52] we need god
[52:54] god don't need us
[52:56] but we shall need him
[52:59] amen
[53:00] and and and that
[53:02] and that's the problem we got to a place
[53:05] where people
[53:06] absorb zero in on
[53:09] themselves
[53:11] that the name of jesus is being left out
[53:13] of everything
[53:15] he said in colossians 3 and 17 and what
[53:20] so ever you do and what
[53:24] if you can't do it in the name of what
[53:28] in the name of the lord in the name of
[53:30] jesus
[53:31] don't do it at all
[53:35] you say you know people ask me a
[53:36] question brother simmons is all right
[53:38] for me to do this law i said can you
[53:40] would jesus do it
[53:43] would jesus do what you're doing
[53:45] sometimes the folk rely on jesus
[53:49] they say yeah jesus to do it it's okay
[53:53] so i know if you lie on jesus you rely
[53:55] on me
[53:57] because you know good one jesus wouldn't
[53:58] do what you do
[54:02] but some people some people are honest
[54:04] they say
[54:07] you gotta think on that
[54:09] i think jesus
[54:10] and see sometimes the company we keep
[54:13] we're wondering if jesus would be doing
[54:15] what you know sometimes the
[54:17] companionship and you know people be
[54:20] against the word and fighting the word
[54:22] and you are
[54:25] you know
[54:27] it's the name of jesus being glorified
[54:31] see that i'm talking about what's in a
[54:33] name
[54:35] see the name of j you're representing
[54:38] the name
[54:41] you are actually representing the name
[54:43] of jesus the whole family in heaven and
[54:45] earth is name
[54:48] you represent for paul said i'm not
[54:50] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[54:52] which is the power of god and the
[54:53] salvation to everyone to believe
[54:56] amen
[54:57] so what is
[54:59] you representing jesus christ
[55:02] when you go when you walk when you talk
[55:04] the way you live the way you conduct
[55:06] your life it's the name that's being
[55:09] exalted
[55:10] you got to realize that you got a name
[55:13] that's above every name
[55:17] amen
[55:20] thank god for the name of simmons and
[55:23] thank god for the name of this but that
[55:25] ain't the name that we want to shine
[55:28] we don't want the
[55:30] the name of league at the shine we don't
[55:32] know the name of simmons to sign the
[55:34] name upon we want the name of jesus to
[55:36] shine
[55:38] are you with me
[55:40] i thank god you know for your children
[55:43] for your wife you know you know but i
[55:46] don't want to exalt my wife i don't want
[55:47] to exalt my children i want to exalt
[55:50] jesus
[55:52] that's what you want you want jesus to
[55:54] shine
[55:55] amen praise god
[55:59] but sometimes we want we want to exalt
[56:04] and we want
[56:05] for
[56:06] human flesh to shine
[56:09] look at me
[56:12] look at me
[56:13] y'all see me
[56:16] come on
[56:18] i'm talking about exalting the name of
[56:20] jesus
[56:23] in the name of jesus
[56:25] praise god
[56:26] is the the name that should be exalted
[56:30] and you can't exalt jesus name without
[56:33] exalting his word
[56:36] amen
[56:38] and see if
[56:40] if
[56:40] if you abide in me and my word about you
[56:43] you can only place jesus in the word you
[56:47] know
[56:48] he and the word are one his name was
[56:50] called the word of god
[56:52] are you a
[56:54] so you take away
[56:56] though
[56:58] the word of god and then you try to
[57:00] exalt something outside the word it
[57:02] won't work
[57:06] and i find many people
[57:08] taking and saying
[57:10] that this is the name i'm exalting the
[57:11] name of jesus
[57:13] this is what the lord said
[57:15] this is what the law does the lord don't
[57:18] do stuff like that
[57:20] the lord is he's a humble god
[57:24] he's a compassionate and understanding
[57:27] god
[57:30] you know i told him last night when i
[57:32] read the romans 12 again to them i said
[57:36] the bible said don't render
[57:39] evil for evil
[57:42] bless them that persecute you
[57:45] bless them they curse you
[57:48] i said how many of y'all were doing that
[57:52] and they were honest
[57:54] they knew they knew better
[57:57] you know and that's the same thing
[57:59] the the the day the minute somebody said
[58:02] something we don't like we we we
[58:05] we blow off and
[58:07] ain't no blessing you ain't gonna invite
[58:09] them to dinner no more

[1:04:33] see that's what the key is
[1:04:36] it doesn't matter how great a a person's
[1:04:39] ministry
[1:04:40] how much god uses an individual
[1:04:43] it comes down to who was crucified for
[1:04:46] you
[1:04:48] who died for your sins
[1:04:50] are you with me
[1:04:52] who was crucified for you
[1:04:55] thank god for god you you know sometimes
[1:04:58] people say well
[1:05:02] jesus died for me i don't set out to
[1:05:04] disrespect
[1:05:06] you know we don't want to disrespect
[1:05:08] god's servant for the this island
[1:05:11] and what god has done
[1:05:13] for us
[1:05:15] for the message of the hour and we don't
[1:05:17] want to disrespect
[1:05:19] the fireform ministry
[1:05:21] the evangelists the pastors the prophet
[1:05:23] the teachers we don't want to disrespect
[1:05:25] them
[1:05:26] but we want to keep everybody in their
[1:05:28] place
[1:05:30] are you with me
[1:05:32] see people use you know they can use the
[1:05:34] scripture
[1:05:35] nobody died for me but jesus
[1:05:39] that's who i ah that's who i listen to
[1:05:41] jesus
[1:05:45] praise god you know they're big and bad
[1:05:47] i don't know nobody jesus
[1:05:51] you might want to go on in the
[1:05:52] wilderness
[1:05:54] and be by yourself
[1:05:57] look gone in the wilderness and be by
[1:05:59] yourself because you don't need nobody
[1:06:00] but jesus
[1:06:02] are you with me
[1:06:04] but we got to be humble enough to say we
[1:06:06] need one another
[1:06:09] this is one body in many members
[1:06:12] and we need one another
[1:06:15] you need a pastor
[1:06:17] don't care if you're a prophet or pastor
[1:06:19] whatever you need a pastor
[1:06:21] somebody gonna straighten you out
[1:06:26] somebody got to give a count for you
[1:06:28] watch for your soul

[1:06:33] talk to you if he talking to you tell
[1:06:35] you you need a pastor
[1:06:42] and
[1:06:43] what happens is
[1:06:45] we've gotten so loose in this age here
[1:06:49] they're loose in the schoolhouse
[1:06:52] the political system is just wild
[1:06:55] everything is just loose
[1:06:57] nobody won't head ship want nobody no oh

[1:07:02] this is that layout of the seal means
[1:07:04] people what
[1:07:06] i got a right to do what i want
[1:07:09] and that's what they're doing exactly
[1:07:11] what they want
[1:07:12] and nobody's going to tell them nothing
[1:07:15] if it's anywhere
[1:07:17] that we can get directed by the holy
[1:07:20] spirit and get in harmony and in union
[1:07:23] with god is that we come on the headship
[1:07:26] of the holy ghost and when the holy
[1:07:28] ghost speak then we ought to all
[1:07:30] recognize this is the holy ghost
[1:07:34] are you with me
[1:07:35] and the holy ghost bear witness with the
[1:07:39] with the word
[1:07:41] amen

[1:07:45] it back to

[1:07:50] we know we got
[1:07:51] in the right place
[1:07:53] are you with me
[1:07:54] but if we say i got the holy ghost and
[1:07:56] the holy ghost told me to do this the
[1:07:57] holy ghost told you to do that and the

[1:12:31] um
[1:12:32] see what i'm saying
[1:12:34] you let i'm going to tell you something
[1:12:36] see god
[1:12:37] and the holy spirit already told you
[1:12:42] don't do that don't do that
[1:12:44] you say well
[1:12:46] i got
[1:12:47] you know
[1:12:48] i got the love of god and i gotta
[1:12:50] see sometimes you gotta listen to god
[1:12:53] sometimes
[1:12:56] let me see what i read
[1:12:59] i hope i got it
[1:13:01] okay
[1:13:05] the prophet god says he says no matter
[1:13:07] how much is needed
[1:13:10] or
[1:13:12] how much
[1:13:13] everybody agree
[1:13:15] that
[1:13:16] it is needed
[1:13:19] and how much that
[1:13:21] it is truth
[1:13:24] there is yet one thing to find out
[1:13:29] is that the will of god
[1:13:33] is that the will of god
[1:13:40] see
[1:13:43] this is
[1:13:45] see sometimes
[1:13:48] we can do a thing
[1:13:51] and we
[1:13:52] thinking that we're doing the will of
[1:13:54] god
[1:13:55] and the prophet said you're trying to do
[1:13:58] god a service without it being his will
[1:14:05] you can try to do something for god
[1:14:08] that god did not attain
[1:14:13] i was talking to a minister today
[1:14:15] i said
[1:14:18] you know
[1:14:19] he's been out there i'm pretty big
[1:14:22] with some big people and all
[1:14:26] he said he's a brother simmons
[1:14:28] you know i don't desire
[1:14:32] all of these big great things out here
[1:14:36] you see i've been working
[1:14:38] he said but i don't need that all
[1:14:41] see i just want to be simple
[1:14:44] just want to be simple
[1:14:50] i said you know something
[1:14:53] i had respect for that brother
[1:14:57] and i can feel
[1:14:59] it coming from his heart
[1:15:01] so i ain't worried about that
[1:15:04] he said
[1:15:05] if i can only be a blessing
[1:15:08] to the local church
[1:15:11] if i can only be a blessing to the local
[1:15:14] assembly
[1:15:15] he said that's all
[1:15:18] that's what i teach
[1:15:20] that's what i preach
[1:15:22] how can i be a blessing
[1:15:24] to the locals assembly
[1:15:28] you see that's what i i said brother
[1:15:33] it ain't many like you
[1:15:36] they got the ability that you got
[1:15:39] but yet
[1:15:42] that they can that can be great
[1:15:45] or somebody way up there
[1:15:47] but choose not
[1:15:52] there ain't many people like that
[1:15:55] that has the opportunity to be way up
[1:15:58] there
[1:15:59] and great
[1:16:00] and yet they choose not
[1:16:06] i'm saying to you
[1:16:09] if you get up there
[1:16:11] it's the name of jesus
[1:16:14] are you getting up there to you know i
[1:16:17] you can use excuse lord i'm doing it in
[1:16:20] your name i want your name but it ah god
[1:16:23] says dandy
[1:16:27] see i'm gonna tell you when god does it
[1:16:30] when god puts you somewhere
[1:16:32] you don't even know it
[1:16:34] [Applause]
[1:16:38] you know
[1:16:39] you there and
[1:16:41] you don't even know you're there it just
[1:16:43] happened
[1:16:45] but when you got to
[1:16:46] what to get there
[1:16:49] you got to manipulate maneuver and try
[1:16:52] to get there
[1:16:56] because this is me i'm great
[1:17:00] god gave me this to give to the world
[1:17:03] god don't need that
[1:17:06] what we want to see is jesus
[1:17:10] the name of jesus
[1:17:12] praise god it doesn't matter how gifted
[1:17:14] we are how blessed we think we are god
[1:17:17] don't need it
[1:17:22] tell you something
[1:17:24] the people that god really
[1:17:26] uses and blesses is the people that not
[1:17:29] out
[1:17:30] it's not the world renown
[1:17:33] it's not many of them a call
[1:17:38] god calls the nobodies of the earth
[1:17:41] and he makes them
[1:17:42] somebody
[1:17:44] but they'll never be recognized by the
[1:17:46] world
[1:17:47] the world love
[1:17:50] the world love what
[1:17:53] praise god
[1:17:54] so
[1:17:55] if the word love is only then you're not
[1:17:58] of this
[1:18:00] are you with me
[1:18:02] so why you want to be recognized by them
[1:18:10] we're striving for something that god
[1:18:12] don't want us
[1:18:16] to have
[1:18:18] are you with me
[1:18:20] i keep saying it over and over again
[1:18:24] god promised to supply all of our needs
[1:18:27] according to his riches and glory
[1:18:33] what we want
[1:18:36] god to supply all of our wounds
[1:18:40] what we want we don't need and what we
[1:18:41] need we don't want
[1:18:46] are y'all with me
[1:18:48] i said what we need
[1:18:50] we don't want
[1:18:52] and what we want
[1:18:54] we don't need
[1:18:57] are you with me
[1:18:58] but
[1:18:59] oh yes huh
[1:19:01] i'm gonna get it i'm gonna get what i
[1:19:04] and that's why
[1:19:05] i said
[1:19:07] last night god will give you the desire
[1:19:09] of your
[1:19:13] god to let you walk in permission will
[1:19:16] instead of walking in perfect will
[1:19:18] because why you won't listen to him
[1:19:25] and even though
[1:19:28] god might save you but you're going to
[1:19:30] go through something you're going to pay
[1:19:31] something
[1:19:32] for disobedience
[1:19:35] praise god god gonna correct you but you
[1:19:37] might not want to take the correction
[1:19:39] down the road you're gonna realize that
[1:19:41] god gonna straighten you out
[1:19:43] because he knows them that he is
[1:19:45] and he ain't gonna let you just one one
[1:19:47] one but he gonna let you get learn your
[1:19:50] what listen learn your lesson
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:54] and god god knows how to humble us now
[1:19:58] and whatever it takes for him to humble
[1:20:00] us down god will let it come amen
[1:20:04] how many you ever gotta have a give a
[1:20:06] good
[1:20:07] spiritual weapon

[1:20:11] weapon
[1:20:12] if you ain't never had a spiritual
[1:20:13] weapon you just sat in that line

[1:20:20] it he said well i have one oh lord
[1:20:24] you must have just got saved yesterday
[1:20:27] because when you own this journey you're
[1:20:29] going to have many spiritual weapons
[1:20:31] because many times the holy spirit don't
[1:20:35] give that little nudge and say don't and
[1:20:38] you don't say
[1:20:41] you know
[1:20:43] i heard
[1:20:45] but maybe
[1:20:49] maybe not just maybe
[1:20:52] maybe maybe it wasn't

[1:21:22] i didn't hear that voice i i
[1:21:24] i don't know
[1:21:26] i just think it out loud that's just me

[1:24:02] uh
[1:24:03] the lord listened to brother simmons and

[1:24:10] time uh something uh sickness or
[1:24:12] something that happened to you well the
[1:24:14] bible said call for the elders of the
[1:24:16] church
[1:24:17] some of y'all
[1:24:19] take the elder as being the title
[1:24:23] are you with me
[1:24:25] but he said the elder women teach you
[1:24:28] what they not elders in the church
[1:24:33] but they're not a part of the five-fold
[1:24:34] ministry but the elder
[1:24:37] if you've been saved long enough you
[1:24:38] ought to be an elder
[1:24:43] you know ought not to be a bathe
[1:24:46] are you with me
[1:24:48] but you ought to grow up and be matured
[1:24:50] you know right
[1:24:52] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:24:54] that believe in my name they sh
[1:24:57] are you a believer
[1:24:59] so believers do what
[1:25:04] they cast out davos
[1:25:07] you know it's halloween
[1:25:12] the carving of the pumpkin and all of
[1:25:14] that is supposed to have been what
[1:25:16] witches did and and all of that
[1:25:20] bro gerard did i give you one of those
[1:25:22] no i gave it to brother chappelle
[1:25:24] one of my halloween things
[1:25:26] and y'all want one i'll give y'all a
[1:25:28] copy
[1:25:29] about halloween it's
[1:25:31] this is for the druids and the witches
[1:25:36] huh
[1:25:37] yeah and uh
[1:25:40] and that's what they do
[1:25:42] they usually sacrifice
[1:25:44] children
[1:25:45] on the on that time
[1:25:48] and so that's what it's all about
[1:25:52] and i'm saying to you don't get caught
[1:25:54] up on halloween
[1:25:57] you know
[1:25:59] get caught up on jesus christ
[1:26:02] this thing is late in the evening sun
[1:26:04] going down
[1:26:05] and you're not supposed to be ignorant
[1:26:07] of certain devices
[1:26:10] are you with me
[1:26:12] so they were doing a lot of bad
[1:26:15] stuff back then
[1:26:18] and it's still the richest day
[1:26:22] you know they still do the stuff right
[1:26:24] now
[1:26:27] on halloween
[1:26:30] i never told y'all about the
[1:26:32] two ladies it was converted from
[1:26:33] witchcraft and they own the bible
[1:26:35] bookstore
[1:26:37] and they tell me about
[1:26:39] a lot of the missing children they told
[1:26:41] me about that way back when i was a
[1:26:43] young preacher see a lot of the missing
[1:26:45] children they were offered up for
[1:26:46] sacrifices
[1:26:51] are you with me
[1:26:53] and they said the lord delivered them
[1:26:55] out of witchcraft
[1:26:57] heavy
[1:26:59] the material and the books that he
[1:27:01] should give me on faith and stuff like
[1:27:03] that
[1:27:04] i mean you can't buy them no more
[1:27:07] all the mom and pop stores
[1:27:10] that really identified all of these
[1:27:12] things that be happening you can't get
[1:27:14] that material no more the preachers used
[1:27:16] to preach against sin and stuff like
[1:27:18] that that they can't they can't come on
[1:27:20] television no more
[1:27:23] why
[1:27:23] the devil instead
[1:27:26] some of those big preachers got trapped
[1:27:28] by the devil
[1:27:30] and
[1:27:30] fell into sin and once they fell into
[1:27:33] sin they lost the nation
[1:27:38] so the nation don't
[1:27:42] because a lot of people had their eyes
[1:27:44] on the big preachers
[1:27:47] i'ma tell you something god won't give
[1:27:48] his glory to another
[1:27:51] so god will let man fall because he
[1:27:53] wants you to look to him
[1:27:56] even the prophet said the lord had to
[1:27:58] take me off the scene
[1:28:01] because the people had started
[1:28:02] worshipping him
[1:28:06] he said god has to take me
[1:28:09] because the people are worshiping me
[1:28:12] you see y'all caught causing me to be an
[1:28:14] antichrist
[1:28:16] y'all people y'all love me y'all good
[1:28:19] people but y'all causing me to be an
[1:28:21] antichrist
[1:28:28] he said don't do that
[1:28:31] i wonder what he'll say today if he was
[1:28:32] around
[1:28:35] i told those people not to do it you
[1:28:38] think they stop
[1:28:41] never came to get one brother tommy
[1:28:45] the point of the prophet said that's my
[1:28:47] god
[1:28:49] i said huh
[1:28:50] the man dead he's not my god
[1:28:55] i'm gonna tell you
[1:28:57] things happen brother sister friends
[1:29:00] you're gonna have to know jesus christ
[1:29:01] for yourself
[1:29:03] amen

[1:29:08] have our own personal relationship with
[1:29:11] jesus christ
[1:29:16] you can't the voice that you need to be
[1:29:18] listening to is the voice of jesus
[1:29:21] christ and he is the word

[1:29:46] too close to you the same
[1:29:50] you get too close to the mirror you
[1:29:52] won't even see your face
[1:29:56] because you're too close to it
[1:29:59] i'm gonna tell you something sometimes
[1:30:00] you have to back up
[1:30:03] and take a look at yourself
[1:30:06] take a look at yourself through the word
[1:30:09] and see where you stand with god

[1:30:33] disciples because you were
[1:30:44] the love got to be so great
[1:30:49] it can't be it can't be something we can

[1:31:13] because it's just gonna flow from you
[1:31:16] that love amen you couldn't
[1:31:19] somebody says
[1:31:21] i remember
[1:31:23] being a another minister was like
[1:31:25] brothers
[1:31:27] he
[1:31:28] he had so much caring
[1:31:31] i said man
[1:31:33] kill a hand
[1:31:34] he said i don't care that it'll be all
[1:31:36] right
[1:31:37] i said kill those ants
[1:31:41] you want to kill a fly you don't want to
[1:31:43] kill a mosquito you know
[1:31:46] you know you know he got so much guard
[1:31:48] in him you don't kill nothing i said
[1:31:50] thank you
[1:31:52] that thing answers
[1:31:54] in the draw hands in your
[1:31:58] everywhere
[1:32:00] i said i told you
[1:32:02] ants everywhere he never had to kill
[1:32:04] those ants didn't he
[1:32:05] see what i'm saying sometimes we can get
[1:32:07] too holy
[1:32:09] you know
[1:32:10] we can get so holy and you know in the
[1:32:13] wrong respect you know
[1:32:15] the answer take over sometimes so we got
[1:32:18] to direct our faith in a different way
[1:32:22] we can love god and have so much love
[1:32:24] for god but
[1:32:26] you know sometimes we the mosquitoes
[1:32:28] that bite you

[1:32:47] over your car all over your house in
[1:32:49] your shoes and everywhere pants
[1:32:53] and then you just wake up saying
[1:32:55] maybe you know
[1:32:57] maybe i supposed to kill that hand
[1:33:05] now i'm talking about ants
[1:33:09] the thing sometimes is things that we
[1:33:11] don't want to tackle
[1:33:13] because of the love that we have for god
[1:33:18] so we want to see everything just live
[1:33:22] and everything you know just to
[1:33:25] go
[1:33:26] be
[1:33:27] do his thing
[1:33:31] but sometimes it's some things that we
[1:33:33] have to
[1:33:35] tend to
[1:33:37] in our lives
[1:33:38] in order for us to have the peace and
[1:33:40] the liberty
[1:33:42] that god wants you and i to have
[1:33:44] some things you have to handle that god
[1:33:47] said i want you to take care of this in
[1:33:50] your life
