God I pray that you move now Lord did you heal you saved that you're set free that you filled with your spirit Lord in the name of Jesus Christ let it not be words but let it be the presence of your anointing that will come down and anoint your word in Jesus name amen seven and I read the first you'll read the next and we read the last verse together and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and a dragon fought in his angels ate and the Great Dragon was cast out that old servant called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him 10. and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death 12. um I'll tell you what we're gonna stop right there God bless serene's world you may be seen the devil knows that he has but a short time I believe his time is short now amen we can look Mike over 2 000 years for the uh uh the beginning of the church and the conception of the church and we can look at where we are now I believe we are in I believe the layout of the seal Church age and the prophet of God tells us we are in the broad age amen so by the grace of God uh you know people are saying because we have Sands that we say and you know quotes that we quote and it makes us feel better but amen but I want to just bring us down in in into reality form because all those Sands and all those little quotes is not going to make us or what we uh are supposed to be it is not because we say them we are what we are saying amen but there must be a manifestation amen of the sons of God that is a reality and an in manifested form amen it can't just be words that are quoted it can't be something that we say we believe it must be something amen when he said let there be light and that was like amen so it says it should be a manifestation of the sons of God and he said we're in the bright age but if we are actually amen don't have understanding of of of where we are amen then we are still in that particular layout of Steel spirit amen and we'll still fight against those spirits now you know sometimes you you must stay with scripture amen praise God you stay with scripture and let the scripture amen because heaven and earth will pass away amen but the word of God is going to stand are you up man so you stay with the word amen and you build your faith and your confidence off the word of God amen and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the Revelation amen of the word of God are you with me is to worry don't let nothing else amen move you away from the word so we said war in heaven amen now we know that we're in the end time the end of time or the end time amen the world is coming to his end and we are fighting for survival on every end a brother was telling about the Mississippi River drying up and amen food is about to go Sky High and everything is going uh I mean Haywire all over the world Amen people don't know what to do I know amen if the reality was told amen the world of being a great Panic state if they really knew the condition of the world Amen men would just lose it amen but we don't want to let it go and you know the political world and those that are in charge of the world system they don't want the world Amen the individuals to know what's going on because we are in a hopeless situation the world Amen is about to amen burn as an oven they're doing everything to try to spearhead global warming in this and the earthquake they can't stop the Earth from quaking they can't stop the uh painters from erupting they can't stop the things that are happening Amen in the world Amen they cannot stop it it's on a a a a course amen and it's it they can't turn this thing around so we'll fight in for Survivor amen they're fighting for survival amen it's it's a con it's a constant thing in the world we're fighting for the survival of a Christian's uh are fighting for survival because Christians are amen that are true believers in Christ Jesus are fighting for survival we find that other religions amen look like it's compassion what they call Christianity and the people are so care are so confused you know in the in the black community they're talking about the Hebrews uh you know what's black and and so forth and people will got a a chance to lift their head up and to look up because the Jews were black people or they're saying but uh you know is that reality what does that mean the Jews are black people amen what we're talking about the wall that we're fighting the battle that we're in whether the Jews were black whether they were blue or green you know whatever the reality form is that this battle that we're fighting this wall that we're in amen is a spiritual wall there's wall in heaven and and there's a wall in the earth so we'll find in a spiritual battle amen and and the wall that is going on in the war in heaven is the war in the mind we have Wall in heaven and the wall on the Earth amen the wall is in your mind amen it doesn't matter whether the Jews were uh uh black and the Negro in their plight and what they had to go through amen it model you know look like what the Jews went through but what is it what is that now what is that to us what it's going to do oh but does it give us eternal life do we have eternal life because we know that the thing that gives us eternal life to know that Jesus died on the cross are you with me and know that if we believe in him we should not perish but have everlasting life amen amen isn't that right but if we don't if we put anything above that then uh we're gonna shake his ground amen but when we've taken uh taking emphasis off of Jesus Christ then we're in bad shape amen praise God that's some said Jesus was you know discolored that that don't mean nothing right now let all those folks that fight about that be caught up in that what I want you to know is the character and the life of Jesus Christ amen I want you to know the day is a life that amen has a new birth that is available to you and I and that new birth means everything are you up man amen and God wants to give you amen of his divine nature now as we said there's one Heaven there's a war between the battles of the adamant nature which is the uh came from Adam through sin that was a nature we call the sinful nature amen we call the counter nature amen and there's a wall against the spiritual and the divine nature of God and that battle is taking place in the mind so there's a war going on and we're in a battle so as we're fighting for survival the the the the the truth of the word amen he said when I come shall I find faith on the earth amen what would that means would that be any believers amen and you know the prophet talk about one in a million are you with me so here we are we are we're at the point amen that if he did not shout in the days no flesh would be saved so we're at that at that Crossroad and at that time and at that hour amen that amen everything is going out of course we're fighting for family because amen if family is survived then amen then when men marry men they cannot produce and women admire women that cannot reproduce so we're fighting for the family everything is is at a at a boiling point if we had a place where amen we're threatened for the very existence amen because of the plant and the food and the shortage of every water and everything we're fighting for that and they're trying to survive they're trying to keep where we can have water to drink where we can have food to eat it's a fight for survival so as we come to the end of all these things brother and sister if we look to what the reality of the scientific world and for those that are in the authority will say it's no home but to you and I our hope is in Jesus Christ that he's the keeper of our soul that through it all we can depend on Jesus we can look to him to carry us through these violence in these situations amen God will be with us and he'll never leave us so as we said that we're fighting for survival of the marriage amen because marriage seems to be a thing of the past so amen they can you know you can just shock and just live with anybody you want to live with and amen then what what is going on the institution of marriage is being just messed all up we don't even know what it means anymore we don't know care amen about it no more in that people amen have given up a hope amen of having a decent marriage in life and amen the reign of children and so forth it's almost that we're hopeless we've given up on it the world is saying there's no use amen because amen let's just live together let's just do this let's just do that so what is it if we if we go over the course that we're going in amen then the world is going to be in such a bad shape the Bible says in the days of no every imagination the thought of men Hearts what's continually evil amen have we come to that place where every imagination their thoughts of men Hearts have become continually Eve off amen have we could accepted the evil of this evil age the God of this evil age amen have we accepted the world Amen in this world and listen and we accepted it war in heaven there's war in the church praise God the devil is fighting against Heavenly places amen there's a war going on in Heavenly places the Bible said he's made us to set together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus as that wall took place in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels amen I want you to know amen the wall that's going on within you amen praise God now if God has delivered us from the power of darkness and he's translated us into the kingdom of his dear son then you are actually amen he said the Kingdom of Heaven is not meat and drink but it's righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost are you with me so if amen the heaven in which I'm talking about I'm not talking about going into the seventh Dimension but I'm talking about in this Dimension that you live in right now amen praise God Amen God has placed you amen as children of the light in the kingdom of God are you with me now there'll be one time if they amen will move from the sixth to the seventh Dimension and we'll be in the place called Heaven amen but amen what we have to come back down here because he's King a kingdom Lord of Lord and Master will die this time restore the kingdom to Israel there'll be a thousand years Reign after we have caught up to meet him Amen to him amen and the Battle Is Over of Armageddon are you with me we'll come back and live on the earth for a thousand years and a thousand years to finish then John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth come down from God out of Heaven prepared is a bride and known for her husband are you with me so things are going to take place amen there's going to be a fire there's going to be a burning again Satan amen amen praise God it'll be over with amen but one day amen why he's still here and why he's still around I want you to understand what you're fighting I want you to understand amen your adversary your enemy I want you to not be ignorant of Satan advises amen but he is a deceiver he's very deceptive and he's trying he's the best to deceive you amen because he wants you to hold on to something that's going to fade away that's going to burn up so let's go to Ephesians 6 and 10. Ephesians 6 and 10. he says in Ephesians 6 and 10 he says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord amen so it is talking about if you're going to go to fight a war I want you to be strong I don't want to fight with somebody that's just we can go run when the battle is Raging somebody that's gonna hide and somebody gonna start crying and weeping I want you to be strong in the law but you know you got those folk amen when the battle begin to rage they go to running and hiding amen but he said be strong in the Lord in the powers now see Revelations that you love not their lives unto death amen I know amen it's all right for me to die because what I'm fighting for is worth dying for amen what I believe is worth amen standing up for man they met the God that I serve amen I'm not going to let him go the God that I serve I'm the hold on to his unchanging hand praise God I'm not serving a God Amen Hallelujah that's a weak God I'm a servant of God that promised I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you always and if he's with us then I know the amen the supernatural presence of God Amen they're probably God said that day at Calvary he said to you we all got to come to our vocabulary each and every one of us got to come to Calvary amen our cavalry amen we got to come to that dead Calvary we've got to come to the place amen that if we're going to have a new birth we've got to have amen a new birth through Calvary your own Calvary they remember your thought and got to Victory well you're willing to die for what you believe praise God hallelujah when you trust God and you're taking up your cross and you're following him brother and sister you got to come to that Calvary amen amen will you lay down your life amen praise God because you know you got a better one amen so he said finally my brother and be strong where in the Lord and in the what power of his mind not yours you see brother amen we're trying to be strong oh somebody's strong Amen Let the weak sound strong Amen Let the pole sound rich amen I want you to understand your strength is not your own but life is not known Hallelujah praise God your strength is history and if you walking in the strip of your savior your lord then don't worry brother don't you worry sister amen because you're walking in the strength of the Lord the Lord is my life Amen in my salvation the Lord is the strength of my life Whom Shall I Fear praise God what you're afraid of brother what you're afraid if the Lord is my helper amen I would not fear what the enemy is going to do praise God don't you feel what the devil can do to you amen oh Lord I got to get there he said be strong in the Lord and and the power of His might put on the what the whole arm of God that you might be able to what amen I'm telling you what to do if you want to stand I'm telling you if you don't put on then you won't stand but he said put on the whole arm of God if you want to stand amen if you're willing to take a stand against your dad the devil your enemy then put on the whole arm of God but if you don't put on the harm of God you won't stand but if you put it on it's available to you you can have this armor amen I'm giving it to you if you want to stand man yeah yeah amen that's what he's saying amen put on the whole arm of God that you may be a stand against the walls of the devil the tricks the devil got a lot of tricks he got a lot of scheme he got a lot of deception but you'll be able to stand why because you got on the whole arm you don't have just on a little piece of it but you got the whole thing on amen some folks just put on a little bit of God but he said for the 12th verse 4 we wrestle not against what amen don't ever look at flesh and blood as being the one that you're fighting against amen but oftentimes amen it looks like we're fighting against one another but but we'll rise and not against what and you're not wrestling against one another you wrestle not against flesh and blood but you're racing against what okay so the war that took place in heaven Michael and his name just fought against the dragon and his angels now you remember when Daniel was praying amen if something happened amen and Daniel the amen somebody came to help amen because the king of purging and the king of Greece amen these demon powers amen was Henry and amen the answer that Daniel was praying for and amen looking for God to answer here amen but he he he realized that he was in a battle that there was a war going on in the spiritual realm and and while that war was going on in in the spiritual realm he said in Daniel Amen you don't have to turn then said he nor thou wherefore I've come unto thee and now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia and when I am going forth to load the prince of Grecian shall I come shall come but I will show thee that which is noted in the scriptures of Truth and there is none that whole with me in these things but Michael your prince amen so he realized amen why Daniel was praying amen he was held up for 21 days I'm gonna tell you something amen because the Walt took place don't you never amen uh I don't never doubt God that he didn't hear your prayer amen but the war going on in the Unseen Realm they met the Unseen realm there's a battle going on and the devil is trying amen amen to conquer your mind amen he's trying he meant the
