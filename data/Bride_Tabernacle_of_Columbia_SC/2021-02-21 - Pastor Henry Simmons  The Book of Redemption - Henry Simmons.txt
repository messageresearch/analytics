one and i saw in his right hand of him that set on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong anger proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither the look their own and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and the loose the seven seals there and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and on another four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it were had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth may god bless you readers towards you may be seated seven eyes and seven horns the horns represent his powers the eyes represent the seven seals of messengers amen so by the grace of god i want to talk about the book of redemption this morning amen we sing the song i've been redeemed i've been washed in the blood of the lamb the book of redemption amen let me continue on at the seventh verse here it says and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set it upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hops and golden vials full of odors which are the what the prayers of the saints amen your prayers mean something amen i say your prayers mean something and when you pray things happen amen god amen praise god moves amen he says in the ninth verse and they saw a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou will slain and has what has what has what you see what it means it means something to us because amen this book dealt with redemption god has redeemed us thou art worthy amen you were there amen praise god no man was worthy in heaven and earth beneath the earth angels none of them was worthy but thou are worthy amen it was one that was worthy amen praise god such to heaven searching earth beneath her and nobody was worried amen but he said god always glad that somebody was worried this morning to take the book because it's the book of redemption amen because he said and you redeemed us are you what man redeemed us to god by what by thy what by the blood amen it was because of the blood of jesus you redeemed us by your blood what would we do without the blood of jesus just where will we be without his blood but thank god for the blood hallelujah praise god hallelujah the his blood made it possible for our redemption and when we talk about redemption or to be redeemed it means to buy back amen and one place it says to release on receipt of the ransom amen to release by paying the rams in price to redeem amen praise god the price has been paid praise god you don't have to go to hell now amen you don't have to be lost now amen praise god because the price has been paid praise god amen when the prophet of god talks about the seven seal brook amen praise god that abstract type of deed that adam lost that went back into the hand of the original owner are you with me praise god that was the book amen praise god that went back in the hands of the original owner i ain't met because adam lost praise god he could not amen praise god eat of the tree of life and live forever amen he was put out and there was a guard there before the the terror beings guarded the way to the tree of life amen and amen to the to the power amen that god wants to restore amen dominion and power back to the church back to his people back to the human race praise god but we couldn't get back when he met because it was that terribles were there they meant praise god and how god servants say amen it was matthew mark luke and john they met matthew wrote about him as a lion as a king they meant mark wrote about him as a servant as an ox amen because he remembered the living creatures that before the throne of god one had the face of a lion one had the face of the ox one had the face of a man and one had the face of an eagle are you with me praise god there was guards to keep you from that book god in honor amen praise god to get back to god amen that was a way that god had provided for this day for us to get back to the tree of life they meant to eat and live forever praise god man ate up the tree of knowledge good and even died now we can eat of the tree of life and live forever jesus said except for man eat my flesh and drink my blood and have no part with me amen praise god i want you to know amen it's time to eat again come on amen they may take the little book and eat it and they should prophesy it again oh it's time for the they meant for us to come into our redemption rights amen god amen has redeemed us to give us our rights back rights back to have dominion again praise god god gave adam dominion gave him amen authority and power amen but he rented his dominion in power when he listened amen they listened to the devil's lie amen praise god and the devil could not get the book but it went back in the hand of the original owner amen praise god the thief come to kill the steel and the destroyer but jesus said i come that you might have a life and that you might have it more abundantly amen the bible said he's redeemed us to god by his blood out of every nick out of every kindred tongues people and nations we've been redeemed brother sister amen praise god it doesn't matter amen what nation you are in what kindred you and god has redeemed you and ah amen he was worthy to do it glory to god i'm so glad the word is the lamb when they saying word there's the lamb it ought to mean something to us praise god because nobody could do it for jesus amen praise god so when boaz amen had to re redeem amen praise god was the kingdom of redeemer amen had to redeem uh naomi amen the rights of element leck in the book of ruth amen and when he amen praise god god had to pay for redemption rights he was able to when he amen got the rights amen to amen that inheritance they meant he was able also they meant not only uh the army but he was able to get him a gentile bride ruth oh you look man so he was a kin near kinsman amen in order amen to redeem you had to be a kingdom in the redeemer praise god and then if you were a kingman redeemer you had a right amen of redemption amen to buy amen your fellow brother or fellow kingman property amen so by the grace of god amen because there were no angels ken to the human family are you up and now amen and every human that was born of a woman born in sin shaping and iniquity nobody could be worthy amen to pay the price praise god man had died amen and god requires he meant the blood amen praise god amen the man that sinners he got gotta die but here's one that did not sin neither was god found in his mouth what was you and i amen the price and the penalty of sin is death but somebody paid the price the penalty the judgment that comes on the human family amen god wanted to redeem humanity back and to give him his authority in power in his redemption right spot brother and sister amen the book of redemption amen praise god god redeeming you and i amen he said nobody was worthy amen but worthy is the lamb amen as you said his redemption is in the two-fold one he purchased and one he claims are you with me so he paid the price amen for you amen your redemption but he has to come to claim that which he paid for are you with me so it's claiming time now you in claiming time to come back and get your redemptive rights your redemptive rights amen what the blood amen praise god what the blood paid for you have a right you have a right to tell the devil i got my inheritance back amen that what you stole i got it back now god you don't have no power over me no more praise god sin shall not have dominion over you anymore because sin has been abolished by the death of jesus holly knew y'all took care of the sin problem amen he paid the price amen praise god you don't have to be a sinner amen praise god because god has justified you through his own blood he's redeemed you by his blood he's brought you back amen that you don't have to stand with the guilty conscience before god hallelujah you can stand before god with your conscience amen clear justified as though you've never done it hallelujah why amen because it went back oh that old devil amen praise god that it went back and they charged to the devil praise god so by the grace of god god for knew you before the foundation of the world amen god saw you there and in that he saw you there amen he made provision for you there amen he knew that one day you would need amen to be redeemed and god in the mind of god they met because he looked and he didn't see anybody that could redeem man praise god never nobody could do it so amen here it talks about leaving the mediator in the intercessory part and stepping out payment of the throne and name it the lion of the tribe of judah prevails to take the book and that john described the lion of the tribe of judah amen he talked about that he saw as it was a lamb praise god the lion becomes the lamb praise god and hear the lamb come he meant to take the book because he was white because he had died he was slain are you with me jesus was slain his blood had paid the price brother and sister i got to read a little further because sometimes the devil don't want you to act like a sinner praise god don't you know he he brings all kind of things back to our mind look what you've done look what you've done praise god but thank god that amen i've been washed in the blood of the lamb praise god hallelujah i'm so glad that you know when i look at what is taking place in the day that we're living in amen that's been acclaiming and they've been restored of the redemptive rights and we know that we got a right to tell the devil amen you're defeated hallelujah oh i got a right my healing is my right my redemption right amen i got a right in hallelujah hey god you can't make me down him i know too much about it praise god i gotta i gotta read on because i i won't get tense and he said here in the 11th verse he said and i beheld and i heard a voice of many angels around about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands they mean a lot of men oh god it's good amen don't you worry about a thing ain't that god gives us angers charge over you amen you got ain't just looking out for you praise god amen as elijah said they that was with us amen amen his servant couldn't see him but god said open their eyes amen and open his eyes and let him see there was angels all around brother and sister don't you amen fear not little flock amen because god let his angels and camp round about you praise god god is watching out for you praise god you don't have to fear what man can do to you amen you don't have to fear anything amen because god has given you amen rejected rights hallelujah the book amen hallelujah i'm so glad that he was worthy to take that book praise god what did it mean okay he

about a thing these riches mean more as brothers are talking about on friday these the riches of god mean more than anything that the devil could offer you isn't that right you're rich in mercy riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing i thank god for his blessings i'm blessed this morning i'm so blessed i don't know what to do because uh god got so many blessings that folks don't even want the blessings of god you know but thank god that you have eyes to see and it is to hear what the spirit says to the church glory to god that you are blessed people like god you can enjoy what it means amen hallelujah to be redeemed amen job that took his counter that took everything away from him ain't that praise god that took his children took everything that job had job lied down with balls and everything shows all over his body but yet he said ain't been doing slamming yet i'm gonna trust him amen because my my revelation that i have of god i know my god is real amen i'ma hold to god's unchanging hand amen i don't care what i have to go through one day i know that my redeemer hallelujah oh my redeemer lives hallelujah ah i believe job had a revelation of redemption because he knew that the redeemer lived and he knew that god yes amen amen he's going to look out for him amen he knows the day that he was going to stand upon the earth amen he talked about the skin rooms he displaced yet in my flesh shall i see god amen amen he said he called one day and i answer amen praise god i know i got to get my redeemer live praise god hallelujah amen i believe he had hope of eternal life i believe he knew that he had eternal life amen on the other side so this one amen i'm not afraid what you can do to my body but you can't destroy my soul remember my soul is resting hallelujah oh we got our soul is satisfied hallelujah you can have the whole world wow but give me jesus amen jesus he's sweet i know he's sweet i know thou called me rod spawn me with me but i found a savior and he's sweet i know hallelujah i know my god is good hey man praise god well that's why david can say oh taste and see that the lord he's good amen he's good praise god hallelujah well it's good it's good to know amen praise god what if that book with a stain in his hand and nobody was able to take the book amen praise god what if you amen he hadn't come forward to claim they meant redemption claims amen praise god he was worthy to take it because that means that somebody amen god was looking and john was weakened and he was crying because he didn't see nobody and john knew if nobody didn't step forward they meant the redemption amen oh the judgment amen and the price amen had not been paid but if the price had been paid in the blood why should it then there had to be somebody wanting it amen to take that book and when they took that book amen that means amen redemption i'll come to claim amen the judgment you know how the judge have it on the book you've done so and so on it's going to take so long amen but praise god if somebody has paid the price for that then you will have to go to jail and you don't have to die amen because somebody has already died in your place are you with me so the record shows the judgment amen judgment was written man saying man got to die that's what was in the book right but god made provisions for adam a slain lamb and gave him skins to put cover the necklace isn't that right and able recognized that it was blood that was needed to cover his sins are you with me and the book had talked about the blood the blood the blood when i see the blood i'll pass over you isn't that right it was redemption plan all the way through amen the blood had to be shedded but remember animal blood could not come back on the spirit amen the life of the flesh is where it's in the blood and animal life could not come back on a human being it took human blood amen innocent lamb amen though that lamb was a dot spot without blemish it could not give you could not pay the price angels he said jesus when he rose from the dead he said for a spirit has not flesh and bone did you see me here amen because the blood had been shedded isn't that right so jesus blood was worthy because it was pure blood everybody that was born of a woman born in sin shaping the iniquity why because the blood was contaminated amen but jesus was born of a virgin because the blood the seed the egg it was pure are you with me so he could pay the price amen though he didn't do no wrong though he the bible said he that knew no sin was made sin for us he did it for you and i not for himself but he died for us amen if we can receive it god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever what believing in him should not what but see some folk want a parish they don't they don't believe so they perish because they don't what believe it but if they believe that jesus died for their sins then they don't have to be a what they don't have to be a sinner amen because jesus died amen to loose you and to free you from your sin so why be a sinner when you don't have to be a sinner are you with me but some folk oh no i can't help myself the devil made me do it no jesus made a way for you to have authority and redemptive rights and power over the enemy are you up man he i gotta i gotta close in a minute here he said in every creature which is under heaven and the 13th and on the earth and under the earth and much such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i say blessing and honor and glory amen and power be unto him that set it upon the world throne and into the lamb forever and ever amen you know i like what he said he made us priests and kings unto god that that means god has he put us on a elevated state he made you kings and priests unto god and that's through the book of redemption now in closing i want to talk to you i i don't have time to turn to the scriptures i do have time but i ain't going to take your time are you with me so in the scriptures and daniel remember micah stood up amen and he said let's just go to daniel 12. i just do that okay daniel 12. and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince that's which stand it for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as neville was since there was a nation even that same time and at that time thy people shall be what delivered isn't that right and everyone that shall be found written in the book it's very much that you written in the book he wrote your name in the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world your name was written now which the book had to be claimed somebody had to be worded to get that book out of the hand are you with me that's judgment with a structure praise god but because the lamb was worthy to claim your name that was written in the book are you with me but remember it was sealed with seven seals it had to be a time when the sealed book had to become an open book because it was claimed to open up to you it meant that you were there before the foundation of the world are you up man amen god had to show you where you were you were
