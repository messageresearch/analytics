children tonight Lord move in a mighty way father for we love love you and we appreciate you we can't say that enough God for Your Love In The Name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen want to look at the Book of Job tonight Job 1 by the grace of God and six very familiar familiar scripture amen try not to be long tonight Job 1 and6 you got it say amen and it reads now there was a day when the sons of God came and came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant Jo that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that fearth God and is trueth evil then Satan answered the Lord and said does job fear God for not has not Thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he have on every side that thou H has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went from the presence of the Lord may God is blessed to the reading of his word tonight may be seated we want to minister just for a moment on a little topic and I I entitled it the Hedge amen the Hedge it's little something that the Lord you know put on my heart when we're talking about a hedge you know how how Satan told God here in this place he says you know job is only serving you because you got a hedge around him he says not only do you got a hedge around him but all of his house and everything around him and everything he touched you're blessing and that's the only reason why he's serving you so you know look at a hedge a hedge is is something like a boundaries you know or or or the fence that's put up to keep things out so I was thinking about that here the devil here is even testifying that I can't come near job because of boundaries that you got around them and I thought about that you know even in our individual lives that's what I going to title tonight the Hedge in our individual lives you know we're on we're unconscious sometimes we just go about our daily business but not thinking about the Hedge that God has around us you know and and in that like we says in that hedge it to realize that the devil can't come near you he's got boundaries amen that he can't do but so much to you am because of the Lord got a hedge around you and I begin thinking about that you know one day I was in prayer last week and I said Lord I think I thank you for the Hedge that you put around us you know what the devil does is he Bluffs and tries to get you to come from behind what fortifying you then he can have his way with you but other than that here he is testifying that I can't do nothing because you protecting them hallelujah amen and I thought about that I said God you know just thinking Lord thank you for your protection we're so unconscious of just how good God is to us amen amen of the the Bible you know was I was thinking I said you know sometimes you know uh uh he what he was implying that you know job is only serving you because of I can't get near him but if I can get near him you know I'll he I'll make him curse you to your face come on but God had confidence in Job that job ain't serving me for that I'm blessing job because I know what's in job's heart job going to serve me through the good and through the bad job going he he going to maintain like they say his Integrity through all he's going to maintain this integrity that's why I'm blessing him because I know what's in his heart and I thank God that a lot of times you know everything we do sometimes the way it looks might not come out right but God has the ability to look beyond what the natural eyes can see and that's what stumbles Men A lot of times because of sometimes God blesses the most unlikely of people or God protects and watches over the most unlikely of people but that's because God is looking at something that you and I can't see what he's looking at a lot of times is the the seed that he planted before the world even began come on and he knew that one day the light would flash across that seed and you'd be quickened and you'd come until what he ordained you to be before the foundation of the world that's why he told I believe Jeremiah at one place he says to him he said says don't say you're a child he says because this day before you was even formed in your mother's womb I've already set you above Kings and King I've already done that they put I put them under your feet because I know what I put in you come on and God's got to sometimes we don't even believe what God is saying to us amen he says I know my thoughts concerning you in one place and they're good and not evil come on somebody sometimes you look at yourself and say oh God ain't moving God ain't blessing but God know his thoughts can concerning you God's got to encourage you sometimes to let you know that even where you are right now you're still an overcomer you overcome because I've already overcome for you get up and fight don't look at the circumstance that's surround you hallelujah amen it's a hedge there hallelujah amen the devil's got certain boundaries he says you know I can't go near him because of the Hedge I like how even the devil testifying not only him but his whole house amen come on amen God blessing your whole house things could have been worse but God didn't let it be worse because somebody praying amen hallelujah God got respect on your prayers so he'll bless them for your sakes amen I believe that amen hallelujah he says everything he touched come on you blessing him amen I like that to hear the devil testify that amen everything you te touch Lord God you bless them that's the only reason why he's serving you but no God knew what was in his heart that's why God was blessing him God knew he wasn't serving him just for gain but he was serving them because he loved I said do you love God tonight come on your love for God will be there when you don't when you have and when you don't have amen when you feeling well and when you ain't feeling well your love for God will be there want it whether you got a job or not your love of God will be there want it come on and God know that that's why he can bless you amen that's why he can protect you and keep you hallelujah amen oh Jesus but the Hedge I says a lot of times we're unconscious of just the the presence in the angels that are around us come on you know your faith invites angels to come near y'all believe that tonight come on we're unconscious of the spirit realm what's going on around us but what God has got to do is make us conscious of that Hallelujah and when he makes us conscious of what's around us we'll be we'll watch then what we act how we act you'll watch what you say you'll be conscious because you know that you don't want that hedge to leave you don't want to do nothing to offend the presence of God because you need it every day and every hour Lord I need you oh Jesus come on I like how job job was conscious of that hedge wasn't he that's why even when his children was getting together he says he was going to do things in advance I'm going to make a sacrifice in advance just in case amen come on amen God because we going to need the head just in case they do something I'm going to go ahead and make a sacrifice Hallelujah am he was conscience wasn't he he knew that he needed the protection of God somebody said job you're a mighty man you got all this wealth and all this land and all this wisdom and everybody coming to you but yet he was still making sacrifices to God Amen because up somewhere he knew that he was nothing without God somewhere he knew that God took his hands off Hallelujah somewhere he knew that didn't he oh Jesus and you and I know that tonight God if you take your hands off us oh Jesus it'll make you get down in prayer it'll make you call on the name of the Lord just in case hallelujah amen Adventure hallelujah oh Jesus come on I thought about that you know you know getting up early rising up early in the morning and praying it it is something that's most well needed in your life sometimes you might over sleep but get up jump up and you just go about your day not conscience of what's going to take place that day but God is so merciful anyhow ain't he but when he puts it on your heart you don't just I I was saying the other day I said a lot of times you know we wave the spirit of God off we wave the presence of God off I said one day you wish you had to waved it off one day you'll wish that you hearkened to the voice that you heard and you got down on your knees and you cried out before it too late one day you'll wish come on but it's the Hedge I says Lord you know you you getting up I said RIS up early you rise up early to pray because you don't know what's getting ready to take place that day so you praying that God send your angels before me Lord amen Let Your Presence go and cleared away Hallelujah because the devil remember he was was walking to and fro seeking who he may devour now that's what he was doing looking for a life to destroy amen hallelujah and he'll destroy those lives if the Hedge ain't there amen but God keeps the HS there hallelujah amen oh Jesus the devil don't care nothing about you amen amen I can't say that enough tonight the devil don't care nothing about you am you think the devil your friend the devil ain't your friend amen he wants to destroy your life amen hallelujah amen destroy your soul but the mercy of God hallelujah amen amen is keeping us and watching over us from day to day from hour to hour minute to minute God Is Watching Over You hallelujah oh Jesus you know something was ringing out in my spirit uh that little scripture from The Book of Micah he is saying what hath the Lord required of thee old man he says but to do justly come on to do justly to love Mercy come on we so we so quick brother Gordon got it walk humbly before thy God we so quick to do things but I said Lord he said what is he required of you do justly come on watch how you handle things Hallelujah come on love Mercy I I don't know about you but I love Mercy Mercy rewrote my life Hallelujah when I was on that somebody saying today Ernest we glad you came to the other side Hallelujah Mercy rewrote my life I said if God wouldn't have brought me to the other side I wouldn't be here today amen I know I wouldn't with the mind frame I had I wouldn't have been here amen but Mercy rewrote my life Hallelujah wasn't me finding God but God found me one day he am in my sin just where I was at Hallelujah come on but the Hedge I thank God for the Hedge you know what it is I says that when God's got a got a hedge you know that ought to make your faith rise to another level cuz the only way to he just like even for him to get past that hedge God had to say okay he had to give the devil permission you could do that but what God already knew what job can handle what he could bear amen so you look at your situation a little different hallelujah amen that if God allowed it then he's trying to bring something out of me he's showing me something in this situation and I know that I can overcome why because the Overcomer is in Me God brought me to it he'll bring me through it I believe that amen hallelujah yes Lord oh Jesus come on amen God does those things don't he the Hedge he's got boundaries that he can't cross we don't realize it but this is real now amen we sitting here angels are here Hallelujah Jesus is here how you say that because the Bible says that where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst can you see them tonight Hallelujah he's here come on you know I I says that what it is it it it it's the Hedge Hallelujah I thought about Elicia and and Gaza on the mountain that day come on though the syrians and the Army was all around them it was a hedge there come on they could see it with their natural eyes their enemy but Elicia could see something that nobody else could see that's why he can have confidence in faith in the midst of being surrounded cuz he know that a hedge was there he know that Angels were there amen hallelujah and they can't do nothing but what God allow I believe that and that's in the face of sickness that's in the face of death anything say that might come your way you feel Victorious because you know that God's got it all in control he's got it all in his hands I ain't worried about these things I believe it was Paul said these things don't move me Hallelujah I'm steady I'm founded on a rock oh Jesus Oh Hallelujah Jesus the Hedge come on he put a hedge there you know and that's the thing I like how I was I was looking at that we're saying about bound boundaries come on this one guy at work was was talking with him and and I says a lot of times you know he was saying that his sister he said you know my sister sees angels He says one day when the preacher was preaching she she clear up and down she see angels all around he thought it was a joke but I told him I said I believe it we got scripture on that I said the angel of God is encamped about all that fear him come come on Amen I said but I believe in angels I said you taking it for granted you saying you laughing about it but I said I believe she brought it she might have didn't see it I believe it come on I said the reason why you can't believe cuz you're not a Believer Hallelujah I says but God's got to do something one day in your life you know there a lot of people sitting in church that don't believe amen but God's got to do something in your life one day amen come on Amen that you ain't just listening to the testimony of the preacher or mama or Daddy but you seeing it for yourself now nobody can't take it away from me amen hallelujah I heard but now I see am oh Jesus those type of experiences will stick with you the rest of your life amen come on Amen they will but we were talking about you know things and I was saying you know I was saying you know you don't realize you know that even the Bible says in Ephesians when we were dead and trespass and sin come on God still took care of you didn't he come on I was saying the other other Sunday riding down the road storming and raining but I said I I was I was meditating and dwelling right here in this I said the angels of God are encamped about them that fear them come on you don't trust in your driving skills because your driving skills will come ton not if God take the Hedge down come on don't trust in your Youth and your age come on because God the devil will strike you if God move a hedge don't trust in your money come on don't trust in nothing you got is not by might nor by power but it's by the spirit of the Living God that's what it is oh Jesus I like that little song everything is moving by the power of God Amen and the devil don't like that Hallelujah walking to and fro waiting on a little crack that he can get in but God's got all the cracks filled up amen oh Jesus I thank God for that you know what it does it takes fear out of your heart come on it takes fear away from you the devil Ed these eyes and these ears these senses to cause you to fear come on and the Bible says fear got torment don't it come on but once you realize that the devil's got limits he's got boundaries he can't do but so much whatever the Lord allow him to do come on he's a puppet in God's hand I believe that God is you know I was singing that little song and to myself in prayer Our God is an Awesome God Amen He reigns Heaven and Earth wisdom and power come on and love our God is an awesome God come on where is the fear then it ain't nothing come on there why because we recognize who God is come on Amen we recognize what he's capable of we recognize Hallelujah his majesty that'll make you praise him that's why you love him so much that's why you don't want to leave ever leave out of his presence cuz he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but many of times we come from behind the Hedge it ain't that God moved it but you come from behind it come on then your blood will be on your own head come on but I thank God tonight don't you thank God for the Hedge come on the devil got boundaries I thought about that night in Egypt Hallelujah when the death angel was coming through but he had boundaries didn't he come on he said that you you take the blood and and put it on the door Post in the Len he says when I see the blood I'll pass over you the death angel had boundaries didn't he come on it was a hedge there that blood was a buffer a hedge to keep the death angel out amen wasn't it come on and the blood of of of of the natural animals and all that can do that what about the blood of Jesus today when it's applied to your life when it's applied to your home no sickness no death no trial tribulation will be able to enter into that buffer Hallelujah only what God allow and if God allowed it that's cuz he about to bring me out stronger Hallelujah when it's over with I'm going to be stronger than I was when I went in I'm going have a testimony that'll shake the world upside down Hallelujah why because trusted in God oh Jesus hallelujah oh Jesus come on the Hedge aren't you thankful for the Hedge tonight come on I like the devil said I can't do nothing to him cuz you got a hedge around them come on everything he touched uhh you bless me come on he's got favor with you I like that come on that stirred me up that the devil was telling God that I can't do nothing to him come on don't you think God cares about you like that tonight God's got no respect the person he went to distance come on came down and died went through all of that because he loved you amen cuz he desired to save you because you are a part of him that was missing and he wanted it back hallelujah amen so he was willing to go to distance amen for you and I what are we sad about what are we worried about what are we fearing about he conquered death Hell In The Grave didn't he do it yes he did come on oh Jesus hallelujah hallelujah but we we're not conscious of it some lot of times are we he just going about our natural day but even in those times God still protects you am come on you know God just wants somebody to praise him is that too much to ask somebody to give him glory is that too much to ask come on on somebody to say Lord thank you for blessing me somebody to say Lord thank you for what you did on Calvary is that too much to ask you Lord come on out of you and I I said no Lord that ain't too much to ask I want to do it every day I want to do it every time I think about it I want to give you glory Hallelujah with all that's in me oh Jesus I like that brother s saying a lot of times I I be saying it to the sister or the brother whoever says I'm on my way to heaven and I'm enjoying the truth come on that's the truth though ain't it come on but it's it's the Hedge you know you we we unconscious of what's out there you unconscious of the battles that's taking place in the spiritual realm we just casually going about our day not conscious when you going about your day the devil's setting all kind of traps come on Amen but God has got a hedge about you just uncovering those traps Hallelujah the things you can't see you already took care of you walked and didn't know that was your last step Hallelujah you didn't know that's the last time you get in your car and drive you didn't know come on if God would have moved the Hedge but God didn't allow the devil to do that to you did he he's merciful tonight Lord yes he's merciful Lord come on Lord but we wave his Mercy off we throw it away I'm My Own I can do my own thing don't take the Hedge away from us hallelujah oh you'll find out how weak you are then just like Samson he found out didn't he come on but it's the Hedge you know I thought about so many things you know the prophet of God was bringing out how he saying that you know the angels of God are encamped about them to fear he says they don't go back and forth but they en Camp there they're staying there Hallelujah they're there all the time they don't go back and forth it won't be a time that the devil catch them off guard but they in Camp they stay in there Hallelujah they've been given a charge by God to watch over you Hallelujah so they in Camp they staying there in the middle of the night while you all sleep they staying there Hallelujah when you just walking they stand they there watching over you Hallelujah making sure you all right making sure you got food to eat Hallelujah making sure you got money in your pocket making sure you got water to drink making show Hallelujah I believe that Hallelujah come on they ain't went nowhere they stay there oh Jesus but I saying you know I just want to I just throw this in there was talking today and uh at work and it's it's young man out there he lik to watch horror movies with his daughter and I done told him I said something till several times about it you know cuz it's hard for people to tell you the certain things you don't say nothing about it but I'm praying for him but it's this one guy he's a little lot younger than us he says uh when the guy was talking about an exorcist or something he say man is guy he's only 22 years old 20 22 no 225 or something he says uh you ain't supposed to watch that and he went and and repeated everything I was been telling them for the longest he says you watching that thing he says those demons get out the TV and they come in you and he began to talk about how you put curses on your own life cuz it's some things that he know about he says those people those witches on there doing those spells those things you think they just that's just an act or a script they casting spells on you they throwing all kind of thing he said you watch those things with your eyes they get in your spirit that's why you can't sleep at night that's why your relationship in a mess oh it felt like he was a anointed cuz he was going on and on talking to this boy right but and I told him after he got done I said see y'all thought just because I was from the country I was superstitious cuz this this guy he's from Hartsville I said see they think we just superstitious but that ain't the case but I think I think the other guy got through today though cuz I say what it is you be careful right you shouldn't watch none of that no way it scared me to death [Laughter] so I couldn't watch it but you got you got to be mindful these things you know the devil's got all kind of traps all kind of things he's Conjuring up to have you messed up amen get all things in your spirit you don't know how it got there you don't know why you got certain desire and certain craves I always say don't say what you want do amen cuz God take his hand off you'll do whatever the devil tell you to do because he's your master amen the Bible says we walked that way that we were all by Nature the children of Wrath you had no other choice but to walk that way because the devil was your master amen hallelujah so you don't say the depths you won't go you don't know where you'll go Hallelujah but I thank God for the Hedge that when those demons those Devils try to get in God's got a hedge there and I don't know about you but I'm going stay behind the Hedge am I'm going stay under the blood where the world the devil can't do me no harm Hallelujah and I believe in that tonight come on I said the Hedge be conscious of the Hedge that God has got around you you know I was studying this and looking at this I started walking different I started feeling different because I said I know I'm blessed Hallelujah I said I got favor with God I know I'm blessed the devil can't put no more on me than what God allow because of the heds that God got set up about me come on I started praying every day Lord even for the children I pray for them always I said Lord watch over them in the school let the Hedge be there amen bullets might go to fly whatever might happen God let the Hedge be there come on I pray for the guys at work God bless us today nobody don't get hurt nothing don't I said Lord let the angels of God be there come on you bless job you bless him in his house and all hallelujah amen because of the way he walked before you I said God let me walk before you and be pleasing in your sight what have I required of the old man amen to do justly come on L and I thank God for that you thank God tonight the Hedge [Applause] amen I was talking about brother Shifty Williams and I said he said what does the Lord require of the old man to do justice love mercy and to walk humbly before God God Amen that's what he would always say and then I thought about brother Ernest say he scared of those like demons riches I remember me and him was in Louisiana and I want to get on the other side of the street because I I felt some Demon Spirits coming and brother Ernest I said brother Ernest you see that what the name of that gameat Mortal Kombat I said man look all those demons coming off of that building he said he said I used to play that I see you there what I said man you can't feel all those demons I said man those demons is so strong and it was just like death you like hell I mean those Spirits coming you know what I'm saying some of y'all might got them in y'all Y let me see who looking at on come back how many y'all been playing come on up here and get those Devils cast out you you got Mary Magdalene had Seven Devils don't be ashamed she had seven she was glad to get them cast out Mortal Combat demons I'm calling them out they've been identified y'all want them out or y'all going to let them stay in okay Mortal Combat some of the strongest demons I I done cast out a lot of devils but I got I want to get on the other other side of the street and he told me he played the game and I said oh man let me get I don't even want to walk past the building and you a tell me you played the game ain't felt nothing man God I don't I don't see how people I remember Caleb when he was when he was little it's just anything would get him and Rachel what you what's wrong with you because and then but he was real sensitive to Spirits he was real sensitive it's better to be sensitive when some Spirits ain't right can they not be sensitive some people don't know the spirit world is there and some people are sensed to the spirit world some people the spirit world just engulf them just take over them and you wonder why children act like they act is because those demons sometimes it's sexual demons and and those demons never leave you those demons are there you have to battle those demons the rest of your life because they come back they keep coming back and they want to inject themselves into your life they CA you not only to look at things they C you to do things that you wouldn't normally do had those demons not gotten in you they had to get an inlet that make you do stuff that you never would have thought about doing but because you entertain those demons those demons were able to inject themselves into you just like brother Ernest said said put spells on you they put spells on you turn ball in the to Toy Box you say you found it okay sometimes I want the parents to go back over some of those books we used to have they tell you about those demon spirits and toys and so forth there was a book we used to uh let the parents read turmo in the toy box there was several books dancing with demons that was another book and that was talking about the music it and how it was injected from um sometimes the different singers would go to Africa and they con you up spirits and they put those spirits and they tell you to play certain records backwards just playing back and you'll hear the them demon spirits and they'll tell you bed and you didn't even know existed you think you listen to some innocent and demons they worshiping the devil demon spirits that was dancing with the demons I had all kind of books like that you know why you know where those books at now anybody know where those books at now they make sure you don't get none of that they closed down all the mom and pop stores people used to sell that kind of material and Bible book stores you see all them about closed down you can't get the material no more so I'm saying to you the devil was successful I I guarantee you can get all satanic stuff you can get it all over the place when we come down to things that uh expose the devil take it off the market or you can't
