how many believe you leave this place with a miracle I believe the miracle working God is in the camp the same God that was Moses is the same God is here tonight the same holy spirits that was with

tonight I am thrilled to be among you tonight Simon was in Miami not too long ago and he blessed us with the word of God and we said we have to come to get four more yeah we come with a big boss and I would ask that the central Miami would stand at this time uh so that you can see them amen where are you God bless you amen we gonna um uh be with you thank you maybe seated and we know that we are glad to be with this set but most importantly we are at will to be with the Lord Jesus Christ it says here wide of Tabernacle of who Jesus Christ so he is here and I believe that the blessing that he gave to Naaman he is here to provide it to each one of us this man had an incurable disease leper he was suffering from leprosy and uh when he went to see Elisha he thought Elisha was going to come out to talk to him but Elisha did not come out he just said gehazi his servant to speak to him you know gehazi was someone that was inner in the Inner Circle the message come from God from the angel to the prophet and from the prophet gehazi was a commissioned to distribute it to the people and hazis thought that he doesn't need to talk to the ministers he'll just gonna give the message to everybody he's just going to make it available to the entire bride and he came out and he told them what the prophet had said he says this is the word of the prophet gehazi represent somebody some kind of organization who is close to the prophet who has the ability to distribute the message worldwide but you see when he came he said we don't need any Minister little did he know that uh nahaman was not going to believe his message the bride was going to resist and become reticent until the servant to wear with the bride started to try to persuade the boy he said I'm gonna go back home I have better rivers in my house in my country we may name two rivers type of Baptists or Pentecost or some kind of protestant and Catholic we have Rivers we have partisans we have Cavalry he name two of them I'm gonna go back home and uh bathe in those rivers and wash myself over there but the life was not there the life was in obedience to the word of God and the servant said listen if you had asked you to do something difficult you would have obeyed him that's a type of the five full ministry the other one ministering to that rebellious men you see a lot of us hear the message but if you don't have the fivefold ministry nobody will ever obey the message so God sends his servant faithful Ministry to help us to believe the word let's stay with the word may God bless you praise God Amen I

walking with God I'm walking with a word that I know is going to translate me absolutely not prolonging the time I thank God for a precious brother Simmons and pastor of the church here all the ministers and their wives I've gotten my wife with me tonight amen so I thank God for her traveling with us God gave us a good trip I must say so myself my wife and I have been married 46 years yes and uh we were we were looking at some of those younger younger pictures of ourselves I won't tell you what I thought about me but I'll say this one thing for certain it won't be long now I'm looking for a body change let us go by the grace of God to Joshua 24 13-16 I hope I didn't leave anyone out we appreciate the musicians I know it's hot so I've been already told you know don't don't don't preach to midnight I appreciate that I I can be long-winded but I just trust by the grace of God that God would give us Grace I really wasn't supposed to be here uh on this weekend we we were to have a wedding in the church uh there in Iowa City but some changes were made we we did the wedding last weekend and so I thank God for that because at first it was canceled or postponed and then they changed it again and then it worked out all right so I appreciate brother Simmons for sticking me in here amen I would have come anyhow yeah so by the grace of God um we love the Lord some of you know me some of you do not and I trust by God's grace that somehow the Lord will bless you we're living in the last days and we've heard that so many times we've heard it we've heard it we've heard it and we've heard it all over again but for some reason I I don't think it's getting to the people uh the urgency of this message it is an Urgent Message it's a it's a message we should never allow to become common and uh it's it's a it's a matter of life and death uh it's it's not religion we've had that for 2 000 years it's it's beyond uh organization or denominationalism it's not enough to be a member of a church or or to be a part of a congregation but the question is have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed right we're moving to perfection and the god of Moses Elijah you name it that same God is here today yeah let's go on Joshua 24 so I appreciate the Church of God brother Simmons his wife and family they have always been very kind to me to be honest with you he's been more than a brother uh all I can say is that I truly love him and his wife and family as a special place in my heart I don't say that to be saying it it's really what it really is but let's go on with the word of God Joshua 24 13-16 like our brother uh was saying you know we want to see God in action I've seen Miracles I've seen signs and wonder some things I don't tell because I just figured people won't believe in any way but you know I know that the God I serve is alive and well amen Joshua 24 13 and I have given you a land for which ye did not labor and cities which ye Bill not ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and of the olive yards which ye Planet not do you eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land ye dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods one more scripture Joshua still Joshua 2. beginning at the 18th verse but when we come into the land thou shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou did let us down by and thou shall bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren in all thy father's household come unto thee and if it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thine house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and he will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in thine house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him let us pray our heavenly father we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and Lord what can we say we thank you for your election we thank you for your predestination we thank you for the sight in which you have given unto us God there are so many that desire to see what we see and father we praise you because you have given us eyes to see the day and the time that we're living in I pray tonight Lord that you would break and destroy the Yokes of the enemy I pray father God that you go beyond the minds of the people and go down into the depths of their hearts that they may seal God and understand what is required of us in these last days in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated Hallelujah when we think about what God is doing I don't know whether everybody can see it and maybe I'm just late a late Comer but I can see and I can understand what God is doing in this day and the thing that excites me more than anything else is because it's personal I don't have to wait on a group I don't have to wait on my neighbor or my uncle or brother it's something that God is doing in me now the Bible said in that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father's in me and I am in you is that right so we know that there's a relationship that's happening right now and this relationship amen has a purpose we are there as I said to my church the other night this is the last episode for the Gentile y'all better hear what I'm saying because a lot of us know what episodes are right when we watch all those stories on YouTube and all these things they always bring it in episodes and every time you say well I know I'm spending too much time on this thing I'm not going to do it again but then that last episode that you look and listen to makes it more exciting and then you say oh God one more time y'all hear what I'm saying but at the end of it all it comes to an end and sometimes the end it's not what you expecting it to be you're disappointed because you was expecting something some kind of excitement some kind of explosion but then at the end of the whole thing it leads you null and void hmm now I want to tell you about my God and when my God wrote This Book he not only wrote the book but he was able to step into the book he's the author he's the finisher of this book and so we know by the grace of God when God talks about book a book or door those things are symbolic and every time you hear that he's speaking of himself Hallelujah for an example in the church age when God said there was an Open Door what was it God had was revealing himself in a measure to those people of that age is that right so you must understand those people of that age would never have gotten what God was to say to that age unless they had the ability to see it and to receive it y'all hear what I'm saying because though they preached in that day everybody heard but because you hear it doesn't mean you understand it and doesn't even mean that you receives it because the word of God is only given to the elected of God they're the only ones that has ears to hear eyes the sea and a heart to perceive y'all hear what I'm saying and God don't care if you are prostitute if you're a whoremonger if a dolphin if you are a true Son of God when the word of the Lord comes to you it somehow turns the light on somebody know what I'm talking about see we are not worthy to hear this word we're not worthy for God to even call us by name but God In His Infinite Wisdom Hallelujah before the foundation of the world the Bible said he put my name in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah that's why I'm here today not because I chose God but because God chose me Hallelujah God chose you Hallelujah we come to worship him we come to praise him we come to let God know how much we've appreciate him Hallelujah like I say I'm just going to help my brother we ought to make the devil nervous we ought to worship so hard tonight because you know he got all his heat here he figure you're not going to worship so if you faint at least you faint in Jesus name huh it's worth it Hallelujah glory to God now we're looking at this thing you say oh brother before he was saying we find out that in the beginning the word was closed according to Daniel is that right seal up the book then you all of us know that but at the end time then you say it's going to speak have you ever seen a book speak let me say it like this the Bible says in the Book of Genesis that the voice of God walked in the cool of the evening have you seen a voice walk it was always God and it always will be God Hallelujah nobody understands this book like God understands it and in order for you to understand it he must reveal it is that right this is why he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Hallelujah is that all right so we look at this thing and I'm gonna get to my message in just a minute but we find out when I was in school there at the University of South Carolina I actually and and that makes me nothing if you listen to me talk you find out it sounds like I've never had an English course in my life but the truth of the matter is we had composition and the first composition I wrote I did bad on it right so I had to learn what was in the mind of my professor now God gave me that wisdom so I went to his office in a subtle way I said sir could you please teach me and show me how you would write this I'm about to help me so I watched him how he corrected my paper and from that time on I wrote with his mind and not my mind and I aced the course somebody help me here see this is why the Bible is here this is why the Bible says let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus because if you have the mind of Christ you'll understand the book Hallelujah and the Bible says what we have the mind of Christ now I'm coming because we come in the last day we've gone beyond the church ages hello now I don't know about you some of y'all might be in later this year but God been I've been smitten I've been brought out I've been immune out Hallelujah and I'm in another age I'm in a call it what you want to I'm not here to agree theology but I know I'm not in laodicea so if I'm not in there to see where are you brother I'm in Christ Hallelujah and when you are in Christ you are in the Capstone oh y'all Hallelujah see what I'm saying but I'm coming to something and I'm going to be long it may seem like I am but I'm I'm bringing you something because I'm gonna tell y'all something I'm giving you the honey now this is honey the bit of Power is coming right so you know by God's grace we're in an age where you have that they're Where We Are love Divine love is your goal y'all hear me not brotherly kindness which many of us stumble with all the time but Divine love and this Divine love as our brother said is a creative love a love that you that that's moved by God to create things is that right now you say I'm in the message well this is the message Hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you your will will never make it happen Hallelujah and not even your own voice will make it happen this has to be inspired by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but if you're not in the Holy Ghost how can God talk to you or somebody help me here see because I want you to understand that the holy ghost or what we call the token is above every one of yours Covenant what yes because you belong to us doesn't mean anything it could be the group you could have the greatest Pastor ever but that doesn't mean anything token must be applied y'all hear what I'm saying I read by the grace of God Israel had to have a blood sacrifice y'all hear me and that blood had to be put on the doorpost and the little in in other words it had to be placed on the heart it didn't matter whether they were Israelites circumcised on the eighth day it didn't matter whether they were the tribe of Judah or The Tribe of Benjamin whatever the tribe would have been would have been another fact if the blood wasn't on the doorpost God don't care whether you're Baptist he don't care whether you're Methodist he don't care whether your Pentecostals he don't care whether you're Apostolic he don't care whether you message the blood must be applied Hallelujah I'm talking about the blood of the Lamb yes sir it has always been the blood somebody help me here it's always been the blood but now people get so sophisticated they said well it's not the blood not literally you're right but it's the life of the blood Hallelujah is that right you see if the devil had only understood who Jesus was Hallelujah he's never would have crucified him oh my God if he had only understood the Redemption plan he never would have crucified him he says understood his position in the scripture somebody help me here he knew what he was sent for come on somebody this is I'm coming to you because if you call yourself the bride and you don't know what you come for what are you here for you're not here just to dress holy or to come to church like everybody else does Hallelujah you've been chosen a god to be a reflection God somebody help me here so when God saw when somebody see you they supposed to be seeing Jesus Hallelujah is that right when you're walking down the street the world must know that you are a light somebody help me here glory to God you say well what do you mean brother Brooks listen it wasn't even the lamb I knew I was going to get your attention it was the blood of the Lamb because the lamb just packed the life of God y'all hear what I'm saying but that body could die but the god in him could never die somebody help me here that was God's own life in Jesus do y'all hear what I'm saying and then Jesus said it's good for me to go away because when I go away the father will send what the conference who is the comforter oh come on somebody the Holy Ghost and who is the Holy Ghost that's God so if God is in you you're supposed to bring forth God fruits Hallelujah like I was telling my church The Day of the tree of knowledge and good of Good and Evil is over Jesus said you make the tree good or you make it evil right God don't want no mixed Christianity makes part Christianity and part of the world oh God don't want that kind a bloodline his bloodline is pure is that right just like the man of God says when we receive the Holy Ghost God gives us another DNA he gives us a blood transfusion okay I wish I would have brought my papers here too brother y'all didn't heard me testify how God healed me from cancer Hallelujah so I had to get some more insurance and now so they still had that on my record and I'm like I'll take the test I'll take whatever you want me to take I don't have cancer hello they took all the tests there was no cancer oh wait a minute I'm not talking about cancer in remission I'm talking about no cancer at all [Applause] I got my papers I wish I would have brought them with me see the same Jesus that was with Elijah is the same Jesus that's in Elisha Hallelujah but I'm not concentrating on that I said we've got so many people who are Christians but don't live the life y'all better hear what I'm saying I'm trying to get you to see we at the end of this thing this is the last episode for the Gentiles hallelujah what this is over God don't revisit the Gentiles no more he goes back to the Jews y'all better hear what I'm saying many heard this message many heard this word but they've been so dollary so lazy so distracted come on somebody I know what I'm talking about you know what many of us have married a system that's what it is we have become a system we sang the same songs we shout off the same songs we y'all hear what I'm saying but when it's all over where is Jesus where is Christ Hallelujah because when God is in the house everybody have love one to one another don't tell me that you are a Christian and you can't forgive Hallelujah the very Foundation of Christianity was based upon forgiveness Hallelujah when Jesus died on the cross what did he say he was birthing the bride father forgive them for they know not what they do you say prove that because when Stephen was being being stoned the same inspiration that was in Jesus was in the inspiration of Stephen and he says Lord oh not these things to their charge what was it it was he was in Christ and Christ was in him Hallelujah Hallelujah there's so many people out there you don't even understand it's benefits from for serving the lord [Laughter] it's benefits my wife and I was coming down the road I think it was 321 and they had a big poster sign up talking about something about gonorrhea well they weren't talking about me that's the benefit of a Christian we live a holy life we live a Sanctified life I was telling some friends of that my I said you know what if you look at my life it looked like a real boring life but I'm not bored I come home I go to church I go to the store I do a little activity and I'm back home y'all hear what I'm saying and I don't have a big old screen in my house oh yeah that's what what we we we we're going to watch the message or we're gonna y'all get real how long does that last is that all right what what I'm bringing this today that he said listen if you go out into the street he's not responsible and I'm gonna tell you something what I've been seeing or what I'm seeing even in the message churches people are literally dying spiritually just dying like it they dress like it but there is no life where's the old Saints y'all remember the time even in the Pentecostal church we serve God so well that there were times a glow would come over your face when the last you see the glow [Music] somebody help me here that's the truth when God is in your life and you are in God it manifests itself yes sir the Bible says that when when Moses came down off the mountain the glory of God was so over him he had to cover his face somebody help me here see because you got to realize this is not some joke it's real [Music] when I see the blood and the token can't be put on your shelf either you don't you say oh I got the Holy Ghost but you don't even have a prayer life oh I got the Holy Ghost and I don't even read my Bible oh I got the Holy Ghost but I don't even listen to message tapes no more oh lordy Hallelujah you've been deceived huh because I'm gonna tell you something when you listen to the word you feed the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and some says Lord Give Me Back My Joy be real Joy it can jump Hallelujah but real Joy is when it comes from the heart in the time of sorrow in the time of adversity you can still scream it is wild it is well it is well all is well Hallelujah you better make sure you got the real Holy Ghost Hallelujah you got to get the real one not the Baptist one not the Methodist one ah not the Pentecostal one not the message one y'all know what I'm talking about because the message people got their own too now Hallelujah they got their own I don't know but I know one thing about it seem like all sheep act the same it's the truth and you know the nature of the sheep never changes the Holy Ghost never changed and we've gotten to the place that I got a lot I could be quoting and all that but I'm being led this way you know we we got to the place till we let people dictate how you worship and you let them do it where is the anointing of David [Music] when Saul's daughter stoned him he said no no no no this is not going to happen let me tell you something if I'm shouting and you grab me that's the worst thing you could do because when I'm done you're gonna think I had a real demon trying to hold me back so we don't do that in here what are you talking about the god in me got me jumping the god in me got me running the god in me got me rejoicing Hallelujah when the Bible said when the Lord is in his Temple let all the Earth be silent y'all hear me so when he's in this Temple you have no right to criticize but we don't do it that way in the message keep that this old quiet religious method of stuff now I yes I'm sorry this but nevertheless you know how people do Hallelujah oh God been to you and then when a sister get up there Hallelujah you're trying to determine whether she got a devil or not what if that's the devil let him praise God [Music] the token is something the token is not some third person or second person it is the person it's God and God acts in a peculiar way he'll make you do things that you thought you'd never do every time I read Ezekiel I think about how God's Ezekiel said God took me by the heads of my hair and lifted me up y'all believe that I believe it now he was translated see sometimes we think see that's what people don't understand I'm looking and I'm expecting this translation translation a man can take you from one place to another on the Earth and also translation can take you from Earth to heaven y'all hear what I'm saying so for an example explain to me when Philip baptized the eunuch and after he baptized the eunuch Philip was caught up can you imagine what that unit must have felt when he saw the man who was with him disappeared that's not Old Testament that's New Testament that's not denominational food that's fried food because the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe Hallelujah choose you this day Who you gonna serve let me tell you something the devil on the steel kill and destroy you y'all playing those games with him I'm gonna tell you something he's smarter than you we've heard that so many times you give him an inch he'll take a mile hallelujah oh you backslaughters don't you know when you thought to leave God you thought I'd come back at a certain time it ain't that easy the devil just don't let you go it takes the mercy and grace of God to loose you from the Devil what she was once with God and now what the devil will take you right on down to the pig swine have you slopping up with the pigs Hallelujah until you come to a realization this is not who I am y'all hear me that's what this message made me know that when I was a sinner I thought that was me oh come on y'all I know you did some of us he used to have that say I'm trying to find myself not not even realizing you're saying I'm lost huh but that yeah you look at me and see some of y'all don't know where I come from and you know what you don't need to know but I'll tell you why I was a wretched right and I was one of those sneaky kind hey those are the worst kind somebody know what I'm talking about those are the worst kind because even when you when you get saved God has to take all of that out of you he must purify you he's got to sanctify you Hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord y'all pulling me this way dude amen but see you we we look at this thing and I love Joshua because Joshua is a type of Jesus right Hallelujah and I love Joshua because what did Joshua do different than Moses Moses did everything and people came all from all over the world just to see Moses perform but when Moses died something happened the commission changed it was now given to Joshua and Joshua included the people y'all hear me it wasn't just Joshua alone it was Joshua and the host of Israel Hallelujah so let me say it like this it's not just Jesus alone it's Jesus and the host of Jesus which is his bride we are here to conquer how the world is going to know you different if we're going to mingle with them Hallelujah you love the Lord see I believe my eternal destiny is to be a full grown son of God a son that is now being trained a son that is now amen going through the process because you understand the word right if you don't eat the word then your body can't materialize around it right is that right you say I'm in the Rapture well let me say it like this or translation however you want to say it when Sarah and Abraham they had a word promise right and so they believed it they didn't do anything to turn Young it was the word y'all hear me and who is the word Jesus Christ it was Christ in them changing the elements of their bodies as they walked with the promise somebody help me that's what's happening now we're walking with the promise and the promise in that promise he's changing us I don't care how my body may look but on the inside there's a change going on and one of these old days that Change is Gonna drop this whole nasty body and take on the theophany and change the amen with a glorified body I believe that Hallelujah but let me get back to one thought because some of us still believe or denominational Grace they couldn't give you all of it you didn't even have to you didn't know what Grace was until you understood what the election was an election is a higher calling than Grace I can give Grace to anybody right but that don't mean they're elected somebody help me here but because I'm elected my grace is greater than other Grace y'all hear what I'm saying my grace is unfailing Grace oh my God you gotta understand talking about [Music] now you don't know what I'm talking about but let me tell you a week or so ago I took a week to myself fasting praying I'm not boasting but I had gotten into a slump very tired and weary still studying still praying but something was going on that I didn't like here here so I my wife allowed me to go the church allowed me to go follow me a place to go I went to that place fasted prayed sought the Lord and the Lord said to me you forgot you forgot this is why you responded and you've acted in the way that you've been acting because you forgot I said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you and he goes on to tell me I drew you with the Everlasting Love you know what God did for me he took me back to my childhood way before I knew anything about God and began to show me how he protected me here protected me there protecting me here protected me there protect he said that was me Hallelujah and nothing I love toward you my love is a perfect love Hallelujah my love I give to you you don't earn it you don't deserve it but I gave it to you it's an unfailing love that's why we can't move on look at it Peter denied Jesus three times Judas once and Peter still hold held his position oh let me say it like this and I'm almost I I just feel like I gotta say this one thing I love about the Book of Esther no I'm not going to preach on Esther but uh the king's word could not come back boy oh see once the word goes out he can't change his law that's powerful because God before the time made a law and Vindicated that law by writing your name in the Lamb's Book of Life nothing the King has decreed it nothing can change it nothing can vorted out somebody help me here right nothing convert it but see we still under that kind of Grace Lord if I do this if I do that the Bible said in that while we're here yet sinners could die for us Hallelujah even when he gave you the Holy Ghost he knew the mistakes you were going to make Hallelujah like I tell people I said I'm gonna tell you he's a friend that stick closer than a brother Hallelujah there were times there was no friends around but then a song come to my heart yes Jesus Loves Hallelujah do you think that was the devil that was God Hallelujah when I looked on place and you made a mistake then all of a sudden God starts ringing that song in your heart there's power in the blood Wonder working Power in the Blood he's always ways before me somebody help me here because you're going to have to know who you are I don't know about you but I'll say it like this God has made me his son and he can't even change his mind about it God has made you his son and daughter and he can't make he can't even change his mind about it Hallelujah you love the Lord Hallelujah let me read this Eternal Destiny is a choice maybe tonight somebody or some of you will make that your choice of where you expand eternity right hello but he knows your choice I can remember when the word of God came to me through my friends I said oh that's for you and not for me I didn't come right off to the Lord I read from him but he chased me Hallelujah and guess what I had to come to a near-death experience in order for God to wake me up I was in a club and I said Lord don't let me die like this if you spare my life I'll be in church the next week I give my life to you Hallelujah he spared my life Hallelujah that next week I would go up to the church day Progressive I hope that don't offend nobody I come in the back door promised a friend I was gonna come have my little afro and all that you know when you got a nice afro you don't want to get wet I go in there and who I see with brother Simmons now y'all don't I I thought I knew him I really thought brother Simmons was a rough character anybody that come to school amen dressed in a three-piece suit white with a hat on and all that stuff you know they're dealing something [Music] that was the way I looked at even he told me he didn't do it but in my mind he said he don't remember this part but when I walked in that door and I saw him I said if God can save you he can save me and I'm gonna tell you this if you hadn't known the kind of Life I Lived you would have said the same thing if God can save you he can save me Hallelujah let me move on too long yet Hallelujah so we we it's a matter of life and death and you and I must know for certain what and who we are this is not time to be guessing you can't guess this thing it's got to be real it's not in a song it's got to be in your soul if that makes sense you understand me Hallelujah now we understand when they were making that's why it's so important because the Covenant like I said Israel was under Covenant and they said okay I'm circumcised on Eighth Day you know I'm circumcised and so I'm truly truly an Israelite that meant nothing to God when God turned the corner and began to talk to Moses and said Moses this is the new ordinance slay a lamb put the blood on the doorpost and the lentil and the Death Angel is passing oh come on somebody you know what we mess up because we see a lot of people dancing and shouting and praising God supposedly but let me tell you something you can do all of that and still be dead is that the truth you know when if you don't obey the word the death angel is going to get you I hope this is all right this is what he told me to preach and here I am because it is a serious time you've got to have more than speaking in tongues you got to have more than shouting you got to have more than running up and down the aisle and you know I love that all but you gotta have a life and that life has to be Christ we we're Beyond touch not taste not handle not we shouldn't even have to tell you how to dress we shouldn't even how to tell you not how to what not to work or look at all that nonsense that's baby stuff stuff y'all hear what I'm saying we won't Revival in order for Revival to come you must be sanctified you can't expect God to give you a Revival if your life isn't clean oh come on somebody I want the real deal Hallelujah I don't see Miracle after Miracle after Miracle but that don't save me when I see the blood when I see the token when I see Christ that's when I'll pass over you Hallelujah Lord have mercy I'm not interested in her name one of the reasons why I moved up to Iowa it's a it's to escape some of the stuff people in the message put on you you know they they classify you as a one as uh you know in the top ten what kind of nonsense is that Hallelujah you know they they you know they put you in this category that you know if you ain't a part of this that and the other you know you're not invited to preach I got a church matter of fact God then gave me two y'all understand what I'm saying so what happens how how I'm so concerned right we all I thank God for being here don't get me wrong but what I'm trying to say is I'm not looking for a name The Only Name I care about is Jesus Christ [Music] if I would have paid attention to what people say to me I wouldn't be dancing in the spirit no more I wouldn't be raising my voice and shouting huh oh God it's not about you it's about me and him oh Lord help me Jesus I got to move on by the grace of God see the thing about this is the greatest mystery ever and we must understand I don't know about you maybe I'm I'm crazy but I don't want the stuff I see the message is right but what people have done with it I don't want all of that no no no no I'm sorry but no I'm not I don't want it until I see the very life that was in the Elijah of our day living in US now I know we're not prophets but what I'm saying the same God must live in US Hallelujah that's the way I see it my wife and I a sister from Africa she speak French got real sick the other day a couple of weeks ago they found a mask in her they didn't know what it was they didn't want to cut on it because they said it might explode or whatever the case may be my wife had a book called the healing thoughts where prayers are there and and we went to the hospital and we had her repeat her son repeated to her in French what we were saying in English don't you know God healed that woman she was so healed they wanted to take her to Mayo Clinic to find out what happened they don't want to believe in a miracle not only did they God healed her but cleansed her blood completely every test they made on her came up clear and clean [Music] that's the God I serve dead dead but you don't heard me say that a lot you know God can be no greater than your revelation and the Bible said he that cometh to God must believe he's he's God he's first he's God he's God do y'all understand me everything is moving by the power of God Hallelujah right now you breathe by the power of God now you got to understand this mystery now it's no great it is a mystery that God in his creation becomes one now let me ask you a question how many of you have been working on that Lord make me one with you no matter what the cost no matter what I must go through I want to be like Jesus it's not enough to sing it it's got you got to mean this thing because when you meet it you're going to do some suffering hello you gonna do some suffering but look what the suffering is I don't care what I gotta suffer I told the Lord I don't care what I must go through as long as I know you there I know that you're there I don't care if it's a fiery furnace I don't care if it's a lion's den I don't care if this is chopping block as long as I know you're there I'm all right one day I was in my kitchen just thinking on the Lord and the Lord spoke to me now I hope he speaks to y'all but he spoke to me and you know what he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you my something happened in that kitchen I don't need no music to dance I don't need nothing to praise God I mean we praise God in that house that's why he told me you forgot when you worry you forget that God promised you he'll never leave you nor forsake you right when the bills get so high and you can't pay and you just worried worried worried first of all you done forgot who Daddy is he owns everything y'all hear what I'm saying I'm just going to share something with you I I'm off my nose but let me share this you know people have a bad habit of not praying tithing I'm sure y'all pastors don't have to deal with that and most of the time those non-payers always want you to pray for them and you know what I'm saying sometimes you want to say pray for yourself thank God you don't give me the authority to kick him out y'all look at me like y'all laughing but I'm serious I want my church to be blessed and the Bible said you're cursed with a curse Hallelujah okay now God has never left me nor forsaken me and here on on my YouTube and a sister from Illinois caught the word and from then on she's been kind listening to the word from Chicago and she wrote me and she said brother brother uh Pastor Brooks I want to bless you like you know I'm a little sheepish you know about that and she says no no this is what God wants me she said but listen all glory be to God she sent me a check of fifteen thousand dollars that was the first one y'all hear what I'm saying see when these folks who claim to be Christians don't know how to pay to I tried some one of my brothers say well how can I be uh how can I become successful and prosperous I'll say pay your tithing huh if you really want God to bless you believe the word you don't worry about bills God will come at a moment you expect him not to come oh my old grandma my own mama and I don't mean to go that way but no I'm not somebody's pulling me this way my old mama I love her she was a Godly woman couldn't read nor write but I think she was a prophetess or something because she had visions no she did and she tell me things and I was like how in the world she knew that but nevertheless my mama used to tell me Junior she know back in the day I still like to eat but back in the day I would love to eat I loved eating everybody knew they could get me with the food and uh yeah it's a sad story to that too I used to love so eat to eat so much my mom would give me her food that wasn't good but I didn't know that right but uh my mom said Junior the Lord then showed me y'all going to bring some food by this house because we were poor very poor y'all talking about my bathroom and my my change I want we didn't have none of that one pair of shoe and if that wore out you just was wore with the socks and everything hanging but my mom would say and this is how I learned I didn't see a real Christian until I saw my mama y'all hear what I'm saying she was Holy Ghost Field I saw it and you know sure enough I opened the back door going out and there were bags of groceries and to this day I don't know who put it there neither did my mama know y'all hear what I'm saying every time she and I'm talking to the young people when you got a Holy Ghost Field mama or Daddy they know your crowd and when they tell you that boy or that girl is not your friend you better listen [Music] you better listen because they're going to lead you into chaos I know what I'm talking about sometimes it took a period of years for my mama saying to come to pass but every time it happened I'm talking about the Holy Ghost now and don't you squint don't you quench it sometime we let church services quench us we come to church and we feel it all good and you get in there and they're singing near my God to thee because the song leader hasn't laid before the Lord get up there singing songs and ain't even an anointed I don't need that everybody that comes to church supposed to be anointed not just a song leader you supposed to be anointed bring in your lick of Fire Hallelujah I guess this is the first service always I guess it's all right for a foundation you know I'm looking at the people of God and I know how hot it is and I'm hot too and I'm sweating every but you know what I'd rather be here than in a club in Des Moines Iowa they just had this bicycle thing over 50 000 people riding bicycles In the Heat of the day half naked some of them y'all hear me but they believed in that and you can't even get a Christian to stand on a corner with you no more to preach the gospel that's why I learned to preach it wasn't in a Pulpit it was on the streets now you tell people about witnessing they look like they lost they don't know what to do when you witness for Jesus let me tell you what you do open your mouth if you open your mouth God will speak for you I'm almost done I'm almost done I'm sorry uh you keep pulling like that we'll be doing what I was told not to do see in my nose the whole thing is God and man one God and man that's what God wants one a wonders with man a Oneness and he the only way that could ever happen is that we must be filled with this spirit so I'm gonna say something because remember that Covenant changed with Moses and so we had the seven Church ages and God did a new thing so where is the blood now you hear me and the reason why I'm saying what I'm saying because if you don't follow the pillar fire you'll miss it Hallelujah because they're going to be a lot of people Mr rapture because they think they're under the blood Hallelujah see but the blood speaks better things than Abel y'all hear me and when you get people who say I'm under the blood and all they want is Revenge talk about people backbiting all these negative things well you're not under the blood of Jesus Christ oh come on somebody check your yo yo your salvation look into your soul look into your heart it's later than you think it's the truth and you and I must know who we are if I die right now I know where I'm going you got to know and because you young Don't Mean a Thing young graves are out there too all graves are out there too right religion won't do it oh I follow Prophet it doesn't matter Millions followed and we're dead Hallelujah you love the Lord I'm trying to get her somewhere I know this sound Elementary but that's what he wants me to say because we've got to come to a realization we can't fool ourselves no longer your education Ain't Gonna Save You because you know all Mysteries won't save you either if you don't have love or charity for your brothers and sisters forget it what are you talking about well see they go over to that church what do you say when that church became the church you know who the church is you are Blood Washed Holy Ghost filled there are no walls with the New Testament Church the draw the True Church of God don't care where you assemble Hallelujah if you name the name of Jesus Christ we are on the same side see I knew I wasn't going to get too many from the preachers but that's the truth there were things in Corinthians that that Ephesus didn't agree with right throughout the church two men ain't gonna believe and see the same thing but we do have one thing in common that is the calvary that is the blood of Jesus right and that organization that denominational Spirit if you're not careful of it will send you straight to hell now I don't care who you are the truth is the truth you got to even love the unlovable this got to be different it cannot be the same see it's the truth like the word of God said think on these things because the truth of the matter is we're too united we must be United it's a system it's a system we develop and your system better than mine when they are wrong when Israel developed a system God said you stink in my nostrils you even listen let me ask you a question when the last time you had communion how many times you where were the weepers were anybody crying and broken you understand me communion ain't just taking wine and eating bread it's sacred and there's supposed to be some heartfelt something in that and if you're not feeling it you just systematically doing it that's the same with worship I should never have to say oh raise your hand you know what I'm saying I should never have to say oh y'all stand up and clap that's insanity that's not the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost came they were jumping out of Windows running up and down the streets saying he's alive he's alive he's alive nobody you can never be a real Christian and a shame of the Holy Ghost you got to let go God let go and let God have his way we don't got so starchy I love music but music is not what turns me on Jesus the name of Jesus oh my God how sweet is the name of Jesus you love the Lord and it's the truth it's the truth nobody has no preeminence over here we're all one body we think about it if we would all unite under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost what we could do I tell my own church that I've got two churches most of them are Congolese people the saddest thing about that party is they all tribals different tribes hello I'm almost done because I can see you drying but my my my my point is this I told him I said it's a shame that y'all are prejudiced against each other that tried One Tribe better than the other tribe this tribe came Mario tribe hey I don't mean no harm y'all all black I can't tell no difference you know what I'm saying that makes no sense it makes no sense I get in trouble because I'm like Paul I preach against all that traditional things who don't mess with my tradition I said I don't care if you've got Traditions but don't make that tradition like it's the word yeah as long as it's your tradition keep it oh y'all y'all getting quiet on me but what I'm trying to say if you're not careful you'll pick up a church spirit and that church spin will become your tradition we don't need Church Spirits we need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost in fire Hallelujah the kind that don't care about what everybody else says but if God says I'm going to praise I'm going to praise you give him the praise Hallelujah Hallelujah people say oh I love the message and you don't even listen to the tapes and all that no more but you listen to your preacher how do you know he preaching you the right thing you don't read your Bible anyway oh come on somebody it becomes a tradition oh Lord help me Jesus you love the Lord I'm almost done look like God had me anyway when how many of y'all understand what I'm trying to say breaking through the system is not easy it's something I had to do I refuse to be a part of this system I'm gonna love everybody I'm gonna Fellowship where God wants me to Fellowship you're not going to have no walls around me I experienced that in that denominational Church you go over there you're going to be sat down well Set Me Down because if God tells me to go over there I'm going over there y'all hear me my my birth wasn't given to me by a man somebody help me here my birth was given to me by Christ Jesus himself maybe I'm out of line but I got to preach it like you tell me I look at this thing and I said hey we got to come up out of this people are dying what y'all gonna do with these young people that need God oh don't you know they they acting save many of them they act like it most of them are not and y'all know it but as parents what are you doing you better get them to the Holy Ghost oh they're fake speaking in tongues on you they know how to do it because it's a system and listen people I know what I'm talking about because I had daughters to do me that way I literally thought they had the Holy Ghost when they didn't have it y'all understand me this is a serious time a very serious time and and I'm like Abraham I don't want to leave nobody behind but I'm gonna tell you this and I'm gonna close if you want a Revival you got to have a Revival in your home first then you bring your Revival from home to church right how do you know you get all out all the wicked stuff out of your house that's hard get all that wicked stuff all that Hollywood influence out of your house oh Jesus let me tell you something it's going to burn up anyway so you might as well get it out while you have a chance get all that Wicked y'all know what y'all know what you got it's the truth and and it's bad it's so bad that our children can be doing all kinds of evil stuff in the Holy Ghost Field House and you don't even know it where is your Holy Ghost your holy ghost sounds the alarm is that right when my children was coming up I could walk in the house and know it was a change I'm like oh what's that when something went wrong my wife would tell you I I looked at me first what did I do then I talk to her right and if we're both cleaned in what's going on Hallelujah we go hunting and I went hunting I opened the closet door and I found a bad book yeah reading looking at it whatever they doing and you know what my son told me he got it from a message believer's house y'all hear what I'm saying I don't took too long but my heart I poured into it I love the people of God I don't care how bad you are I still love you because God loved me when I was bad you all hear what I'm saying I tell my church I know some of y'all ain't doing right but I still love you right I'm not gonna have a bad attitude I still love you and I'm going to treat you like you you you're not doing anything wrong I'm gonna love you to death huh y'all hear what I'm saying how many times your mama did that or your daddy let's let's stand I'm sorry I just feel like uh I I just felt I can't explain it but I trust that that something was said tonight I tried to get to my notes and I just couldn't get to my notes but I say this to you we we're not indebted to the flesh but one thing for certain like that song say how much do I owe I cannot tell how much I owe God has been so good to us those of you who have traveled you come and God has blessed you with your strength your health do me do me a favor if if possible we got other ministers coming tonight make it your night rededicate yourself sincerely get before God we talk about seeing milkers I believe we will be able to see God move in that way if we can just clean up and and and get before God and come back tomorrow night or where you can do it tonight but I'm saying when you do come back tomorrow night come back with a clean slate you've confessed your sins you've done all you can do before the Lord so that when God comes through Hallelujah you'll be blessed I don't know what tomorrow is going to bring but I I just believe that this is going to be perhaps the greatest of all the meetings I believe that and and I'm hoping that and I'm not talking about the singing and
