that you would forgive us and help us to be reconciled back to you lord the hearts that were lifted the hands that were raised oh god there's so many needs lord and oh god we are needy people and god i believe that you dispatch angels god to help the poor needy in these times that we live in so god help us tonight surely god we are needy people we need your help lord we need your grace and god we thank you for it god i pray you will bless us oh god help us to move out of the way speak to us lord oh god help us in the name of jesus christ we pray let the church say amen amen god is good amen we want to look at psalm 51 by the grace of god try not to hold you along tonight amen i like how that song says when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock i thought about something i was talking to one of my brothers this week and last week at least last week and he was saying to me it's like man he said i just need somebody to talk to so i was talking with him he said you ever been like that well you just needed to relieve some something just get some relief just to have somebody to talk to and vent to is the word he used i told him i get like that all the time he said well who do you talk to i said i get down on my knees in prayer and i let it all go to god he said to me cause he called me germaine he said jermaine come on man i'm serious quit joking i said i'm serious i said he never felt that whenever i needed relief or whenever i needed answers when i just didn't know where to turn i told him i said now i can talk to charlotte my wife i could tell her anything and we can talk about it i said but when i needed real relief when i needed a real shoulder to crown come on when i needed to vent i said i did it dialed on my knees in prayer and i still do it now and i said he never he never failed me yet i said so you know i said that's what it is the power of getting down on our knees the devil he wants you to keep carrying them burdens he wants you to keep carrying them heartaches and that pain he wants you to keep carrying it and that's why he blocked your prayer life you believe that that's why he don't want you to get down on your knees and tell god about it come on he don't mind you telling everybody else because he know that they can't help you come on but when you tell god about it he don't want that because i like that song that says let god arise and my enemies be scattered because when god arrives all of my cloudy days come on they'll go away all my enemies will be scattered when god get up hallelujah do you believe that tonight so i challenge you i says that you know when my heart is overwhelmed as the songs say lead us to the rock i was challenging him i said you know just as you vent to me vent the guard that way and tell them all about it come on i said i i guarantee you he won't fail you do you believe that tonight amen psalms 51 by the grace of god you got to say amen and it reads have mercy upon me oh god according to thy love and kindness how many want mercy tonight he says according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin you may be seated we'll read a little further down it says in for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee be only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold i was shaping in iniquity and in sinned and my mother conceived me behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my enemies i like this in the 10th verse he says create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit in me how many want god to do that tonight come on restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee unto thee deliver me from blood guiltness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness tonight by the god by god's grace we want to just minister on to minister for a moment on restore unto me amen you know david here and we'll just we'll just skip down to the to the i say the meat part david said unto me david said restore unto me my joy come on david wanted his joy back you know we live in an age and a time i would say that where it's a lot of pain i was praying one day a couple of weeks ago and i couldn't get it out of my spirit i said lord that's a lot of pain out there it's a lot of hurt everywhere you you look it's pain somebody's going through somewhere i was sharing with somebody i said you know when you try to encourage this one and help this one get back level the ship then you turn around and look and somebody else is sinking i says but everywhere you turn it's a lot of pain but god you know he spoke something down in my spirit and he was telling me that he's the reliever of the pain come on that if the people would only come to him he can heal them everywhere they hurt and i believe that tonight a lot of times you know we could go to god and god could do great things for us reminded me of one time the king sent to uh think it was beelzebub or one of the other gods to see if he would be healed from the sickness he was in but when the prophet met him first thing he asked him he said why come on he says is there no bomb in gilead come on is there no physician there and if there is then why come on why aren't you healed tonight why are you going other places seeking deliverance come on and i said that even today god is still that same god god is still a healer he's still a deliverer isn't he ain't he the same yesterday today and forever i said is he still all-powerful then why aren't we healed tonight come on why don't we have the joy of the lord in our hearts why aren't we glad come on as david said when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord somewhere we lost our joy i was talking to brother damien and he was saying to me brother ernest he says we got to have fun with our salvation we got to enjoy being saved he said if i can't have fun being saved then it ain't no good to me come on because when i was out in the world i enjoyed being out in the world come on living for the devil well how much much more right now we have the joy of the lord knowing hallelujah that we found immortality that we found hallelujah the tree of life that we can eat and live forever we don't have to be afraid to die because we know what's on the other side come on we live in this life just so we can live and again live again i believe the song says living he loves me dying he saved me buried come on he carried my sins far away rising he justified him freed me forever and one day he's coming what a glorious day hallelujah what are we happy about because we know where we're going we know where our home is hallelujah and we know who our father is do you believe that tonight come on but you got to have joy with your salvation come on you got to enjoy being saved you know us thinking about even in a marriage when you lose that joy in the marriage when you lose that like the scripture says they left their first love when you lose that first love or when you looked in our eyes and something caught your attention way it didn't matter all you just want to do is be around that special someone come on because you enjoyed being around them hearing their voice hallelujah being in their presence but when you're in a relationship and you lose that come on i believe you in a dangerous grounds then you know i was listening to a testimony of somebody in their 90s they've been married uh well there was there was over 100 they've been married 80-something years come on and they asked them they said could you give the young people some some uh uh wisdom on how y'all stayed together so long well the one thing they said they said the reason why we stayed together so long we never went to bed uh upset with each other said no matter what we've been through through that day or what disagreements we had we never laid down without making those things right even if we couldn't find out who was right or wrong we just uh solved the solution and we woke up started the next day as it was new come on but they said that that's the best advice that they can give them what i say is that when when you lose that joy even in a natural marriage when you lose that come on i believe then you're on dangerous grounds because somebody then you lost to joy you go seek out that elsewhere come on but not only is that in the natural but it's even that in the spiritual realm when you lose that joy come on of coming to the house of god when you lose that joy of striving to be in his presence what you're going to do you're going to look for it elsewhere the church world as a whole lost it and that's why they brought in entertainment come on why because they lost the real presence of god and in all reality do they want it i don't know you say why because when the real presence of god come down what does it do it cleans up lives it straightens out homes it puts marriages back together it causes you to repent and say lord here i am creating me a clean heart when the real presents come down and they don't want it why because they're enjoying the pleasures of sin come on but i don't know about you but i preached a message one time about about the withdrawal effects come on and i says that you know once a person get addicted to drugs and things that withdraw for them they go through all kind of changes their body go through all kind of withdrawal effects and i said i don't know about you but when i ain't in the presence of god i start going through withdrawal effects when i can't feel his presence near i start going through withdrawal effects when i don't have my joy i start going through withdrawal effects and i start getting down on my knees searching lord where did i lose it at hallelujah you know some people if they don't if they don't uh satisfy those addictions they'll die come on they'll lose their mind they start hallucinating a friend of mine told me about snorting cocaine he says the thing is in the crack smoking crack he says it takes you to such a high he says you're here and it lifts you here and he says when you hear you all right when you hear you're all right he says but when you're coming down it's the in between he said that in between are coming down because you your body or your spirit got to such a place that that in between it makes you a a nervous wreck and he said you'll do anything to get back here come on and some of them they they wish they had never uh got to that place because now they hooked come on and i said that that's even here within our lives we're looking at natural death but it causes spiritual death come on that in between oh jesus but i said lord lift us up hallelujah bring us to that place to where god we're on that high all the time come on and even when we come down we don't go down but we come back up lord dip us again i said that's what we need uh i was i was uh praying the other day i was saying lord we need another sweep of the holy ghost we need a sweep of the power i said god the young people need to see it because god if you don't do something right now we're going to lose them all i'm afraid i don't know about you but i'm afraid for my home i'm afraid for my children that if god don't do something hallelujah he don't come to the rescue we'll lose him all do you believe that tonight sometimes we don't want to admit it but it's the truth anyhow we need god to come in i don't know about you but i was praying the other day i said raising children god i need you lord to help me i don't know how to raise them i don't know what to say come on i need your help i was i started singing that little song in my prayer help me help me lord because i'm pretty real i don't know about you but i need god's help you know and i says that come on i'll just just go on down i says you know uh david was praying for his joy he was saying lord i want my joy back ain't that what he was saying so i asked a question i said where have you lost your joy where is your love for god gone what took it away come on you know what i said the world can't give it and the world can't take it away or what took girls away come on i thought about i said a lot of times the the the of life when we left out on that don't you know we missed out on a lot of things we don't understand the power of prayer to the full magnitude i don't believe we do come on i said the other week i was i was preaching on troubled times i said what did the people do all through the scriptures during troubled times they prayed they found some way to get down on their knees and cry out to god in trouble times and god never failed to answer them when they cried in troubled times i said what what does prayer do how powerful prayer is you know prayer is so powerful jesus used it come on i believe that jesus could look into what was coming and he began to tell uh peter he said the devil desire to sift you as wheat come on i see what's up the road for you come on he said but nevertheless i would i prayed for you come on i said prayer must be powerful that jesus prayed for somebody come on that your faith wouldn't fail you i said what did you what's the secret that jesus knew about prayer that we don't know hallelujah i believe jesus knew that when he prayed demons trembled hallelujah it invited the angels of god come near oh jesus prayer is powerful you know me and my wife the other day was uh on the way to work and i mean on the way to the church and thinking about how they had that other mass shooting up there in michigan i think it was in the school and i was telling her i was saying that when i was young i remember when i first started school and how every morning over the intercom down there in mullins they would say a prayer somebody would get up there and have to be nothing deep something simple like lord help us today watch over the children watch over the teachers come on but i said that little bit was powerful we're we seeing now how much that little bit uh affected the school don't we i believe we're seeing the effects of how that little bit taken away did come on i said lord why would a man want to take that away come on take that away from the school system to ask god to watch over the children and watch over the teachers why come on had to be demons and devils to get prayer out of the schools right i said but even though i was taken out of the schools it didn't have to be taken out your home you can still pray in your home god help my children today god help all the children today help the teachers hallelujah my daughter uh mary last night was talking about dad we did an active shooter drill at school and i said it's a dark world we live in to wait now uh uh uh it's got to be uh added to the drills not a fire drill tornado but an active shooter drill because the world has got that dark the way it's the potential that any day somebody can come in here and shoot the schoolhouse up oh dark world we live in hallelujah do we need god's protection yes we need god protection we don't understand how much we need god's grace we don't understand how much that blood mean to us we don't understand how much that prayer means do you believe that come on i said the world has gotten that dark so i said that look they got to conduct active shooter drills because they know that we're living in a world full of maniacs we're living in a world that's gone completely insane they know that come on but they'll tell you everything is all right we got it under control come on i only know one that can right the ship i only know one that's got it all in control you can say what you want but i'm gonna put my life and the life of my family in his hands because i know hallelujah that he is king come on do you believe that tonight somehow to give god praise amen come on like i said i just know i skipped down i says you know i didn't want to be long what took the joy of your salvation come on say the people just ain't happy no more come on say i'm happy may come and spurts but people just ain't happy come on i look at my own life i say what took it away was it money come on david had to have to come to the reckoning of where he lost his joy at come on didn't he david first thing he began to do was repent come on because he realized that sin took his joy away come on when he used to when he saw the ark he was out there dancing why because he had the joy come on he wrote all these psalms why because he had the joy but it came a place in his life where the joy was taken away sin took the joy away didn't it i said did sin take your jaw away come on sometimes we got to reckon with ourselves lord where's my joy going the real joy not the imitation the real thing not entertainment the real presence the holy spirit as they say you're welcome and he would come down and rest on you the real joy lord i want something to shake my inner core i believe david said lord you know me how i was born in the iniquity and all these things god you know me help me deliver me from myself i said god i want to be delivered from myself nobody else is the reason you don't have your joy you are your worst enemy come on i pray tonight that we all find our joy back pray tonight that we all found that place the way we fall in love with god again we can get down on our knees and cry out like we ain't never cried out before why because we love him we don't mind staying all night we don't mind telling somebody about the goodness of jesus and all he done for us because if it was for him i'd be dead somewhere in my grave the other day i was telling my wife something happened to me the lord allowed me to go see some things and but when i was coming home he began to open my eyes to just how much he's blessed us you look at natural things but i ain't necessarily talking about that i'm talking about in life in general you think you got struggles and you think you're going through but sometimes god got to let you look at your brethren not saying my natural brothers i don't want that to go out like that but i believe that you know what happens a lot of times we got selfish motives and objectives we got selfish attitudes because we ain't out in the forefront so sometimes we think people forgot about us come on god ain't blessing us but nevertheless he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you when all forget you you graved in the palm of my hand i won't forget you that means more to me than anything the world has to offer that god will still remember me hallelujah oh jesus come on but he began to open my eyes to some things i thought about the scripture how uh uh god told the children of israel he said ye have i loved you saith the lord and they said lord he said you say when if you loved us and he said i want you to look at your brother and their inheritance and look at how i blessed you come on where i brought you from come on i chastise you because i love you he told them when they come into the land he says i want you to be aware that you don't do like those people did you don't search out to their gods he says because i uprooted them for those things and if you do those things i'll do you the same way didn't he say that come on so what it is we are blessed people we are covenant people we can't explain why god blesses us i'm just glad he did i don't know why he chose me but i'm glad he did and i'm going to be happy about it i'm going to shout about it i'm going to tell somebody about it hallelujah oh god hallelujah come on he said restore unto me come on the joy he wanted his joy back didn't he come on so one thing about it david could look back at where he was and i believe that you know nathan came to him once and began to tell him the little story about the man that had the lamb and the other ones that had all these other ones and but he was so greedy wasn't he he took that mother man's lamb and had him slaughtered it grieved david's heart to hear about somebody that could do something like that but he didn't know that he was the man come on and i said sometimes it grieves your heart darn it when you look at how judah sow jesus for 30 pieces of silver but look at your life sometimes are you the man judah sold them for 30 pieces what did you sell them for come on what did you give it up for come on what did you miss out for a moment not that it was over with and he realized what he lost out on what he do when he hung himself didn't he come on i said when you look at the story come on don't let don't let nathan say thou art the man come on come on glory to god i said what it is we find that you know but i like how he began to tell him you know that you know you were blessed of god god would have gave you whatever you wanted all you had to do was ask for it don't you know we had a place tonight we know he'll supply all our needs according to his riches in glory but i believe god loves you tonight come on that you are the blessed of god that he ain't gonna leave you without sometimes he don't give you stuff because he know it will destroy you you might not understand it but in the bible when the morning comes you'll know that what god did in your life he did it for you good a lot of things i wanted in life felt like i missed that on but when i look back see where god has brought me from see where he's placed me at now i said i didn't miss out on nothing i'm still in god's holy plan hallelujah oh jesus i'm still in the will of god and that's where i want to be i don't know about you but that's where i want to be at oh jesus is that where you want to be at tonight hallelujah he got all goals and all these things which are fine but god i want to be in your holy plan let my footsteps be ordered by you lord because this life it ain't it's just here here today and gone tomorrow come on every week you're hearing about somebody passing away ain't you come on the young and the old when god called your name come on will you be ready that's all that matters i guess it's been staying here lately we living this life so we can live again that's what i'm living it for come on is that what you live in it for tonight but we find that like you said david david reckoned with where he lost his joy at come on it was by sin had come in but not only did he recognize where he lost it come on but he began to repent didn't he and asked god one of the things he knew that was important was the heart david knew how important the heart was come on sometimes we forget that how important the heart is you can give god your strength like samson and all those but if your heart ain't in it come on you can give god your voice all these things but where's your heart come on i believe the bible just paraphrasing say the heart you know deceitful and wicked no man could know it come on it's a lot of stuff in your heart that you don't know is there but god knows there i always say you know god knows us better than we know ourselves he knows what we're capable of because he knows what's down in there come on so david saw the importance of the heart so he began to say lord creating me come on i don't want to repair the old give me something new god create creating me a clean heart come on do something in my spirit again and that's what we need even here tonight god to do something in your spirit just seeing it from the intellectual and the natural they ain't doing no good but what's up get in your spirit and begin to begin to working in that come on then things will begin to change then we'll begin to see the importance of it that we ain't wrestling against flesh and blood but we're fighting demon powers come on spiritual wickedness in high places ready to destroy your soul if it ain't for the grace of god we ain't fighting natural battles it's demons out there ready to destroy you ready to destroy your home ready to take your children demons devils we need the grace of god tonight come on i'll just cut off right there amen [Applause] praise the lord amen we thank god amen restoring me amen restore me o lord amen it's a time of restoration i believe that me and my wife was talking about revival amen they got up three o'clock the other morning and you know just started writing as the spirit of the lord i i said that's what we need amen and um i i i was listening to our brother ernest and caleb and i was up in louisville the other month and how um the pastor's son and different ones just said the youth had never experienced what we experienced in what we experience in a sense they need to experience the holy ghost like like we we experienced when we were coming up and we want that presence back praise god and i just say he's here praise god the same god is here right now praise god it's just that we got to enter into that presence amen god never left praise god is he he's the same god right now but we got to enter into that presence amen we got to know that that's what i want amen i i know what i need amen and god i want it amen i want the holy ghost god i want the power of god i need it god praise god hallelujah and i just believe it takes humility just being humble humble enough to acknowledge our transgressions since the lord and to me it just said the song says it's me it's me oh lord standing in the need of prayer god i need you i need a move of god in my life it's an individual affair it's not a group thing amen it's those that will call on the lord out of a pure heart to god i need you i need your spirit god i need the power of god i need the holy ghost and i want it praise god hallelujah things are happening when you when you cry from your heart and mean what you're saying and watch god move in your life as an individual we got to let go and let god have his way in our lives as individuals we can't sit back and ask god to move amen but you want god to move in somebody else that's going to inspire us to do something but we got to say god amen i'm not worried about the outside world it's me lord it's you and the lord it's individuals amen if you would cry to god with all your heart and say god i need you lord i need you let us just stand i need
