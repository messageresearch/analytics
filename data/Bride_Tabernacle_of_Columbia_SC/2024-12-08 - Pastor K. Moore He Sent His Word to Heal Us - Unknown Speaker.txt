this opportunity I just wanted to come and and visit see brother Simmons but U we'll stand amen and Proclaim what thus sayth the Lord amen is there any needs in the building this morning amen well I'm going to raise both of my hands seem like y'all are doing good but man I got some needs so I'm going to raise both my hands and pray that the Lord would meet my needs this morning let's just bow our heads together I greet the Saints back at home they should be in service right now now at this same time so the same God that we expect to move here I pray that he will move back at home with the Saints amen it's good to see you all one more time father Lord we're so grateful this morning yes Lord Lord for having an open door Lord Lord to come Lord into Fellowship to break the bread of life one with another father times like these will be fine Memories One Day Lord God so we should cherish each and every opportunity that we have to fellowship with our brothers and with our sisters those of like Precious Faith who have been called in a very dark hour Lord that we might be the light yes so have your way in this place anoint your word Lord and move this vessel of clay out out of the way and may you get the glory Lord for we did not come to see any man but we came to see you so have your way today we pray in Jesus name amen amen will you turn with me to the Book of Matthew chapter 8 God bless the [Music] musicians man organ I tell you I grew up in the church with a orgon and my Mama played the piano uh so it's something about an atmosphere that you can create uh in the house of the Lord with just the gifts that God has given amen and so appreciative for young menen right who could Market their gift like many are doing today um but yet they're serving here in the house of the Lord amen and we ought we ought to appreciate that Matthew 8 and we're going to go down and begin reading at verse five Matthew 8 we're going to read verses 5-10 and then we'll follow up with another scripture but let's just read this while we standing the Bible says and when Jesus had entered into capernium there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the paly grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him he didn't say he might he didn't say think about it he said I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel Lord we pray that you would add a blessing now into the reading of your word and the blessing that we desire Lord is that you will give us understanding for you said in all of our getting that we should get an understanding so have your way today we pray in Jesus name amen you can be seated my it's it's truly a blessing um there is something about Fellowship amen you know when I first came amongst the Believers um came in from the world though I had been raised up uh in the church but all we like sheep the Bible says have gone astray uh but I'm so grateful that he didn't leave me out there amen um he sent something after Meen and no matter sometimes how far you run how hard or how fast you run um he has a way of getting your attention amen amen you know I I know we've all seen a dog in the yard and you know on a chain and uh sometimes somebody walk past the fence and he'll run and run and sometime he forget that chain is around his neck am and when he runs and runs the next thing you know you get snatched right back in the place and I'm so grateful that uh he never disconnected from me um though I was in the world of sin um yet he kept his hands upon me and so there was something that he sent though after me and many times I believe it was the prayers of my grandmother the prayers of my mother and there's something about the word being sent something about the word being spoken um it has there is power in words what those of us who are parents um those of us who may be Educators or whatever it may be uh one thing that we recognize that the manipulation of words can have a lot of effect on people if you ever been a coach um seems like young men young boys sometime they listen to the more than they will they daddy sometime it's just something about that motivation and and the word has power yes sir Jesus made a statement he said my words they are spirit and they are life amen so this morning we speak life amen amen amen because we're speaking the word amen and you know I when I came and I heard uh the the music playing it just got me in the atmosphere I said let me just come out here um I've already talked to the Lord I've already read some scriptures I already prepared uh myself to speak though I didn't know particularly I was going to be speaking this morning but I I like being in the presence amen of the Saints I like being where the spirit of the Lord is for he promised us amen with a with a word he promised us that where two or three are gathered together in his name that he be in the midst amen so this morning and every time that I have an opportunity to go into the house of the Lord I go with an expectation amen for Lord whatever my situation is whatever my condition is you will send a word turn to Psalms 107 and no matter how many times I tell myself this and I try to rehearse this thought that I'm not get excited it is something about the word that stimulates amen for a Believer the word should really speak to you it should really move you amen not a word that we might get on the phone when somebody called not a word that we might get when we uh reading the text or searching the gram and all this stuff it not just that type of word I'm talking about a word word that has the power to change us amen amen amen I I don't like to come to church and uh I don't want to come in empty and then leave out empty I promise you if you pay your money to go to a restaurant your intention when you go in I might come in hungry but I don't expect to leave out hungry amen amen if that was the case we could ate at home save a few dollars many times I I much rather stay at home thank the Lord for having my wife with me for my wife is a good cooker I rather eat at home I already bought groceries one time I don't need to go out buy no more somebody can't even cook but you know when I come I I don't come if I come empty my prayer my heart's desire is fill me up Lord amen amen amen and I I I tell you brothers and sisters with all the things that life is throwing at us all e even the anticipation the nervous anticipation that people have even now as a result of Elections and things don't know what's coming down the road amen right and there's all kind of projections whether you watch the news or listen to it or read it all kind of projections oh the administration is going through this and oh the administr many people are apprehend many people are even boring on fearful don't know what's going to happen amen I work for the federal government for 31 years and things are getting ready to change drastically if the Lord carries but I am I am not fearful I'm not going to worry myself I got nephews and my daughter works for the government I'm not fearful oh lord they're going to lose their benefits God Will Make A Way and he said I I've never never seen the righteous forsaken noise he begging bread oh you may have may have been bordering on hungry before but real hunger brings pain so we might have wanted something to eat but I mean that real hunger Lord help us to hunger and thirst yes for more of him amen I promise you he will fill you amen Psalm 107 I might skip around a little bit because there's a very common theme when you read Psalm 107 um that as you read it it it might come become repetitive to you to an extent but the purpose of that is to drive the point home I don't care how good you are with a hammer usually you had to hit a nail more than once to get it to really see so sometime God repeats himself right that's a point of emphasis there is there is something that he's trying to say and he wants to get our attention so he'll repeat it amen how many times you tell your child to stop okay my point should be taken too many times you say stop once and that was it you had to reinforce that right so I'm going to go to verse one and here is where the heart of any uh believer should be it says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good amen we hear that cliche repeated it all the time God is good all the and all the time we hear that repeated but in our behavior in our conduct sometime it seems like we forget that we serve a good god am oh well why does he allow this why does he allow that many the things that happen to us we bring upon ourselves amen many times amen if we stay into the Ark of protection things will come but you'll have some Solace some peace of mind to know that many are the Affliction of the righteous amen but the Lord will deliver him out of them all am the word was sent to comfort us amen when Jesus died he said if I go not away then the comforter won't come amen so he went away and he sent his word that's what I want to talk about this morning he sent his word to heal us amen amen to heal you when you don't even think you need healing to heal you when you didn't even know you was wounded sometime we suppress those feelings amen amen sometime we hide our experiences and don't want anybody to know about it out of sh shame or whatever the case may be but he sent a word for you this morning to heal you amen Psalm 107 says let the redeemed of the Lord say so amen you know people say oh I'm just a sinner saved by grace no I was a sinner but I have been saved by grace I'm not going to keep labeling myself as a sinner amen amen this is a body of s but the real me ain't never sin bless him Lord let the redeemed of the Lord say so how many redeemed do we have in the building amen amen amen then if you redeem then say so stop acting like you're in the pawn shop left nobody don't care about you Jesus cares your pastor cares your family cares amen you're not in the pawn shop no more you've been redeemed amen we've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb amen let me read this it said whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy I'm grateful this morning because I know where I could have been I know that the phase of of life that I'm in right now the chapter of my life that I'm in right now could have been a whole lot different or had I not been redeemed how many know that the wages of sin is deatha man and I was like the song said I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the peaceful Shore right but it was his love that Lifted Me well how did I even find out anything about his love because somebody sent a word say young man Jesus loves you all your sin all your mess all the stuff that you did there was someone who still loved you go to verse 15 I'm going to I'm going to move on um there is a preaching anointing here this morning that means somebody came that wanted to hear the word that's all it that's all it mean that don't mean I'mma run up and down and if the Lord says so then hey we going to have a good time but nevertheless it's the word that will Quicken us amen amen the Centurion that we just read about he didn't even consider himself worthy that's right am to receive visitation from the Lord even though Jesus himself said I will come amen he didn't hesitate so where you live I ain't going over that part of town he didn't no he didn't hesitate he said I will come and heal him amen he will come this morning and heal you if you desire he be healed am amen you say I ain't sick well if you in sin you sick and you don't even recognize it amen greatest sickness plaguing the Earth today is sin sickness amen but there is bomb in Gilead yesen for the healing of the people my verse 15 says again oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness now there's several verses within this division of Psalm where that statement is repeated oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men for he hath broken the gate of brass and cut the bars of iron and thunder fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their soul abhor all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses it's it it's a shame to need help and don't ask for help amen amen there are people in this country Right This Land of Plenty this this land that had open arms to receive immigrants and things like that once upon a time um but people get upset when you see folks going to get help help is available all they doing is going to stand in the line produce whatever documentation the people ask for and they get help and folks get upset oh they get help we don't get help many times we don't get help cuz we don't ask for it BL Clos mouth don't get fed amen if you're hungry it's okay to ask amen amen if you're hungry God will feed us amen and he said then they CED unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them amen I think about often when I read this passage of the telling of Peter when he got out of the boat and walked on the water he said Lord is it you then if it's you bid me to come amen and and everybody think about the negative side oh he took his eyes off the Lord he went down when most people wouldn't even had nerve enough to step out the [Music] boat but they talk about oh he's su he took his eyes off the Lord that's when we go down that's when we begin to sing but you know the positive outlook that that I can present to you this morning about Peter when he be the sink he threw up his hand and said Save Me Lord we'll see ourselves going down and we refuse to ask for help no we getting weak no we getting weak but won't go to the your brother or your sister and say sis pray with me brother pray with me you I'm not saying oh you got to tell your business to everybody that's not what I'm saying a lot of time testimony service is people oh I thank the Lord my bill was do and I ain't know where the money was coming from bless God he paid it okay that's fine but how about the testimony to say brothers and sisters I want you to pray for me the enemy's been on my back and I need some help amen I ain't winning not one bit of detail amen if you want to go spread that around the town that's fine they said what brother said enemy was bwing good maybe somebody else might pray amen but if there is help available why wouldn't we ask for it amen the Centurion he knew he needed help and here's the thing that moved me about that it didn't say that he was asking the Lord to come and heal his son or his daughter he said my servant life at home sick of the pausy but if you would pray for him I ain't even worthy that you come under my roof but just speak the word here's here's where my thought came from here it say then they cry unto the Lord verse 19 in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses amen verse 20 says he sent his word amen and healed them that's right and delivered them from their destructions you know I can think of times when um I maybe was somewhere I didn't have any business being or doing something I didn't have any business doing um but there was a voice that I could hear the voice of my mother speaking the word said boy you need to get yourself together yes you need to be careful where you laying your head down at you need to watch them people you running with and I will hear it what was it it was the Lord using her words to stay in contact sometime we think we get out there so far that we're all alone but he'll send a word to come and get you amen think about the prodical son wasted everything that his father had earned and left for him but here's the reality that many time when you've been raised right amen you know something about the word of the Lord when you look at your own surroundings amen am you'll come to yourself so even the servants in My Father's House living better than this and here I am look at where he was man in a dreadful condition but the words came to him I'll go back how many need oh God how many need to go back from where Lord help me to remember roll back the curtain of memory now and then remind me where I used to be and where I could have been this this very morning amen went on a Sunday morning my mom told me you coming to church and I was grown by this time I said I I I'll be there mama and she sit up the front and she' break her neck till she saw me come in that door and I'd come down one aisle when they took up the offering put my offering in and I went out and went right on out to do whatever it was that I was going to do but I didn't lie to her I told her I was coming I came but I missed the most important part of the whole service it want the singing I en enjoyed the singing I love music my entire life it wasn't the singing wasn't what was important I left before the word came for and many of those Services he had a word that would have touched me that would have healed me amen amen but sometime the medicine is in the cabinet and folks won't take it listen I don't know why if you have high blood pressure and you wait till you start feeling bad to take your medicine is too late amen amen we are people that do that I don't take it till my head start hurting if you take it beforehand the head the headache might not come if we take heed to the word amen before we allow the enemy to get us out there so far amen it won't be so hard coming back amen amen when You' been raised up in the fear right amen and here's how the enemy try to trick people up well why should I Fear God it's not talking about the type of fear that you have for a wild dog no it's respect amen it's reverence amen children love their father sometime the father might have been the disciplinarian but they still loved them but when your mama say don't make me tell your daddy when you get home that was a Godly fear that was a good fear here make them have some respect my daughter's a teacher she said she told a little girl I'm going to tell your mama tell her no no respect no reverence there's no repercussion especially not when Mama drop you off smelling like weed the smoke po child smell like weed when it come in the classroom and we wonder God is sending a word am to heal us though sometimes we think the word is coming to destroy us sometime we think your parents are your enemies or somebody just want to stop you from having fun sometime you don't know what Avenue uh that that that open door will take you when you get free I know because when I got out there and I got access to go and come and do what I wanted to do right all the protections and the safeguards that my mama had put in place I blew right past all of them right with those open doors those opportunities see when I was a child in Pentecost right we we weren't allowed to play sports we weren't allowed to watch movies go to movies why because they they knew what was going to happen and some oh that's cruel that's hard Oh that's oh I'm here to tell you when I started playing football that was one of the worst things that happened though I enjoyed it though I was good at it though but where you going after the game oh so and so going to give me a ride home a't had no business with so and so well what time you think y'all going to be back well we got to wait we got to drop this one off and drop it might be kind of late Mom I'm making an excuse to go and do what I wanted to do because I had this new freedom and it was all wrapped up behind the game football oh yeah well he ain't doing nothing wrong he just playing football the game don't last all night sometime you blowing the team out they might have a running clock you get out of there early mama ain't looking for me too 11:00 man you know how much mess you can get in between 9 and 11:30 12:00 ain't too much good going on out there after 12:00 oh we having fun some folks just getting started at 12:00 I'm talking about high school 16 and you might have had a midnight curfew might have my mom said be in this house before midnight I was 167 had a little dirt mustache and I had to be in the house before 12:00 I used to get laughed at and oh but that football Set Me Free you play and ain't nothing wrong with the game of football it's a child's game but today you got multi-millionaires behind children's games they won't pay a school teacher amen won't pay a policeman M but one guy on the team have a $100 million contract other players right on the team with him can't get nowhere near that kind of money amen behind a game amen but people who love you and care about you willing to tell you the truth we let their word go in this ear and out of Amen when they sending the word to try to heal you amen sending the word to try to help us amen and so when we come into this this Sanctuary um just like many people when you got a condition you'll go to your doctor you'll keep your appointment um but it's fruitless to go to the doctor and not take heed to what they're telling you you know the Bible even reminds us it said that we should give the more Earnest heed that means we should pay more attention to the things that we have heard lest at any time we let those things slip he said well he preached the same thing a month ago two months ago yep and it needs to be repeated how many time your mama tell you don't go out there without a coat put that coat on she didn't just tell me that one time she tell me that all winter I'm in a hurry I'm rushing I'm Hot Blooded anyway I don't need no coat Mama I'm all right trying to be cute yeah you do need a coat all of these things were said and I'm and I'm saying it in a humorous way but all these things were said for our benefit this word is for our benefit God doesn't speak just to hear himself speak when that man asked for prayer he was serious amen so much so that he was concerned about even his servant am you know what extent a mother would go to for a child especially for that son them mothers and them Sons I'm going tell you they will go down behind them boys and the daddy will go to jail behind his daughter being Sav I don't want nobody to try me either somebody mess around with one of them girls I'll probably be in jail call the deacons to come get me out but it's but it's love that does that it's it's love that will constrain us to go the extra mile to look look we look beyond all their faults well not my baby yeah that's your baby but your baby just got sentence you gonna need some comary money but he didn't do that he was with them yeah he was there see we what we forget is birds of a feather have a tendency to flop together amen right but I didn't do nothing of it but my nephew told me Point Blank oh I was there I didn't pull P the trigger but I was there and you did 20 something years because you was there and a man died so we send the word to try to keep you from dying spiritually naturally amen there's a word God sent a word to heal us to see he already he already knows our condition amen amen he knows us far better than we know ourselves amen amen do you know when you go to a doctor he can't do nothing for you till you open up and you tell him what the problem is he can start testing you for various things but if I'm dealing with circulation in my leg and he start checking my head that ain't going to help me too much but what happen he said okay Mr Moore what is the problem and then I tell them what I'm experiencing amen and then he began to treat me and examine know which area God already know what areas that you struggling with this morning amen he already knows am and when he Brother s said something I talked to him a couple of weeks ago he said brother do do do ministers pray to see to get a word for the people not just something you think going to sound good no it it doesn't it doesn't matter how it sounds if it's what the Lord put together for you am he said if you being invited to a person's house to eat the Bible says eat what's set before you that's right amen my wife said that's why I ain't going with you overseas I can't I said no it's best it's best for you not to go it's best for her not to go if I already know she a picky eater why am I going to take her somewhere where people ain't got much but they going to serve you what they have amen and and they going to eat what you eat amen and if I take that invitation then I'm going to sit there and eat what they eat amen if not they're going to be offended amen and when we come to the house of the Lord it might not be seasoned the way you want it it might not be but if you were invited to come and you came you it would you need to eat what's set before you why because the Lord knows every ingredient that's in here amen he knows every ingredient that's in this word amen he knows exactly what I need amen amen oh that men would give praise yes to the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men amen yes you know being raised in the church is one thing um but it it it requires a little bit more than that see this is not a um this is not an an an a pass down thing right though traditionally we can pass it down say yeah my people went to church I went my people went to baptist church so I went to Baptist Church we can pass that down but this experience is something you got to get for yourself God don't have grand children and stepchildren and no he got Sons and Daughters same way your mom and dad had to get it you got to get it amen amen they praying for you they got a hedge around you am amen but you can step beyond that hedge sometimes yes and then when things befall us we'll do what the scripture said in their distress then they cried out Mama you ever seen them grown men on on some of these uh shows they didn't got in trouble well can I call my mom you want to call Mama now you ain't talk to her in 6 months but now you're in trouble you want to call Mom you know why cuz Mom will be right there to answer so God will always be right there amen it ain't no shortcoming in God brother and sister the shortcoming is in us the average man if I extend my hand to brother Simmons and wait for him to shake it I ain't going to wait for so long if he don't reciprocate if he don't meet me halfway then I'll say oh well but God is longsuffering patient since Calvary he been there with his arm wide open waiting patiently but men get tired oh man I'm through with them man I've been L how long Lord do I deal with this stiff necked rebellious people yes that's what the prophets of old times said how long Lord do I have to suffer these people that's right when it's Lord when it's the Lord imploring through the man to reach amen right yes because just just because a person stands up here does not mean that they're above you at all I preached in the maximum security prison for seven years um and they had a little platform pull pit like we I used to tell them put the put the thing down on the floor for me on on my Sunday when I come I want to be on the floor cuz I want to look them right in the eye because I came right out of the same situation that they came out of I I was no better than any of those men who were there some had life sentences um I was no better than any of them and I wanted to make sure they knew do that and because I could relate to them I there was a riot that's the only reason I'm not preaching there now they they killed four people I think it was in one day um and they kind of limited us from going there but I I firmly believe if I hadn't been there that day that Riot happened because those young men love me and I love them I believe I would have been protected and the next day I would have went in there because there was souls in there I was concerned about so many young sisters today um especially young black women single not a whole lot of eligible men out and when you stand and you look at a group of men that are come together on a Sunday and we we would sing We would pray preach the word and um I don't have any type of Tendencies at all but I'm saying here's a bunch of young healthy what some women might consider attractive men and they all locked up why because many times the word that was sent they didn't want to hear it but now in prison guess what happened the gifts flourish there was a there was a a a young man who had taught himself how to play the bass a young man played the organ um guys who could sing and I I there's not many people on the radio one guy in particular I'm thinking about that's all I had to tell him I said boy it ain't nobody on the radio that sound no better than you he would smile from ear to ear and then he was sing like an angel but he was locked up why because he failed to hear the word that was sent to heal him the day that you hear his voice right men young men especially we hard I I know I the stories I could tell about where I've been and what I've done so I'm not I'm not glorifying the enemy at all but the reality of it is we put on this mask right to blend all right and then now right because at an early age they are fed violence that's right that's right through TV Video Games music amen so it becomes the norm then we're not even going to talk about people being underprivileged and not having opportunities and not even having community centers for them to go you know let some of that energy out and they fall right into that vicious cycle that's right right but I was in that cycle don't stop praying for your children don't stop reaching out am don't shun them when they come and they ain't dressed right that's right no let them come if they willing to come let them come amen amen but show them some love my wife sang a song Last who will be Jesus to them amen who show the love that will restore them once again see Jesus said with loving kindness have I drawn them amen I'm this is a testimony real quick there was a young man um and as a matter of fact it's very it's very relevant right now there's a young man and his wife that I had met and they were doing Street Ministry and when I had started my church your pastor had blessed me with a sound system just something to get started with but it was perfect for what we had and he said Brother Moore all I want you to do is when you upgrade bless somebody else he said give it to somebody else and so when we got ready to upgrade that couple was the first couple that I thought about and so I gave him that sound system and they' go set up on the street corner and they put up a tent and the lady would cook two or three big pans of spaghetti and make garlic bread and have something to drink and just invite anybody to come and they would sing and preach and I thought about what brother Simmons had told me see you you passing it on to somebody else El they might not ever come set their foot in my church that's not what it's all about I didn't give them that to try to draw them to come with me no keep doing what you doing amen if God put you out there God will bless it am amen but we went to set up a cookout right dead in the heart of where the Crips conducted their business and because Russell was from the street and because I was from the street R said I'm going just go talk at I'm going to go holl at him and he went and talk and I saw him talking to the young man and uh he didn't look like he was upset but he just was accepting he nodding a little bit and then when he came back he said we good as long as you trying to do something positive for the community you good how long y'all going to be they shut down they shut down all their activity for that whole afternoon and they stood over at the corner store and they just watched us for a while right and about an hour and a half in here they come across the street and they get up and I tapped them up and showed him some love and talked to him and sat him down and ate a plate of food right that don't mean that they ran to my church or they ran to his church afterward no but they heard something that they might not have heard at home man we love you bro that's right I understand some of the stuff they doing don't don't scratch the tip of the iceberg what I did and the grace of God kept me from Jes still being out there amen all because it was a word that was sent and that word found its place and I began to hear and I began to take heed and then he sent me my wife who I did everything and she did nothing opposites ATT trct and she helped pull me right away from that life till I didn't want to be out there no more amen amen so when she didn't want to go out I said well let me go to plan B I didn't want Plan B amen I didn't want to call this one and call that one if I couldn't be with her I didn't I'm staying home amen and it was all because the Lord was still ministering my mom met my wife he said why don't you make her your girlriend I said that's my friend make her your girlfriend she knew more than I knew we've been together 40 [Applause] years all because you listen sometimes the Lord is speaking to you when you least expected that's right some of the ones you might think do you know the world will hold you to a higher standard sometime than you hold yourself I had a sinner correct me on the job he said all Mr so and so would broke down man I ride right past him I said I would too he said wait a minute preacher wait a minute hold it hold it you said it's okay for me to say that but you can't I said yeah you right I had to repent they will hold you to a higher standard because what you say people expect you to manifest it don't be telling me about Jesus Christ and you ain't trying to live like him am truth brother you trying to do everything that I do they buffing to you in the club oh no uhuh uh-uh you can't win them I don't want the recer when I done ran off the road and I'm stuck I don't want the record to back down there where I'm at I want him to stay up there on Solid Ground send a cable down or something pull me out don't come down here with me I'm already stuck we can't win them with the world we got to win them with the word and not not just a word spoken do you know why because the Bible says the letter kth uhhuh but the spirit gives life in other words somebody want to see you manifest has something live what you talking about and then you might persuade somebody amen King AG gripper said Paul you almost you almost persuaded me to be a Christian amen why his life yes here I'm going to close with this cuz I had more but I'm I'm going to close with this turn to St John chapter one and because we have read this scripture we have read it and read it and read it and for some reason um sometimes the emphasis doesn't land where it should St John chapter 1 see there Jesus had a Ministry an Earthly Ministry that only lasted three and a half years amen but look the effect of it is still going on today amen three and A2 years but the effects are still going on today am the the number one selling book of all time will always be the Bible amen you see every year oh New York's bestseller new I don't none of them talk the word amen in the beginning God said let there be light guess what it's still light you can't stop his [Applause] [Music] word but we sometime we underestimate the the power that's in the word amen than thank you sometime we underestimate it right singing it quoting it and everything but we underestimate it when we fail to apply it to our situation St John 1 right very familiar but I want you to look at it not different but in a in a different light okay in the beginning was the word amen right and what a word is you you ever been you ever had a thought in your mind and you said you heard people say I speak my mind well if the word is in your mind you ever spoke it a word is a thought that that you express when you speak it so in the beginning God said let there be light it was a thought initially but when he spoke it it became a word it became material it became real amen amen not just a thought okay so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen the same word amen how can a book how can a book be God it's the word we not going to get into the Greek and the logos and all that we're not getting in all that but the word right this same word is God in print amen it's the thoughts of God that were expressed okay now if you were a thought of God you are the word that's watch because your life has to fulfill the scripture think about this for a minute um everybody thinks about all the things that Jesus said right but what was more in more powerful was the things that he did watch the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made here is here is the theme that's written on the window on the post in the window in my church in him was life amen and his life was the light of men think about it it it didn't say just his word but it said in him was life and his life was the light of men so if you come around bringing the light and people in darkness light always conquers Darkness amen how come we ain't winning are we manifesting the light how come we ain't drawing more people out of Darkness are we manifesting the light amen now I'm not talking about your church doctrine or are we manifesting the light you said well how can I do that the light verse 5 says and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not but when you go go down in verse 14 right the Word was God but watch what happened to the word it wasn't just good enough to be first thought not just good enough just to be spoken but now guess what's got to happen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of Grace and Truth so did that just stop with Jesus no the word must be made flesh again in you am let your light so shine amen it's all about the life brothers and sister he sent his word to instruct us what his life is like amen he sent his word to heal us when we were in sin amen and he sent his word for us to manifest Christ am somebody ought to see Christ in you why because Christ in you brings them hope amen if they if they knew me from the street and what I did and now they see my life has changed they see Christ in me Christ in you will give them hope amen man I can change amen I ain't got to stay out here man amen amen amen there is hope what when I was in the world and I realized the thing had got to the point where you either had to be willing to kill or be killed you had to take that chance somebody somebody scheming on what you got some of your so-called friends want what you got and they get to that point hey where you going oh I'm going to North take that with you oh where you going I'm going to have you better take that with you we passed the gun around so you could be safe where you was going when it got to that point I said this ain't for me man I ain't trying to hurt nobody and I don't want nobody to hurt me but they hadin got that serious too much money involved too many people want to be respected and be tough most of them if they didn't have that gun they won't tough but you can stand way over here and do harm to somebody with a gun but if you get up close then you going to tell who's who man on man I take my chance well you pull that gun you going to do just like anybody else when I realized it was like that it won't no the voice of my mama start coming back boy you ain't got no business out there who is that don't let her see somebody come pick me up who is that tell him to come in he ain't coming in mom tell him to come in here where y all see that's what mothers used to do now well they let them have a private life ain't no private life long you living in my you living in my house you talking about a private life now when you grown and all that type of stuff that means your name is on the lease that mean you paying the light bill amen but when you here ain't one man here you can be off of age but if you choose to stay here it's my way or the highway oh that sound hard you going to run them away that's what the guy told me I was going to run my son away I said well if I run him away he running because he want to run not when I'm making everything comfortable for him three Hots and not even a cck three Hots in the bed I'm paying for every piece of clothes you got on your back every piece of food that go in your mouth and you want to disrespect me in my house not a man be taking me out with some bracelets but the reality is that's what we dealing with but we got to keep feeding them the word that's right and we got to keep showing them love amen make it so that they don't want to go out there everybody don't have to be like the particle son you don't have to go out there and then say Oh I should have went home I told my daughter stay here till you find till the Lord send you a husband that's right man you ain't got to go out there and deal with them jokers out there one one want to go out the back door and somebody else trying to come in the front you don't have to deal with that amen stay home your daddy will take care of you so that I don't wind up going to jail but this morning I'm I'm really grateful that you know that the Lord constantly put people in my path amen to speak the word right cuz words have power right and and when you hold on to some of the things that you heard even this morning it it might not ad meit a whole lot to you but put it in your pocket what maybe something you heard this morning put it in your pocket amen you ever put something in your pocket of value and went when you went back to that pants pocket oh Lord I didn't know that was in there you might not have needed it right now but later on something that you heard today you might need it amen amen the word is Perpetual right it's it's Eternal it it doesn't stop and at the very hour when you think not Jesus you might need that oh yes I can remember so many things my mama said my granddaddy said you said boy sometime a man got to do something even if it's wrong I didn't know what he meant I know what he mean now bless we got a family take care of you got to do something but I'm so grateful that I took the time to pay attention to what was told to me by people that I knew who love me amen the church these ministers those who labor among you believe it they love you because they're concerned about your soul and and that's that's the most important attribute for your leader any leader is that they have your best interest at heart I don't care if it's on your job wherever it is that they have your best interest at heart and if they don't then they'll just use you up but somebody who concerned about you want to see you thrive do good and avoid a lot of these pitfalls in life amen so God bless you this morning um I know he sent his word when I was in the system lock down thinking I was on my way to heaven but I W even doing what the word said and I asked the pastor about why why are we doing this and the Bible said don't do this why are we doing that and the Bible said don't do that and I got excuses and and then the Lord sent a word to me amen and that word healed me amen took me back to the Bible and I'm so grateful for that this morning because it turned my whole life around so this morning let's stand to our feet it's afternoon [Music] now I told you I wasn't going to run you up and down the aisles you didn't run um You probably get that maybe in another service but I've always been a type of person that I want to um speak in such a way that what I say might stay with somebody amen or make them think a little bit right because it takes God can't no man give you a revelation amen the best preacher that you know he can't give you a revelation only God can do that but if a man can say something to make you go back and look in that book for yourself right that's a good thing because the Bible says search the scriptures for yourself amen for in them you think that you have don't that sound kind of sketchy I well I think I got it I don't want to think I got it am I want to know and the only way I'll know I got to search that word for myself so God bless you uh can I sing a little chorus of a song brother you know [Music] Manu immanu his name is [Music] called he Manuel [Music] he's God With [Music] Us re in us his name is called he's here with us this morning IM man you [Music] Immanuel oh he man you well his name is called man you well he's God with oh re in his name is called amen [Applause] you can you bow your heads with us he's God with us we are in an age now when he's not just with us but once you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can say he's God in us see Once Upon a Time above us with us now he's in US amen when you've been born again it is the Life of Christ dwelling in you and he sent a word this morning to heal us it's a very simple formula thank you Lord just to repent Hallelujah and to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins and the Bible declares that we shall receive the Holy [Music] Ghost this morning whatever it is is that you need God is here to meet our needs can we pray together before I turn it back over to Pastor Simmons father God there are many thank you Jesus here today Lord God and I believe that there are some that heard your voice not just my voice Lord but the voice of the word that was speaking directly to our situation speaking to our condition Lord whether it's be parents whether it be children whether it be siblings Lord we know many times Lord how we've heard the warning but we didn't take heed Lord and then we paid the consequences the wages of sin it is death but the gift of God it is eternal life and I want you to know that if you ever will have it you already got it you just got to recognize it you got to claim it it wouldn't do you any good to have a winning ticket and you don't turn it in and claim it all the promises of God are yay and in him amen that means so be it it is for you this morning that if you you would not Harden your heart but if you would hear his voice and if you would repent from your sins he will save you it's not a fairy tale it's not something farfetched it's a word that will transform and change you and I am a witness for the transforming power that is in the word of God yes Lord father God now while heads and hearts are bow we pray that you would Minister Lord to those who are under the sound of my voice Lord Lord that if any desire prayer Lord the altar is open and it's not the place the

feed them that which they have need of Lord you can completely change our appetite no more for just the things of this world Lord but for the things of God for the things of God those things are Eternal minister to hearts and needes Lord long after I leave this place Lord but we're grateful that there are men of God here who stand for you Lord that will minister to them as you give the leading we thank you Lord for the opportunity just to share Lord a testimony Lord yes Lord I've often been accused of not being much of a Preacher I'm not really all about just being preachy Lord but
