lord as we look to you for all things in the name of jesus christ amen amen god is good amen want to look at exodus 14 by the grace of god thank the lord for being here tonight god is so good to us exodus 14 and we'll begin at the first verse we can go down to let's let's just start at the fifth verse by the grace of god you got it say amen and it reads and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled in the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned again was turned against the people and they said why why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us and he made ready his chariot and took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them you may be seated we'll read down a little further and a verse says and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out and with a high hand but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots and pharaoh and his horsemen and and his army and overtook them came camping by the sea beside pirates before base upon and when pharaoh drew now the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of israel cried unto the unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt thou has taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore thou has dealt thus with us to carry forth out of egypt it's not just a word that we did tell thee saying let us alone we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he shall show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ die unto me speak to the children of israel that they go forth lift up the rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea and i behold and i behold our heart in the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get my honor upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts upon his chariots and his horsemen and egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honor upon pharaoh and his chariots and upon his horsemen an angel of god which went before the camp of israel moved and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went before their face and and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the egyptians in the camp of israel and there was a cloud of darkness to them but it was it gave light by night to these so that one uh came not near the other all night and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord calls the sea to go back by strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided may god bless you reading of his word again well it's kind of lengthy reading but i just wanted to just read that part and tonight by the grace of god i just want to speak to you for a moment on on be still amen a little something how moses was here here and and you know how the people were frightened and they were afraid but you know i want to say that you know we've been blessed this week amen i want to say that because i'm still kind of in that framework i was telling my in-laws last night that you know it was such a blessing i would say that to me i i know i caused me to repent myself and go over my life and look at gave me a whole new outlook on on things amen and i pray that it did the same thing for you as well because that's what it is you know i believe god is about a god of change and wants you to change your ways the thing is the word when it come out sometimes we look at it for others but the word comes to you you know god sends the word to you so you can examine yourself and change your ways i thank god because god what he does he loves to critique us don't he and not not just just to be a super critic but he does those things because he wants to perfect us he wants you to be able to walk in in perfect uh peace he wants you to be at a walkman when he see he says you know be thou perfect as your father in heaven is also perfect well that we can't get in that perfection within ourselves but what it is our perfection will come uh by spirit coming in you but it'll be the word the word manifesting itself through you will bring about that perfection do you believe that tonight but you got to let the word work on you you got to let the word have its way in your life you can't shun this part in that part come on but no matter when the word comes you got to let you got to let the word have its way in your life you got to take that word and let it live in you how many feel like doing that tonight but i says that you know we we've been blessed and i thank the lord just for spirit and the power sometimes like say it ain't all in the deepness of things but it's in the simplicity of the gospel you know the prophet god talked about that about one's place he was saying about the holy ghost and how when you preach the gospel and simplicity that's when the holy ghost will fall when the gospel is preached until that is in that way and that's what jesus did when he walked the earth what he did he didn't come as many as would think is now to the scribes in the pharisees he might have said certain things to them but he preached it until such a simple way that the children could understand it and they can reach out and it gave them a hope to do something in their lives and i said god that's how the gospel should come the gospel comes hallelujah to correct don't it i thank god for that tonight don't you thank god for that tonight come on i pray that something i pray that i didn't want to say that tonight i pray that something changed you changed your your whole outlook on on your christian journey hallelujah but we find that i said here tonight about being still you know it's something about here israel at the red sea and and you know i read all that to just show how you know how in uproar they were and how you know it must have been a frightening place that they were in i'd say probably a place like the world is in today a frightening place a place where they're afraid afraid of what's going to happen tomorrow afraid of the sicknesses afraid of the earthquakes afraid of the wars you know stuff stirring up all over the world ain't it looked at the world leaders and everybody's is in a frightening state you know and that's what it is you know when you frightened and when fear comes upon you sometimes you'll say and do things that you don't really mean you say you don't really mean them but that's what was in your heart that what was in you the whole time and it came out through fear didn't it so we find that i says you know you know we see that these people uh of that day they were frightened and all those things and uh you know but the one thing first thing moses began to do after all the miracles they had seen after all the mighty works and how god had brought them out and yet they in this point of time when it looked like the whole world was coming down on them and looked like it might have been the end then fear began to grip them and all these things and i wanted to read something that you know i was looking up something on worriation because and i said it i found something in interesting it says you know variation is an exceedingly amount of worries that are now worsened because you are in a situation that is only getting worse that it originally was because you failed to let a grudge of some kind go and i thought about that i said how can somebody put those two together but they said a lot of times that's where a lot of your worriation and stuff come from it's something working down on the inside of you he says it started from a grudge of some kind that you failed to let go and that person began to talk about you got to go and make that thing go and get that thing right come on and that's what it is i was speaking with someone today you know they're going through heavy and i was saying you know our faith is in god and we know that god is the deliverer and i says but sometimes what we got to do within ourselves is is check ourselves up you know look we're deep within ourselves and make sure that everything is clear all your channels is clear make sure everything is right with god and if it ain't right make those things right then you gotta advocate with the father then you'll be able to stand out there on faith and watch god move amen so we find that i says that you know they were at that state of worriation you know frightened all these things but moses began to tell them you know like we said moses began to say to him stand still and that's what we want to talk about like we said tonight being still it's something about that stillness it's something about that quiet place like i was sharing with the church the other day i said sometimes you know we love the jumping and shouting but you get your major breakthroughs in those that quiet place i said sometimes when you find yourself in a lot of trouble or a lot of worriation a lot of things going on i said sometimes you got to get your key to the church and come out to the church sometimes you got to get in your prayer closet when ain't nobody else around sometimes you might can't get that so you got to get up two or three o'clock in the morning when it's real quiet i said sometimes you got to get in your car and ride down to the laker to the river come on uh why you say that because i've done it before and just go out there and get quiet somewhere and talk it over with god it ain't that you just going just to get away but you're going for a purpose because you want to talk it over with god you know i believe jacob had to do that didn't he he separated himself from all his family and all that because he was at a frightening place at his life all of his troubles was coming down on him wasn't he so he had to get to a place by himself i believe he had to get to that quiet place that place when he separated himself on the other side of the roof hallelujah then he began to wrestle with the angel but it says you got to get to that quiet place what is that quiet place is about standing still and letting god move standing still and letting god work in your life and you know i find that i says you know i was thinking about you know some things that that that um that uh you know i was faced with last month was kind of a rough month last month you know with the face infections i was having and had it twice and then right in the midst of all that got sick got covered they told me you had covered and all that and the doctor told me that this is what's most likely wrong with you but when i left out of the doctor's office the second time i got the infection i began to say to myself lord they don't know what's wrong with me they said we don't know why your body seemed like you ain't trying to fight it off i said god they don't know what's wrong i said but god we know that what it is is demons you know the devil is a tormentor and that's what he come to do to torment you come on but god come to give you peace don't he so no matter what name it's like the prophet god's saying about it being a germ no matter what name or what all they give it remember it ain't nothing but a demon it's a devil that come to torment you so when the doctors i said to myself when i got in the car they don't know what's wrong with me but i began to say lord it's all in your hands and god i'm trusting you this is where this is where god uh getting us that's where he got us and that's where you know i said lord i don't have they don't when they don't they don't know what god i say lord what else can i do i believe it scripture said it like this to whom shall we go where where else we gonna go lord hallelujah but the trust in you so i thought about that and i was home by myself and i thought about this the whole little sermon about being still come on quiet time with god home whole week by yourself time to do what talk it over think it over with god going through pain remember laying in the bed and all i could say was jesus i need your help god i need your help i like how moses began to tell him he said stand still and see the salvation of the lord he goes on to tell him god gonna fight for you come on i begin to say lord i need your help come on god i need you to fight for me how many need god to fight for on the night and that's what it's about come on you all in a word frightening worried about it come on what's gonna happen next what's gonna happen tomorrow god gonna fight for you sometimes he got to tell us stand still sometimes he got to let something happen to you to get you still get you to that place the way you can't you can't get up out of bed you can't go here you can't do that all you can do is lay there and call on the name of jesus you say how do you know it just happened to me hallelujah but i got there and i thank god because god settle you down and let you know i'm gonna take care of the infections i'm gonna take care of this come on be still i'ma fight for you these things that's tormenting you come on some people got stuff tormenting them tormenting them where they can't sleep at night tormenting them where they can't smile hallelujah but god want to fight for you he said be still hallelujah but we find that i says what it is i know as i said tonight we need god to fight for us don't we you know i was talking with i know you don't mind he's gonna be looking tonight brother copeland and you know just encouraging them things he's going through and i was sharing them with that i says you know we got to be still come home and see the salvation of the lord i said the doctors they don't know come on but god knows god gonna fight for you i said just just go over your life and make sure that come on because you got you got to be honest go over your life make sure you write with god and then let's stand together let's pray together hallelujah not talk let's pray together let's bind this devil up hallelujah and let god fight for us how many want to do that tonight but i i says you know what it is we find that i says about being still getting to that uh to that quiet place you know i thought about this little song and it says in a little song and i know many of you probably heard it i wrote down says this time i will be still and the mountain has to move said the mountain must obey the words that you speak and give away to your faith because it says that that you've got a job to do god give you a job to do and you got to see it through come on god showed you the way and you need to choose it today what's the way that god chose shows you come on god showed you the way he said i am the way hallelujah the truth and the life didn't he say that no man coming to the father but by me god showed you the way come on choose it today we choose everything else but the way that god has given us come on i said god when you're in pain when you're hurting hallelujah and nobody can't help you you got no other options hallelujah you'll choose god then you'll choose to let it go that thing like they said that grudge you'll choose to let it go in hallelujah because you need help hallelujah pharaoh's army's behind you see in front of you crying out for fear but be still god is going to fight for you hallelujah i'm so glad tonight that god fought for me and he's still fighting for me right now [Music] i say if god fighting for you come on i know i'm yelling but i said be still come on quietness because something rang out in your soul you know when god when god does something when that real peace comes you might still be in the midst of the storm but you know it's over with you might still be in the midst of your trial what you faced with but when that real peace comes you don't even worry about it i believe just like joel said though he slayed me yet i'll trust him what it is real peace down came and that's what we want we want real peace you know one thing i like i didn't want to be long tonight but one thing i liked and hearing the scriptures while you know they were going through i like how it says that the cloud that led them by day you know and it was a fire at night it said it came in between them and pharaoh's army i like that i begin to just meditating on it says that that it came in between them and it was a darkness to the enemy but it was a light a fire light to them but it came in between them that they couldn't come near each other all night i began to be stirred in my spirit i said because you know what don't the devil attack you at night there'll be some long nights right frightening nights because you know the enemy is out there but how much of a blessing it is to know that god is between you and the enemy the blood is there and he can't cross the bloodline all night long hallelujah that god won't let the devil come near you he might bluff he might do all those things hallelujah but remember and i says that even in in that and all the night when the fire was between them and the enemy and the pharaoh's army couldn't come near him don't you know god was working something out the wind was blowing making a way for him wasn't it in the midst of the night the wind was blowing i could see them you know maybe in that morning time when they looked up hallelujah that might have been a long night might have been one of the longest nights of their life but when the morning came and they saw hallelujah the dry land before them just dramatizing maybe hallelujah and they can walk over they might have didn't know what was taking place in the night but when the morning came then they could see the significance in it that while we were going through our frightening part a horrible terrible part god was still working hallelujah i like let's say even when i don't see him he's still working even when i don't feel him he's still working in the midst of the night god is still working when the morning come you'll see then hallelujah how many believe that tonight come on but i said be still don't you know god god wants to show us god wants to show us a lot of things don't he what what is all those trials and all those things about god want to show you he want to fight for you come on god don't you know don't you know that god want to take care of you and we would learn that long time ago hallelujah then we wouldn't had to go through some of the things that we went through because we to realize hallelujah that god he had he knows what was best for your interests he knowed he knows how to take care of you god knows if we would have learned that long time ago that god it's all in his hands we wouldn't had to go through those sleepless nights we wouldn't have been kicking against a prick we would have let go long time ago and gave it over to god and let god deal with it and we don't know what we know now hallelujah but god takes us through those things hallelujah that the next time around i don't care how hard the situation is how bad it gets hallelujah you know who fighting for you you know hallelujah god brought you to this but he says that the enemy that afflicts you you ain't gonna see him no more again forever god was gonna annihilate him i thank god for that hallelujah don't you know when real deliverance comes it don't come back come on when real deliverance come god take care of that thing you don't have to deal with it no more because real deliverances came the reason why people battle over and over with the same things because they never got real deliverance they got partial deliverance but i said god i want real deliverance i want to stay on the altar long enough till i die lord till it's over with i don't want to walk round thinking it might come back deliver me lord hallelujah many are they that rise up against me many are there to save my soul there is no help from him in god but thou o lord are sealed for me my glory and the lifter of my head oh jesus you know the day i was just meditating on the lord i said lord you my glory that's all i was saying lord you my glory god you're my glory is there any glory god it all belongs to you lord you're my glory then i started saying lord you're my deliverer lord you my healer you know the devil don't like when you start giving god the glory like that because the presence of god comes down i said lord you're my savior lord i love you hallelujah no matter what i'm faced with no matter what i'm dealing with god i love you god you're good anyhow oh jesus hallelujah oh glory in that quiet place you can make love to god hallelujah in that quiet place you can tell god all about it hallelujah oh jesus don't you want to tell god all about it i don't know about you but i've been telling them all about it but i've been saying lord you know i ain't been complaining and whining i just been saying lord thank you lord you good lord your mercy endure forever lord you're my healer lord you're my deliverer you're my savior i'm not even worthy of the least of your mercies but thank you for giving it to me thank you for saving me come on you feel good when you start praising god don't you know you feel good when you start thanking god his presence come down that's what it's all about i don't know about you but i want his presence hallelujah i said the revival ain't over with his presence is still here but you got to bathe in that presence you got to stir it up hallelujah within you you got to stir it up come on let the holy ghost fall that's what it is you know i said i had to repent i started telling everybody i love them told my siblings every day this week i text them and tell them i love them i love y'all telling everybody i love them hallelujah why when god do something for you god really do something for you don't it oh jesus come on i said what it is i was sharing like i'm sharing with my in-laws i call them we all family sharing with them last night i said people got walls built up walls oh hallelujah i said anointing will be there the power of god holy ghost will be fallen but they got walls and he can't get in the walls don't know that the fruit of god is there don't know the blessings of god is there don't know their healing is there their deliverance is there but they got walls i said they come on let's let go of the walls whatever it is let it go let god come in and free you hallelujah deliver you oh you'll shout the victory then oh jesus hallelujah saying that i said that's what it is come on oh when god is in the building you can get anything you want whatever you have need of when god is in the building oh jesus come on i believe god is in the building tonight he said where two or three are gathered in my name i'm there in the midst when god is in the building don't let the walls be up when god is in the building come from behind that wall hallelujah you'll never be the same oh jesus do you believe that tonight oh glory to god you know i'm stirred i i'm i said god you know i've been born again i've been refilled hallelujah come on say what did you shout all over the place did you speak in tongues come on i like doing all that too come on but when something inside your soul gets set free something inside there works something inside there get unrooted hallelujah people don't even know what you're talking about they don't even know where you're being that hallelujah they don't even know what she was battling but god knew what she was battling and he sent a word to heal you he's sent a word of deliverance to reach down in there you got to let god work i said let him work tonight amen [Applause] praise god be still and know that i am god praise god i will be exalted amen thank god i i wrote down on message i mean wrote down the subject let go amen god said let let my people go amen let go and let god sometimes we're holding
