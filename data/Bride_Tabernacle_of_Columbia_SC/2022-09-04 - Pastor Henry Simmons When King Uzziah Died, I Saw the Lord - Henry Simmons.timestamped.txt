[35:34] isaiah 6
[35:37] 1-8 i read the first you read the next
[35:40] one we read they first together
[35:44] in the year the king uzziah
[35:48] died i saw
[35:49] [Music]
[35:50] also the lord
[35:53] setting upon a throne
[35:56] high and lifted up
[35:58] and his train filled the temple too
[36:14] and one cried unto another and said
[36:18] holy holy
[36:20] holy is the lord of hosts
[36:24] the whole earth is full of his glory for
[36:35] then said i woe it's me
[36:39] for i am undone because i am a man of
[36:42] unclean lips and i dwelled in the midst
[36:45] of a people
[36:46] of unclean lips
[36:49] for my eyes have seen the king
[36:52] the lord of host 6.
[37:04] and he's and he laid it upon my mouth
[37:08] and said lo
[37:11] this has touched our lips
[37:15] and
[37:16] thy knickers is taken away
[37:19] and the sins perished together
[37:23] also i heard a voice of the lord saying
[37:27] whom shall i sin
[37:29] and who will go for us
[37:32] then said i
[37:33] hear am i
[37:35] send me
[37:36] amen god bless you read this word you
[37:38] may be seated
[37:41] isaiah
[37:44] was facing a period of time in life
[37:48] amen with his eyes as the prophet of god
[37:51] says his eyes
[37:52] was
[37:53] fashioned on king god's eye
[37:56] and ozzie was
[37:58] the thing that he was seeing
[38:01] because as i was a good king and other
[38:05] perhaps of somebody that the young
[38:08] isaiah the prophet could look up to
[38:11] and sometimes we have
[38:14] people in our lives that we look up to
[38:17] and um and sometimes the person that's
[38:19] in our lives are the thing that's in our
[38:22] lives and we want to talk to you
[38:24] uh this morning about
[38:27] when king anzai died
[38:30] i saw the lord
[38:32] when king
[38:34] as i uh uzziah died i saw the lord
[38:38] when king uzziah died i saw the lord
[38:42] now
[38:44] like i said as the prophet brought out
[38:47] there
[38:48] sometimes we're looking at
[38:51] the
[38:52] somebody that's got great influence
[38:55] in our lives and we're looking at them
[38:58] and i'm i i i'm to say you know
[39:01] sometimes i've looked at people that
[39:04] you want to try to be like this or be
[39:07] like this one or be like that one and
[39:09] sometimes we think that that's what
[39:11] they're successful
[39:13] especially looking at somebody that
[39:16] looked like god was with him and god was
[39:18] blessing him and the man looked like he
[39:21] had a fear of god
[39:23] and um so it was a good person
[39:27] no matter how good the person is
[39:30] sometimes
[39:32] things
[39:34] can blind you
[39:36] from seeing the lord
[39:39] sometimes we can put our confidence and
[39:42] our trust
[39:43] in what appears to be
[39:46] good
[39:49] sometimes it could be
[39:52] your father your mother your sister
[39:54] sometimes it can be the pastor it can be
[39:56] the prophet or whatever
[39:59] whatever your king is
[40:01] now
[40:02] realizing that he didn't have his
[40:04] confidence and his faith
[40:06] and anybody this person was a king
[40:10] and the bible tells us he was a good
[40:12] king
[40:15] but
[40:17] sometimes even with all our good
[40:20] sometimes we can allow a little bad to
[40:22] come in
[40:24] are you with me
[40:25] i'm going to um focus a little bit on
[40:28] the second chronicles 26.
[40:31] things happen in king azad alive and no
[40:34] doubt
[40:36] isaiah was a witness
[40:39] to
[40:40] things turning in the
[40:42] king ozzie
[40:44] life
[40:45] desire life
[40:47] and caleb being up front i wanted to
[40:49] read something but that's all right josh
[40:52] your mind getting it
[40:56] second chronicles 26.
[41:05] okay
[41:09] 26 16.
[41:15] go right here josh
[41:16] oh
[41:19] but when he was strong his heart was
[41:21] lifted up to his destruction
[41:23] for the transgress against the lord his
[41:25] god
[41:28] went into the temple of the lord to burn
[41:30] incense upon the altar now
[41:32] the bible says here
[41:34] but when he was strong
[41:38] you know sometimes
[41:40] not when we're weak that we do things
[41:42] but when he was strong his heart was
[41:44] what
[41:46] his heart was lifted up
[41:49] are y'all with me
[41:54] you know sometimes we could be strong in
[41:56] the lord and god can use us in great
[42:00] ways but
[42:02] in his strength
[42:05] his heart got lifted up
[42:07] amen brother and sister and you know
[42:10] that's what god you know
[42:12] we have to be careful and watchful
[42:17] we can go on with the lord and god can
[42:19] use us in mighty in great ways
[42:21] but it's easy to get lifted up and think
[42:25] amen that we can do what we're not
[42:27] supposed to do
[42:30] we can uh do what
[42:32] we're not supposed to do
[42:37] brother and sister we always
[42:39] gotta
[42:40] stay humble
[42:44] humble before god
[42:46] for the minute we think that we
[42:52] are so blessed
[42:54] that we can do what we want
[42:56] amen and nobody can say or do nothing
[42:59] about it
[43:01] because i am strong
[43:04] in the lord
[43:06] the bible said when he was strong
[43:09] his heart got lifted up not when he was
[43:12] weak
[43:13] you see that many times when we're weak
[43:15] we depend on god amen
[43:19] we stay humble and we trust the word
[43:22] you should have left it down
[43:24] that's all right
[43:27] but anyway
[43:28] well when we strong it's hard to tell
[43:31] somebody
[43:33] you know things when they're strong it's
[43:35] hard to get it over to somebody when
[43:38] they're strong
[43:41] because you can't tell a strong person
[43:44] no amen
[43:46] amen you see what i'm saying right
[43:48] sometimes spiritually we get strong in
[43:51] the lord
[43:53] and in the power of his might
[43:56] you know
[43:58] and sometimes the thing just twisted a
[44:00] little bit just don't take but a little
[44:03] bit of self to get in it
[44:05] just a little bit of you getting it
[44:09] just a little bit of flesh
[44:11] the devil just twists you just just a
[44:13] teeny bit
[44:18] and there's no more god
[44:21] are you with me
[44:23] now this is what happened to
[44:25] uzziah
[44:27] um she said
[44:30] and when he was strong his heart got
[44:32] lifted up to
[44:34] to his destruction
[44:36] [Music]
[44:38] go ahead read
[44:42] boy he transgressed against the lord his
[44:44] god and went into the temple of the lord
[44:47] to burn incense upon the altar of
[44:50] incense okay what's wrong with that
[44:53] what's wrong with him doing something
[44:55] that
[44:56] is good
[44:59] to offer incense before the lord
[45:01] go ahead
[45:03] and azariah the priest went in after him
[45:06] and with him four score priests of the
[45:08] lord that were valiant men you know this
[45:11] man was a king so as a riot get me some
[45:14] help
[45:15] this is the king
[45:17] and me going against the king i'm just
[45:20] i'm just a priest
[45:22] but this man is a king
[45:26] and the king he's supposed to know
[45:28] better
[45:30] you know sometimes
[45:32] we
[45:33] take for granted that the king would
[45:35] know better we take for granted that the
[45:38] spiritual and strong and the person that
[45:40] god used modernly and powerful ought to
[45:43] know better
[45:47] sometimes we think the pastor ought to
[45:49] know better sometimes we think amen uh
[45:51] uh mama ought to know better daddy ought
[45:54] to know better we might think that the
[45:56] one that's more spiritual than
[45:58] i ought to know better
[46:02] ought to understand what they're doing
[46:06] but it don't take but a little deception
[46:11] for our heart to get lifted up amen
[46:15] just a little twist
[46:19] but because we know that we are strong
[46:22] and we know that the lord is with us and
[46:26] we know that how blessed we are and how
[46:30] god has moved in our life and how god
[46:33] has demonstrated his glory and how the
[46:36] power of god is with us
[46:39] okay okay okay
[46:42] god is with me and god is working in my
[46:45] life and god oh
[46:48] god is favoring me
[46:50] this king had done exploits
[46:53] he wasn't just anybody he was blessed of
[46:55] the lord
[46:57] go ahead
[46:59] and they withstood uzziah the king
[47:02] so it's
[47:03] it takes tolls that even though the king
[47:06] was strong and god had blessed him
[47:09] and no doubt
[47:12] where israel was
[47:14] and how blessed israel was the king had
[47:17] a lot to do with that
[47:20] because his zeal for god
[47:23] and how he stood for god he had a lot to
[47:27] do with their blessing
[47:29] but yet amen they saw the king
[47:32] hard you know you got to be careful you
[47:35] got to you got to watch the word and you
[47:37] got to stay with the word regardless of
[47:39] who it is
[47:41] amen because regardless of their
[47:43] position or their title or who oh god
[47:47] you got to stick with the word
[47:49] it doesn't make a difference who it is
[47:54] i'm glad for
[47:58] as a writer
[47:59] go ahead
[48:01] he said
[48:04] you got a lot he got a lot of help
[48:06] sometimes when somebody get off
[48:08] it's hard to find help
[48:11] the help
[48:12] the person that's got off
[48:15] somebody get off and use
[48:16] they off the word after work can you
[48:18] come help me oh no you take care oh no i
[48:21] i ain't messing with that
[48:23] you ever seen somebody off and you
[48:25] wanted some help and and i ain't getting
[48:28] involved with that
[48:31] that that between them and law
[48:35] why it may be
[48:37] it may be your king
[48:40] it may be the one that you
[48:42] you you know you're looking at the one
[48:44] that's you know
[48:46] you know
[48:47] that's causing you
[48:50] to be blind
[48:51] amen
[48:52] and not when you you're not gonna touch
[48:54] because they
[48:56] he was strong in the lord
[48:59] so you say well i i don't touch them
[49:01] because
[49:02] you know the bible said touch not my
[49:04] anointing and do my prophet no harm
[49:07] are you with me
[49:09] so you say well i'ma leave that alone
[49:11] but i i believe that somebody was there
[49:14] to see amen he's doing something that
[49:16] he's not supposed to do and i and we're
[49:19] going to go to him and tell him don't
[49:21] you do that
[49:24] go ahead don't read
[49:26] in an opportunity not unto thee isaiah
[49:30] to burn incense unto the lord but to the
[49:33] priests the son of aaron that are
[49:36] consecrated to burn incense see certain
[49:38] things belong to the ministry
[49:42] you don't go and share things
[49:46] that i pertain to the ministry
[49:51] are you with me
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] see he gave some apostles some prophets
[49:57] some evangelists some pastors and some
[50:00] teachers
[50:01] and these things were for the perfecting
[50:03] of the saints
[50:04] for the edified in the body of christ
[50:07] are you with me
[50:09] so we have to stay in our position we
[50:12] just can't say because uh who i am
[50:15] because i'm strong in the law and god is
[50:18] working mightily with me then i can take
[50:21] on my own headship
[50:24] are you with me
[50:27] the bible said his he got lifted up
[50:32] and i'm gonna do my own thing
[50:35] it doesn't matter what the words say i'm
[50:37] gonna do what i
[50:40] because i am who i am i am strong in the
[50:44] lord so i'm gonna do what i say oh
[50:48] oh
[50:49] wait a minute what what happened
[50:57] go out of the sanctuary for thou has
[51:00] trespassed neither shall it be and not
[51:02] honor for the lord god
[51:05] okay
[51:07] what you're doing
[51:08] it will not honor the lord you're not
[51:11] supposed to do it
[51:12] it will not honor the lord
[51:16] are you with me
[51:17] see what we do
[51:19] is it for god's honor and what is it
[51:22] according to the word or will it honor
[51:24] the lord not because i can do it i'm
[51:28] saying will it honor the lord
[51:30] amen amen amen are you look man
[51:34] it wasn't the you know it it looked like
[51:37] it was all right they offer incense to
[51:38] the lord it's all right to do this until
[51:41] the lord it's all right because amen
[51:43] that's what we're supposed to offer and
[51:45] sent to the lord but it's not your
[51:47] position to do
[51:49] amen
[51:51] it's the priest's position to do that
[51:53] amen
[51:55] okay
[51:56] you are out of your position amen
[52:00] are you with me
[52:02] okay
[52:03] go ahead
[52:05] then uzziah was robbed and had a
[52:07] sentence
[52:08] can you see people
[52:13] who oh i'm king
[52:16] i'm strong and low
[52:17] you're telling me me
[52:21] your king
[52:24] what to do
[52:28] can you see
[52:29] this king will god doesn't use him
[52:31] mightily
[52:32] powerful king
[52:34] there was a right in the side of the
[52:35] lord
[52:36] powerful king
[52:38] but he
[52:39] getting off and somebody going to
[52:41] challenge you off the wire king
[52:46] ain't too many people when they get off
[52:48] the word once they've been used
[52:50] moderately and powerfully they can
[52:53] humble themselves down
[52:55] amen
[52:56] to listen to anybody because i am the
[52:59] pastor
[53:02] are you with me
[53:05] i am the pastor
[53:07] i'm the bishop i'm just
[53:11] can you humble yourself
[53:13] can you get off your high horse and
[53:15] humble yourself when you're wrong
[53:19] when you're off the word will you be
[53:21] humble enough to admit i am wrong
[53:27] i told him not in mullins the other
[53:28] night i said many times
[53:30] i made mistakes
[53:33] then i was asking the minister
[53:35] you ever made a mistake
[53:38] how about you
[53:39] i said we can't admit we make mistakes
[53:42] it's something wrong
[53:44] if the preacher in the pulpit
[53:47] every time he get up if he always saying
[53:50] a hundred percent you can trust and he
[53:53] don't get off sometimes something wrong
[53:55] but i have to come back and say y'all
[53:58] forgive me
[54:00] i got off a little bit
[54:02] maybe and not so much what you say how
[54:04] you say it
[54:07] are you
[54:09] and then you got to say well i
[54:12] you know some sometimes somebody has to
[54:14] remind you come to you and say pastor
[54:16] hey
[54:18] say oh y'all forgive me amen
[54:21] that's one thing i used to always say to
[54:24] the sanctioned mullen i would always
[54:27] appreciate brother
[54:29] flagen i know he had my back all the
[54:31] time
[54:32] and sometimes i you know sometimes
[54:35] pressure can get on you pretty heavy in
[54:37] the pulpit and sometimes you can come in
[54:39] to put bit and you can go all foo foo
[54:43] and i sometimes i would come especially
[54:45] as a young fellow
[54:48] he'd come to me
[54:59] right now
[55:00] you need a break you need a break you
[55:02] need to go take a risk
[55:09] y'all forgive me and then he said take
[55:12] up take a break take a break you need a
[55:13] rest
[55:15] sometimes it all in needing to rest
[55:17] sometimes
[55:18] and because he loved me and cared about
[55:20] he didn't want
[55:22] me
[55:22] he meant to look like that in front of
[55:25] the people
[55:26] see what i'm saying somebody got your
[55:27] back and you know i and i asked him i
[55:30] said brother did when you corrected me
[55:33] that ever i say
[55:35] you're wrong don't help no i said thank
[55:37] you
[55:39] it was always thank you i appreciate
[55:41] that
[55:42] you see what i'm saying i said through
[55:44] the years i said
[55:46] you know and that's what you want you
[55:48] want somebody to say something and
[55:52] and you'll be humble enough to say thank
[55:54] you for giving
[55:56] and telling people forgive me
[55:59] you know what i'm saying
[56:01] so by the grace of god when we cannot do
[56:03] that no more amen then it causes us to
[56:06] get a little bit lifted a little bit
[56:08] more higher
[56:09] but we got to be always willing
[56:12] to be corrected
[56:14] amen because sometimes when other folks
[56:16] see you you can't see yourself
[56:20] and sometimes you can inflict amen pain
[56:24] that you don't know nothing about
[56:26] somebody was telling me that the day
[56:29] sometimes we can set things we didn't
[56:31] even know we heard somebody feel it and
[56:33] they they hurt and hurt and bad and you
[56:36] would never do it until they told you
[56:40] but sometimes it took
[56:42] years before they told you
[56:45] but when they told you oh lord didn't
[56:48] even know it
[56:50] you know what i'm saying
[56:51] so brother and sister and you might tell
[56:54] me oh
[56:55] oh you're the only one do that i'ma tell
[56:57] you something
[56:58] the only way you never done it i don't
[57:01] do it you the same as a perfect man
[57:06] are you offended not in the word
[57:10] are you with me that means you can't
[57:12] talk
[57:16] because sure enough
[57:18] some kind of way you might talk just a
[57:20] little bit
[57:21] but some kind of way the devil
[57:23] might twist what you're saying
[57:27] are you with me
[57:29] and i found some mighty sweet people
[57:32] that i said they just is loving and kind
[57:35] i can't find a phone in them but i
[57:37] guarantee you they still make mistakes
[57:43] okay go right here
[57:46] and had a sensor in his hand to burn
[57:49] incense see first of all he got mad
[57:52] and when you get mad at somebody
[57:56] that's the wrong spirit anyway
[57:59] he got wrong he got mad
[58:01] somebody come to you to try to help you
[58:03] stay with the word and you get mad at
[58:05] him
[58:07] let me tell you the first thing when
[58:08] somebody tried to correct and you know
[58:11] one brother was telling me something he
[58:12] was 100 right
[58:15] on what he was telling me
[58:18] and i believe he was right
[58:21] but you know what he started doing
[58:23] he pulled out all the faults
[58:25] in the people in the church
[58:28] and when he did that i said huh that's
[58:30] the wrong spirit amen i ain't gonna
[58:33] handle the situation for him because one
[58:37] what he did was
[58:39] he pointed out the fault of everybody in
[58:41] the church that was off that he knew
[58:46] see what i'm saying
[58:47] and i said now
[58:51] once you've done wrong deal with your
[58:54] wrong and you deal with that alone
[58:58] are you with me
[59:00] he was saying what that one wrong
[59:02] doesn't wrong that one and so and they
[59:05] were worse than me
[59:07] now you come for repentance
[59:10] and you come to get right and you're
[59:12] telling me about all these other folk in
[59:14] the church
[59:15] i was you know handling the case for him
[59:18] and a situation for him and
[59:21] i said
[59:22] that brother ain't ready
[59:24] you want to come back to church when he
[59:25] ready to come back to church
[59:28] because you don't begin to justify if
[59:31] you're wrong and you got the right
[59:33] spirit of repentance just go ahead on
[59:36] and say lord it's me it's me oh lord
[59:39] standing in the lead of breath not
[59:41] nobody but me
[59:44] that's all i want to deal with
[59:49] because
[59:51] don't measure yourself by yourself
[59:53] by other folks
[59:55] just deal with you let god deal with
[59:58] with them on their own thing
[1:00:00] and
[1:00:01] god deal with you
[1:00:03] but here
[1:00:04] he got
[1:00:05] he got angry
[1:00:09] i i guess he said
[1:00:11] well the way god used me you might have
[1:00:14] used me more powerful than you priests
[1:00:19] look what look what god had done in
[1:00:21] under my administration is king amen if
[1:00:25] if if i wasn't king y'all wouldn't have
[1:00:27] been where y'all are
[1:00:30] look what kind of condition y'all was in
[1:00:32] when i became king and look what i had
[1:00:35] to do amen
[1:00:38] to get the kingdom back on track
[1:00:42] and y'all come up here telling me
[1:00:44] what i can't do
[1:00:46] watch me
[1:00:48] watch me
[1:00:51] show y'all
[1:00:53] you see what i'm saying you see what we
[1:00:56] because
[1:00:58] he was strong
[1:01:00] in the lord because god had used him so
[1:01:03] favorably
[1:01:05] he said
[1:01:06] and you say i was wrought
[1:01:10] with the incense and while
[1:01:12] he was what
[1:01:14] while he was wrought with the priest
[1:01:17] what happened
[1:01:20] left to say what
[1:01:23] in his forehead that's a good place
[1:01:26] for it to rise up where everybody can
[1:01:29] see it
[1:01:30] left as it rolls up in his
[1:01:34] forehead
[1:01:36] are you with me

[1:02:09] priests looked upon him and behold he

[1:02:14] he was leprous in his forehead and they
[1:02:17] thrust him out from dents yea himself
[1:02:19] hasted also to go out you know sometimes
[1:02:23] we wait till god had to do something
[1:02:25] about it
[1:02:27] sometimes
[1:02:28] we
[1:02:29] we don't listen to god saying i i'm
[1:02:33] going because he love i believe god
[1:02:35] loved this king
[1:02:36] amen because his love for the king he
[1:02:39] smote him with lepers
[1:02:42] he could have killed him and just
[1:02:44] dropped him dead
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:47] are you a man
[1:02:49] because what you're doing is not
[1:02:51] pertaining to you

[1:02:59] do it i do a better job
[1:03:04] you know i i i know i i know what need
[1:03:07] to be done
[1:03:09] you know sometimes folks take matters in
[1:03:11] their own hand
[1:03:13] they don't wait on the lord to handle
[1:03:15] things
[1:03:18] i'm gonna take things in my own hand
[1:03:21] you know you can tell when leprosy
[1:03:24] spiritual legacy had caught a hole
[1:03:26] people began to separate themselves from
[1:03:29] the other people thanks
[1:03:33] why because and because they meant they
[1:03:36] become contagious
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:40] legacy was a type of sin
[1:03:43] and sin will cause you to be separated
[1:03:46] from the people of god and from the
[1:03:49] house of god and from the temple of god
[1:03:53] are you a man
[1:03:55] see sin
[1:03:56] amen immediately when lapis distracts
[1:04:01] even not only did they do it but the
[1:04:04] uzziah did it himself
[1:04:07] are you with me
[1:04:09] but let me go back to isaiah here and uh
[1:04:13] in the year king as i died
[1:04:16] i i won't be long i hopefully
[1:04:19] we we're getting the point home
[1:04:22] in the year king oz i died
[1:04:24] i saw the law
[1:04:28] amen i saw the lord
[1:04:31] praise god evidently
[1:04:33] this man was a prophet of god ordained
[1:04:37] before the foundation of the world yet
[1:04:43] his gift that was in him
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:46] was blinded by a king that he loved and
[1:04:49] admired
[1:04:51] the gift that's in us sometimes
[1:04:55] it meant it's hindered and blind
[1:05:00] by a king
[1:05:02] that we are
[1:05:05] a king
[1:05:09] i want to say who or what is your desire
[1:05:13] that's keeping you from seeing the lord
[1:05:17] what is it who is it or what
[1:05:20] would do that what would blind you
[1:05:23] amen from seeing the lord and and what
[1:05:27] happened to isaiah
[1:05:28] amen us
[1:05:31] he had to die he meant because god
[1:05:34] wanted you to see
[1:05:36] the lord
[1:05:38] when god wants you to see the lord amen
