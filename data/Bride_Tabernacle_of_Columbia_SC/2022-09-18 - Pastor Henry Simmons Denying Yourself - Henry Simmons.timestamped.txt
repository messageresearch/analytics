[45:59] the book of saint matthew 16 chapter
[46:02] familiar scripture the 24th verse
[46:06] i'll read the first you read the next
[46:08] we'll read the last verse together
[46:11] matthew 16 24
[46:15] then said jesus unto his disciples
[46:18] if any man would come after me
[46:21] let him deny himself
[46:24] and take up his cross
[46:26] and follow me
[46:30] 25.
[46:39] for what is a man prophet
[46:42] if he shall gain
[46:44] the whole world
[46:46] and lose his own soul
[46:50] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[46:52] his soul 27.
[47:03] together
[47:04] very literally saying to you
[47:07] there's some of you here we shall not
[47:10] taste it
[47:11] until we see son of man coming in his
[47:14] kingdom
[47:15] may god bless you in this word you may
[47:17] be seated
[47:19] we thank god again
[47:22] for you
[47:23] your patience
[47:25] thank god for
[47:27] each and every every one of the soldiers
[47:29] of the cross
[47:31] those that thought enough about him
[47:35] to be willing to lay down your life for
[47:37] his sake
[47:39] so by the grace of god your presence
[47:42] here today
[47:44] is to say to god lord i'm
[47:47] one of them uh i desire to be one of
[47:50] them in the army of the lord
[47:53] because of your desire to be
[47:55] a christian a soldier
[47:58] for paul's styles as
[48:01] the
[48:02] as a good soldier
[48:06] and that we are in a fight and
[48:10] it's not many people that's fighting you
[48:12] know as brother ernie said the other
[48:14] night
[48:15] there's not many people fighting
[48:18] they're in the army but they're not in
[48:19] it to fight
[48:22] they're in it to be spectators and look
[48:24] homes
[48:27] they don't realize that we're in a war
[48:29] and we're in a battle
[48:34] well you see those that are not
[48:36] desperate in prayer
[48:38] those that not
[48:40] they're not praying
[48:42] because they don't need to pray
[48:45] it's almost we're at peace now
[48:48] everything is going fine we don't need
[48:50] to pray
[48:52] that's the way israel was when
[48:53] everything is going swell and they were
[48:55] prospered
[48:56] it's only when the time of trouble came
[48:58] that they cried to the lord
[49:01] and i'm gonna tell you brother and
[49:02] sister if that's what it takes is that's
[49:03] what god has to do in your life that
[49:06] cause trouble to come then god let
[49:08] trevor come
[49:10] and you wonder why trouble come because
[49:13] that's the only way god's gonna get you
[49:14] when he needs you
[49:16] if trouble don't come you you forget all
[49:19] about him
[49:20] you know
[49:22] so
[49:25] even some things said in the 24 verse he
[49:27] says
[49:28] then said jesus unto the disciples
[49:31] if any man come after me
[49:35] now he was telling you if you're going
[49:37] to come and you're going to follow him
[49:38] or you're going to come after him
[49:41] first of all he says the first thing
[49:43] you've got to do
[49:44] is deny yourself
[49:48] we want to talk about denying yourself
[49:54] the next thing he said
[49:57] you cannot take up your cross until
[50:00] first you deny yourself
[50:06] now
[50:07] many people
[50:09] the reason why they're not taking up the
[50:11] cross because they have not done the
[50:13] first thing
[50:15] they have not denied themselves
[50:19] many people that claim to be followers
[50:22] of jesus christ have not done the first
[50:25] thing
[50:27] there's no
[50:29] time in their christian walk have they
[50:31] come to a place that they denied
[50:34] themselves
[50:38] they went through
[50:40] the outward motion
[50:43] but there was no end with conviction
[50:47] the outward motion that i said the right
[50:50] thing that confess jesus christ as my
[50:52] lord and the savior and i accepted him
[50:54] and i received him but there was nothing
[50:57] in it
[51:00] that caused a real dying out to oneself
[51:05] there was no picking up a cross
[51:07] afterwards
[51:09] for if you do it right
[51:12] if you deny yourself then you're willing
[51:14] to take up the cross
[51:17] but if you haven't done it right then
[51:18] that's never a cross that you ever carry
[51:22] anytime things got tough a little rough
[51:24] and there's a little struggle in the
[51:25] journey look like we thought about my
[51:27] hand and we give up
[51:30] don't take much for us to get in our
[51:33] flesh and
[51:35] and all of that
[51:38] don't play
[51:39] oh lord
[51:41] but if you deny yourself and you take
[51:43] the first approach
[51:45] as a christian you deny yourself first
[51:51] as the prophet god said our greatest
[51:52] enemy and i could have said that as my
[51:54] topic but
[51:57] i use the topic our greatest enemy is
[51:59] ourselves
[52:01] and that's the first thing he asks you
[52:02] to do if you're going to come you got to
[52:04] deny yourself because you he knows that
[52:07] you're your own greatest enemy nobody
[52:09] else on the outside
[52:10] we blame everybody for whatever we're
[52:12] going through and we look for excuse to
[52:15] not look at ourselves
[52:20] the bible said we have not because we
[52:21] ask none
[52:24] it is always somebody else's problem
[52:26] because i'm not spirit i'm not where i
[52:28] need to be things are going on in my
[52:30] life this is happening i don't want to
[52:32] never say it's me it's me oh lord
[52:35] standing in the neither prayer it's me
[52:41] before i can take
[52:43] to
[52:44] talk to y'all about this message i had
[52:47] to let it filter through me
[52:54] sometimes i have to look back over my
[52:57] life and i have to see
[52:58] whether or not i'm fully committed and
[53:00] dedicated to god like i should
[53:05] and then sometimes i see some problems
[53:06] that
[53:07] you know
[53:10] i was telling kelvin johnson seven days
[53:12] a week i think brother gohan was talking
[53:15] about the seven days a week you know i
[53:17] wanted to do something for the lord i
[53:18] wanted to get out in the streets i
[53:19] wanted to talk to somebody about the
[53:21] lord and get out on my knees and pray
[53:23] about it and go in the streets tell
[53:25] somebody about jesus
[53:32] dr caleb and joshua says you're young
[53:34] energetic the first time in your life i
[53:36] said in your life you'll never have this
[53:38] opportunity again
[53:41] so you get married
[53:44] children are coming different things
[53:45] that come up i said but you got the
[53:47] opportunity to give god your all i'm
[53:49] gonna tell you what it
[53:50] the benefits of that
[53:54] i said i want to tell y'all something
[53:56] the benefits is
[53:58] that god will bless your children
[54:02] god will bless your life
[54:04] the wife that you marry it'll be a
[54:06] blessing
[54:07] everything about your life would be a
[54:09] blessing if you would just put god first
[54:11] night
[54:13] the sacrifices you make now amen it'll
[54:17] be a blessing to your children
[54:22] brothers and sisters but see some of us
[54:24] often times we want all the blessings
[54:26] but we don't want to know none of the
[54:27] sacrifices
[54:30] none of the things that god is asking us
[54:32] to do
[54:35] the value of one soul coming to christ
[54:37] one soul coming into the kingdom it's
[54:40] worth more than ten thousand words but
[54:42] yet he meant god wants to use us but we
[54:45] don't wanna we're too busy we're selfish
[54:50] it's not god will be done is
[54:53] yo what i want and what i want to do
[54:55] where i want to go what i want in life
[54:58] it's not
[55:00] we care a little about what god planned
[55:02] for your life what god purposed for you
[55:05] we don't even consult him we just feel
[55:07] like
[55:08] god if you bless me with this gift for
[55:11] this i'll just you know just use it like
[55:15] i want it's not for you
[55:18] when god gives you a gift it's not for
[55:20] you
[55:23] freely you have received freely give
[55:27] god bless you with talents and gifts
[55:30] it's for
[55:31] to be a blessing for the kingdom of god
[55:36] the first thing you look at is the
[55:38] kingdom of god how can i be a blessing
[55:40] to the kingdom
[55:44] god you gave it to me i want to give it
[55:46] back to you
[55:50] a lot of times we care less about
[55:52] whether or not we want to be famous and
[55:54] glorified by the world
[55:57] see
[55:58] let him first what
[56:01] oh i got
[56:03] this degree i got this i've achieved
[56:05] this and that what does that mean in the
[56:07] sight of god nothing
[56:11] all your achievements all that your
[56:13] goals and all your aspirations
[56:16] all that you want to be and all that you
[56:18] want to do it don't mean nothing
[56:20] if god is not
[56:23] in it
[56:26] if god is not in control and god is not
[56:29] first
[56:30] it means nothing
[56:33] and it's not playing around like you
[56:36] amen know what god will and purpose for
[56:39] you because this is what god has blessed
[56:42] me with so i can do this and i want to
[56:44] do that it's all about i want to
[56:52] i tell you 70 make you think about a lot
[56:55] of things god
[56:58] i've been here a long time but
[57:00] a long time it's a very short time
[57:03] but let me get more serious
[57:06] about what's left
[57:09] you could come at any time but what's
[57:11] left
[57:13] what more can i do
[57:16] and don't let me do a whole lot that
[57:18] don't mean nothing
[57:22] that is of less value
[57:26] i'm doing because i i just doing tr you
[57:29] know it's like the prophet said trying
[57:31] to do god's service without it being his
[57:33] will
[57:34] is that the will of god
[57:37] is that something you want to do
[57:40] is that what god wants to do
[57:44] so i said god you know i've done a lot
[57:45] of things
[57:48] and i worked hard
[57:51] but was it god will
[57:55] right now i've got to be more
[57:57] tuned in and got to be
[57:59] more
[58:00] lord i'm more conscious lord i don't
[58:03] want to just move because you know
[58:06] i just don't want to do what i want god
[58:09] you
[58:10] you know give me that macedonia call
[58:12] give me that
[58:13] thing that you
[58:15] you that cry that somebody needs god and
[58:18] i want to use you to minister to them
[58:23] somebody's crying out and i want you to
[58:25] be a vessel that's willing to go and
[58:27] willing to do what i want done
[58:31] i said god that's what i want
[58:34] i don't want to move just because i can
[58:36] somebody says well brother simmons i
[58:37] want you to come over here and preaching
[58:39] over there i don't want to be you know
[58:40] some minutes they just go anywhere and
[58:42] they're doing it i mean
[58:44] god ain't talking you know i know that
[58:50] see sometimes we can worry about
[58:52] a social status of popularity and who's
[58:56] gonna
[58:58] we can worry about a lot of things
[59:01] but what good is that gonna do at the
[59:02] end of the road when god and him
[59:06] it's what's going to be
[59:08] of importance to god whether it's the
[59:10] will of god whether god had a plan a
[59:12] purpose if god's going to use you to his
[59:15] glory you can see somebody come to
[59:16] conviction somebody come to christ
[59:18] somebody give their heart to the lord
[59:20] somebody filled with the spirit somebody
[59:22] healed somebody delivered
[59:26] once you seeing those type of things
[59:28] happening
[59:29] say thank you jesus thank you jesus for
[59:33] putting me
[59:34] in the way
[59:36] thank you jesus for using
[59:38] that because we were obedient to his
[59:42] him
[59:44] god was we were able to be a blessing to
[59:46] others
[59:48] because we were obedient to him
[59:51] sometimes i believe that sometimes it's
[59:53] all about us
[59:55] being a blessing to ourselves
[59:57] what's going to make benefit me
[1:00:02] it's all about me
[1:00:04] it's not about god at all it's about me
[1:00:07] what i want what i think
[1:00:11] a lot of times we evaluate situations
[1:00:14] and we evaluate and we put people on
[1:00:17] different levels and in our minds and we
[1:00:20] have evaluated but we have not looked at
[1:00:22] ourselves
[1:00:25] why am i doing that is it that pleasing
[1:00:28] me what am i looking for what am i
[1:00:31] searching for something to please me or
[1:00:34] is that a hunger and thirst to be closer
[1:00:36] to god and god i want your will to be
[1:00:39] done
[1:00:45] my desires
[1:00:48] to be fulfilled
[1:00:50] or am i crying out to god
[1:00:54] oh god i want your desires what you
[1:00:57] desire lord what you wanting god why how
[1:01:00] you want to use
[1:01:03] so he says
[1:01:05] if any man come after me let him deny
[1:01:07] himself
[1:01:11] take up his cross
[1:01:14] now
[1:01:16] sometimes we want to follow him without
[1:01:18] the cross
[1:01:21] are you with me
[1:01:23] we want to follow jesus
[1:01:26] and we haven't done the first two
[1:01:28] principles
[1:01:30] we haven't denied ourselves
[1:01:35] and we want to follow him without a
[1:01:37] cross
[1:01:40] anytime a cross is in it any time we
[1:01:44] have to carry a cross
[1:01:46] something wrong something wrong in the
[1:01:48] church something wrong in the house
[1:01:50] something wrong in the marriage
[1:01:52] something wrong oh
[1:01:57] there's got to be something wrong with
[1:01:59] when a cross is involved amen we we
[1:02:02] think something is wrong
[1:02:06] there's a problem i got to get rid of
[1:02:08] this marriage i got to get rid of this
[1:02:10] uh
[1:02:11] these are where did your children come
[1:02:13] from they come from you
[1:02:18] i don't want to deal with them they're
[1:02:20] they bad they they're this in that way
[1:02:23] y'all get that from you got it from your
[1:02:24] daddy
[1:02:26] no the daddy said you got it from your
[1:02:28] mama
[1:02:30] there's always an excuse
[1:02:32] but when it comes down to amen being
[1:02:35] parents and and
[1:02:37] looking to god that this is the cross
[1:02:39] that we have to carry we're going to
[1:02:41] have some problems the children going to
[1:02:43] go through certain things the family
[1:02:45] going to go through the marriages don't
[1:02:46] go through certain things we're going to
[1:02:48] have to have a cross
[1:02:50] well where there is no cross there's no
[1:02:52] crown
[1:02:55] well there's no suffering there's no
[1:02:57] reigning
[1:03:00] are you with me
[1:03:02] so don't look at the cross as being
[1:03:04] something terrible look at the cross
[1:03:07] that
[1:03:08] oh lord
[1:03:09] what he says
[1:03:12] in second timothy 3 you don't have to
[1:03:14] turn in 12. he said yea
[1:03:16] and all that will live godly in christ
[1:03:18] jesus
[1:03:20] shall suffer what
[1:03:22] persecution
[1:03:26] and all that will live godly if you live
[1:03:28] in a god of life you're going to suffer
[1:03:30] persecution
[1:03:33] but that part that part we don't as
[1:03:36] christians we don't want that part of it
[1:03:40] but that is the christian's life that is
[1:03:43] what makes a christian a christian
[1:03:46] they gotta suffer because there's a
[1:03:48] cross
[1:03:51] there's a denied one self we don't want
[1:03:54] amen oh god to come from among the world
[1:03:58] in the things of the world
[1:04:00] we want to hold on to the world and the
[1:04:02] friendship of the world and the people
[1:04:05] of the world associates amen the the the
[1:04:09] schoolmates and the amen
[1:04:12] people on the job and friends
[1:04:15] sometimes we got to walk away from it
[1:04:16] all
[1:04:18] our friends have not seen
[1:04:21] can two walk together except to be in
[1:04:23] agreement
[1:04:27] can light and darkness dwell in the same
[1:04:30] place
[1:04:32] the bible said if we walk in the light
[1:04:34] it sees in the light
[1:04:37] amen
[1:04:39] then we have fellowship one with another
[1:04:43] amen
[1:04:46] see i i i i i i i we want fellowship
[1:04:50] with the with the world and sometimes we
[1:04:52] think that we're isolated we want to be
[1:04:55] isolated and insulated
[1:04:58] we don't want i you know we don't want
[1:05:00] the world in and we isolate ourselves
[1:05:03] and insulate ourselves and make sure
[1:05:05] that we are so safe come on
[1:05:10] we want to vindicate ourselves and make
[1:05:12] ourselves
[1:05:14] so that our light is shining so bright
[1:05:17] that we have to do something to to
[1:05:19] separate ourselves
[1:05:21] your life that you live will cause
[1:05:23] separation
[1:05:26] you don't have to say well i i i don't
[1:05:28] want nothing to do with you
[1:05:32] they don't want nothing to do with you
[1:05:36] light and darkness don't mix together
[1:05:40] now if they
[1:05:41] if you got to say i don't want nothing
[1:05:43] to do with you something wrong
[1:05:48] because which one is stronger
[1:05:51] the darkness of the light
[1:05:56] so if you light you don't have to worry
[1:05:58] about the darkness because the darkness
[1:06:00] don't want the light
[1:06:02] the bible says the light shining in the
[1:06:04] darkness and the darkness is
[1:06:05] comprehended and not
[1:06:09] are you with me
[1:06:11] sometimes we're so afraid of the sinner
[1:06:13] and so afraid of them that we want to
[1:06:16] cause ourselves i want nothing to do
[1:06:18] with don't come by my house no no no no
[1:06:19] no no no
[1:06:21] it's your opportunity to tell them about
[1:06:24] jesus
[1:06:27] and if they don't want to hear about
[1:06:29] jesus they ain't coming by to see you
[1:06:33] not that you want to be uh all in and
[1:06:36] all
[1:06:36] but i'm saying your life itself is it
[1:06:39] lifts up a standard against them
[1:06:43] your life that you live
[1:06:46] lift up or standing
[1:06:49] they feel condemned even in your house
[1:06:51] and in your presence on the job in the
[1:06:53] school they already feel condemned
[1:06:57] because they know something about you
[1:06:59] that's different from them and those
[1:07:01] demons that they gotta hold to
[1:07:04] it's different
[1:07:07] it caused them to tremble
[1:07:10] the bible said the devil's
[1:07:11] the devil bleed but he trembles
[1:07:14] you believe that there's one god but he
[1:07:16] trembles
[1:07:18] are you with me
[1:07:22] can i go a little further
[1:07:24] now
[1:07:26] the last stage spirit in second timothy
[1:07:28] here
[1:07:29] second timothy three

[1:07:44] greatest enemy

[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:43] see sometimes

[1:12:52] that we're going to get stoned if we

[1:13:28] what are the benefits
[1:13:32] mama unhappy daddy unhappy people in the
[1:13:34] church ain't happy
[1:13:39] if it's something about if it's gonna
[1:13:41] make you happy why aren't they happy
[1:13:45] why aren't people dancing and shouting
[1:13:48] the world is dancing their part and
[1:13:50] they're getting hot they enjoying it why
[1:13:52] people enjoying jesus
[1:13:55] if he's supposed to make you have
[1:13:58] happy
[1:14:00] he's gonna make you dance
[1:14:02] amen he's gonna make you shout
[1:14:05] amen he's something that you wake up
[1:14:08] good morning jesus i love you
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:13] praise god
[1:14:16] brother and sister
[1:14:17] sometimes our examples
[1:14:20] has been presented
[1:14:22] and we wonder how jesus is looking at us
[1:14:28] when do we understand our plight
[1:14:31] or the journey that we're on
[1:14:33] do you really recognize and understand
[1:14:35] it
[1:14:37] do you understand the purpose of the
[1:14:38] cross
[1:14:40] it's not for jesus
[1:14:42] he's already carried his
[1:14:45] the things that he's actually you don't
[1:14:47] endure
[1:14:48] and the things that he's asking you to
[1:14:50] stand for and stand with him
[1:14:54] because it's not for his good
[1:14:58] it's for your good
[1:15:02] are you with me
[1:15:03] he's looking out for you even though you
[1:15:06] don't realize you he's looking out for
[1:15:08] you the things that he asks you to do is
[1:15:11] not going to make him anymore god he's
[1:15:13] already god
[1:15:15] praise god it's not going to elevate him
[1:15:17] it's not
[1:15:19] said we have fathers in the flesh
[1:15:23] that corrects us for their own pleasure
[1:15:25] but god
[1:15:26] is for ours
[1:15:29] are you a man
[1:15:36] ii timothy three
[1:15:40] this is what you're battling brother and
[1:15:42] sister
[1:15:43] this is what you're facing but you don't
[1:15:46] see
[1:15:46] you got to come face to face that god is
[1:15:48] looking out for you
[1:15:51] you may not understand the good that's
[1:15:54] in this now
[1:15:56] amen but we understand it better bye bye
[1:16:00] when the morning come
[1:16:02] things that god is oh lord for this no
[1:16:07] just know also
[1:16:09] that in the last days
[1:16:12] do we believe we're there
[1:16:14] the dangerous perilous times shall we
[1:16:18] come and one of the first things that he
[1:16:21] had to deal with
[1:16:25] that men shall be what
[1:16:31] jesus the first thing he said if any man
[1:16:35] if you come after him me
[1:16:37] let him what
[1:16:40] so paul picks it up and
[1:16:42] and he says
[1:16:44] then i'm going to tell you what's going
[1:16:45] to happen in the
[1:16:46] last days
[1:16:49] there's going to be some dangerous
[1:16:50] troubled times
[1:16:52] and in these troubled times i want to
[1:16:54] tell you the attitude of the world
[1:17:00] he's speaking to the church and telling
[1:17:02] the church what they're going to face in
[1:17:03] the future
[1:17:06] and he's trying to warn you of these
[1:17:08] spirits and tell you amen i want you to
[1:17:10] identify amen what's happening with you
[1:17:12] what's going on in your life and what
[1:17:14] you're facing i want you to see your
[1:17:16] battle i want you to see what you got to
[1:17:18] deal with what you got to fight
[1:17:22] are you with me
[1:17:25] so he says knowing this
[1:17:27] amen
[1:17:29] troubled times dangerous time for men
[1:17:31] should be lovers of their own self
[1:17:35] so your greatest enemy is yourself and
[1:17:37] you got to deal with yourself and you
[1:17:39] got to deny yourself
[1:17:44] now
[1:17:46] the vindication of the evidence that
[1:17:48] you've denied yourself
[1:17:50] is that you've taken up your cross
[1:17:55] are you with me
[1:17:58] but if you said you denied yourself and
[1:18:00] there's no cross that you're carrying
[1:18:04] then i doubt
[1:18:06] seriously that you denied yourself
[1:18:09] because the next step in the one self is
[1:18:12] taking up the cross
[1:18:15] so you don't complain about your journey
[1:18:17] about your flight about the things that
[1:18:19] you go do because you know that all
[1:18:22] things
[1:18:24] work together for what
[1:18:27] so you know that you're suffering of
[1:18:28] this present time and not
[1:18:30] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:18:32] that shall be revealed in you
[1:18:36] are you with me
[1:18:37] so the things that you go through
[1:18:38] thinking not strange concerning the amen
[1:18:41] fiery trials which are going to try you
[1:18:44] oh you look man but counted all joy when
[1:18:47] you fall into the diver's temptation
[1:18:50] are you with me
[1:18:52] when you go through different
[1:18:53] temptatious kind of joy and say lord
[1:18:56] thank you
[1:18:57] lord i'm happy because you are in
[1:18:59] control
[1:19:01] god thank you lord god you are my
[1:19:04] deliverer you're my healer sickness may
[1:19:07] come death may come problems may come
[1:19:10] situations may come but lord thank you
[1:19:15] hallelujah
[1:19:17] hey god bless jesus about to cross alone
[1:19:21] in all the world go free no there's a
[1:19:23] cross for everyone and there's a cross
[1:19:25] for me
[1:19:26] are you with me
[1:19:28] so if i gotta find a way that i'm gonna
[1:19:30] praise the lord regardless of my
[1:19:32] circumstances regardless of my condition
[1:19:35] i'm gonna find a way amen if i don't
[1:19:37] have but one little hand let me raise
[1:19:39] that hand and say thank you
[1:19:42] amen if i don't have but one leg let me
[1:19:44] give that praise god sister robinson
[1:19:47] didn't have no legs but she was kicking
[1:19:49] the nerves
[1:19:50] she was lifting up the nubs in the
[1:19:52] wheelchair and she was praising the lord
[1:19:55] like she had when she had to let you she
[1:19:57] was praising the lord when she didn't
[1:19:58] have no leg she was still praising the
[1:20:01] law oh god hallelujah
[1:20:06] praise god
[1:20:07] that reminds me gene
[1:20:10] the son-in-law going to preach for us
[1:20:11] friday night
[1:20:12] brother gene
[1:20:14] whatever but see
[1:20:16] i i'm going to tell you something we got
[1:20:18] enough weight
[1:20:20] to hold us down
[1:20:22] won't even let us lift our hands we'll
[1:20:24] let us stand on our feet i'm gonna tell
[1:20:26] you something you read the book a song
[1:20:28] you're gonna read the book a song he's
[1:20:29] gonna tell you to come in the house let
[1:20:31] us stand let us worship let us praise
[1:20:33] the lord amen
[1:20:35] either we believe that or
[1:20:37] or it's for somebody else
[1:20:39] is it for us
[1:20:42] we're going to praise the lord or we're
[1:20:44] going to sit there and look
[1:20:45] god didn't tell you to come in the house
[1:20:46] and be a spectator and just be looking
[1:20:49] he told you to come and praise the lord
[1:20:52] are you what man and if we can't praise
[1:20:54] the lord we're in the wrong place
[1:20:56] because amen the folks don't go to the
[1:20:58] club they meant looking to hear
[1:21:01] a sermon
[1:21:03] are you a man
[1:21:05] they when you come to church david said
[1:21:07] i was happy if i can't be glad something
[1:21:09] wrong not with the church something
[1:21:12] wrong with me
[1:21:14] because i was glad i'm obeying god it's
[1:21:17] for god to take care of all the
[1:21:18] situations and problems that ain't my
[1:21:20] problem i'm gonna do what god said
[1:21:22] forget about what everybody else
[1:21:25] they ask for me in my house
[1:21:29] i'm going to serve the lord
[1:21:31] it's all about amen i'm obeying god i'm
[1:21:33] doing what he said for me to do if you
[1:21:36] don't do it that's up to you
[1:21:40] praise god
[1:21:42] i ain't gonna let no rock
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:48] i'ma praise god while i got a chance
[1:21:51] praise god
[1:21:52] sometimes the devil coming
[1:21:55] all kinds of little things happen to us
[1:21:58] but are we are we doing what we're
[1:21:59] supposed to do with what we got
[1:22:03] the
[1:22:05] the one talent that we got the one
[1:22:07] little gift we got are we using that
[1:22:11] the little strength that we got are we
[1:22:13] raising these hands
[1:22:16] are we saying lord i thank you
[1:22:21] but he says we battle with
[1:22:24] dying to ourselves denying ourselves
[1:22:30] we battle with that because we didn't
[1:22:33] if we hadn't denied ourselves we're
[1:22:34] always going to have inward battles we
[1:22:36] don't
[1:22:37] we want it to be somebody else we want
[1:22:39] to be something or somebody said to us
[1:22:41] somebody did to us we want to have a
[1:22:44] reason for not serving the lord not
[1:22:46] worshiping the lord amen and then
[1:22:48] sometimes our sin wears down
[1:22:53] our sin on wales to keep us from
[1:22:55] praising the lord
[1:22:57] our our mindset how we think or keep us
[1:23:01] and usually that's because
[1:23:03] is
[1:23:04] our sins
[1:23:06] we don't feel worthy to pray to the lord
[1:23:09] we don't feel like we're in the right
[1:23:10] condition to praise him
[1:23:13] so
[1:23:14] if that's not our problem then we have
[1:23:17] no problem
[1:23:19] no reason
[1:23:21] because a senator don't want to praise
[1:23:22] god because they're worshiping the devil
[1:23:25] are you with me
[1:23:27] but if we worship the law we want to
[1:23:28] praise him
[1:23:30] well i don't have to prove to nobody
[1:23:31] nothing you're proving nobody
[1:23:33] anything one way they'll you're just
[1:23:35] proving that
[1:23:36] to the devil that he got you bound up
[1:23:40] if he got you bound up why am i bound oh
[1:23:42] somebody did this somebody said that uh
[1:23:44] no no no no no no no no no
[1:23:49] the joy that i have what
[1:23:52] and what
[1:23:55] you got to give it up
[1:23:57] if you don't have your praise you don't
[1:23:59] have your testimonies you can't worship
[1:24:01] you gave the devil that place
[1:24:04] because his shoulder can't come behind
[1:24:06] you fortified behind the word
[1:24:08] the devil can't come and he can't cross
[1:24:10] the bloodline
[1:24:12] you got to go out to him he ain't he
[1:24:14] can't come in here and take your praise
[1:24:16] from you
[1:24:18] you ain't gonna take my praise from me
[1:24:21] but what happened is you have no praise
[1:24:23] then you have no victory
[1:24:27] that the prophet said dancing is a is a
[1:24:29] sign that you have victory
[1:24:32] amen and you ain't got no victory you
[1:24:33] ain't got no dance

[1:28:43] on the lord
[1:28:47] he said
[1:28:51] the purpose of the cross
[1:28:54] that you're caring it's because you
[1:28:56] understand
[1:28:58] how much jesus loves you
[1:29:03] when you
[1:29:04] understand the love of god
[1:29:09] and you appreciate
[1:29:11] the love of god
[1:29:14] that the gift of god is eternal life
[1:29:18] that he gives you eternal life
[1:29:25] it means more than
[1:29:27] my life
[1:29:31] it means more than everything
[1:29:36] the coming experience the love of christ
[1:29:41] it means everything to me
[1:29:44] and that's what i'm saying brothers and
[1:29:46] sisters the lord says
[1:29:48] and i believe it's god maybe y'all might
[1:29:51] say well brother sam why you said the
[1:29:52] lord say
[1:29:54] it's not you saying it
[1:29:56] no that's why i said i believe if it's
[1:29:58] the lord it spoke to my heart
[1:30:04] god's love got to be revealed to you
[1:30:09] paul said when he pleased god
[1:30:12] which called me by his grace
[1:30:14] to reveal his son
[1:30:16] in me
[1:30:18] in other words i had to come in contact
[1:30:21] with the one that gave himself for me
[1:30:24] i had to understand how much he cared
[1:30:26] about me
[1:30:28] and that god really loved me
[1:30:30] he loved me so dearly and so much
[1:30:34] that he gave his life for me
[1:30:38] i'm not living this life and
[1:30:40] i'm not wearing dresses because i have
[1:30:41] to i'm not amen i'm not partying and
[1:30:44] going to the excessive riding because i
[1:30:47] have to
[1:30:50] you're not in this marriage because
[1:30:52] amen
[1:30:54] of the law
[1:30:57] you're not loving your husband because
[1:31:03] some law making you forcing you somebody
[1:31:06] making you
[1:31:10] you ought to be in the marriage because
[1:31:11] you love one another
[1:31:16] if you're in christ and you don't love
[1:31:18] him then i see that it makes it
[1:31:21] difficult it's a difficult marriage and
[1:31:23] it's difficult amen to treat one another
[1:31:26] right if you don't love him
[1:31:30] if you don't if you're not concerned
[1:31:32] about their
[1:31:33] their pain and their hurt and the things
[1:31:35] that they go through hij well did you
[1:31:38] have a good day
[1:31:39] you love your children
[1:31:41] how i had school today well uh what what
[1:31:44] you go through today how's your job
[1:31:46] today what you're going through amen
[1:31:49] because you love them you're concerned
[1:31:50] about them they know that you care
[1:31:55] but you don't never ask how you doing
[1:31:59] what happened today
[1:32:01] what did you go through what was new
[1:32:04] then they sat down and they talked about
[1:32:06] that and shared and you said
[1:32:08] some things you have to let's pray about
[1:32:10] that let's let's go in prayer with that
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:16] there's no communication
[1:32:19] you know no communication no
[1:32:21] consideration
[1:32:24] but i understood that
[1:32:27] i try to
[1:32:29] raise your children
[1:32:30] to fall in love with jesus
[1:32:34] and the the reason why
[1:32:37] you don't do certain things is because
[1:32:39] you love him
[1:32:43] and that's the same way you approach a
[1:32:44] marriage
[1:32:47] you are it ought to be based off of the
[1:32:50] love
[1:32:52] it ought to not be based off of
[1:32:55] i like the way she looked
[1:32:59] oh he's a nice hamster young man
[1:33:02] it ought to be character based
[1:33:07] in order you ought to be seeing
[1:33:09] character
[1:33:10] and what we saw in jesus was character
[1:33:16] and we fell in love with his character
[1:33:19] and not only with his characters what
[1:33:22] he's done for me
[1:33:25] what nobody else could do for me
[1:33:28] amen he done something for me
[1:33:31] brother sister i was wretched and undone
[1:33:36] without god or his son
[1:33:38] but when he reached
[1:33:41] down his hand for me
[1:33:44] amen i'm so glad he reached down his
[1:33:46] hand for me
[1:33:48] praise god it's not what i've done but
[1:33:50] what he done for me
[1:33:53] it made me want to
[1:33:57] amen because one day i didn't know what
[1:33:59] he'd done for me i heard about it but i
[1:34:02] didn't really know it i went to church
[1:34:04] and they talked to me about it my mama
[1:34:06] told me about it my sisters told me
[1:34:09] about different ones told me but i
[1:34:10] didn't know for myself
[1:34:14] but one day he came to me amen and i saw
[1:34:18] how much he cared about me
[1:34:22] i was able
[1:34:25] to turn around and say lord i love you
[1:34:27] too
[1:34:29] lord i thank you too i i appreciate it
[1:34:34] didn't know it all the time i heard
[1:34:36] about it but i didn't have an experience
[1:34:40] but when i experienced it
[1:34:44] amen praise god i was willing to do
[1:34:47] anything
[1:34:49] i was willing to go i wanted to live
[1:34:51] right
[1:34:53] why because i fell in love with about
[1:34:56] what my soul needed what i was longing
[1:34:58] for didn't know it
[1:35:02] there was a deep calling to the deed
[1:35:05] and it deep responded
[1:35:07] there was something that i needed but i
[1:35:09] didn't know what i needed
[1:35:12] something that oh god
[1:35:16] but when he came
[1:35:20] then came jesus
[1:35:23] hallelujah
[1:35:25] brother when you're in that valley of
[1:35:26] decision and you don't know which way to
[1:35:28] go then came jesus
[1:35:30] when you're in a crossroad and not know
[1:35:32] what to do with your life then came
[1:35:34] jesus
[1:35:36] amen he came right down when i was they
[1:35:38] man all turned and twisted and don't
[1:35:41] know what i'm gonna do in my life

[1:35:46] know what i was gonna do what i was
[1:35:48] gonna do i was gonna hang on
[1:35:50] what's next
[1:35:52] but jesus came
[1:35:55] at my crossroads
[1:35:58] he came to see about me
[1:36:01] put a desire in my heart to serve him
[1:36:04] praise god because i didn't have that
[1:36:06] desire
[1:36:07] i didn't have him in the picture
[1:36:09] too young
[1:36:11] too much
[1:36:12] that i wanted to experience
[1:36:14] but i'm so glad
[1:36:16] that he came to see about me
[1:36:19] are you with me
[1:36:24] maybe i'll
[1:36:25] i won't get into
[1:36:26] the last day spirit but
[1:36:28] i'm going to tell you something
[1:36:32] romans tells us
[1:36:34] that
[1:36:37] see something about
[1:36:38] connecting with him
[1:36:43] roman said what shall separate me
[1:36:52] he said who should separate me
[1:36:54] from the love of christ
[1:36:59] see that's what i'm saying you when you
[1:37:01] become one with that love
[1:37:04] the holy ghost
[1:37:07] the shed of the broad the love of god
[1:37:09] shed it brought in your heart by the
[1:37:10] holy ghost

[1:37:17] don't let
[1:37:18] nobody who
[1:37:21] didn't say what he said who
[1:37:24] who should separate us
[1:37:27] from the love of christ
[1:37:29] he said shall
[1:37:30] tribulation
[1:37:33] that's 8 and 35
[1:37:36] tribulation romans 8 35 uh distress or
[1:37:40] what
[1:37:41] persecution of famine a necklace of
[1:37:44] pearls or swole
[1:37:48] are you with me
[1:37:50] he said as it is written
[1:37:53] for god's sake we are what
[1:37:56] killed we are killed all the day long we
[1:37:59] are counted as what
[1:38:03] it's kind of the sheep for the slaughter
[1:38:07] name and all these things will what
[1:38:14] hallelujah think about it when that love
[1:38:17] become real to you
[1:38:19] when the love of god becomes so real to
[1:38:21] you when you know that he loves you when
[1:38:24] you know that you love him it becomes so
[1:38:26] real
[1:38:28] it's it magnifies itself above all that
[1:38:32] the devil has offered
[1:38:35] praise god it's not compared the world
[1:38:38] give me this whole world it's not
[1:38:41] no comparison to my soul because
