[54:40] i'm so happy tonight or this morning
[54:44] [Music]
[54:46] that god was gracious to me
[54:48] [Music]
[54:51] i think sometimes we take it all for
[54:54] granted
[54:58] the salvation of the lord
[55:02] but i'm trusting
[55:07] that god will do a great work in our
[55:09] lives today
[55:14] if you would turn with me to
[55:18] the scriptures
[55:25] we ask that you turn there's several
[55:26] things i'm trying to think of what to do
[55:28] and how to direct it
[55:31] but i know god is with us this morning
[55:35] there's a lot of thoughts
[55:38] that i like to bring this morning so
[55:42] let's just turn
[55:44] to isaiah 43.
[55:48] isaiah 43
[55:52] how many of y'all really believe the
[55:54] word
[55:55] i know it's hot and i probably shouldn't
[55:57] have sang that fast song but
[56:00] i just kind of wanted to
[56:02] you know
[56:04] uh
[56:06] get the blood going in
[56:08] and by god's grace uh
[56:10] i just take my time here this morning
[56:13] when everything has that's been said
[56:17] uh i know that uh
[56:20] the lord is
[56:21] faithful
[56:25] let's go to isaiah
[56:29] uh 43 beginning at the first verse
[56:35] but now thus said the lord
[56:38] that created thee o jacob
[56:42] and he that created and see o jacob and
[56:45] he that formed thee o israel
[56:48] fear not
[56:50] for i have redeemed thee
[56:52] i have called thee by my name
[56:56] and thou art mine
[56:58] when thou passes through the waters
[57:02] i will be with thee
[57:04] and through the rivers
[57:06] they shall not overflow thee
[57:08] and when thou walketh through the
[57:10] fire thou shall not be burned
[57:14] neither shall the flame
[57:16] kindle upon thee
[57:18] for i am the lord thy god
[57:21] the holy one of israel
[57:23] thy savior
[57:24] i gave egypt for thy ransom in ethiopia
[57:28] and siva for thee
[57:31] since thou was precious
[57:33] in my sight
[57:35] thou has been
[57:36] honorable and i have loved thee
[57:39] therefore will i give thee give men for
[57:42] thee and people for thy life
[57:46] let us pray
[57:49] our gracious father
[57:52] we thank you for being so good to us
[57:56] we thank you for being
[57:57] our all in all
[58:00] and we pray uh this morning
[58:03] that you have preeminence here lord
[58:07] destroy the works of the enemy
[58:10] opens our hearts and our minds to your
[58:12] word
[58:14] and we'll be careful to give you the
[58:15] praise
[58:16] glory and honor
[58:18] in jesus christ's name
[58:20] amen
[58:22] you may be seated
[58:27] on the last
[58:29] time i spoke i
[58:31] spoke of the urgency
[58:34] of how things is really urgent
[58:38] and i believe that
[58:42] oftentimes people don't understand
[58:46] that word urgent
[58:49] most of the time when something becomes
[58:51] urgent
[58:53] it produces like a desperation
[58:56] i got to get it done i got to get it
[58:58] done now
[59:02] uh
[59:03] just in in life
[59:06] we know how
[59:08] a bill may come and they say well if you
[59:10] don't get it
[59:11] paid by this time of the day
[59:14] we're going to cut your lights off or
[59:16] we're going to cut your water off and
[59:18] you know it's amazing
[59:21] because we find ourselves more concerned
[59:25] about what the neighbors are going to
[59:26] think
[59:28] when they see the water man or the
[59:30] electric man out there cutting our
[59:32] lights off it's
[59:33] it's a it's nothing but a spirit of
[59:35] pride
[59:38] hallelujah
[59:39] but the urgency should not come because
[59:42] we're concerned about what others think
[59:46] but you need your lights to be remain on
[59:50] or your water to remain on but
[59:52] nevertheless you do whatever you can do
[59:55] to get that done
[59:58] is that right
[59:59] and you and i when we talk about
[1:00:02] urgency
[1:00:04] i think in zechariah that tells us that
[1:00:07] when the vision has been made clear
[1:00:11] with made plain
[1:00:13] let him that readeth run
[1:00:17] because once that vision
[1:00:19] of the end time has made been made plain
[1:00:23] and clear to us
[1:00:25] a god amen will not tarry
[1:00:28] he's not going to wait on you
[1:00:31] right i mean the truth of the matter is
[1:00:34] god has a set time and an appointed time
[1:00:39] to do what needs to be done
[1:00:42] and god will send warnings
[1:00:44] he'll give us grace and then to hear the
[1:00:47] warnings and sometimes people just
[1:00:50] ignore the warnings
[1:00:53] for an example when pearl harbor
[1:00:57] when the japanese were going to bomb
[1:00:59] pearl harbor you know the american
[1:01:02] soldiers we had heard that the japanese
[1:01:06] were planning to bomb us
[1:01:08] but because of our pride because of our
[1:01:10] arrogancy uh we we ignored it
[1:01:14] we went on partying and having a great
[1:01:17] time
[1:01:18] but you see it never stopped the
[1:01:20] japanese
[1:01:22] from bombing pearl harbor
[1:01:25] yeah understand me
[1:01:26] it it was a time of urgency
[1:01:29] they heard the warning
[1:01:31] but they ignored it
[1:01:34] and anytime you hear an alarm go off on
[1:01:38] urgency something that's urgent amen you
[1:01:41] you you you have a right to to hear it
[1:01:45] and you have a right to ignore it
[1:01:48] hallelujah is that right now we know by
[1:01:51] god's grace when we see a fire truck or
[1:01:54] a police car or an alarm that goes off
[1:01:57] and then we know immediately to stop
[1:02:01] and to look around to see
[1:02:03] which direction that urgent vehicle is
[1:02:06] coming
[1:02:07] and we respect that right we'll pull
[1:02:10] over to the side and give that situation
[1:02:13] a man a priority
[1:02:16] but you still have a right
[1:02:19] you can
[1:02:20] take heed to it or you can actually
[1:02:23] ignore it and then when you ignore it
[1:02:25] you're bound to get in some type of
[1:02:28] accident
[1:02:29] hallelujah even because there's an
[1:02:31] urgency
[1:02:33] a situation going on
[1:02:36] that's how it was amen when the uh the
[1:02:39] the woman whose son died uh from a
[1:02:43] headstroke
[1:02:45] and elijah had given this woman it meant
[1:02:47] a son
[1:02:48] by way of of the spoken word
[1:02:51] right
[1:02:52] and this son grew up
[1:02:54] and perhaps what happened the father out
[1:02:56] in the field and then all of a sudden
[1:02:58] something happened maybe he had a
[1:03:00] sunstroke of some sort but nevertheless
[1:03:02] he fell dead
[1:03:04] and this woman who could not have a son
[1:03:08] told her servant
[1:03:10] said whatever you do
[1:03:12] don't you stop for nothing
[1:03:16] cause she hadn't tried everything elijah
[1:03:19] had left behind but she found out it
[1:03:22] wasn't working
[1:03:24] you see what i'm saying
[1:03:26] when you find out that you pray for
[1:03:28] something and it's not working
[1:03:31] it should produce an urgency
[1:03:35] somebody help me here
[1:03:37] see you and i must understand what we're
[1:03:40] talking about this morning is a matter
[1:03:42] of life and death
[1:03:44] huh
[1:03:45] and so what happens
[1:03:47] she tells her servant that's why i try
[1:03:49] to tell people when you're in a in a
[1:03:52] situation and you gotta run the red
[1:03:54] light
[1:03:56] don't stop
[1:04:00] right it's an urgency and you know time
[1:04:02] is not on your side
[1:04:06] hallelujah
[1:04:07] and in the word of god said elijah saw
[1:04:09] coming from a distance and god had not
[1:04:12] even shown him the situation
[1:04:15] oh
[1:04:16] but it's a wonderful thing when you know
[1:04:17] you got somebody you can turn to
[1:04:20] in a time of need hallelujah
[1:04:22] so what happens hey man she she says
[1:04:25] whatever you do wishing god uh saw
[1:04:28] elijah this is the thing when she saw
[1:04:30] elijah and elijah saw her he he he
[1:04:34] herald to her
[1:04:35] how you doing
[1:04:37] what's happening is everything all right
[1:04:40] she didn't say oh my goodness my son is
[1:04:43] dead and it looks like there's no hope
[1:04:45] you know what she said
[1:04:48] all is well
[1:04:52] y'all understand me your attitude in
[1:04:55] every situation must remain positive
[1:04:59] hallelujah why because out of your love
[1:05:03] our creed will perceive
[1:05:05] words of
[1:05:06] creation whether it's to destroy you or
[1:05:10] to build you up
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:14] oh god help us in
[1:05:18] so there's an urgency
[1:05:20] and i liken it to that time
[1:05:23] when this woman had to get to elijah
[1:05:26] stop for
[1:05:27] nothing
[1:05:29] we're talking about
[1:05:31] the resurrection
[1:05:33] this is what we're working with this
[1:05:35] morning because you and i must
[1:05:37] understand this message that god has
[1:05:39] brought to us in this day is different
[1:05:42] from the message of the lay of the seas
[1:05:45] this message amen ties into matthew 25
[1:05:50] with ten versions a man
[1:05:53] heard a cry at midnight
[1:05:55] and they went to meet
[1:05:58] right
[1:05:59] the bible said they all had lamps and
[1:06:02] had all in their lamps
[1:06:04] but you see five of them were wise and
[1:06:07] five was foolish
[1:06:10] and the foolish virgins listened they
[1:06:13] were clean living people
[1:06:16] i'm not talking about belonging to a
[1:06:18] church and you're still living any kind
[1:06:20] of way but these people were clean
[1:06:23] living people
[1:06:26] y'all hear me
[1:06:28] so what happened here man these these
[1:06:30] virgins the five ran out of oil
[1:06:34] and right now
[1:06:35] this is what i see
[1:06:38] people either you're running out of oil
[1:06:44] running low on oil
[1:06:47] something is happening
[1:06:49] but one thing i could truly say to you
[1:06:52] this morning amen no matter what it is
[1:06:54] when you find your prayer life going
[1:06:56] down
[1:06:58] you see that the love that you have for
[1:07:00] god seem to be
[1:07:02] you know growing small
[1:07:05] you're not witnessing
[1:07:07] you're not praying
[1:07:08] you're not fasting that's when you get
[1:07:11] down on your knees
[1:07:13] somebody help me here
[1:07:15] that's the time you refill
[1:07:18] because we need refilling every day
[1:07:23] don't you let your oil run out
[1:07:29] i'm coming
[1:07:31] so we realized by god's grace
[1:07:35] these wise virgins had oil
[1:07:38] and they had extra oil
[1:07:41] hallelujah i'm just going to stop right
[1:07:43] there
[1:07:44] because we're living in if i could say
[1:07:46] it like this
[1:07:47] we're living in the day or the hour of
[1:07:50] the resurrection
[1:07:55] we've been promised a rapture
[1:07:58] and everybody's been somewhat looking
[1:08:01] for it
[1:08:03] but there are those who are losing the
[1:08:06] expectation
[1:08:08] of seeing a rapture
[1:08:10] because it's been spoken of for so long
[1:08:14] but what people do not understand is
[1:08:17] that this rapture is a secret
[1:08:21] it is not you're not going to find it on
[1:08:24] youtube
[1:08:26] you're not going to find it on facebook
[1:08:29] you're not going to find this rapture
[1:08:31] amen in the newspaper
[1:08:34] hearing itself
[1:08:36] the rapture will take place
[1:08:39] in 10 days
[1:08:41] and you know what the attitude of the
[1:08:43] people would be
[1:08:44] if they knew that that time and the
[1:08:47] exact date and the exact hour you know
[1:08:50] what they would say well i might as well
[1:08:52] party a little bit
[1:08:55] right now
[1:08:56] i got 10 days to work it
[1:09:00] you understand me
[1:09:02] you don't give people that kind of time
[1:09:06] because we weak within ourselves
[1:09:11] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:09:13] oh it is just what we do
[1:09:15] if we do it on a common uh grounds we
[1:09:19] know a bill that needs to be paid 10
[1:09:21] days
[1:09:23] and we see a little suit or a nice dress
[1:09:27] and we know the bill needs to be paid
[1:09:31] but i got 10 more days
[1:09:36] we do stuff like that it's just the
[1:09:38] natural
[1:09:39] it's what we do
[1:09:41] and god knows us
[1:09:44] hallelujah that's why he said be ready
[1:09:49] oh lord here i come
[1:09:52] i used to wonder
[1:09:54] how this thing was going to take place
[1:09:57] but let me tell you something god always
[1:09:59] announces it he announced the birth of
[1:10:03] jesus
[1:10:04] it may have taken a long time
[1:10:07] but it got here
[1:10:10] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:10:12] and regardless of how long it took there
[1:10:14] was still a few people waiting for it
[1:10:17] there was some an expectation to see it
[1:10:21] see god has never left himself without a
[1:10:24] witness
[1:10:26] now i'm getting ready i'm going to say
[1:10:28] something now
[1:10:29] because the announcement of god
[1:10:33] translation
[1:10:35] is a revelation
[1:10:37] that's only given to the elected
[1:10:42] it's not given to everybody
[1:10:45] just like everybody don't see angels
[1:10:49] hallelujah see god is god is god is
[1:10:52] awesome
[1:10:53] i think about the economy of god let me
[1:10:55] stop that you know the economy god i
[1:10:58] said god is so awesome i just can't
[1:11:00] hardly wait to just stare in his eyes
[1:11:06] he's awesome
[1:11:08] think about this
[1:11:11] every generation
[1:11:13] has the supply of everything it needs
[1:11:17] to survive
[1:11:20] there are a certain number of doctors
[1:11:23] that are born every day to replace the
[1:11:26] ones
[1:11:28] that are now living
[1:11:30] there are a certain amount of musicians
[1:11:33] you know that's when people say you can
[1:11:35] be whatever you want to no you can't
[1:11:40] that's not true
[1:11:43] hallelujah you can only be what god has
[1:11:47] ordained you to be
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:52] is that right
[1:11:53] think about the people amen that what
[1:11:55] they could sing
[1:11:58] y'all know that's the truth
[1:12:01] and some people who think they can sing
[1:12:05] but that's a gift
[1:12:07] i didn't ask for it and those seekers
[1:12:10] that can't see they didn't ask for it
[1:12:13] we didn't have to work at it
[1:12:16] hallelujah think about the musicians
[1:12:21] you say oh i wish i was a musician
[1:12:23] that's about as far as it going to go
[1:12:26] if that if that gift is not there
[1:12:30] y'all understand me so you and i we must
[1:12:32] know understand that whatever we are
[1:12:35] ordained to
[1:12:37] be is what we're going to be
[1:12:40] there's no use or no need to get jealous
[1:12:43] of someone else
[1:12:46] you can do something they can't do
[1:12:48] and they can do something you can't do
[1:12:51] oh i think about all of the churches i
[1:12:53] said you know what that devil is a smart
[1:12:56] critter
[1:12:57] i said because if we could ever get on
[1:12:59] one accord
[1:13:01] we'll wipe his kingdom out within a
[1:13:03] second
[1:13:06] but he knows how to divide us
[1:13:08] and you know how he does it by jealousy
[1:13:14] it's all jealousy
[1:13:17] that's why we need the holy ghost
[1:13:20] that's why we need the power of god
[1:13:24] because wherever the spirit of the lord
[1:13:26] is there is liberty
[1:13:29] hallelujah and he whom the son set free
[1:13:32] is free indeed
[1:13:34] hallelujah
[1:13:36] is that right
[1:13:37] remember jesus disciples asked the
[1:13:40] question
[1:13:41] who's going to be the greatest
[1:13:43] and jesus said don't think like that
[1:13:46] that's how the heathens that's how the
[1:13:48] gentiles think
[1:13:50] hallelujah but i'll tell you the secret
[1:13:53] the greatest in my kingdom is the least
[1:14:00] is that right
[1:14:01] oh let's move on with this
[1:14:04] so you and i must understand that we're
[1:14:06] living
[1:14:07] in the age of the greatest mystery
[1:14:11] and that mystery is the coming of the
[1:14:13] lord
[1:14:14] oh come on somebody y'all got quiet on
[1:14:17] me that you see because then it's it's
[1:14:21] a mystery doesn't mean it remains a
[1:14:23] mystery
[1:14:25] a secret is not always a secret once
[1:14:28] it's told
[1:14:31] hallelujah
[1:14:33] but this is why it's so important
[1:14:36] to be in the spirit
[1:14:38] because it's in the spirit
[1:14:40] is when you receive things from the lord
[1:14:44] is that right i was thinking of this the
[1:14:46] other day and i've tyler told his
[1:14:48] testimony before amen y'all know about
[1:14:51] the life magazine and the cloud and all
[1:14:53] these things and i can remember the time
[1:14:55] when this white man came to the
[1:14:56] neighborhood and he was showing me this
[1:14:59] cloud or this thing that was happening
[1:15:01] in the night magazine and he opened it
[1:15:03] up he says the lord is soon to come he
[1:15:06] said
[1:15:07] can you see the face of jesus
[1:15:10] and none of the other boys could see it
[1:15:13] but when i saw it
[1:15:16] you know what he did he shut the book
[1:15:19] and walked away
[1:15:21] and i never seen that book again until i
[1:15:25] came to this message
[1:15:28] how many of y'all remember that one song
[1:15:29] that god gave me
[1:15:33] i'm gonna sing it at the end
[1:15:35] yes
[1:15:37] he descended in a cloud
[1:15:39] he gave his word with a shout
[1:15:42] time will be
[1:15:44] when no will never be right we're living
[1:15:47] in eternity
[1:15:49] right he's the one
[1:15:51] that called us out of satan's system
[1:15:54] you know i'm saying this thing and you
[1:15:57] know it's just like what in the world
[1:16:00] now things are beginning to open up to
[1:16:03] me
[1:16:05] so you said well what do you mean
[1:16:06] brothers remember
[1:16:08] one thing jesus said to martha and mary
[1:16:10] he said i am
[1:16:13] the resurrection
[1:16:16] hallelujah and they says well lord we
[1:16:19] know in that day
[1:16:21] see when they wanted to put it off
[1:16:24] and here was a resurrection standing
[1:16:29] right in front of him
[1:16:31] here was the seventh seal
[1:16:34] talking them
[1:16:35] and they couldn't even recognize it
[1:16:39] and he said unto them
[1:16:42] roll away the stone
[1:16:44] if you want to see the resurrection
[1:16:48] if you want to see the son of man word
[1:16:51] come to pass
[1:16:52] roll away the stone of unbelief
[1:16:56] roll away the stone of your denomination
[1:16:59] roll away the stone of your organization
[1:17:02] and you're going to see
[1:17:04] a miracle
[1:17:07] y'all understand me
[1:17:08] see the thing about the resurrection is
[1:17:11] it's so
[1:17:14] mysterious
[1:17:16] but we make it more mysterious
[1:17:18] it's something that you have to have
[1:17:20] faith in
[1:17:23] huh
[1:17:25] even coming even being raised from the
[1:17:27] dead
[1:17:28] you have to have faith in god that it
[1:17:31] can be done
[1:17:34] hallelujah think about it
[1:17:36] talk about the resurrection now and we
[1:17:38] know the resurrection is not getting
[1:17:40] something new and bringing it back up
[1:17:43] it's actually taking the old that which
[1:17:46] went down and bringing it back up
[1:17:49] that's the day we're living in
[1:17:53] and the bible says and i'm my
[1:17:55] scripture's there but i'm gonna go head
[1:17:56] on the bible says that the dead in
[1:17:59] christ should rise first
[1:18:02] we didn't know what that was
[1:18:05] until jesus
[1:18:07] raised himself
[1:18:08] raised from the dead
[1:18:11] right and the bible says
[1:18:14] many of the saints that slept
[1:18:18] rose
[1:18:21] hallelujah and walked around the city
[1:18:25] see when jesus got up
[1:18:28] everything that belonged to him
[1:18:31] that was ordained to get up
[1:18:34] got up
[1:18:36] y'all understand me
[1:18:38] you said oh brother yes i understand i
[1:18:40] you know i've got the holy ghost don't
[1:18:42] you know what the holy ghost is
[1:18:45] let me say it like this do you know who
[1:18:48] the holy ghost is
[1:18:54] hallelujah that's why the devil don't
[1:18:55] want you to get it
[1:18:58] because he knows if you ever get the
[1:19:00] holy ghost his battles are over
[1:19:04] he can fight you as much as he possibly
[1:19:07] can but he can never stop the journey
[1:19:11] hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:19:13] this morning
[1:19:15] he said i'll never leave you
[1:19:17] nor will i forsake you
[1:19:19] now this can't hardly stand people i'm
[1:19:22] so bored
[1:19:23] bored
[1:19:26] you hadn't prayed in a while
[1:19:30] bored
[1:19:31] but ain't nobody loving me what
[1:19:35] how can that be
[1:19:38] jesus said i'll never leave you
[1:19:41] i never forsake you
[1:19:43] somehow you got amnesia
[1:19:46] you've forgotten who's with you and you
[1:19:49] have forgotten who's in you
[1:19:52] hallelujah he said i'll never leave you
[1:19:56] neither will i forsake you
[1:19:58] oh lord i just feel so alone that's the
[1:20:02] devil's lie
[1:20:05] hallelujah i'm coming
[1:20:07] so what happens
[1:20:10] jesus says
[1:20:11] if you really believe
[1:20:13] you'll see the resurrection
[1:20:16] because i am the resurrection
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:20] now you think about it
[1:20:22] he told them to roll away the stones
[1:20:26] i still wish i was dead
[1:20:29] i wish i could have seen those two women
[1:20:30] roll that big old stone away
[1:20:33] i don't know whether they got help the
[1:20:34] bible doesn't say
[1:20:36] it just said that they rolled the stone
[1:20:38] away
[1:20:39] y'all understand me
[1:20:41] they weren't bodybuilders
[1:20:43] they were real women
[1:20:47] [Laughter]
[1:20:49] hallelujah they were real
[1:20:52] sweet and soft
[1:20:54] do we have any of those kind left
[1:20:57] i know i've got one over there now
[1:21:00] i feel i really wish y'all could get a
[1:21:02] wife like mine
[1:21:07] hallelujah but she's mine you know
[1:21:11] so anyway when you look at these things
[1:21:13] and you say oh brothers what is wrong
[1:21:15] with you what i'm trying to say let me
[1:21:17] hurry up because i'm going too slow
[1:21:19] you need to see
[1:21:22] that the light that this holy spirit is
[1:21:24] to give you is to bring a change
[1:21:31] if you have not seen a change in your
[1:21:33] life since you have declared that you
[1:21:36] have the holy spirit something's wrong
[1:21:40] oh come on somebody
[1:21:43] she because the holy ghost is not just
[1:21:45] the holy ghost but the holy ghost is
[1:21:47] holy ghost and fire
[1:21:50] and when that fire comes in you it burns
[1:21:53] the desire of the world out of you
[1:21:57] hallelujah
[1:21:59] y'all hear me
[1:22:00] i remember when i first got saved and
[1:22:03] and one of my sisters and her boyfriend
[1:22:05] had that big old colt 45. see that was
[1:22:08] my drink
[1:22:12] yeah
[1:22:14] i partied and danced like everybody else
[1:22:17] y'all hear me
[1:22:18] everybody in the neighborhood knew where
[1:22:20] to come
[1:22:22] i was a weekend man
[1:22:25] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:22:27] but when god changed me
[1:22:30] let me tell you and when he changed let
[1:22:32] me say if he could change me he can
[1:22:35] change you i don't care who you are god
[1:22:38] can change you my family thought i had
[1:22:41] lost my mind
[1:22:44] put me to every test
[1:22:46] hallelujah
[1:22:48] hey
[1:22:49] that come right home from church and
[1:22:51] they had that big old coke 45 they're
[1:22:54] sweating
[1:22:59] i walked right by
[1:23:01] hallelujah why because when god took
[1:23:04] that from me he took it from me
[1:23:07] y'all understand me there's no desire he
[1:23:10] takes away the desire
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:16] hallelujah
[1:23:17] oh god help us here because jesus christ
[1:23:21] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:23:23] he's a god that changed not you know
[1:23:25] what i don't care if i don't get your
[1:23:28] amen i got the amen in me
[1:23:31] hallelujah you understand me we are in a
[1:23:34] time
[1:23:36] that we must understand
[1:23:38] that the seventh seal
[1:23:40] is what brought the rapture on
[1:23:43] i know some of y'all don't know what i'm
[1:23:44] talking about
[1:23:47] in the book of revelation
[1:23:49] the seventh seal was opened
[1:23:51] and his ears opened
[1:23:53] hallelujah it was the resurrection seal
[1:23:57] y'all hear it
[1:23:58] that's how come we know the rapture is
[1:24:00] right now
[1:24:02] and believe you or not it's happening
[1:24:05] right now why because god has called the
[1:24:08] people out of laodicea and he's changing
[1:24:10] them from glory to glory
[1:24:13] it's not that you're going to be
[1:24:14] partying and all of a sudden the snap of
[1:24:16] the a twinkling of the eye and you in
[1:24:18] heaven no sigh you got to prove yourself
[1:24:22] here
[1:24:25] oh it's the truth
[1:24:29] hallelujah
[1:24:31] that's why i was silenced in heaven
[1:24:34] because nobody knew how he was going to
[1:24:35] do it
[1:24:37] when he was going to do it
[1:24:38] even the prophet god didn't know
[1:24:43] jesus said at that time he didn't know
[1:24:48] hallelujah but it was in the father's
[1:24:51] hand
[1:24:52] now y'all think i'm preaching two gods
[1:24:54] and i'm not
[1:24:55] there's only one god and that god is the
[1:24:59] lord jesus christ
[1:25:01] hallelujah but if he want to be
[1:25:03] president
[1:25:04] he's a he can that's right
[1:25:06] if he want to be a secretary he can
[1:25:10] if he want to be a judge he can if he
[1:25:13] wants to be a jury he can
[1:25:16] why he's a god of him are they he's a
[1:25:18] god that changes his mask
[1:25:21] oh lord help me here so let me move on
[1:25:27] he rolled away the stone
[1:25:31] they rode away the stone
[1:25:34] and jesus
[1:25:35] is something about jesus
[1:25:38] you know when he calls your name
[1:25:41] nobody else may not hear it
[1:25:44] hallelujah oh come on brethren
[1:25:47] you know it
[1:25:48] it's something about the way your wife
[1:25:50] call your name
[1:25:53] she doesn't have to say what's your name
[1:25:58] and you know what the rest is
[1:26:01] it can be sweet
[1:26:03] and it can be unsweet
[1:26:07] but just in the way they call your name
[1:26:10] you know whether something's good gonna
[1:26:12] happen or something's bad
[1:26:16] like that likewise with a man y'all know
[1:26:19] what i'm saying but it's something about
[1:26:22] the name of jesus when jesus calls your
[1:26:25] name
[1:26:26] it gets your attention
[1:26:30] wait a minute brother rose yes
[1:26:33] i don't know
[1:26:35] there's no scientific explanation
[1:26:38] he was a dead man
[1:26:40] dead and rotted
[1:26:42] four days don't know where he journeyed
[1:26:46] to
[1:26:47] but when jesus called his name
[1:26:52] hallelujah
[1:26:54] the science
[1:26:55] the cosmos
[1:26:57] everything had to obey
[1:27:02] and everything began to restore
[1:27:05] y'all understand me there's something
[1:27:07] that's happening in the pride that's
[1:27:09] restoring
[1:27:11] even though you can't see it
[1:27:18] the story
[1:27:20] when when lazarus come hopping out of
[1:27:23] that
[1:27:25] grave
[1:27:28] all jesus could say is loose the man
[1:27:31] and let him go
[1:27:32] because see once
[1:27:35] the word of god catches you
[1:27:38] by calling your name
[1:27:40] there's got to be somebody a ministry
[1:27:43] that can remove the grave clothes
[1:27:47] huh
[1:27:48] because what you don't understand amen
[1:27:50] that these organizations and nominations
[1:27:52] and things of that nature let me tell
[1:27:54] you something there are christians in
[1:27:55] all of them don't get me wrong but there
[1:27:58] are those who are wearing gray clothes
[1:28:00] and they don't even do it
[1:28:04] hallelujah
[1:28:06] but the message will cause those grave
[1:28:09] clothes to be taken away from you
[1:28:12] why because we're not living in a day of
[1:28:14] touch not taste not hand or not
[1:28:18] we're living in the day of election
[1:28:20] we're living in the day of god chose me
[1:28:23] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:28:25] world we're living in a day a
[1:28:28] predestination
[1:28:29] we have been predestinated here by his
[1:28:33] foreknowledge to do what live the world
[1:28:38] let me hurry
[1:28:40] by god's grace
[1:28:42] you love the lord
[1:28:44] hallelujah we
[1:28:45] we must understand
[1:28:47] like i said
[1:28:49] god in every type of the word
[1:28:51] every type
[1:28:52] is explaining and bringing revelation to
[1:28:55] us
[1:28:56] you know we saw those stories as stories
[1:28:58] right right we thought it was such good
[1:29:00] stories
[1:29:01] right you know we saw samson and and all
[1:29:04] he did and we thought wow that's
[1:29:05] wonderful
[1:29:06] but samson
[1:29:08] was a story of prophecy
[1:29:11] he was a character that god used
[1:29:14] to prophesy what was going to happen in
[1:29:17] this day
[1:29:18] y'all hear me
[1:29:19] in in samson we saw amen how samson was
[1:29:23] chosen he was what a nazirite
[1:29:26] and what is the bride a nazirite
[1:29:29] he was a nazarite
[1:29:32] he was ordained to do the will of god
[1:29:35] and his purpose was to kill the
[1:29:37] philistines
[1:29:39] hallelujah
[1:29:41] but just like some of us
[1:29:43] we go in our power and our strength how
[1:29:45] many y'all remember when you first got
[1:29:46] saved
[1:29:47] you could move mountains
[1:29:50] right the miracles the things that god
[1:29:52] would do for you amen you couldn't help
[1:29:54] but to tell it
[1:29:55] but guess what delilah started wooing
[1:29:58] you
[1:30:01] right the world started wooing you and
[1:30:03] all of a sudden your attraction to her
[1:30:07] made you lose the attraction from the
[1:30:10] purpose for which you were born
[1:30:13] help us somebody see the pride of jesus
[1:30:15] christ you're the light of the world
[1:30:21] oh
[1:30:22] that means wherever you go
[1:30:24] people should see who jesus is
[1:30:28] oh help us lord is this okay
[1:30:31] because i want you to understand the
[1:30:33] resurrection is on i haven't got to the
[1:30:34] way i'm going but i want you to
[1:30:36] understand all of these shadows and
[1:30:37] types
[1:30:39] because he was
[1:30:43] he was already blinded now
[1:30:45] then got caught by delilah
[1:30:48] the mystery of the seven thunders is
[1:30:50] gone
[1:30:52] the seven seals is gone
[1:30:54] right
[1:30:55] the hair was gone
[1:30:58] but the root was still there
[1:31:01] hallelujah
[1:31:02] is that right that's what makes you
[1:31:05] different
[1:31:06] because you're the seed with the root
[1:31:09] hallelujah
[1:31:11] that's what the bible says
[1:31:13] jesus was a root and offspring of david
[1:31:17] oh come on somebody and when you realize
[1:31:20] honey oh i love this i love this because
[1:31:23] i realize that nothing the devil can do
[1:31:26] to stop me
[1:31:28] nothing
[1:31:31] david amen i mean excuse yeah
[1:31:34] come to him and he's uh
[1:31:36] he remembers
[1:31:38] you know how bad it gets sometime
[1:31:42] we don't pray
[1:31:43] we don't study
[1:31:45] and that's why people can't rejoice when
[1:31:47] the word come
[1:31:48] because most of the time they don't
[1:31:49] study
[1:31:50] and they don't have well know what
[1:31:52] you're talking about
[1:31:56] especially when you preach it
[1:31:58] now if i taught it and gave you all the
[1:32:00] quotes and all the scriptures and you
[1:32:01] said why but you see
[1:32:03] you supposed to be the word by now
[1:32:08] huh
[1:32:09] that book you say i ate
[1:32:11] you become that book
[1:32:14] you understand me
[1:32:16] now the bible tells me that jesus he
[1:32:18] said he was a living waters and out of
[1:32:20] him he said it flowed living that's what
[1:32:23] he told the woman at the well
[1:32:25] if you take of me you'll never have to
[1:32:27] go to that denominational teachings
[1:32:29] anymore i'll give you rivers of waters
[1:32:32] that will flow up into eternal life
[1:32:38] i'm talking to everybody here who's
[1:32:40] married to a system
[1:32:44] you're supposed to be married to the
[1:32:45] world
[1:32:47] where brothers saw and saw a bishop
[1:32:49] so-and-so a deacon source or a pope so i
[1:32:51] don't care about stuff like that what'd
[1:32:53] the words say
[1:32:57] the word is your handship
[1:33:00] but let's go home i'm sorry
[1:33:02] but you look at this thing you say oh
[1:33:03] brother what are you saying here we come
[1:33:07] david this is the part i really like
[1:33:10] he said maybe there's a possibility
[1:33:16] there's a possibility that god will hear
[1:33:17] my prayer again
[1:33:19] y'all know what i'm saying how many
[1:33:21] you've done wrong so much and haven't
[1:33:22] felt god in such a long time to the
[1:33:24] devil tell you or you don't cross the
[1:33:26] line
[1:33:27] the devil is such a liar
[1:33:30] he's a liar
[1:33:32] as long as you have a desire to serve
[1:33:35] god god is still there
[1:33:39] he's still there
[1:33:44] i don't care how wretched you've been i
[1:33:46] don't care where how glow you going
[1:33:49] you're the kind god enough to raise up
[1:33:54] god don't come for the goody goods
[1:33:56] god comes for the trash
[1:33:59] he comes for the man and the woman who
[1:34:01] know they need salvation
[1:34:05] is that right he don't come to the
[1:34:07] religious kind because the religious
[1:34:09] kind feel like they don't need him
[1:34:12] but let me tell you something i need him
[1:34:15] i need him every day every hour every
[1:34:18] moment of the day i need him
[1:34:21] hallelujah
[1:34:24] and here he's david says well
[1:34:26] uh
[1:34:27] samson excuse me says maybe there's a
[1:34:29] possibility
[1:34:31] i love that
[1:34:32] that means it's possible
[1:34:36] and what do you got to lose
[1:34:39] right
[1:34:40] take hold of the possibility
[1:34:42] it says lord
[1:34:44] have mercy
[1:34:46] and do it for me one more time
[1:34:49] lord i need a revive out
[1:34:52] it's been a long time since i felt your
[1:34:55] presence
[1:34:56] it's been a long time since i prayed an
[1:34:59] hour
[1:35:00] come on somebody y'all know how it is
[1:35:03] it's gotten so difficult now you can
[1:35:05] barely pray 15 minutes hallelujah but
[1:35:09] god is a god of restoration
[1:35:16] hallelujah if i was you i wouldn't leave
[1:35:18] out here without god touching me
[1:35:21] oh
[1:35:23] i take that possibility and i run with
[1:35:26] it
[1:35:27] i don't have to feel it
[1:35:29] the feeling comes later
[1:35:32] hallelujah
[1:35:34] yes lord
[1:35:36] he said oh lord once more
[1:35:39] people say well oh he was talking to the
[1:35:41] nomination no he wasn't
[1:35:43] not in the message i'm talking about
[1:35:45] he was already kicked out of the
[1:35:46] nomination jesus christ was hallelujah
[1:35:51] when he said once more lord
[1:35:54] that means this old bride who he claimed
[1:35:56] to be bride was going to fall into a
[1:35:59] situation where she was going to have to
[1:36:01] cry oh lord once more
[1:36:05] that's what brother jackson were talking
[1:36:06] about
[1:36:07] talking about the glory of god
[1:36:09] you understand me
[1:36:11] the glory of god is god in you
[1:36:15] hallelujah
[1:36:17] it is just not enough to see it
[1:36:18] glorified in somebody else
[1:36:24] saint john 17.
[1:36:26] father the glory that you and i had
[1:36:28] together
[1:36:29] from the beginning i want them to have
[1:36:31] it
[1:36:32] who
[1:36:33] jesus
[1:36:37] i don't know about y'all but i i'm not
[1:36:38] gonna settle for what i uh uh i've seen
[1:36:41] religion too long
[1:36:44] everybody won't be i don't want religion
[1:36:47] i can't stand it
[1:36:50] i can't stand even when people act like
[1:36:52] they holding and then the moment you
[1:36:53] cross them they biting your head off
[1:36:57] something wrong with your holy ghost
[1:37:02] oh it's true
[1:37:04] yes you still got a temper
[1:37:07] you still got to pray
[1:37:11] that's got to go
[1:37:13] y'all understand me
[1:37:15] oh i hate oh i gotta i you know yeah
[1:37:18] yeah
[1:37:19] you know how people say oh i forgave him
[1:37:21] but i don't care if i ever see him again
[1:37:26] the devil just lied to you
[1:37:28] you still got a problem
[1:37:31] and can i say it like this no unclean
[1:37:34] thing
[1:37:34] i don't care if you got demons you say
[1:37:36] oh i've been baptizing the name of these
[1:37:37] guys and i've been filled with the holy
[1:37:39] ghost and you got demons
[1:37:41] hanging on you you need to get them off
[1:37:45] yeah oh my
[1:37:46] god no unclean thing is going to enter
[1:37:50] into that city
[1:37:53] that's why he said only going to be a
[1:37:54] few
[1:37:56] that's making it
[1:37:58] you know why because your religion has
[1:38:00] told you that you're okay that way
[1:38:02] because grace is sufficient
[1:38:05] god is calling for perfection
[1:38:08] and if the blood of jesus christ cannot
[1:38:10] destroy the devils in your life that
[1:38:13] same blood is not qualified to save you
[1:38:20] help us jesus
[1:38:22] you say he washes away all my sins
[1:38:25] that's exactly what he does
[1:38:27] and the holy ghost will burn every devil
[1:38:30] away from your soul
[1:38:33] i'm not saying that you'll never be
[1:38:35] tempted
[1:38:36] but understand whenever you are tempted
[1:38:38] the bible says you are drawn away with
[1:38:40] your own lust
[1:38:42] god didn't do that your lust did it you
[1:38:44] still got darkness that need to be
[1:38:46] getting gotten rid of
[1:38:48] oh god help us jesus
[1:38:51] let me hurry up by god's grace
[1:38:55] hallelujah
[1:38:59] god come down and and give goliath
[1:39:03] excuse me david
[1:39:04] samson
[1:39:06] i'm coming
[1:39:08] samson
[1:39:09] one more chance
[1:39:11] and guess what
[1:39:13] he's in the book
[1:39:14] the hall of fame
[1:39:16] according to hebrew
[1:39:18] god don't even talk about what he did
[1:39:21] he just talks about the victory
[1:39:24] you understand me you say well how can
[1:39:26] he doesn't do that because the blood of
[1:39:28] jesus christ washes it
[1:39:30] cleanses it
[1:39:32] it takes it back to wherever it was
[1:39:33] before it got here
[1:39:35] is that right the bible said abraham
[1:39:38] never staggered
[1:39:41] that used to make me stagger
[1:39:45] yeah
[1:39:46] because i know what abraham did it's
[1:39:48] written what abraham did he wasn't so
[1:39:51] obedient
[1:39:53] in the natural
[1:39:55] but what we failed to see is that god
[1:39:57] gave him an unconditional covenant
[1:40:01] hallelujah
[1:40:02] and who god justify is justified
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:08] and god said as he did and judge abraham
[1:40:11] he judges abraham see just a lie
[1:40:14] let me hurry let me hurry i really
[1:40:17] appreciate your patience
[1:40:20] so amen you understand
[1:40:22] that where we are
[1:40:24] we are in a time of the resurrection
[1:40:28] remember the story
[1:40:33] remember the story
[1:40:38] when there were two women
[1:40:41] and it came to solomon y'all remember
[1:40:44] that story
[1:40:45] both of them had babies at the same time
[1:40:47] and those babies types out like revival
[1:40:51] but this one revival died the baby died
[1:40:55] and this this this woman tried to claim
[1:40:58] the others
[1:40:59] baby
[1:41:00] right right
[1:41:02] and and and and and solomon they went
[1:41:04] before solomon who was the judge
[1:41:07] solomon being a prophet
[1:41:09] he said
[1:41:10] bring me the baby
[1:41:13] since y'all gonna argue about it
[1:41:16] see that's what it is you know
[1:41:17] denominationals and like i said like
[1:41:19] this a lot of people don't care to have
[1:41:20] a halfway revival
[1:41:23] you know you feel good
[1:41:25] that's all
[1:41:26] no i come to revivals to be changed
[1:41:30] why do you go to church to be changed
[1:41:33] i want the washing of the water of the
[1:41:35] word i want it to change me
[1:41:38] that's why i go
[1:41:40] that's why i come to hear the word
[1:41:41] that's why i read the word i read the
[1:41:44] word so i can become the words
[1:41:48] right so anyway this other one says no
[1:41:51] uh yes
[1:41:53] kill it
[1:41:54] give her half and give me half
[1:41:57] but the real mom says nah
[1:41:59] you see i don't want half of the word
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:04] i want it all
[1:42:07] i want i don't want a dead letter
[1:42:09] i want something living
[1:42:12] y'all understand me i don't want half of
[1:42:15] it the bride don't want half of the
[1:42:16] message she don't want half of the
[1:42:18] revival she wants a whole revival
[1:42:22] that's where we are this
[1:42:26] yes morning
[1:42:28] i didn't come here to be a theologian
[1:42:31] i didn't come here just to be a
[1:42:32] christian
[1:42:33] i'm i'm beyond that
[1:42:36] i come here by god's grace amen to do
[1:42:38] what to be the bride of jesus hallelujah
[1:42:43] and this is what god wants he wants us
[1:42:45] to be the bride
[1:42:48] and it cannot come back void
[1:42:51] is that right
[1:42:52] i'm sorry i preached so long but let me
[1:42:54] just finish up quickly
[1:42:57] you and i must understand
[1:42:59] that the satan wants to destroy you
[1:43:02] he wants to destroy you
[1:43:04] now you know i know you're hot i'm hot
[1:43:06] too but let me say it like this
[1:43:09] you see
[1:43:10] sometimes it takes a long time
[1:43:12] for people to realize they're true sons
[1:43:14] and daughters of god
[1:43:17] but when it happens
[1:43:19] nothing can change
[1:43:22] and i'd rather see somebody you know all
[1:43:25] of a sudden
[1:43:26] 20 years or 30 years all of a sudden the
[1:43:28] light switches on
[1:43:30] you know what happens they get they get
[1:43:32] revengeful
[1:43:34] they they they want to to to uh
[1:43:38] redeem the time
[1:43:41] and they can become some of the greatest
[1:43:42] witnesses
[1:43:44] ever
[1:43:46] but the bible says you need to take heed
[1:43:49] to yourself
[1:43:51] let's at any time
[1:43:53] your heart
[1:43:55] be overcharged with suffering
[1:43:58] and that's the excess
[1:44:00] you know i gotta have more
[1:44:02] i i you know i just can't just work the
[1:44:05] normal time i gotta have overtime
[1:44:07] because i want over
[1:44:11] and then chess i gotta do this i gotta
[1:44:13] do that i gotta and see that's what
[1:44:15] happens
[1:44:16] you know the devil is smart
[1:44:18] he gives you we know about the tv and
[1:44:20] all of those things so he gives you a
[1:44:22] phone
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:25] don't tell y'all know it
[1:44:27] the phone has become your god
[1:44:29] you hear the little d
[1:44:32] you wake up you answer it
[1:44:35] god say get up and pray
[1:44:38] you say five more minutes
[1:44:41] right
[1:44:42] that's the way we do god
[1:44:45] okay
[1:44:46] don't look at me like i'm crazy
[1:44:50] it's true
[1:44:51] that same thing with become will become
[1:44:54] a snare to you
[1:44:57] yes it will
[1:44:58] it's a trap
[1:45:00] it's to keep you from being consecrated
[1:45:03] it's a it's a thing that y'all know i
[1:45:06] hate the phone
[1:45:07] but at the same time you got to use it
[1:45:09] for business
[1:45:11] right
[1:45:12] there was a time amen that we used to
[1:45:14] have those phones and we had the message
[1:45:16] those machines
[1:45:18] people that leave the message on the
[1:45:19] machine
[1:45:20] as soon as the machine would cut on
[1:45:22] they would hang up
[1:45:25] they don't do that with the iphone
[1:45:29] no they gonna leave you a message
[1:45:32] and if they can't
[1:45:33] give you the voicemail they're gonna
[1:45:35] text it
[1:45:38] what is it the devil consuming our time
[1:45:43] it's the truth
[1:45:45] i don't know about facebook i'm not on
[1:45:47] there i don't condemn a lot you know
[1:45:48] everything is good and evil
[1:45:50] it's what you do with it
[1:45:52] but i find out that a lot of people
[1:45:53] don't do the right thing
[1:45:56] hallelujah and then you worry about the
[1:45:59] government with instruments in your
[1:46:01] house and you got facebook and you're
[1:46:02] telling it all right
[1:46:06] it makes no sense to me
[1:46:09] y'all understand me
[1:46:11] we are holy people
[1:46:13] if we're going to have a facebook let's
[1:46:15] face the book
[1:46:19] [Applause]
[1:46:21] let's tell it to jesus he's the one that
[1:46:23] can heal us he's the one that can
[1:46:25] deliver us he's the one that saves us
[1:46:31] hallelujah
[1:46:32] i didn't get a chance to go even where i
[1:46:34] wanted to go but nevertheless i want you
[1:46:36] to understand
[1:46:39] when god opened that seventh seal and
[1:46:41] those same angels come out of heaven and
[1:46:43] god put i know y'all have a problem with
[1:46:45] the crowd but the bible says he will
[1:46:47] appear to those who love his appearing
[1:46:51] you missed that you missed the rapture
[1:46:54] and i'm just going to voice this out
[1:46:55] because of my time
[1:46:58] but when jesus died
[1:47:00] and when he rose again from the dead
[1:47:03] the bible said that the saints
[1:47:06] rose with it right
[1:47:08] is that right i want you to think about
[1:47:10] mount transfiguration
[1:47:12] because mount transfiguration was a
[1:47:14] prelude
[1:47:15] to the rapture
[1:47:17] and there stood moses and elijah there
[1:47:19] that right
[1:47:21] all right
[1:47:22] so even at the grave site
[1:47:24] when jesus rose from the dead
[1:47:27] no no wrong nobody could roll that stone
[1:47:30] away
[1:47:31] that seal had to be broken
[1:47:33] by god himself why because he was that
[1:47:37] seventh seed
[1:47:39] y'all understand me he's the one he
[1:47:42] broke the seal
[1:47:44] hallelujah
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:47] then as i said at the gravesite mary
[1:47:49] then all looking in there
[1:47:51] he says
[1:47:52] why do you seek the living
[1:47:54] among the dead
[1:47:56] hallelujah here he goes again
[1:47:59] here's the seventh seal here's jesus
[1:48:02] talking
[1:48:04] and and he's acting
[1:48:06] like a gardener at least that's what she
[1:48:08] thought he was
[1:48:10] and she turned because now she's looking
[1:48:12] into the grave she's looking into the
[1:48:14] tomb and she sees moses and elijah y'all
[1:48:17] something's being said
[1:48:20] hallelujah that's that wasn't where the
[1:48:22] light was
[1:48:25] the life had been resurrected
[1:48:28] then she turned and she saw a garden
[1:48:31] that the resurrection is over
[1:48:33] the resurrection is on and everybody
[1:48:36] that went to the tomb did not see jesus
[1:48:40] hallelujah but you see god gave her eyes
[1:48:44] to see i believe it's that mary
[1:48:46] who had seven demons who typed out the
[1:48:49] bride of jesus christ in seven church
[1:48:52] ages
[1:48:54] hallelujah she stood there
[1:48:56] she says revenue
[1:49:02] where did you lay him
[1:49:04] where is he
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:06] and all he had to do was say
[1:49:09] mary
[1:49:13] something about that voice
[1:49:15] you see that's how the message call you
[1:49:19] when you hear it
[1:49:21] you may not hear your name isaiah or
[1:49:24] john or james
[1:49:26] but something in you that makes you know
[1:49:29] it's right
[1:49:31] something makes you want to follow it
[1:49:34] you can't even explain it
[1:49:37] hallelujah you say what brother brooks
[1:49:39] what are you saying think about it
[1:49:41] those peter james john and all of those
[1:49:43] who were fishing and jesus said come
[1:49:45] follow me
[1:49:46] quit their jobs left their families
[1:49:49] didn't even have an explanation and here
[1:49:52] was jesus
[1:49:53] who said foxes have holes birds have
[1:49:56] nests but i have no place to lay my head
[1:49:59] but yet these men followed him
[1:50:02] y'all understand me it's a predestinated
[1:50:05] situation
[1:50:07] it's an election situation we can't
[1:50:09] explain it
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:12] hallelujah you understand what i'm
[1:50:14] saying when god calls you you've got to
[1:50:17] go
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:19] that's the way it was with your
[1:50:20] salvation
[1:50:22] they call me crazy boy you crazy
[1:50:24] you could have been this you could have
[1:50:25] been that
[1:50:26] no
[1:50:27] i could not have been
[1:50:29] i'm exactly what god wants me to be
[1:50:32] so let's move on by god's grace and i'm
[1:50:33] almost done
[1:50:37] she saw the resurrection
[1:50:40] on the road to emmaus
[1:50:43] this is the message people
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:48] but here was
[1:50:50] two disciples walking down till they
[1:50:51] rolled him on the road emails
[1:50:55] and here come a stranger
[1:50:57] see i love god
[1:50:59] the bible said he knows them that are
[1:51:01] his
[1:51:03] hallelujah
[1:51:04] you know when you were in that system
[1:51:06] something was telling you something's
[1:51:08] wrong
[1:51:09] you know what the devil told you that
[1:51:13] that wasn't the devil
[1:51:15] something was telling you something
[1:51:16] right
[1:51:18] and then something would make you look
[1:51:21] at the word and look at what the people
[1:51:23] were doing he says
[1:51:25] don't measure out
[1:51:27] you know the devil didn't tell you that
[1:51:30] that was him
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:32] you didn't see him
[1:51:34] no more than rebecca saw him
[1:51:37] when rebecca was at that well
[1:51:39] perhaps a half hour
[1:51:42] before eliezer got there
[1:51:50] some inspiration told her
[1:51:52] there's coming some man
[1:51:54] and he's going to want you to water his
[1:51:56] men
[1:51:58] y'all understand me
[1:52:00] but
[1:52:01] in return don't just give the man water
[1:52:05] give his camels water too
[1:52:07] see you understand what i'm saying
[1:52:10] this message is not just written
[1:52:14] but it's revelation
[1:52:17] that the bride catches
[1:52:20] is what the prophet god said reading
[1:52:22] between the lies
[1:52:24] you know you you respond to what's in
[1:52:28] you and that's what people don't
[1:52:29] understand
[1:52:30] when god said eat the word
[1:52:34] you became those seven thunders
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:38] oh yes sir see i know you don't know
[1:52:40] what i'm talking about
[1:52:41] but it's the life of christ living
[1:52:43] itself
[1:52:46] seven thunders is not a thing
[1:52:48] it's a person
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:52] it's the nature of christ in you
[1:52:55] hallelujah
[1:52:57] and just closing
[1:53:00] i know you're tired
[1:53:02] but just closing
[1:53:05] looking back and
[1:53:07] seeing what malachi 4 did
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:10] it's wonderful
[1:53:13] i see what moses did
[1:53:15] i've seen what david has done
[1:53:18] solomon all of them but this is your day
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:24] hallelujah is not enough
[1:53:27] to say our message
[1:53:29] you must be vindicated
[1:53:32] and it's not by the knowledge you know
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:37] it's about the quality of christ
[1:53:40] it's the christ that's in you that will
[1:53:43] vindicate you
[1:53:46] y'all know what i'm saying
[1:53:48] remember that woman amen that was out
[1:53:50] south there and she was waiting waiting
[1:53:56] because she had prayed all night she had
[1:53:58] a son that was sick
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:03] god said i'm sending you elijah
[1:54:06] she prayed
[1:54:08] and the holy spirit nothing written
[1:54:10] nothing written nothing written summer
[1:54:13] she she seen a vision a dream whatever
[1:54:15] it was but the inspiration she stood
[1:54:17] there
[1:54:18] on the fence waiting for elijah
[1:54:21] you understand me
[1:54:23] she was some unwritten word
[1:54:26] standing there but now she's written
[1:54:30] hallelujah
[1:54:31] she's standing there waiting and then
[1:54:33] when he showed up says
[1:54:35] howdy parson
[1:54:37] how do you know i'm a person amen
[1:54:40] god doesn't show me
[1:54:43] have you ever heard of elijah knew
[1:54:46] but i'm kind of i'm not like that
[1:54:47] shooting my woman
[1:54:49] god gave me a son and he he went out and
[1:54:51] he had a social uh disease and now he's
[1:54:54] dying
[1:54:55] she didn't even care whether he got
[1:54:57] healed or not she just didn't want him
[1:54:59] so lost
[1:55:01] that's the way i feel about my children
[1:55:04] ah i want to see them say
[1:55:06] no matter what the cost
[1:55:09] see y'all got quiet
[1:55:11] because you don't know eternal life is
[1:55:13] far better than this little time vapor
[1:55:18] oh my god
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:21] in closing
[1:55:26] that woman was in the land of goliath
[1:55:30] and she didn't even know about elijah
[1:55:33] until he showed up
[1:55:35] you understand me
[1:55:37] he said you he said
[1:55:39] her prayer causes goosebumps my hair to
[1:55:42] stand up on my head
[1:55:44] you can tell she
[1:55:47] had talked to god
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:51] see it get rid of your these
[1:55:52] denominational issues
[1:55:55] if god people weren't in there he would
[1:55:57] never tell him to come out of
[1:56:00] [Music]
[1:56:03] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:56:05] we are the bride
[1:56:07] we are the light of the world we have
[1:56:09] the commission amen to bring them out
[1:56:14] like like
[1:56:16] like david man
[1:56:19] made saul men
[1:56:22] come into davis kingdom
[1:56:24] and that's where we are
[1:56:26] resurrection must be seen in you
[1:56:30] not just your praise not just your
[1:56:31] thanksgiving everybody can do that and
[1:56:33] god said if you refuse to do that he can
[1:56:35] get the rocks to do it
[1:56:38] but there's got to be a life
[1:56:41] people of god i just want to say it's an
[1:56:42] urgent time
[1:56:44] we have been slack we've been slow
[1:56:48] we haven't been reading and studying so
[1:56:49] my brother will tell you know i i don't
[1:56:51] know but that's what the spirit of god
[1:56:53] is telling me
[1:56:54] and if he's saying it it's true
[1:56:56] [Music]
[1:56:58] this is the time ever
[1:57:00] to pray like you've never prayed before
[1:57:03] i didn't read all the scriptures but
[1:57:05] that god would cause you to escape
[1:57:08] he would count you worthy to escape
[1:57:10] nobody wants to go to hell
[1:57:12] and nobody want to be left behind you
[1:57:15] have no idea
[1:57:17] what it's going to be like
[1:57:18] think about the people of pompeii
[1:57:21] what happened to them you know they had
[1:57:22] a voice you know somebody had to tell
[1:57:25] them
[1:57:26] because god judgment comes warning comes
[1:57:28] before judgment
[1:57:30] hallelujah like in the days of noah they
[1:57:32] were told
[1:57:33] in the days of sodom they were told
[1:57:36] in the days of capernaum
[1:57:38] they were told
[1:57:40] but because they ignored the warning
[1:57:44] hallelujah
[1:57:45] but you remember when titus came through
[1:57:48] jerusalem
[1:57:49] there were those who heard jesus and
[1:57:51] they got out of the city
[1:57:53] but everybody that didn't get out of the
[1:57:54] city
[1:57:57] had to face the wrath of god by way of
[1:57:59] titus
[1:58:01] and the in the history tell us that it
[1:58:03] got so bad
[1:58:05] that the people in jerusalem was eating
[1:58:07] bark off the tree
[1:58:09] and when they couldn't do that they
[1:58:10] began to eat their children
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:14] so america
[1:58:16] and the world
[1:58:17] is now coming into that place
[1:58:20] where you're gonna have food shortages
[1:58:22] and everything else y'all understand
[1:58:23] what i'm saying
[1:58:25] you're gonna need faith if you ain't got
[1:58:26] it now
[1:58:28] hallelujah
[1:58:30] right now to prepare yourself for what's
[1:58:32] to come
[1:58:34] we don't know how long the bride is
[1:58:35] going to be here before it all
[1:58:37] i i see things but i'm saying as a whole
[1:58:42] we must make ourselves greater now
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:47] is it that's little song
[1:58:52] i was lost
[1:58:55] contrary to god's word
[1:59:02] but by his grace
[1:59:05] i heard the
[1:59:07] spoken word
[1:59:12] it quickened my soul and it gave
[1:59:16] [Music]
[1:59:23] he's the one
[1:59:26] that called me out of satan's
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:42] he's the one
[1:59:47] time no more will never be
[1:59:52] living in eternity
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:08] he's the one
[2:00:11] that gave his work with a child
[2:00:17] he quickened my soul and he gave me
[2:00:20] eternal life
[2:00:27] he's the one
[2:00:29] that called me out of state of system
[2:00:35] he's the one
[2:00:38] saying
[2:00:40] [Music]
[2:00:47] [Music]
[2:00:50] i just can't remember it the way it was
[2:00:53] but that was the essence of it
[2:00:56] i thank god for
[2:00:58] his goodness
[2:01:01] i thank god for allowing us to be here
[2:01:03] tonight
[2:01:06] if there'd be any questions anything
[2:01:08] that i said i'd be more than
[2:01:10] happy to
[2:01:12] explain it
[2:01:13] or tell it
[2:01:15] i know we have a
[2:01:17] different people here this morning
[2:01:20] but i'm gonna tell you something
[2:01:23] i gave the best of my years
[2:01:26] to a system
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:31] a system of laws and rules
[2:01:35] oh yeah we had the shout we had the
[2:01:37] dance it was wonderful
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:41] but in
[2:01:42] years time
[2:01:44] i began to lose
[2:01:48] i i found out that the shouting wasn't
[2:01:50] good
[2:01:51] sufficient enough
[2:01:56] even i spoke in tongues and you know
[2:01:58] god
[2:02:00] bless me with a little gift of
[2:02:01] interpretation
[2:02:03] but i found out that when i needed
[2:02:04] strength
[2:02:07] that wasn't good
[2:02:09] that didn't hold
[2:02:10] yeah y'all hear what i'm saying
[2:02:13] oh there was nobody who could dance like
[2:02:15] me matter of fact
[2:02:16] [Music]
[2:02:18] the funny part about this is that
[2:02:20] i danced when i was in the methodist
[2:02:23] church
[2:02:25] the only church i didn't dance in was
[2:02:27] the catholic
[2:02:30] danced in the
[2:02:31] apostolic church i hope this is okay
[2:02:35] i'm not trying to hurt anybody but i
[2:02:36] want you to search yourself
[2:02:38] i want you to look deep in your hearts
[2:02:40] and your mind and says lord
[2:02:41] if we're supposed to be the word and
[2:02:44] these things are supposed to be
[2:02:45] happening to us all the day i have
[2:02:46] miracles every day
[2:02:48] something god shows me
[2:02:50] that's not natural but supernatural
[2:02:53] almost every time all the time so what
[2:02:55] i'm trying to say is that if god is in
[2:02:57] me
[2:02:58] why why i can't love like i shouldn't
[2:03:01] why do i let these things bother me the
[2:03:03] way they do it lord when when fear why
[2:03:07] how come fear overtake me when those
[2:03:09] saints of old that had the genuine holy
[2:03:11] ghost didn't even fear the lions
[2:03:16] same holy ghost right
[2:03:20] searching your heart
[2:03:22] i believe brother simmons is a true man
[2:03:24] of god
[2:03:26] i know he is i don't have to believe
[2:03:27] that
[2:03:29] and i know one thing for certain he he
[2:03:31] has
[2:03:32] done a great work on earth here i i've
[2:03:34] i've seen his work i've seen what god
[2:03:36] has done through it or not i'm not
[2:03:37] boasting a man i'm saying what i'm
[2:03:39] seeing god do
[2:03:40] in him
[2:03:42] and to do what he's doing now that
[2:03:44] that's god because a lot of people would
[2:03:46] not have it
[2:03:48] but he's being led by god and all of us
[2:03:50] are here
[2:03:51] and why are we here
[2:03:54] not just to have a good time
[2:03:56] this is the age of the rapture this is a
[2:03:58] time to change this is the time for
[2:04:00] christ that you and i grow up into him
[2:04:03] this is what he wants
[2:04:06] if i were you
[2:04:08] i wouldn't let these moments pass me by
[2:04:11] but he's talking about my church no
[2:04:14] i'm talking about everybody's church
[2:04:17] because church is not the thing that
[2:04:18] saves you
[2:04:20] only jesus christ in the blood of the
[2:04:22] lamb
[2:04:23] you love the lord
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:29] how
[2:04:31] we'll let you go after this song
[2:04:34] can i say thanks
[2:04:37] for the things
[2:04:40] you've done for me
[2:04:44] things
[2:04:47] so undeserved
[2:04:49] [Music]
[2:04:51] yet you get
[2:04:53] to prove your love to me
[2:04:58] the voices
[2:05:01] of a million angels
[2:05:05] cannot express
[2:05:08] my gratitude
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:12] all that i am
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:16] and ever hope to be
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:27] to
[2:05:28] god
[2:05:31] be the
[2:05:32] glory
[2:05:34] let us
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:51] [Music]
[2:06:00] just let me live
[2:06:04] my life
[2:06:06] and let it be pleasing
[2:06:10] lord today
[2:06:14] and if should i gain
[2:06:18] any praise
[2:06:21] let it flow together
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:42] he
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:07:02] oh
[2:07:06] be the glory
[2:07:11] to god
[2:07:14] be the glory
[2:07:19] to god
[2:07:22] be the glory
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:38] always remember god interprets his own
[2:07:40] word
[2:07:42] and when god interprets his word
[2:07:45] it's not always the way you think it's
[2:07:47] going to be
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:49] that's just the way
[2:07:51] god has always been
[2:07:54] they needed a savior
[2:07:55] he sent them jesus
[2:07:57] a baby in a manger
[2:08:00] they couldn't accept it
[2:08:02] but that was god's interpretation
[2:08:05] of isaiah's prophecy
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:17] praise god god is good amen
[2:08:22] we appreciate the word we appreciate
[2:08:23] brother brooks in the slave of love
[2:08:26] praise god
[2:08:28] we know sometimes when it comes down to
[2:08:30] the end folks get a little tired a
[2:08:32] little weak
[2:08:33] but i thank
[2:08:34] god him and allowing the lord to use him
[2:08:38] thank god for everyone the pressure way
[2:08:42] the brothers that worked so diligent and
