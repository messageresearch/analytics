[Music] And he says, "And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the keys of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be fulfilled. And after that, he must be loosed for a little season. And I saw thrones, and they that sat on them, and judgment was given unto them. And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection. On such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years. God bless the word. You may be seated. Now we want to talk about the king the kingdom age of the time of the millennium the 1,000 years. Amen. The Bible tells us in Jude the one day is with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years is as one day. Now we know Jesus comes in three sons. Son of man, son of God and son of David. in the son of David with Solomon that speaks of the millennium reign. And then we talked about the millennial r millennium reign the thousand years. We talk about the kingdom age because no doubt Pilot wrote over his head a accusation Jesus king of the Jews because they they looked for him. And the Jews were looking for a king, but yet he came as a servant. Amen. He came as a sacrifice to die on the cross, but they were looking and usually uh man is are looking for something to be in the future or something to be in the past. He always get it wrong. Amen. And that which God promised in his word and which stand before them, they can't see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. except God opened our eyes, you know, and I I I was talking to some individuals today and I I I talked about the elect because, you know, they they think about the the Muslims, the Hindus and all these people uh very religious, very pious. They they they're sincere. But what makes the Christian religion the the only one? I said God hasn't revealed that to you as an individual. I see even the people that go to church, they go to church all over and there's so many different ways of uh of Christians what they believe. But I said the elect and the predestinated. It's that we haven't chosen God, but God chooses us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God choose chooses us. And I said there has to be a deep call into the deep. There has to be something inside of you that is crying out that I want to know truth. I want God. Amen. I want the true and living God. God, I need you. &gt;&gt; And God said, "My sheep will hear my voice." They'll know. Amen. The difference between all these other voices, all these other sounds. There are so many sounds or so many voices. Amen. But to us, it's a certain sound. Amen. Amen. They say that the trumpet gives a uncertain sound. Who going to prepare themselves for war? But God has given us a certain sound that we can hear. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's something about it. You can you explain it to anybody? Can you really uh tell somebody that Amen. that you have faith in God and that the God that you serve is the true and living God? Can you explain that? Will they understand that? No. Amen. You have to have that revelation for yourself. Amen. God has to give you a visitation and vindicate. Amen. You Amen. Know that you're sons and daughters of God as individuals. Amen. That's an individual revelation. It's not a church. Everybody in the church that go to church, they that's why some Amen. so slack. Amen. They serve God like a They serve their jobs better than they serve God. They serve their Amen. different things. They're more faithful. Amen. To the worldly things than they are to God. Amen. But those that are chosen, Amen, before the foundation of the world know what their calling is. that you're here to represent Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God, it's all it's a it's your walk with God. What God has revealed to you. You cannot walk in no more than God has revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now when I talk about the kingdom age, the question was to to Jesus in Acts one, Acts 1 and3. It it's talking about these former trios treaties have I made. O Theophus of all that Jesus began to both to teach until the day which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto his apostles whom he had chosen. to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs. God will show you by many infallible proofs. Amen. You'll walk with him. Keep walking with him. And God will prove himself to you by many infallible proofs. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll continue to open and unveil his self to you. Amen. that you'll know that you're in the right path. That you'll know that you're chosen, that you're a peculiar people, that you're a royal priesthood, that you're a holy nation, that you are the lights of the world. God will prove and vindicate that to you as you keep walking. He'll show himself alive by many infallible proofs. &gt;&gt; He'll prove it. &gt;&gt; Amen. There'll be no doubt in your mind. &gt;&gt; You're not just walking because Amen. The somebody preached something to you. Somebody said something. God has revealed himself to you. &gt;&gt; He's made himself known to you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What could make Moses give up everything that he had to follow? Amen. Those that were in bondage and slavery. What could make him identify with them? God. Amen. He had met their God who is invisible. &gt;&gt; He was wear willing to give up my all. But when people are holding on to this word, it's because they're blind. Amen. Praise God. They're blind. The devil got them blind. He said, "If our gospel be hid is hid to them that are lost, whom the God of this world has blinded the mind of them that believe not, least the light of the gospel who is the image of God should shine unto them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God hadn't sh if the light hadn't shine, I I I can't make the light shine for you. It's God. Amen. But that's got to be something in you. So God, let your light shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make yourself known unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, &gt;&gt; some kind of way. Amen. You desire truth. You desired. Amen. God to make himself known to you as an individual. But others, they just God want me to be saved. If God want me to know, and they come to church faithful. They might pay the tithe. They might sing. They might do things, but they don't want to know God. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in them that want to know God in an intimate way, in a real way. Nothing. Amen. They want to know him, but they just Amen. We talking about the kitchen and we talking about the living room, but they know me in intimate way in a close walk. They're going on from the imaticost and intercourse into the inner veil, going into the holy holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. those that want to know him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Want to know him in the power of his resurrection. Son, a lot of folks that go for the holling and the screaming and the intellectualism. But Amen. intellectualism don't bring forth a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might know all about how to do it. But you got to have that intimate relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in the he says showed himself alive by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days after Jesus rose from the dead. He showed himself alive 40 days. Amen. And speaking of the things pertaining to the what? &gt;&gt; Kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're talking about the kingdom of God. When we speak of kingdom, we must have a king in a kingdom. Amen. So uh and when they talked about Jesus as son of man, son of God, then son of David. Son of David has references to Amen. Solomon was the son of David. And it has references to Solomon rule. David fought a lot of wars. Amen. And he could not build God house. But Solomon, amen, was the son that came in and there was a peaceful reign. And he and Jesus was called the son of David, the son of peace. Amen. So Jesus, Amen, in the millennium reign, there would be Oh, I'll get to that in a minute. But he says, "And being a a assembler together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which he says, he &gt;&gt; says he, the promise of the Father, which Yeah, that's says he says he ye shall &gt;&gt; you've heard of me &gt;&gt; says he okay I was saying that with but it was coming out in something else saying it in my head for John truly baptized with water But ye shall be baptized with the what? &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Not many days hence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they were therefore come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will thou at this time restore what? &gt;&gt; See, they knew they knew what was promised. They knew that the kingdom age would come, that God would come and he would rule as king on the earth. And they were looking forward to him to be king. But what a disappointment. I believe that many people go to church and they what they're looking for, they're disappointed with it. They come to church and they're looking for Amen. They're looking for God to be real and and the power of God, but they come to church. Amen. And and it's all kind of chaos in the church. &gt;&gt; All kind of confusion. Amen. And they don't even see God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So sometimes folks give up. They just give up because they don't see what they're looking. Amen. What it says. Amen. They don't see it as a reality for them. But God reveals himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; God is still God. &gt;&gt; God is still moving. &gt;&gt; God is still fulfilling his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And doing what he said he'll do. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may not see it, but somebody Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody chosen to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. He showed himself to them because they were chosen to see. Amen. Thank God. Amen. I believe you're here. Amen. Because you God chose you to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But even in them seeing and him revealing things to them, but they said, "Master, will thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" Because they had, Amen. They knew, Amen. that the kingdom they came preaching, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But and they knew, Amen. believed that he was that king. So, but the time the time that God was going to restore the kingdom. Amen. They were looking and anticipating it right then. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. How this mighty God, this mighty God done come, Amen. down and died. Amen. And then he rose. Amen. He rose again. &gt;&gt; Oh, can they can they look at that? Amen. A resurrected Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. You It took power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To get up out the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to walk around again. &gt;&gt; And they told them that no man take my life. I lay it down. Got power to take it up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Now they see this mighty God being unveiled before them. They seeing God, amen, in the midst. Amen. And when they see us mighty God, they ask the question, "Will thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" Amen. You know, no doubt they ate with him. They fellowship with him. And Amen. Thomas done put his hand in the nail print all of that. He sat down with them and taught him for 40 days. Now they want the kingdom. Now they're ready. They're ready for the king to take over. It's our turn now. So many times people are anxious. They're excited knowing that the God what God had promised what he promised to do. Praise God. What he said he'll do and then wanted to know is this the time? I was just going back over the message, sir. Is this the time at the end? Amen. The prophet didn't know. He said, "It might be my life, might be this, might be that." But he said, "Is this the time?" He said, "I believe that this is the time with all these things that happened. I believe that the coming of the Lord is right around the corner." How many times we have anticipated the coming of the Lord to take place and it didn't take place. Amen. But uh folks are excited. But I I I I'm talking about a promise of a kingdom age. I'm talking about God. It told them that let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me and my father's. house of many mansions. I'm going away to prepare a place for you. They were looking forward to that. And you and I, Amen. You know, we don't want this world because the world, this is not our, this is not our home. This cosmos, this world order, this this what we see. Amen. With our five senses. I was talking to Josiah. I was talking about these five senses. This is not ours. Amen. the the the kingdom that God gave you and I at this particular season, this particular time, amen, was not a meat and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was going to be a physical kingdom that God was going to manifest himself and give them a kingdom age and a millennia age where Jesus Christ would be son of David and sit on the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're going to live and reign with him a what? Thousand years. &gt;&gt; A thousand years. Okay. So, but look, if you don't believe it, you go do anything you want to do. That's right. &gt;&gt; You do. You just live it up. Drink, smoke, lie, steal, cheat. If you don't believe it, just do what you want. But to them that believe, &gt;&gt; yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. They know this life here is just just short. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're only here but a few moments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like a flower. It's like grass. It's gone. But if you believe in the promise of God, Amen. I mean, it was 2 million believed in the promise of God, but only two made it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And I'm saying, Amen. You as an individual must believe that God promised you eternal life. And God promised you a millennium reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says here not just the marriage supper. He said in Jesus in the seventh verse he says unto them it is not for you to what? It's not for you to know the time or nor the what &gt;&gt; which the father has put in his what? &gt;&gt; In his own power. But look at he says he continued but but ye shall receive power. &gt;&gt; It's in his power but ye shall receive power. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants you to anticipate that no man knows. Amen. only. Amen. Praise God. It's put in his own power. But you going to get power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The power that workketh in you ought to be speaking to your inner man saying something to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The power, Amen, that God gives you ought to give you resurrection attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You, it ought to tell your time ain't long. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold on a little while longer. for what God promised he's going to perform. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to wait on it. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know God is able &gt;&gt; for these dry bones to live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bones going to come together. &gt;&gt; They might say all hope is lost. &gt;&gt; But it's not lost. &gt;&gt; I know God lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know he real. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, "But ye shall receive power &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaritan and in the utmost parts of the earth." The church getting ready to take off. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But I want you to know that power. Amen. that he says, "Amen. No man know it." Amen. But it's in the power, his own power. And you got the power and God can make himself known. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God is ready, he can release it into you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The resurrection power. &gt;&gt; And that resurrection power made you fa get so close to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That he has to come to Amen. and connect up with his bride. No longer shall she wait. &gt;&gt; Because that power is gushing you in. &gt;&gt; Amen. To your change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been ushering in to in the kingdom age. Amen. To the marriage supper. Something is moving you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Something is pulling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to feel the pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a pull of the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking you into resurrection power. Taking you to Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Folks ain't going to get excited. Amen. Until they get intellectual knowledge and it makes them excited. &gt;&gt; But there got to be a spiritual revelation move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. People get all kind of worked up in the holler and scream because they see it intellectual. But there must be a real manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There must be a real, amen, walking to on two feet. Amen. A manifestation of the son of God that they come into maturity. Amen. That they come into adoption. Amen. They're coming to their place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things are happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The supernatural God &gt;&gt; has already started to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a supernatural people. &gt;&gt; Amen. That has seen the change. Amen. You already been changed from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Even by the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said you can't tell folks about it. Too many uh intellectual good speakers can tell you all about it. But can they bring God on the scene? &gt;&gt; Can they bring him on the scene? &gt;&gt; So I want to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want to see him on the scene. &gt;&gt; I want to see him and God in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. We heard about all the miracles that he done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But if God be with us, then where be all his miracles? I'm talking about as an individual. I'm not talking about as a group. &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm talking about as an individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Children of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 65 kale. God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time to get out of here. But Amen. If if if the glory of the Lord hadn't shined upon you in this gross darkness age, he said, "Rise, shine, for the light is come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. And this gross darkness that covers the earth." Amen. There ought to be his light should be shining brighter &gt;&gt; brighter to you. Amen. Not just in revelated word but the light of God. Amen. Shining through you and in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But here we we we're just sitting around waiting on something to happen instead of making something happen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I hunger and thirst after the living God. &gt;&gt; Lord. Amen.
