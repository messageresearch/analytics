of prayer lord jesus we thank you for allowing us to be here this evening lord we thank you for coming in your house one more time lord we thank you for allowing us to gather again lord to say thank you thank you for all that you've done lord son and ken thank you for keeping us lord jesus from all sicknesses diseases anything that will come to harm us lord jesus lord we asking that you come down in our midst tonight lord move in your own special way lord speak to every need lord move us out of the way that lord you may get all the glory all the honor and all the praise lord in your name we pray amen amen this time we asked if you if you have your bible you turn to the book of matthew chapter 26. we'll start at verse 36. and when you gotta say amen amen and it reads then come with jesus with him unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder and he took with him peter and two sons and the two sons of deputy and began to be so sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful and even unto death tarry ye hear and watch with me and he went a little way further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt and he cometh unto the disciples and finds them asleep and saith unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation and the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done god had a blessing to read another's word you may be seated amen if you look here in the story this is right before jesus gets captured and goes into goes and sees pilate and eventually gets crucified but here he's in the garden of gethsemane and he's he's coming forth and he's going because he knows his trial is coming and he's asking the lord he come down to the last verse verse 42 he said oh father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done and tonight i'd like to take a topic from that from the last part of that that says thy will be done thy will be done it's something that the lord placed on my heart and came to me and i started to search the scriptures and and really look at him and and the lord said and in if you see that if you have your bibles let's turn to the book of matthew chapter six i was searching and i want to find out where else was this said and there's only two two references of this in the scripture where it says that will be done in in those manners and if you look at verse the lord teaches about in what we call the lord's prayer and he says and he starts off um verse six and nine it starts off and says after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debt so we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil but thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen and verse 10 it says thy kingdom come thy will be done and those are the only two references of thy will be done in the scriptures but it came to me and i started to look at it even more so and it says i notice how the both times it was said it was in prayer both times of these scriptures were said jesus was in prayer when he goes to the father and said lord thy will be done and it made me take a look and said when the lord wanted when he wanted guidance he went into prayer when he wanted guidance he went to to the lord and to the father above in prayer and he said lord thy will be done and many it which says that jesus had to go search for he had to go and he got to go work for he had to go go into prayer and ask lord not my will but thy will be done and he had to look further than his own thinking than his own competence than the ones around him he had to go to the one that was above because he knew that he had a plan for him he knew that he had something a guidance for him that he was for ordained to do and that's why he came and he said lord thy will be done each one of us even if we look there's something that we are supposed to do it's something that we are supposed to accomplish and the lord wanted to make sure that it was his will and not and not his own he wanted to make sure lord i am in lockstep with what you want me to do for my life i'm in lockstep for what you want me to accomplish in my life i could just do things but lord thy will be done i want you to come forth and to come down in my midst on in me and lead me and guide me so that thy will can be done not my will i don't want to go outside of what you want lord i want to be on your path for my life your path for my life not the one that i'm choosing and many times we look at so many examples but i i like to think about if you can just imagine and think about many many of us have heard the story of samson and samson how he had he was he was ordained before he was when he came on this earth to be a might to do certain things he was going to deliver god's people and just imagine and i'd like to go forward to the end of the story of samson where samson is they have already captured him they've cut off his hair and he it's his last almost his last day on life and sam saying they having this great big show the philistines have captured them and they're having this great big show in front of them and then they said bring out samson because samson was the main event sansa had been captured so they were bringing them out and they wanted to show off what they who they had captured they wanted to show off and you can think about all the people that were standing there you think about all the things samson had been through i'm sure there were two or three thousand people there to see sampson and his defeat there was two or three thousand people there to see how far samson had fallen they had plucked out his eyes they had cut off his hair so they said surely he is not the same one and so it's in just thinking about how far samson had fallen off of the path that was for him he was no longer in the will where he was supposed to be because samson had fallen and you can just think about the people that's looking at this and saying how they have finally defeated them how they had finally come forward and they had finally conquered the man that had caused him so much trouble and they could remember when samson killed the thousand with the jawbone they can remember when he picked up the gate off the cities and took it up the hill and sat it down and they say that gate might have been about a ton and just think of a little small man picking up something like that carrying it uphill when he was in the will of god those were the things that he could do things that he could accomplish by being in the will of god but you see when he got out of the will of god he no longer had the strength he couldn't conquer anything he couldn't even break loose of bindings that held him they didn't have to do anything to hold him down then because he no longer had the strength because he was outside of the will he was outside of what he was supposed to be doing for god he was outside of what he was supposed to be achieving for god and so when you look at it and you see uh where i'm supposed to be many a times you realize that you have to go through things because you left the will you have to go through things because you stepped outside of the boundaries you went on your own path not god's path so you're gonna so he sampson had to suffer for that samson had to come to that he had to go through things but at the end of samson's journey he knew that he only had one chance to get it right he only had one chance and he said he he said lord once more he was at the end of his days but he said lord once more i want to be in your will once more i'll come to the end of my journey but i want to be in your will once more lord and and and that's what samson came to that point he said he came to that journey and he said lord i want to be i want to fulfill what you wanted me to do i could have done so much more but i can't go back i can't go back and change that lord you wanted me to do so much more but he never got the opportunity to do it because he got out of the will he got out of the will of god for his life he went and did his own thing he got caught up in some situations and he had to go through because he got out of it he had to go through some different things because he got out of the will of god for his life and samson he realized that he had to get back he had to turn and go back to the one that gave that had the path for his life in the first place he had to go back and see lord what is thy will for my life in this moment what do you want me to do in this moment and they and it said when you when you look back and they said he killed more philistines on that one day than he ever did in his old time living all those moments in time see how powerful samson was now just imagine he had never lost left the will what could he have accomplished just imagine if he had never stepped outside of the boundaries what could he have accomplished but we'll never know you'll never know what you are supposed to achieve if you step out you'll never know how far how much god can use you if you move on and do your own thing you'll never know how how much of an impact you could have had in life if you step out and go your own path instead of the one god wants you to to follow in your life and so it's really important that you make sure that you are in the will of god for your life for your life not somebody else's not mama not daddy not sister not brother but for you you and but you have to go and you have to search it out even even samson came to the point where he said a prayer lord once more he said a prayer so all this is empowering you to go back and say each time jesus said lord thy will be done was in prayer which means it points out how important prayer is it points out how important prayer is to each and every one of us that's the only way we that's the way that we communicate with god so how are you going to know what you're supposed to do if you're not talking to them if you're not communicating with them how do you know what you're supposed to accomplish how do you know what you're supposed to be doing how do you know that you are actually on the right path because the bible says broad is the way to lead us to destruction so the way that seems easy many of times may not be the right path for you just because it's easy for you to go down may not mean that that's the one you're supposed to be following but you gonna follow cause it's all downhill it's easier to walk down here but it takes strength to walk up here it takes power to walk up here and it takes more than what you may be able to do so you need the strength of god to lead you up that hill and it takes it takes more than you can able to handle sometimes but god said i'll take that i'll give you strength when you're weak i'll give you money when you need it i'll give you food when you're hungry that's what he said i'll supply all your needs so if you need something then you can say lord let thy will be done and god will provide all your needs everything that you wanted to do god can give you more more than you ever thought that you could achieve and accomplish god can give it to you as long as you are in his will as long as you are in his path following what he wants you to do god can give you more than you ever thought you could more than you even can imagine there's no limit to what god can do there's no limit to what god can do for you if you only believe if you only believe that lord i'm putting my trust in your hands i'm putting my life in your hands and i'm gonna follow what you want me to do because lord thy will be done not my will but lord thy will be done and and even here in the scriptures it shows that you have to seek god and in matthew chapter 7 it said in 7 i'll just read it and it says and it shall be given to you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened to you so it takes effort it takes effort to get in god's will you have to god wants you to put forth an effort to meet him because he gives us i remember one of my friends he always used to say god gives us one thing he gives us free choice you can choose which way you want to go god will never force you but here he says if you seek him you you'll find him if you're not the door shall be open even in jeremiah it says here in jeremiah 29 and 10 and i'll read it we'll turn that jeremiah 29 and 10. just in the show and here in the scripture it was talking to jeremiah about the children of israel going to going into babylon but god god he gave them a word of encouragement jeremiah 29 and 10 have you got to say amen and it reads for thus saith the lord that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will will visit you and perform my good word toward you and causing you to return to this place but i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and he said this is in 13 and it caught my attention he said and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart most time we we want to hear the good part of the scripture and you shall seek me and find me and we want to stop there but it goes on to say when ye shall search for me with all your heart which means you got to give everything to him you got to not no small part can you keep for yourself no small part in no small corner can you keep for yourself otherwise you're not in the will you're not in god's perfect will for your life so so you got to seek him and and then you'll find him scripture says that if you call on the lord you shall he he he will answer prayer that's what the song says all on jesus he will answer prayer and when you shall search for him for me with all your he said ye shall search when ye shall search for me with all your heart so you gotta you gotta search with him for for all with all your heart in order to find them you got to give them everything in order to find them to be in you got to give them all the things every every small thing that you want to hold on to you got to give it up in order to find them you got to give everything to the lord in order for him to to to give to you order for you to reach the pinnacle of what god wants to give you you got to give it all to them they said [Music] no no pain no gain that's something that a lot of people say but it's a true thing that in order to get something great you have to you have to go through something you have to be experienced many times most time the people that if you look out here and just for example in the sports world many times the people that win championships are the ones that that have persevered through something they they may have faced failure before they might have got this close but never achieved and then one day they break through it's most time the veterans the ones that have been putting in the time behind closed doors the ones that nobody saw was practicing harder than everybody else even though they were older but they got what they call seasoned veterans and sometimes you got to be seasoned in these things and you gotta you gotta have those private moments those times when nobody saw where you were putting in the extra effort that allows you to achieve greatness that allows you to achieve the best things and you see how you have to put in what what nobody else sees you got to put in the time when nobody else sees you got to be behind closed doors sometimes those extra practices when people thought that's foolishness but look at what what they achieve look at how far they went because they were doing things that everybody else would say i'm gonna go eat i'm gonna go go play i'm gonna go do this i'm gonna do that and there was somebody else that was working out working them and they achieved more because they were doing more so you can't expect more if you're doing less yeah that doesn't work you can't expect greater if you're doing if you're not doing as much and so it takes even going back and you can parallel well if i'm not praying how can i expect big things if i'm not doing what's right how can i expect greatness from god even though i can go to god and god may do it but how well why should my expectation be this high when i've done this much work why should my why should my level of faith be this high sometimes but but you know god said you should you should have faith in the impossible you should but sometimes god wants you to put forth the effort god wants you to put forth the time in him so that he knows exactly that you mean business you mean what you say you want this you really actually want me it's not just something that you just going through the motions or i i i had this pie in the sky expectation but god knows because of the time that you committed the time that you don't put forth that you want it you want to change because you've done the actions to change you put forth the time to change you've done you you've already started to change you come forward and say lord this is i want to do this but now i'm going to put actions behind it now i'm going to do the things that i need to do to be successful you got to you got to do this and say lord i want your will to be done well what does that take that takes prayer that takes dedication that takes lord me finding out what your will is i can't i can't be in your will if i don't know what your will is i can't do what you want me to do if i don't know what you want me to do which means i gotta talk to you well the way that we talk to him is through prayer the way that we communicate with god is through prayer and it's really about getting in that mindset lord i want your will to be done for me i want what you want me to do and and so i i got to do what i need to do to get on the same page with you i got to do what i what i what i need to do to be what what you want me to be in order to achieve the greatness and the big things you have to have there's nobody that you've seen achieved greatness and didn't work for there's nobody that you've seen great in anything that you can imagine that didn't put forth time and effort behind closed doors i don't care who they are i don't care how great they are yes you may be gifted and talented but it still takes hard work to be the best it still takes dedication to to go go behind those closed doors and and be at the peak in pinnacle otherwise no matter how gifted you are you'll never reach the top you'll never reach it and if you want to be in god's will you have to put in the time you got to put in the effort you got to stay in prayer and make sure lord that i'm always in your will in everything that i do and the small things and the big things because life is going to have big decisions life is going to have small decisions but you want to be in his will in everything that you do where god is leading you and sometimes it's as simple as lord should i turn down this way or go that way it's really simple even though you may make it complicated because you think of the big things but god is the god of the small things as well he's the one that can lead you in the right path and maybe you go one way and realize there was an accident down the other way well god just led you the opposite way and you wasn't late it's as simple as that lord i want to be in your will in everything that i do every moment of my life lord i want to be in your will that's why i think the lord he put it in the lord's prayer he said when you pray pray pray that god will be done that's part of this of the scripture that he put in that prayer that if you didn't know any prayer that's the one you could pray and it covered the multitude of things lord that thy will be done thy will be done in my life thou will be done in your life and now i uplift you in prayer and you uplift me and pray lord that we all be in his will that each and every day lord what you want us to accomplish lord we want you accomplishing me i want to accomplish in you i wanted to accomplish in you that we're not overlooking nobody lord because we all want to make it we want to be in your will so that we can make it we want to be in your will so that we can see him one day we can see those ones that have passed on but how are you going to get there if you're not in his will if you're not in his will for your life how are you going to see those ones that have passed on those ones how are you going to see the lord how are you going to make it through the things that are coming up in life and in current events how are you going to make it through if you're not in the will of god for your life whatever that takes you have to get to that point that lord i want to hear you tell me what you want me to do lord i want to be able to have that connection so strong that you leading me and guiding me in each and every decision that i make in my life each and every moment of my life lord i want you to be able to say yea your name and me to be able to hear and listen and understand what you want me to do because lord i want thy will to be done in my life everything that you go through and everything that you see you said lord lord have your way and have your will in my life [Applause] hey man you appreciate the word amen that will be done amen i thought about you know as brother caleb was speaking how the scripture says that trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thy don't understand it but in all thy ways acknowledge him and he'll direct your paths you know i thought about that i says how can we acknowledge him in all our ways i mean no matter what we do we got to pray about it you know it's a lot of it's a lot of things i i thought about and i jotted some stuff down you know when he was talking about that i thought about the footsteps of the righteous they are ordered by the lord you know just just uh being in life and growing and getting a little older still young but getting a little older in life brother gordon laughing at me i said the thing is though you start to see that you know the plan that god had for you you start to see the direction that god took you down and the things that you've been through and then you start seeing that it was god the whole time that you realize the devil can't do nothing to you but what god allows and that's it come on whatever happens in this life i minister the sermon one time what god allows god allowed it and if god allowed it then i'm all right with it i might it might be some hard stuff that i had to go through but when i really think about it i said well god you allowed it and i know that you said you put no more on us than we could bear so you got to have a purpose in it and you know it's something about when god allowed it he got a purpose in it his growth gonna come out of it you know the outcome of a lot of situations determines how you looking at that situation come on do y'all believe that tonight and i said you know i thought about so many things in the bible i thought about esther and how it might have seemed bad how the king was calling all of the young girls to come bring them into their palace right from the beginning well god allowed it didn't he and then we found out later on you know her uncle's telling her and said hey you know when when now persecution came he said maybe the lord put you in that position for such a time as this because what god could see further down the road he already knows what's up ahead we don't know what's up ahead unless he show us but he knows what's up ahead so he does things and put things put us in positions that we might be all right up later on up the road but we don't understand that sometimes we don't understand sometimes what the trial about what the tribulation about lord why me come on but god already knows your steps have already been ordered he getting you prepared for what's up ahead that when the tests come you ready to face the challenge of the hour we can talk about david all the time come on you know that's the thing about it you you having faith when the challenge of the hour will come because it ain't nothing you ain't seen before come on god don't build you up for it you already you say i've been through this he brought me through this and he brought me through that come on and i don't know how and i don't know when but i know that god gonna make a way i've seen it too many times we got too many clouds of witnesses that god already worked it out so i don't know about what you gonna do come on but i'm in the masters hands lord let your will be done come on i want to walk in your will how many want to walk in his will tonight come on and i always pray that lord like you said not my will but let thy will be done come on and he said like he's bringing it out how how that was uh brought out in prayer and how when it was said that it was jesus praying you know lord father let thy will be done teaching us come on that we got to find what the will of god is you can't go after your heart we say it all the time that the heart is deceitful wicked come on desperately wicked and no and no man can know it come on your heart deceive you you can't say well i feel this in my heart come on it might be in your heart but it's your heart the will of god come on it might be within your reach but is it the will of god come on and that's what it is i said you like brother caleb was preaching tonight and i believe that i always said it lord i want your will to be done god's god like we say as we look at god's will sometimes the way god makes come on it seems to be the hardest route around look like god here it is the door right here all i got to do is walk to it but god bring you all the way around all the way around here just to get into that door he said lord why why did you do that come on but who can question god come on who can ask god god why'd you do it like this come on you might have that question in your mind but god remember he's all he's infinite he's all-knowing he knows exactly what he's doing and that's what we we look at it the situations the trials we got to start looking at them different come on i question god at many times but then god i realize in the end that god knows what's best come on god take you through hurt and if they take you through pain come on well the next time around it don't affect you as bad because you realize that god's got it all in control all of those nights i cried you know what it was about when all your friends walked away from you come on and everybody looked like they turned their back on you talked about you and called you all kind of names just because you gave your life to the lord come on a lot of times he wanted to show you that there ain't no friend like the lonely jesus he wanted you to get away to you having trust and confidence in man come on because man gonna fail you all the time they will won't they mom and daddy will fail you but it's one that won't fail you and if you got your confidence in him come on if the sun don't shine tomorrow he'll still be there come on if the rainfall tomorrow he'll still be there if everybody walk off and leave you that one come on that calls you he'll still be there now hold your hand do you believe that tonight and that's what gives us joy unspeakable and full of glory that's what gives us strength to fight and press on that's what makes us be able to look things in the face turn away and walk off and hold on to the name of jesus that's what gives us that hallelujah you know it's a lot of hurt in this life it's a lot of pain but it's something about the peace that god gives you come on a lot of people we've seen leave off the scene and go on but it's that peace that god gives you it's that assurance like the song said that he gives you deep down in your soul that he got it all in control that hey we just strangers surgeon and passing through this land anyway come on i know i see them again one day on the other shore all i got to do is keep enduring now keep fighting until the end hallelujah it's something about the will of god you know just that moment when you get ready to walk out of god's will come on that's when that breakthrough was right there i think about something the prophet god said all the says before he's talking about samson and how he says when his eyes plucked out he says what hurt him most was the memories of how god used him and how he let god down how he led his flesh come on overtake what the will of god was for his life you know the flesh does that come on so many people their heart and they desire i believe is to be in god's house to serve the lord but they didn't have power to overcome what they flesh wanted come on the apostle paul talked about it when i desire to do good evil is present with me the flesh is something that's hard to fight come on that's why you got to die daily that's why you got to let god kill it come on the things that you that you love and you desire to do sometimes you got to learn to hate those things hate is a strong word but you got to love to get away from those things because those things will come between you and god and anything that comes between you and god is an idol no matter what it is come on and you don't want to be caught in idolatry you don't want nothing in between you and god hallelujah but you want a clear path the way when you come into god here i am lord if god like he asked abraham to give up your son it wasn't no problem to abraham he said he gave him to me as one that's from the dead anyway if i give him back to him i know that god is able to raise him up hallelujah oh jesus don't let nothing come between you and god tonight do you believe that i'm stirred come on thy will be done you know i i look at life like it says one of my classmates this past sunday was killed in a call wreck and head-on collision a pretty uh popular guy grew up with and i remember the last time i talked with him was i used to talk with him some nights on the phone when he was doing some work at night and then his father passed away and then i went to his friend and i went to his house me and brother damon and talked with him and you know and then you hear that he passed away sunday in a car accident and i was telling brother damon i said you know life is so short now he was 39 years old and i was saying you know you know sometimes i look at life is real short come on you can have plans and all those things which are great but what need to be in your plans is to make heaven your home is to be pleasing to god i got plans but if the lord was to call me right now come on i don't want nothing in between me and god and out of all the plans that i got in life my greatest plan is to be on that day to hear him call my name and say well done come on enter into the jaws of the lord that supersedes all the plans that i have in life that supersedes everything i can think of and imagine that i want in life say what do you want in life i want to make heaven my home what do you want in life i want to be pleasing to god come on ain't what what is in this life come
