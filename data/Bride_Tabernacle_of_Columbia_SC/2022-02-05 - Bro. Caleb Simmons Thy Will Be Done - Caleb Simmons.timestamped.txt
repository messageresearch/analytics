[28:17] lord jesus we thank you for allowing us
[28:19] to be here this evening lord we thank
[28:21] you for coming in your house one more
[28:23] time

[28:45] every need lord move us out of the way
[28:47] that lord you may get all the glory all
[28:50] the honor and all the praise lord in
[28:52] your name we pray
[28:53] amen
[28:55] amen
[28:57] this time we asked if you
[28:59] if you have your bible
[29:01] you turn to the book of matthew
[29:04] chapter 26.
[29:12] we'll start at verse 36.
[29:28] and when you gotta say amen
[29:32] amen and it reads
[29:34] then come with jesus with him unto a
[29:37] place called gethsemane
[29:39] and saith unto the disciples sit ye here
[29:42] while i go and pray yonder
[29:45] and he took with him peter and two sons
[29:48] and the two sons of deputy
[29:50] and began to be so sorrowful and very
[29:54] heavy
[29:55] then saith he unto them my soul is
[29:57] exceedingly sorrowful and even unto
[30:00] death tarry ye hear and watch with me
[30:04] and he went a little way further and
[30:06] fell on his face and prayed saying
[30:09] oh my father if it be possible
[30:12] let this cup pass from me nevertheless
[30:15] not as i will but as thou wilt
[30:18] and he cometh unto the disciples and
[30:21] finds them asleep and saith unto peter
[30:24] what
[30:25] could you not watch with me one hour
[30:28] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[30:30] temptation
[30:32] and the spirit indeed is willing but the
[30:34] flesh is weak and he went away again the
[30:37] second time and prayed saying
[30:39] o my father
[30:41] if this cup
[30:43] may not pass away from me except i drink
[30:46] it
[30:47] thy will be done
[30:49] god had a blessing to read another's
[30:50] word you may be seated
[30:53] amen
[30:56] if you look here in the story
[30:58] this is right before jesus gets captured
[31:00] and goes into
[31:02] goes and sees pilate and eventually gets
[31:04] crucified but here he's in the garden of
[31:07] gethsemane and he's he's coming forth
[31:10] and he's going because he knows his
[31:12] trial is coming
[31:13] and he's asking the lord he come down to
[31:16] the last verse verse 42 he said oh
[31:18] father if this cup may not pass away
[31:20] from me
[31:21] except i drink it thy will be done
[31:24] and tonight i'd like to take a
[31:27] topic from that from the last part of
[31:29] that that says thy will be done
[31:32] thy will be done it's something that the
[31:34] lord placed on my heart and came to me
[31:36] and i started to search the scriptures
[31:38] and
[31:39] and really look at him and and the lord
[31:42] said and in if you see that
[31:45] if you have your bibles let's turn to
[31:47] the book of matthew chapter six
[31:52] i was searching and i want to find out
[31:55] where else was this said
[31:57] and there's only two two references of
[31:59] this in the scripture where it says that
[32:01] will be done in in those manners and if
[32:03] you look at
[32:04] verse
[32:07] the lord teaches about
[32:09] in what we call the lord's prayer
[32:11] and he says and he starts off um
[32:17] verse six
[32:21] and nine it starts off and says after
[32:23] this manner therefore pray ye our father
[32:26] which art in heaven
[32:28] hallowed be thy name
[32:31] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[32:34] in earth as it is in heaven give us this
[32:36] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[32:38] debt so we forgive our debtors and lead
[32:41] us not into temptation but deliver us
[32:43] from evil but thine is the kingdom and
[32:45] the power and the glory forever amen
[32:49] and
[32:51] verse 10 it says thy kingdom come thy
[32:54] will be done and those are the only two
[32:57] references of thy will be done in the
[32:59] scriptures but it came to me and i
[33:01] started to look at it even more so and
[33:03] it says i notice how the both times it
[33:06] was said it was in prayer
[33:09] both times of these scriptures were said
[33:11] jesus was in prayer when he goes to the
[33:14] father and said lord thy will be done
[33:16] and it made me take a look and said
[33:18] when the lord wanted
[33:20] when he wanted guidance he went into
[33:23] prayer when he wanted guidance he went
[33:25] to to the lord and to the father above
[33:27] in prayer and he said lord thy will be
[33:29] done
[33:30] and many it which says that jesus had to
[33:33] go search for
[33:34] he had to go and he got to go work for
[33:36] he had to go go into prayer and ask lord
[33:39] not my will but thy will be done
[33:42] and he had to look further than his own
[33:44] thinking than his own competence than
[33:46] the ones around him he had to go to the
[33:48] one that was above because he knew that
[33:50] he had a plan for him he knew that he
[33:52] had something a guidance for him that he
[33:54] was for ordained to do and that's why he
[33:57] came and he said lord thy will be done
[33:59] each one of us even if we look there's
[34:02] something that we are supposed to do
[34:04] it's something that we are supposed to
[34:05] accomplish and the lord wanted to make
[34:08] sure that it was his will and not and
[34:10] not his own
[34:12] he wanted to make sure lord i am in
[34:14] lockstep with what you want me to do for
[34:16] my life i'm in lockstep for what you
[34:18] want me to accomplish in my life i could
[34:21] just do things but lord thy will be done
[34:24] i want you to come forth and to come
[34:26] down in my midst on in me and lead me
[34:30] and guide me so that thy will can be
[34:32] done not my will i don't want to go
[34:34] outside of what you want lord i want to
[34:37] be on your path for my life
[34:39] your path for my life not the one that
[34:41] i'm choosing and many times we look at
[34:44] so many examples
[34:45] but i i like to think about if you can
[34:49] just imagine and think about many many
[34:51] of us have heard the story of samson
[34:55] and samson how he had
[34:57] he was he was ordained before he was
[35:00] when he came on this earth to be a might
[35:02] to do certain things he was going to
[35:04] deliver god's people
[35:06] and just imagine and i'd like to go
[35:09] forward to the end of the story of
[35:10] samson where samson is
[35:13] they have already captured him they've
[35:15] cut off his hair
[35:16] and he it's his last almost his last day
[35:19] on life and sam saying they having this
[35:21] great big show the philistines have
[35:24] captured them and they're having this
[35:26] great big show in front of them and then
[35:28] they said bring out samson because
[35:30] samson was the main event
[35:33] sansa had been captured so they were
[35:34] bringing them out
[35:36] and
[35:38] they wanted to show off what they who
[35:40] they had captured they wanted to show
[35:42] off and you can think about all the
[35:46] people that were standing there
[35:47] you think about all the things samson
[35:49] had been through i'm sure there were two
[35:51] or three thousand people there to see
[35:54] sampson and his defeat
[35:56] there was two or three thousand people
[35:58] there to see how far samson had fallen
[36:01] they had plucked out his eyes they had
[36:02] cut off his hair so they said surely he
[36:05] is not the same one
[36:07] and so
[36:08] it's in just thinking about how far
[36:11] samson had fallen off of the path that
[36:13] was for him he was no longer in the will
[36:16] where he was supposed to be because
[36:18] samson had fallen and you can just think
[36:20] about the people that's looking at this
[36:23] and saying
[36:24] how they have finally defeated them
[36:26] how they had finally come forward and
[36:28] they had finally conquered the man that
[36:30] had caused him so much trouble
[36:33] and they could remember when samson
[36:34] killed the thousand with the jawbone
[36:37] they can remember when he picked up the
[36:38] gate off the cities and took it up the
[36:41] hill and sat it down and they say that
[36:43] gate might have been about a ton
[36:45] and just think of a little small man
[36:47] picking up something like that carrying
[36:49] it uphill
[36:51] when he was in the will of god those
[36:53] were the things that he could do
[36:55] things that he could accomplish by being
[36:57] in the will of god
[37:00] but you see
[37:02] when he got out of the will of god he no
[37:04] longer had the strength
[37:06] he couldn't conquer anything he couldn't
[37:08] even break loose of bindings that held
[37:12] him they didn't have to do anything to
[37:13] hold him down then because he no longer
[37:16] had the strength because he was outside
[37:17] of the will
[37:18] he was outside of what he was supposed
[37:20] to be doing for god he was outside of
[37:23] what he was supposed to be achieving for
[37:26] god and so when you look at it and you
[37:29] see
[37:29] uh where i'm supposed to be many a times
[37:32] you realize that you have to go through
[37:34] things because you left the will
[37:37] you have to go through things because
[37:38] you stepped outside of the boundaries
[37:40] you went on your own path not god's path
[37:43] so you're gonna so he sampson had to
[37:45] suffer for that
[37:47] samson had to come to that he had to go
[37:49] through things but at the end of
[37:51] samson's journey
[37:52] he knew that he only had one chance to
[37:55] get it right
[37:56] he only had one chance and he said
[37:59] he he said lord once more
[38:02] he was at the end of his days but he
[38:04] said lord once more i want to be in your
[38:06] will once more i'll come to the end of
[38:09] my journey but i want to be in your will
[38:10] once more lord and and and that's what
[38:13] samson came to that point he said he
[38:15] came to that journey and he said lord i
[38:18] want to be i want to fulfill what you
[38:20] wanted me to do
[38:22] i could have done so much more but i
[38:24] can't go back
[38:26] i can't go back and change that lord you
[38:28] wanted me to do so much more
[38:31] but he never got the opportunity to do
[38:33] it because he got out of the will
[38:35] he got out of the will of god for his
[38:37] life he went and did his own thing he
[38:39] got caught up in some situations and he
[38:42] had to go through because he got out of
[38:44] it he had to go through some different
[38:46] things because he got out of the will of
[38:49] god for his life
[38:51] and
[38:51] samson he realized that he had to get
[38:54] back
[38:55] he had to turn and go back to the one
[38:56] that gave that had the path for his life
[38:59] in the first place
[39:00] he had to go back and see lord what is
[39:02] thy will for my life in this moment
[39:05] what do you want me to do in this moment
[39:08] and they and it said when you when you
[39:09] look back and they said he killed more
[39:11] philistines on that one day than he ever
[39:14] did in his old time living
[39:16] all those moments in time see how
[39:19] powerful samson was now just imagine he
[39:22] had never lost left the will
[39:25] what could he have accomplished
[39:27] just imagine if he had never stepped
[39:28] outside of the boundaries what could he
[39:30] have accomplished
[39:32] but we'll never know
[39:34] you'll never know what you are supposed
[39:36] to achieve
[39:37] if you step out
[39:39] you'll never know how far how much god
[39:42] can use you if you move on and do your
[39:45] own thing you'll never know how how much
[39:47] of an impact you could have had in life
[39:50] if you step out and go your own path
[39:52] instead of the one god wants you to to
[39:54] follow in your life
[39:56] and so it's really important that you
[39:59] make sure that you are in the will of
[40:01] god for your life
[40:03] for your life not somebody else's not
[40:06] mama not daddy not sister not brother
[40:08] but for you
[40:09] you and but you have to go and you have
[40:11] to search it out even even samson came
[40:14] to the point where he said a prayer lord
[40:16] once more
[40:17] he said a prayer so all this is
[40:19] empowering you to go back and say each
[40:22] time jesus said lord thy will be done
[40:24] was in prayer
[40:25] which means it points out how important
[40:28] prayer is
[40:30] it points out how important
[40:32] prayer is to each and every one of us
[40:35] that's the only way we that's the way
[40:37] that we communicate with god
[40:39] so how are you going to know what you're
[40:40] supposed to do if you're not talking to
[40:42] them
[40:43] if you're not communicating with them
[40:44] how do you know what you're supposed to
[40:46] accomplish how do you know what you're
[40:48] supposed to be doing how do you know
[40:50] that you are actually on the right path
[40:53] because the bible says broad is the way
[40:54] to lead us to destruction so the way
[40:56] that seems easy many of times may not be
[40:59] the right path for you just because it's
[41:02] easy for you to go down may not mean
[41:04] that that's the one you're supposed to
[41:05] be following but you gonna follow cause
[41:07] it's all downhill
[41:09] it's easier to walk down here but it
[41:11] takes strength to walk up here it takes
[41:14] power to walk up here and it takes more
[41:16] than what you may be able to do
[41:19] so you need the strength of god to lead
[41:21] you up that hill and it takes it takes
[41:24] more than you can able to handle
[41:26] sometimes but god said i'll take that
[41:29] i'll give you strength when you're weak
[41:31] i'll give you money when you need it
[41:33] i'll give you food when you're hungry
[41:35] that's what he said i'll supply all your
[41:36] needs so if you need something then you
[41:39] can say lord let thy will be done and
[41:41] god will provide all your needs
[41:44] everything that you wanted to do god can
[41:46] give you more
[41:48] more than you ever thought that you
[41:49] could achieve and accomplish god can
[41:52] give it to you as long as you are in his
[41:54] will
[41:55] as long as you are in his path following
[41:58] what he wants you to do god can give you
[42:00] more than you ever thought you could
[42:03] more than you even can imagine
[42:05] there's no limit to what god can do
[42:08] there's no limit to what god can do for
[42:10] you if you only believe
[42:12] if you only believe that lord i'm
[42:15] putting my trust in your hands
[42:17] i'm putting my life in your hands
[42:20] and i'm gonna follow what you want me to
[42:21] do because lord thy will be done
[42:24] not my will but lord thy will be done
[42:27] and
[42:27] and even here in the scriptures
[42:30] it shows that you have to seek god
[42:33] and in matthew chapter 7 it said in 7
[42:36] i'll just read it and it says and it
[42:38] shall be given to you seek and ye shall
[42:41] find knock and it shall be opened to you
[42:43] so it takes effort
[42:46] it takes effort to get in god's will
[42:49] you have to
[42:50] god wants you to put forth an effort to
[42:53] meet him because he gives us i remember
[42:55] one of my friends he always used to say
[42:57] god gives us one thing he gives us free
[43:00] choice
[43:01] you can choose which way you want to go
[43:04] god will never force you but here he
[43:06] says if you seek him you you'll find him
[43:10] if you're not the door shall be open
[43:12] even in jeremiah it says here
[43:14] in jeremiah 29 and 10 and i'll read it
[43:18] we'll turn that jeremiah 29 and 10.
[43:28] just in the show
[43:30] and here in the scripture it was talking
[43:32] to jeremiah
[43:34] about the children of israel going to
[43:36] going into babylon but god god he gave
[43:39] them a word of encouragement
[43:44] jeremiah 29 and 10
[43:47] have you got to say amen
[43:50] and it reads for thus saith the lord
[43:52] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[43:54] babylon i will will visit you and
[43:57] perform my good word toward you and
[44:00] causing you to return to this place
[44:03] but i know the thoughts that i think
[44:04] towards you saith the lord thoughts of
[44:06] peace and not of evil to give you an
[44:09] expected end then shall you call upon me
[44:12] and ye shall go and pray unto me and i
[44:15] will hearken unto you
[44:17] and he said this is in 13 and it caught
[44:19] my attention he said and ye shall seek
[44:21] me and find me
[44:24] when ye shall search for me with all
[44:26] your heart
[44:29] most time we we want to hear the good
[44:31] part of the scripture and you shall seek
[44:32] me and find me and we want to stop there
[44:34] but it goes on to say when ye shall
[44:38] search for me with all your heart which
[44:40] means you got to give everything to him
[44:42] you got to not no small part can you
[44:45] keep for yourself
[44:46] no small part in no small corner can you
[44:49] keep for yourself otherwise you're not
[44:51] in the will
[44:53] you're not in god's perfect will for
[44:55] your life so so you got to seek him and
[44:58] and then you'll find him scripture says
[45:00] that if you call on the lord you shall
[45:03] he he he will answer prayer that's what
[45:06] the song says
[45:07] all on jesus he will answer prayer and
[45:09] when you shall search for him
[45:11] for me with all your he said ye shall
[45:14] search when
[45:16] ye shall search for me with all your
[45:18] heart so you gotta you gotta search with
[45:20] him for for all with all your heart
[45:23] in order to find them
[45:25] you got to give them everything in order
[45:27] to find them to be in you got to give
[45:30] them all the things every every small
[45:32] thing that you want to hold on to you
[45:34] got to give it up in order to find them
[45:36] you got to give everything to the lord
[45:38] in order for him to to to give to you
[45:42] order for you to reach the pinnacle of
[45:44] what god wants to give you you got to
[45:46] give it all to them
[45:48] they said
[45:49] [Music]
[45:53] no no pain no gain that's something that
[45:55] a lot of people say but it's a true
[45:58] thing that in order to get something
[46:00] great you have to you have to go through
[46:02] something you have to
[46:04] be experienced
[46:06] many times most time the people that if
[46:08] you look out here and just for example
[46:11] in the sports world many times the
[46:12] people that win championships are the
[46:15] ones that that have persevered through
[46:17] something
[46:18] they they may have faced failure before
[46:21] they might have got this close but never
[46:23] achieved and then one day they break
[46:24] through it's most time the veterans the
[46:27] ones that have been putting in the time
[46:29] behind closed doors the ones that nobody
[46:31] saw was practicing harder than everybody
[46:34] else even though they were older but
[46:36] they got what they call seasoned
[46:37] veterans and sometimes you got to be
[46:40] seasoned in these things and you gotta
[46:42] you gotta have those private moments
[46:44] those times when nobody saw where you
[46:46] were putting in the extra effort that
[46:48] allows you to achieve greatness that
[46:50] allows you to achieve the best things
[46:53] and you see how you have to put in what
[46:55] what nobody else sees
[46:57] you got to put in the time when nobody
[46:59] else sees
[47:00] you got to be behind closed doors
[47:02] sometimes those extra practices when
[47:05] people thought that's foolishness but
[47:07] look at what what they achieve
[47:10] look at how far they went because they
[47:12] were doing things that everybody else
[47:13] would say i'm gonna go eat
[47:15] i'm gonna go
[47:17] go play i'm gonna go do this i'm gonna
[47:19] do that and there was somebody else that
[47:20] was working out working them and they
[47:23] achieved more
[47:24] because they were doing more so you
[47:26] can't expect more if you're doing less
[47:29] yeah that doesn't work
[47:31] you can't expect greater if you're doing
[47:33] if you're not doing as much
[47:35] and so it takes even going back and you
[47:37] can parallel well if i'm not praying how
[47:39] can i expect big things
[47:41] if i'm not doing what's right how can i
[47:44] expect greatness from god even though i
[47:46] can go to god and god may do it
[47:49] but how well why should my expectation
[47:51] be this high when i've done this much
[47:54] work
[47:55] why should my
[47:56] why should my level of
[47:58] faith be this high sometimes but but you
[48:00] know god said you should you should have
[48:02] faith in the impossible you should but
[48:05] sometimes god wants you to put forth the
[48:07] effort god wants you to put forth the
[48:09] time in him so that he knows exactly
[48:12] that you mean business
[48:14] you mean what you say you want this you
[48:17] really actually want me it's not just
[48:19] something that you just going through
[48:20] the motions or i i i had this pie in the
[48:23] sky expectation but god knows because of
[48:26] the time that you committed the time
[48:28] that you don't put forth that you want
[48:30] it
[48:30] you want to change because you've done
[48:32] the actions to change
[48:35] you put forth the time to change
[48:37] you've done you you've already started
[48:39] to change you come forward and say lord
[48:42] this is i want to do this but now i'm
[48:44] going to put actions behind it
[48:46] now i'm going to do the things that i
[48:48] need to do to be successful
[48:51] you got to you got to do this and say
[48:53] lord i want your will to be done well
[48:55] what does that take that takes prayer
[48:57] that takes dedication that takes lord me
[49:00] finding out what your will is
[49:02] i can't i can't be in your will if i
[49:04] don't know what your will is
[49:06] i can't do what you want me to do if i
[49:08] don't know what you want me to do which
[49:10] means i gotta talk to you well the way
[49:12] that we talk to him is through prayer
[49:13] the way that we communicate with god is
[49:15] through prayer and it's really about
[49:17] getting in that mindset lord i want your
[49:20] will to be done for me
[49:22] i want what you want me to do and and so
[49:25] i i got to do what i need to do to get
[49:28] on the same page with you i got to do
[49:30] what i what i what i need to do to be
[49:33] what what you want me to be
[49:36] in order to achieve the greatness and
[49:38] the big things you have to have there's
[49:41] nobody that you've seen achieved
[49:43] greatness and didn't work for
[49:46] there's nobody that you've seen
[49:49] great in anything that you can imagine
[49:51] that didn't put forth time and effort
[49:53] behind closed doors
[49:55] i don't care who they are i don't care
[49:56] how great they are yes you may be gifted
[49:59] and talented but it still takes hard
[50:01] work to be the best
[50:03] it still takes dedication to to go go
[50:06] behind those closed doors and and be at
[50:09] the peak in pinnacle otherwise no matter
[50:12] how gifted you are you'll never reach
[50:14] the top
[50:15] you'll never reach it and if you want to
[50:17] be in god's will you have to put in the
[50:19] time you got to put in the effort you
[50:21] got to stay in prayer and make sure lord
[50:24] that i'm always in your will in
[50:26] everything that i do
[50:28] and the small things and the big things
[50:30] because life is going to have big
[50:32] decisions life is going to have small
[50:33] decisions
[50:34] but you want to be in his will in
[50:36] everything that you do
[50:38] where god is leading you and sometimes
[50:40] it's as simple as lord should i turn
[50:42] down this way or go that way
[50:44] it's really simple even though you may
[50:46] make it complicated because you think of
[50:48] the big things but god is the god of the
[50:50] small things as well he's the one that
[50:52] can lead you in the right path and maybe
[50:55] you go one way and realize there was an
[50:57] accident down the other way
[50:59] well god just led you the opposite way
[51:01] and you wasn't late it's as simple as
[51:03] that lord i want to be in your will in
[51:05] everything that i do every moment of my
[51:07] life lord i want to be in your will
[51:09] that's why i think the lord he put it in
[51:11] the lord's prayer he said when you pray
[51:14] pray
[51:14] pray that god will be done that's part
[51:16] of this of the scripture that he put in
[51:19] that prayer that if you didn't know any
[51:21] prayer that's the one you could pray and
[51:23] it covered the multitude of things lord
[51:25] that thy will be done
[51:27] thy will be done in my life thou will be
[51:29] done in your life and now i uplift you
[51:32] in prayer and you uplift me and pray
[51:33] lord that we all be in his will that
[51:36] each and every day lord what you want us
[51:38] to accomplish lord we want you
[51:40] accomplishing me i want to accomplish in
[51:42] you i wanted to accomplish in you that
[51:44] we're not overlooking nobody lord
[51:45] because we all want to make it we want
[51:47] to be in your will so that we can make
[51:49] it we want to be in your will so that we
[51:51] can see him one day we can see those
[51:53] ones that have passed on but how are you
[51:56] going to get there if you're not in his
[51:57] will
[51:58] if you're not in his will for your life
[52:00] how are you going to see those ones that
[52:01] have passed on
[52:03] those ones how are you going to see the
[52:04] lord
[52:05] how are you going to make it through the
[52:07] things that are coming up in life and in
[52:09] current events how are you going to make
[52:11] it through if you're not in the will
[52:14] of god for your life
[52:16] whatever that takes you have to get to
[52:17] that point that lord i want to hear you
[52:20] tell me what you want me to do
[52:22] lord i want to be able to have that
[52:24] connection so strong that you leading me
[52:26] and guiding me in each and every
[52:27] decision that i make in my life each and
[52:30] every moment of my life lord i want you
[52:32] to be able to say yea your name and me
[52:34] to be able to hear and listen and
[52:36] understand what you want me to do
[52:38] because lord i want thy will to be done
[52:40] in my life
[52:41] everything that you go through and
[52:42] everything that you see
[52:44] you said lord
[52:45] lord have your way and have your will in
[52:47] my life
[52:50] [Applause]
[53:02] hey man you appreciate the word
[53:05] amen
[53:07] that will be done amen i thought about
[53:10] you know as brother caleb was speaking
[53:12] how the scripture says that
[53:14] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[53:16] and lean not to thy don't understand it
[53:19] but in all thy ways acknowledge him
[53:22] and he'll direct your paths
[53:25] you know i thought about that i says how
[53:26] can we
[53:27] acknowledge him
[53:29] in all our ways
[53:30] i mean no matter what we do we got to
[53:32] pray about it
[53:34] you know it's a lot of
[53:35] it's a lot of things i i thought about
[53:38] and i jotted some stuff down
[53:40] you know when he was talking about that
[53:42] i thought about the footsteps of the
[53:43] righteous they are ordered by the lord
[53:46] you know just just uh
[53:49] being in life and
[53:51] growing and getting a little older still
[53:54] young but getting a little older in life
[53:56] brother gordon laughing at me
[53:59] i said the thing is though
[54:01] you start to see that you know
[54:04] the plan that god had for you
[54:06] you start to see the direction that god
[54:08] took you down and the things that you've
[54:11] been through
[54:12] and then you start seeing that it was
[54:14] god the whole time
[54:16] that
[54:17] you realize the devil can't do nothing
[54:19] to you
[54:20] but what god allows
[54:24] and that's it come on whatever happens
[54:26] in this life i minister the sermon one
[54:29] time what god allows
[54:31] god allowed it
[54:32] and if god allowed it then i'm all right
[54:34] with it
[54:35] i might it might be some hard stuff
[54:38] that i had to go through
[54:40] but when i really think about it i said
[54:43] well god you allowed it
[54:45] and i know that you said you put no more
[54:48] on us than we could bear
[54:50] so you got to have a purpose in it
[54:52] and you know it's something about when
[54:55] god allowed it he got a purpose in it
[54:57] his growth gonna come out of it
[54:59] you know the outcome of a lot of
[55:01] situations determines how you looking at
[55:03] that situation
[55:05] come on do y'all believe that tonight
[55:08] and i said you know i thought about so
[55:10] many
[55:10] things in the bible i thought about
[55:12] esther
[55:13] and how it might have seemed bad
[55:15] how the king was calling all of the
[55:17] young girls to come bring them into
[55:18] their palace right from the beginning
[55:21] well god allowed it didn't he
[55:24] and then we found out later on
[55:26] you know her uncle's telling her and
[55:27] said hey
[55:28] you know when when now persecution came
[55:31] he said maybe the lord put you in that
[55:33] position for such a time as this
[55:35] because what
[55:37] god could see
[55:39] further down the road he already knows
[55:41] what's up ahead
[55:42] we don't know what's up ahead
[55:45] unless he show us
[55:46] but he knows what's up ahead so he does
[55:48] things and put things put us in
[55:50] positions that we might be all right up
[55:53] later on up the road
[55:55] but we don't understand that sometimes
[55:57] we don't understand sometimes what the
[55:59] trial about what the tribulation about
[56:00] lord why me come on but god already
[56:03] knows your steps have already been
[56:05] ordered
[56:06] he getting you prepared for what's up
[56:08] ahead
[56:09] that when the tests come you ready to
[56:11] face the challenge of the hour
[56:13] we can talk about david all the time
[56:14] come on you know that's the thing about
[56:17] it you you having faith when the
[56:19] challenge of the hour will come
[56:21] because it ain't nothing you ain't seen
[56:22] before
[56:23] come on
[56:24] god don't build you up for it
[56:27] you already you say i've been through
[56:28] this he brought me through this and he
[56:30] brought me through that come on and i
[56:32] don't know how and i don't know when but
[56:34] i know that god gonna make a way
[56:36] i've seen it too many times we got too
[56:38] many clouds of witnesses that god
[56:40] already worked it out so i don't know
[56:42] about what you gonna do come on
[56:44] but i'm in the masters hands
[56:46] lord let your will be done come on i
[56:48] want to walk in your will how many want
[56:50] to walk in his will tonight come on
[56:53] and i always pray that
[56:55] lord like you said not my will but let
[56:57] thy will be done come on and he said
[57:00] like he's bringing it out how how that
[57:02] was uh brought out in prayer and how
[57:05] when it was said that it was jesus
[57:07] praying you know lord father let thy
[57:10] will be done teaching us come on that we
[57:12] got to find what the will of god is you
[57:14] can't go after your heart we say it all
[57:16] the time that the heart is deceitful
[57:18] wicked come on desperately wicked and no
[57:21] and no man can know it come on your
[57:23] heart deceive you you can't say well i
[57:25] feel this in my heart come on
[57:28] it might be in your heart but it's your
[57:30] heart the will of god
[57:32] come on
[57:33] it might be within your reach but is it
[57:35] the will of god
[57:37] come on
[57:38] and that's what it is i said you like
[57:40] brother caleb was preaching tonight and
[57:42] i believe that i always said it lord i
[57:44] want your will to be done god's god like
[57:46] we say as we look at god's will
[57:48] sometimes the way god makes come on it
[57:51] seems to be
[57:53] the hardest route around look like god
[57:56] here it is the door right here all i got
[57:57] to do is walk to it but god bring you
[57:59] all the way around all the way around
[58:02] here just to get into that door he said
[58:04] lord why why did you do that come on but
[58:06] who can question god
[58:09] come on
[58:11] who can ask god god why'd you do it like
[58:13] this come on you might have that
[58:14] question in your mind
[58:16] but god remember he's all he's infinite
[58:19] he's all-knowing he knows exactly what
[58:21] he's doing
[58:22] and that's what we we look at it the
[58:24] situations the trials
[58:27] we got to start looking at them
[58:28] different
[58:29] come on i question
[58:31] god at many times
[58:33] but then god i realize in the end that
[58:36] god knows what's best come on
[58:39] god take you through hurt and if they
[58:41] take you through pain
[58:43] come on
[58:44] well the next time around it don't
[58:45] affect you as bad
[58:47] because you realize that god's got it
[58:49] all in control
[58:50] all of those nights i cried you know
[58:52] what it was about when all your friends
[58:54] walked away from you
[58:56] come on
[58:57] and everybody looked like they turned
[58:59] their back on you talked about you and
[59:01] called you all kind of names just
[59:02] because you gave your life to the lord
[59:04] come on
[59:06] a lot of times he wanted to show you
[59:07] that there ain't no friend like the
[59:08] lonely jesus
[59:10] he wanted you to get away to you having
[59:13] trust and confidence in man come on
[59:15] because man gonna fail you all the time
[59:18] they will won't they mom and daddy will
[59:21] fail you but it's one that won't fail
[59:22] you and if you got your confidence in
[59:25] him come on if the sun don't shine
[59:27] tomorrow he'll still be there come on
[59:30] if the rainfall tomorrow he'll still be
[59:32] there
[59:33] if everybody walk off and leave you that
[59:35] one come on that calls you he'll still
[59:37] be there now hold your hand do you
[59:39] believe that tonight and that's what
[59:41] gives us joy unspeakable and full of
[59:44] glory that's what gives us strength to
[59:46] fight and press on that's what makes us
[59:48] be able to look things in the face turn
[59:50] away and walk off and hold on to the
[59:52] name of jesus that's what gives us that
[59:55] hallelujah
[59:56] you know it's a lot of hurt in this life
[59:59] it's a lot of pain
[1:00:01] but it's something about the peace that
[1:00:02] god gives you
[1:00:04] come on
[1:00:05] a lot of people we've seen leave off the
[1:00:07] scene and go on
[1:00:09] but it's that peace that god gives you
[1:00:11] it's that assurance like the song said
[1:00:13] that he gives you deep down in your soul
[1:00:16] that he got it all in control that hey
[1:00:19] we just strangers surgeon and passing
[1:00:21] through this land anyway come on i know
[1:00:23] i see them again one day on the other
[1:00:25] shore all i got to do is keep enduring
[1:00:28] now keep fighting until the end
[1:00:30] hallelujah it's something about the will
[1:00:33] of god you know just that moment when
[1:00:35] you get ready to walk out of god's will
[1:00:37] come on
[1:00:38] that's when that breakthrough was right
[1:00:40] there
[1:00:41] i think about something the prophet god
[1:00:43] said all the says before he's talking
[1:00:45] about samson and how he says when his
[1:00:48] eyes plucked out he says what hurt him
[1:00:51] most was the memories
[1:00:53] of how god used him
[1:00:55] and how he let god down
[1:00:58] how he led his flesh come on
[1:01:01] overtake what the will of god was for
[1:01:04] his life
[1:01:05] you know the flesh does that
[1:01:08] come on so many people their heart and
[1:01:10] they desire i believe is to be in god's
[1:01:12] house
[1:01:13] to serve the lord but they didn't have
[1:01:15] power to overcome what they flesh wanted
[1:01:18] come on
[1:01:19] the apostle paul talked about it when i
[1:01:21] desire to do good evil is present with
[1:01:24] me
[1:01:24] the flesh is something that's hard to
[1:01:26] fight come on that's why you got to die
[1:01:29] daily
[1:01:30] that's why you got to let god kill it
[1:01:32] come on
[1:01:33] the things that you that you love and
[1:01:35] you desire to do sometimes you got to
[1:01:37] learn to hate those things
[1:01:40] hate is a strong word but you got to
[1:01:41] love to get away from those things
[1:01:43] because those things will come between
[1:01:44] you and god and anything that comes
[1:01:47] between you and god is an idol no matter
[1:01:49] what it is come on and you don't want to
[1:01:51] be caught in idolatry you don't want
[1:01:53] nothing in between you and god
[1:01:55] hallelujah but you want a clear path the
[1:01:58] way when you come into god here i am
[1:02:00] lord if god like he asked abraham to
[1:02:02] give up your son it wasn't no problem to
[1:02:04] abraham he said he gave him to me as one
[1:02:07] that's from the dead anyway if i give
[1:02:09] him back to him i know that god is able
[1:02:11] to raise him up
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:14] oh jesus don't let nothing come between
[1:02:16] you and god
[1:02:17] tonight do you believe that i'm stirred
[1:02:20] come on thy will be done
[1:02:23] you know i i look at life
[1:02:25] like it says
[1:02:27] one of my classmates this past sunday
[1:02:29] was killed in a call wreck
[1:02:32] and head-on collision
[1:02:34] a pretty uh popular guy grew up with and
[1:02:37] i remember the last time i talked with
[1:02:39] him was i used to talk with him some
[1:02:41] nights on the phone when he was doing
[1:02:42] some work at night and then his father
[1:02:45] passed away and then i went to his
[1:02:46] friend and i went to his house me and
[1:02:48] brother damon and talked with him and
[1:02:50] you know and then you hear that he
[1:02:52] passed away
[1:02:53] sunday in a car accident and i was
[1:02:56] telling brother damon i said you know

[1:03:00] now he was 39 years old
[1:03:03] and i was saying you know
[1:03:05] you know sometimes
[1:03:07] i look at
[1:03:08] life is real short
[1:03:10] come on
[1:03:12] you can have plans and all those things
[1:03:14] which are great but what need to be in
[1:03:17] your plans
[1:03:19] is to make heaven your home
[1:03:22] is to be pleasing to god i got plans
[1:03:25] but if the lord was to call me right now
[1:03:29] come on i don't want nothing in between
[1:03:31] me and god
[1:03:33] and out of all the plans that i got in
[1:03:35] life my greatest plan is to be on that
[1:03:38] day to hear him call my name
[1:03:40] and say well done come on enter into the
[1:03:43] jaws of the lord that supersedes all the
[1:03:45] plans that i have in life that
[1:03:47] supersedes everything i can think of and
