let us just stand second corinthians three second corinthians three amen we were talking on friday night concerning the rejected king and sort of how israel rejected uh the messiah i mean it was rejected not samuel and they wanted a king like the other nations amen and god told samuel that they didn't reject samuel but they rejected him from ruling over reigning over them so they had a king but they didn't know it was an invisible king amen so this morning we have a king king jesus amen praise god he's visible to the believer turn it down he's invisible to the believer but to the unbelievable they cannot see this god that we serve amen because it takes faith to sin amen second corinthians three and one it says do we begin to command ourselves or need we as some other episcopal's accommodation to you are letters of accommodation from you ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestedly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in the flesh the tables of the heart and such trust we have through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of a god who also has made us evil ministers of the new testament not in le in not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killing but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraved in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the administration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceeding glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in disrespect by reason of the glory that excellent for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remains is glorious saying then that we have such hope we use great plainies of speech and not its moses which put a veil over his face and that that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remained at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this state when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty god bless doing this word you may be seated glory to jesus god is good amen uh he said where that spirit of the lord is there's liberty he says here in the um 18th verse but we all with open faces beholding us in a glass the glory of the lord a change unto the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord now in ii corinthians 4 he says therefore sin we have this ministry as we receive mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty and not walking and crafting this nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth committing ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be here it is here to them that are what lost amen we want to talk about the unveiling of god this morning amen god no and you know somebody might say the mighty god is unveiled before us amen the unveiling of god god we if we look back at the tabernacle in the old testament it was the outer courts and then we had the holy place and then we had the most holy place so by the grace of god that was and then we look at it as being justification when we give god come to god by faith and god justified us forgive us of our sins and we are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen then we're sanctified we come into the holy place amen our our lives get cleaned up god washington of the world by the word god began to sanctify us clean our lives take things out he sanctifies us amen all the time we say the glass that was in the mud it's picked up out of the mud are you with me you're picking up out the mood amen justification you've been picked up out of the mud amen we're in our sins and god picked us up out of our sins now after he pictures the glasses of glass up he began to clean it up and wash it amen then we come into the holy place where we're sanctified then we there's another veil there and that's the most holy place and that's where the chicano glory is amen so in the inner veil it's where we want to be amen we want to be in the most holy place amen so the unveiling of god nobody could go back there but the high priest he went once a year are you with me so here we go and that's we're talking about going into the baptism of the holy ghost now before god can fill us up he's got to clean us up amen if you're not cleaned up amen you know oftentimes we hear this saying god will not dwell in an unclean place amen so god has to clean this up in order to fill us up who wants to drink out of a dirty glass are you with me you see the glass is all filthy and dirty and you put your substance in you don't want to fill it up with the water or or some type of drink you got to clean it up before you drink out it right so we all was you know we were filthy all of us was we were sinners amen but god saved us one day he even we heard the gospel we heard that jesus died for our sins and we accepted jesus christ as our savior lord and savior right well after after receiving jesus christ after he we accepted him as our savior amen still it had to be a working god had to work on us amen the spirit had to get some things out of our lives amen we were amen though god has called us and though we accepted him now god want to clean us up amen you know some folks never pass the first stage that's as far as they go and a lot of times they say they're born again we're born again you've been born again you accepted jesus christ now you're born again you know the bible says now to be born again according to jesus jesus so nicodemus except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of god nicodemus said how can a man be born when he's old can he earn a second time into his mother's womb i'm going too fast are y'all with me you know some of y'all is just rehearsing amen praise god we're going to get to heaven we're going to sing a shout out amen so by the grace of god not it's a stage okay so by the grace of god god wants to do more for us than we think we have you know sometimes things have become so common to us and we've heard it so much till we think we got it and a lot of times amen god wants to amen he said he he told them to write the commandments in their forehead read them day and night he wanted them to continually remember what god had done for them and and though they thought well what's use because he wants you amen uh they're meditating and day and night amen that's why david said that word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against you i want that word to be so engraved down inside of you because i want that word to be a part of you are you with me that when the enemy come in like a flood then you've got something aim at the lip of a standard against him amen so you got to have something to drive that devil back when he can begin to attack you jesus amen when satan amen began to say tempt him he said man it is written amen so you got to say what's written praise god but it's one thing to know that it's written amen you you said i i believe the word but believing and not living it is saying that you don't believe it are you with me see because if you say you believe it then you amen you live it what you believe you live and if you don't live it and you say you believe it then you don't believe it are you with me so as many people go to church and they said i believe jesus christ as my lord and my savior amen and i believe that i'm a christian you believe it but amen it's one thing to believe in another things amen to live it if that if what you believe can't be brought to light manifestation you know i says uh uh uh i preached a sermon some time ago i said read me read me and where did i get that from he says uh this uh three and uh two he said ye are epistles written in our hearts known and what read of all men amen see if god has been amen revealed to you and god it has come into you amen then yo your flesh veil may hide he meant the the god that's in the inside i i heard him say we have this tragedy in the earthly vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us see amen it's god amen kid in christ amen it was god veiled in a man called jesus but it was god that was in christ so jesus was able to say when you see me you see my father why they were looking at a man but amen god was in the man called jesus amen people look at you but amen it's the unveiling it's a veil there that they're looking at a flesh field but they don't know that god is in you and he's the hope of glory and the god that's in you make the difference amen because you become a part of god are you with me and all that god was amen praise god the works that i do shall you do amen amen because greater works oh hallelujah amen you want to be able to recognize who's in you and if he's in you then amen amen he said not the letter the letter killed him not just because you said i believe the word he said the letter killing but the spirit give what give life amen and if you got that in life then you got that power to manifest what you believe amen the holy ghost come to demonstrate what you believe praise god amen the letter just said i got it i got it i got it but amen except the water comes on the seed the water the seed and bring the seed to life praise god the spirit comes to quicken the word amen and to bring it to life that it might manifest itself are you with me so amen god amen not only is veiled in christ but in that christ is veiled in the bride in amen in you and when and when christ is unveiled in you amen then it's no more paul said there's no more i to live but it's christ that liveth in me jesus died for us that we might live amen the purpose of his death amen that he can descend and come down and dwell in you and i a sin he accepted that he might be sin amen praise god and i thank god for him dying he went down and he died and the reason we die to ourselves we have to die amen that we can a maybe live amen for others once you die to yourself you can live and other folk can read read me people are reading you every day they read the way you talk they read the way you walk they read the way you live amen the way you live in order they ought to see amen not you amen they ought to see jesus in you praise god the life that amen that is it exemplified amen the book that they should be reading amen is the same amen jesus said lord i come in the volume of the book and it's written to me to do thy will oh god amen what they should be reading is the book they meant the same bible that's written the same jesus that was manifested in the scriptures of all that same jesus is still living today and he should be living in you and i are you with me but if it's only talk praise god it's on if it's only talk praise god y'all mighty choir amen we got a quiet church this morning amen but you know it it it it takes us entering into that which is within the veil are you with me we got to you know in order to get something we got to give something amen if you want something from god it's all right to say amen it's all right to say i believe it's all right to say i receive it's all right to pray to god god i need something from you praise god lord i need a word from you i need something from you okay now read me read me because and and it's going to let me just skip down here in the fourth chapter amen of second corinthians it says he says for we preach not ourselves fear first for we preaching on ourselves but christ jesus our lord and ourselves your servant for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this trade and earthly vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we're trouble on what trouble on every side yet not what we're perplexed but not what persecuted but not what cast down but not what always burned about in our body to what see you're burying your body the dying of the lord jesus i i die daily i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live amen it's a dying out you got to die to yourself doctor what you will and what you want you got to say lord amen i want your will to be done in my life amen and i said you know on friday to reject reject the word is to reject the king amen the king that amen paula said uh put an inscription amen the king of the jews you said i don't want him but those were the people that he came to save those are the people that he came to die for those were the people he came to reveal god and let them see their god amen but because he had a veil on it because the bible said who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he should grow up as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground amen praise god but we hear this is where our face is from him amen and when we saw him there was no beauty that we should desire of him amen and that's what it is the word of god amen has come to you and i and christ is revealed in his own word and yet the people seem to be looking amen amen it's just like god's servants say god was in moses it was not moses that brought the children of israel out of egypt it was god amen praise god when the people disrespected moses they was disrespecting god when the people rejected samuel they rejected god when the people reject you they're rejecting god are you with me praise god because you are representing him you are an ambassador amen we pray you in christ said be you reconciled to god are you with me praise god but when you reject the word amen see that's what wrong amen when when somebody's singing the the word of god amen it's god amen trying to talk to you amen you say well i uh this is that when somebody's preaching amen it's god amen it's talking to you it's the word of god coming to you amen and what and don't let when the anointing in the power of god amen do amen the holy ghost is being ministered to you and you reject the holy ghost you're rejecting god praise god when you say this is the devil it meant then you amen become a black streamer of the holy ghost praise god when they said he casted out devils invincible praise god when they said the amen and true folks are so quick amen to judge that when the holy ghost is moving and when the holy ghost is not moving and when it's man is when it's you know be careful amen because if you make a mistake you can be condemning jesus again and crucifying the flesh the same god god can be inside of an individual you can think amen praise god it's just it's a song song it's just brother so and so but that's god veiled inside of them amen praise god he said touch not my anointing through my prophets no harm saul when he's on the way down to the masses to persecute the church he was persecuting god why because god was veiled in his people are you with me and he said who are you lord the lord said i'm jesus whom you what you perceive you name it touch not minority to my prophets no heart be careful amen that's why we above all things love one another amen praise god show love amen be merciful be kind be tenderhearted one towards another praise god some folks you got to get a crowbar and try to apply some love out of them and some loving kindness they don't know how to be nice they said this is the way god made me amen god made you god is a god of love and with loving kindness have i drawn you are you a man praise god you'll find amen that god is a merciful god god is not a god he said i didn't come to church to condemn the world but i come to save and i believe some of us come to condemn amen and not to save praise god i believe that we got to come amen to a place where amen we'll see a saint a loving savior that cares about us and cares about our lives cares about our everything about us a god that cares a god that loves a god that heals god to forgive and of god amen they said i forgive you no matter what you've done amen no matter how you lived i forgive you they meant a god of compassion a god of understanding a god that cares about him and he cares about the lord amen praise god those that are oh god despised and rejected of the world yet god cares about him amen those that have been through some things but god said i still care oh the god that can lift you up out of the gutter god that can change you they may praise god a god that can take a woman name that five husbands amen and turn a whole life what side time turn it around a god that can catch a woman in a doctrine said i forgive you praise god a god that'll let a king amen praise god do the things that david did they meant got a man killed and took his wife and oh god a god that can sell man after my own heart he can do some trains thing that's a god that cares amen a god that you can't understand and you can't figure it out but oh hallelujah it's the god of the bible it's a god that knows amen better than you and i it's a god that cares amen we're trying to understand and we're trying to figure it out without to leave it alone i said leave it alone let god do what he wants praise god and sometimes we try to figure out god and we try to figure out one another they meant let's be compassionate unless we understand it amen know that we serve a god that knows it all are you with me so by the grace of god as we i guess i got i got to go a little fast let me slow down for a moment read me the bible says we're written and read of all men what if somebody would be reading you this morning what would they how would they read you somebody says feel me i'm saying read me you know i've ran into people or in foreign countries especially from india in different places and they could read your forehead and read your poem and they said how you you know did anybody read your palm no no no no no no but i ran into people says i can read you i re i read your forehead it's telling someone about you this and that you say how do you do that yeah i just walked in the store and the man told me he says you so and so and so and so on i said oh okay you know if god would just put his eyes or somebody with focus and look at what do you want people to see if somebody was reading you what do you wanted to see how kind and how loving you are he said you know some folks get the idea i don't care what folks think about me jesus wanted to show the compassion of god and the love of god and any christian that's truly saved he don't they don't want to present a personality that is a negative personality they don't want to present themselves as uh they want to show the compassionate of god they want to be easily to be entreated they want to show compassion and loved and look at the attributes of god he's jehovah jiren he's the lord the prophet he's jehovah shalom he's our peace amen the thing that god the bible calling wonderful counts the prince of peace see it's different characteristics look at what the spirit the attributes of the spirit love joy meekness kindness all of those attributes of the spirit if they were looking at you would they see those attributes would they see jesus the kind of person jesus was is that the kind of person is god veiled in you is is god being veiled in your flesh is god hidden this is what he said in colossians three and one colossians are you all right this morning you love the lord amen and because we love him amen we yield ourselves and to renounce us it's very understanding we we come to a place where christians have gotten so cold and lukewarm that they don't even care how they present themselves they don't seem to care as he said i would that you were hot or cold because lukewarm i spew you out of my mouth people don't seem to care about how they present themselves and they'll they'll be so nice and irritated right in your face almost like you something wrong so why should we always just check yourself when you find the depression is on you you got to find a place you can let off the pressure where you can reflect jesus christ because we all can get a little worked up and get a little you know pressure on us and that we're not in the right place at the time but when we find ourselves not in the right place then we got to go to the altar and just find that upper room experience lord i need a refilling of your spirit and i know when you get the holy ghost you're going to reflect the love of god when you well when folk are scared to approach you then you got you know you ought to be easily to being treated a folk or you know i don't know what i i'm gonna tell you something the devil he's difficult to reapproach jesus jesus i know who you are why you come to term you know so it's it's a two it's a two-edged sword it's two ways now praise god people when they know that you're a christian and they you know they they you know they're cursing and smoking and drinking they're doing all kind of crazy stuff and they don't want to approach you because they know you might smell the cigarettes or the alcohol all of that stuff and so now it's not that you are difficult to approach it's that the holiness of god the people can look at you i tell the story about elijah young preacher it was one of the they had the bong man and nicholson he was on television and everybody saw the bong man but i said the bone man he was just one of the root doctors in the area and i was supposed to preach a funeral and that's particular right down the street from the bone man house in nichols south carolina anyway it was a uh it was a funeral and there's a bunch of preachers on the pulpit and uh i was do do a part i they said i was too young to preach it i was supposed to preach the funeral because the young men two brothers got killed and they going to church with me but their mama was in florida and she come back and they said let's that boy too young to preach that old preacher preached it said old preacher preaching he really done a super job i don't think i could preach like that not at the age of us and but when i got outside and um it was an old shark fella and he he said preaching i want to tell you something come here he said you see all those preachers there's a lot of preaching on the prophet he said you know something you were the only one up there right and then he took a piece of sheet of paper he put some dirt on it and he did it like that and three crosses showed up and then i later on i found out that was one of the main route doctors in the area but he said i'm scared of you huh take an offering and put it in church for me and i'm you know i'm just a young preacher just on the scene don't know nothing about all that stuff i'm gonna tell you something the devil are recognized as god's servant said the devil recognized you before before before the average christian recognize who you are the devil will recognize you as a young preacher i i tell another young preacher preacher it's the people in the church giving me a rough time and i said oh but the lord was blessing the church to

can't bring forth life it can't bring forth fruit it can't bring forth the power of resurrection are you of me until there's a death then that cannot be a resurrection praise god you got to die to your ways and your thoughts and your ideas and then there's a resurrection the seed amen the word has been planted properly in good ground it brings forth fruit he said i would let you bring forth fruit and your fruit shall remain praise god because amen it can't bring forth any fruit because there's no death the seed got to die amen and that's what god wants to the word amen and you to crucify you then i can die to myself that the word can have life praise god until i i can receive the word but it can fall on some bad ground are you with me praise god but till it go down in my heart until i understand god praise god sometimes the amen the word might hit some places and do some things in me praise god that god wants to root some stuff out of us they may god want to kill some demons amen that's been uh uh there for a long time and god want to kill some of your old nature some of that old man amen praise god they've been handed down from generation to generation through your four fathers and all of that and your parents of old grandparents have been going through the family line god want to kill some of those ancestors demons are you up man praise god what what they were and what they've been through amen and then you're going through to fulfill the same cycle god want to break the cycle are you up me praise god and you don't want the cycle to be broken amen you got to yield and surrender yourself to god and you got to say god i'm ready ain't meant to do whatever you will and whatever you want to do in my life god i want you to do it now praise god amen crucify me afresh lord amen jesus died for me and i'm willing to die for christ's sake are you with me because i wanted the resurrection to take place i want to be a new creature i want to be a new i want to be made over again god i'm not satisfied with my present state i need to die to myself lord help me now oh yes when we're really when we're willing to submit ourselves and we're willing to subject ourselves unto the cross amen he said if any man come after me let him first of all deny himself and take up his cross and follow me amen i'm telling you brother sister but jesus by the cross alone and all the world go free but certainly there's a cross for everyone there's a cross for me what about you brother elijah's three i'm finally getting there is god all right it says for if you then be ridden with christ what seek those things which are above where christ said it don't know what such or what for ye or what see we talking about the unveiling because you're hidden if our gospel here that's hit to them another laws praise god you're a hidden treasure in the earth god amen the world can't see who you are praise god they don't know you the bible said he was in the world the world was made by him but the world didn't know him amen the world don't know who you are they can't see you they may they see your flesh they see your outward shell but they cannot see the real you and that's christ that dwells inside of you that's the new man that's the image that we're reflecting you should be reflecting the new man not the old man reflecting the new man amen which is christ jesus he says you're dead and your life is here with christ amen for when christ who is our life shall what then shall ye also what he said modify therefore what your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness in order to affection evil concurrency covetousness which is idolatry for which things say the wrath of god comment on the children of what god has identified the children of disobedient and the children of god are you with me brothers and sisters you have a decision you can make do i want to reflect jesus christ but before i can i have to be crucified i got to modify these memos which are upon the earth i got to die out to myself everybody amen are you willing to do that uh are you willing to come in grips with the word and says lord i want to be obedient i want to be a willing praise god because he don't want it if you don't want him you know some people want somebody that don't want them are you a man you know how some folk running behind somebody don't want them but jesus is not trying to run you down he said whosoever will well let him come take up the lord of life what freely he wants you to freely give your all because he i got something i want to give you in other words i got eternal life for you i can give you see what god has to give you is worth it brother sister amen his love can't know i don't care what kind of love you've got no it's the love of god i'm gonna tell you once you embrace this love it's nothing in this world compares to the love of god there's nothing that you can do it's unexplainable once you embrace the love of god it's unexplainable i cannot tell you you have to this is you know it's just like somebody says you can bite off the apple and you can taste it and then you can ask somebody else how how how the apple taste and they can say it tastes sweet they can't say it because they hadn't tasted it are you with me and that's what it is you know a lot of folks say well i i i i used to be a christian i certainly i might say the bible said taste and see that the lord he is what good amen and the goodness of the lord leading the leader man to repentance are you with me so if you're loving this morning if you taste it if something down inside of you said i like i like this word it's something it's resonating it's going down somewhere something telling me this is this this is what i need and i want more of
