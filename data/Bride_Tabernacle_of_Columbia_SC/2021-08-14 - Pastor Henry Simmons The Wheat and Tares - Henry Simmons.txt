save heal and deliver set free by the power of the holy ghost bless the sanctions trump the lord and mullin's lord and different areas lord bless the saints and mary and father in jesus name amen the book of matthew 13 as we stand for the reading of the word 13 and 36. 13 and 36 then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came to him saying declaring to us the parable of the terrors of the field and he answered and said unto them he that sword the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that soul them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they should gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the kingdom of their father who has ears to hear let them hear god bless the reasons words you may be seated the 13 chapters talks about the the tears in the wheat the wheat and the terrors and it was in a powerful form but jesus said to his disciples is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom but unto them i speak to them in parables so tonight we want to say the wheat and the terrors but we understand that certain things were to take place at the end of the world so at the hardest time this is harvest time the end of the world so all these happenings the culver 19 and all the different um calamities and the world is falling apart and just things that man cannot with all his efforts he cannot pull the different crises that are going on over the world you cannot handle it so by the grace of god is telling you amen that we're at the end we have gone to our limits we're going as far as man can go amen and what happens is total chaos after a while so we're going into the mind of men have gone totally insane so insanity has set in on the world but we want to understand the wheat and the tares we understand that the good seed amen are the children of the kingdom but let's just deal with the terrors the terrorists or the children of the what wicked one are you are y'all with me they're the children of the wicked one what we notice here in first john he said the enemy that sold the tares was the devil right first john 3 and 12 the children of the wicked one now we got to understand that there are two seeds that the children of the kingdom and the children are the wicked one and in the end time in the heart end of the world there would exist the children of the kingdom the good seed and the tares at the end of the world he said let it be and at the end of the world amen a harvest they send forth his angels are you with me so we're at the end of the world and god has sent forth his angels and they'll it's going to be a separation time the tears are going to be gathered in the bundles to be burned amen so we understand that there's a gathering together of the wicked ones and there'll be amen the children of the kingdom the good seed are getting ready amen the great carbine is coming forth amen together the children of the kingdom amen god amen got a place for you and i as we call the rapture the marriage supper amen of the lamb amen it's going home time it's time to get out of this evil world for the god of this evil age it's satan so this is an evil age that we're in but we got to get out get ready to go home go to what god forbane for us before the foundation of the world god's folks saw you and he saw amen you in his mind and you were a thought in the mind of god amen but the thought when it's expressed is a word amen and the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god amen so you were in the word is the sea are you with me the word is the seed and you the good seed that comes forth from the mind of god as through his full knowledge amen you were for ordained to come forth in the last days to recognize who you are that you come from god and you go back to god you are an attribute attribute in the mind of god amen praise god but you must be expressed in this last thing why my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow amen what you hear is something inside of you that it quickens to you it makes it it makes sense to you it don't make no sense to the rest of the world but it it it's something that you find out they meant your father is calling you and your father happened to be the word it's jesus calling you back to where you were amen so here first john 3 and 12. now we understand that the tares are the children of the wicked one he says not as cain who was what okay the 11th verse says for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that you shall what see the love of god is agape love i was dealing with somebody not long ago and they can't seem to love their enemies you got to love them that despisefully use you and speak all manner evil against you falsely you got to love them to spit in your face are you with me but you cannot do it in your feeling your your worldly nature you have to have god's divine nature that comes with the holy ghost and that's a god pay love being bestowed upon you are you with me without that a god pay love why not you allow jesus christ to come down inside of you without the baptism of the holy ghost without the spirit of god you cannot love like that you can try it it'll be difficult for you and it'll be a lot of work and even though no matter how hard you work i just sometimes i when i was young i used to debate a little bit with the jehovah witness or maybe i'll debate a little bit with the mormons and the one thing they can't do they can't get upset and i know that so i would show them something in the bible and then get them pushing in the corner then they get upset i said no no no no you can't do that now so they supposed to keep calm but you you realize when you're showing them things in the bible that goes against what they've been taught then they begin to get upset because amen you began to expose the enemy are you with me but when people can push a button or they can say something to you to get you furious and get you uh blow you out of proportion the bible said be angry and what sin not are you with me but they almost are saying that they when they go out and witness they can't get angry it's all right for us to get angry but this tells us not to sin in their right it's difficult to get angry and don't sing are you with me that's why they tell them don't get angry because it's very difficult to get angry and don't sin okay it says here for this is that you love one another now that's something that the devil can love them to love them and you know my biggest problem in pastoring and teaching people people love who they want to love and that's the attributes of the tares they love this one they love that one and they don't like that one i can't stand that one so you can tell who's tears and who's weak by their fruits you shall know them isn't that right now if they're not born again but we have those that three kind of believers we have to make believers are you with me which are the hypocrites they say they could see but actually they're not you have the unbeliever and they know where they stand and then you have the true believer amen and you're going to be tested that the fruits that you bring forth on the tree of your life it's going to be manifested what you are are you with me so you got to be careful that you don't bring forth either free fruit for a good tree cannot bring forth what evil fruit amen you can't get sweet water and bitter water out the same fountain can you okay let's now i says love one another it's it it's all right to love this and they don't love that one you know people said well well it's it's in it's excusable excuse me it's some things in life that keeps you from going you know i'm attracted to the down and out and those that may have perhaps in the crack or the drug added or the the you know the prostitute or the uh the ones that seem to be the you know the lowest of the low i i'm kind of attracted to those type people you know it's a why i those are the people that i'm reaching now i'm reaching out i'm trying to identify with them but you know that most people that say they're christians they don't want to identify those type people matter of fact uh when jesus was identifying with them they said if he'd have known who this woman was that was uh kissing his feet and watching it you don't know who that woman is but jesus knew exactly who the woman was that was doing that to him oh you look man and then they brought the woman and called in the act of you know of adultery and uh you know and moses said she ought to be stoned what do you say you see what i'm saying a friend of centers and wine baglets what what what's wrong with you brother and sister we can get so sanctified and so holy that we don't want nothing to do with those that are down and now and that's what happens to the you know people forget what the lord where the lord brought him from forget what the lord done for them praise god they forget when god found them where they were you know but we could we should never forget what the lord has done for us and where he bought us from we should never forget that we always should be appreciated that god reached down to the lords he said i didn't call you because you were so holy and so righteous i didn't call you because you were greater than normal i didn't call you because you were so intelligent oh but god called you because of his grace and his mercy he chose us amen so he says here not his cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were what you know sometimes we can put on a good show out front it's just like a white supplicant but the end one is full of dead men moan folk can put on a good show a good outward show look all pious and all holy but in their heart it's full of wickedness are you with me see we can look holy in front of everybody and look sanctified and look so uh righteous but if our heart is not right in the inside amen our actions gonna determine amen what's in our hearts are you with me so what's down in your heart it's gonna come out for under out of the abundancy of the heart the mouth was what speak are you with me so you end up speaking what's in your heart oh i didn't mean that certainly you didn't praise god i know peter said lord i never deny you and jesus said get behind me say sometimes satan can get in you but he don't not to be in you just it'll not be his house are you with me satan ought to be all tonight you know just dwell there all the time sometimes we can have a disposition that our disposition is not a loving disposition it's not easily to be entreated are you with me so we ought to have something uh seasoned with salt and we ought to be able to draw he said if i be lifted up by what i draw all men with love and kindness have you what yeah god does that not with this psychology intellectual conception but with simplicity amen not trying to be phony or educated and know what to say because you've learned it in theology school amen it's something that you are you know you don't have to teach us sheep how to grow war are you with me i want you to grow wool and you know i want you to go to uh college and get your phd and how to grow war are you with me so you we cannot teach you how to be christian you are christians because you are by nature by his divine nature because you've been born again and you are new creation in christ jesus because jesus christ resides and lives inside of you that makes you a son or daughter of god so your home so you all automatically you bring forth the fruits amen of the spirit now oh boy how can i get where i want to go let's go to revelation 12. okay we saw kane kane attributes he showed what he was you know somebody said well the children are the wicked one they ain't here no more well the bible says at the end so the enemy that sold the tares was the devil isn't that right revelation uh 12 and 9 let's just say let's just go to seventh verse revelation 12 and 7. it says and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not was their place found anymore in heaven are you with me see the devil come down to the earth amen he lost his position in heaven because he wanted to take over up there and because he wanted to get his pride he wanted to take over when god has positioned a place you've given you a position in him you must thank him for what he's given you and don't try to take some what god gave somebody else envy and jealousy as cruel as the grave are you look man so don't you try to take somebody else's position because somebody else can sing you're gonna take voice a lesson amen god i got a thing like that somebody else can preach like this or teach oh i gotta go i can do it too i can do it better we're not in competition gives each and every one the measure of faith and gifts according to his own will are you with me if god has made you more intelligent than me thank god i can use that you're my brother amen if i need some of your intelligence i'm going to action because i know where to get that part from are you with me glad i got a brother that got it glad i got a sister that can do it oh you look man so instead of being happy for one another sometimes we become envious and jealous and that's what cain's spirit was all about he hated his brother because his this this stuff was evil you know he was evil amen don't let us not get jealous of one another and envision one another see we can thank all kind of thoughts oh listen all that don't let the devil play with your mind forget about it i love my brother okay so he says um fault he said in the eighth verse he says 12-8 he said and prevailed not neither was the fine place anymore in heaven so the ninth verse and the great dragon was what was cast out the old that old what serpent called what i wonder who's who sold the tares the devil sold it isn't that right wonder who talked to eve in the garden that old serpent isn't that right so who got see the serpent was just like uh uh one of the cattle on the field and even more subtle than every beast he wasn't a reptile he was a beast see what i'm saying that's why the beasts in the beginning and the beasts in the end would be the same one the mark of the beast they put a mark upon cain isn't that right so uh the beast in the beginning would be the beast in the end and the mark of the beast that was on king would be the mark of the beast at the end time are you with me so we are in that age where things are coming together there's a united time and sign and everything is coming to unite amen so we we're uniting with him the word praise god the head and the body is coming together are you with me your headship has come to connect with the body which is the bride which is the wife the husband and the wife of one jesus is the head of the body and the body is the church amen isn't that right and there must be a connection amen praise god but you know israel the jews rejected their headship the head came to the body amen the messiah came and they said he's not our king amen they said he he's a devil he's reasonable are you with me when they rejected him then he turned to the gentiles isn't that right so by the grace of god now amen there's a rejection again he come to the church and the church put him out and then they ought to see he's on the outside knocking on the door and they won't let him in why they're too busy in their intellectualism they meant they already got it all out playing out and all worked out and they know how to get to heaven just like they built a tower to help them are you with me so people are building their own tower their own ideas it's a mass chaos and confusion are you with me but in the midst of the chaos and the confusion they still want to come together and say let us be one in the midst of chaos isn't that a babylon amen oh god so he says the ninth verse again it says and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called what and satan which what deceived who come on are you so smart you so intelligent you so whole and so right he deceives the what whole world amen so i'm gonna tell you the bible says he had to shorten the days for the election amen he said if it was apostle he'd deceive even the very lack isn't that right so aren't you glad god shot in the days for your sake amen god came by to get you in due time amen he knew that this was the season in hour he knew that oh god he held everything back how the four wins by that he could get his elect gather his leg from the four corners of the earth are you with me so i'm so glad god held everything up for me that jesus christ when i can recognize that the savior jesus christ has shedded his blood for me that he died for me and i could accept that thing praise god i could have went on through life and never accepted jesus christ amen his mercy and his grace for my life but thank god for his grace i got a lot to say but i got to cut his show i said i got to cut it real short today all all right tonight i think y'all can digest this and going on steady description just get a solo on the six let me go give give another scripture why josh is doing that okay genesis 6 genesis 6 while josh getting ready and caleb genesis 6 and he says oh boy i got all what kind of scriptures but i can't give them all are y'all with me but and it came to pass when men began to multiply in the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took unto them wives all of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit will not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came unto the daughters of men and they bear to them the bad children to them the same became mighty men men which were of old men are renowned and god saw that the wickedness of man remember amen the children of the wicked women the wickedness of man was great in the earth dealing with wicked men i'm going to tell you y'all know this is a wicked world it's wicked man to kill you just you don't mean nothing they said i'll blow you away they don't care there's so many hideous crimes and stuff people are doing little babies they don't care nothing about children no no women don't even care nothing about themselves they're doing any kind of evil wicked stuff if god didn't come by and save you you will be one of we were one of them but god knew that that's oh hallelujah his love for us came and got us because he knew that we would hear his voice he said he that has an ear to hear thank god that we could hear amen okay he says every imagination and thought of his heart was only what evil what now you wonder what's going on i don't understand why people yeah i understand some of them just the enemy has children the devil had children on the earth children are the wicked one and they're children of god and you test them out see what they receive god's word you know tell you to be a rough name to be married to somebody and they actually they don't want god at all they don't want nothing to do with god wouldn't that mean something see what happened the people they saw the uh daughters of men they saw that they were beautiful and they went out the beautiful beauty instead of without a god after godliness amen we better go after godliness instead of beauty because that's where that's what happened to the days of noah that's why god destroyed the world are you with me so we're getting back he said as it was in the days of sodom and as it was in the days of noah thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed at this time we're we're back there again history repeating itself at the end of the world again it won't be water but fire next time we're right there brother sister friend can't you see amen can't you see that we have come back to the same uh oh lord this is the word of god to the people of god get ready to get out of here this world is not our home we don't have nothing here praise god let's get in christ let's recognize that he loves us and he's given us a way of means of escape that we can have peace you know i thought about you know i i was reading the scripture this morning you know for my scripture and then it said something about joy i said god that's what god wants you to have joy the joy of my salvation the joy of being saved i said am i really do not really have joy you know sometimes we have to look at ourselves and see what do i really have joy we say the joy of the lord is my strength do i really have joy amen then if i if i'm not really living a life with of happiness and joy and peace and you know the bible said the kingdom of heaven is not mean to drain but it's righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost ain't that right but you see you know so many people they don't have joy amen that's why they go to the world and they go to drinking go to uh getting high they want joy it makes them laugh a little while make them forget about their troubles and their problems for a little while but once they come off the high they're still down so they want to go back i don't want to live in this world because it's no peace i don't i'm not happy are you with me but he said my peace i give you not as the world guilt amen he said i give you joy unspeakable and full of glory but we find so many people amen that says i'm a christian but they don't have the joy they don't have the peace they're not happy to be christian they're not even saying i love you lord i thank you lord amen all you've got to do is express to him how much you appreciate him saving you be thankful to him and bless his name amen oh that's what we read we read that last night too um when our lesson c can i show y'all what we read at home last night i think and then i think i read something this morning too that's where they struck me again he says make a joyful annoyance unto the lord all ye land serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with thanksgiving given amen see it said make a joyful noise and that that's what that's what it's all about psalms 100. and that's what you know black people used to come to church and they were so happy they were running to get to church why because people ain't had no money i'm gonna tell you four were pope and they were glad to get the church because that's one place they got they could come they didn't have enough money to do this and money to do that but they can come to church and they can put their nicholas and dimes in the oven or they look dollar bills and they feel good and glad to serve the lord amen because they work hard sun up the sun down in the fields and work hard and on these jobs and they they just had they battle could make it but one thing they could do get in the house of the lord and let this pressure off and enjoy the law now people got so much money that came praise the lord they got so much money they're just relaxing they almost said god you ought to worship me we're not
