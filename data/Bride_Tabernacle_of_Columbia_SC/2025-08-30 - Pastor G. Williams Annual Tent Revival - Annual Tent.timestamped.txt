[41:17] We We want to have a little testimony
[41:20] service for a minute. They ask Sister
[41:22] Hannah. She almost didn't get here, but
[41:25] she she's here. And God has these signs
[41:29] shall follow them that believe
[41:31] &gt;&gt; in my name. They shall lay hands on the
[41:34] sick and they shall recover.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; And God has used her and a lot of
[41:40] testimonies in India and Africa and
[41:43] different places and down in Florida. A
[41:45] lot of miracles and signs and wonders. I
[41:49] said just share a little bit
[41:52] of the testimonies how God has blessed
[41:55] her. Not to be a preacher, but just to
[42:00] be a believer.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Sisters could be inspired. You can be
[42:04] believers
[42:05] &gt;&gt; and God can bless you for just being the
[42:07] believer. Sister Hannah Mirage,
[42:11] come.
[42:13] [Applause]
[42:14] [Music]
[42:21] God bless you all.
[42:25] I'm so happy to be in the house of the
[42:26] Lord today.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; I give God all the glory.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; He deserve all the praise.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; He's the God of miracles.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; All my life, I've seen the supernatural.
[42:41] As a little kid growing up in this
[42:42] message,
[42:44] and I thank the Lord.
[42:47] I have thousands of testimony, church. I
[42:49] can write volumes and volumes what I've
[42:52] seen my God do
[42:54] &gt;&gt; because he's real.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Take him off the Bible.
[43:00] That's what I saw. I'll just share a
[43:02] few.
[43:05] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[43:07] We had a trip to go to India
[43:11] and we didn't know we needed a visa to
[43:13] go to India.
[43:15] So when we went to the airport, it's a
[43:16] long testimony, but I'll be very short.
[43:19] When we went to the airport, the lady
[43:21] said, "You all need a visa to go to
[43:22] India." We said, "No." She said, "Yes,
[43:23] you all." So, they booked another flight
[43:25] for us to go to Dubai. So, we went there
[43:28] and we we had to go to the Indian
[43:32] consulate over there. They said it will
[43:34] take 4 days to get the visa, 48 hours
[43:37] actually. And that was Thursday. We
[43:40] needed to fly out on Friday. Me and my
[43:43] husband, we got together and we prayed
[43:44] because the services were Saturday.
[43:46] Friday, Saturday. and we had to have
[43:49] connecting flights
[43:51] and the people said, "No, you know where
[43:52] you can get this visa because it it you
[43:55] would have to wait until Monday." We put
[43:58] it in the hand of the Lord. We prayed
[44:01] and we went to bed. The next morning,
[44:04] the visa appeared on my husband's phone.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[44:12] We boo our we we went downstairs. We
[44:15] printed a visa. We reached to India. I'm
[44:19] here and they pull me aside. My husband
[44:21] is there. We weren't together. And the
[44:24] immigration officer is watching at the
[44:26] visa. He searched his entire system.
[44:29] They have no visa.
[44:32] They didn't he said we didn't issue this
[44:34] visa. How did you get this visa?
[44:38] Then they questioning my husband in the
[44:40] other side. This they call all the
[44:42] immigration officers around us, you
[44:44] know, like we were some we came there
[44:45] illegal. But we know Jesus sent us
[44:47] there.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; So they went inside and they they called
[44:51] the head of the immigration and this the
[44:53] guy said, "Ma'am, where did you get?" I
[44:55] said, "You all issued this." He said,
[44:56] "No, it's not in our system. We didn't
[44:59] give you this." So when they called the
[45:00] head of the immigration, he said, "This
[45:02] is our stamp, but it's not in the
[45:04] system." He said, "Just let them go and
[45:07] we were free.
[45:10] Jesus gave us the visa."
[45:13] [Applause]
[45:15] What a mighty God we serve.
[45:22] And it was just miracles upon miracles
[45:24] upon miracles. When the brother saw it
[45:26] said, "You all came through." I said,
[45:28] "Jesus brought us through."
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Then another testimony while we in
[45:33] Africa while I was walking out the
[45:35] church, my husband was praying for the
[45:37] sick and I was just there. We're
[45:38] walking. We had a lots and lots and lots
[45:41] of testimonies. And this young girl, she
[45:44] laid on the floor. Her whole leg was
[45:46] broken.
[45:48] Apparently, a truck crushed her leg. And
[45:51] the doctors tried to put the bones
[45:52] together, but there's no way they could
[45:54] put the bones together. She was in so
[45:56] much pain and she was in a crutch.
[46:00] And they said, "Sister Hannah, can you
[46:02] pray for her?"
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Church, I stand here and I tell you
[46:06] nothing but the truth.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I went to my knees
[46:10] and I started to cry out to the Lord. I
[46:12] said, "Lord, you created these bones.
[46:15] The doctors cannot find the pieces
[46:17] together because there's splinters all
[46:19] over her legs and she's in such pain.
[46:21] She can't bear the pain anymore."
[46:24] And there was cuts all over. They tried
[46:26] to put it together, but there's no way
[46:28] they could have done it. I said, "God,
[46:30] you still the God that create can create
[46:32] a bone."
[46:34] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, she's like my little
[46:36] daughter's kneel. I'm kneeling here and
[46:38] I'm asking you just to put the bones
[46:40] back together. Father,
[46:42] &gt;&gt; I know I've seen you done it already and
[46:44] I know you're going to do it again.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; A few months after we came back and the
[46:49] pastor over there called me.
[46:51] He said, "Sister Hannah, the doctor
[46:53] called her." Something that they never
[46:56] ever would do in Africa
[46:58] because that would happened two years
[47:00] ago. The accident was about two years
[47:02] ago. And a few weeks after I prayed,
[47:04] they said, "We want to smile. we want to
[47:07] see this child. So they call her in the
[47:09] hospital and they saw all the bones are
[47:12] perfect in her leg. Every piece of bone
[47:16] was put back together
[47:19] [Music]
[47:20] and she was walking and leaping and
[47:22] praising God
[47:24] because Jesus put the bones back
[47:26] together.
[47:28] That's the God I serve.
[47:32] He is mighty in battle.
[47:39] And the pastor called me. He said,
[47:40] "Sister Hannah, I want to tell you
[47:42] something." He said, "Every bone is
[47:45] perfect in her body,
[47:47] &gt;&gt; and she's walking and praising the
[47:49] Lord."
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; A sister flew from Boston to my house
[47:55] &gt;&gt; a few days ago
[47:58] and she said, "Sister Hannah, I have a
[48:00] problem in my Well, she didn't tell me
[48:01] what it was. She said, "It's hepatitis
[48:03] B." She said, "My liver is damaged."
[48:06] And I put my hand on her body. I said,
[48:08] "Father,
[48:10] you're still the same yesterday, today,
[48:12] and forever."
[48:14] &gt;&gt; She called me yesterday. She said, "I'm
[48:16] perfect. My liver is perfect."
[48:20] &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't have any more
[48:22] problems."
[48:25] She had two tumors on her on her thyroid
[48:27] that she was due for surgery and she
[48:29] couldn't swallow. But she had the
[48:31] problem with her liver for 22 years. She
[48:34] said,
[48:36] she said she couldn't eat any and
[48:37] anything, but she said she's so perfect.
[48:39] So she sent me a prayer cloth before she
[48:41] came to Florida because she couldn't
[48:43] travel.
[48:45] And I didn't know what it was for. And
[48:46] she said when she got the clo church,
[48:48] I'm nobody, okay?
[48:50] &gt;&gt; I'm just a sinner saved by grace.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And I love the Lord with all my heart.
[48:57] when you see me praising my Jesus, I
[48:59] have a reason why.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; He's been so good to me. She said, I
[49:06] just took the cloth in the envelope and
[49:08] I just put it on my neck and I was
[49:10] perfectly whole. The tumors disappeared
[49:13] from her neck.
[49:16] [Applause]
[49:18] She heard the testimony about the visa
[49:21] and she has she wanted her green card
[49:26] &gt;&gt; for 17 years. She said she called me.
[49:28] She said, "Can you pray for me?" Because
[49:30] she heard so many testimonies about
[49:32] green cards and there was another
[49:35] incident. A sister was stuck in Haiti
[49:37] and the brother called me. She said,
[49:39] "Can you pray for me?" I said, "Lord, I
[49:41] don't know where Haiti is. They closed
[49:43] the airport, but I'm pointing to some
[49:45] direction. Open the airport for that
[49:47] sister to come out. Church, the next
[49:50] day, the government opened the airport.
[49:52] The sister flew out
[49:55] and then they closed the airport back.
[49:58] What a mighty God.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; And this sister heard about these
[50:08] testimonies and she wanted her green
[50:09] card. My God,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And she called me. She said, "My
[50:14] daughter is going to France and I have
[50:16] to go to get my She said, "If they call
[50:18] me for an interview," I said, "Sister,
[50:22] they're not going to call you for an
[50:23] interview, but it's mandatory with this
[50:25] new government, you have to have an
[50:28] interview and fingerprint before you get
[50:30] your green card." And while you're going
[50:31] through the process, most of the time
[50:33] they arrest you.
[50:36] And she said, "The the police are
[50:38] breaking the people's houses and just
[50:40] arresting them in the neighborhood.
[50:42] She's seen it." And she was so scared.
[50:44] She said, "Can you pray?" I said,
[50:45] "Sure." I said, "Do you believe?" She
[50:48] said, "Yes, I believe."
[50:51] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord Jesus." That was a
[50:53] Thursday. Now, she wanted this green
[50:54] card 17 years.
[50:57] That's just recently, a couple weeks
[50:59] ago.
[51:01] She said, I said, "Lord,
[51:03] let your will be done." She's not going
[51:06] to get no interview and she's going to
[51:08] get that green card.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Church, that was Thursday.
[51:14] Sunday, the immigration stamped her
[51:17] green card. Now, they don't work on
[51:18] Sundays, okay? But Jesus speed it up.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; 3 days time she had her green card.
[51:27] Three days time the impossible became
[51:30] possible.
[51:32] [Applause]
[51:35] She said, she showed me the card. She
[51:38] said, "The attorney said, "I don't know
[51:39] what happened. This does not happen
[51:41] because you're supposed to go for an
[51:43] interview and you're supposed to get
[51:44] your fingerprint, but they p bypass
[51:47] everything and they mailed you your
[51:48] green card because Jesus was there and
[51:51] working on her behalf."
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I just thank the Lord.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; I've seen cancer disappeared. When
[51:57] doctors gave them up, cancer just
[51:59] disappeared. I see God created kidneys.
[52:02] The foot just stretched out. You name
[52:05] it. I can tell you God still creates.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; I'll stop with this one.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; I was in need of a piece of fabric
[52:14] because I do interior decorating.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; And my worker was with me standing next
[52:20] to me and I was short of a I think a
[52:21] yard and 3 in or so. She said, "Mama."
[52:25] She calls me mama. She said, "What you
[52:28] going to do?" because the job was due in
[52:30] the morning and there's no nobody has
[52:32] this fabric. It was the last of the
[52:33] fabric I bought.
[52:36] I said I know someone who can create
[52:39] [Music]
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I've seen him created before before my
[52:43] eyes. I've seen him created stuff.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, you know what I need." I
[52:48] didn't pray church. I said, "Lord, you
[52:50] know what I need." And we saw the fabric
[52:52] stretched in front of our eyes.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Literally stretched in front of our
[52:58] eyes.
[53:00] to the exact amount of inches that we
[53:03] needed.
[53:06] And she started shaking like a leaf. She
[53:08] said, "Mama, God is real."
[53:11] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, he is real.
[53:15] My God is real."
[53:20] Another another incident. This is my
[53:22] last one. Forgive me. Another incident.
[53:26] Some believers came in the shop and they
[53:28] asked for prayer. They were just coming
[53:29] in. People were just coming in for
[53:30] prayer
[53:32] &gt;&gt; and the presence of the Lord just filled
[53:34] my place
[53:37] &gt;&gt; and I needed a vase. I had gone to Miami
[53:39] and I forgot to buy the vase,
[53:42] a specific vase
[53:44] and she said, "Mom, you forgot to buy
[53:46] the vase." I say, "Yes, honey. I forgot
[53:47] to buy the vase." I said, "But the Lord
[53:49] knows."
[53:50] And after I prayed for the sister and
[53:52] she was totally healed, that little
[53:55] voice say, "Didn't you say you wanted a
[53:57] vase?"
[54:00] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, Lord, I needed a vase. I
[54:03] needed so bad."
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And Esther was right there. There was no
[54:09] face there. And out of thin air, a vase
[54:12] appeared in front of our eyes.
[54:16] He's the same God that created
[54:18] squirrels.
[54:22] He can give you anything you need.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; These eyes have seen that.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; These eyes have seen the miraculous.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; All I said, "Father, you know what I
[54:36] need."
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And there came the vase in front of my
[54:39] eyes.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; I'm so humbled to be here tonight.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; I give God all the praise, all the
[54:47] honor, and all the glory.
[54:50] He deserve it.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; I love the Lord with all my heart. God
[54:55] bless you all.
[54:57] [Applause]
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:08] [Music]
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[55:12] you hear things like that. You said,
[55:14] "Let me check up and see." I said,
[55:16] "Okay, let's check. Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Says, "Pastor Simmons,
[55:23] we've been knowing one another for a
[55:25] long time."
[55:28] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; I said it's real. Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; If you can believe.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; All things are possible
[55:40] &gt;&gt; to them that believe.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; I trust that you believe tonight.
[55:46] Trust that you want something from God,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, that the impossible is possible.
[55:52] [Music]
[55:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to ask Bishop
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Adrien Green to come and

[56:43] And what long could God fill the church
[56:45] right?
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So by the grace of God, we thank
[56:49] God for him being faithful.

[57:58] blood still has power.
[58:01] Hallelujah.
[58:04] Hallelujah.
[58:06] Amen. I tried to sneak in the back. I

[58:45] wife, and I'm glad about it. Hallelujah.
[58:49] Anybody filled with the Holy Ghost in
[58:51] here? I'm going to ask again. Anybody
[58:54] filled with the Holy Ghost?
[58:56] If you're satisfied with Jesus, just
[58:59] find three people and tell them, "I'm
[59:00] satisfied."
[59:03] Come on, find three people and tell
[59:05] them, "I'm satisfied.
[59:08] If it had not been for the Lord who was
[59:11] on my side.
[59:14] I'm satisfied.
[59:16] I said, "I'm satisfied.
[59:18] I come too far to turn around. I'm
[59:22] satisfied."
[59:26] Amen. I feel him in my heart. But can we
[59:29] search a minute? Living, he loved me.
[59:32] Dying, he saved me. carried. He carried
[59:36] my sins far away. And wasn't he

[1:06:47] the ditch. He said, he said, "You going
[1:06:48] to be a preacher?"
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And he called me Rev. And that stuck all

[1:11:20] book of St. John the 4th chapter.
[1:11:24] I want to begin reading at the first
[1:11:27] verse.
[1:11:29] When therefore the Lord knew how the
[1:11:32] Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and
[1:11:35] baptized more disciples than John,
[1:11:38] though Jesus himself baptized not but
[1:11:42] his disciples, he he left Judea and
[1:11:45] departed again into Galilee. And he met
[1:11:49] and he must need go through Samaria.
[1:11:52] Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,
[1:11:55] which is called Sincar, near to the plot
[1:12:00] or the portion of ground that Jacob gave
[1:12:04] to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was
[1:12:07] there. And Jesus therefore being weary
[1:12:11] with his journey, sat by the by the wall
[1:12:15] or by the well, and it was about the
[1:12:18] sixth hour. There cometh a woman of
[1:12:21] Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said
[1:12:24] unto her, "Give me to drink." Father
[1:12:28] God, we thank you tonight for your love.
[1:12:31] We thank you, oh God, for being in this

[1:12:54] Bible and I read your word. But God, we
[1:12:56] know it takes you to come to break bread
[1:12:58] of life to our hearts. So tonight, oh
[1:13:00] God, we implore you now, Lord. Um that

[1:38:49] situation is. Uh no matter where you
[1:38:51] are. Amen. Uh God can meet you right
[1:38:54] there. Amen. Uh and he'll bring her to

[1:41:42] want to stick with a man satisfying uh
[1:41:44] amen the thirst of your spiritual thirst
[1:41:47] of your soul. Amen. So don't let the

[1:42:17] God got what you need. Uh come to him.
[1:42:19] Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Coming up, there used to be a you know a
[1:42:27] tele evangel healer, Reverend Ike.
[1:42:32] And Reverend I had this little prayer
[1:42:34] prayer cloth
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; and he said, "You know, you can't lose
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; with the stuff I use."
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Well, my grandmother,
[1:42:45] sister grandmother Flora Leette,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; she say I'm going to write back to him
[1:42:51] and tell him that he can't lose with the
[1:42:53] stuff I use.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:42:57] And I and I believe if there had to be a
[1:42:59] showdown,
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; we'd have had another Elijah showdown
[1:43:05] that Reverend I could have called all he
[1:43:07] wanted what he had, it would have never
[1:43:09] answer.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; But my grandmother, Amen, who had a
[1:43:13] stroke, amen, and they say she weren't
[1:43:15] going to walk. Uh, but she say, "I'm
[1:43:17] going to walk again." Amen. Uh, and all
[1:43:19] grandmother got that place. Amen. She
[1:43:21] walked again. Amen. I said, "Lord, why?"
[1:43:23] Because the stuff she used, Amen. Amen.
[1:43:26] was able to bring a result. Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; I remember coming up. We used to had to,
[1:43:32] you know, uh put uh water on the radio.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Get your water, put it on the radio. And
[1:43:39] we put the water on the radio and uh and
[1:43:41] had jugs and everything. Uh pull the
[1:43:43] radio, had weighed it down with all kind
[1:43:45] of water. We had it sitting around. We
[1:43:47] Oh, I'm hurting her. Drink some water.
[1:43:53] He want the water.
[1:43:55] It wasn't the water.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; It was the faith we had in it.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; It was the faith we had in it. Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; So I say, why try all of those things
[1:44:06] up?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Try Jesus.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Look to him. Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Look to him. Amen. Uh who going to raise
[1:44:13] all of your midnights? Amen. Uh who can
[1:44:16] call back the sunlight. Amen. Uh amen.
[1:44:18] Bring you back to the place. Amen. Uh as
[1:44:20] though you never did it in the first
[1:44:22] place. Amen. That's God. Amen. through
[1:44:24] his justification. Amen. But we find now
[1:44:26] so uh so she tried to quench it in other
[1:44:28] ways. Amen. So certain Satan all he
[1:44:30] wants to do is pervert.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; He wants to pervert
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; the satisfying portion that God want us
[1:44:37] to have. Amen. So he tried to pervert.
[1:44:40] Amen. Uh the satisfying of your soul.
[1:44:42] Amen. Uh with something of the world,
[1:44:45] something that that's partial. Amen. But
[1:44:48] we are tired of partial realization.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; I want full realization in this hour. I
[1:44:53] don't want that anymore. So, David began
[1:44:55] to cry out, and this is my my cry when
[1:44:58] I'm talking about satisfying uh the
[1:45:00] spiritual thirst of my soul. David said
[1:45:03] in Psalms 42, uh, "As the heart painth
[1:45:06] after the water broke,
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; so painth my soul after thee, oh God,
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; then he went on and brought this in."
[1:45:13] Amen. Uh, my soul thirsteth for God, the
[1:45:17] living God. Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; When shall I come in and appear before
[1:45:22] my God? Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And we find out so when David was
[1:45:26] writing this. Amen. David was in a in a
[1:45:28] in a place of distress.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; David was in a place of distress. Amen.
[1:45:34] And you know sometime uh distress when
[1:45:36] it comes Amen. Uh it makes us a better
[1:45:38] person. Amen. Uh Amen. We can call the
[1:45:40] distress. Amen. Desperation. Amen. Uh
[1:45:43] and sometime desperation uh has to sink
[1:45:45] in. Amen. Uh before we get to moving for
[1:45:48] God. Amen. Uh it shouldn't be that way
[1:45:50] but that's how it has to be. Amen. So
[1:45:52] here come David. Amen. Uh in this
[1:45:54] despair place. Amen. So the last part
[1:45:57] begin to write. He say uh my tears have
[1:46:00] been my meat day and night.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; While they continually say unto me,
[1:46:04] where is thy God?
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Where is thy God? All this you speak of.
[1:46:09] Amen. When I remember these things, I
[1:46:12] pour out my soul in me. For I had gone
[1:46:16] with the multitude. Uh I went with them
[1:46:19] to the house of God.
[1:46:21] with the voice of joy and praise with a
[1:46:23] multitude uh that kept holy day.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; I played church.
[1:46:28] I went sat on the pew.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; I listened up. But nothing was
[1:46:33] happening. Amen. Uh there was something
[1:46:35] that was still that was etching at my
[1:46:37] soul. Uh and though I went with the
[1:46:39] mother to but still I needed something
[1:46:42] else. Amen.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; I needed something else. Amen. Uh and
[1:46:45] David say, "Oh, why cast down oh my
[1:46:49] soul?
[1:46:50] And why art thou disqued in me?
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Hope in God,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; for I shall yet praise him uh for the
[1:46:58] help of his cultiness.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; So when so when God appears, when God
[1:47:03] come on the scene, Amen. Uh he'll take
[1:47:05] away that thirst. Amen.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Because he's the soul satisfier.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; So I said, Lord, help us in this hour.
[1:47:11] Amen. So there was David, amen,
[1:47:13] meditating, David, uh amen, agonizing,
[1:47:16] David, uh in despair. David in
[1:47:18] desperation. Amen. Uh and begin to cry
[1:47:20] out, "Lord, where are you, Lord?" Uh I
[1:47:22] need that living God. Uh I don't want a
[1:47:24] historical God. Uh I want a living God.
[1:47:26] Amen. Uh don't tell me a tale. Uh give
[1:47:28] me the true God. Amen.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; That's what David wanted. Amen. He
[1:47:32] wanted something to satisfy
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; that spiritual thirst. Amen.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; And David even later on knew how it was
[1:47:41] to be without that.
[1:47:43] David say, "Oh Lord,
[1:47:46] take not thy holy spirit away from me."
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; He come to the place he say, "But
[1:47:54] restore."
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Restore
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; unto me the joy of thy salvation. Amen.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; He knew how it was. Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; To be without the true living God. Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; But here we see this woman in John 4.
[1:48:08] Amen. Amen. And this is where we must
[1:48:10] come to. Amen. When Jesus told her,
[1:48:13] amen, uh that the water that she was
[1:48:15] seeking, amen,
[1:48:17] she would thirst again.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; All that I might be doing out in the
[1:48:22] world, amen, uh it's not going to
[1:48:24] satisfy my soul.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; All that I you know, and you know, and
[1:48:28] this is not just for those that are,
[1:48:30] this is this is everybody. Amen. Uh even
[1:48:32] those that are in church, amen. Uh
[1:48:34] sometime we are not where we need to be.
[1:48:36] Amen. Uh we still have a longing in our
[1:48:38] soul uh that we need to see God. Amen.
[1:48:41] Uh
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; so we find amen. So uh so so that
[1:48:44] whatever I'm using, Amen. Uh Amen. It's
[1:48:47] not going to last always
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; until I get him the true living God.
[1:48:52] Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; So we find Jesus said to her,
[1:48:55] "Whatsoever
[1:48:56] what whosoever drinketh of this water,
[1:48:59] the things that you using to cover up
[1:49:01] that thirst, amen, you're going to
[1:49:02] thirst again."
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You're going to get up tomorrow and
[1:49:05] still have that longing in your heart.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; You know, at one time I often wonder
[1:49:10] People go out, they drink,
[1:49:13] they smoke teacher,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; and then they get up next day hangover,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; head hurting.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; I'm like, why in the world you do it
[1:49:23] for?
[1:49:25] I say, let me tell you this. I can get
[1:49:27] high on
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; I can get drunk
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; and I don't even have a hangover.
[1:49:35] All I want is more. But you get yours.
[1:49:38] Amen. So you can't go the next day.
[1:49:40] Amen. Why? Because it doesn't satisfy.
[1:49:42] Amen. But when we get a hold of the real
[1:49:45] thing. Amen. Uh it bring us satisfaction
[1:49:47] to our soul. Amen. So this woman now, so
[1:49:50] here she is asking this question and
[1:49:52] Jesus said now and she said now unto
[1:49:54] her, if thou knowest the gift of God
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; that thirst that you something that's
[1:50:00] longer. Amen. I reminded if there is in
[1:50:04] there something calling for more of God
[1:50:06] then there's more God out there for you.
[1:50:08] Amen. Uh don't settle for just the
[1:50:10] mediocre. Don't settle for a substitute.
[1:50:13] Amen. Uh get what's real. Amen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; So say if you know the gift of God
[1:50:19] who it is that speaketh or sith to thee
[1:50:22] give me drink thou would have asked of
[1:50:24] him and he will give thee. Amen. Oh. He
[1:50:27] will give thee a living water.
[1:50:31] Not stagnated stuff,
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; but living water. Amen.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; But whosoever drinkketh of the water
[1:50:37] that I give him uh sh and shall never
[1:50:40] thirst. Amen. I said, Lord, it's
[1:50:42] resolved now. Amen. That's the water I
