[37:06] deliver Lord those that have need of

[37:14] for whatever it is that we standing in
[37:17] need of you know Lord forgive us oh God
[37:20] and move flesh back out of the way that
[37:23] the spirit might have preeminence your
[37:26] word might oh God be fulfilled in our
[37:30] lives in Jesus name
[37:33] amen the book of St
[37:36] Luke
[37:39] 23 we we're just ministering the series
[37:42] The Devil didn't
[37:46] know and do you
[37:49] know but this
[37:52] morning forgive
[37:55] them
[37:57] as you turn I just read the 32nd verse
[38:00] it and there were also two others male
[38:05] factors led with him to be put to
[38:10] death the 33
[38:13] says and when they were come to a place
[38:16] which is called what
[38:20] Calvary
[38:22] there they
[38:25] what
[38:27] the prophet of God in in indictment says
[38:30] There They Crucified him
[38:35] amen and the male factors one on the
[38:39] right hand and the other on the
[38:42] left then said
[38:45] Jesus father what for them Father
[38:50] forgive them for
[38:52] they what
[38:54] they and they departed his garments and
[38:57] cast lots amen God bless you may be
[39:04] seated now if you were an onlooker and
[39:09] you were
[39:10] there I wonder what would your response
[39:15] be did they actually
[39:18] know what they were
[39:22] doing did they actually
[39:25] un
[39:27] did they understand the magnitude of
[39:29] what was going
[39:31] on for it was prophesized they cast
[39:38] lots what they were doing they were
[39:40] fulfilling scripture unconsciously and
[39:45] unaware they were doing what the word
[39:48] had said that they would
[39:53] do our lives were're not here
[39:57] just by coincidence we have a purpose
[40:02] and God allowed us to be born in this
[40:05] world it's a reason why God
[40:09] alive for he said he made some vessels
[40:12] to honor and some to
[40:17] dishonor but those vessels to
[40:21] honor you have a
[40:25] purpose
[40:27] some would be sheep and others would be
[40:31] goat some would be wheat and others
[40:34] would be
[40:36] tear are you with
[40:39] me some will be saved and some will
[40:43] refuse to accept
[40:46] salvation some would be
[40:52] lost but
[40:54] God and every individual
[40:57] gives you an
[40:59] opportunity to make a
[41:03] choice and the choice that we
[41:06] make today may be the only time that you
[41:10] would be able to make that
[41:13] choice then again you might have a
[41:17] second time a third time but one
[41:22] day you'll
[41:24] face a righteous Jud
[41:27] judge and when you face
[41:30] him I believe that we'll be without
[41:34] excuse so the choice and the decision
[41:37] that you
[41:40] make let's make the right
[41:46] decision There They Crucified
[41:50] him he chose to forgive
[41:54] them and forgive forgiveness
[41:57] signifies
[42:01] remission of The Punishment Due to the
[42:04] sinful
[42:10] conduct so
[42:13] glad that he forgave
[42:16] me are you glad he forgave
[42:20] you but some even though he forgave them
[42:25] they would not accept
[42:29] it's up to you to receive
[42:34] forgiveness for he has already forgiven
[42:39] you he's already said you are
[42:43] forgiven but if you don't want
[42:46] it then you would not have
[42:50] it father forgive
[42:54] them because they do not understand what
[42:58] they are
[43:01] doing often times when we
[43:04] were coming through life we made many
[43:07] choices that wasn't good we did many
[43:10] things that we ashamed
[43:13] of today we're ashamed of some of the
[43:16] decisions we made some of the things we
[43:22] did and we don't want to we don't have
[43:25] an opportunity
[43:27] to go back and correct those
[43:32] things but isn't it good that we have a
[43:35] God that
[43:37] says I forgive
[43:41] you I forgive
[43:43] you in spite of your bad
[43:47] decisions some of the foolish stuff we
[43:52] did God still says I love love you I
[43:57] forgive
[44:01] you I'm so glad
[44:05] now forgive
[44:07] them 1 Corinthians again two and we want
[44:11] to just take our time and look at it and
[44:16] uh just think about his
[44:20] goodness think about his love think
[44:24] about how much he cared for
[44:28] us when we
[44:31] made bad decisions yet he
[44:36] still had
[44:40] mercy he still loved
[44:44] us he could have just when you made your
[44:49] first wrong decision he could have cut
[44:52] you off right
[44:54] then when you chose to go the wrong way
[44:58] he could have said it's all over
[45:01] now yet he still says I'm
[45:05] patient I'm
[45:08] longsuffering
[45:10] amen knowing that it's appointed
[45:17] time that you would come to
[45:21] yourself you would recognize how much he
[45:24] cared the young man went away from home
[45:27] and he says in the hog pin he
[45:31] says how many high serons that my father
[45:37] have you know what I'm saying I I I
[45:40] could be in better shape than I'm in
[45:44] now but one thing he acknowledged he
[45:48] acknowledged that I got a
[45:53] father and one thing you can recognize
[45:56] that I got a
[45:57] God
[45:59] yes I got a father that I can go
[46:03] to I don't have to be in the condition
[46:05] that I'm in I can go
[46:11] home you
[46:13] see that man young man came to himself
[46:17] and he wanted to go back home for what I
[46:20] was what I
[46:23] left not knowing that I was going to get
[46:26] myself in this
[46:28] condition if he would only
[46:33] known that he was leaving the
[46:36] word to go after the
[46:39] world if he only
[46:42] knew what he was
[46:45] doing but he said father forgive them CU
[46:51] they don't understand what they
[46:53] doing are you with me
[46:58] so in um 1 Corinthians 2 here and
[47:04] five he said and your faith should not
[47:07] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[47:10] what in the power of
[47:13] God how be it we speak wisdom among them
[47:17] that are
[47:18] what are you with
[47:22] me y'all know who you talking to right
[47:25] so he's speaking wisdom to them that
[47:29] are are
[47:31] you he's speaking wisdom to them that
[47:35] are
[47:37] perfect I said the devil didn't know but
[47:40] do you
[47:41] know that God is saying I speak in
[47:44] wisdom to them that are perfect the
[47:46] Corinthian Church was a bad Church did
[47:50] all kind of stuff but here Paul says I'm
[47:53] speaking wisdom to them this this folk
[47:56] did all kind of stuff read the book of
[47:59] Corinthians but he said I'm speaking
[48:01] wisdom to them that
[48:04] are in spite
[48:07] of yet you speaking wisdom to them who
[48:11] we talking to you know you're not
[48:12] talking H you talking to me uh no
[48:16] talking who you talking to not the
[48:20] Corinthians couldn't be I speak wisdom
[48:23] to them that are what perfect yet not
[48:27] the wisdom
[48:28] of this
[48:31] world are you with
[48:33] me nor of the
[48:36] what the princes of this
[48:39] world that come to
[48:42] not but we
[48:44] speak the wisdom of God in a what in a
[48:50] mystery praise God it's it's a mystery
[48:55] uh uh to to the devil it's a
[48:58] mystery he don't he can't quite figure
[49:00] this
[49:04] out he can't see who you
[49:08] are all he sees is your
[49:12] faults all he sees is every time you
[49:15] make a mistake that's all he
[49:21] sees but I'm speaking wisdom to them
[49:23] that are perfect
[49:27] are you with
[49:29] me when we speak wisdom of God in the
[49:33] mystery even the hidden wisdom is
[49:37] here the devil blind to it if our gospel
[49:41] be he is here to them that are whom the
[49:44] God of this world has what blinded the
[49:48] mind the devil blind he can't
[49:51] see but you
[49:53] see it's given into you to know know the
[49:56] Mistress of the Kingdom ain't that right
[50:00] but I'm speaking to them in Parables
[50:02] they don't
[50:03] know are you with me I said the devil
[50:07] don't know do you
[50:11] know which God ordained before what the
[50:18] world until who who is he talking
[50:24] to I'm talk he's talking to
[50:28] me he's talking about me into my our
[50:33] Glory are you with
[50:35] me so what's going on here I want to

[50:40] reading the Bible and I don't know
[50:41] what's going on tell me what's going on
[50:45] let's

[50:57] y'all y'all want to
[50:58] believe there they crucified him and
