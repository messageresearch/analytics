[22:52] fresh away out tonight we wasn't
[22:55] listening tonight we want to just
[23:01] continue on in the message from Sunday
[23:04] morning by the grace of God and we were
[23:09] talking about the destiny of the soul
[23:13] just where our souls gonna be and how we
[23:19] stand with God it's gonna determine how
[23:25] how we identify with the word so tonight
[23:31] as we bow our heads we do want to say
[23:34] thank you again for tuning in and thank
[23:38] you for coming this morning
[23:41] father in Jesus name God you're great
[23:46] and greatly to be praised and we want to
[23:50] thank you today thank you for your blood
[23:53] that you shed it thank you for those old
[23:56] God that are praying warriors Lord and
[23:59] we thank you Lord God for Lord without
[24:04] you we can do nothing with you Lord all
[24:08] things are possible to them they believe
[24:11] and father we put our trust in you I
[24:14] should have look upon the sick in the
[24:16] trouble Lord the nation the world is in
[24:21] a turbo condition Lord
[24:24] Lord men and women don't know what to do
[24:28] what seemeth oh god they're taking the
[24:34] ease in Zion but father we know that the
[24:39] rapture is at hand
[24:41] and the coming of the Lord is close so
[24:46] father we want to prepare our hearts to
[24:48] go back with you Lord let everyone know
[24:51] God the name the name of Christ you said
[24:54] depart from iniquity so Lord as we look
[24:57] to the hills now trusting in your
[25:00] failing word of promise you know all the
[25:03] special requests you know all the needs
[25:07] lord action to look upon them Lord
[25:10] brother Barnes your brother Lord for you
[25:13] touch him today Lord the different
[25:17] Warren's an excellent prayer Lord you
[25:18] know that all them by their names in
[25:22] Jesus name we pray amen
[25:43] the father's have eaten sour grapes and
[25:46] the children teeth assetid edge as I
[25:51] live say the Lord you shall not have
[25:54] occasion anymore to use this proverb in
[25:58] Israel behold all souls are mine as the
[26:04] soul of the father saw so the soul of
[26:08] the son is mine and the soul that's in
[26:13] it it should die the destiny of the soul
[26:17] just where where is the soul headed now
[26:24] we understand that we took God's servant
[26:29] said the soul is the nature of the
[26:31] Spirit
[26:34] the book of Hebrews for we want to look
[26:38] at it from the standpoint what the word
[26:41] says here it says in the twelfth verse
[26:45] Hebrews four and twelve for the word of
[26:48] God it's quick it's powerful sharper
[26:51] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[26:55] the divine of the Sunda of the soul and
[26:58] of the spirit and of the joints in the
[27:05] marrow and is a discerner of thoughts
[27:08] and intents of the heart
[27:10] so the Word of God can reach down into
[27:15] the depths of man in and actually the
[27:19] soul of man so he said to sold that
[27:25] sentence has a destiny in the destiny of
[27:28] that soul that sentence is death and the
[27:31] Bible tells us that the wages of sin is
[27:34] death in the gift of God is eternal life
[27:38] we told on Sunday that God made man
[27:41] spirit man and Genesis 1 and then he
[27:46] next he made God a man of the dust of
[27:49] the ground breathed in his nostrils the
[27:52] breath of life and man became a living
[27:56] soul the difference between man and
[27:59] animal animal has a spirit and it has
[28:04] flesh but it doesn't have a soul but man
[28:08] has a soul and that soul that sentence
[28:12] that should die
[28:13] so we're responsible for the destiny of
[28:18] our soul then God plays us on free more
[28:22] agent you have a choice to make in the
[28:24] decision to me God told Adam and Eve
[28:29] every tree of the garden you may freely
[28:31] eat but of the tree of knowledge and
[28:33] good and evil the day you eat thereof
[28:34] that's the day you die and sometimes we
[28:39] talked about death we talked about death
[28:41] it's being separated from God we find
[28:45] that God put man out of
[28:47] a Garden of Eden and he put Charles down
[28:50] range instead of God the way to the Tree
[28:52] of Life that man couldn't get back into
[28:54] God he said Lisa eat up the tree of life
[28:58] and live forever now Jesus being the
[29:02] tree of life we eat and we live forever
[29:05] are you with me so man that sin comes to
[29:12] death ends so the soul that sinneth
[29:17] shall die well what happened to the soul
[29:20] that event that God David said thou
[29:26] restored my soul God comes to bring man
[29:31] back to God now how did they do that
[29:34] when he was telling the disciples after
[29:37] his resurrection that what to do in
[29:40] commission in them he breathed on them
[29:42] and said receive you the Holy Ghost now
[29:47] the Holy Ghost is the very nature of God
[29:50] it's a very life of God it's gooey God's
[29:54] on life so the Holy Ghost comes amen
[29:59] inside of you he meant to bring man back
[30:04] in relationship and bring back the very
[30:08] nature of God back to man because man
[30:12] nature had become corrupt are you with
[30:15] me so man in the sense had become
[30:20] corrupt sinful amen and from underneath
[30:24] and from sin amen came death by sin amen
[30:30] so by the grace of God I want to send
[30:35] all of that I want to go to some places
[30:38] here and in the book of first
[30:41] Thessalonians 5:23 first Thessalonians
[30:44] 5:23 it says here we talk about the
[30:51] gates of the inlets to the body the five
[30:55] senses taste here
[30:59] see and so forth and the five inlets of
[31:05] the five contacts to the body until the
[31:13] spirit of vice versa some said of soul
[31:16] some set of spirit and when we talk
[31:18] about reason affecting confidence and
[31:21] memory and so forth now when we talk
[31:23] about those things that deal with our
[31:26] spirit without soul then it's so that's
[31:29] one of the other faiths our unbelief
[31:32] when man went away from God that means
[31:37] he died when Eve doubted the word then
[31:40] men become deaf came in and they were
[31:45] separated from God because man had
[31:49] sinned and in the president of God man
[31:53] could not stay in the president of God
[31:56] because of sin because God is a holy God
[32:00] and God being holy man cannot stay and
[32:04] abide in the presence of God are you
[32:06] with me so man cannot stand the
[32:09] president of God because of sin that how
[32:11] can we we could come to church we can go
[32:13] through the motion he meant but of our
[32:16] soul is not right with God if in the
[32:20] inside we don't have faith in God and we
[32:23] have faith in God then he said man
[32:25] should not live by bread only alone but
[32:28] he should live by every word that
[32:30] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[32:32] so we're responsible before God to live
[32:36] by every word not just part of it every
[32:39] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[32:41] God so God has acts and you and I they
[32:44] meant to recognize he meant because Eve
[32:47] dotted one word and it caused all his
[32:49] sickness all the pain all the death
[32:51] everything they meant that we can
[32:53] imagine all our troubles all our sorrows
[32:56] is because Eve God at one word and the
[32:59] devil was able to come in amen
[33:03] Lucifer when he was in heaven he just
[33:06] the Bible says yeah the Lord has made
[33:09] all things even the wicked for the day
[33:12] of evil
[33:12] if God made all things amen but you say
[33:15] that God make the evil he said he made
[33:20] all things even the wicked because but
[33:23] we want to look at it from the
[33:25] standpoint that God made Lucifer and he
[33:28] made everything good God is the great
[33:31] fountain of love and it was not no evil
[33:35] in God but the Bible says when Lucifer
[33:40] exalted himself and the Bible text about
[33:44] the devil when he speaks to life
[33:46] speaketh of his own for he is the father
[33:48] of it God is not the author of confusion
[33:51] God did not bring make us sin I'll make
[33:55] man sinned or make the Lucifer do what
[33:58] he did
[33:58] Lucifer in his own self he had a
[34:02] decision to make
[34:03] that he wanted to take over his pride he
[34:05] got lifted up are you with me so God did
[34:09] not make him evil he became evil because
[34:12] of his own imaginations and the thoughts
[34:15] of his heart became wicked and that's
[34:19] what happens man thoughts and when God
[34:23] made man he made man wholly made Eve and
[34:26] Adam holy but he didn't make him a robot
[34:31] where he program and say do this he made
[34:35] him a mint were they free are you with
[34:38] me and because we get the Holy Ghost
[34:41] that don't mean we become we will slaves
[34:45] prisoners by our own free will we are
[34:50] Paul says I am a prisoner for the Lord
[34:52] and because I'm a prisoner amen it's
[34:57] because I I want to live this way I
[35:01] recognize this is what I chose this is
[35:05] what I want and I'm happy being this way
[35:08] amen
[35:09] because before Amen I was a slave to sin
[35:13] amen I was a slave to unrighteousness
[35:16] but now Amen I am to God amen
[35:20] I'm a prisoner to God and I love being a
[35:22] prisoner for God because I know
[35:26] amen well my destiny where I'm headed
[35:29] because I know where I was headed I was
[35:33] headed to death and I was headed to hell
[35:35] oh you wouldn't but now I have a new
[35:39] destiny a new destination a mint in
[35:42] things that ought to be a mint God serve
[35:45] it talked about it was talking about you
[35:47] and I became when God lit the fire when
[35:53] the Holy Ghost came in got a little fire
[35:55] and we became sons and daughters of God
[35:58] and then he says Amen talked about you
[36:02] and I being jeans and of God in
[36:05] attributes of God where God for Dane
[36:08] nothing before the foundation of the
[36:09] world are you with me
[36:11] so God saw that one day that you would
[36:14] make the decision he meant that you
[36:16] wanted that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:18] and when God fill you with the Holy
[36:20] Ghost he meant you lit a fire that you a
[36:25] meant became sons and daughters of God
[36:27] and you reckon I do your father was God
[36:30] and he is the worry are you with me but
[36:34] you amen you had a decision to making
[36:37] you made the right decision
[36:39] are you a man but then others have a
[36:42] decision to make but they make the wrong
[36:44] decision with you and I because your
[36:47] destiny your soul meant something it was
[36:50] valuable to you where you go to spend
[36:52] eternity was valuable it was important
[36:56] he meant some people it's not important
[36:58] they don't care if they come to church
[36:59] they don't care if they all serve the
[37:02] Lord
[37:02] they I'm telling you some people view of
[37:06] God is so I don't know it's so it's so
[37:14] chaotic it's so like a puzzle you know
[37:18] they have no concept of what God is
[37:21] requiring what God wants amen
[37:25] God amen wants you to realize the value
[37:29] of your soul amen and God has made
[37:31] provision a meant to take you where you
[37:35] need to be to get back amen from where a
[37:38] man has
[37:39] are you with me I want to get you back
[37:43] amen - what evil loss and what atom loss
[37:46] I want to take you back and I want to
[37:49] restore paradise again I want to restore
[37:52] you back to eating I wanted to restore
[37:54] you back amen to where you was before
[37:58] death came before sin came in are you
[38:02] with me so that's you on a journey
[38:05] brother and sister
[38:06] first Thessalonians 5:23 he said in 21
[38:11] he says prove all things hold fast to
[38:15] that which is good a stain from all
[38:17] appearance of evil he's saying and the
[38:20] very God of peace sanctify you wholly oh
[38:24] you the very God of peace sanctify you
[38:29] wholly you know and that's what I
[38:32] believe that God it says you know a lot
[38:37] of pastors and I need to kind of bring
[38:39] that up - he said forsake not the
[38:42] assembling yourself together the amount
[38:44] of some is amen and then we ought to
[38:47] come together even the more sin that
[38:49] what we at the time we're living in now
[38:51] with this virus and all of this is going
[38:55] on but if we can find a way it ought to
[38:57] be able discern our heart with all our
[38:59] hearts we ought to desire to come
[39:02] together because that's what a man is
[39:04] all about when two or three are gathered
[39:06] in my name there I am in the midst we
[39:08] are with all our heart desire to come
[39:11] together and as much as we can and we
[39:13] can get just six feet apart we ought to
[39:16] just do that and just do it with all our
[39:18] heart Lord I want to come if I have to
[39:20] where I'm a survivor to do this lord I
[39:22] want to come together because I want to
[39:24] fulfill your word are you with me so it
[39:28] ought to be in our heart to do what we
[39:30] can to come together are you with me so
[39:35] your soul it determines your action
[39:39] determines what your soul don't spend
[39:41] eternity well your destinies are you
[39:44] with me so he says and the 23rd verse
[39:50] for the very God of peace
[39:52] if I you holy and I pray God your whole
[39:56] spirit and soul and body be what we
[40:03] preserved blameless God wants your soul
[40:07] to be blameless he wants you to be
[40:10] blameless a church without spot or
[40:12] blemish
[40:13] any such thing that it might be holy
[40:16] amen
[40:17] God wants you to be holy God want you to
[40:20] be blameless and I God has if he's
[40:23] required that that he must make
[40:25] provision for that to be because of God
[40:29] did not provide a way for you to be
[40:31] blameless then you would have an excuse
[40:34] but God said I pray God that your whole
[40:38] body soul and spirit amen
[40:42] be preserved blameless God wants to
[40:45] preserve you blameless unto the coming
[40:48] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[40:50] he said faithful is he that called you
[40:54] who also what will also will do it God
[40:59] it's gonna do it for you amen
[41:02] he said he will do it now you just have
[41:06] to allow him to do it for you amen he
[41:12] said he will do it amen
[41:15] so brother brother and sister I want to
[41:19] go a little further to extend this out
[41:22] amen
[41:23] we talked about amen the soul amen the
[41:27] senate's it's going to die and and in
[41:30] Hebrews it was it was telling us that
[41:34] the Destiny Hebrews 9 and 27 Hebrews 9
[41:39] and 27
[41:40] I just want to teach a little bit by the
[41:44] grace of God if I can I know I'm not a
[41:48] teacher like that but by the grace of
[41:51] God we 1 9 and 27 and God is so good to
[41:55] us it's so easy for me to speed up and
[42:00] get the preaching so I want to kind of
[42:03] slow it down because I want you to think
[42:06] he meant that as much as death is real a
[42:10] meant life is even more real I'm not
[42:14] talking about this life here because
[42:16] this life is only it's not the real
[42:21] thing is just a fragment it's just a
[42:24] little taste of what life is but Zoe is
[42:28] God's own life its eternal life amen and
[42:31] we want to a met have Zoe we want to
[42:34] have God like the the kind of life that
[42:37] they had before the fall they met and
[42:39] God breathed in the knowledge they
[42:42] received the Holy Ghost I want you to
[42:44] have that life I want you to taste of
[42:46] the heavenly gift I want you to be
[42:48] partakers of the heavenly calling and
[42:51] that's what I said in Hebrews ro3 it
[42:54] says wherefore holy brethren amen
[42:57] God won't you he called your brother and
[43:00] partakers of the heavenly calling
[43:02] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[43:05] our profession Christ Jesus amen I want
[43:09] you to consider that you're partakers of
[43:12] a heavenly calling amen and God called
[43:15] you to be heavenly not earthly bound by
[43:18] heavenly bound God is taking you to a
[43:21] higher level amen he's taking you Amy
[43:25] and not like a beasts and animals but
[43:28] God and not even like a human being in
[43:30] it because when we talk about humanity
[43:33] we're not talking about divinity amen
[43:36] and when we talk about divinity we're
[43:39] talking about God nature Amite divine
[43:42] nature
[43:43] but when we talk about humanity we're
[43:45] talking about human nature amen and the
[43:48] difference between human nature in God's
[43:51] in nature
[43:52] Amen because God's nature is holy it's
[43:56] alright he meant to have morals and all
[43:59] of that but when we got to divine nature
[44:02] that's something that only comes from
[44:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost come from
[44:07] the audience self are you with me so
[44:10] it's a difference brother he meant to be
[44:13] morally good and humanely
[44:15] good and nice and do the humanly things
[44:19] because amen we will not say by works
[44:22] what we're saved by grace amen
[44:24] but it's but we are his workmanship
[44:28] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[44:31] so it is he that worketh in us both the
[44:35] will and to do of his good pleasure so
[44:38] it's not us anymore
[44:40] living but it's Christ that lives inside
[44:43] of us are you with me
[44:45] so the question lives inside of you it
[44:48] is the Christ that gives you a meant
[44:50] that kind of life that I'm talking about
[44:54] that kind of nature that was lost in the
[44:57] garden amen it's being restored back to
[45:00] the party so here we are brothers sister
[45:05] on a journey the destiny of the soul the
[45:08] value of your soul what more than ten
[45:11] thousand worlds Amen brothers sister God
[45:14] is calling you to a higher calling your
[45:17] soul is important and God wants you to
[45:20] recognize even don't take in life even
[45:24] but we take it light because we don't
[45:26] understand amen so we understand about
[45:30] church we understand about coming to
[45:33] church hearing the word singing and just
[45:36] talking all kind of nonsense thinking
[45:39] all kind of nonsense in our head who did
[45:42] this who said that all kind of stuff
[45:45] like that but when it comes down to our
[45:47] soul none of that is important amen
[45:50] we must focus our attention on amen amen
[45:53] well I gotta be concerned about the
[45:56] destiny of my soul where am I headed all
[46:01] of this is just bumps in the road and
[46:04] I'm not gonna let these bumps stop me
[46:06] amen amen
[46:09] stuff amen the devil try to put it in my
[46:12] way to keep me from my destiny because
[46:16] I'm headed somewhere amen all of this is
[46:20] just a light affliction is it is that
[46:23] possible amen we got to go do some
[46:26] things
[46:28] because we go to things we got to be
[46:30] careful how we conduct ourselves when we
[46:33] go into our tests are you but you wanna
[46:38] journey and you've been tested and
[46:40] you've been tried I mean your action
[46:42] sometimes you can justify your action
[46:45] but God will never justify you in it
[46:48] because you got to take it and you gotta
[46:51] say god I love you in spite of me I'm
[46:54] not gonna be faithful to Brian
[46:56] Tabernacle feat little brother Simmons
[46:58] I'm gonna be faithful to God are you
[47:01] with me so the God that you serving amen
[47:06] you don't owe me anything but you all
[47:08] God everything how much do I owe him I
[47:12] told him everything well we got me
[47:16] without God we're nothing Hebrews for as
[47:28] it is appointed to men once to die amen
[47:32] I said on Sunday we have an appointment
[47:35] each and every one of us have God Terry
[47:38] amen you have an appointment but we're
[47:40] not looking to die he meant with we've
[47:44] already died in Christ but in reality
[47:50] it's just like Jesus was trying to talk
[47:53] to disciples and said my friend your
[47:56] friend louder is asleep and I'm going to
[48:00] wake him in and they said Lord of his
[48:03] sleep he do it well and Jesus said I
[48:06] want you to know he's dead
[48:08] so if I talk to you is the point of the
[48:10] man wants to die and after the judgment
[48:12] you don't want me to use the word Amen
[48:15] it's appointed to die because you're
[48:17] looking forward to the rapture isn't
[48:18] that right but in reality a meant some
[48:21] that here today may not amen make the
[48:24] rapture you might die before the rapture
[48:26] are you with me I might die before the
[48:29] rapture we don't know Amen but we just
[48:33] believe in that God is going to come and
[48:35] take us in the rapture before death
[48:37] comes amen
[48:38] somebody please God so just
[48:41] look at a mint but we know death is real
[48:44] and death is a reality Amit is not
[48:46] something that we just imagine in our
[48:49] mind and it can it can just disappear it
[48:53] it won't come our way we know it's it's
[48:55] coming everybody wait we can feel it as

[53:41] amen
[53:41] these carnal things that God has given
[53:44] to you and you got to use some amen that
[53:48] is my given increasing that's what we
[53:53] complain about that but this it's almost
[53:56] like the man said I ain't got for one
[53:57] dollar I might as well bury it a lot of
[54:01] people don't value their soul they bury
[54:03] me they just throw it away in my soul
[54:07] and my soul don't mean that much to me

[54:13] that's what it is people can do all kind
[54:15] of stuff in the pleasure of this world
[54:19] men will be lovers of pleasures more
[54:21] than lovers of God that's what the last
[54:23] days condition is we'll go out we'll do
[54:26] everything when it comes down to God we

[56:07] we're almost to
[56:18] maybe I just stored Romans two here
[56:27] and I just started father it says but
[56:32] after that the Hartness and infinite
[56:37] heart trade you up unto thyself rap
[56:40] against the day of wrath and revelation
[56:47] of the righteous judgment of God who
[56:51] renders to every man according to his
[56:53] deeds to death patient continues in well
[57:02] doing seek that's what I was this is
[57:06] diversity really struck me today to them
[57:11] who by patient continuance see in well
[57:17] doing seek for glory see you got a seek
[57:23] seek and you shall find
[57:25] seek for glory and honor and what see
[57:31] you got a seek for in mortality people
[57:35] want to live forever seek for
[57:39] immortality and that's what it means
[57:42] your soul amen
[57:44] it's in mortality Amen that God is
[57:48] providing for you but you got to seek
[57:50] for immortality he said seek for glory
[57:55] and honor and immortality and then he
[57:59] says eternal one eternal life but what
[58:04] happens but there's no seeking
[58:14] you know I you know I you know and in
[58:18] this covert time and the people you know
[58:21] not got around to alter not seeking and
[58:24] crying out to God you know I just you
[58:27] know I missed all time this amen
[58:30] coming out and crying out and seeking
[58:32] God on the altar crying out to God I
[58:35] seek I miss the way that people come
[58:39] together in a Norton and atmosphere is
[58:41] electrified and the people of lifting
[58:44] their hand and praising the Lord
[58:45] hallelujah the smiles on their faces
[58:48] Amen you missed out amen
[58:51] but I'm saying let's not let the devil
[58:53] take that away from us
[58:55] let's do what we can do we men let's say
[58:58] god I appreciate I will seek immortality
[59:04] it really struck my soul it stirred me
[59:07] up amen
[59:09] but he said here in a first but unto
[59:11] them that are contentious that are
[59:19] contentious and do not what and do not
[59:23] obey the truth o you of me but obey what
[59:30] unrighteousness in the nation and round
[59:32] he says you know you know sometimes
[59:38] contentious let's not be contentious
[59:43] amen but no this is their destiny
[59:46] tribulation anguish upon every one every
[59:53] why you see what I'm saying every soul
[59:57] of man amen every soul of man
[1:00:01] that was that doeth evil amen
[1:00:06] every soul a man that doeth evil of the
[1:00:09] Jew first and also to the Gentiles but
[1:00:14] glory honor and peace to every man that
[1:00:18] working what
[1:00:24] no one treats us do good amen because
[1:00:28] you have what God I mean that is the
[1:00:30] attribute of God even noting that the
[1:00:33] devil does to make God react or respond
[1:00:37] I mean they can spit on him naked
[1:00:39] whooping and naked 12 Legion away he's
[1:00:47] not gonna call 12-lead an angel I don't
[1:00:49] need a war I could've called 12 are you
[1:00:53] but because of his love evening and if
[1:00:56] that same Jesus dwelling on see me that
[1:01:00] same God that same word that same kind
[1:01:03] of life how do we respond in the time of
[1:01:07] our adversities when we'll try it and we
[1:01:12] will attest it how do we respond that's
[1:01:15] determines the destiny of your soul what
[1:01:19] you had it well your soul going brother
[1:01:22] and sister you've got to be concerned
[1:01:24] enough about your soul and the destiny
[1:01:28] of your soul that your soul is important
[1:01:31] is very valuable in it because God came
[1:01:34] down a menace on the condition that we
[1:01:38] were in and he said in I got to bring
[1:01:41] man bike he makes the wave hell from I
[1:01:45] see some sons and daughters that
[1:01:48] attracted at death and I got to make
[1:01:53] away a bridge to make them make a way
[1:01:56] for them to get back to God and I
[1:01:58] believe that God even through Jesus
[1:02:02] Christ he meant bridge the gap they men
[1:02:05] that separated you and I from God and it
[1:02:09] took the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[1:02:11] blood of Jesus Christ atoned for each
[1:02:13] and every one of us I know I couldn't
[1:02:16] get to my subject because I got the
[1:02:18] preaching you know I see the state slow
[1:02:21] down and just teach you know but I get
[1:02:25] it got excited
[1:02:26] did I go too fast okay but
[1:02:33] I'm dealing with your soul in there
[1:02:37] points because you know sometimes you
[1:02:40] can look on folks face and says it ain't
[1:02:42] get there it's not even penetrating
[1:02:46] because they don't see the importance of
[1:02:49] their soul it's not it's not in not
[1:02:51] surging deep it's not going down into
[1:02:54] the anchor the soul the soul got to be
[1:02:57] anchored what
[1:02:58] well how did this God anchor the soul
[1:03:00] amen his word goes down to the depth of
[1:03:03] your heart and it enriches you amen it
[1:03:06] makes your life richer it meant it makes
[1:03:09] your heart pure it actually sanctify you
[1:03:14] wholly it cleanses you amen it purges
[1:03:18] you've all unbelief and all doubt it
[1:03:20] makes you love amen in a deeper way your
[1:03:24] enemies it goes down in this surges so
[1:03:27] this is what I don't have time to get
[1:03:30] into this but I maybe I just I better
[1:03:35] cut off get the it's gonna take me too
[1:03:38] long just some things I want to get in
[1:03:41] but I love you today and I want you to
[1:03:45] love God if you love God you love me
[1:03:49] amen if you don't love God then ain't
[1:03:53] got no problem I still love you amen and
[1:03:57] that's what it's gonna take
[1:03:59] amen people want you to love them and
[1:04:03] they want to be loved but you got to
[1:04:07] love me even when you think I'm wrong
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:16] because the devil would pay tricks with
[1:04:19] all of us and he'll play tricks with all
[1:04:21] of our minds are you with me and if we
[1:04:26] listen to him long enough to take the
[1:04:29] love of God away from us well we can't
[1:04:32] allow ourselves to be victims of the
[1:04:35] devil we're not ignorant of Satan
[1:04:37] advices
[1:04:38] so brother and sisters by all means
[1:04:41] by this meant you know that you're my
[1:04:44] disciples because you have love one for
[1:04:47] the other and then brother and sister we
[1:04:53] ought to be able to lay down our lives
[1:04:54] for one another
[1:04:56] oh you whoopee for God's God lay down
[1:05:00] his life for us Amen it's alright to lay
[1:05:03] down your life for your husband your
[1:05:05] wife for your children amen but for the
[1:05:10] least one brother and sister let us be
[1:05:15] ready at all times to give an answer
[1:05:17] concerning home that God has given us
[1:05:21] he's given you and I he turn our life
[1:05:24] God has given us a place that he
[1:05:28] prepared for us and that place he said
[1:05:32] that where I am there you may be also
[1:05:34] I hid my father's house and I'm gonna
[1:05:38] tell you something God has prepared a
