[1:17:42] give us abundance of revelation let me
[1:17:44] just go to romans uh nine and and
[1:17:48] at 11.
[1:17:50] i got to
[1:17:51] come to a conclusion here
[1:17:53] i'm getting late in the evening sun
[1:17:55] going down i don't preach as long as i
[1:17:57] used to die
[1:18:00] darryl used to be preaching an hour and
[1:18:01] a half
[1:18:02] i don't preach as long as
[1:18:05] sometimes it extended two hours
[1:18:08] praise god
[1:18:10] hallelujah but god is good isn't that
[1:18:13] right
[1:18:16] romans 9
[1:18:17] and 11 read
[1:18:20] for the children being not born not yet
[1:18:23] born
[1:18:23] even have done any good or evil i want
[1:18:26] you to know something
[1:18:28] sometimes i get burdened i get a little
[1:18:30] discouraged
[1:18:32] because people are not responding to the
[1:18:34] word they're not
[1:18:35] really you know doing what they're
[1:18:37] supposed to do and living like they
[1:18:39] ought to live
[1:18:40] and you get a little discouraged people
[1:18:42] look like they put everything before god
[1:18:46] they come to church when they want and
[1:18:47] they don't feel like coming in on me
[1:18:49] they do this do that go here go there
[1:18:51] all kind of stuff
[1:18:53] i it's not wrong with going
[1:18:57] but sometimes to me
[1:18:59] as a pastor it kind of burden you down
[1:19:03] because you're expecting sometimes
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:07] that sometimes it's a purpose
[1:19:10] some people have legitimate reason of
[1:19:12] need
[1:19:13] but sometimes we do stuff out of
[1:19:16] we we need to save a little money
[1:19:21] we just blowed it
[1:19:23] then you come a couple you few years
[1:19:26] down the road
[1:19:27] so if i only went a little bit more
[1:19:29] responsible
[1:19:31] i could have been able to get this or
[1:19:34] that
[1:19:35] i'll do this to do that
[1:19:37] but because i didn't see up the road
[1:19:40] i thought hey i'm gonna
[1:19:43] you know it's like the product concern
[1:19:45] he was he wasted his substance
[1:19:48] he got in a place where he needed
[1:19:51] what he wasted
[1:19:53] are you with me
[1:19:54] and i want your spiritual walk
[1:19:58] i want your spiritual walk don't waste
[1:20:01] this valuable time that god has given
[1:20:03] you to worship and serve him
[1:20:07] don't
[1:20:09] don't spend it
[1:20:11] foolishly
[1:20:13] this this is a valuable time
[1:20:16] that god has given you it's not we're
[1:20:18] not talking about
[1:20:20] wasteful in the sense of
[1:20:22] the carnal stuff but your spiritual ways
[1:20:26] we waste a lot of god's time precious
[1:20:29] time that we can give to him
[1:20:33] i don't know about you but i i feel the
[1:20:35] need
[1:20:38] i'm close to 70 years old and i feel a
[1:20:40] need
[1:20:41] because
[1:20:43] i was saying if the lord didn't come at
[1:20:45] 80. i need to shut down
[1:20:48] sit down and rest a little while
[1:20:51] are you with me
[1:20:56] are you with me
[1:20:57] but
[1:20:59] i said well
[1:21:01] you know if i feel like i feel 9 at 80
[1:21:04] then i guess i got to keep on going
[1:21:07] are you with me but i don't believe the
[1:21:09] world got that long to be around here
[1:21:12] but the little time that i got here
[1:21:16] praise god i want to give it all i got
[1:21:20] i don't know about you but i i don't
[1:21:22] want to waste
[1:21:23] my
[1:21:24] life

[1:21:33] nothing
[1:21:36] just wasteful i mean just throw it away
[1:21:39] with righteous living
[1:21:42] the stuff that don't mean nothing and

[1:21:46] was valuable

[1:21:53] and make let it be valuable let your let
[1:21:56] your living and your time here let take
[1:21:59] advantage of your time here and let it
[1:22:03] be uh kind of worthy
[1:22:06] are you with me
[1:22:08] let it be worth
[1:22:12] are you with me
[1:22:13] see because a lot of times our lives are
[1:22:16] spent
[1:22:17] and we just spend a whole lot of time
[1:22:20] and you say well
[1:22:23] i'll tell you the truth
[1:22:24] y'all have a winner and bought you a
[1:22:26] nice
[1:22:27] big expensive meal and maybe spent
[1:22:30] fifty hundred dollars on it
[1:22:34] and couldn't eat meaty
[1:22:36] you ate but
[1:22:37] five dollars worth
[1:22:39] you know spent a hundred dollars for
[1:22:41] five dollar worth of food
[1:22:43] he said man i could have saved that
[1:22:45] money
[1:22:46] i could have bought a grocery
[1:22:50] you know what i'm saying
[1:22:51] it's oftentimes
[1:22:53] we we we do things
[1:22:55] and it it it ain't worth it
[1:22:59] amen but if we're only being a little
[1:23:01] watchful to look careful and a little
[1:23:03] prayerful we would have done something
[1:23:06] different
[1:23:07] oh you know what man
[1:23:09] the things that are of value to god
[1:23:13] and the things that are valuable in life
[1:23:16] amen sometimes we amen we undervalue
[1:23:22] we undervalue the things that are most
[1:23:25] valuable
[1:23:27] and we value that which
[1:23:29] is not
[1:23:31] profitable it's not even worth it
[1:23:35] amen the what we spent on it
[1:23:38] amen you ever spent
[1:23:41] a hundred dollars a couple hundred
[1:23:43] dollars for a past shoes
[1:23:45] in the hill about the way out
[1:23:48] within about six months
[1:23:50] maybe the he'll fall off it
[1:23:53] maybe holes start getting in the tennis
[1:23:55] shoes
[1:23:56] man i bought these tennis shoes they say
[1:23:59] jordans
[1:24:01] i get to jump in after i thought i'd
[1:24:03] jump out the gym
[1:24:05] you jump up and the rubber start falling
[1:24:07] off
[1:24:08] you see what i'm saying man
[1:24:10] somebody told me there was you know you
[1:24:12] listen to another voice
[1:24:15] you bought something that was
[1:24:17] less valuable
[1:24:19] and sometimes in our christian walk we
[1:24:22] make christian decisions
[1:24:25] based off fulfilling
[1:24:28] we make christian decision made
[1:24:32] based off of other folk testimony
[1:24:35] and how god blessed them with so and so
[1:24:38] on because they did that
[1:24:41] but what is for them may not be for you
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:46] so you got to make your own
[1:24:49] amen let god deal with you and lead you
[1:24:52] and god you
[1:24:54] and it struck you are you with me
[1:24:57] this is an individual journey
[1:24:59] praise god it might have worked for that
[1:25:01] one and worked for but it might not work
[1:25:04] for you because you are not them
[1:25:07] god deals with us as individuals
[1:25:10] are you a man so you're individuals
[1:25:14] okay i got to close but don't read the
[1:25:16] romans
[1:25:17] because
[1:25:20] god is good i'd have slowed down so much
[1:25:22] but i hope i'm saying something to
[1:25:24] somebody
[1:25:26] i hope somebody can hear what i'm
[1:25:27] talking about
[1:25:28] because i thank god
[1:25:30] you know
[1:25:31] my heart always goes out for the young
[1:25:33] people
[1:25:34] and i always want these young people to
[1:25:36] make it because it's too many young
[1:25:38] people going to prison there's too many
[1:25:41] young people like the young lady they
[1:25:42] said she walked off to
[1:25:44] miss america or whatever walked off the
[1:25:46] building in new york
[1:25:48] and
[1:25:49] you know
[1:25:50] 30 years old beautiful young lady lawyer
[1:25:54] everything going you know what i'm
[1:25:56] saying
[1:25:57] but
[1:25:58] you know look
[1:26:00] i mean
[1:26:01] and sometimes that's what fort won what
[1:26:03] she had a lot of folk spend their life
[1:26:06] for that
[1:26:08] but see that didn't vary i mean that one
[1:26:11] it wasn't that wasn't even worth it to
[1:26:13] her
[1:26:14] all that she had accomplished all she
[1:26:16] had achieved it wasn't even worth it
[1:26:18] because she was unhappy somewhere
[1:26:22] you with me
[1:26:23] so what i'm saying to you you can strive
[1:26:25] for all these things
[1:26:28] and they might not be viable
[1:26:31] and now we all are feeling
[1:26:34] oh god such a beautiful young lady oh
[1:26:38] lord i know how a family feels you know
[1:26:42] you pray for them you know so by the
[1:26:45] grace of god i want to say to you let's
[1:26:47] go
[1:26:48] finish reading roman
[1:26:51] you don't got to move
[1:26:53] okay
[1:26:55] valuable things
[1:26:57] the things we value
[1:27:00] are you with me
[1:27:02] finish reading romans
[1:27:06] that the purpose of god according to
[1:27:08] election
[1:27:09] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:27:12] calleth
[1:27:13] it was said unto her the elder shall
[1:27:15] serve the younger
[1:27:17] that is as it is written jacob has our
[1:27:19] love but esau have i hated
[1:27:22] jacob have i loved
[1:27:24] and he saw have i hated
[1:27:26] are you with me
[1:27:27] go ahead now
[1:27:29] what shall we say then is there
[1:27:32] uprighteousness with unrighteousness
[1:27:34] unrighteousness with god god forbid for
[1:27:37] he saith to moses i will
[1:27:39] have mercy on whom i will have mercy and
[1:27:42] i will have compassion on whom i will
[1:27:44] have compassion so then it is not of him
[1:27:47] that will is nor of him that run it but
[1:27:50] of god that showeth mercy
[1:27:52] i will tell you something
[1:27:55] god has had mercy on us
[1:27:59] god has had mercy on each and every one
[1:28:00] of us
[1:28:03] and because of his mercy we ought to be
[1:28:05] grateful
[1:28:06] and thankful to him
[1:28:11] and if we are not thankful brother and
[1:28:13] sister you miss your opportunity
[1:28:17] you miss the one that means so much
[1:28:21] you if you don't take an op advantage
[1:28:24] of your opportunity
[1:28:27] if you don't value the blood of jesus
[1:28:31] if you don't buy your his dying for your
[1:28:33] sins
[1:28:35] if you don't make a solid decision
[1:28:39] the lord
[1:28:42] you died for me
[1:28:45] you you shed your blood for me you came
[1:28:48] down to
[1:28:49] oh
[1:28:50] god did it for you
[1:28:52] but it's it's all kind of voices out
[1:28:54] there and things out there that distract
[1:28:57] you
[1:28:58] and make you not want to take advantage
[1:29:00] of the opportunity to give jesus your
[1:29:02] life
[1:29:04] so brother and sister i'm saying you
[1:29:05] need to take an opportunity you need to
[1:29:08] take advantage of this opportunity that
[1:29:10] i can get something that's really
[1:29:12] valuable more valuable than gold more
[1:29:14] valuable than anything this world has to
[1:29:17] offer and that is the blood of jesus he
[1:29:19] wants to give me eternal life
[1:29:21] and i want to take advantage of it
[1:29:24] praise god because if you don't
[1:29:27] then you don't know what you're missing

[1:30:02] but once in a lifetime
[1:30:09] the day might be the
[1:30:12] the time that god calls you
[1:30:15] the day might be the day that god says
[1:30:17] to you
[1:30:21] that i will bless you
