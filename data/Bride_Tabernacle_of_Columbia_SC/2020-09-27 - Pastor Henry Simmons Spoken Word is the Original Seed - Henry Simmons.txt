this time that we uh uh examine ourselves and see how much amid more we can give god amen give him all your mind all your time give him all you got god bless you hebrews 11 and one amen familia thought this morning i just want to encourage your heart i want you to think about it this morning and spoken word is original seed but i want you to think about your word body your word body god got a word body for you it was prepared before the foundation of the world amen because you were there before the foundation of the world before the what the world god had you in his mind here hebrews 11 says and now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders attain a good report through faith we understand it's the only way we can understand god through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made by the things which do appear may god bless you reader's word you may be seated the spoken word is the original seed genesis 1 1. see how we got here amen it was what was in god's mind god wanted to express his thoughts amen and god expressed what he was thinking by his speaking the word and when god spoke the word the word began to materialize when god said let it be than it was amen in the beginning what god created the heavenly earth amen you and i are a product your your word body you are a part of the new creation we understand that the devil has perverted and he has tried to make a better eaten than god made a better world than god made but his world his eating is satan eating and what he is uh deformed it caused death so the he has perverted god's word a perversion of god's word god said you cannot add or take away from it because it's the original seed that's where the life is and now taken away from it brings death are you with me so many have added to the word or have taken away from the word it caused death many tried to interpret the message of the hour many try to interpret the word but god is his own interpreter god interprets his word by fulfilling it the intellectual mind want to amen come up with uh uh uh his own intelligence that he knows all things but god says uh when he gives you the holy ghost the holy ghost knows all things he shall teach you all things and god has given us a urine god has given us an absolute and that brings us back to the word god will not disagree with his word so folks come up with new revelations and new interpretations but god fulfills his own word when god said amen that a virgin shall concede amen god interpret his word by fulfilling his word so you will amen as you anticipate your word body we want to look at what shall be and what was but we got to recognize what is amen and if you recognize what is then it does not yet appear what shall be but you got to recognize what he is now he said but you are now the sons of god are you with me and it does not yet appeal what we shall be but you got to recognize what you are now you are now the sons of god and it does not yet appeal amen but we know that when he shall appear that we shall be like him are you with me so i i trust that the revelation of god amen that he will show you by revelation who you are that you can be like him are you up man by faith we understand the bible said the light shining in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not he said except a man be born again he cannot see he cannot understand the kingdom of god we have come into understanding the kingdom because of the born-again experience the word cannot deny the word because he cannot deny himself are you with me brother and sister you and i we're not just folks that come to church we're not simply just christians that the world called it what we are the word manifested for the hour we live in are you with me so we amen have god's spirit to vindicate who we are accept the water of the spirit that bring the seed to life so the spirit amen is the water that brings the seed to life and vindicate that that's who we are are you with me so we need a vindication they meant god amen will speak for himself he said in the beginning god created the heavenly earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water amen and god said let there be let there be what let there be light amen i don't care how dark your life is jesus said i am the light of the world and we need light to bring forth the life are you with me in him was life and the life was the light of man are you with me so you see how the light and the light amen intertwined jesus said i am the light of the world i'm the one that makes vision possible amen praise god i am the light that makes your vision possible without jesus amen there's no light amen without jesus we'll walk into wholeness amen but jesus is the word amen the word is life and word amen gives a light it gives understanding to the believer brother and sister we understand god because the light has shined in our hearts amen and gives us the knowledge of god but he said if our gospel will be healed it's here to them that are lost at whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of them that believe not least the light of the glory of god which is the image of god should shine into them i'm glad it's shine he's still shining right now i got something to shout about i got something to be excited about i'm happy amen why because jesus amen says you and i your word body amen we're waiting in expectation and creation is growing and because this past house amen praise god one day it's going to be dissolved amen this past house amen this body that was amen it's a corruptible amen one day amen god has prepared for you and i am before the foundation of the world god had in his mind amen i go to prepare a place for you amen praise god what was in god's mind amen praise god amen god had you in his mind before the foundation of the world well you would me and god one day amen he had he came in the likeness of sin for flesh and far amen to condemn sin in the flesh they meant that the righteousness of god might be revealed in us god wants to show us amen praise god he came to likeness in the sin for flesh that you might come to become the likeness of god he became what sin was that you might become the righteousness of god in him amen your word body amen is being materialized right now glory to god because god inside of you has impregnated you with his word image amen and something has been formed into christ be formed in you amen until you're coming to the amen the fullness of the statue of christ amen god wants you to come into that person man amen i i want to bring you into amen your word body yeah god why you compressed out of this into who you are amen how god saw you in the beginning amen hallelujah jesus came from amen the logos to the word to flesh amen praise god now amen we're going back amen to what god thought about us amen how god saw us amen i see you amen and i know you because i foreknew you before the foundation of the world i saw you god knows your name amen he said let everyone the name the name of christ let him depart from iniquity amen nevertheless the foundation of god standing the sure having the seal the lord knows them that are his amen you can't get around it and i want to tell you as god know you my sheep they know my voice amen you cannot deny when you hear him speak something about the way he speaks it's got drawing power for you said if i be lifted up amen i will draw all men unto me amen moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness they met even so must the son of man be lifted up amen praise god what is going on it's the water amen of the spirit wanting the seed word to bring it to life are you with me god amen quickening in power amen to give you more than just church but giving you his life amen you are receiving seed word to bring revelation to your soul to quicken you out of darkness into the marvelous life to bring you into his image into his likeness to make you warn in god god hallelujah what is he doing [Music] god separate the light from the darkness amen this flesh they meant this past house amen it's in darkness but god can separate the light from the darkness meant the flesh from the spirit amen god is the discern of thought in the tense of the heart he can look down and he can see where the soul in the spirit and he can separate amen praise god knowing that all souls are mine but he said the soul that sent it it shall die so the word of god is quick powerful childhood and then they tore the sword amen god know your intent and god knows your desire god know your thoughts amen and your thoughts will speak louder than your words are you with me so god knows what you're thinking so god amen thoughts are perfect and he said i know my thoughts concerning you god knew what he was thinking and he saw you in perfection amen he saw you in amen the way god looked at you is the way you should have been but because of sin amen praise god you came amen deformed but god to his word is transforming you amen he's changing me he's saving me from glory to glory he's changing me let me back to where amen back to where i fell from amen i through eve we fail through sin amen praise god we came flesh but god is calling us back to word image the word likeness back to god back to your dominion back to your rulership back to where you can speak and it'll be back to god hallelujah back to where adam was back to god creating man in his own image back to amen the image of god hallelujah having dominion again see once you recognize who you are you walk with dominion you

intelligence his mind that you can know what he wants done with the word amen god wants to give you amen praise god not your own human thinking not your own uh ability where god wants you praise god hallelujah by his anointing i'm gonna tell you we don't know what's going on around us amen we think that we have just a a regular normal church but when god is doing something in the supernatural realm when god is reaching out amen in another dimension amen a lot of folks ain't meant to stay in the carnal world and in the corner dimension and they cannot see amen but we understand that the world was framed by the word of god amen is not what you're seeing it's just not what you aim in hand with your ear is whether or not your heart can comprehend what god is speaking amen is whether or not you can clam out of one dimension into another they meant god can lift you up amen and take you beyond the curtains of time and let you see your tea off in there amen let you amen walk into amen your paradise amen god can let you walk in to the eating of god amen because you can sat there in heavenly places where the sublime is where all things are possible to them that believe what's going

cain if you do right if you do what i said if you do right you know what happens we won't do it if you do right i'ma tell you something brothers isn't it sad for cain to walk away with an opportunity before him but he walked away and he just didn't want to do whatever did i had an opportunity to go out and get him a lamb come back and kill it you got opportunity to die to yourself and give god your heart you got an opportunity to repent of your sin and be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you got a right to receive the baptism of the holy ghost you got an opportunity to do that but brother and sister how do we respond do we walk away with our hands down and go out and kill our brother the very word that comes to savior were you denied and go out and crucify the lord of glory the one that come to give you life in life more abundantly will you turn your back on the almighty god and go out and say i'm my own god i tell you so many people walk around

and there's no day there's no night what makes a man know what's right and what's wrong that's got to be an intelligent come from somewhere but other than that everything will be in total chaos but there must be something down inside a man calling them there's a right never wrong as much as they're detained as a knight brother and sister you know that there's something but brother and sister one day the god that made the world is going to come back and judge every man by the book the spoken word is the original see and god's spoken word has become the written word in the written word it's been spoken to you that you might have faith to believe what's written in the word and god is saying to you if you hear my voice you can't hear except god amen for knew you no man can come to me
