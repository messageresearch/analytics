[44:35] what and over
[44:39] what God bless you you may be seated God
[44:43] bless your
[44:44] word now we we were talking about in His
[44:48] image and in his
[44:50] likeness here God says he created man in
[44:53] his own
[44:54] image in our image after our likeness
[45:00] amen so a lot of times people look at
[45:03] that scripture and they see three
[45:04] Gods you see God the Father God the son
[45:07] and God the Holy Ghost but if you look
[45:10] at Adam all you saw is what one the
[45:14] Bible says here oh Israel the Lord our
[45:16] God is what it's one God it's not one
[45:21] over here and one over the left hand and
[45:23] the left and right hand and God said
[45:25] something on the throne and just one
[45:27] God but the mystery was Eve was the
[45:31] mystery of Adam being
[45:34] revealed are you with
[45:37] me the wife is the mystery of a
[45:41] husband are you with me so Eve was hid
[45:45] in Adam so you and I was hid in Christ
[45:50] now we want to go to First John 3 so by
[45:54] the grace of God image and liken
[45:56] remember that God created man in his own
[45:59] image and his own likeness
[46:00] [Music]
[46:02] amen and when God had created all things
[46:05] he saw it was good it was perfect isn't
[46:06] that
[46:08] right our perfection in was taken away
[46:13] when Adam and
[46:15] Eve fell in the garden isn't that right
[46:19] they fell because they doubt Eve doubted
[46:22] the word and listen to the devil tell
[46:24] her a lie
[46:26] amen and when she listened to the devil
[46:28] lie she did what God told her what not
[46:32] to do ain't that right and when we do
[46:34] what God tells us not to do amen but we
[46:38] by Nature were the children of the Wrath
[46:39] we were disobedient children we were
[46:41] born in sin shaping and iniquity oh we
[46:44] couldn't have him doing
[46:46] wrong are you with me but he Adam and
[46:50] Eve
[46:51] amen at that time they were perfect they
[46:54] didn't have no sin
[46:56] and no reason to
[46:58] sin amen God had given them
[47:01] everything ain't that
[47:04] right you know sometimes we feel like we
[47:06] got it all and we still you know want
[47:10] more but what more could God give them
[47:13] the devil told them it
[47:16] more it was more and sometimes I we
[47:20] venture out to want more more than what
[47:23] God gives
[47:24] us amen
[47:26] yeah but I want you to uh be confident
[47:30] and settle now because God has said to
[47:33] you and I that we're Sons and Daughters
[47:36] of God are you with me that means a
[47:40] whole
[47:41] lot if you were you know
[47:46] uh what's the Google m i mean the
[47:49] different ones that these billionaires
[47:52] trillionaires you one of their children
[47:55] it it would be
[47:56] oh then you look forward to you have an
[48:00] inheritance amen just being their child
[48:04] entitle you to certain
[48:07] benefits just being the Son and Daughter
[48:09] of God uh entitle you to certain
[48:13] benefits it's benefits in being the son
[48:18] of a
[48:20] billionaire are you with me and you you
[48:23] have benefits in being sons and is of
[48:27] God are you with
[48:29] me image and His Image and his likeness
[48:33] let's just look for a
[48:35] minute 1 John 3 And1 it
[48:39] says behold what manner of what don't
[48:44] you know that God loves
[48:47] you what manner of love amen God loves
[48:51] you what man of love the father
[48:56] what manner
[48:58] of love the father has restored upon
[49:02] us that we should be
[49:06] what that we should be called the sons
[49:08] of
[49:10] God now if you do not accept it by faith
[49:14] who you are then you don't you
[49:18] don't you don't have the
[49:22] benefits amen but if you believe in your
[49:25] heart that God by his grace have called
[49:29] you and made you amen that he is your
[49:32] father that you are Sons and Daughters
[49:34] of God if you believe
[49:37] that then the
[49:40] benefits of being the Son of
[49:43] God
[49:44] brother when Adam was in His image and
[49:47] his likeness he said I give you what I
[49:50] give you
[49:51] Dominion ain't that right over the fish
[49:54] of the sea the birds of the I mean to
[49:56] give you every creeping thing you have
[49:58] dominion over everything this is
[50:01] yours amen everything is
[50:05] yours amen praise
[50:08] God what he
[50:12] says you should be CAU therefore the
[50:15] world
[50:16] what he said therefore the world knows
[50:18] you not know knoweth us not the Bible
[50:23] say Jesus was in the world and the world
[50:25] was made V but the
[50:27] world the world didn't know him did he
[50:30] he said if you a Son of God a daughter
[50:32] of God the world does not know
[50:36] you the Bible said all that is in the
[50:38] world is the lust of the flesh the lust
[50:41] of the eye and the pride of life these
[50:44] things are not of the father but of the
[50:46] world
[50:49] Amen If any man love the world the love
[50:52] of God is not in
[50:54] him amen so I want you to know that what
[50:59] the world is is the lust of the Flesh
[51:02] and the eyes and the pride of
[51:05] life amen what you
[51:08] see praise God is the world those
[51:12] temporal things the things that are not
[51:14] seen are
[51:16] Eternal are you with me and we must know
[51:20] amen the Bible says now not tomorrow
