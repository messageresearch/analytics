In Jesus name we pray. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles this morning, we'll turn to 1 Thessalonians 4 and ch and verse 13. And when you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, and it reads, "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if you believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so much as even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him." For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. So we shall so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Amen. God bless the reading of this word. You may be seated. Amen. This morning I like to speak on a little topic that I entitled rapturing faith. Rapturing faith. And and it was something that I started to the Lord started to deal with me with and I and I thought about this scripture to be raptured means to be caught up. And I and I thought about it. I said, you know, we have to get to a time and a period in God that we have rapturing faith. That we have the faith that we can believe that God is going to change our body. That we have the faith that we can believe that God is going to do a transformation unlike any transformation we've ever seen, heard, or thought of. that we come to the point that we can live in this life one day and be in heaven the next. That we come to the point that we got a understanding that God is is greater than we can even think. &gt;&gt; That is we can even imagine or even fathom God wants to take us to such a level in faith that we can be translated out of here. &gt;&gt; So that we can be transitioned right on just like Enoch and walk straight into heaven. See, that's how close we have to get to God at this time. And I was thinking about we look at the conditions of the world right now. We were talking about it in Sunday school this morning. How as you look at the different things that's taking a place in the in the political realm and the in the country and the as the Bible says the wars and the rumors of wars and and we seeing that these countries, they're doing many different things and this one's overtaking this one and this one's shooting missiles at this one. and these things are happening and it's just lining up with the scripture to fulfill what time we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it's lining up with the scripture, then we have to get in line with God wants us to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't be here and just coming to church and going through the motions or read our Bible here and there. We got to get in God and really get down the depths with God so that we can get that rapturing faith. So that we can get down and say, "Lord, I want to have the faith that I can believe that you can translate me right on out of here. that you can move me from this dimension into that dimension and I won't have to worry about this world no more. &gt;&gt; I started thinking about it and I said, you know, even examining myself and say, I got a ways to go, Lord. Lord, I if if you was to come, would I be ready? Pastor asked that in the in Tuesday night Bible study the other week. Are you ready to meet the Lord? And you got to think about it because that's a realization that you got to have with yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a conversation that you got to have with yourself. Lord, if you come for me, am I ready? Lord, if you come right now, am I striving to do what you want me to do? Lord, am I focused totally on you so that when you come for me, you can say, "Lord, I was about my father's business. I was about doing what you asked me to do and what you led me to do. Lord, I was about working on my faith so that you can take me out of here. That's what I got to be working on. Cuz all of this ain't going to matter. the job, the money, the fame, everything. It's not going to matter if you don't make it in. Said he got promises of great things that's over there for us. I was reading the scripture and I started thinking about it in John chapter 14 where he said, "He got a mansion for me. I'm looking for this house and that house and God got a mansion for me greater than I could even imagine or think about how beautiful that city is." And I'm thinking and I started saying, "You know what? I don't. The prophet of God said you don't want to be left behind. &gt;&gt; That's one thing that you don't want to do. You don't want to be left behind. And if you aren't making preparations, I'm sorry to tell you, you going to get left behind. &gt;&gt; If you're not doing what God told you to do, you going to get left behind. &gt;&gt; If you're not giving your life to the Lord when you know to do better, you hear the word and you know to do better. You will get left behind. &gt;&gt; We can't put you in there. We can't talk you in there. We can't convince you that you're going when you're not. It's better for us to tell you the truth. If you don't get right with God, you're not going where he is. Cuz no sin can get in there. No, no one that's lying a cheater, adulterer, you can't get in there. &gt;&gt; You got to have a cleansing out of your life over here to try to go over there. &gt;&gt; So, if you got stuff that you need to get right with God, now is the time to get right with God. You need to work on it. Said, "Lord, help my unbelief. Lord, help me to increase my faith." I was thinking about the scripture and I thought about it. I said, you know, faith workketh is patience. &gt;&gt; And I thought about it. I said, "Well, if you're working on your patience, just ask God to increase your faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when you say, "God, Lord, increase my faith." It'll work on your patience. &gt;&gt; It allowed you to become more patience because you'll realize, "I got to wait on you, God. Lord, I got to wait on you. Lord, I'm still waiting on you." And sometime you pray the prayer and have to see years before God manifest the prayer that you done prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, the time is getting shorter that we might not have years before it comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to say, Lord, hey, listen, Lord, I know you got a time and I know you got a thing and I know you ain't never lost one, but Lord, it would be nice to see it come forth in this time period. It would be nice. And so, he said, "Lord, I'm coming to you with a direct prayer." I was listening to the to the radio one time and I was listening I might have told it and this guy they was asking they they was having a prayer line on the radio and this and he was asking he said when he was asking people to call in and they said okay what do you want from God and we going to pray and ask the Lord to to do it and when he said when and when he did it I was listening this person and this person called in and you know I'm thinking about Lord well what I want you to do and so Because you know it's those moments like that. You never know what prayer get answered. &gt;&gt; And I said, listen, hey, it's just increasing my faith that somebody is in agreement with me in this moment. Whether it's the person on the street or the man that's sitting in the pool pit or anywhere else, if they got faith to believe that it can be possible and all I have to do is believe with them. Hey, listen y'all. There's some people outside that got more than you cuz they got the faith to believe that it's possible for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about it and this person that she got on there, many people was, "Lord, I want to bless with the house." She said, this person got on, "I want a three bedroomedroom, three bathroom." She knew exactly what she wanted God to do. &gt;&gt; And I said, you know, sometimes I got to get more specific with what I'm praying for. I got to get more specific and believing that God is going to give me exactly what I asked him for if that's what I have a need of. And she had a need of it. She said, "I got family. I got children. this is why I need this. And when she went, she had a specific prayer and I it came to me right then. I said, you know, sometimes we go to God as he says in the scripture, we ask a miss. &gt;&gt; We ask for the wrong thing so God don't give it to us. &gt;&gt; So, so when you go to God, you got to say, "Lord, I have a need. This is what I need. Lord, I need you to increase my faith. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need you to build my faith. Lord, Lord, however you decide to build it, Lord, I need you to increase it so I can get to the point to get up out of here &gt;&gt; to believe that I can translate from this to this level to the next level, then go all the way up till I reach your throne. &gt;&gt; See, that's where I'm trying to get cuz this life it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; You have to live this life. You have to work and do the things that God has for you to do. And you have to go about and say, "Lord, how do I go about your business for my life?" Each one of us got a different journey. All of our journeys is not going to be the same. Two people that come up in the same house going to have a different journey. But when God calls you, heed to the call. &gt;&gt; When God s comes to your door and knocks on your door, open up the door because you might not you might not get another opportunity to open up that door tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow isn't promised to you. Tomorrow is Many times we think, you know, I'm young. I'm strong. I'm going to be able to continue. I'll give it to the Lord maybe next week, next year, you know, but guess what? We might not see another year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If they start a war, hey, well, you listen, some of us under draft agent, you'll be right there. So, hey, that's all. It's an honest thing. &gt;&gt; If they go back to a draft, some of us in that rage range, they say, "Come on, we going to take you." Then you going to try to find God &gt;&gt; real quick. be like, "Lord, please don't send me." You going to get down on your knees quicker than you ever have in your life because you don't want to go see that. &gt;&gt; You don't want to go near that. You don't want to be in that place where they're going to have these things and you're going to be like, "Lord have mercy. What have we come to?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What have this world come to and you understand and you start to see the things that maybe our forefathers might have seen in years past. And just think about a nuclear war. If they ever decide that that's what they want to go to, it's going to get there one day. It's going to get there. Many times I pray, I said, "Lord, we know that the wrath is coming, but Lord, in wrath, remember mercy. &gt;&gt; Lord, in wrath, remember mercy." Because Lord, I don't want to see them bombs drop. I want to be gone. &gt;&gt; That that that that's where I want to be. That I've gotten it. And I was thinking I said, you know, I was I wrote it down. I said, "How many times have we gotten to the point that we're hindering our faith? &gt;&gt; We want rapturing faith, but we don't want to get our life right. &gt;&gt; We want we want God to do these things, but we don't want to do what he told us to do. &gt;&gt; We don't want to lay aside this weight and lay aside that weight and put this behind us and put that one behind us and walk by ourselves sometimes cuz that's what God requires of us." said, "How many of us want God to do these things, but we don't want to get rid of the stuff so God can do the thing?" So, we blocking God from even blessing us. &gt;&gt; We're blocking God from even moving in our lives because we got stuff that we don't want to let go. &gt;&gt; We got rooms that we don't want God to go in because we got some things that we want to keep in on. &gt;&gt; I said many of times we want to get and and then you think that you going to heaven with that. Come on. Listen. &gt;&gt; You can't take it to heaven. &gt;&gt; That's why he wants you to say, David said, "Lord, create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me." Cuz David realized, "Hey, Lord, I'm just a sinner saved by your grace." So, the only way that I make it is, Lord, you forgive me from what I've gone through and what I've done because there's no other way for me to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why God called him a man after his own heart. Cuz David was quick to repent and say, "Lord, that's me." Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't point to this one or that one and said, you know, you're the root of my problem and you're the root of my problem and Lord, you're the reason why I'm this way and mama the reason why I don't like going to church or this one or that one &gt;&gt; now. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's about your personal relationship with God for yourself. &gt;&gt; Whether you get it outside, get it in the church, you need to have your own personal relationship deep down in the closet on your knees. said, "Lord, hey, I got to get a real relationship with you because if you don't, I won't make it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Said, "Many of times, you going to hear the words like brother Ernest was saying the other night. It's going to be the words that you heard that's going to judge you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be the words that somebody tried to tell you to go the right way and you said, "You know what? I'm good. I got next week to do it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I got next month to do it. I got next year to do it. I'm good right now. this this is fine. Coming to church is just fine. You know, that's enough saving for me. &gt;&gt; Maybe once a week. Some people they satisfied with that. But when you get there, will God be satisfied with it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Will God be satisfied you could just come to church every Sunday? &gt;&gt; Was that enough God for you to get all the way to heaven? &gt;&gt; See, sometimes we think that, hey, I I read the daily scripture. That's enough for me. But you see, he said those that hunger and thirst after the righteousness, they shall be filled. See, you got to have something. When you really get hungry for something, you ain't aid in a day or two. For some of us, it take a couple of days, but for some of us, it take 15 minutes. And when you really get hungry, sometimes whatever was in the cabinet that you thought didn't look of appetizing, decided, hey, you know what? I can I can make do with this because it's the middle of the night. Ain't no stores open, but I'm hungry. So you trying to you you try to concoct something because you get hungry. And see, that's the way God wants you to come after him in this hour. Lord, I'm hungry and I want more. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm hungry and I want more. Lord, I'm not satisfied with where I was yesterday. I'm not satisfied with where I was last week. I'm not satisfied with where I was last year. Lord, I got to go to a higher place in you. Cuz Lord, I'm trying to make it in. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I'm trying to I want to see you build my faith and build my faith and build my faith till I get to the point that you can rapture me on out of here. &gt;&gt; See, I I'm trying to get to that point. And Lord, if I don't get down and get a life with you, GET A PRAYER life with you, I never get to that point. &gt;&gt; See, it's got to have a transition to somebody that get desperate with God and say, "Lord, I want to make it in. Lord, I want to make it in. Lord, I want to let all these things go and I want to make it in. &gt;&gt; I got to turn away from all the other things that's distracting me and put my sole focus on you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you got to get to that point that you're no longer I said I was going to minister on the mustard seed, but sometimes you got to become the full tree. &gt;&gt; You can't stay a mustard seed. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Many people, they got mustard seed faith, but they never grow from the mustard seed. They got they just like the man with the one talent. That's all they got. &gt;&gt; They never planted it in the ground to see if it would sprout. They never planted it in the ground to see if it would grow. And then when they Some people they plant it but they don't water it. &gt;&gt; Some people they plant it, they water it and then they get to a certain point and then they start clipping it. &gt;&gt; They clip the top out of it so it can only grow so far cuz that's all the height that they want that tree to grow. But when you really start to get it, you said, "Lord, I want it to grow to the full maturation of what it's supposed to be." &gt;&gt; And if it's the full maturation of what it's supposed to be, that faith is supposed to grow into rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; That's what that faith is supposed to turn into. Till you get to the point that God can come and say, "Boo, and you gone." &gt;&gt; Just like the moment in a twinkle of an eye, he going to call your name. You going to get up like Lazarus, just go &gt;&gt; and just transition right into the point that you here. You're here today and gone tomorrow. &gt;&gt; So, one might be lying in your bed and the other one to be taken. &gt;&gt; See, that's the that's the type where you get to that point that God has transitioned you to a level that you got the faith to believe that it's possible. &gt;&gt; That you got the faith to believe that God can do these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "So, Prophet God says, "So if our faith can come to that spot after him identifying among us and knows everything that's in our heart and has proved to be to us so that he's alive and confirmed it by the scripture," he said. See, now that shows that you don't have to just think you're trying to say something that some type of mythical thing. What this Bible has promised, that's the truth. Now, every word is true. Now, it's not it I may not have faith enough to make every word of it act, but I certainly wouldn't stand in the way of anybody that did have that faith. See, Enoch had faith enough one day to take an afternoon stroll with God and just kept on walking. Went up home without dying. Now, I think the church has got to come to that to a rapture in faith. I may not have that faith just now, but I sure sure wouldn't stand in the way of somebody that did have that faith. See, I don't want to be someone that talked about I might not have it. I got to have it. We're no longer living in the time period that we can can depend on I might not have it and still make it. You got to live that every day is the day that the Lord can come back. Tomorrow might be the day that the Lord is coming back. Look, if tomorrow is the day, am I ready to go? If if the next day is the day, am I ready to go? And I got to do what Paul said. I got to die daily because this flesh doesn't want to doesn't want to allow me to get to that point. But at some time I got to crucify the flesh. I got to lay it aside and say, "Lord, take every weight that so beset me." And I lay it aside at your feet and Lord, I'm not picking it up no more. &gt;&gt; See, when you get to that point, it it transitions because you realize what God can do. Because not only do you have the faith to rapture, you have the faith to believe in everything that you need. If the food start coming, you got the faith that God will put it in the refrigerator. If the gas cash gas run out of the tank, you got the faith that God, I'm nowhere near gas station, but you can put some in this tank. Well, so that I can make it to where I need to go. See, that's when you get the RAPTURE IN FAITH. ALL THINGS are possible. People can walk in and believe that they are healed and not have to be touched and and the healing can happen just then. Just like Peter and John when they walked through the shadow healed them. &gt;&gt; It's because they were living in a different type of realm in a different type of faith that [screaming] when they walked in all things were possible. And when you get to that point, then there be none sick among you. There be you'll start to transition to that level that understanding all the things that God is able and capable of doing. See, that's where I want to get to. Where I can move with power and authority and utilize the things that God said I was supposed to do. I'm living in that hour. I'm living in that season, Lord, that I'm supposed to expect greater things. And if it's greater thing, then I'm supposed to see it with my OWN EYES. AS we live in the day and age that the devil is increasing, the demons are increasing where the POWER OF GOD HAS TO INCREASE TO COMBAT the devil of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, that's where I'm trying to get to a rapture in faith that I can move in such a way that there's no more fear. There's only faith. [snorts] There's no more doubt. There's only faith. There's no more understanding. There's only faith. There's nothing but victory. in victory after victory because even when the devil comes, I know that I have victory. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; See, it's something to those people that get to a certain confidence level in the natural ability that they don't fear anything. &gt;&gt; You ever met someone that's that's not afraid of nothing? &gt;&gt; They will do some things to you be like, "That's absolutely crazy. That's absolutely, and I don't mean to use that word, but it's absolutely mindboggling that you believe that I can jump off this cliff and this little thing going to hold me up [laughter] and carry me all the way down and I'm going to land in a safe zone. But when people get a certain level of confidence and a certain level of belief, they got to have faith in that parachute that it's going to keep them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now, now if you really think about it, you just like a cloth wind drop. Yeah, you know, I might decide not to do that for my life, but they have a confidence that they're not afraid to do it. They not afraid. And some people, they get trained to a level, but sometimes you got to get your mind in that space to believe that these things are possible. &gt;&gt; And when you get there, you start to move with a different action. You start to move with a different confidence. You start to move. It's not because you're moving with things that you believe that you can do. It's that you have such a faith in God that these things are possible. These things are action. These things are going to happen. These things the blind will see. The he the person that needs to hear will be able to hear. The will walk. Cancer will be like nothing because I believe that God will remove it and do the surgeries that need to be done within me without the doctor doing the thing. See, when you get to that level, your faith has increased that God can do anything. God can do anything. Whatever I need, God can do it. GOD CAN do it. And I'm not going to stop until I see God do it. I'm not going to stop doubting till I see God do the thing that it becomes a testimony of what God can do because it's just going to build my faith until I get to the point that God can take me out of here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, it's rapturing faith that we're looking for. We're looking for a church without spot or wrinkle. See, when they get to that point, they're pure. &gt;&gt; When they get to that point, they have no spot or wrinkle. That's what God is coming back for. Said that you believe me so much that I had to bring you home. &gt;&gt; You believe that this thing was going to happen. I had to take you out of that world. You was no longer of this world. &gt;&gt; See, that's what I'm trying to get to. And God is trying to get us to till we get to that point that God said, "I got to come get you. &gt;&gt; I got to come take you out of here. This is not a place that light and darkness can be in the same place at the same time. So, I got to take the light out of this world." &gt;&gt; Say, "It's a it might be to some a horrible time to live in, but to some, you got to get to the point it's a glorious time to live in. It's a time that that God is going to do the things like we never seen before. God is going to make ways like we've never seen before. God is going to open doors like we've never seen before because he promised that greater things would happen in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said the prophet God said, "I want you to get built up now." And the holy oracles in the faith, the faith of this hour, the faith, it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age. Said it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age. But this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up. And so we want to believe in all that you have seen, heard, the word that that you have heard preached, the signs and wonders that you've seen. We want to accumulate all that together in heart and consider it whether it be of God or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like Elijah of old said, if God be God, then serve him. &gt;&gt; See, you got to get to the point that if you believe that God is God, If you believe that God is God and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek them, you got to believe I don't I don't I can step in into a realm of faith that I've never experienced before because I believe that God is God. &gt;&gt; And if he created the world, he can do whatever I I need him to do for me. Because he said, "Ask and it shall be given. If you seek, you shall find." See, that's all you got to do sometime is step into believing that what I asked for God provided. What I asked for and what I come to you in sincere heart to believe what is poss Lord all I got to do is believe it and you'll do it for me. Lord, if I need you to save and if I need you to heal, if I need you to go and resurrect and bring someone back, Lord, I send it forth and I expect a word to come back cuz you said it can't return void. He said, &gt;&gt; he said, "If God be God, then serve him." And G, and if Jesus is the center of all things to the Christian, then I think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him. &gt;&gt; Remember, he is the center. He is the north star. He's the ultimate. He's the absolute. And if he is the north star, there's only one thing that'll point to the north star, and that's your compass that you're sailing with. That compass that I'm trying trying you to sail with is the word and the word will always point to him. &gt;&gt; See, you got to get to the point that that you have such a relationship that Lord, whatever you promise me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Whatever you promise me, Lord, I'm claiming all my promises. I I I I'm not doubting no more, Lord. I'm claiming all my promises. all every last one of them that you promised me. Lord, I'm claiming all my promises. Lord, when I step forth and I go in this classroom, I know that you've given me what I'm supposed to have to make it through. Lord, when I go to work, and Lord, you know my needs at home. You know my bills. Lord, I'm expecting. Lord, when I go here, you increase the pay. Lord, you know the time that I'm living in. You know what I need. So, Lord, when I come to you, Lord, when I need this job, Lord, I know that you're going to supply it for me. Cuz when I go into this, Lord, you're going to make the way plain and the way straight &gt;&gt; and we feel like we're going through a great time of distress and trials. Perplexity of the time and distress between the nation and all kinds of things is happening and sometimes I get engulfed like everywhere I look is is in a ship out on the sea and how we're going to make it. Sometimes you might wonder, "How am I going to make it? &gt;&gt; How am I going to get through this? How is this world going to come through this?" But he but he but he said, "And here comes one with a white cap, like one of the waves 100 times bigger than my ship, but we'll crest it." It means that we'll make it over this wave. No matter how big it is, we're going to make it over every last one of them. Cuz we are more than victors through him. &gt;&gt; He said the captain, the chief captain, he's got a hold of the string on the end of the ship and he'll pull it through will crest every last one of them. You got to get to the point that Lord, whatever the waves may bring, whatever the wind may come, whatever the waves may throw against my ship, Lord, there's nothing too big, too hard that you can't allow me to come over, that you can't provide a way to come through. Cuz I believe that you are able. I believe that you're able to make a way, a position. Lord, you always made a way of escape. I'm just waiting on you to show me the way. Lord, I'm waiting for you to open the door that I can see the way of escape. That I can see the way that you made through the situation. Lord, I can see the way that you provided. Even though I don't understand it, I'm just waiting for the way to come forth. Say, Lord, I'm trying to get to the point, Lord, that I can believe you for everything. Everything. No matter what it is, give ability. No matter how much I need, Lord, I'm believing that you can do the impossible &gt;&gt; because the impossible has to become possible. The impossible is not impossible with God. So is it not impossible with God? And God said, "I won't be there. I'll be in you." So I got to believe that the God that's from heaven has come down to earth has got inside of me. And when I speak, he according to his word, it's him. It's going to come to pass &gt;&gt; because I got the faith NOW TO BACK UP the word. And if THE FAITH BACKS UP THE WORD, there's nothing that can stand in the way. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP GOD from moving on my behalf CUZ NOW I GOT THE FAITH TO ACTIVATE. I FOUND THE KEY. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO. LORD, ALL I GOT TO DO IS BELIEVE THAT ALL THING IS POSSIBLE AND EVERYTHING will come to pass. [cheering] &gt;&gt; See, that's what we want to get to this morning. Lord, whatever is in my way, Lord, I got to let it go so that I can get to the level I can move out of the way and say, Lord, touch my faith. Ignite my faith, Lord, that the fire may burn and burn everything out of the way so that your Holy Ghost can reign in this place. Lord, move in such a mighty and a special way that we can understand, Lord, what you're doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; Let us all stand this morning. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let us bow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to your name. &gt;&gt; Lord, we heard your word this morning. Lord, we know that there's a place that you're trying to get us to this morning. Lord, we know that there's something there's a work that you're trying to work in our lives, Lord Jesus. Lord, we ask that you, Lord, if there's anyone here that said, "Lord, I'm at this spot in my life, but Lord, I need you to increase your faith." If that's your testimony, I want you to raise your hand this morning. Lord, I want you to reccrease increase my faith. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. Lord, I lift my hands too, Lord. Lord, I don't want to be satisfied with where I am in you, Lord. I want you to lift me higher, Lord. Take me higher, Lord. lift me higher in you, Lord, to one day, Lord, I can just walk from this life into that, Lord Jesus. Lord, we asking that you'd move in a mighty and a special way, Lord Jesus. If there's someone here this morning that said, "Lord, there's things that's hindering my faith. Lord, there's something in the way of blocking me from getting what you have for me." And you say, "Lord, I I I want to I want to turn my life over to you this morning, Lord. I want to give you my all, say the Lord, I can reach the level of faith that was spoken about this morning. If that's your testimony, I want you to lift your hand this morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see all the hands that are lifted, all the hearts that are open, Lord, we ask that you just come into their lives, Lord Jesus. And Lord, through a transformation, let it be a testimony of the things that you can do, Lord Jesus. Lord, we ask if there's anyone here this morning that said, "Lord, I I've taken the first step, but I I want to take the next. Lord, I want to be baptized in your name." And that's your your testimony this morning. And I ask that you just lift your hands this morning. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We ask that you just touch that heart. Lord, we ask that you they come and they they come forward and Lord decide that that's what they want to do, Lord Jesus. Lord, we ask that you just continue to bless your people. Lord, move in a mighty and a special way and Lord, just touch the remaining of the service. In Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lord do [singing] Lord do it.

Give your life to the Lord, you can come. If you want prayer, you could come as they play. You can come. You want to give him your all and all and you want prayer, you could come. [music] Well, we want to thank the Lord this morning for the word this morning. Let's keep pressing. Thank God for our visitor. Amen. Thank God for all those visiting this morning in Jesus [music] Christ's name. Let's just keep pressing the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Let us just as we get ready to be dismissed. Amen. [music] God do it for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Rapture in faith. That's what we need, right? We want to walk out of here, but before we can walk, we can't take nothing with us. can't make take nothing in this world. [music] Said flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does corruption inherit incorruption. Amen. We got to lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us. We got to run with patient the race that is set before us. Amen. Whatever it takes, Lord, that's what I want. Whatever I have to give up, Lord, that's what I want. I don't want to be like this world. I don't want to live like this world. I don't want to act like this world. I DON'T WANT TO TALK LIKE THIS WORLD. LORD, I WANT to my conversation to be in heaven. I want to walk. I want to walk by faith, not by sight. I want to live.
