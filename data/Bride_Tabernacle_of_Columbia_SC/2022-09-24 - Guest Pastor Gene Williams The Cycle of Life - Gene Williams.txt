say about the book of Philippians Philippians the first chapter appreciate everything's been said or done the music the singing the praise the worship amen we never can get enough amen worshiping the Lord amen and the scriptures say everything that has his breath off the praise the Lord amen Philippians 1 I want to begin reading that the first verse Paul in Timothy the Servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus who I at Philippi with the Bishops and deacons Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God upon every remembrance of

way man uh we're on about oh my goodness what 40 years ago amen 40 years ago he married my wife and I amen 40 years ago so that's a long time amen and amen he baptized me before even before that amen amen and we've been knowing each other for many years amen amen and all of that but um or Damian to the ministry amen so we appreciate brother Simmons amen amen how many appreciate brother Simmons amen amen thank God for about a man of God Amen but most of all we're thankful for our Lord Jesus Christ who made it all possible that these things could happen amen so tonight just for a little while now uh Paul began to remind us here in Philippians for being confident of this very thing that he who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen now I like that amen because I know there are times when uh I may not be on my bed so look my best but God is still working on me and tonight I'm thankful that amen no matter how hard it gets amen he's still working on us tonight amen so tonight we just want to amen try to bring some words of encouragement to you because I believe as we reflect and look back in the hour that we're living in amen just lay down and I believe that it is the coming of the Lord is very soon amen I believe we can feel that there is a charge in the atmosphere that something is getting ready to happen we're going to look around the world and see why that's happening let me know that I can lift up my head to know that my Redemption is Joy now amen because my Lord is coming sooner to get me a manner now I can only speak for myself tonight amen you have to be able to speak for yourself amen because I know that he's coming soon for me amen but we find that one thing that we can definitely say that we may not be where we ought to be a man but I can always say that I thank God I'm not where I used to be now I know that's an old euphorism and oh I said but but it's a true thing amen because until the day God takes us out of here he's still working on us until the day that we are caught up in the Rapture there's still some more things uh that can happen in my life there's still a little step further that I can go Amanda you know I'm reminded that when Jesus was in the garden of God sending me up and every one of us would have a god sending me in our lives amen how you know he had to go a step furthery Manor a step furthery Manner and I believe that we got to go a step further amen amen so tonight now we just want to look at they'll say man about a man of being confident that he who began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ now we've got to make that person amen it's all right if I take my jacket off amen God is so good tonight not that anything it's not going to happen I just got harsh amen but but we but he who begun a good work in us will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen now one thing that I've got to learn is not to always uh uh you know you know we're so hard sometime on ourselves uh and on others a man of judging amen you know you know a judging amen I've been you know sometimes not knowing uh the soccer or where someone is at a manner and that brings me to my topic tonight Amanda the the cycle of life amen the cycle of life that we want to look at tonight uh and every one of us amen are going through the soccer of life we can look at it in the natural we can look at it in the spiritual but we all going through a cycle of life now in the naturally man we grow we we are born we come through our teenage years uh we come to our adult years uh then we get older and we start going back down the other way that's the sack of life and then one of these days amen is going amen but I'm saying God in the spiritual when I come to you I may not know all I need to do it I may not know all what that needs to happen but I know you're still working on me and there's a sack of that God has taken us through amen whether he's bringing me from justification or right on into sanctification or right into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not on that but the giver himself to come so he's still working on me but I'm confident of this one thing that he who begun a good work in me we'll continue it until the day of Jesus Christ no matter what is happening man uh God is still working on me so I say God thank you for not giving up on me huh help me not give up on you Lord because that's where sometimes it breaks down is when I begin to give up amen and I want to relate a story to you later on about amen about the sack of Life of how if one soccer is ever broken up we'll never see the end product Amanda but you know it used to be a little song we used to sing amen he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be or what I need to be and we say well it took him a week to make a star to move the Earth and all these things up amen but he's still working on me amen High loving and patient he must be uh because he's still working on me hey man uh when I get up in the morning and I'm not like I need to be uh he's still working on me that's the love and patience that God has for me so somebody may see me sometimes uh and I might not be where I need to be but don't judge me yet don't judge me yet because he's still working on me huh you know somebody said it ought to be a a sign we put on our heart amen you know don't judge me hey man amen because uh he's still working with me there's another party manner amen amen and by The Loving Hands of God Amen he'll fashioned me of how he wants me to be a man so he's still working on me how many thank God he's still working on you amen now I want this to be personal to us tonight that we are confident of this one thing amen that he who begun a good word in you amen now you have to put your name in that amen that God is still working on you amen and he said my brother Gina I don't need any more work Amanda well then uh uh hello Mr amen Enoch hey man hey man because it's time to walk on out of here Amanda but when that but until we get to that party man God is still working on me amen and I thank God for that tonight amen so we know that everything that God does Amen uh you know you know when we begin to think about all that we go through and I began to say it you know how sometimes we don't realize her but the strongest people amongst us are those that are that are crying Amen in in silent pain the strongest one amongsters are those who are are smiling are you man through silent pain they manner amen those who are cry behind closed doors they better amen those who are fight battles that nobody knows the body man why because uh amen something is still working on me man and sometimes we'll look at them and smite say oh Amanda that person uh you know needs more of God they better amen it may not be they need more of God it's just that God is working on something in our lives uh so I don't want to judge them yet I just want to wait amen and see the final part amen amen he is still working on me amen so I don't want to judge too quickly and what God is doing Amanda because he's not finished with me yet they're still uh unfinished part that God is still working on Amen he's still working on me amen do you believe that tonight amen now no one is not something we begin to think about this um you know you know it's strange how God how God does things he'll let us get down to the very last of the last the last End of the Road the last mile of the Road God let us get all the way down there Manner and why he's waiting they man uh he's building a man he's doing something for us say man uh amen he's building that Faith Amen in us to believe his word amen that what he said he will perform it amen God is working on his amen so we find out if we take for you know like the like the Hebrew boys amen a God who let them March right on in the fiery furnace amen amen right on in there amen and the stood right there amen but God was still working on me man in your life my life God will let us go right on through a problem amen and we say God why I'm going through this amen I'm working on something man I'm building something man I'm getting you to a place amen that when you come to this again amen now you know that I'm God Amen that I can see you through any manner so don't so be confident amen that he's still working on you amen don't be harsh on yourself don't be harsh on someone else amen because God is working on a manner God is bringing them through amen so I say thank God for what he's doing my life amen and all those they matter not only the Hebrew boys they matter but Daniel manner amen the little woman a little woman with the meal Barrow amen her son amen you know starving her and there she uh making a you know getting the last little sticks Amen to make a meal for her and a boy that they gonna die hey man but why but God was working on something amen God was building on something man up that when you hear my word if you take me at my word amen everything gonna be all right oh and when the word of God came to that that little will foreign did you not hear what I just said as I have no I don't have any more meal no more all in the cruiser but just enough to make for me and my boy that we're going to eat and we're gonna lay down and die and now you want me to go make you one God was working on her God was working on amen amen building that Faith Amanda amen take me at my word and see what a happy man and I challenge everyone tonight Amanda just to take God and His word amen and see what happens no matter what you're going through no matter what you're experiencing no matter what it's come upon you take God at his word amen and as he has taken you through these things now just be patient don't give up amen because God is bringing you to something amen God is bringing you to something amen do you love him tonight amen so he finds a little woman amen amen she took the word Elijah the prophet said and went to amen and made him a whole cake brought it back and he gave it to him amen and then she ended up go back and make you money man went back in there put a hand in the barrel and the meal never stop pull the crews of all that it never ran Holly Mana why what's happening manner she took God at his word amen amen and why she was working on her although it seemed like her face was gone amen seemed like that every Hope Was Gone amen but why God built us to a place amen that if I can just take him at his word I don't look at my circumstances I don't look at the problems I looked on the promise of God because I know amen that he's more than evil and that's what he built her up a manner and God wants to do that for every one of us build us to the place Amanda that that if he's with his word said it amen I want to be like this uh if God thought it and it was spoken I believe it and that sellers amen I want to be like little Mary uh God I don't understand it all amen but let it be according to Thy word amen and when you can come that way man things begin to happen so I say thank God for what he's doing in my life amen so no matter what you're going through God is still working on you I know sometimes we feel like just giving up throwing in this Towery manner you know when we read the scripture they man uh I believe in the second in second Corinthians amen you know four eight nine amen of how the scripture tell us amen that we're trouble on every side but not distress you know we are perplexed amen but not in disparate manner you know you know we're persecuted amen but but we're not uh you know we were persecuted but but we're not gonna give up amen because God is still working on me uh amen so when persecution come up I'm gonna rise amen because he's not gonna let me go down and not only that amen will cast down her but not destroyed why because God has worked something in my life to let me know if he said it I'm going to believe it and I'm going to hold because I'm confident it better so when I can go through life Amanda being confident of one thing or that no matter what I'm facing uh God is with me amen you know I said it like this say man uh you know when God said it was when the Bible tells us he said I will be with you or always uh amen I never leave you but we wish you always uh even to the end of the world I begin to say uh you know he promised to be with me uh amen and never leave me so no matter what I'm going through he's right there with me man no matter what I'm here he's right there with me man that's why the Hebrew boys are going to be in that five friends amen and why and why he was right there with him amen amen amen not even a stitch was on him not even a smell of smoke why because he was right there I said God build me up to that place so build me up to that place uh that no matter what is happening I'm going to trust your word I'm going to believe what you say man I'm confident I'm confident that you are working on me and you're not going to stop lorda though my steps make it slow Lord but you're still working up don't Lord I may I want to give up the time but you're still working order and all I want to do is hold on just hold on amen amen I want to be like Paula I want to just apprehend what has apprehended me if I can get a hold of him that way amen then I don't have to worry about it amen amen I'm confident in this one thing amen that he's more than anybody man isn't god well if they matter so the loving hand of God Amen what he's doing in our life amen you know and bringing that Faith Amen to believe his word now remember not faith we know what faith is Faith is revelation faith is also a is a conqueror amen Faith amen conquers amen Faith brings Victory and we find that conquer and victory are the same things and so when Faith come in your life why does faith stays out it matter why faith comes up why to beat down faith comes to lock up amen I'm talking about the things you're going through uh I'm talking about your problems amen so when you again when God built you up to that face amen build you up to where he wants you to be on and things come well you are able to pull them down every strongholder you're able to cast them a wife because God has brought you up to that place so I said Thank God Amen I'm confident that no matter what it is I have to face it man I'm facing it with you Lord you're right there with me amen amen I had a brother man hey man brother similar though I'm calling boo boo hey man amen Jim he's passed on her and uh well a little young gay man everywhere we're going you know in the neighborhood and people come around you know how we're being bars and everything you don't want to get in this little matches and everything but you know what I didn't worry about it as long as I knew that Booboo was back there I didn't worry I was like come on come on why because I knew boo-boo was back there oh my and that's the way we need to be a man uh when the devil and the things come up amen you know that God is with you you say come on I take the challenge because God has built me up amen he's right through me up to bring me to this place amen and I said Thank God Amen and I'm thankful amen that no matter what it is uh we're more than ever more than ever amen because God has built up to that place they matter so so that Victory now so what it does it matter it comes up to Concrete Man the faith Victory and the Conqueror to turn around to build up Hitman the tear down the chested in the prisoner to lock it up amen that you are greater they're the same that used to overcome you you're greater than the thing that used to bring you down you're now locking it up amen I say thank God for what he's doing in my life do you loving me back God is so wonderful man so the things that I I say Lord there's nothing about that can be hidden from your eyes amen so if we begin to look at what he's doing in this hallway man am I remember when I said don't judge too quickly man he's still working on you I said thank God for working outside now I told you it was a little story I want to they met to relate to you man amen to build your faith to build your faith amen because everything go through Cycles everything goes through Cycles amen you have the Sun goes through Cycles the moon goes through Cycles or nature everything we go through cycles and but we want to look at a manner of how a manner when you've got the winner you got the fall you got summer you got spring all of these things amen or Cycles amen and every one of them have their own distinctive amen distinguishing characteristic of itself so when you're going through some things there are certain ways a man that does you certain way that it will help you to appear and people are going to think oh my I knew they didn't have anything in the first place oh don't judge me yet there's an unfinished part he's not finished with me hey man he's not fishing man but I want to relay a story to you man if I can't a man amen and this is about a a man who had four sons and you may have heard it before I don't know but but a man had four sons and he wanted to teach them about you know about judging a man about judging him man uh you know you know I don't like when people just look at me uh you know sometimes you know how you're driving and I I want to relate a story to you first for this one I was going to a conference coming from Seneca to Columbia to a conference and I was riding with my SRO and at another SRO from another school and they were sitting up front with their police suits on living a police car and I'm sitting in the back we're coming down I-26 headed to Columbia and everybody will pull up you know you know we were riding in them because we want our jurisdiction so they were riding in the lane and sometimes people in the seat is not the district that I'm seeing us the area they're from they're just going to buy them so people's passing us you know and they get up beside us they'll look over in the car look back at me almost to say and what have you done I'm like I haven't done anything I'm just getting a ride to the conference amen but why but because I was sitting in the back of the police car they figured I had done something wrong figure that I was in trouble man but you know what I was just catching a ride and that's how sometimes people were judges amen sometimes you're you know you you just went through something hard hey man and you might not you might walk by somebody you might not speak to them now and say I know he didn't have the Holy Ghost so you know you know don't judge me yet don't judge me yes I'm still going through and God is building me he's bringing me to a place amen he's bringing so this so this this this father wanting to teach his sons amen how not to judge how not to judge her so he sent them out Amen to uh to observe a pear tree during the different seasons and he sent one out and he went and he observed it in the in the winter time and when he went to the winter time he saw that it was ugly and bent and twisted now I want you to think about your life sometime I was just ugly bent and twisted amen you know and then the next Sunday manner he observed the pear tree in in the springtime and he saw it and it was it was covered with green buds uh you know and uh and and just a full of Promise amen you know how somebody first come to the Lord amen like they're ready to run through wall and make green buzzing full of Promise amen you know but then one of them observed it amen in the summertime and we deserve it in the summertime he saw it was full of blossoms up and smell real good and was real Pleasant amen and we're just so good to observe amen you know and and then and disagree with the other ones amen of how a man that pear tree look and finally the last son he observed it in the fall time and he disagreed with all the other ones and he told him he say uh you know I see it Amanda Amanda just drooping with fruit amen and full of life amen oh my and that's about how our life he'll say man amen and just think about it now amen uh if uh if uh if the one in the wintertime would have given up amen he would have never experienced a man of his Springtime amen he would have never experienced a guard getting a hold of him and moving him on up amen why because all lord I can't do anything Lord everybody hates me and why they want to just give up hey man don't give up in your winter time move on to your Springtime amen where you got the buzz amen and the promise of life amen you know and then uh and then the winner and if he'd have given up in the springtime he would have never they've been enjoy amen amen the Fulfillment and the spring of the summertime amen amen the pleasant amen of the joy amen of everything that's blossoming amen and looking good amen if either giving up amen but all that that went on down Amen to the falling Manner and the fruit began to come out Amanda amen it kept on going Amanda he didn't give up amen even when their lives were Twisted amen even when things are Lord I'm so backwards Lord I don't know how to go out I don't know how to come in or but God I'm a hold on I'm gonna be like job I'ma wait till my change I'm a I move for my winner Amen to my spring to my summer and right on into my phone that I could see the fruit of life amen come in why because I'm confident that the one amen the one who's working on me he won't stop amen he won't give up amen he's going to continue until the day of Jesus Christ and the Christ shall be formed in me amen he's going to keep on going so I said Thank God Amen oh I just love the Lord don't you love him tonight amen I try not to be too much longer man but we find out so all of these things amen so we find so so they learn a good lesson about not judging a man because sometimes we might catch someone in their winter time sometimes we might kiss someone in their Springtime or in their summer wait until you see them in the fall and see what God has done for me wait until the finished product come in man so I said thank God for what he's doing it man so that's an encouragement that I want you to if I just keep continuing holding on Amen because we all go through things we all go through things amen and I know you go through because I'll go through but I say thank God you're still working on me still working on me don't give up amen so that's as Paul said now being confident of this very finger that he who has begun a good working me are will continue until the day of Jesus Christ amen how many believe he's working on you tonight amen so I want to persevere man through all of my difficulties everything that life throws at me man I want to persevere through those things that matter I just say Lord just just let me just just live according to your word just simply live according to your word Lord amen and this Lord just love you Lord and no matter what comes order I'm gonna just just let you take care of the rest of the Lord I'm gonna put it all in your hands up and let you take care of it and God would do it amen because he promised never to leave you nor forsake you but to be with you always to the end of the world God has a plan for everyone in our lives sometimes I may not understand why he's taking me this way while the tender hands of Jehovah is leading me this way but one day I Now understand amen amen uh what was meant for evil God has turned into good amen amen God leading you amen so I like what Jeremiah saying Jeremiah amen uh 29 and 11. man notice what he said for I know the thoughts that I have for you God's plan that he has for our lives and their thoughts are not of evil but of Peace amen to give you or bring you to your expected end not what the winner shows not what the spring shoes not what the summer shows are but to bring you to the fall where you come into your season you're coming to your season and begin to bring forth fruit amen so that's everything go through season everything go through season I'm skipping a lot because I want to Every Now whoever you pitching man so I I think when I'm thinking about Cycles amen I think about Moses them how God took Moses up through a socket I remember now Moses was born a proper child now Moses didn't know that but God knew that and then when his mother Jacob Bell began to teach him things uh you know and no and Moses was taking those things in her but still a matter Moses a matter amen didn't quite get to where he needs to be a manner amen there he was uh amen his first 40 years are and when God called him up he was refused of his brother he went on the back side of the desert began to hurt the Sheep 40 more years but God walked through with him yet amen God hadn't brought him to his expected end and there was Moses out there man and God cut his attention up by burning bush well he said Moses I'm not through with you hey man I'm not finished amen they may have given up on you but I haven't given up on you they may have put you aside but I hadn't put your side come on Moses I I got something for you to do amen and that's how our lives amen sometimes we think that's it lord I can't go amen nobody has anything to do with that but God is still working on you amen don't give up on yourself don't give up on God hold on hold on Amen so there were Moses amen here God had him been a long year amen being a property manner leading the children matter another 40 years and Moses I was going in the promise and why Moses 120 years God working on him inside us now if you look at Moses in the beginning you know you'd have never thought he was going to end up being a deliverer even though God already had it in his word but if you look at how he was living in Egypt being the next pharaoh sit there let them Fanning him with the big Palm leaves popping grapes in his mouth you never thought that Moses was going to be the deliverer Moses had it easy amen but that wasn't what God called him to be a man God was still working on him and the thing that he endure in his life was building him to that point amen the things he had to go through was bringing him to that party man so that's why I said God our glory in my trials I thank God why because they're building yeah they're bringing him to where I need to be a man I'm not trying to kill me that is bringing building character and bringing me where I need to be a man as God working on us amen that's what Paul said man you know Glory man the things that you go through glory in your trials and make got a greater weight coming up but we find so uh so this Moses amen God was just working on him bringing him to the place he needs to be you would have never thought that Moses would have been to deliver look at Paul you would have never thought Paul would have turned out be one of the great Apostles amen but been the one that bring light to the Gentiles they met up a man that was going up and chilling amen the people of God Amen putting them in prison Hitman standing there at the stoning of Stephen amen amen Paul's all all of that happen amen but why God wouldn't do with me man and that's why Paul could turn around and say I thank God who separate me from my mother's womb why because God had to do something for me Amen to begin to reveal something and bring him to the place that he needs to be amen I say thank God the things that may happen in life remember your beginning is not your ending your beginning is not your ending God is bringing you God is building you and God is taking care of you you love him tonight amen so we find ourselves Moses all the things that went through amen and those things were just to build him to where he needs to be man you never thought that those things that may would have brought Moses and meant to that place but God knew what he was doing so I said Thank You Lord thank you for what I'm coming through amen amen I want to read a scripture man the book of songs amen Psalms one amen one two three he said I blessed is the man that walketh not in the cancer of the ungodly nor standeth in the ways of Sinners nor sitteth in the seed of the scornful but he is the light is in the law of the Lord how many of the words of Lord amen amen and his Lord he meditate day and night amen and notice now and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bring it for his fruit in his season God knows when you're coming forward God knows where you need to be and he knows how to bring you that amen his Leaf shall never or not will them and whatsoever he do or shall prosper that's God building you amen that's God building you Amanda so I say thank God for what he's doing in our life amen you love him in a wonderful manner so he finds all of these things may happen in our lives and that happen for a reason amen because we are confident of this one thing that he who begun a good work in us will continue it until the day of Jesus Christ amen I love the Lord ain't God one thing man so God now so God Amen he is Faithfully man when God starts something he doesn't just stop any man he completes it amen he completes that man I want him to continue to work on me I just need to have faith to believe that whatever he's doing in my life I want him to keep on doing it man they bring it to a completion they matter amen scripture I want to read to you man before I try to stop it man no it's not God never leaves us alone he never forsakes us I like what Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus of Good Works which God has before ordained that we shall walk in them so God is not going to start me with something uh and stop it Amanda but he's already ordained for me to walk in amen his good work amen all right now Damien to come to my expect to end so he's going to keep it on her and all those things may happen in my life amen all the things are amen they may not be good but they'll build them into something they Manner and Paul tell us this in Romans 8 28 he's out and we know that all things are worked together for good amen oh my not that they all good but they're going to work to my good they're gonna bring me to the place I need to be up so all things work together for good amen for to them that love God how many love God tonight amen amen so whatever he's doing amen whatever you're going throughout is working out to your good amen you might say lord I can't bear that he knows how much you can bear and he'll never put more on you than you can bear he's going to bring you till you expect to end and he's going to make sure amen that the work that he's doing in you is gonna he's gonna continue until the day of Christ amen but all things work together man for for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son thank God thank God for what he's doing to us amen remember now you got you're gonna come to something in this hour man uh amen there there are some images that you're gonna come to Amanda and I thank God that he's conforming me to the image of his surname amen now another image out there is an image a manner of the Beast amen I don't want to come to that I want to come to the image of his son amen amen knows now that we come to the image of of his son that he might be the first born among many brothers moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified then be also glorified what shall we say to these things if God before me uh who can be against me amen I say Lord that's where I stand up because I'm confident that you're still working on me out so there's nothing uh there's no weapon that could be formed against me Lord if my God it can't stand why because you were walking on me you're bringing me to the place I need to be a manner I said Thank God Amen thank God Amen and God is workmanship we you and I and he's bringing us to this image bringing us to the place that what he had in his mind he can look out and see you standing in that fulfillment of his word and I said God I thank you I know it's hard I know the things we go through sometimes they want to we want to give up but don't give up he's not giving up on you he's not giving up on you amen he's going to continue until you come to a place you need to be God never gave up on Moses he ran to the back side of the desert but God didn't give up on him so no matter where you go what you do he who begun a good work going to continue but I'm not going to have anything got to do with it that's what you said but it's not what God Said Amen he will continue to work and bring you to the place that you need to be amen I say thank God I want him to continue to work on me man because when he's working on you and man he's doing something for you man he's bringing you to that place Amanda I said Thank God Amen and now we're living in with such going on such as the world and such chaos amen but God's working on me amen amen I don't look at amen how the world's falling apart it matter economy falling everything up amen well I look to the promise of his word amen that when all of these things begin to happen when all these schemes begin to take place hey man I know that I can look up I know that my Redemption draws now because he's working on me amen but no it's not so as we begin to think about a matter how you know the God is coming for his bride you and I man coming for us amen amen and we have all these challenges that we're up against Amanda but don't let the devil don't let the devil cause you to fold in be like sham guard know that God has given you a promise know that you're part of the Covenant and that nothing they may could stop you if you know amen what God is doing in your life amen so it came to a place Amanda that when sham guard or a man got tired of of the devil taking everything amen and and he can look back and say uh I'm a Hebrew I've been circumcised I'm part of the Covenant amen wow and why and all of these things have been happening to her was building Shem Gordy man to recognize who he was that you don't have you don't have to let the devil run over you and Sham guard got to the place amen not a trained Warrior but to look to God's promised word and when this Philistines came in and his wife and children were crying amen about everything gonna be taken away her sharing look back there and grabbed that Ox guard and come out amen and beginning according to the promising manner of God's word amen I will not amen give him God has built faith in me and now Faith amen I'm gonna beat everything down I'll take my faith amen and I'll paralyze the world why because God has built me up to that place that the world cannot paralyze my faith anymore hey man it cannot put me to the place that I won't trust God anymore that I won't believe God anymore the world can't do it right because God doesn't build I've seen him do too much I've seen them a manner performing word I've seen him come through I saw his faithfulness and I'm built up to know that my

built up to know that God could do it amen so they didn't worry about it amen so that's the place I want to be no matter what is happening I know my guard is more than able to take care of me they bring me to my speaking in any one of a man so all of these things you're being challenging now but remember God wouldn't put those things in your life if he didn't think you could handle him if anything he could bring you through amen Little David going against Goliath God would have never put him before Goliath if he didn't think he could handle amen and God would not put a Goliath in your life if he didn't think that there was not a little David in there that take care of the things that you're confronted with so I'll say thank God for what you're doing in this hour for me because I'm
