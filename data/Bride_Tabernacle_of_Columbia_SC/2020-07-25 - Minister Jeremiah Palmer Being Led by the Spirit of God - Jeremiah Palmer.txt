to keep him strengthen him lord direct him lord i actually god for your mercy and for your grace tonight lord take control of god of my mouth lord and bless the people in jesus name amen and amen you have your bibles i want to turn to two places the one first let's go to the book of romans the eighth chapter romans 8 12 through 14 and then we turn to the book of revelation 2. romans 8 and 12 to 14 therefore brethren we are adapters not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you leave live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god let's just pray father we thank you for your word tonight god may you blessed sanctified in jesus name amen you'll be seated and returned to the book of revelation revelation the second chapter i'm just going to read one verse for the sake of time tonight because i'm not mean to be long at all it says talking about the pergamos church age it said so has thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitan which thing i hate uh tonight i want to talk to you just for a few minutes tonight that i say not meant to be long at all but i want to use for a thought tonight being led by the spirit of god being led by the spirit of god i realizing more and more now that we need the leadership of the holy ghost i've been saying time past that without the leadership of the holy ghost then who's leading us there are only two of spirits and that's the spirit of god and the spirit of the devil and we all are being led by something something is directing us and something is is leading us but where is it leading you uh in time past i i realized that uh sometimes that we [Music] we be trying to lead god instead of god leading us and that's where we get into a lot of trouble at because of we are more smarter and you know can think better for ourselves as we think so uh but the bible says there's a way that seemeth right but that way is the way of death we make choices we make decisions a lot of time without consulting uh seeking god about it and then when we do we get out there and we all alone because we didn't wait or didn't consult god on it no matter what you were doing in this life and i know we all love we like to say we are grown folks and we can handle things with our own but you'll find out you can't i know myself all the things i tried to do it my way or because i feel that is this is right and then when it don't turn all right then i got a mess but why not seek god while he can be found why not the bible said wait on the lord and he shall direct your path see and it's something because we are as human we don't uh feel that we have time to wait we got to have it right now we we we just got to do it but you'll find out that if you wait for a while and wait till you get something from god on it you'll be better off and sometimes i know like opportunities come and you have to make uh you know decisions immediately and i understand now that it it's not good to rush and do anything especially when you're pressured you know to uh i need an answer now it's best to wait even if it means some time to to pass up an opportunity that that seems so great and and so good but it ain't real good of god ain't it it can cause us sometimes some uh uh real heartaches it can sometimes mess our life up you know and and cause us to really lose it because we didn't seek god and get god direction on it you know i just really was uh uh facing something and waiting and waiting you know and you know i'ma tell you something it's good to be patient and wait on god and i understand now you know that god is not in a hurry because god already know what you want to do we are ambitious people we have goals and things that we want to achieve and nothing's wrong with that but why not take it before god because i believe that we really want to do it the right way and i believe without consulting god on it you make a mistake and then after you meet you have to live with that rather it turn out which way you've got to deal with it you know i i said i look at my life sometimes and the things that i uh are dead you know without really praying about it without getting some kind of direction from god and it cost me you know but i realized i can't sit there and mope in it you know i i want to take those things and use them as stuff in the stones you know we ought to learn from the previous things that we've done in time past and and not really are seeking god and getting some spiritual advice from god on it sometimes it really you know it a battle with things in my mind because of choices and you know what i made and i realized now you know the older you get you learn and sometimes the lessons that you learn it costs you but you you have to keep moving and understanding that i need god direction see even now i mean this epidemic we're trying this and we're trying that and we're looking all over the the right way to do it you know and but we we're trying we're coming up with ideas we're coming up with proposal we we're coming up with all type of a relative thing that we are going to try to do and we are finding out all of it is failing and fail to realize that jesus is the only answer he has all the answers to everything that we have made of god has the answer and but because that uh uh people don't want to acknowledge acknowledge that we have a supreme being that knows just what to do but because of intellectual conception in in science and technology that's good in a way but when it comes to god there's no better answer i was looking at uh uh the church changes that we have been dealing that this summer school time passed and it brought me back to when i read uh here in revelation 2 15 uh about the pergamos age talking about how god hated that nicholaity now this was a spirit and if you remember the seven church ages and how now in the nicolaitan age you realize that this was a doctrine in pergamos but in ephesus it started out as a deed as a saying but in partners in the third church it became a literary teaching of the church see it started off subtle with just a little saying about it now but i looked at this and and looked at it and saw the spirit and what it was what it came to do and if you remember now the devil main purpose was to exalt his throne above the most high he wanted to be like the most high god in other words he knew that god was a spirit and they had to worship god in spirit so the devil sent his spirit into the earth and as the god had a gospel the devil had a gospel as god had the holy ghost the devil had a deceiving spirit see he couldn't create nothing but he are a cop it off what god had already made and so his spirit as satan was was so close like god you know that's why the angels that he deceived they believe a third now of heavenly angels believe satan gospel it was that was a spirit that was strong that it caused the angels of god to believe the devil lie and they all got kicked out of heaven and when they got into heaven they came to earth and then because satan got into the human race the way he did you know through the deception of the woman he was able to penetrate and that spirit as eve said the bible say that eve was seduced she was seduced by a spirit that noticed uh when he was talking to eve he didn't tell her what god was saying wasn't true but he just added and eve listened now she had a commandment that don't touch the tree of knowledge and good and evil but because satan made that tree so much like god like truth 99.9 true one percent lie and then that spirit that started it existing right now today now i want to read a little something here you know at the server to god was talking about it he said you will recall that i brought out that ephesian age the word nicolaitan comes from two greek words nico means to conquer leo which means a laity naked nicolaity means to conquer the lord conquered the people now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because god has never placed his church in the hands of an intellectual headship which moves with political mindedness god always from the old testament he wanted to lead the people of god by his spirit and as long as the people stayed with the moving of the spirit of god they were safe but when they left off and went on their own way and did their own thing chaos and the servant of god said also here he said now uh you remember in the in the efforts of age he said now that uh that the people were being subject somehow in a way that was absolutely contrary to the word of god they some other spirit was had came in and began uh take them away from the real leadership of the holy ghost and then man begin to uh rule over them see not by the holy spirit now but they used uh beca all type of things just to come in and take authority over the people but this was actually a spirit not about the man but it was a spirit that was operating and that spirit is still operating today i was just saying i said it's one of the most urgency things that i believe that the people of god must understand you've got to get the holy ghost without it you are open target so the holy ghost is such an urgent i believe it could never be really or emphasized how greatly that we as ministers must uh uh get the people back to the leadership of the holy ghost and that's why people are just running off and doing this or that because without the holy ghost what else can you do see but the devil has always been trying to get the spirit of god out of the church get it away from the people y'all don't need the holy ghost like that you got a message or you got a deal so you got a dad the very message we have it took us to the very life of god the holy ghost it really stressed that uh what god did was he brought us back to our first origin with the first church in the book of acts as god sent them and told them to go and tarry in jerusalem until you be endued with power see because through uh the gospels you know as yet the holy ghost had not been given but after jesus decision he sent them to the upper room and said wait there because you couldn't really you wouldn't really know what you're doing if i don't sense something if i don't send the comforter jesus said in one place he said it was expedient that i go away because if not then the comfort of the holy ghost won't come and he will lead you teach you and guide you into all truth see the holy ghost will that's one of the evidence the holy ghost will lead you to all truth not just part ways see that's the real holy ghost see you you may have some portion of it but that real hole that goes if you if your your spirit is sincere with god and your heart right the evidence of the holy ghost he'll take you to all truth that's why sometimes to talk to people and you know you holly can convince them that they don't have the holy ghost and i don't try to take that away from it but you know you try to let them know that there's more to what you have there's more to god than just the restoration of the gifts there is more to god you know than just the jumping in the shot that's all right but there is a a person that the spirit of god that wants to get in you he wants to direct you he wants to take you further into the things of god see not just with the gifts that's all right but let's let's get the giver of the gift let's get the person who who gave the gifts and when that life of god the real life of god get in you then he'll show you what you need to do oh but you know sometimes you know how we are when it comes to religion which is one of the the most uh dangerous aspect of anything you know because of our country and everybody seems to know god you know no you can hardly meet anybody that don't know god but when you try to carry them back to the word and and try to show them what the scripture the scriptures don't contradict you know one another you know god don't do it man does that well now in in this uh nicolaitan this spirit here what it was actually doing it began to move the people you remember in the ephesus they already left their first love which was the word and when you leave off the word then there's something else taking control over you see the holy ghost the spirit of god won't take you away from the word because they are one but it wants to take you further into the word see because the word is eternal and it keeps getting brighter god began to reveal himself you know to you more and more that's why i appreciate you know the message that god sent for us in this hour you know because it really opens up our spiritual understanding about the things of god and what god wants to do in our lives god wants a church that's led by his spirit you know a lot of times we always said we can have the spirit of god on us on our flesh and on our spirit that's okay but god wants you to get it down in your soul and so many times we settle for it just being on us but god wants to be down in you where he is leading you he is speaking to you as an individual and telling you what you need to do even through the preaching of the word you know as i i'm just recalling instead of feasting you know as brother ernest spoke the other night you know to be able to know when the spirit of god is speaking especially to you it'll do something to your inside you know it's not just a good sermon but i was thinking earlier about hebrews 4 12 says the word of god is quick it's powerful it's sharp it's a discerner see and that's what the the word they want to go down and discern us it discern what your needs are and god begin to meet the needs through the preaching of the word but you know the spirit of god does that you know as i just was absorbing the net you know i just been telling brother earnest you know how the lord blessed and and different women were calling and said oh my how they really needed you know what was said you know i say you know we need you know god you know to speak to the people needs but you got to have an ear to hear what the spirit is saying you got to know when is the holy ghost or not you got to know that uh what you need is not just man preaching good words but you need the spirit of god to quicken that word that the word come alive and when they come alive it'll do something in you it'll change you it'll cause you you need to repent to repent whatever it need that's what the word come to do see when it's preached under the right inspiration of the holy ghost oh yes i realize you know that more and more how urgent it is for us as people of god to understand the leadership of the holy ghost and from the leadership of a man now i want to read something and i'm going to come to a little halt here in it but i want to get this out because that spirit that the servant of god says now whatever that spirit was doing back then he said it's doing it now it was taking the people from the leadership of the holy ghost to a man man-made ideas and uh all and blending in with all kind of political stuff and mixing it all up and then just throwing it into the church see the devil know what he's doing you know about you know he's crafty he's smart he's very intelligent he knows how to uh make things look like his god and then the people are not spiritually minded to discern what really is going they think that oh that's god and don't understand that when you start twisting the word and mixing the word then you didn't kill the effect of it and see eve thought really what she had was right she thought what she had gotten she refund adam and all adam look what i got she thought she had a new revelation didn't even know she was deceived by a cunning spirit that had moved in on her and she had no idea oh my i wonder sometimes do we really understand who is leading us this see how it started out in the early church it was called deeds in the pergamos it became a doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over and god was pushed aside oh my push god all the way out oh it started so small so quietly so inefficiently it looks so good it seemed so sound that it caught a hold and like a parthon and squeeze out every breath and kill all the spirit spirituality there was in the church that's what the devil want to do now he want to kill all the spirituality in the church and give the people uh emotion excitement you know a good singing nothing wrong with those things but we need the holy ghost we need god's spirit and to know that you know it's god that's in control not this man preaching thing that's good but a man that has been uh in the presence of god that has gotten a word from god because if not did it just good sermons and people get excited we we feel good but then no yoke's been broken no deliverance into people's lives you leave out you know uh just like you came in you feel a little better but after tomorrow it's gone but we need more than that we need something that we can take home that we can get somewhere in our clothing and say lord help me i heard a word from you tonight lord and i need deliverance i need yolks broken i need my family seed i need the holy ghost because we tired just coming to a church gathering i'm telling you the truth to church has become so uh ritual you know tuesday or wednesday or friday or sunday and but where's the changes because god wants to change us the word is supposed to have a liberty to search us out to break us up sometimes it cuts it rebukes but yet it also heals yeah it cuts some time to hear it but it'll do you good you got to understand when that come god he's working on you he's telling you i love you that's why i'm correcting you that's why i'm showing you this is what you need it's not the money it's not the education but you need me you need the spirit of god to show you what i want done and that's what we need until then until we really get to the place to you know to really understand you know it takes something to get something you know it takes something to get something but i say this you know i'm finding out that whatever is being preached to the people that's what they're going to grab hold of if it's just good quotes or if it's just good information they'll get that but then they'll find out that that won't keep them they need something that's going to keep them and no pastor can keep them no church can keep them but the holy ghost is a keeper that's why more and brother was saying that we have got to get uh uh something from god to be able to get the people back into the mode of the holy ghost because without it their backslide nothing else we preach know that we got to preach every all these things but i mean nothing is more urgency to a church of believers is getting them to the holy ghost it's urgent to me it's one of the the greatest message that ever been brought forth i be brother branham said that of jesus first doctrine he preached to the church was you must be born again i believe that ought to be our first message until we get the people to uh that literary life of god and they crying out for it night and day everything else we are preaching almost be secondary they have a lot of information of things that they've read and things that they have heard but we need more every time you i talk the people that were saying they want more god they want more god but my thought is but then you need the holy ghost because if you get that the holy ghost you'll find out that he's all you need in him is everything it's your joy it's your peace it's your revival it's your teacher he's your god he's your protector he's your provider he's everything he even be a mama when your mom lives a father when you're fatherless what he wants to be god bless you tonight god is good amen we appreciate the word today praise god i thought about it the song said he never failed me yet and everywhere i go i want the world to know jesus christ never failed me yet appreciate the word amen god's servant says the purpose is to pick up your pen and write and when he wrote he dwelled about a a people that would come on the scene that would be a super race a super people that have come into the very image of god the very image of god i said that's what it was all about the purpose was of eve was to reproduce adam who was adam and god made man in his own image what are we in this last days what a god what is the purpose of the bride is to reproduce him the last adam which is christ we are to come in his very image we are to be just like him are you with me so we're the word bride he was the manifestation of god god was manifested in the flesh he was the very word of god being made manifest amen so john said that which we have looked upon that which we have heard that's what with our hands we've handled is the word of life the very word of god had become flesh dwelt among us we beheld the glory of the glory and the only begotten of the father we saw god we saw god and we handled it amen we saw him with our eyes with our five senses we saw the word we saw the very image we saw the very expression we saw the very mind of god expressed and became flesh god came now amen we saw god again what the world looking for a superman but what is god calling its people to his very image the purpose of eve was to reproduce adam the purpose of the bride is to reproduce christ amen sons and daughters of god in the very image of god amen that's what we are to reproduce him that very image we see jesus again we see christ in bradford oh yes amen we must come in that very image because we are to be one by his wife amen and he was the word we must become they meant so much like him that he and she are one father make them one that's what it's all about brother that's what is all about sister maybe the very image is very light in the oneness with god oh yes we're in the last days god calling a people there must be a deep cry not calling to the deed calling us to come in that very image oh yes we can't be satisfied we're just going to churches uh but the jeremiah is saying we can't be satisfied with just singing a song amen that deep calling to the deep oh close to d oh i want to be closer and closer oh something inside of you somebody said i feel the pool they meant something is calling me to hire calling and sister oh yes i hear myself and they're calling me come up a little higher till that god pay love come on up into the perfect word amen amen come on up since angela you know that song i hear my theophy they call me you know that song just come up and sing
