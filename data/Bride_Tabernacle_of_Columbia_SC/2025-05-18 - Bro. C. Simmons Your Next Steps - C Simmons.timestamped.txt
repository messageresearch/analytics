[32:26] gathered in my name, there you would be
[32:27] in the midst. So Lord, we know that
[32:29] you're here this morning. Lord, we ask
[32:31] that you just move us out of the way.
[32:33] Lord, we thank you for blessing the song
[32:35] service this morning. Lord, we ask that
[32:37] you to touch those that are here and
[32:39] Lord, those that are not here and Lord,
[32:41] just send a word to them and Lord, may
[32:43] you meet all the needs today. In Jesus
[32:45] name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you
[32:49] have your Bibles this morning, we'll
[32:51] turn to 1 Coronicles the 14th chapter.
[33:10] I think we're going to start at verse
[33:18] eight. And when you got it, say
[33:23] amen. 1 Coronicles the 14th chapter
[33:27] starting at verse 8. And when the
[33:29] Philistines heard that David was
[33:32] anointed king over all Israel, all the
[33:36] Philistines went up to seek David. And
[33:39] David heard of it and went out against
[33:41] them. And the Philistines came and
[33:43] spread themselves in the valley
[33:46] of Rafi. And David inquired of inquired
[33:50] of God, saying, Shall I go up against
[33:53] the Philistines, and will thou deliver
[33:55] them into my hand? And the Lord said
[33:59] unto him, "Go up, for I will deliver
[34:01] them into thine hand." So they came to
[34:04] Ba Pere Perez and and David smoked them
[34:09] there. Then David said, "God has broken
[34:13] in upon my enemies by mine hand like the
[34:16] breaking forth of waters." Therefore
[34:18] they called the name of that place Bale
[34:21] Perez. And when they had left their gods
[34:24] there, David gave a commandment, and
[34:26] they were burned with fire. And the
[34:29] Philistines yet again spread themselves
[34:31] abroad in the valley. Therefore David
[34:34] inquired again of the Lord. And God said
[34:36] unto him, "Go not up after them. Turn
[34:40] away from them, and come upon them over
[34:43] against the mo the malberry trees." And
[34:46] it was and it shall be when thou shalt
[34:48] hear a sound of going in the top of the
[34:51] malberry trees that then there shall go
[34:55] out of
[34:56] the thou shalt go out to battle for God
[35:00] is gone forth before thee to smite the
[35:03] host of the Philistines. And David
[35:05] therefore did as God commanded him. And
[35:07] they smoked the host of the Philistines
[35:10] from Gideon even to Gazer. And the fame
[35:13] of David went out into all the lands,
[35:16] and the Lord brought the fear of him
[35:18] upon all the nations. Amen. God bless
[35:20] the reading of this word. You may be
[35:22] seated this morning.
[35:25] Amen. Amen. This morning, I'd like to
[35:29] speak on a little topic that I
[35:31] entitled I entitled it your next
[35:34] steps. Your next steps. And if I had a
[35:37] subtopic this morning, I would entitle
[35:40] it, don't forget God.
[35:43] Don't forget God. And and I like this
[35:45] story in David how that every time he
[35:47] went to fight his enemy, he went to God
[35:50] in prayer. Every time he he went to he
[35:53] went to go fight these Philistines. He
[35:55] didn't just go because he wanted to do
[35:57] something. He didn't just go because he
[36:00] felt like doing this. He didn't just go
[36:02] because the Philistines were there. He
[36:04] went to God and said, "Lord, should I go
[36:06] up against them? Lord, should I go and
[36:08] should I go fight my enemy?" Sometimes
[36:10] the enemy can be right in front of you,
[36:12] but it's not the time to fight. Sometime
[36:15] the enemy can be right there, but it's
[36:17] not the time to fight. See, God, if you
[36:20] read in the the first time when David
[36:22] went to when David went to God, God
[36:24] said, "Go ahead, fight him, cuz yeah,
[36:26] I'm going to give you the victory." But
[36:28] the next time when the Philistines were
[36:30] there cuz the enemy came back again.
[36:33] Many of times you can face an enemy and
[36:35] you think that you defeated them and the
[36:36] enemy had come back and and you think
[36:39] that you done overcome and all but the
[36:41] enemy will come back and the enemy was
[36:44] ready to attack again and David thought
[36:46] David he didn't decide you know what
[36:48] I've already defeated this enemy let me
[36:50] go fight him and defeat him he went to
[36:52] God and said Lord what would you have me
[36:54] do you can't just sometimes go up just
[36:57] because you done defeated the enemy once
[36:59] and say this going to be the same battle
[37:01] cuz sometimes it might be something
[37:03] different. But this time, the Lord
[37:04] wanted him to wait because if you read
[37:06] down further, he said the Lord went
[37:08] before him and smoke the enemy before
[37:11] David even the Lord wanted him to make
[37:14] sure that he got that he got all the
[37:17] other destruction this time. He he
[37:19] wanted to go before him and already
[37:21] defeat the enemy so that when the battle
[37:23] beca came to him, it would be easy. It
[37:26] didn't matter how David had already, he
[37:28] might have thought, I can use the same
[37:30] strategy I did last time. But God had a
[37:33] way to say, "No, I want this battle to
[37:35] be easy for you." So David had to go to
[37:38] him first before he took his next steps,
[37:40] he had to go to God and say, Lord, what
[37:42] step should I take? Lord, before I take
[37:45] my next step, Lord, what step should I
[37:47] take? And and that's why I had the
[37:49] subtopic, don't forget God. Because
[37:52] sometimes you might be ready to take a
[37:54] step, but you didn't inquire of God.
[37:56] Lord, what step should I take? Lord,
[37:58] what should I do next? You you ready cuz
[38:00] you see the enemy is there and say and
[38:03] say, I know that he's defeated the
[38:04] enemy, but God is asking you, what what
[38:07] will you require, Lord? What would you
[38:09] have me do?
[38:11] Lord, what step would you have me take
[38:13] next? Cuz this step didn't seem like he
[38:16] was going for the enemy. He said, go
[38:18] over here to the side. Amen. He didn't
[38:20] tell him to go straight on. He said, "Go
[38:22] over here and wait a little while." God
[38:24] had given him the victory. He knew that
[38:26] the devil couldn't defeat him, but God
[38:28] still wanted him to pay attention and
[38:30] say, "No, I want to see what you going
[38:32] to do. I'm going to bring the enemy back
[38:35] that you've already defeated to see if
[38:37] you going to come to me again this time.
[38:39] To see if you going to come to me and
[38:41] ask me, Lord, what would you have have
[38:43] me to do? And then, will you listen to
[38:45] what I got to say?" Amen. Cuz many of
[38:48] times you can go to God, but then you
[38:49] get tired of waiting on God. So you do
[38:51] your own thing. Amen. But God want the
[38:54] battle that when you fight it, it's
[38:56] going to be easy. Amen. He want you to
[38:58] come and say, "Lord, what would you have
[38:59] my next step to be?" Uh this morning, I
[39:03] was reminded that we have many graduates
[39:05] this morning. So we we just want to
[39:08] congratulate y'all and may the Lord be
[39:10] with you in your next steps. And I
[39:12] thought about th this thing as you take
[39:14] life journey. Life is life is full of
[39:17] steps. Amen. Every part of life is a is
[39:20] a step. Every part of life is one step
[39:23] in your journey called life. And I
[39:26] started thinking about it and I said,
[39:27] you know, life is like this. When when
[39:30] you start your life, there's there's a
[39:32] book that's written and it's got your
[39:34] name on it. And this is the book of your
[39:37] life. And in this book of your life,
[39:39] there's an introduction, there's a
[39:41] middle part, and there's a conclusion.
[39:44] And some some people like stories. If
[39:46] you ever read a book, sometimes some
[39:48] books don't end the way that you think
[39:50] they going to end. If you ever read a
[39:52] book, some books don't end the way that
[39:54] you you as you reading the story, you
[39:57] surmise, I know what's going to happen.
[39:59] I know exactly what's going to happen.
[40:01] And then the book takes a twist and a
[40:03] turn. And sometimes life is just like
[40:06] that. Amen. And every every book is not
[40:08] written the same. Amen. You can see some
[40:10] similarities between this one and this
[40:12] and that one, but it's not the same
[40:14] story. And some they might have
[40:16] different characters, might have the
[40:18] same plot, but it's a different story.
[40:20] And just like that, that's like each and
[40:22] every one of our lives. And and some
[40:25] some I I thought about it and you say,
[40:27] well, some people they don't they don't
[40:29] get the ending that you thought. Well,
[40:31] sometimes the book is left in a
[40:32] cliffhanger.
[40:35] But the difference is with your life
[40:37] story book there there's no sequels
[40:41] there. There there's either there
[40:42] there's a there's a beginning and
[40:44] there's a end until you cross over and
[40:47] then there you got one or two choices
[40:49] where you going to end up but there
[40:51] there there's a place that the end of it
[40:53] is either you end in heaven or you end
[40:55] in a different place and you know where
[40:58] the place is. So, and I thought about
[41:01] how that each one of our life's journey
[41:03] and I said in the journey, there are
[41:05] chapters in the book. There's chapters
[41:08] in the book and maybe if you look back
[41:10] in your life, you'll see that if you
[41:12] lived a little while, you realize, well,
[41:14] this was this this kind of go together.
[41:16] Y'all can block it. That was a chapter,
[41:19] but it wasn't the end of my story. And
[41:22] see, sometimes we think that while we in
[41:25] the midst of a chapter, it's the end of
[41:27] the story. Amen. And we get caught up
[41:29] because we're fighting something that we
[41:31] thinking is the end of the story where
[41:33] it's just part of a chapter. And
[41:35] sometimes it we done magnified it so big
[41:38] that it's the end of the story when it's
[41:40] part of a paragraph. It's not even the
[41:42] end of a chapter. It's just part of the
[41:44] paragraph. But we got so focused in on
[41:47] the as and the that we missed the we
[41:49] miss the larger picture. We miss what
[41:52] God can do because we so focused on just
[41:55] this one little sentence in a big
[41:57] paragraph. And God has a way that he
[42:00] said, "No, I know the beginning from the
[42:02] end. I knew when you would start and I
[42:04] knew when you would finish." And see,
[42:06] he's got the whole book in his hands. So
[42:09] if he knows the beginning, the end, why
[42:11] wouldn't you go to the writer of the
[42:13] book and ask him, "Lord, what step
[42:15] should I take next?" Amen. Amen. And the
[42:18] pastor said something on Friday that
[42:20] that stuck with me and I thought about
[42:22] it. I said, you know, God is the only
[42:24] one that can erase part of the story.
[42:27] When you give your life to God, he can
[42:29] erase the bad things in the story. Amen.
[42:33] That he's the only one that can wash you
[42:35] white as snow. He's the only one that
[42:37] can use white out in your story. And
[42:40] see, when you see, you missing you're
[42:42] missing the greatest part if you don't
[42:44] ever get God. If you don't ever give
[42:46] your life to him, you miss the one that
[42:48] can take out all the bad things in your
[42:50] story. Amen. But you see, if you give
[42:53] your life to God, he can use that white
[42:55] out and wash it white as snow. All the
[42:57] bad, he can say, "I make it in the
[42:59] good." He said, "I all things work
[43:01] together to the good to them that love
[43:03] him, to them that is called according to
[43:06] his purpose." See, but it's all a part
[43:08] of your story. Amen. See, one day when
[43:10] you get there and you and he's sitting
[43:12] on judgment seat, he's going to pick up
[43:14] your book and he said, "Let's read."
[43:19] And he's and your whole story, even the
[43:22] thoughts in your mind going to be in
[43:24] this book. Amen. Of your story. Amen.
[43:27] But see, you have an opportunity to
[43:29] figure out how you want the end of your
[43:31] story to be. Amen. You got an
[43:34] opportunity every day that God put
[43:36] breath in your body to to choose and
[43:38] say, "Lord, this I want my story to end
[43:41] in a good story." Not everybody might
[43:44] end in a good story. But you got to
[43:46] recogn
[43:53] But that's your choice. Amen. But I I
[43:56] started to think about it. I said, "Each
[43:58] each paragraph is just a different
[44:00] step." And sometimes you can think of
[44:03] it, well when I was this age, I went
[44:05] through this this well where I went to
[44:07] school from this age to this age. That
[44:09] was that was just a chapter cuz it was a
[44:12] whole rest of life that you had to work
[44:14] for this amount of time. And if the Lord
[44:16] blessed you enough, then you might end
[44:18] up retiring. You can put them into
[44:20] different sections of your of just cha
[44:22] chapters in your life. And and I thought
[44:25] about it. I was reading something the
[44:26] prophet of God said and he said about
[44:28] Moses. Moses had different chapters in
[44:31] his life. He had the first 40 years
[44:33] where he was in Egypt and he was growing
[44:35] and he was learning until he killed the
[44:37] Egyptian. Then it was a new chapter
[44:40] change. He went running in the
[44:41] wilderness and he was in the wilderness
[44:43] for 40 years hurting sheep just doing a
[44:46] regular job. And then God got the
[44:48] burning bush to catch his attention. And
[44:50] the last 40 years that was that was the
[44:52] end of a chapter. Then the next one when
[44:54] God sent the burning bush to catch his
[44:56] attention that he that was a new chapter
[44:59] where he was going to lead the children
[45:01] of Israel all the way up to the promised
[45:03] land. Amen. Those those were just
[45:05] chapters in Moses life. Now some people
[45:07] think after he killed the Egyptian
[45:09] that's the end of his story but it
[45:10] wasn't. Amen. Some people might have
[45:13] said well once he got out there he got
[45:15] married he settled down that might have
[45:17] you might have thought that was the end
[45:18] of the story but it wasn't. There was a
[45:20] work God had for him to do since he was
[45:23] in his youth. Amen. But the choices that
[45:26] he made caused it to change his story.
[45:29] Amen. The choices that he made caused
[45:32] him to detour and go out in the
[45:33] wilderness for 40 years. Amen. When he
[45:36] could have he could have already done
[45:38] been and maybe might have would have
[45:40] answered, but that's not how God wanted
[45:42] to write that story. Amen. See,
[45:45] sometimes your story is not how you
[45:46] configure it, but it's how God wants it
[45:49] to be written. Amen. See, Moses thought,
[45:51] "I'm going to kill them and they going
[45:52] to back me up and we going to take over
[45:54] the kingdom." But that's not how it
[45:55] happened. Amen. That's not how it
[45:57] happened because it was different than
[45:59] Moses thought in his head because Moses
[46:02] wasn't the writer of his story. Amen.
[46:06] Sometimes you get in life and you think
[46:07] about it and you might think, well, I'm
[46:09] going to write this chapter in my life
[46:13] story cuz I'm going to make this
[46:15] decision and this decision which going
[46:17] to cause this to happen and then maybe 3
[46:19] to 5 to 10 years it's going to have a
[46:22] different ending than than it look like
[46:23] it's going right
[46:25] now. But if God is the author of your
[46:28] story,
[46:30] God is the author of each and every one
[46:32] of our stories. The way that you think
[46:35] that you going to see sometimes when
[46:37] they write a book, they don't just write
[46:38] the book and then they go print the
[46:40] book. No, they have what they call a
[46:42] rough
[46:43] draft. And sometimes we over there
[46:45] trying to type out our rough draft and
[46:47] turn it in and submit it and say it's
[46:49] done. You ever wrote a paper one time
[46:52] and you wrote the rough draft and say
[46:53] it's good enough to be the final? Some
[46:56] some people that's what they do. They
[46:58] they think they're good enough writers
[46:59] to write it one time and it ain't got no
[47:01] mistakes in it.
[47:03] But see, that's how it would be if we
[47:05] tried to write our own story. It'd be
[47:08] full of mistakes. It'd be full of things
[47:10] that we had no clue about that's coming
[47:12] up ahead that we are not prepared for.
[47:15] But we done wrote this story. And who
[47:17] knows something in part of that story
[47:19] that's coming up ahead can take us
[47:21] straight on out. That's why God wrote
[47:23] the story. That's why he wrote the story
[47:26] of your life. That's why he knew all the
[47:28] pitfalls that was coming and said, "No,
[47:30] I need you to stand over here, David,
[47:33] because I got something that I want to
[47:35] do to these Philistines." Before you get
[47:38] to them, I want to go ahead and run
[47:40] before you take care of them for you so
[47:42] the battle is easy when you get there.
[47:44] Amen. Amen. See, he David had to go and
[47:47] say, "Lord, what steps would you have me
[47:49] take next?" Amen. And it didn't matter
[47:51] how many times David had come to to that
[47:54] battle, David, each time he went to God
[47:56] and said, "Lord, what step would you
[47:58] have me do next?" Amen. See, God has a
[48:01] way of of making sure that he is
[48:03] ordering your steps. But if he's
[48:06] ordering your steps, why don't you go to
[48:07] him and say, "Lord, show me the steps
[48:10] that you want me to take." Lord, I'm
[48:12] going to sit here and wait until you
[48:14] answer my request. Lord, I'm going to
[48:16] sit here and wait and I'm going to pray
[48:17] and get down on my knees and I'm Lord, I
[48:20] want to know what step you would have me
[48:22] take next. Cuz I could go do a thing,
[48:24] but it would not lead to the victory
[48:26] that I'm thinking it might lead to. Cuz
[48:28] I'm trying to write my own story. I'm
[48:31] trying to over here trying to write this
[48:33] draft and submit it. Well, I'm not the
[48:35] author of my own story. I'm not the one
[48:38] that writes my life story, but he's the
[48:40] one that knows the beginning and the
[48:41] end. And as he writes it, he can know
[48:44] how to skip this and mark out that and
[48:46] and correct this and correct that and
[48:48] make this wrong right and make this and
[48:51] make these things work out to the good
[48:53] of my story. And said, I might try to do
[48:56] it myself, but that would do it no
[48:58] justice. That'll do no things because
[49:00] God has a way of doing the right thing
[49:03] even when I don't think it's right. God
[49:06] has a way of closing this door to open
[49:08] another door wide open because I thought
[49:10] this the door I'm supposed to go through
[49:13] because I'm trying to understand how to
[49:15] write my own story instead of going to
[49:17] him and said, "Lord, what would you have
[49:19] step would you have me take next?" What
[49:22] step would you have me take next? And
[49:24] and this is this was something in my own
[49:26] life that I experienced.
[49:29] I got to this thing and I thought I was
[49:31] going to have an opportunity to go
[49:33] somewhere and I thought that everything
[49:35] had lined up for me to have the
[49:36] opportunity to go there. I thought,
[49:40] well, I missed it at this time where God
[49:42] seemed to close the door. And so I said,
[49:45] well, this another chance at this
[49:47] opportunity. And so I went there and
[49:50] then right before I thought I was going
[49:52] to walk through this door, God shut it
[49:55] again. And I I don't know why he shut
[49:58] it. I don't know why he decided that's
[50:00] the door, but he didn't want me to go
[50:02] through it because he made it in a way
[50:03] that it was a decision out of my
[50:05] control.
[50:07] See, that's what happens when God write
[50:08] your story and you say, "Lord, close
[50:11] every door that I'm not supposed to go
[50:13] through." When you pray that prayer,
[50:15] sometimes you won't end up in places you
[50:17] won't end up in parts of things that you
[50:19] wrote in your story. Sometimes we try to
[50:22] amend our story. We try to add to our
[50:24] story by saying, "No, we going to do
[50:26] this and it's going to happen. But if
[50:28] God wrote your story, there's nothing
[50:30] that he wants you to do that you you
[50:33] ain't going to be able to do it. If you
[50:35] if you pray to him and he wants to block
[50:37] that door, it's just like Noah in that
[50:39] ark. No matter how hard they tried, they
[50:41] couldn't get in there. No matter how how
[50:44] bad Noah wanted them to get in the ark
[50:47] and might have was trying to push it
[50:48] open for him that he couldn't budge that
[50:50] door cuz he he didn't close the door.
[50:53] God did. And so I thought that I was
[50:56] going on this path and I was going to be
[50:58] able to and God shut that path
[51:01] down. Now he made a alternate
[51:04] path which I didn't expect, didn't know
[51:08] nothing about because when he writes the
[51:10] story, he make it better than you ever
[51:12] could have thought it would be. That's
[51:14] the difference when he's writing the
[51:16] story. He made it better than I thought
[51:18] it. Now I don't know what the experience
[51:20] that I missed because I missed it. But
[51:23] it ain't a part of it wasn't a part of
[51:25] my story for now. God could open it in
[51:27] the future and say it's the right time
[51:29] for you to go go on this path, but it
[51:32] wasn't the time for it. The first time
[51:33] it wasn't. The second time it wasn't. We
[51:36] don't know what the future may hold. But
[51:38] see, that's the difference when you let
[51:40] God write your story. And when God wrote
[51:42] the story, I experienced things. I went
[51:45] places. I did things that I can only
[51:47] look back and say, "Wow, that was such a
[51:49] great blessing to me. Wow, that was
[51:52] something that I never would have done
[51:53] if God hadn't closed that door. I would
[51:56] never would have had this experience if
[51:58] God wouldn't have closed his door. If he
[52:00] hadn't wrote this in my story, I never
[52:02] would have went on this path because I
[52:04] had this way that I thought that I was
[52:06] going. I had this path that I thought
[52:09] that was the step I was going to take.
[52:12] That was the step that I was going to
[52:13] make because I I was going to try to
[52:15] write this part into my story cuz I felt
[52:18] like it was the time to do it.
[52:20] Sometimes you get to a point and you
[52:22] feel well I I I haven't been through
[52:24] this or haven't done so I'm going to
[52:26] write this step into my
[52:29] story when you didn't go to like David
[52:32] did and he inquired of God Lord what
[52:34] step should I take amen because if you
[52:37] have went to him sometimes God is say
[52:39] that ain't the time it ain't the time
[52:41] for you to go on that step amen it ain't
[52:44] the time that step is actually five or
[52:46] 10 steps from where you are right now
[52:49] and if I hit you on that stair. You'll
[52:51] be trying to stretch, stretch, stretch,
[52:53] and you might miss it. Amen. You might
[52:56] try to stretch, stretch. You ever try to
[52:58] go up and see how many steps you can
[53:00] climb up at
[53:01] once? You tried to stretch your leg and
[53:03] see how many steps you can climb up at
[53:05] once. Maybe when you was younger or
[53:07] something. See, I I'm I'm going to try
[53:09] I'm going to try to step as high as I
[53:11] can and see. Sometimes you you shooting
[53:13] for the fifth one, end up on the fourth
[53:15] one.
[53:17] Or sometimes you shoot for the third
[53:18] one, end up on the second one and
[53:20] realize I can't really stretch as far as
[53:22] I thought I could. And see, God knows
[53:25] how far you can stretch. God knows
[53:28] everything that that he has for you. And
[53:30] he'll say, "Listen, you trying to get
[53:33] somewhere that a that you ain't ready
[53:35] for. You trying to go down a path that
[53:38] you ain't ready for, but you think
[53:40] because I've experienced enough, I'm
[53:42] going to write this into my story." But
[53:45] God said, "No, there's some chapter.
[53:47] There might be a paragraph m maybe even
[53:50] a chapter before he got that in your
[53:52] story. It might be in your story, but
[53:54] it's further down the line, further down
[53:57] the plotline of your story when you are
[53:59] ready for it." Amen. Amen. But if you
[54:02] try to rush that thing, you you that's
[54:05] why that's why I wrote I said it's
[54:07] important that you don't forget God.
[54:09] Amen. It's important that while you on
[54:12] your journey that you don't forget God.
[54:14] Amen. That while you taking your steps,
[54:17] you go to him and say, "Lord, what might
[54:19] might I have do?" Prophet of God said,
[54:21] he said, "Give me a preacher. Give me a
[54:22] Christian. Give me a housewife that's a
[54:25] Christian. Give me a farmer or a factory
[54:27] worker that will put God first in
[54:30] everything." Amen. Yeah. He said, "I'll
[54:33] show you a man I'll show you a man that
[54:36] will be successful in in spite of all
[54:40] the devil can put on him." Amen. That's
[54:43] it. Amen. Amen. He said he said, "Get I
[54:48] want to read that again." He said, "Give
[54:50] me someone that will put God first in
[54:53] everything." Amen. And he said, "I'll
[54:55] show you a man that will be successful
[54:58] in spite of all the devil can put on
[55:00] you." Amen. Amen. Just think of that.
[55:02] All you had to do was put God first.
[55:04] That's it. Amen. All you had to do was
[55:06] put God as the head of your life. And he
[55:09] said, "I'll show you someone that would
[55:11] be a successful
[55:13] said some people was looking for this to
[55:14] do and this to do to be successful when
[55:17] all you had to do was put God first."
[55:19] Amen. When all you had to do was say,
[55:22] "Lord, I want you to be in control of my
[55:24] life." and and I he said, "I'll show you
[55:26] someone that will be successful in spite
[55:29] of all the devil can put on you." Amen.
[55:32] Now, if I'm going to go through life and
[55:34] the devil's still going to bother me,
[55:35] why wouldn't I go to God and give it to
[55:37] him? Amen. Cuz whether you whether
[55:41] whether you live for God or not, the
[55:42] devil still going to bother you. Amen.
[55:45] Come on now. Whether you live for God or
[55:47] not, the devil's still going to come to
[55:48] you and attack you and take you through
[55:51] things. Amen.
[55:53] So if I'm going to go through things,
[55:55] why don't I go to God and say, "Lord,
[55:57] you the only one that can defeat the
[55:59] devil. I'm not strong enough. He been
[56:01] studying for all eternity and all
[56:04] through time, through my family history,
[56:06] and through time, and he coming against
[56:08] me. So why would I go to the one that
[56:11] can lift up a standard against them? Why
[56:14] wouldn't I go to the one and say, "Lord,
[56:16] I want to be successful." Amen. I don't
[56:19] know anyone that doesn't want to be
[56:21] successful. Well, if someone comes to
[56:23] you and say, "Here, this is the keys to
[56:26] success and they give them to you." Now,
[56:29] it's what do you do with them? Amen. Cuz
[56:32] I can put all the keys in your hands and
[56:34] say, "Here outside of this key go to the
[56:37] Lamborghini. This key go to the $5
[56:39] million mansion and this key goes to
[56:41] this key right here goes to a safety
[56:43] deposit box with $10 million of gold."
[56:46] Now, if I put them in your hand and say,
[56:48] "Here, it's yours."
[56:51] I have no idea what you do with
[56:54] it. If you never use the keys, you'll
[56:58] never get any benefits from having those
[57:01] keys. If you never use those keys, then
[57:04] you'll have no benefit. Even though
[57:06] somebody told you everything these keys
[57:08] go to this, you can go outside and see
[57:11] it sometimes. And some people might not
[57:14] I I ain't going to do nothing with it.
[57:16] It's just like the story that he said he
[57:18] gave one five talents, one three and one
[57:20] one and one with the one he went and
[57:23] buried it. Some people are just like
[57:25] that. If someone tells them here's the
[57:28] keys to success. Here you
[57:30] go. It's what you do with the keys. I
[57:34] can't I can't tell you what you do with
[57:36] the key. I got to do with it for myself.
[57:39] If God gives me the keys to success,
[57:41] what it's up to me decide what I want it
[57:44] to look like.
[57:46] Some people, they'll get those three
[57:48] keys and all they wanted was the
[57:50] car. They didn't want the house. They
[57:53] didn't want the uh all all they wanted
[57:55] was what they could see because they had
[57:57] to drive to the
[57:59] house. They had to drive to the bank to
[58:01] get to the safety deposit bar. So, all
[58:03] they wanted was what they could see.
[58:05] Now, somebody else, they say, "You know
[58:07] what? Let me go see if this house is
[58:10] real." All they wanted was the house and
[58:12] the car. But the difference is there
[58:15] somebody else that said, "You know what?
[58:17] Let me go see if if the car is real and
[58:21] the house is real. Now, let me go see if
[58:23] the if the money in the bank cuz
[58:25] somebody else would say, you know what?
[58:27] I don't just want peace of my blessing.
[58:30] I don't just want part of my blessing. I
[58:32] want the whole thing. I want everything
[58:34] that's in store for me." And if that's
[58:37] what's in store for me, I'm If the keys
[58:39] is right here, all I got to do is go get
[58:41] it. All I got to do is go access it. All
[58:44] I got to do is realize that God has
[58:46] changed my life. See, that's what type
[58:49] of blessings God can do in your life.
[58:51] See, I made it up as an example, but
[58:53] that's how God moves. Sometimes he'll
[58:55] walk to you and he'll give you something
[58:57] that others may work all their life
[58:59] trying to achieve. Amen. Amen. Amen. And
[59:02] you'll look and say, "I don't know how I
[59:04] got here. It was only by the grace of
[59:06] God. I don't know how I achieved it. It
[59:09] was only by the grace of God. See, I
[59:11] went and he ordered my steps. And I
[59:13] asked God what steps to take next. And
[59:15] now I ended up here. And I don't know
[59:17] how I got here, but it was by the grace
[59:19] of God. See, I got out of my story. And
[59:21] I let him write my story. I got out of
[59:24] the way of him in my story. And I let
[59:26] him write my story. And I asked him,
[59:28] Lord, what's the next part of my story?
[59:30] And sometimes he would give me the whole
[59:32] thing. And sometimes he only say, take
[59:34] one step further. Sometimes he'd only
[59:37] say say one step further. But guess
[59:39] what? I went to him and asked him which
[59:40] step to take. And when I went to him, he
[59:44] gave me the answer that I needed to take
[59:46] the next step. He didn't show me five
[59:48] years down the road. He said just take
[59:49] this one step. And sometimes while you
[59:52] standing on that one step, you the devil
[59:54] is going to come and test you. The devil
[59:56] is going to come and try you. But when
[59:58] you ask God what step to take, you can
[1:00:01] stand on that step and say, "God put me
[1:00:03] here. God put me here. The devil can't
[1:00:06] take me back cuz God put me here. right
[1:00:08] here on this step. And if he put me on
[1:00:11] this step, I know I can't go back. I
[1:00:13] know that there's something greater cuz
[1:00:15] there's another step. God ain't showed
[1:00:16] me what it was. But while I'm on this
[1:00:19] step, I can have faith that Lord, you
[1:00:20] put me here. So the devil can't knock me
[1:00:24] off this step. There wasn't nothing the
[1:00:26] de the Philistines could do to make
[1:00:28] David move out of them trees. There
[1:00:31] wasn't nothing they could do cuz God had
[1:00:33] told him, "Go here and wait." And
[1:00:36] sometimes God will put you on a step and
[1:00:37] say, "Wait." And while you waiting, the
[1:00:40] devil is attacking. While you waiting,
[1:00:42] every he every devil in hell is coming
[1:00:44] at you. But when God placed you on that
[1:00:46] step, all you got to do is stand firm.
[1:00:49] Don't turn around. He didn't give you
[1:00:50] armor for your back. He said, "Continue
[1:00:52] to fight on." All you got to fight on
[1:00:54] and stand where he placed you cuz one
[1:00:57] day he going to allow you. He said,
[1:00:58] "Now, now it's time. Go ahead and defeat
[1:01:00] them all. Go ahead and defeat them all
[1:01:02] from this place all the way back to
[1:01:04] their homeland. Go ahead and take them
[1:01:06] all.
[1:01:07] [Applause]
[1:01:09] See, when God gives you that next step,
[1:01:10] it's for you to stand there. And if the
[1:01:13] devil comes to fight and stand, but not
[1:01:15] to necessarily move forward until he
[1:01:17] tells you go forward. Amen. And when he
[1:01:19] tell you to go forward, you know there's
[1:01:21] nothing that's going to stand in front
[1:01:23] of you. You might take off running,
[1:01:24] skipping, hopping, and jumping because
[1:01:26] God doesn't allowed you to say, "You
[1:01:28] know what? You got it now. It's all
[1:01:30] yours. Whatever you wanted, God done
[1:01:32] gave it to you because it was right
[1:01:34] there in front of you. All the devils
[1:01:36] and all the enemies can't come against
[1:01:38] you now. Amen. Just because you said,
[1:01:40] "Lord, what step should I take?" Amen.
[1:01:43] See, that thing had a profound effect on
[1:01:45] on them. It had a It had a glorious
[1:01:48] effect. It had something that you didn't
[1:01:50] understand. It was a compound effect. It
[1:01:53] It was a domino effect. He He had to
[1:01:56] wait cuz God was setting up the dominoes
[1:01:58] to fall. Amen. He was setting them up.
[1:02:01] If David would have rushed in there, he
[1:02:03] might have only knocked over one. But
[1:02:06] why while he was over there waiting, God
[1:02:08] done set this one up and set this one up
[1:02:10] and done ran in front of him and scared
[1:02:11] this one and scared that one and put
[1:02:13] fear in the heart cuz God said at the
[1:02:15] end he had put he had allowed fame to
[1:02:18] reach the other nations. God wanted such
[1:02:20] an utter defeat that the other people
[1:02:22] got scared. All the enemies around got
[1:02:25] scared because they realized this wasn't
[1:02:28] just David. This was something greater
[1:02:30] than him. This wasn't just an army. This
[1:02:32] was something greater than them. And if
[1:02:34] we go to fight, we got to come prepared.
[1:02:36] It ain't just we can't go by ourselves
[1:02:38] no more.
[1:02:40] See, the devil had they had to
[1:02:42] re-evaluate their strategy cuz what
[1:02:45] worked one time wasn't going to work no
[1:02:47] more. Amen. What worked last time wasn't
[1:02:49] going to work no more. See, they got
[1:02:51] just defeated the first time when he
[1:02:53] went to him. They he just got defeated
[1:02:56] and and then they they regrouped and
[1:02:57] said, "Let's do this again." But after
[1:03:00] the second time, after David had waited,
[1:03:03] it wasn't no more regrouping to come at
[1:03:05] him again. See, God sometimes he got to
[1:03:07] tell you to wait so that when you go
[1:03:09] fight this time, you don't have to fight
[1:03:11] no more. Amen. He got to tell you to
[1:03:13] wait. That when you go to battle this
[1:03:16] time, you get that victory that you've
[1:03:18] been seeking, you've been desiring,
[1:03:20] you've been waiting on God to do. When
[1:03:22] you go this time is different.
[1:03:26] See, God has a way. Now, when he orders
[1:03:28] your steps, he lines them up in such a
[1:03:30] way that the devil can't do anything to
[1:03:33] stop you. That you look back and you
[1:03:36] say, "How did I get here?" It's only by
[1:03:38] the grace of God. How did I get here?
[1:03:41] It's only by the grace of God. When you
[1:03:44] read when you go back and you think
[1:03:46] about the chapter that just passed in
[1:03:48] your life. Amen. And if you got God
[1:03:51] leading your life, you can go back and
[1:03:53] you can read the story and and and you
[1:03:56] can realize that it was nobody but God
[1:03:59] that wrote that in that story. Cuz if it
[1:04:02] was you, you would have skipped this
[1:04:03] part and skipped that part and skipped
[1:04:05] this part. But if you hadn't gone
[1:04:07] through that, you wouldn't have
[1:04:08] experienced and had the character enough
[1:04:10] to be ready for the next part. Amen.
[1:04:13] Amen. Through a story, they there's
[1:04:16] characters and over time, if it's a good
[1:04:18] character, it gets developed. It don't
[1:04:21] stay stagnant. It doesn't it's just not
[1:04:24] what they start off with. They grow.
[1:04:26] They grow into a greater character. They
[1:04:28] wasn't David didn't didn't stay a little
[1:04:30] boy. He grew into a man. He had his
[1:04:33] issues. He had his problems. But David
[1:04:35] as a person when he got done with the
[1:04:37] story, God said, "That's a man after my
[1:04:39] own heart." Cuz he grew through through
[1:04:42] the ups and the downs and the trials and
[1:04:44] the tribulation. David grew as a
[1:04:46] character. And that's what God tries to
[1:04:48] do in our life. Just the difference is
[1:04:50] we can read David's
[1:04:53] story. But what will we say about
[1:04:56] yours? If we could read your story, what
[1:05:00] will we say say about yours? See, at the
[1:05:02] end of the day, you going to get to a
[1:05:04] place where God is going to read your
[1:05:06] story. And when he reads that story,
[1:05:09] will he come to the conclusion, well
[1:05:11] done, my good and faithful
[1:05:13] servant? Will he come to that
[1:05:16] conclusion? But you see, you get the
[1:05:18] opportunity to say, Lord, what step
[1:05:20] would you have me take? For some of us,
[1:05:23] that's each one of us may be in a
[1:05:25] different part of our lives, but we all
[1:05:27] can ask the same question.
[1:05:30] Some it might be Lord Lord, do you want
[1:05:33] me to give my life to you? I think
[1:05:35] that's a yes. But but that's your
[1:05:38] decision to make. See, God wants you to
[1:05:41] say, "I want you to cast all your cares
[1:05:44] on me for I care for you." See, he he
[1:05:47] has a way of making everything work out
[1:05:49] even when you don't understand how it's
[1:05:52] going to work out because he's writing
[1:05:54] the story. He's over there and he's
[1:05:56] written the story and he knows how the
[1:05:58] paragraph going to go, the page going to
[1:06:00] go and he just waiting on you to say,
[1:06:02] "Lord, what what should I do next?" See,
[1:06:05] when God gives you an understanding of
[1:06:07] what you should do next, you can walk in
[1:06:09] a faith that there's nothing that can
[1:06:11] discourage you on that journey. You can
[1:06:14] walk in a faith and you can you can say,
[1:06:16] "Well, I know that I'm supposed to be
[1:06:17] here because this is what the Lord has.
[1:06:20] I I asked the Lord and the Lord gave me
[1:06:22] a revelation for myself." Now, nobody
[1:06:24] else has to understand your revelation.
[1:06:27] Nobody even some may even may even go
[1:06:31] against what you say. Well, you should
[1:06:32] have done this or you should have done
[1:06:34] that. But you know what? When you get it
[1:06:36] for
[1:06:37] yourself, you can stand on it. You can
[1:06:40] stand on it and say and and when you
[1:06:42] look back, you can say, "I know it was
[1:06:44] the Lord that led me to do this, cuz I
[1:06:47] wouldn't have ended up where I am now if
[1:06:49] he didn't lead me to go through that. if
[1:06:51] he and no matter how hard it gets, if
[1:06:54] God led you to do it, he's going to he's
[1:06:56] going to see you through it. He's going
[1:06:58] to see you right on through it. No
[1:07:00] matter how much the devil fights it,
[1:07:01] he's going to see you through it because
[1:07:03] you asked him, Lord, what step should I
[1:07:05] take? And you waited and God gave you an
[1:07:07] answer. And when he gave you the answer,
[1:07:09] you can stand on it with a conviction
[1:07:11] that you don't you might not even
[1:07:13] understand, but you can stand on it and
[1:07:15] say, "This is where God placed me to
[1:07:17] be." Amen. Amen. the R when when they
[1:07:20] was on on that boat on the water, the
[1:07:24] storm was raging, but it was where they
[1:07:26] were supposed to be. Jesus was in the
[1:07:28] ship with them and all he had to do was
[1:07:31] wake up and say, "Peace be still." And
[1:07:34] all the ways and the storm storm calmed
[1:07:36] down, but they were supposed to be there
[1:07:38] because it was a part of their story.
[1:07:41] And when they got done, they realized
[1:07:43] the question that that asked is, "What
[1:07:46] step will you take next?
[1:07:49] What step will you take next? And have
[1:07:52] you forgotten God in your in your
[1:07:54] preparation taking yourself? Have you
[1:07:57] forgotten him? It that's the question
[1:07:59] that I asked this morning because God
[1:08:01] has all of us. God has something that he
[1:08:04] want all of us to do. God has a path
[1:08:07] that he want all of us to take. And each
[1:08:09] one of us, our path looks different.
[1:08:12] Amen. But the end goal is how do you
[1:08:14] want your story to end?
[1:08:17] How do you how do you want your story to
[1:08:19] wrap up? How do how do you see the end
[1:08:21] of your
[1:08:23] story? Because you might not know the
[1:08:26] end, but you you can shoot for a goal.
[1:08:28] If the goal is heaven, then there's
[1:08:30] certain things you got to do to get
[1:08:31] there. If the goal is heaven, there's
[1:08:34] certain things that God requires of us
[1:08:36] that he gives us the opportunity to do
[1:08:38] each and every day. Amen.
[1:08:42] Said, "What would you like your steps to
[1:08:44] look like?"
[1:08:47] Amen. At this time,
[1:08:51] um, we just bow our
[1:08:59] heads. Lord, we thank you for this day.
[1:09:02] Lord, we thank you for your presence in
[1:09:04] this place. Lord, we ask that you, Lord,
[1:09:07] we come and we said, Lord, we asked the
[1:09:11] question, Lord, what step would you have
[1:09:12] us to take? Lord, we ask the question,
[1:09:15] what step would you have have me to
[1:09:18] take?
[1:09:18] Lord, if you ask yourself the question,
[1:09:21] what step would you would you have me to
[1:09:23] take, Lord? And Lord, I want to make
[1:09:26] sure that when I take this step, I put
[1:09:28] you in this step. Is there anyone this
[1:09:31] morning that says, Lord, I have heard
[1:09:33] your word, and today I want to take the
[1:09:37] step that I want to give my life to you.
[1:09:39] Is there anyone today has heads bowed
[1:09:41] and eyes closed that raise your hand and
[1:09:43] say, "Lord, I want to give my life to
[1:09:46] you, Lord, I I want to take that step to
[1:09:49] giving you complete control over my
[1:09:52] life." Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
[1:09:55] this morning, Lord. You see the hands
[1:09:58] that are lifted and the hearts that are
[1:10:00] open. Lord, I ask that you would come
[1:10:02] down this morning and do something,
[1:10:03] Lord. Change the hearts and change the
[1:10:06] minds, Lord. Lord, as they take this
[1:10:08] next step in you, Lord, may you lead and
[1:10:10] guide them, Lord. May you direct them in
[1:10:13] a path, Lord. And and Lord, make the
[1:10:15] ways plain before them, Lord, and make
[1:10:17] the way straight, Lord. We thank you
[1:10:20] this morning for doing it. Lord, we ask
[1:10:22] that you continue to move in this place,
[1:10:25] Lord, as we as we go into the next part.
[1:10:27] Lord, we ask that you watch over us and
[1:10:30] protect us. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:10:33] Amen. as we turn the service over to
[1:10:36] brother Simmons will lead us in a song.
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:55] Amen. Lead me.
[1:10:59] guide
[1:11:01] me
[1:11:05] along the way.
[1:11:11] Oh, if you leave me
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:45] Oh, heat,
[1:11:54] heat. Heat.
[1:12:09] Heat. Heat.
