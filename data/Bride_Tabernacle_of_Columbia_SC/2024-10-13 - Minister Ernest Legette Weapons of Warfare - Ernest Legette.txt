this morning at the book of second Corinthians by the grace of God y'all feel all right this morning second Corinthians 10 amen 10 and we'll begin here at the at the first verse you got it say amen amen and it reads now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and the gentleness of Christ who in the presence and base among you but being absent am bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present when the confid with that confidence where with I think to be bold hold against some which think of us as if we walk according to the flesh amen how many know we're not walking according to the flesh this morning says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they are what Mighty amen how many thank God for that this morning we got Mighty weapons amen they're Mighty through God to the pulling down of what stronghold casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled may God had the bless to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning by the grace of God today we want to talk to you on the weapons of warfare amen we just speak here for a minute and I like here you know in the scriptures how we reading you know we got we're not first thing I say is we got to understand that and a lot of times I think people get mistak is when they come to God you know they get saved they think it's going to be a cake walk like they say or skip or a hop to the heaven but that's not the truth amen it's going to be some battles to fight right it's going to be some hills to climb y'all believe that this morning it's going to be some struggles it's going to be some all light all out sometimes hand to hand combat ain't it with the Enemy but it's one thing about it in the fight that we're fighting that we already overcome right says that we've overcome already we fighting this fight but we already know what the end of it is right I used to have this little this little saying uh somebody with talking to me one time and they were saying you know we just going to have this little saying that I win amen that's right no matter what the situation is I win right no matter what contest what battle in the end of the story is I win amen I might be losing right now but I win amen say how you won because God has already won for me right come on I ain't fighting this fight on my own sometimes we got to remember the fight we figh and we ain't fighting on our own hallelujah our job is to keep praising God no matter what Hallelujah y'all believe that this morning come on things change when you learn how to praise God Through Your Storm right come on when you learn how to fight how are we fighting this morning cuz remember the weapons of our Warfare are not Conor we ain't fighting no flesh and blood blood battles right sometime people think that people coming against you people saying this today come on we ain't fighting Flesh and Blood these spiritual battles that we fighting and how are we going to fight these spiritual battles we going to fight them with weapons that's not carnal right come on but the the weapons we got they're Mighty Hallelujah through God in the pulling down the strongholds and every I like how it says every H thing High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God come on anything that exalt itself against what the word of God said Is A Lie this morning y'all believe it come on let every man be a lie let God word be true y'all believe that this morning come on somebody praise God this morning but I said what it is come on the weapons of our Warfare come on this isn't a a a cake while we in right it's a battle right it's a battle that we fighting praise the Lord come on but God has giv us giv Us weapons you know I was thinking about how how a lot of times throughout all the ages you know the the the different weapons they advaned right things have changed they might have started out using sticks and stones at one time right but then next thing you know they learned how to make iron so people got swords and Spears now right so the Sticks and Stones ain't going to be able to fight against the the the the swords and the spears right then they came out with the with the bow and arrows didn't they then they say you know the B and arrows they can only shoot so far now somebody got the crossbow right then they come from the crossbow then the Chinese I think it was they invented the gunpowder right but whoever had the best weapons they was the ones who most of the time overcame and conquered everybody else right come on but I don't know no other weapon better than the word of God this morning come on now it's one thing about all these natural weapons they had to advance and keep advancing but God gave us one weapon from the beginning of time Hallelujah and and it's it's enough Hallelujah that when everything else is changing he said I'm the Lord and I change not hallelujah what God did in the beginning was right it worked in and it's working now how many believe that this morning Hallelujah God don't have to change with time ain't it come on he's good all the time ain't he come on but I thought about as the as the age in in the in the in the wars and the things the the the the the weapons advancing right I said they they went to the single shot rifles right then they went to the automatics right then they start somebody made grenades start throwing grenades so whoever had the best weapons was going to win ain't it then they came out with the airplanes and the bombs right now they not advance to Atomic weapons come on now they dropped they got they got uh I think Russia created a bomb they call it Satan Satan too they said they dropped this thing over over in the in in the state of Texas Wipe Out the whole state with one one bomb and they named it Satan Hallelujah come on but ain't nobody better than God this morning come on ain't ain't no no no atomic bomb or nothing can't wipe God out Hallelujah the Bible says that heaven and earth will pass away but the word of God hallelujah that's what's going to remain forever right so that's what I said you got to get the word in you Hallelujah you got to let the Holy Ghost come in come on because when the word is there come on they might destroy this flesh but the soul hallelujah oh Jesus come on I believe that this morning come on we fighting we in a battle y'all in a battle this morning come on but we we singing the whole way through this battle Hallelujah we Victorious the whole way through this fight Hallelujah come on the thing about it I say you know I know how to get all over myself but I say what it is you know once once something it's something about the word of God the word of God has the ability and I try to tell that with people all the time they call you and they got all kind of problems and I said the thing about it is you can tell me all your problems right you can dump it all on me sometime have you feeling a little down too cuz they dumped all but I I said I know one person that you can go to with all of your problems Hallelujah and not only will they listen but they can get you up out of where you at Hallelujah no matter how low you falling or where you got I know one one person I know one that can go down and get you Hallelujah I like that song says if he have to reach lay down Jesus will pick you up sometimes I think about that song about the blood that that never lost his power and how it flows to the highest of mountains down to the lowest of valleys I can see myself I remember praying back then in the Motel 6 thinking about how low I was thinking about how everybody looked like they done cast you away Hallelujah but when I begin crying out to God I said God if you hear me Hallelujah I feel like Jacob he said I ain't worthy of the least of your mercies but God if you hear me if you give me a chance God I serve you I give you all I got hallelujah oh Jesus and I can see that blood reaching down to the lest of valleys people don't cast you away looked at you and said all kind of things but that blood reached down to the L of valys and begin to encourage you to say I know my thoughts concerning you Hallelujah and they're good and not evil everybody cast you away everybody talking about you but I know how how I think about you hallelujah oh Jesus come on I know how I feel about you that's encouraging when God talk to you like that come on when God is on your side Hallelujah I feel like if God is for you then who can be against you this morning come on now come on we fighting I said you know people's talking say I say you know what they ain't them that's the devil they ain't calling them the devil but we fighting spiritual battles ain't we somebody said I don't know why I said I don't know why they said that that was a spirit wasn't it we fighting we fighting spiritual battles right how you going to lose when you think you fighting fleshly battles when you respond the wrong way but when you respond the right way come on you winning the devil confused ain't he come on now come on nobody can't curse what God bless when God bless you nobody can't curse oh Jesus Hallelujah I was sharing with them I said that that the other day you know we got new management at the jail and they had to have a one-on-one with you they said well cuz they had somebody had already had to tell them about you they said well they said that you don't want to be here you got a bad attitude you can't work with nobody you just angry all the time I said Lord knows I said why did I said I know exactly who told you that so when I called the name they started laughing they said yeah said I said I don't know why they said that right but it just so happened something had messed up and it was two shifts they couldn't get it right and the Lord just coming you know I always says Lord cuz it is the Lord the Lord the Lord Make Room for you the devil try to block don't you worry about people trying to block you out God going to make room for you all you just keep serving God that's all it is come on nobody can't when God bless you everybody trying to the devil trying to block it come on God blessed Israel and baac and all them was trying their best to curse them couldn't could they come on God use your enemies to do what bless you come on now I don't even call them my enemies cuz I say nothing but Spirits Anyway come on all I'm doing is praising God all I'm doing is testifying about the goodness of God and the devil is mad with you but it can't stop come on cuz that's my whole life that's why I live that's my whole testimony you know if it wasen for God I wouldn't be here this morning come on me and brother Damien was talking yesterday some testimonies if it wasn't for God wouldn't be here today how can I brag on how can I talk about anything else but him and how good he been to me when I open my mouth in the morning how can I not praise God how can I not say thank you how can I not tell God how much I love him cuz it could have been the other way Hallelujah I don't know why Jesus love me I don't know why he cares but I'm glad he did Hallelujah I don't know why chose me but I'm glad he did and I'm going show him that I'm glad he did Hallelujah I'm going take advantage of every opportunity he give me to praise God I ain't going to leave no time left to say I wish I would have did that come on I'm every moment I got I'm going give God praise tell him how good he is come onall I said the devil been throwing some Haymakers you know what a hate maker is usually they say the they they save the pay maker for the last punch to knock you out well I said lately I done been through quite a few of them and I'm still standing Hallelujah I ain't knocked out yet Hallelujah I might have been knocked down but God picked me back up Hallelujah put me back in the fight oh Jesus oh God cuz when I'm weak I found out long time ago that God is strong Hallelujah y found out when it's raining real hard Hallelujah that's when God shows up oh Jesus an extra anointing comes don't it come on oh Jesus but I remember the other day I was telling my wife them I says you know after that whole little meeting I had they said Ernest we put you in for a $3 raise they said we hope this will change your attitude about the job I said it's working in my favor come on I said it's working in my favor right you know the scripture that came to my mind no weapon formed against you come on no weapon y'all believe that this morning come on now no weapon formed against you shall prosper right come on Amen you ain't got that that's the thing about it the weapons of our Warfare ain't carnal right but that Mighty Jesus showed us how to fight on the mountain didn't he every time the devil came to him what he say it's written Hallelujah he ain't had to do nothing he said it's written come on didn't he and it defeated the enemy he a have to do nothing but it's written come on the word of God got power in it's written I ain't got to be frustrated and word and all that come on it's written no weapon formed against me shall prosper it's written hallelujah oh Jesus I never seen the righteous forsaken nor SE bag and brand come on that's written a't it come on I thought about when sickness attacking your body Hallelujah come on he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes it's written Hallelujah weapons of our Warfare ain't carnal come on I said I was going to be short this morning I get stirred all right all right sh had ask me say where your notebook at I said if I have it I might go hour and something God is good ain't he come on now remember the weapons of our Warf Frank carel I never always the lord always showed me one thing and always in in when my trials I didn't know what to do or I was confused I always got under my knees cuz you got to learn how to pray prayer like brother Ed was saying will fix it every time you got to learn how to pray when you don't know how to pray then you you you go through things real harder than you should have went through but when you learn how to pray what it is God change your whole out viw look on stuff when you learn how to pray God give you a whole out look you look at the whole thing a little different now and 99% of the times God always came with a scripture I heard it scripture so many times but this time when I'm going through God just feed a scripture in there come on and the Holy Ghost just anoints it and it becomes alive and then you come out a different person situation might seem like it's the same but I'm different now come on I can go on and praise God cuz he not took care of Hallelujah and that's the truth God does it every time amen [Music] [Applause] praise God Amen if you don't have your weapon then you can get your weapon am by repenting of your sins being baptized in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and the promise is that God would give you you what it takes to defeat every devil and every demon and that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen then you need it yes sir and God is willing to give it to you amen so by the grace of God you heard the word this morning amen I'm not going to prolong the time but it's good to be here amen thank God for all of you that made it here this morning amen it's a encouragement to our hearts Amen to see so many of you amen but if you want God to amen fix it for you you want God to move in your life you got to be willing to yield yourself and trust God enough that I know he can do it for me I know God can help me if nobody else can God can do it he'll do it for you you ought to allow him to do it for you for Jesus wants to help amen as our brothers sing if you here this morning and you want God to
