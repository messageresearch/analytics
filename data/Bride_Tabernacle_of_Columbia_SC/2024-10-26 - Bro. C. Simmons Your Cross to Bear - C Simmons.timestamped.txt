[30:59] let us
[31:01] bow Lord Jesus we thank you for allowing
[31:04] us to be in in your house one more time
[31:07] and Lord just thank you for allowing us
[31:09] and showing us that we can depend Lord
[31:12] no matter what may come our way Lord we
[31:14] can depend on you to be there for us and
[31:17] to see us through and Lord we ask that
[31:19] you send your anointing send your
[31:21] presence Lord move us out of the way
[31:23] Lord that you may get all the glory and
[31:25] all the honor and all the praise and in
[31:28] Jesus name we pray amen
[31:30] amen amen if you have your Bibles
[31:37] tonight I think I said
[31:47] Matthew Matthew chapter 16
[31:58] I think we start reading in verse
[32:10] 24 when you got it say amen
[32:17] amen then Jesus said unto his disciples
[32:21] If any man will come after me let him
[32:23] deny himself and take up his cross and
[32:27] follow me
[32:29] for whosoever will save his life shall
[32:32] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[32:35] for my sake shall find it for what is a
[32:38] man profited if he should gain the whole
[32:41] world and lose his own soul or what
[32:44] shall a man give in exchange for his for
[32:47] his soul may God bless the reading of
[32:49] this word you may be
[32:52] seated amen I like to speak I entitled
[32:55] this
[32:56] topic um something tonight I said your
[32:59] cross to bear your cross to bear and I
[33:03] started thinking about it and I started
[33:06] thinking about the cross and and how how
[33:09] Jesus said here
[33:11] that that if let If any man come unto me
[33:14] let him deny himself and take up his
[33:16] cross and follow me which means
[33:19] sometimes that there's going to be a
[33:20] cross for you and I to bear it's going
[33:22] to be something that we going to have to
[33:24] go through and we going to have to bear
[33:25] it and I started thinking about that I
[33:28] said sometimes we get so focused on our
[33:30] cross that we don't look at the one that
[33:32] saved us we don't look at the the God's
[33:35] provided we cuz we're so busy looking at
[33:38] our cross we're looking we looking at
[33:40] how heavy it is and sometimes your cross
[33:43] can get heavy sometimes your cross can
[33:46] be something that seems unbearable to
[33:48] you and I and we'll turn into scripture
[33:51] here cuz cuz if you think that you are
[33:53] alone I wanted to show you that you're
[33:55] not alone let's turn to First Kings
[33:57] chapter
[34:00] 19 and you see that this this this thing
[34:03] in life was so effective that it didn't
[34:05] just touch the regular people it touched
[34:09] even God's prophets it touched the God's
[34:11] anointed ones and and someone and
[34:14] special people as well in verse in the
[34:17] second verse it says um this is after
[34:21] Elijah had went and had the mount Karma
[34:23] sh down if you read your Bible you'll
[34:24] know if you don't read chapter 18 but
[34:27] where God had come down and sent his
[34:29] fire down and destroyed the sacrifice on
[34:32] the Altar and he had proved to his
[34:34] people that he was God and that he was
[34:37] still there and in verse 19 what
[34:39] happened uh chapter 19 we'll start at
[34:42] the first verse and he said and Ahab
[34:44] told Jezebel all that Elijah had done
[34:46] and with all how he had slain all the
[34:49] prophets with the sword then Jezebel
[34:52] sent a messenger un Elijah saying so let
[34:54] the gods do to me and more so and more
[34:57] also if I make not thy life as the life
[35:00] of one of them by tomorrow about this
[35:03] time see Jezebel wanted to kill Elijah
[35:06] cuz that's what happened to her prophets
[35:08] well in verse three it said and when he
[35:10] saw that he arose and went for his life
[35:13] and came to BBA which belonged to Judah
[35:16] and left his servants there but he
[35:18] himself went a day Journey Into the
[35:20] Wilderness and came and sat down under a
[35:23] juniper tree P per tree and watch this
[35:26] and he said and he requested for himself
[35:30] that he might die go ahead just imagine
[35:33] how heavy his cross was that he said God
[35:37] I want to
[35:39] die and I started thinking about it I
[35:41] said the devil can make your cross seem
[35:43] so heavy that you'll be like Elijah and
[35:46] say Lord I want to
[35:47] die but God wasn't finished with Elijah
[35:51] God had a work that Elijah still had to
[35:53] do in his life that and see it wasn't in
[35:56] Elijah control but that didn't mean that
[35:58] Elijah didn't come to him and said Lord
[36:00] I want to
[36:01] die see his cross got heavy he got heavy
[36:05] but if you read on and it said it is
[36:08] enough now Lord take away my life for
[36:11] I'm not better than my fathers see
[36:13] Elijah was looking at and say I I can't
[36:16] I can't overcome this test I'm no better
[36:19] than the people that were before me so
[36:21] if they was if they weren't strong then
[36:23] how strong am
[36:25] I if they weren't if they if they failed
[36:27] and how what about me I'm no stronger
[36:30] than them Elijah looked at them and I
[36:32] said sometimes you get into a place the
[36:35] one thing you can't do is compare your
[36:36] cross to somebody else's I said you can
[36:39] look this one and that but you can't
[36:41] compare your cross to somebody else is
[36:44] because what looks heavy to them might
[36:46] not be heavy to you and what looks what
[36:48] is heavy to you might not be heavy to
[36:50] them so you can't look at them and say
[36:52] our crosses are the same goe they have a
[36:55] cross cuz each one of us has a cross
[36:58] but that but you can't look at them and
[37:00] compare and say our crosses are the same
[37:02] cuz God gave you your your cross for you
[37:05] and he gave them their cross for them
[37:07] and sometimes you looking at them and
[37:09] say they cross is easy but God knew what
[37:12] they could take God knew what they could
[37:14] bear he knew what they could bear and
[37:16] that's why he gave your cross to you and
[37:18] their cross to
[37:20] them he he did that for a reason because
[37:23] he knew what would shape and mold you he
[37:26] knew what would make you into what what
[37:27] he wanted you to be he knew that this
[37:29] test and trial you you would overcome
[37:32] and survive from but he knew if he gave
[37:34] it to somebody else they would die
[37:36] immediately it wasn't something that
[37:39] would take long for them to die and you
[37:41] look at them and said sometimes all
[37:43] crosses are not seen many of the crosses
[37:46] that you may bear it it is nobody ever
[37:49] sees them it's something that's behind
[37:52] door but it doesn't mean that you don't
[37:54] have a cross so someone looking at you
[37:56] and say your life is easy easy I don't
[37:59] see what anything that you go
[38:01] through because they're trying to
[38:03] compare their cross to yours or you're
[38:06] trying to compare your cross to them and
[38:08] all you see is things that are going on
[38:10] and all you see is God blessing them but
[38:13] you don't see the cross but that doesn't
[38:15] mean the cross ain't there that doesn't
[38:18] mean that that someone ain't going
[38:19] through their cross and they carrying
[38:21] that cross and and they're going through
[38:24] life with that cross on them but God
[38:26] said I never put more on you then you
[38:27] can bear that's what he said so when you
[38:30] looking at you sometimes you done looked
[38:32] at the cross and ain't looked that God
[38:34] and provided way amen you ain't looked
[38:36] at God and said I'll never leave you nor
[38:38] forsake you so if he gave you the cross
[38:40] he got a way for you to go through it he
[38:43] got a way for you to carry that cross
[38:44] he'll give you strength that you may
[38:46] make it with that cross he said I'll
[38:49] give you the cross but if you don't take
[38:51] the cross you won't get a crown amen if
[38:53] you don't take the cross you won't get a
[38:55] crown and sometimes you get ready to say
[38:57] I'm ready to cast the cross
[38:59] off I'm done carrying this cross I'm
[39:03] done carrying this thing I'm done
[39:05] dealing with this but you ain't really
[39:07] overcome it
[39:09] yet but if you ain't overcome it God has
[39:12] send you right back there for you to
[39:13] pick it back up so that you can come
[39:15] through it and when you come through it
[39:17] then he said hey but guess what when you
[39:19] come through that one there's another
[39:21] one there's another one but it's going
[39:23] to be different but there's another one
[39:25] that don't make it any easier it just
[39:27] proves that God he said he's not s
[39:29] yesterday today and forever so if he can
[39:32] bring you through this one he can take
[39:33] you through the next
[39:35] one and said and I want to finish
[39:38] reading here he said and he and Elijah
[39:41] as verse 5 and he said as he laid down
[39:43] lay and slept under a juniper tree
[39:46] behold then an angel touched him and
[39:48] said unto him arise and eat see God
[39:51] didn't leave Elijah alone he got to the
[39:54] point that God heard him he said I'm not
[39:56] going to leave your on I got to come and
[39:58] I got to give you something to take you
[40:00] through this cross I got to give you
[40:02] something that's going to sustain you
[40:04] from the cross and in verse six he said
[40:06] and he looked and behold there was a
[40:08] cake bacon on the co and a cruise of
[40:12] water at his head and he did eat and
[40:14] drink and laid down again and the angel
[40:16] of the Lord came again this the second
[40:19] time and touched him and said arise and
[40:21] eat because the journey is too great for
[40:23] thee and he arose and did eat and drink
[40:26] and went in the strength of that meat 40
[40:28] days and 40 nights unto wh the Mount of
[40:31] God see God gave him something because
[40:33] he knew the journey was coming he knew
[40:36] how heavy the journey was but when God
[40:38] gives you something to Feast on it'll
[40:40] carry you through amen and all you have
[40:42] to do is believe on one word amen it it
[40:46] you don't have to sometime you say I
[40:47] need to know what's in the whole Bible
[40:49] but I heard someone said I said you can
[40:52] they said the word have I hid in my
[40:54] heart that I might not sin against thee
[40:55] but if you ain't got no words in there
[40:58] am then then then you can't you can't
[41:01] dwell on nothing to carry you through
[41:03] you can't lean on nothing and look back
[41:05] and and know where God what what God has
[41:08] said so you got to have something in you
[41:10] so I can lean back and say Lord you said
[41:13] in your word and I believe it and that's
[41:16] it and see when you got something that
[41:19] that's why he says study to show thyself
[41:20] approved you got to study you got to
[41:22] take time with God and read his word and
[41:25] so that you can have something to lean
[41:27] on when the Devil comes to attack you
[41:29] when the Devil Comes cuz he going to
[41:31] come if you live long enough he going to
[41:33] come and and when you when you live long
[41:36] enough you'll have something to say Lord
[41:38] I know that you did it and I know what
[41:41] you done and even though I Stumble I
[41:43] can't fall because you got me even
[41:45] though I Stumble I know that Lord you're
[41:47] right here to keep me with this cross
[41:50] this cross that I'm bearing see I
[41:52] thought and I read in the scripture when
[41:53] you go down and you see Jesus you'll see
[41:55] that Jesus didn't carry his
[41:58] cross they called Simon out of the crowd
[42:01] to carry the cross see Jesus KN God knew
[42:04] how much Jesus could bear and he knew
[42:07] that Jesus had to die on the cross he
[42:10] couldn't die before he got to the
[42:12] Cross he couldn't die before he got on
[42:15] that hill and shed his blood so he had
[42:18] to get God allowed someone to come out
[42:20] and say you will carry this cross and
[42:23] see sometimes God just waiting on you to
[42:25] to stop looking at the cross and said
[42:27] lord I can't handle it amen lord I can't
[42:30] deal with this no more but I know that
[42:32] you can I know either whether you take
[42:35] the cross off of me or you give me the
[42:37] strength to Bear the cross I know that
[42:39] you can do something for me that I can't
[42:41] do for myself I know that you can I can
[42:44] lean on you and depend on you to do
[42:46] something for me that I can't do for
[42:48] myself amen see that's what he wants you
[42:51] to do get to that point and sometimes he
[42:53] allowed the CR the cross to intensify
[42:55] and get heavier and you to get weaker so
[42:58] that you realize that you can't do it
[43:00] yourself and when you realize that
[43:02] you'll start looking up you'll start
[43:05] look to the heels from which cometh your
[43:07] help see see what that's what God
[43:11] sometimes got to get you to the point of
[43:13] he's got to get you to the point that
[43:15] you're not looking at it that I can do
[43:17] it that I'm strong enough that I'm I I I
[43:21] if I go and do this I'll be able to do
[43:23] what I need to do and I'll be strong
[43:25] enough to carry this cross amen that's
[43:28] why he gives you the cross cuz he knows
[43:30] that God wants you to realize that he's
[43:32] a provider that he's a savior he's a
[43:35] deliverer but he's a keeper and as you
[43:38] said if you want to be
[43:41] kept but you got to come to the Lord
[43:44] sometimes and say Lord keep me say Lord
[43:47] I want to be kept you got to make a
[43:49] positive declaration to the Lord get
[43:51] down on your knees and say Lord I want
[43:53] to be kept Lord I want I know what you
[43:56] done for me and Lord I want to be kept
[43:58] Lord I know what the things that you've
[44:00] done I don't want to go back to where I
[44:02] was cuz you never go back to where you
[44:04] was you go back further than where you
[44:06] was am you never return to the spot that
[44:09] where you was most time you go back
[44:11] worse amen so you got to come to God and
[44:13] say Lord I want to be kept Lord I lift
[44:16] my hands and say Lord I want to be kept
[44:19] see God wants to hear you say it Lord I
[44:21] know what you done but don't stop there
[44:24] amen Lord I I know what you done and and
[44:27] the devil is coming to attack me now cuz
[44:29] now I got a cross to bear the devil will
[44:32] make it seem like when you doing what
[44:34] you want to do that you ain't got no
[44:36] cross at all cuz he make it easy well
[44:39] actually he don't make it easy cuz you
[44:40] got to work to get to
[44:42] hell you got to do a whole lot of stuff
[44:45] to get to Hell amen and so it's not an
[44:47] easy road to get there he just make it
[44:50] seem like it is cuz you get to the point
[44:52] that you just say I don't
[44:55] care that's a dangerous place to be
[44:59] that's a dangerous place to be and if
[45:01] you on that precipice where you you just
[45:04] trying to decide what you want to
[45:07] do sometimes you got to wake up and say
[45:09] I actually do care amen you got to wake
[45:12] up and say I actually care where I spend
[45:14] my eternal
[45:16] destination see it's not about whe what
[45:18] I do today and tomorrow it's whether
[45:20] what you doing while you're running this
[45:22] race cuz when you get there God just
[45:24] going to ask you what did you do with
[45:26] the life I gave you amen come on what
[45:29] did you do uhhuh see just because just
[45:32] because you think it's it's so easy to
[45:35] do this yes when you come to God there
[45:37] are things that the devil is going to
[45:39] try to do but God will be right there
[45:41] with you to carry you through it that's
[45:44] the whole point of going to him I want
[45:46] to read something he said Prophet God
[45:50] said the church needs tonight not a soft
[45:52] hybrid thing or soft or flabby like the
[45:54] church is just make a conf be baptized
[45:58] and you're a Christian to be a Christian
[46:01] is
[46:02] self-denial deny yourself and take up
[46:04] your cross follow me daily today is so
[46:08] soften that people call themselves
[46:10] Christians when it used to mean death to
[46:13] confess Christ you had to depend on him
[46:16] daily for everything you had need of and
[46:20] I think we get to a point in in the
[46:22] world and how the world is going that
[46:24] eventually you going to have to depend
[46:26] on God daily amen God has been gracious
[46:29] and merciful to allow us to do things
[46:32] and to do things and you think that I'm
[46:33] doing this on my own but it's only
[46:36] because of the grace of God and you
[46:38] can't forget that that lord it's your
[46:40] grace and mercy that I'm able to go
[46:42] places and do the things with freedom
[46:45] amen because there are places in the
[46:47] world that they don't have that freedom
[46:50] they don't have that freedom where they
[46:51] can just do what they want to do where
[46:54] they can go to church and it be a great
[46:56] thing and easy thing there are places
[46:58] where they have to be in secrecy amen
[47:01] will it come a point in time for for us
[47:03] to be like that we don't know that's why
[47:05] take advantage of what God has given you
[47:07] right now each and every time you come
[47:10] to the house of the Lord take advantage
[47:12] of it
[47:13] amen he said that same God lives today I
[47:17] know that's true and he's just a great
[47:20] he's just as great today as he was then
[47:23] if he ever was God he still is God if he
[47:27] ever was God he still is God but if he
[47:30] isn't God then he never was
[47:33] God because he's a god of of the whole
[47:37] because he's a god of the whole human
[47:40] race so what good what good does it do
[47:43] to talk about a god of Abraham if he
[47:46] isn't the same God
[47:48] today what would it do to talk about a
[47:51] God who could open up the Red Sea if he
[47:54] couldn't for his children to escape if
[47:57] he couldn't do the same thing today what
[47:59] about a God that could raise a dead man
[48:02] out of the Grave if he can't do the same
[48:05] thing
[48:05] today so what is God if he's not the
[48:08] same today as he was yesterday what is
[48:12] that God and say what good does it do to
[48:15] give your canary bird fine seeds and
[48:17] vitamins to grow good to grow good
[48:20] strong bones and wings and Feathers then
[48:22] keep him in a cage how is it how is it
[48:25] going to use them
[48:27] what good does it do to teach a Bible of
[48:30] some great
[48:32] God said what good does it do for you
[48:35] for for you to to say all these things
[48:38] of what God is and God doesn't do them
[48:42] that's no better than anybody else's but
[48:45] it has to come to a point that you
[48:47] realize that God wants to do what he
[48:49] said he would do and God has to show
[48:52] that I am God that I am God and I change
[48:56] not that I am God and I change not so if
[48:59] I said I would do it I have to do it
[49:01] because then I wouldn't be
[49:04] God I wouldn't be God and
[49:12] said he said looking unto Jesus the
[49:14] author and finisher of our faith who for
[49:17] the joy that was set before him endured
[49:19] the cross despising the shame and then
[49:22] sat down at the right hand of the Throne
[49:24] of God see God endured the cross and ask
[49:27] the question what are you
[49:29] enduring what are you enduring on your
[49:31] journey what are you what are you en
[49:33] enduring on this journey that God has
[49:36] given you see without your cross you
[49:38] won't get a crown amen Jesus even had to
[49:41] go to the cross and and see he showed us
[49:44] he was the ultimate example of what he
[49:47] took he was the ultimate example of what
[49:50] he took but he said I'm going here so
[49:52] that you don't have to I'm going here
[49:54] that all you have to do is come to me
[49:56] repent of your sin be baptized and and
[50:00] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[50:02] and live a clean life as I as I ask you
[50:04] to and live for me and then you can make
[50:06] it in it wasn't a whole lot of things
[50:09] that he asked us to do but he wanted us
[50:11] to come and said said Lord the cross
[50:13] that you give me I want to take it all
[50:16] the way Lord whatever cross you give me
[50:19] I want to carry this cross because you
[50:21] gave it to me that I may make it in I
[50:23] take this cross because you died on the
[50:25] cross I take this cross because this
[50:28] cross is building me so that I can get
[50:30] my crown one day you don't look you
[50:33] looking at your cross but you're not
[50:34] looking at the Finish Line you're
[50:36] looking at the you looking at the the
[50:38] journey but you're not looking at the
[50:40] finish line and when you start looking
[50:42] at the Finish Line you realize a lot of
[50:44] things in your life won't mean a lot as
[50:47] much as they do when you're looking at
[50:49] the finish line and where you so the
[50:51] question is where do you want to go the
[50:54] question is where do you want to end up
[50:56] the question is what do you where do you
[50:58] see your life when you see the end when
[51:02] you cuz you sometimes you might not
[51:03] think of where the end of my journey may
[51:07] lead you might just be going through
[51:09] each and every day and say I got a long
[51:11] time but that ain't promised to you
[51:13] tomorrow tomorrow ain't promised you to
[51:15] you but if if it was the end today where
[51:18] would you be amen and so when you start
[51:21] thinking of that you start looking at
[51:23] the cross that I'm carrying you start
[51:25] looking at where I am you start looking
[51:27] at what's happening to me and what's
[51:29] wrong with me and what's going on with
[51:30] me and all this started thing and you
[51:32] started looking at what's the real
[51:34] purpose of life what's the real purpose
[51:37] of what I'm doing what what is I'm doing
[51:40] that's going to lead me to where I want
[51:41] to be and you have to make that decision
[51:44] for yourself I can't make that decision
[51:47] for you I can't lead you and say and as
[51:50] much as anybody can tell you one day you
[51:52] have to make the decision for yourself
[51:55] and when you make that de decision
[51:57] whatever decision you make is is going
[51:59] to have an impact on the rest of your
[52:01] life it's going to have an impact on
[52:03] what you do each and every day whether
[52:05] you go here and you take this or whether
[52:07] you go with your friend some days or
[52:09] whether you come and say you know what
[52:11] I'm going to church tonight and it's not
[52:13] because it's not because somebody making
[52:15] you it's because now you want to cuz you
[52:18] made a decision that Lord the cross is
[52:20] not not important I just want to make
[52:23] sure where I'm going I is where you want
[52:26] me to go
[52:27] Lord what I'm doing is what you want me
[52:28] to do you'll give me strength to Bear
[52:30] the cross you will give me the strength
[52:33] that I won't have to look at the cross I
[52:35] can look and say Lord I know that you're
[52:37] going to take this cross and you're
[52:38] going to provide a way that I can go
[52:40] through this cross I can carry this
[52:42] cross and I can reach the Finish Line
[52:45] amen and I can go on and Lord you can do
[52:47] the work that you promised that you
[52:49] would do Lord I can believe that Lord
[52:51] you would do what you said you would do
[52:53] so the cross is not something that I'm
[52:55] looking at no more
[52:57] more I'm not wondering how I'm going to
[52:59] make it day to day cuz I know that you
[53:00] got the days I'm not looking at whether
[53:04] you going to heal my body cuz I know
[53:05] that you got that and you said that you
[53:07] would so by your strikes I am healed so
[53:10] I can look at it and keep going I'm not
[53:12] looking at the sickness no more if
[53:14] that's my cross I'm not looking at
[53:16] whether I going to live right no more
[53:18] because if that's my
[53:20] cross because I can look at it and say
[53:22] Lord you'll give me the strength to
[53:24] overcome that you'll give me the
[53:26] strength to overcome whatever I may face
[53:28] each and every day whether it's
[53:30] depression anxiety Lord you will take
[53:32] that away from me amen that I can
[53:35] overcome it that this cross I'm not
[53:38] focused on oh how anxious I am I'm
[53:41] looking at you and say Lord you
[53:42] delivered me amen whether I see it today
[53:44] or see it tomorrow or the next day Lord
[53:46] you delivered me amen and I can confess
[53:49] that Lord you delivered me Lord you
[53:51] delivered me Lord I I'm not going to
[53:53] deal with this amen and see that'll calm
[53:55] you all the way way down you start
[53:57] calling on Jesus and and he come in the
[53:59] room and come on the scene that'll calm
[54:01] you all the way down it'll get you to a
[54:03] place you say you know what eventually
[54:05] the devil say you know ain't no use to
[54:07] me being
[54:08] here cuz every time I come in the room
[54:11] they call on
[54:13] Jesus every time I come to bother them
[54:15] they call on Jesus am and so that he
[54:18] can't be there while God is there light
[54:21] can't shine with Darkness Darkness and
[54:23] Light don't mix together so something
[54:25] has to
[54:26] amen it's whether you want it or not
[54:30] sometimes you have to make the positive
[54:31] confession Lord I want you here Lord I
[54:34] want you in the room with me Lord I want
[54:36] you in my life each and every day Lord I
[54:38] want you every night that I'm awake in
[54:40] the Midnight Hour Lord I want you here
[54:43] amen God want you to confess Lord I want
[54:46] you to be with me Lord I need you to be
[54:49] with me I don't want you I need you to
[54:51] be with me Lord I need you to be the
[54:53] keeper that you said you would be Lord I
[54:55] need you to be the healer that you said
[54:57] you would be Lord I need you to be the
[54:59] deliverer that you said you would be and
[55:01] Lord you said it in your word so I can
[55:03] hold on to it I can believe it that I'm
[55:05] no longer looking at this cross that I'm
[55:07] bearing I'm looking at you I got my eyes
[55:10] solely focused on you and knowing that
[55:12] you will bring me through knowing that
[55:14] you'll Deliver Me Lord I know that what
[55:16] you can do and I'm trusting you to do it
[55:19] I'm trusting you to do it and see that's
[55:22] when you start to open up your mouth and
[55:24] you realize when you start to pray your
[55:25] prayers stretched on your prayers done
[55:29] stretched on because you realize God is
[55:30] doing something you get happy with your
[55:33] prayers you get you start to realizing
[55:35] what God can
[55:37] do I wanted to read something in First
[55:40] Kings 19 and verse n because it was a
[55:44] continuation of the story and I meant to
[55:46] read it
[55:47] earlier and in verse 9 it said and he
[55:49] came thither into a cave Elijah was
[55:52] still out there in the wilderness he
[55:54] came thither un the cave
[55:56] and loded there and behold the word of
[55:58] the Lord came to him and he said unto
[56:00] him what Dost thou hear
[56:03] Elijah and I started thinking about it I
[56:06] said what is God asking you what Dost
[56:08] thou
[56:10] hear in the place that you
[56:13] are God may have something that he wants
[56:15] you to do so he asked the question what
[56:18] does thou hear God had a work for Elijah
[56:21] to do but Elijah had gotten so low he
[56:24] had gotten so low even after God had
[56:26] sustained him and he went through went
[56:28] through the 40 days out in there and he
[56:30] had ate and train God had to come to him
[56:32] and say what does I hear so it's a
[56:35] reminder that sometimes God got
[56:37] something else for you to do he he wants
[56:39] you to he he done show you that you can
[56:41] depend on me you can you can trust me
[56:44] you don't have to look at the cross that
[56:45] you bearing no more and he asked you
[56:48] what does thou hear and I I said God is
[56:51] sometimes he's waiting on us to
[56:54] move he's waiting on us to take up the
[56:57] Baton and you say you know what Lord I'm
[56:59] not going to stay where I am today I'm
[57:02] not going to continue to look at my
[57:04] cross I'm not going to continue to to
[57:07] look at what I'm going through I'm going
[57:09] to go on I'm going to move forward I'm
[57:12] going to take that step and I'm going to
[57:13] trust in you to do what you said you
[57:15] going to do and that's something that
[57:18] it's not until it becomes clear to you
[57:20] that you can actually do it no matter
[57:23] how many some how many times somebody
[57:25] tells you but when it comes real to you
[57:27] for yourself things will
[57:30] happen I I I I can you can trust God and
[57:33] believe that things will happen and
[57:36] there's many testimonies that can tell
[57:38] you that when you latch on the truth
[57:40] faith when you when you get an
[57:42] understanding a revelation all it takes
[57:44] is one thing for you to
[57:46] believe you only got to take God at one
[57:49] word and God to do do things that you
[57:52] never thought that was possible God to
[57:55] do the things in your life that you
[57:56] never thought was possible God to take
[57:59] you and deliver you from things all you
[58:01] have to do is believe that God will do
[58:03] it all you have to do is believe in
[58:06] God's word and he'll do the miraculous
[58:08] he'll deliver you from things and and
[58:10] allow you to overcome things that you
[58:12] never thought of he can give you things
[58:15] and give you insights that you never
[58:17] thought you would have he allow you to
[58:20] if you in school and got a test God
[58:22] allow you and give you the insights on
[58:24] stuff that you didn't understand until
[58:26] you took the
[58:27] test you were studying night in and
[58:30] night out and people could have
[58:31] explained no matter how many and then it
[58:33] come it clicks as soon as you take the
[58:35] test just because you prayed right
[58:38] before you took that test and sometimes
[58:41] I remember in my life I had to pray and
[58:43] said Lord I need this
[58:46] amen and it wasn't necessarily for it
[58:49] was for me I ain't going to tell no one
[58:51] truth but it was because I knew others
[58:53] was praying for me and I said said Lord
[58:56] I I'm they praying almost more than I'm
[58:59] praying that I make it through but I got
[59:02] down I said Lord this is what this is
[59:04] what I need and I need an understanding
[59:07] because it's one thing to take it and
[59:09] and to do it but if you don't get
[59:11] understanding sometimes it doesn't help
[59:13] you it doesn't help you but you got to
[59:15] believe that Lord you the god that can
[59:17] do anything amen amen you're the god
[59:20] that always can show up on the scene for
[59:22] me and sometimes God will show you that
[59:25] I'm still God
[59:26] but you got to come to and ask him Lord
[59:28] I need you to give me understanding Lord
[59:31] I need you to give me wisdom Lord I need
[59:33] you to do it for me I I know you can do
[59:37] it for a lot of but I need you to do it
[59:39] for me so that I can have the testimony
[59:41] of what God has done am so I can have
[59:43] the testimony and tell others how good
[59:46] God is and and realize that I didn't do
[59:49] it myself but it was him that did it for
[59:51] me it was him that did it for me but I'm
[59:53] stepping out on faith and say Lord I'm
[59:55] taking you at your word Lord I'm taking
[59:58] you at your word if you said that you
[1:00:00] would do it for me I believe that you
[1:00:01] would do it for me and Lord and Pastor
[1:00:04] was saying lately he was telling me that
[1:00:06] sometimes you got to tell your testimony
[1:00:08] so others can say hey he did it for such
[1:00:10] and such he can do it for me Lord if you
[1:00:13] gave him the grade that he needed to
[1:00:14] pass the class you can do it for me Lord
[1:00:17] if you gave him the grade that he needed
[1:00:18] to get his scholarship that's what you
[1:00:20] can do it for me yes Lord say you got to
[1:00:23] tell the testimonies of what God has
[1:00:24] done and when he do it don't forget to
[1:00:27] tell God thank you don't forget to come
[1:00:29] back down and say Lord I Thank you for
[1:00:31] what you just did for me and give the
[1:00:34] testimony no matter what it is of what
[1:00:36] God has done amen because it might be
[1:00:39] something small to you but it might be
[1:00:41] great to someone else amen it might be
[1:00:44] something that God has done and you
[1:00:45] think it's so small but God wanted you
[1:00:48] to share it so that someone else could
[1:00:50] believe and continue to have faith in
[1:00:53] what they believe in God for and
[1:00:55] continue to have faith and what they're
[1:00:57] believing God for because maybe in that
[1:00:59] moment in time it's just a little repri
[1:01:02] off of that cross that they're bearing
[1:01:04] it's a little reprieve for them to
[1:01:06] continue to trust God and say Lord I can
[1:01:08] turn my eyes and look to the Hills from
[1:01:11] which cometh my help because I realize
[1:01:14] that it's not me but it's you that's
[1:01:16] going to help me carry this cross and
[1:01:18] when and when I come to the to the end
[1:01:20] of this cross I know it's another one
[1:01:22] but while I'm in this one Lord I need I
[1:01:25] thank you for the encouragement that
[1:01:27] you're giving me to carry this one on I
[1:01:29] thank you for the blessings that you're
[1:01:31] doing and the word that you're speaking
[1:01:32] to me so that I can continue to go on I
[1:01:35] can continue to face this and I can
[1:01:37] continue to Bear the cross that you
[1:01:39] given to me cuz one day I'm going to
[1:01:41] realize that all the crosses was there
[1:01:43] and one day when I I'm not going to look
[1:01:45] at all those crosses if I get a crown am
