have continued with me in my Temptation 29 church I unto you a kingdom as my father appointed unto me that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and set on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel 31 church and the Lord said s Simon behan to have you that he may sh you as we but I prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren 33 and he said unto him Lord the both into prison and death and he said I tell thee Peter the clock shall not Crow this day before that thou shall fce deny that thou knowth me God bless you his word you may [Music] seated in the 32nd verse it says but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren amen amen the book of Jude just before Revelation the book of jeude I want to talk about save but not converted thank youus save but not converted am sometimes folks try to take folks salvation away from them and tell folks they're not saved because they're not with us folks uh Salvation is of the Lord and he saves whomsoever he will but save and not converted what a condition what a situation we have today as it was back then as we read juw here the fifth verse of Jew it says I will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the Lord having what save the people now some folks said God did not save them I'm using the word save amen because the Bible say after he saved them isn't that right people say well this person is not saved because saved but not converted said after saving to save the people out of the land of Egypt he after dest destroy them that what believe not that believe not sometimes we talked on it many times you hear it all the time that we said that God lifts a cup up out of the mud a glass out of the mud right now he lifts it up out of the mud but the it's still muddy and dirty amen amen okay God Lift us up out of our sins and picked us up but you after picking the c glass up he washes it amen so once we're Justified then God comes and he sanctifies us cleans us up some folks have gone through the motion but it's only gone through the motion God Amen done a work for them yes I think they shouted they dance when they got cross the Red Sea and they saw the enemy destroyed amen amen were they saved egyp is a type of sin and God delivered them from their sin are you with me amen God brought them out amen from the Egyptian bondage amen some folks were delivered from all types of drugs and all types of habits and they were delivered amen there was no doubt in there mind these children they danced they shout it they praise the Lord amen cuz God had worked miracles for him amen amen are you with me amen when God save you you got something to shout about amen when you know that you're saved you got something to shout about they were save it was something about it was farther they had more distance to go before they got what God had in store for them for God made promises to you yes amen see after you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin then God says amen he makes promises amen he said this promis to you and to your children and to them that have fall off amen the promise of what the promise that if you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall that's right amen amen receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen sometimes it doesn't mean that you got it he said You shall amen receive it amen but you amen after repenting and being baptized and you don't get it you got to say God you said you share you made a promise to me Lord amen and you keep your promises if you say me then I know you can feel me are you with me I know you can God you can feel me amen amen but sometime folks stop just with being saved and we've been taught sometimes the wrong way because instead of folks uh receiving the uh Holy Ghost they shout because they happy they've been delivered amen amen oh they feel that Joy amen amen they even speak in tongue a little bit amen save but not converted amen oh you would be amen cuz they so happy for what the Lord had done in their life amen save but not converted amen believe we got so many people in church today need to be converted amen let's go back to um Luke here uh and and 22 and let's look at the reaction and response to those that Jesus had uh told them what would happen to them in the future in the Kingdom that they would judg they would be on the set on Thrones and judge the 12 tribes of Israel their position amen and God had identified but he said uh Simon Peter I want to talk to you a little bit I believe we may have some Peters here some Simon Peters here and I believe that God want to talk to you a little bit amen and tell you that Satan has desired to shift you as we amen amen God know he had something in store amen for your life but Satan amen desired to shift you wheat amen sometimes after a person being saved amen they going to be tested and tried amen God just can't give them the promise yet amen many time God won't give it to him right then because there's work to be done amen amen I want to see amen before I give it to you I don't want you amen the trotting under your foot I don't want you a meant to be irresponsible amen amen cuz I got to trust you with us amen some people are irresponsible amen if they had it amen they amen would not use it properly amen amen it has to be a place where amen I'm talking about saved but not converted Peter was able to tell the Lord do I I never deny you he says Satan had desired to sift you at we but I prayed for you I stood in the gap for you praise God somebody stood in the gap for you amen cuz Satan has desired to accept you as we destroy you amen amen but somebody stood in the gap for you am I'm so glad somebody stood in the gap for me amen praise God I'm so glad amen somebody when Satan is there just set me as weel and got saved one day but I wasn't converted went down in jesus' name but I wasn't converted you said well you did yeah I still had problems that needed to be worked out I still had things in my life that needed straighten it out amen needed to be cleaned up amen amen praise God I got that's why I sought the LA I said Lord I need the Holy Ghost amen some folk they receive just a touch a thrill in a jail but they never feel amen some folk realize that and Peter had experienced the power of God Shake somebody hand say God with you but he need to be in you it's all right to have God with you amen but God need to be in you see Peter experienced the joy of having Emmanuel having god with them amen and God been with them amen hold them you go out and y'all cast out Devils go out heal the sick amen amen just with his word they went out amen praise God believe in what he said that they could do it amen praise God there so many people have experienced the word and the word has illuminated their life too many preachers in the pull pit preaching saved but not converted after you converted strengthen your brethren amen amen Peter he said he said 33rd verse he said unto him Lord I'm ready to go with thee both in the prison and death and he said I tell thee you going to deny me twice come on come on man y'all Y y'all stop all Lord I God knows that there's work to be done see you can try to convince yourself and you can try to convince others but amen God knows amen that there's work to be done in your life praise God I want to tell you about this eloquent preacher in uh acts 18 chapter acts 18 and I don't believe a lot of ministers could have uh uh come to that standard that this uh great preacher in the Bible came to and and often times people uh can trust in a a position of authority and yet amen they're not converted that's right praise God man could anoint you to be a a bishop or apstor or this or that that don't mean you're converted amen you may be able to preach like an angel sing like an angel but that don't mean you converted praise God oh I know Peter those must have had oh God hallelujah we've been chosen by the Messiah we we we we cast out Devils we he heal the sick we ra oh Hallelujah perh they raised the dead and all of that had testimony after testimony but yet they hadn't been converted after you converted strengthen your brother so where do I stand in this where am I now because of Peter those uh God sent him out two by two and he said and then he cursed and swear I don't even know the man three times in the marel two or three we didn't let every word be what established three times but Jesus said I pray for you amen amen you going to be all right thank you thank you praise God somebody told him one time that amen the that Jesus amen crucified and died he is risen as he said amen amen somebody ran so fast they saw the closeth where he was amen but yet amen because of unbelief amen Jesus still had to come Amen in their midst and said amen is I he still had to break bread to him on the road to EMES I'm going say God still has to do things for us am to let you know how real he is amen amen and let you know who he is he's still doing things just to vindicate himself just to prove himself amen proving his word every day am God pro oh amen praise God I'm already convinced amen amen that God is oh he he's God Amen I'm already convinced he's my all and all he's everything to me oh yes I'm convinced am amen and I praise him this morning amen hallelujah uh acts 18 and 24 and a certain Jew named AP polos born in Alexander and what kind of man elant man and what Mighty in the

they got the Holy Ghost come on just I got it I I know I would I got it I got it I broken tongue be quiet had the Holy Ghost changed you thank you Jesus If any man be in Christ he's a what he's a new creature old things are what behold All Things become new is it see we not we're not talking about a weak God we're not talking about a weak Holy Ghost for after you converted strengthen your brethren amen we're talking about somebody that amen can strengthen somebody Hallelujah somebody that's willing to go all the way now I done got all my pride out the way sometime you have to go down somewhere

more you got to get rid of something Hallelujah you got your you got a bad Temple boy cutting people ear off and on are you with me amen you got some work to be done on you but after yes after you converted am amen that's why it said humble yourself under the mighty hand of God Amen and he would exalt you in due season ain't that right I'm glad that Peter got an humbling experience amen sometimes it takes uh a good that God would give us humbling experiences amen praise God things that would cause ush Amen to Humble ourselves before the mighty hand of God amen amen God allows certain things to happen in life am to bring us to a point God Amen I don't have what I thought I had Lord I need more than what I had because Lord I look at my failures and I look at myself and say God look what come to shape I'm in and you said that we're more than conquerors and I can't seem to be a conqueror help me Lord because if I'm more than a conqueror then why am I bound amen praise God I said Jesus done Set Me Free and I need to be free indeed he whom the son is set free glory to God amen something ought to happen in your life praise God a change ought to be made when thou converted amen Apollos I'm fervent in the spirit and he SP and taught diligent the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John saved but not converted amen hallelujah the man here here one saved one baptized in Jesus name H pardon me please part me please why you got in order to get saved you get baptized a lot of folk got baptized in Jesus name and ain't saved yet are you with me so a lot of people say I believe the message and ain't saved yet I believe brother Bram is a prophet did that save you oh yeah oh I believe this I believe that did that saved but not converted I ain't nothing wrong with being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ ain't nothing wrong with believe God sent a prop that's all right but I'm talking about when you're saved you have to see the need to be converted also amen amen are you with me amen hallelujah something had to happen to Peter how about Apollos oh well he wasn't fully convinced and he didn't have a full revelation of the message of yah see because all of a sudden amen they was kept under the law shut up amen From Grace are you with me and they knew about Moses Abraham and Isaac and Jacob but they didn't know about Jesus praise God hallelujah but here Peter those day had recognized we found the Messiah amen hallelujah amen they were walking with him talking with him identified with the message of the hour because they had heard that behold I send my messenger before my face and he shall prepare the way of the Lord the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord and they said behold John said Behold the Lamb of God will take away the sins of the world and some of John disciples left John and they went with Jesus are you with me somebody ought to leave John and go with Jesus now amen praise God go with Jesus Hallelujah you ought to leave John and go with Jesus because John pointed you to Jesus and every true servant of God will P you to Jesus I said you ought to go with Jesus cuz he that has the bride is the bridegroom are you with me we ought to go with Jesus Hallelujah but see people they still hanging around John you see what's going on your little kingdom coming down John John said I I'm telling you amen I'm not he I told told y'all but you're trying to convince John and that he is the Messiah that he is the Christ John said I'm not amen amen amen I know who I am I'm theor I'm pointing you to him am but I'm not him so don't worship me worship God Amen are you with me amen amen worship God don't worship me worship God Amen that's what we had in Sunday school this morning worship God so he here it is this man was taught diligently the things of Christ KN only the baptism of John praise God I'm telling you something when lights begin to hit the word you must move amen amen but if there if light begin to shine on the word you must move he said the path of the justice as The Shining Light was shining more and more until the what perfect day are you with me see as the as the light shine walk in the light am amen if you don't walk in the light Darkness going to come oh oh God so he says let me go on and read this and he began to speak boldly in the synagog whom when Aquilla and Priscilla husband and wife heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly amen sometimes we have to take people to the side don't try to embarrass publicly when I first heard people didn't mind embarrassing you or saying anything to you make sure you don't receive it if you want person to receive the word you have to consider amen consider where they are amen not where you are amen that you so Superior and you think you so uh above everybody but consider way they are amen and commend them for where they are and thank God that they you save she said I was on drugs I was down I was in bad shape but God Jesus came into my life amen you in our church you baptized in Jesus name well you ain't Sav you go to you y'all know ain't nobody saved but us we the only one right good is the truth you leave here that's the only truth they ain't talking about the word they talking about everybody claim they got the only way Jesus said I'm the way truth and the life is't that right see that's what the trouble is people want to amen they they want to lay hold on and that we we control the kingdom of God we let in who we let want to let in and let put out who we want to put out all right we got a monoc it's ours okay you don't control God's kingdom you save whom he will amen Jesus okay they the 27th verse it says and when he was disposed to passor Caya the Brethren wrote exalting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through what Grace he he believed through Grace he had a revelation I mean he had more than a lot of folk had he was anointed preacher fervent in the spirit bringing people to see Jesus Christ amen but yet he was missing something amen for he mightily convinced the Jews and publicly showing by the scripture amen come on amen he was showing by what SCP if you going to prove anything prove all all things but prove it by the word amen what my pastor say my church say my Bishop say my Prophet said come on thank you amen but prove it by scripture it's what the scripture said amen well what did he say I what did the scripture said what come on not disrespecting nobody but people are so hung up on this and that and they don't even respect the scripture they respect their Bishop their Pastor they respect this one and that one but they don't respect the scripture and that's what's going on today people don't respect respect the scripture that's why they don't respect one another amen amen true are you with me amen because why they got their own private interpretation and no strip Prophecy of the scriptures of any what private interpretation are you with me amen you got to know that amen if God sends a prophet it's a word Prophet amen are you with me amen he going to keep you in the book amen yes are you with me praise God hallelujah amen can't out to the book and you can't take it away amen praise God when the Seven Seals open it was a seal in the Bible this the

that person be saved they said they just save is you y you ain't saved how you to do something like that and be saved save after he saved people then after he what he destroyed them because they didn't believe isn't that right see somehow they they they believe now they believe enough to acknowledge Jesus as Savior and ask him confess their sin ask him to come into their life he came but he had to go he couldn't stay there praise God he was trying to lead him but they wouldn't let him lead him are you with me amen he took 40 years trying to get their attention but they never it never

couldn't eat that stuff that the croak could amen amen and down in your heart when your heart has actually been converted when you actually been changed when you actually been filled with the Holy Ghost I don't say you might not have a problem you might not go through things but you got to be honest after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall have amen power amen praise God Amen believe Apollos was a good person in 19th Chapter and one it says and it came to pass while polus was that Paul having passed through the upper Coast he came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you what rece the holy GH now now no you ain't believe you you didn't believe he said you believe I acknowledge that you believe amen but have you received the Holy Ghost you might have believed and got baptized you believe but are you converted yet amen are you filled yet have you died out you can't get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the resurrection power so I said you pick the glass up you it's picked up but it's still muddy but you clean it up and sanctify it wash it then you fill it up you're ready to do something then after the Holy Ghost come upon you have power you can be my what Witnesses you can witness then witness without the Holy Ghost is well you can telling me you ain't got it do you have what you talking about you what you preaching about do you have it Lord
