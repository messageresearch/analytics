[36:53] scripture is fulfilled so there was a
[36:56] a portion that he fulfilled in his first
[36:59] coming but there's also some promises
[37:02] for the people of god in this second
[37:04] coming
[37:05] and all i'm coming to do this morning is
[37:06] just remind you everything that god
[37:08] already promised you what he said in the
[37:11] word and we know his word is true amen
[37:14] then we go on from there isaiah 61 1 it
[37:17] reads this morning the spirit of the
[37:19] lord god is upon me
[37:23] to god how many can say that this
[37:24] morning the spirit of the lord god is
[37:27] upon me amen
[37:29] amen people got a lot of spirits running
[37:31] rampant on them nowadays but if god has
[37:34] blessed you with his spirit amen
[37:36] that spirit is above all those other
[37:38] spirits the spirit of the lord god is
[37:40] upon me because the lord has anointed me
[37:44] to preach good tidings
[37:47] unto the meek amen that's the good news
[37:49] i mean there's a lot of bad news going
[37:50] on but we preaching good news this
[37:52] morning man
[37:53] he has sent me
[37:55] to bind up the brokenhearted amen
[37:58] to proclaim liberty to the
[38:02] captives and the opening of the prison
[38:06] to them that abound amen prison is a bad
[38:09] predicament but he can open up the
[38:10] prison this morning
[38:12] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[38:15] lord amen and then when jesus was in his
[38:17] natural ministry he stopped right there
[38:18] because that's what he was there to do
[38:19] in his first coming amen the rest of
[38:22] this is going to apply to the second
[38:23] coming to the third coming amen so he
[38:25] proclaimed a separated law and now he's
[38:27] talking about end the day of vengeance
[38:29] about god
[38:31] you know the enemy looked like he went
[38:32] in a lot right now amen but god is going
[38:35] to get his vengeance and that's what the
[38:37] word says you don't have to worry about
[38:39] it god says he's going to do it amen the
[38:41] defense of our god
[38:43] to comfort
[38:45] all that mourn amen that's a promise
[38:48] to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
[38:52] amen he was talking about natural zion
[38:55] natural jerusalem back then but but how
[38:57] many know we the new jerusalem amen
[39:00] to point out them that mourning zion
[39:03] to give unto them
[39:04] beauty for ashes amen
[39:07] that's what we're going to draw emphasis
[39:08] on this morning because what you're
[39:10] going to see in this next part is is
[39:12] what god is gonna do he's gonna do a
[39:14] switch around
[39:15] it's certain things that you start out
[39:17] with but then he promises other things
[39:21] on the other half amen
[39:23] so he says he's gonna give unto them
[39:25] beauty
[39:26] for ashes he's going to give you the oil
[39:29] of joy
[39:31] for mourning
[39:33] the garment of praise
[39:36] for the spirit of heaviness
[39:39] that they might be called
[39:41] trees of righteousness
[39:44] hallelujah the planting of the lord
[39:47] that he might be glorified amen
[39:51] our title this morning is going to be
[39:53] beauty for ashes amen let's just buy
[39:56] hairs this morning in a word of prayer
[39:58] beauty for ashes
[40:01] father god in the name of jesus lord

[40:08] anointing dear god
[40:10] we thank you for that anointing lord we
[40:12] thank you for the song song lord
[40:15] each and every believer lord that press
[40:17] their way out to the service lord
[40:20] because we got one objective and that's
[40:22] to lift up your name father

[40:26] strengthened the saints and the servants
[40:27] this morning their god lord would you
[40:29] bless them by the preaching of your word
[40:31] dear god lord all of these things are
[40:33] being vain except you blessed by the
[40:35] word lord but you promise to do it dear
[40:37] god lord you gave us a message lord that
[40:40] is special to us dear god it's allowed
[40:43] your people to stand it's allowed your
[40:45] people to be firm dear god
[40:47] lord we pray to your blessed brother
[40:48] simmons lord as he's on his travels lord
[40:50] may he come back strengthen and renew to
[40:53] god bless his family to god maybe the
[40:55] ones who couldn't make it hit today law
[40:57] but they're streaming by the way of
[40:59] technology lord may you bless them this
[41:01] morning lord we look to you lord because
[41:03] you are to give all things dear god we
[41:06] worship you we worship you alone in the
[41:08] lovely name of jesus christ let the same
[41:10] say amen this morning hallelujah you can
[41:12] be seated this morning
[41:20] you know as we go through the years and
[41:22] and you spend more time with the lord
[41:25] you you get understanding of exactly uh
[41:28] who he is and and how he has a way of
[41:31] operating sometimes
[41:33] and what we find is that god is a simple
[41:36] god amen brother branham say he hides
[41:38] himself in simplicity amen
[41:41] but at the same time in simplicity we
[41:44] find that there are ways that god
[41:46] unfolds himself amen
[41:49] he unfolds himself he he wants to be
[41:51] able to manifest himself as a healer so
[41:53] he allows people to get sick sometimes
[41:56] he wants to be able to manifest himself
[41:58] as a comforter amen so so he allows
[42:01] things that happen that gets us
[42:03] uncomfortable sometimes he wants to
[42:05] manifest himself as being a provider so
[42:08] he gives you need from time to time and
[42:10] man he he wants to manifest himself as
[42:13] being jehovah sharma as somebody that is
[42:16] always with you so he has to allow you
[42:18] to feel alone from time to time what god
[42:21] does is he sets up circumstances
[42:24] and what those circumstances do it's not
[42:27] just that a breaker's down but it's
[42:29] there for almighty god to unfold himself
[42:32] amen
[42:33] because he has things that he wants to
[42:36] express amen he has desires amen he has
[42:39] ways that he wants to reveal himself
[42:42] unto you amen amen
[42:45] and what we find out with god is god is
[42:48] a progressive god amen amen progressive
[42:51] means that sometimes things look like
[42:54] they start out slowly sometimes it look
[42:56] like you could barely get one foot in
[42:58] front of the other but if you stick with
[43:00] them and if you stick under the teaching
[43:03] of the word amen what the word do is
[43:06] it'll start to strengthen you
[43:08] what the word do is it'll start to
[43:11] establish you it'll allow you to grow
[43:14] and allow you to move forward
[43:17] and even when things going on that might
[43:19] be a misunderstanding and hard to
[43:22] understand we start to get that
[43:24] revelation that paul said in romans 8 28
[43:28] that we know that all things work
[43:30] together amen
[43:32] we know that all things work together
[43:34] for the good amen to those that love the
[43:36] lord amen the ones that are called
[43:39] according to his purpose amen
[43:41] and and see it it takes a progression in
[43:44] your revelation to be able to say that
[43:46] amen
[43:48] because there's some things that go on
[43:51] and it does not look like those things
[43:53] are working together amen but if the
[43:55] scripture said it amen and we know our
[43:58] god is a progressive god he has to make
[44:00] his word come to pass amen can i get
[44:03] amen for somebody this morning amen i
[44:05] hope that you're with me this morning
[44:08] and and sometimes when it seems like the
[44:11] lord is breaking down things around us
[44:14] amen
[44:14] he's using those things to build us up
[44:17] on other side amen
[44:19] and sometimes when we go through a
[44:21] situation amen sometimes it's to prepare
[44:24] us for the next situation amen
[44:26] and sometimes it's to prepare us for the
[44:28] situation after that amen
[44:31] but our god has already promised that we
[44:34] got the victory in all things amen
[44:36] through jesus christ hallelujah how many
[44:38] of the lord this morning
[44:42] now with us being christians amen and us
[44:45] taking on the name of christ amen and us
[44:48] having salvation under the name of
[44:50] christ we got to understand this morning
[44:52] that there are promises that come under
[44:54] the name of christ amen
[44:56] jesus christ when he came here he came
[44:59] here for a purpose glory to god and one
[45:01] of the things that we read here under
[45:04] isaiah 61 when jesus christ was on the
[45:07] scene and he stood up in the synagogue
[45:10] amen that morning to to read what the
[45:12] word already said about him he started
[45:15] to talk about the freedom that will come
[45:17] in christ amen
[45:18] hallelujah i see this hook right here
[45:20] man
[45:21] he he he start to talk about the purpose
[45:24] that he came from and if you could grab
[45:26] ahold of the purpose amen if you could
[45:29] be blessed with the revelation to see
[45:31] the purpose amen he said and he came to
[45:34] make sure that you are free
[45:37] in a time where people are bound they
[45:39] bound physically they bow mentally they
[45:42] bound emotionally but jesus christ
[45:45] already spoke better things over you he
[45:47] came to make sure that you are free amen
[45:51] and yeah we talk about freedom on the
[45:53] other side we talk about our rewards
[45:55] coming into heaven amen but i'm here to
[45:57] tell you that god has given you your
[46:00] freedom now man he's giving you a
[46:03] portion of your inheritance to have
[46:06] right now
[46:07] and when people are all worried amen and
[46:10] when people are all concerned and
[46:12] stressed out and perplexed almighty god
[46:15] has already said amen he's came to
[46:18] preach good tidings amen
[46:21] good tidings is the good news of the
[46:23] gospel
[46:25] all we see in the news is bad news all
[46:29] over the place amen
[46:30] bad news about the virus say man bad
[46:33] news about loved ones oh my every time i
[46:36] talk to the people back home and
[46:37] something else going on amen so much bad
[46:40] news amen bad news in the political
[46:43] realm in afghanistan all those things
[46:45] it's just a bunch of bad news
[46:48] but you know we got good titans here
[46:50] this morning
[46:51] and sometimes you got to focus on the
[46:53] good tidings amen that's the good news i
[46:55] mean the good information you got to
[46:57] focus on those things because those are
[46:59] going to be the things that are going to
[47:01] keep you amen
[47:06] isaiah 61 amen i'm a simple preacher man
[47:09] i just like to point and shoot and let
[47:11] the word speak for itself amen
[47:13] he said the lord has anointed me to
[47:15] preach good times and to the meat
[47:17] he has sent me to bind up the broken
[47:20] heart today man
[47:21] you know a broken heart is a thing
[47:23] that's not easy to fix say man
[47:26] a broken heart is something that man's
[47:28] medicine i mean man could give you some
[47:30] medicine to help you out amen but that
[47:32] still can't fully fix a broken heart
[47:34] amen
[47:35] a broken heart amen is a tough thing
[47:38] it's a terrible thing amen but we got
[47:41] somebody who can bind up the broken
[47:44] heart today man
[47:45] the great physician the way he operates
[47:49] with his surgery amen when he comes in
[47:52] amen he can bind up the pieces of the
[47:56] broken heart amen that's a promise that
[47:59] he gave amen we can't do it on our own
[48:02] man can't do it but almighty god
[48:04] promised that he could do it amen
[48:08] he said if you're a captain of amen he
[48:10] can give you liberty
[48:12] if you're in prison he can open the
[48:15] doors of the prison house amen that's
[48:18] what he came to do that's what he
[48:20] established in his first coming and
[48:22] everybody that accepted the name of
[48:24] jesus christ amen everybody took time to
[48:27] be baptized
[48:29] in the name of the lord jesus on acts 2
[48:31] 38 amen you submitted yourself over to
[48:34] him those are promises that he's already
[48:37] given you those are promises he's
[48:39] already blessed you with you take the
[48:41] promise of god and you keep moving
[48:43] forward in it amen
[48:46] but then he starts to move amen from the
[48:49] first portion of his ministry where he
[48:51] at the end amen if you read it in luke 4
[48:54] about luke 4 18 luke 4 19 is where you
[48:57] find this thought in the new testament
[48:58] amen and he ends the thought right there
[49:00] amen but now there's a a greater
[49:03] opportunity amen for us in these last
[49:06] days amen
[49:07] for us who's living in the time of his
[49:09] second coming amen
[49:11] and we had to preach to you amen the
[49:12] second coming of christ is on now amen
[49:15] and there's promises that that he gives
[49:17] you in the second coming amen how do we
[49:19] know the second coming of christ is all
[49:20] night man because he's hearing you this
[49:22] morning amen
[49:24] you reveal him out everywhere that you
[49:26] go amen everywhere that you travel amen
[49:28] how you dress how you conduct yourselves
[49:30] amen you showing that jesus christ is
[49:32] here again amen
[49:34] and he promised he would come a minute
[49:36] he's already here and operating
[49:38] so in the second coming amen he talks
[49:40] about van just saying man we mention
[49:42] those things amen but in isaiah uh uh 62
[49:46] and and and two amen as we get past
[49:49] today avengers say man he says that he's
[49:51] going to comfort all that morning man
[49:54] you know it's been a time a great
[49:55] morning they've been over the last year
[49:57] or two
[49:59] but you know he said he would be a
[50:00] confident amen
[50:02] matthew 5 4 he says bless the day the
[50:04] morning amen for the shall be comforted
[50:06] amen and see i'm here to remind you that
[50:09] this morning because see we need that
[50:11] from him amen
[50:13] there will be things that go on that
[50:15] will cause us to mourn there will be
[50:17] heartaches that go on that cause us to
[50:20] mourn amen but in the midst of all of
[50:22] those things i'm here to remind you this
[50:25] morning he said that he would be here to
[50:28] be a confidant and i'm rested on the
[50:30] word of god this morning amen
[50:34] see once he establishes those things
[50:37] amen and as you go through things and as
[50:39] he has the things that it seems like the
[50:42] enemy has put in and things that uh the
[50:45] enemy seems like he's put on your track
[50:47] amen what almighty god is doing he's
[50:50] upgrading those things amen
[50:52] he's doing a swap around hey man the
[50:54] sisters they meant sometimes you like to
[50:56] get your car upgraded hey man
[50:58] the lord blessing some of y'all i mean
[51:00] you're getting your houses upgraded amen
[51:02] and if you can get things upgraded in
[51:04] the natural amenities

[51:11] minute and come out another way man
[51:14] and it don't be no no five and ten
[51:16] dollar head some of those things are
[51:17] very expensive i'm starting to learn
[51:18] about those things amen
[51:20] because we like to be upgraded amen
[51:23] so so so if i if man naturally is in the
[51:27] business upgrading amen how much more
[51:29] can god show up that he isn't the best
[51:33] upgrade
[51:35] now what the scripture is saying for
[51:38] zion amen for jerusalem amen and we are
[51:41] new jerusalem amen the book of
[51:42] revelation says that city came down like
[51:44] a bride of dawn for a husband amen so we
[51:47] manifest not south as new jerusalem so
[51:49] the scripture is saying that for the
[51:51] people of jerusalem amen uh for the
[51:54] people of new jerusalem he he's gonna do
[51:57] some upgrading he's gonna do some
[51:59] switching around
[52:01] the first thing he mentions amen i'm
[52:04] gonna give unto them beauty for ashes
[52:06] amen
[52:08] and and that's a curious thing to say
[52:10] beauty for ashes what does that mean
[52:16] you know we all go through periods of
[52:18] time amen where it seems like it's just
[52:21] nothing but ashes amen
[52:23] the ashes are the burn over things of
[52:26] your life amen the things that the fire
[52:29] has done the rage and the fires done
[52:32] ravaged and one point in time it was
[52:35] green trees and green leaves and
[52:37] everything was looking good but because
[52:40] the fire was so rough and violent they
[52:42] man
[52:43] and fire is so indiscriminate all the
[52:46] fire has left behind its ashes amen
[52:50] those ashes ain't even know those those
[52:52] worn down things in life though those
[52:55] burn over things and like see sometimes
[52:57] we get in the ashes well some when job
[53:00] was was going through his issue job was
[53:02] on the ash heap amen
[53:04] the ashes are the low point amen
[53:07] the parts that you would throw away man
[53:09] there's ways they mean there's no it's
[53:11] no good that comes out of ashes amen
[53:15] but you know god says in the midst of
[53:17] your ashes amen
[53:19] i got something for you amen
[53:22] i got beauty for your ashes amen
[53:25] you know i like the word beauty man
[53:27] because he's the fairest of ten thousand
[53:29] i mean everybody's looking for beauty
[53:31] man
[53:32] the sisters want beauty i mean even the
[53:33] brothers want beauty amen because they
[53:35] want a beautiful young lady or something
[53:36] like that amen we all looking for beauty
[53:39] amen but the lord says amen he got a
[53:41] different kind of beauty for you and it
[53:44] comes from your ashes amen
[53:48] there's beauty in the holiness of god
[53:50] amen
[53:51] it's a psalm that says beauty and the
[53:52] brokenness amen
[53:54] there's beauty from the ashes amen and
[53:57] there might be a point in time where you
[53:59] start out with ashes but god said i'm
[54:01] not gonna just let you stay there with
[54:03] ashes i'm gonna build you up again and
[54:06] i'm not just gonna build you from ashes
[54:08] to halfway i'm going to build you from
[54:10] ashes to a state of beauty amen i'm
[54:13] going to put something on you amen that
[54:15] nothing else in this world will be able
[54:17] to touch amen i'm going to give you
[54:20] beauty for ashes
[54:24] the ashes amen if you look at numbers
[54:26] the 19th chapter and the ashes are
[54:28] actually a part of your sacrifice to me
[54:31] numbers 19 amen the lord he talks about
[54:34] uh the sacrifice that the people of
[54:36] israel needed to give amen and numbers
[54:39] 19 what it talks about is it talks about
[54:41] the red heifer
[54:42] and the red half of what the people were
[54:45] supposed to do amen was that the the
[54:47] priest was supposed to come in and get
[54:50] this red hair for it man it had to be a
[54:53] a red hat for that it did not have any
[54:55] spot did not have any blemish never had
[54:58] a yoke upon it amen it had to be perfect
[55:01] and actually what they would do is they
[55:02] would take the red half outside the camp
[55:05] sacrificed the heifer burn it amen and
[55:08] the ashes were but something special
[55:11] from that red half of that they burned
[55:12] amen
[55:14] brother branham picks up the thought
[55:15] amen and think of mansfield 1965 amen he
[55:18] said when israel sinned
[55:20] and recognized they had done wrong
[55:22] then they were sprinkled with the ashes
[55:25] of this half upon him amen
[55:27] and that was a water of separation
[55:31] a purification for city man so what
[55:34] happened in the midst of their ashes
[55:36] they meant to miss that bad thing it was
[55:38] actually a purification it was actually
[55:40] a separation from san francis the ashes
[55:44] were something that were used to get
[55:46] them closer to their god again amen
[55:49] so what he does amen even for you and
[55:51] your ashes amen those things are used to
[55:55] bring you closer to the lord again amen
[55:57] and he said you might be at a low point
[56:00] you might be battling some things right
[56:02] now but he promised your beauty on the
[56:04] other side and you got to accept what
[56:06] almighty god has already given you amen
[56:10] he mentions another thing in the
[56:11] scripture amen
[56:13] the or of joy for mourning amen
[56:17] the all the joy for mourning
[56:20] you know some people in in the midst of
[56:22] uh uh of battling amen and grinding
[56:26] against the enemy you see how people
[56:27] lose the joy of their salvation
[56:29] sometimes amen
[56:31] but you know he's a restorer of joy this
[56:34] morning amen
[56:36] he said it might be some morning amen
[56:39] there's things that go on that make you

[1:02:53] arguing with each other i had to deal
[1:02:54] with that amen but that's because people
[1:02:56] were dealing with spirits of heaviness

[1:03:15] try to do naturally
[1:03:18] but but but if that spirit of heaviness
[1:03:20] is on you
[1:03:22] that is something that is hard to break
[1:03:24] my god is hard to break

[1:04:25] on you amen that is a burden that's on
[1:04:28] you that is the spirit of heaven and
[1:04:30] saving but what he says is is cast your
[1:04:34] cares upon him amen
[1:04:36] he said learn to me take a maya okay man
[1:04:40] his yoke is different from our yoke amen
[1:04:43] his yoke is easy
[1:04:45] and his burdens amen those burdens are
[1:04:48] light
[1:04:50] what we have to do amen to move past the

[1:05:08] wants to be the one who brightens your
[1:05:11] candle so you can stand as a light in
[1:05:14] the midst of a wicked and dark
[1:05:15] generation you can still stand as a
[1:05:18] believer and show that there's a real

[1:08:28] inside amen to give unto them beautiful
[1:08:30] ashes amen beauty for your ashes
[1:08:32] to all the joy for mourning amen
[1:08:36] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[1:08:37] heaviness why
[1:08:39] that they might be called
[1:08:42] trees
[1:08:43] of righteousness amen
[1:08:45] the planting of the lord amen
[1:08:47] that me he might be glorified even
[1:08:50] that we might be called
[1:08:52] trees of righteousness amen
[1:08:55] you know when god does the planning of
[1:08:58] the tree amen
[1:09:00] it establishes you amen
[1:09:02] but psalms one amen that his leaf shall
[1:09:04] not wither amen whatever you do shall
[1:09:06] prosper i mean should be like a tree
[1:09:08] planted by the rivers of water amen
[1:09:10] when god plants you as a tree amen your
[1:09:13] root structure is different amen
[1:09:15] when god plants you as a tree amen and
[1:09:18] you know some trees they man i'm from
[1:09:20] the low country man and what i've
[1:09:22] noticed is it can be some giant trees
[1:09:25] out there and we had a lot of hurricanes
[1:09:27] over the last 10 years or so
[1:09:29] and some trees that are very big and
[1:09:31] very strong i mean it would be
[1:09:32] surprising at the end of the storm that
[1:09:35] those trees would be blowed over i mean
[1:09:37] that thing was surprising boy that's a
[1:09:39] big tree
[1:09:40] and when something like wind could blow
[1:09:42] nothing but air could blow on that big
[1:09:44] tree and knock it over
[1:09:46] but what happens when you look at the
[1:09:48] root structure of the tree amen you
[1:09:50] notice that the tree has shallow roots
[1:09:53] as big and as large as the tree was
[1:09:56] because the tree did not have roots that
[1:09:59] went deep in the ground it just had a
[1:10:00] lot of superficial roots say man and
[1:10:02] that's what happened with a lot of
[1:10:03] christians they got a lot of superficial
[1:10:05] roots on the outside to look good on the
[1:10:07] outside praise the lord everything all
[1:10:08] right amen but see nothing never get
[1:10:11] down deep and get established
[1:10:13] and when the storm starts to blow a man
[1:10:16] you gonna need something that gets down
[1:10:18] deep amen and that and that will
[1:10:20] establish you amen
[1:10:22] so it will be trees that on the outside
[1:10:26] from me looking at the top of the tree i
[1:10:28] thought that that tree would not be
[1:10:31] strong enough to withstand the storm
[1:10:33] amen but that tree that did not look so
[1:10:36] good from the ground up amen it was able
[1:10:39] to withstand the storm and man because
[1:10:42] his root system was different amen
[1:10:45] see saints your root system is different
[1:10:47] amen when you come out to church or two
[1:10:50] three times a week amen what it's doing
[1:10:53] is this establishing your root system
[1:10:56] when you dig into the word amen and you
[1:10:59] follow the things that the prophet of
[1:11:00] god is shoulder say man what those
[1:11:03] things do is they establish a root
[1:11:06] system amen and that way when the wind
[1:11:08] blows you will still be able to stand
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:14] now if the wrong person planted you amen
[1:11:17] you're not going to be able to withstand
[1:11:18] these storms
[1:11:20] but i'm here to remind you who planted
[1:11:22] you this morning almighty god planted
[1:11:25] you today man
[1:11:27] if almighty god planted you amen that
[1:11:30] means almighty god is gonna sustain you
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:34] if he sustained you amen he planted you
[1:11:37] that mean he gonna water you amen when
[1:11:39] you need water
[1:11:40] he's gonna give you sunshine when you
[1:11:42] need sunshine amen if you need growth
[1:11:45] he's gonna give you growth amen because
[1:11:48] you are history of righteousness you are
[1:11:52] the planting of the lord you are special
[1:11:55] unto him this morning amen
[1:11:57] there might be a lot of conditions
[1:11:59] that's out there on the scene that might
[1:12:01] try to keep the planting of the lord
[1:12:04] from growing and from prospering but i'm
[1:12:06] here to tell you this morning that god
[1:12:08] uses all those things for his glory amen
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:13] i'm gonna tell you a quick story on the
[1:12:15] way out amen when i was looking at
[1:12:17] different plants and different
[1:12:18] conditions and things amen you know
[1:12:20] plants we all know plants need sun and
[1:12:22] water they need special conditions amen
[1:12:25] but certain plants need more than that
[1:12:27] man
[1:12:27] there's a plant called a tulip a man a
[1:12:29] flower called a tulip it man it's very
[1:12:31] beautiful flower a minute your brother's
[1:12:33] not familiar with him and get your wife
[1:12:34] some tulips she'll love it amen
[1:12:37] but you know the thing about a tulip is
[1:12:39] just because it gets planted amen
[1:12:42] and gets planted maybe in the uh some
[1:12:45] fall or whatever with a tulip it
[1:12:47] actually needs a certain amount of cold
[1:12:49] weather
[1:12:50] in order for it to be able to go in the
[1:12:52] springtime if it don't get like those
[1:12:54] six or twelve weeks of cold enough
[1:12:57] weather it's not gonna grow in the
[1:12:58] springtime what happens is it needs
[1:13:00] certain conditions in order for it to be
[1:13:02] able to grow and manifest itself amen
[1:13:05] and you would think well why would a
[1:13:07] plant need a certain amount of winter
[1:13:08] time to be able to grow again in the
[1:13:10] summertime that's just how god ordered
[1:13:12] it amen so sometimes when we're going
[1:13:14] through wintertime amen in our lives i
[1:13:16] mean we're going through wintertime
[1:13:18] spiritually and naturally and we wonder
[1:13:20] how we're going to get growth out of
[1:13:21] those things if god can use that winter
[1:13:25] time to bring forth a tulip amen how
[1:13:27] much more can he use your winter time to
[1:13:30] bring forth something out of your life
[1:13:32] amen
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:34] it got to have in a couple weeks of
[1:13:36] winter amen but then it needs that
[1:13:38] spring to come amen and the spring comes
[1:13:41] again amen and the summer comes again
[1:13:43] and it blossoms and it blooms amen and
[1:13:46] it manifests itself amen
[1:13:50] he does all of those things amen
[1:13:53] scripture says he does all of these
[1:13:55] things
[1:13:57] that he might be glorified amen
[1:14:01] the scripture amen is he taking you
[1:14:02] through all these things a minute they
[1:14:04] might be called trees of righteousness
[1:14:06] the planning of the lord that he might
[1:14:09] be glorified amen
[1:14:11] you know we get to the point amen when
[1:14:13] we start to understand that everything
[1:14:15] in your life amen even the things that
[1:14:17] look shaky even confusing amen that god
[1:14:20] still use those things to get the glory
[1:14:22] out of you amen
[1:14:24] it's a mystery man but he uses those
[1:14:27] things that he might be glorified
[1:14:30] the most important thing that we can do
[1:14:33] as the creation of almighty god is
[1:14:36] glorify him
[1:14:38] as being something that worships him as
[1:14:41] being something that lives a life that
[1:14:43] that's desiring and pleasing unto him
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:47] the angels couldn't necessarily worship
[1:14:49] him like we worshipping amen because
[1:14:51] he's done something different for us
[1:14:53] amen and he brings us through all of
[1:14:56] those things amen that he might be
[1:14:59] glorified amen
[1:15:01] that we might move into his image amen
[1:15:05] that we be conformed into the image of
[1:15:07] the son amen that's what happened after
[1:15:09] romans 8 28 romans 8 29 says that we
[1:15:12] could be conformed into the image of his
[1:15:14] son amen after we know that all things
[1:15:16] work together those who are to call them
[1:15:18] and those that love them amen then we
[1:15:20] get conformed to the image of the son
[1:15:24] he does all of these things amen that we
[1:15:26] could be in his image amen
[1:15:28] that we can manifest more of the
[1:15:31] character of god amen that he could be
[1:15:34] glorified that there will be a people
[1:15:37] that no matter what goes on they hold on
[1:15:40] to the word amen that they will have
[1:15:43] that jacob mentality that i will not let
[1:15:46] you go until you bless me amen
[1:15:49] that they will have the mindset that
[1:15:51] they will hold on that they will
[1:15:53] recognize that the word of god is their
[1:15:57] absolute amen
[1:15:59] and the thing about the absolute is is
[1:16:02] you try other things and once you find
[1:16:04] out that those things don't hold
[1:16:07] and when the storm blows over your life
[1:16:10] and you reach out and you hold on to
[1:16:12] almighty god and you hold on to the word
[1:16:16] of god and at the end of the storm you
[1:16:19] find out that you are still standing
[1:16:21] what that reveals out to you is that
[1:16:23] almighty god is the absolute for you
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:27] and the absolute
[1:16:29] it holds on amen the absolute when you
[1:16:32] tried everything else that you know that
[1:16:34] this thing is secure
[1:16:37] you don't got nowhere else to go you
[1:16:39] could be like heeded to alone where else
[1:16:41] would we go
[1:16:43] you alone got the words of eternal life
[1:16:45] baby
[1:16:46] he's our absolute this morning amen
[1:16:50] he does these things for our glory amen
[1:16:53] it starts out with hard things amen
[1:16:56] beautiful for our ashes hey man you
[1:16:58] might have some ashes amen but it gives
[1:16:59] us beautiful ashes amen
[1:17:02] there might be more than amen but he
[1:17:03] promised you the oil of joy amen
[1:17:07] it might be a spirit of heaviness but he
[1:17:08] said he'll give you the garment of
[1:17:10] praise amen
[1:17:12] and then right before we go as we close
[1:17:13] amen
[1:17:14] you know the pride for the guy he tells
[1:17:16] a story amen how he was walking in
[1:17:19] british columbia amen up in canada
[1:17:22] and he was walking uh through the woods
[1:17:24] and walking on different trails and
