[9:43] [Music]
[9:51] and you got to say amen
[9:58] amen first corinthians chapter 13 and it
[10:00] reads
[10:03] though i speak with the tongues of men
[10:05] and angels
[10:06] and have not charity i am become as a
[10:09] sounding brass or
[10:10] tinkling symbol and though i have the
[10:12] gift of prophecy and understand all
[10:14] mysteries
[10:16] and all and all knowledge and though i
[10:18] have all faith
[10:20] so that i can remove mountains and have
[10:23] not charity i am nothing
[10:25] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[10:27] the poor
[10:28] and though i give my body to be burned
[10:31] and have not
[10:32] charity it profiteth me nothing
[10:35] charity suffereth long and is kind
[10:37] charity envy is not
[10:39] cherry vaunted not itself and is not
[10:42] puffed up
[10:43] does not behave unseemly seek his
[10:47] not her own and is not easily pro
[10:50] provoked thinking no evil rejoices not
[10:53] in iniquity but rejoices in truth
[10:56] bearing all things believeth all things
[10:59] hopeth all things endureth all things
[11:03] charity never faileth but whether there
[11:05] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[11:07] there be
[11:08] tongues they shall cease whether there
[11:10] be knowledge it shall vanish away
[11:12] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[11:15] part
[11:16] but when that which is perfect is come
[11:19] then that which is part
[11:20] shall be done away amen god bless the
[11:22] reading of his word
[11:24] may be seated
[11:29] tonight we'd like to speak on a little
[11:31] topic
[11:32] um called have you fallen in love yet
[11:37] have you fallen in love yet
[11:42] just this book in the first corinthians
[11:46] chapter 13 it speaks about charity and
[11:51] in the seventh verse it says it beareth
[11:53] all things and believeth all things
[11:55] hope with all things endure all things
[11:58] and lord was working on me have you
[12:01] fallen in love yet
[12:02] and there are many things in the bible
[12:05] many scriptures and
[12:06] things that point to the love that
[12:09] that that god bless his servants and
[12:12] people in the bible
[12:14] and the love that we should have for god
[12:16] and
[12:18] it's a love that is not partial it's not
[12:21] something that
[12:24] we look at and we understand that
[12:27] this love it it bears all things it
[12:30] takes on
[12:32] it takes on a life it takes on a form
[12:34] for itself
[12:36] and jesus he
[12:39] seeing that easter was sunday it came to
[12:42] my attention how
[12:43] god loved us so much that he went to the
[12:46] cross and he died for us
[12:48] for just a thought and
[12:52] it was it was it was powerful but it
[12:54] started me to ask the question to myself
[12:57] have i fallen in love yet have i fallen
[13:00] in love with god
[13:01] so much that things don't matter
[13:05] that things can pass away things can
[13:07] move on
[13:08] things could happen but it's never
[13:10] wavers and it never
[13:11] shakes who i am and it's building up a
[13:15] life and building up a testimony of the
[13:17] love that i have for him
[13:19] in the let's turn to the book of job
[13:22] job chapter 13.
[13:30] on the story of job job was a
[13:35] job was a man that
[13:38] i think sometimes i think and i say god
[13:40] put stories in the bible
[13:42] just for us just for us to see that
[13:46] there are things that everything ain't
[13:48] sunshine and rainbows sometimes
[13:50] there are hardships and trials that you
[13:52] go through
[13:53] and job was one of those stories that he
[13:55] put in there and they say that job was
[13:57] the first book of the bible
[13:59] and in job chapter 13 and um
[14:03] but before we go there we know the story
[14:06] of job how he went through
[14:07] he went through so much in his life he
[14:10] went from
[14:10] owning land owning cattle having a big
[14:13] family
[14:14] everything seemed to be going right with
[14:15] job and everything was
[14:17] and the devil came to god and he said
[14:19] god the only reason that he's serving
[14:21] you
[14:21] only reason that he loves you is because
[14:23] you're doing so much for them
[14:25] you're doing this you're doing that and
[14:26] you you got to head your protection
[14:28] around them
[14:29] and god god knew who joe was and how
[14:32] much love he had for him so he said
[14:33] all right go ahead and test them so god
[14:36] allowed the devil to take his land
[14:38] god allowed the devil to take his his
[14:41] cattle take his sheep take his ox and
[14:43] take
[14:43] take his camels and then god and then
[14:46] the devil probably came back to god and
[14:48] said
[14:49] you ain't let me do enough you keeping
[14:51] that hedge around them so
[14:52] god said okay just don't take his life
[14:55] and he said so the devil went back and
[14:57] then he killed his family
[14:59] and then he caused his wife to turn
[15:01] against job
[15:03] and then in chapter 13 and verse
[15:06] 15 joel goes on to make the statement he
[15:08] says
[15:10] though though he slayed me yet will i
[15:14] trust in him
[15:15] but i will maintain my own ways before
[15:17] him he
[15:18] also shall be my salvation for a
[15:21] hypocrite shall not come before him
[15:23] and job was saying here to his friends
[15:25] he said
[15:26] though god put me through all this
[15:29] though i've been through so much
[15:31] though i've i got boils on my skin and
[15:34] it looked like i'm gonna die
[15:36] though he slayed me i'm gonna trust him
[15:38] because he knew that he had that love
[15:40] for god
[15:40] that love that passes all understanding
[15:43] that he knew that god was
[15:45] and it came to my attention the other
[15:47] day i was thinking i was like job was
[15:49] the first book of the bible
[15:50] he didn't have a reference book he
[15:52] couldn't look back at what god was going
[15:54] to promise him
[15:55] he didn't know that god was god was
[15:57] going as the scripture said supply all
[15:59] his needs
[16:00] he just knew that he said naked i came
[16:03] into this world naked i shall return
[16:05] so he knew that god what he trusted so
[16:08] much in god
[16:09] and loved him so much that he was
[16:10] willing to he would knew that if
[16:12] everything goes away
[16:14] i never i'll never leave god i'll never
[16:16] turn away from him
[16:18] and that's the love that i think that
[16:20] that sometimes i look and i
[16:22] ask myself do i have that type of love
[16:24] do i have that type of love towards my
[16:25] father
[16:26] for towards my fellow man because the
[16:29] bible says
[16:30] as you do to the least one of these
[16:32] you've done it unto me
[16:34] so it doesn't matter who it is and and
[16:36] he goes on and he says in the scripture
[16:38] job says
[16:39] though you slayed me i will trust you
[16:42] which means that i
[16:43] even though i'm going through all of
[16:45] this i'm never going to wave and
[16:47] waver in the love that god has given me
[16:50] and i looked at that same love you see
[16:51] in the new testament
[16:53] it was the love that jesus had when he
[16:54] died on the cross for us
[16:56] it was a love that when he went there he
[16:58] just
[16:59] we were just thoughts in his mind
[17:02] generations in time that were coming in
[17:04] the future
[17:06] he only knew that we were there and even
[17:09] he said he knew what he was about to go
[17:11] to
[17:11] through and he said father if this if
[17:14] you allowed
[17:15] this cup to pass but not my will let thy
[17:18] will be done
[17:19] because his love for you and me i think
[17:22] one
[17:23] songwriter said he said only love held
[17:25] him there on the cross
[17:27] he could have called ten thousand angels
[17:29] to come to his rescue
[17:30] but only love held him there on the
[17:32] cross and i think about that love how
[17:35] strong that love was how
[17:37] powerful that love was and he knew that
[17:39] he was gonna
[17:40] he was gonna have love for all my sins
[17:43] for all my iniquity he was
[17:45] to pass over that and still love me
[17:46] enough to save me
[17:48] still die for me to shed his blood to go
[17:51] through to get to
[17:52] get the net get the whips on his back
[17:54] and the thorns in his head and
[17:56] hang on a cross to die for me he knew he
[17:59] knew that he was going to
[18:00] what he was going to go through but
[18:02] still he loved me so much
[18:04] he went through that for me and
[18:07] even i think of the story of joseph
[18:09] joseph and his brothers between genesis
[18:11] 37
[18:13] those are chapters in the bible but
[18:15] joseph he loved his
[18:17] he still showed love towards the ones
[18:20] that sold him into slavery
[18:22] the ones that despised him the ones that
[18:25] were jealous of him
[18:26] he still showed that love to him and he
[18:29] recognized that
[18:30] it wasn't his will it wasn't his plan if
[18:33] he could have chosen easier route to get
[18:34] where he needed to be
[18:36] he would have if he could have chose a
[18:38] different pathway
[18:39] he would have but because of because of
[18:42] the he recognized that
[18:44] all that he had been through that they
[18:47] were still
[18:48] they were still the ones and god had
[18:49] placed him in that position for a reason
[18:52] so he loved his family when he saw them
[18:54] again now he put him through some tests
[18:57] because he put him through a little test
[19:00] here and there but
[19:02] he recognized that god only brought me
[19:04] here is by the grace of god i only made
[19:06] it here
[19:07] i took god took me through these things
[19:09] but it was all building character
[19:11] it wasn't about well i'm going through
[19:13] this so i should give up
[19:15] it wasn't about that this isn't i don't
[19:18] see how that's going to work out
[19:20] he loved he loved god in spite of he
[19:22] loved him in spite of what he was going
[19:24] through
[19:25] and i think about the prophet of god how
[19:26] he talks about his life story
[19:30] when he um when he when he lost his
[19:34] he lost his first wife and he lost his
[19:36] child with them
[19:37] within weeks of each other and what a
[19:40] powerful
[19:41] what hurtful thing that was for him
[19:44] but he said and how he came out of it
[19:47] and
[19:48] god had to take him beyond the curtain
[19:49] of time to see that they were still
[19:52] there they were in a better place than
[19:53] where he is now and i
[19:55] and i looked at it and i said that's the
[19:57] love of god lord loved his servant so
[19:59] much that he allowed him to see
[20:01] he allowed him to take him before him
[20:03] sometimes
[20:04] you don't know why you go through
[20:05] certain things you don't understand why
[20:08] certain things happen you question you
[20:10] question your path you question god
[20:13] but in spite of that you still have to
[20:15] love him because he loved you so much
[20:17] that
[20:17] he brought you here and he gave you
[20:19] opportunity one on one
[20:21] one of my friends he always says you
[20:23] know what one of the most powerful
[20:24] things you have is your will
[20:26] because god put you on earth he gave
[20:28] your will
[20:30] your will to even reject him you can't
[20:33] even reach
[20:33] after all he did for you some people
[20:35] still reject god
[20:37] but god put us sometimes i think where
[20:39] would i be if god hadn't placed me in
[20:41] this specific place in this specific
[20:43] kind and sometimes you
[20:45] you think maybe i should i would have
[20:46] been better in this time or i would have
[20:48] been better with this so i would have
[20:50] been better with that
[20:51] but god knew exactly what you needed he
[20:53] loved you so much that he put you in the
[20:55] position that you are in
[20:57] because he knew that's what it was going
[20:59] to take to get you to where you needed
[21:01] to be he looked at
[21:02] you look at that and you you think back
[21:05] and you say well god
[21:06] sometimes you can't see why you go
[21:08] through things until years later
[21:10] when you look back over you see you see
[21:12] it and you say oh
[21:13] now i recognize why i had to go through
[21:15] that now
[21:16] i see why this happened and then
[21:19] sometimes you think back and you say oh
[21:21] god thank you for sparing me
[21:23] because i could have been out there i
[21:25] could have done a whole lot of things
[21:26] but
[21:27] only the love and the grace of god and
[21:29] his mercy that kept me
[21:31] from from being where i should have been
[21:33] and
[21:35] paul in the book actually he says acts
[21:39] 21 i'll just
[21:40] turn real quick but you don't have to
[21:41] acts 21-13
[21:44] he says paul came to the conclusion
[21:50] paul came to the conclusion that he had
[21:53] got arrested
[21:54] he got arrested and he was defending his
[21:57] case
[21:58] in jerusalem and chapter and verse 13
[22:02] 21-13 paul anson said what mean you to
[22:05] weak
[22:05] or break or break my heart for i am not
[22:08] i am ready not to be bound only but also
[22:11] to die at truth
[22:13] for the name of jesus of the lord jesus
[22:15] christ
[22:16] paul loved god so much that he was ready
[22:19] to die for him
[22:20] he realized how much god had done for
[22:23] him
[22:24] he had turned his whole life around even
[22:26] though paul grew up
[22:27] he grew up with a stellar background he
[22:30] got taught under the chief of the
[22:31] pharisees he
[22:32] he spoke many languages paul was some
[22:35] people say
[22:36] super super intelligent but sometimes
[22:39] god had
[22:40] god had to humble him and bring him back
[22:42] down and on the road to damascus he said
[22:44] saul saul why persecute his doubt me god
[22:47] loved him so much god could have let him
[22:49] keep going
[22:50] he could have let him keep going on that
[22:52] path and many people would have said
[22:54] with a call paul's path that he was
[22:56] headed on the road that he was headed on
[22:58] success many people would have seen that
[23:01] as
[23:02] this is what we call we define as
[23:04] success
[23:06] but god loved him so much that he
[23:08] stopped
[23:09] he pau he said no paul you you're not
[23:12] doing what
[23:13] what i want you to do you're not and
[23:15] paul said
[23:16] he said all the things that he had
[23:18] learned all the things that he had
[23:20] achieved he said it profited me nothing
[23:23] god loved him so much that he he stopped
[23:26] paul
[23:27] and made him realize that you're only
[23:29] here because of my love for you and my
[23:31] grace for you
[23:32] and he got to the point paul loved god
[23:35] so jesus so much that he said
[23:38] he said he said but
[23:41] for i am ready not to be bound only but
[23:45] but to die and it makes me it made me
[23:48] question myself and said
[23:49] am i ready do i love god that much that
[23:52] i understand what's my path and where
[23:55] i'm going
[23:56] and i understand what's the what's that
[23:59] next level what's that next level where
[24:01] where am i headed but do i love you
[24:03] enough to trust you
[24:05] god do i love you that much that i can
[24:08] trust you
[24:08] you can bring me into where you want me
[24:11] to be
[24:12] at a certain point you love and then you
[24:15] trust
[24:16] one once you trust god in such a
[24:19] powerful way
[24:20] it moves you to do things that you never
[24:22] thought that you would do
[24:23] it makes you it makes you sometimes go
[24:26] out of
[24:27] what you say my boundaries what what i'm
[24:30] used to
[24:31] because you love god so much that you
[24:34] trust him
[24:34] you trust that he has everything in
[24:37] control you trust that he
[24:39] he'll provide for you he'll take care of
[24:41] you sometimes you don't know why
[24:43] how things are gonna happen but you love
[24:45] god so much that god
[24:47] god whatever whatever your will is for
[24:50] my life
[24:51] whatever my path that i should take lord
[24:53] i'll trust you
[24:55] and he said so i asked the question
[24:59] have you fallen in love yet because love
[25:02] even though
[25:03] sometimes i tell people all the time as
[25:05] i say that
[25:06] i went to school and i i went to school
[25:09] enjoying
[25:09] what i did but when i came out i fell in
[25:12] i was in love with it
[25:13] and sometimes that didn't mean that i
[25:15] didn't have my butts in the road
[25:17] that didn't mean that everything was
[25:18] going straight in the path was wonderful
[25:21] and lovely
[25:22] and it was all sunshine and rainbows
[25:24] sometimes it was hard
[25:26] sometimes you failed sometimes you had
[25:28] to understand
[25:29] you had to get knocked down to get back
[25:31] up again and improved and made and made
[25:34] that
[25:34] it made that love stronger it made that
[25:37] love more powerful
[25:38] and it made you want to continue to go
[25:40] on
[25:41] even though it wasn't always pretty it
[25:43] wasn't always
[25:44] always fun and all always people didn't
[25:47] always have a smile on their face
[25:49] well i didn't always have and sometimes
[25:51] it was stressful but that
