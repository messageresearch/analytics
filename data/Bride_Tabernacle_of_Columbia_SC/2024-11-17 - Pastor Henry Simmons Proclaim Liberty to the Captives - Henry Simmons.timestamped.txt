[40:56] amen I love the Lord because he heard My
[41:00] Cry
[41:04] amen the Bible says here in songs I mean
[41:09] Isaiah 61 I don't know why I want to say
[41:12] song is 61
[41:15] And1 Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[41:19] because the Lord has anointed me to
[41:21] preach Good Tidings unto the
[41:24] meek he has sent me to buy line up the
[41:28] broken
[41:29] heart to Proclaim Liberty to the captive
[41:33] and the opening of the prison to them
[41:36] that are
[41:38] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[41:41] the
[41:42] Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God
[41:45] to comfort all that
[41:48] moan amen amen God bless you word you
[41:51] may be
[41:53] seated we want to go to Luke
[41:58] dealing with the
[41:59] same thing as Jesus quoted it but it
[42:04] sounds a little different in
[42:06] Luke Luke
[42:09] 4 and
[42:11] 16 and he came to Naz where he had been
[42:14] bought up and as his custom was he went
[42:20] into the synagog on the Sabbath day and
[42:23] stood up for to read
[42:27] and there was delivered unto him the
[42:31] book of the prophet
[42:34] Isaiah and when he had opened the book
[42:39] he found the place where it was
[42:44] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[42:47] me because he has anointed me to preach
[42:51] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[42:56] heal
[42:57] the broken
[42:59] heart to preach Deliverance to the
[43:03] captives and recovering of sight to the
[43:08] Blind and to set at
[43:10] liity them that are
[43:13] bruised to proclaim the acceptable year
[43:16] of the Lord and we notice that he didn't
[43:19] say the day of Vengeance of our god
[43:22] there Jesus said the acceptable year of
[43:25] the Lord amen
[43:28] amen I was talking to my nephew Marcus
[43:31] and David and and just suddenly a sermon
[43:35] just came out yesterday as I was talking
[43:37] to them I just went to writing
[43:41] amen and so by the grace of
[43:45] God I I I trust that it'll be meeting
[43:48] due season I guess this morning is just
[43:52] impressed upon my heart to Proclaim
[43:55] Liberty to the captive amen amen to
[43:58] Proclaim Liberty to the captain amen
[44:02] amen as we enjoyed our
[44:04] conversation and you know it came to me
[44:07] and talking uh uh uh about the word is
[44:11] the word amen amen yes the word never
[44:16] changes I said our our
[44:19] foundation of what we believe amen it's
[44:24] got to it's still valuable amen still
[44:27] stands amen I said
[44:31] but we're not under the law
[44:35] amen but we are under grace amen and let
[44:39] me just uh look at it from the
[44:42] standpoint in John 1
[44:45] and4 in John 1 and4 we're not under the
[44:50] law he led captivity captive in other
[44:53] words he Proclaim liity to the cap am
[44:57] amen he proclaimed Liberty to the
[45:00] captive
[45:02] amen and and um Luke bought out he he he
[45:09] he came to bring
[45:13] Deliverance Isaiah said those that were
[45:16] in prison
[45:18] amen so it's different perspectives and
[45:21] different angles that we can look at
[45:24] this from different stand points is
[45:27] causing who you are and where you are
[45:30] amen
[45:32] amen but we know
[45:36] that the proclaiming of Liberty to the
[45:43] captive it's uh uh an
[45:48] announcement that you can be delivered
[45:51] you can be free amen amen
[45:57] so he came to announce to you and I that
[46:01] we could be free
[46:05] amen so
[46:07] John excuse me John 1
[46:11] and4 it says and the Word was made flesh
[46:16] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[46:19] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[46:21] the father full of grace and
[46:23] truth and John be witness of him and
[46:27] cried
[46:29] saying this was he whom I speak he that
[46:35] cometh after me is preferred when before
[46:41] me for he
[46:44] was the Bible said in the beginning was
[46:46] a word and the
[46:49] word the word with was with God and the
[46:52] Word was
[46:54] God I was listening to some great
[46:57] preacher on the internet and he was
[47:00] saying
[47:01] that uh the when the word was made flesh
[47:06] he was not
[47:09] God I said Y and he got million uh of
[47:13] thousands and millions of
[47:15] Fallen
[47:17] especially uh the apostolic
[47:21] world and people uh because he talks
[47:24] mean and hard people want to follow
[47:28] that and I said you know this man look
[47:31] like he know what he talking about but
[47:34] when he tells me that the that he's not

[51:54] for of his fo goodess have all we
[51:59] receive and what Grace for
[52:02] Grace I I thought you know I was looking
[52:06] at the grace this morning and looking at
[52:10] grace and grace and all I thought about

[52:16] of
[52:17] God all I thought about is the love of
[52:20] God amen amen and you know and dealing
[52:24] with the children of God in the church
[52:25] today
[52:27] we it's all about love amen it's all
[52:30] about the grace of God Amen none of us
[52:33] are wory of anything amen it's all about
[52:38] the love of God and the grace of God
[52:40] Amen and I said you know we got nothing
[52:44] to boast about we got nothing to to down
[52:47] or look down on others about it's all
[52:49] about

[52:54] Amen by the grace of God I am am what I
[52:57] am amen amen and you are what you are
[53:00] it's only because of the love of God and
[53:03] the grace of God that's all we got
[53:07] nothing to BR brag about amen but his
[53:10] grace towards us amen amen thank you
[53:14] Jesus God loves
[53:17] us and that's what we ought to brag
[53:19] about yes amen he said in the 17th verse
[53:23] for the law was given by whoes
[53:27] Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus
[53:31] Christ amen you know the people can take
[53:34] the grace of God and they can begin to
[53:38] legalize and people can they can take
[53:42] the grace of God and try to bind you up
[53:45] and make Grace the law that's right and
[53:48] that's the problem so sometimes we look
[53:52] at amen the dos and don't and you can't
[53:55] do this and you can't do that you can't
[53:58] why this and you can't why that and you
[54:00] can't you know it ought to not be like
[54:03] that it it ought to be the grace of God
[54:07] Amen your uh your your fellowship and
[54:10] your communion with God Amen because God
[54:14] came to
[54:16] amen Grace and Truth came by Jesus
[54:19] Christ the law was given by Moses and
[54:21] the law bought by judgment it showed you
[54:24] what sin was amen
[54:27] the law made you conscious that amen
[54:29] there a sin and and the law brought
[54:33] judgment amen there was no law given to
[54:36] give
[54:38] life but if we take the grace of God and
[54:40] we use it a as a law then the people
[54:45] become in
[54:47] bondage are you with me now the gospel
[54:51] should not bring you in bondage but the
[54:54] gospel should set you free
[54:57] am yes
[54:59] amen the gopel you know he said thou
[55:02] shall not
[55:03] steal if you do
[55:06] steal
[55:08] amen then they had a right to do
[55:10] something with you amen amen amen if
[55:14] they caught the woman in the doter they
[55:16] can what stone her to
[55:19] death the Lord didn't have no Grace in
[55:21] it if you did it I F an eye and a what
[55:26] to for to are you with me so if you do
[55:30] it you going to pay for it but Grace
[55:33] came to
[55:35] say woman where are thy accusers amen
[55:39] amen she said I have none he
[55:41] said God forgive you see grace have some
[55:45] mercy in it amen Grace can look at you
[55:48] that you ought to die but I'm going to
[55:51] have mercy amen go ahead on don't go in
[55:55] sin no more amen you huh it set you free
[56:00] amen it freed that one so the gospel
[56:04] Jesus Christ didn't come to bind you up
[56:08] didn't come to make you do amen but it
[56:12] comes to liberate you amen it comes to
[56:15] set you free
[56:17] [Music]
[56:18] amen but some in our
[56:22] walk we feel like I got to to do this
[56:26] way I got to do this I got to do that
[56:30] Grace don't do
[56:31] that it does not bind you up it sets you
[56:37] free let me skip to my end and before I
[56:41] get in the
[56:45] middle and this is something that I had
[56:47] to deal with I if I would use a subtopic
[56:50] I would use he led captivity
[56:55] captive and Ephesian uh 4 I say grace
[56:58] and truth came by Jesus
[57:01] Christ now the people had to deal with
[57:03] that because they were all under the law
[57:06] and they all said we have Moses we have
[57:07] Abraham we have this they were all into
[57:10] that law but none of them could keep it
[57:12] that's right and there was no law to
[57:15] give life you know people have all the
[57:18] dos and don't you can't do this you
[57:20] can't do that yeah and they go crazy if
[57:23] somebody that's their Liberty
[57:27] that is their Liberty if they don't want
[57:29] to live right they don't want to do
[57:30] right that is their Liberty that's right
[57:34] they can either do it or not do it don't
[57:36] you jump on them maybe they don't have a
[57:40] revelation yet that's right are you with
[57:42] me amen oh yeah so what about you used
[57:46] to jump on people
[57:47] yeah I know
[57:50] it amen but sometime you grow up don't
[57:54] you this is all about
[57:56] love isn't that right you can repent at
[58:00] any time
[58:02] amen but I I I'm not backing up off the
[58:06] word the foundation of God's standard is
[58:09] sure and if the foundation be destroyed
[58:11] what can the righteous do
[58:14] amen the word is still the word amen and
[58:18] you though God gives you Grace don't use
[58:21] your grace uhuh to be a disgrace amen
[58:29] so I said I was going to skip to the end
[58:33] just in case I never get
[58:35] there okay so Ephesians
[58:40] 4 God is good
[58:42] amen I love him I I I I'm not going I'm
[58:45] I'm trying to share these things four
[58:48] and seven I I just skip because he says
[58:52] in the beginning of this verse I
[58:53] therefore the prison of the Lord beseech
[58:55] you that you walk worthy of the vocation
[58:57] where we he call amen so he he said Paul
[59:02] considered himself a
[59:04] prisoner and and and Isaiah said I come
[59:07] to set the
[59:10] prisoners I come to get the people out
[59:12] of prison that's right but Paul says I
[59:17] therefore the prisoner of the
[59:19] Lord see Paul amen God didn't make Paul
[59:24] a prison prisoner but he
[59:28] himself said I'm a prisoner amen see I I
[59:33] God does not make you a prisoner for him
[59:37] but when he saves you amen it's
[59:41] something that I
[59:43] choose that I want to be amen it's my
[59:48] choice amen the life that I now live is
[59:53] my choice amen and I'm glad to be a
[59:58] prisoner am because God has Set Me Free
[1:00:01] from something amen are you with me amen
[1:00:05] so here
[1:00:07] is let's the set the captive free to let
[1:00:12] those that were in prison out of
[1:00:14] prison
[1:00:16] amen so here it says in the sth
[1:00:20] verse he said but unto every one of us
[1:00:26] is given Grace according to the measure
[1:00:28] of the what gift of Christ gift God
[1:00:32] gift I
[1:00:34] said God gives each and every one of us
[1:00:37] his gift he said repent and be baptized
[1:00:40] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:00:42] remission of your sin and you shall
[1:00:44] receive what gift of the hly ghost the
[1:00:46] gift of the Holy Ghost the Bible said
[1:00:49] the gift the wages of sin is death but
[1:00:52] the what gift of God gift of God is what
[1:00:55] eternal life right but every one of us
[1:00:57] is given a
[1:00:59] measure of the gift of God God has given
[1:01:03] you and I each and every one of us a
[1:01:07] Measure of
[1:01:08] Faith now what you do with it is your
[1:01:11] business amen amen
[1:01:14] amen so
[1:01:20] here he says in the where I want to get
[1:01:24] wherefore he said when he ascended what
[1:01:27] on high on high he led what captivity
[1:01:31] captive you said what he talking about
[1:01:33] Led captivity one writer says probably
[1:01:36] is the
[1:01:37] forceful expression for the Christ
[1:01:44] Victory through his death over the
[1:01:48] Hostile powers of
[1:01:52] Darkness amen over the host the powers
[1:01:56] of Darkness he led
[1:01:59] captivity
[1:02:00] captive
[1:02:03] amen amen now when you deal with
[1:02:07] captivity what am I really implying what
[1:02:10] am I really talking
[1:02:12] about I was in I I was in
[1:02:16] captivity captivity usually deals with
[1:02:20] to be a prisoner of
[1:02:24] war to make a prisoner of
[1:02:27] war amen now we know that we were all in
[1:02:34] prison one way of another you are a
[1:02:38] prisoner amen and being in
[1:02:42] prison is not a good place to
[1:02:45] be because you
[1:02:48] bound when you in prison you be talking
[1:02:51] about somebody that's not free am you
[1:02:54] can't you're not free to do what you
[1:02:56] want to go where you want you're a
[1:02:59] prisoner so you're a dictator you're
[1:03:01] told what you can and can't
[1:03:04] do God come to free us from that amen
[1:03:08] being a
[1:03:09] prisoner and he led captivity
[1:03:13] captive
[1:03:14] amen so by the grace of God now when I
[1:03:18] when I when I when I look at
[1:03:21] captivity let's go to Romans 4 by the
[1:03:24] grace I mean ROM ROM
[1:03:27] 7 Romans
[1:03:34] 7 Romans 7 he says
[1:03:40] in 7 I'm I'm going to skip all the way
[1:03:43] down to
[1:03:44] 21 we know
[1:03:47] that he said but I know that in me that
[1:03:50] is in my flesh DW is no good thing isn't
[1:03:52] that right so we we don't look for us
[1:03:55] ourselves to be any
[1:03:57] good but we don't know that we were
[1:04:01] prisoners and we were in
[1:04:05] captivity and I'm going to show you uh
[1:04:07] you your prison in the Captivity that
[1:04:10] you and I were
[1:04:12] in because Jesus came to Pro Proclaim
[1:04:16] Liberty amen he come to get you out of
[1:04:19] the prison
[1:04:23] amen are you with me amen
[1:04:26] and if you don't know that you're a
[1:04:29] prisoner then I want you to recognize
[1:04:31] that you are a prisoner one way or
[1:04:34] another you are in prison amen amen but
[1:04:39] you must understand the prison that you
[1:04:42] in that there is a
[1:04:46] proclamation amen that you can be free
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:52] amen so here we are in 21 one he said I
[1:04:57] find then a law we're not under the
[1:05:01] law but under what gra Grace ain't that
[1:05:06] right but I find then a
[1:05:10] law amen that when I would do what good
[1:05:15] evil is present with me amen so he

[1:14:53] Lord
[1:14:55] I'm not trying to preach this morning I
[1:14:57] guess you figured that
[1:14:59] out so but he
[1:15:02] says Waring against the law of my mind
[1:15:05] and bringing me into captivity to the
[1:15:06] law of sin which is in my memers 24 oh
[1:15:10] Wretched Man that I am he said
[1:15:15] who body of this death but he said I
[1:15:18] think who God God through what Jesus
[1:15:22] Christ Our Lord see Jesus Christ gives
[1:15:26] us what so then with the mind I myself
[1:15:31] serve the law
[1:15:33] of God but with the
[1:15:37] what the law of what sin the law of sin
[1:15:41] this flesh it's going to serve
[1:15:44] sin are you with
[1:15:47] me but I don't want to serve sin because
[1:15:50] amen I don't want to serve sin I don't
[1:15:54] want to have excuse that all have sinned
[1:15:58] all have not not all is
[1:16:00] Sinners that's
[1:16:03] right
[1:16:05] all all have sin yeah yeah but all are
[1:16:09] not
[1:16:11] Sinners a sinner is expected to sin

[1:16:21] do wrong amen but when One Believes amen

[1:16:51] after the spirit for the law of the
[1:16:55] spirit of Life the law the spirit of
[1:16:58] life in Christ Jesus that's right has

[1:22:22] right amen hallelujah
[1:22:26] amen thank you
[1:22:28] Lord we make it so
[1:22:31] complex and the Bible so
[1:22:35] complicated it's all
[1:22:37] about this is a love letter to
[1:22:40] you the Bible is all about the love of
[1:22:44] God and how he's concerned enough about
[1:22:47] you and I to give his life for you and I
[1:22:51] and if you're making any complicated
[1:22:55] I don't know why you made it
[1:22:57] complicated I got other places to go but
[1:23:00] y'all know the works of the
[1:23:05] flesh what I was seeing is this
[1:23:10] flesh is a
[1:23:14] prison and the works of this
[1:23:17] flesh because this is a sinful
[1:23:21] flesh this was
[1:23:25] because of the fall of Adam and
[1:23:27] Eve and this flesh
[1:23:31] has so many things in it
[1:23:34] that it
[1:23:37] desires because it's a it came through
[1:23:40] disobedient that's right so this flesh
[1:23:43] would automatically kick in to
[1:23:46] disobedient to
[1:23:49] God this flesh is a prison
[1:23:55] but God came and led
[1:23:58] captivity you know I I'm just not
[1:24:01] talking about the physical body I'm
[1:24:03] talking about even the inward
[1:24:07] Parts because this outside is is a
[1:24:11] representation of the spiritual downfall
[1:24:14] and the adamic nature or the Fallen
[1:24:17] nature of
[1:24:18] man so it speaks of a fallen nature and
[1:24:22] the outside man begins to manifest the
[1:24:27] inside man amen amen if Christ is the
[1:24:30] Inside Man and he controls your life and
[1:24:33] the control tower and you begin to want
[1:24:36] to please him that's in you thank
[1:24:40] amen and if the others if the devil is
[1:24:44] there which is the fleshly you want to
[1:24:46] please your
[1:24:48] flesh are you with me so it's a walk
[1:24:52] continually going on in your members one
[1:24:55] you amen but he came to Proclaim Liberty
[1:24:58] that you don't no longer have to please
[1:25:01] yourself you can please
[1:25:04] God and notice even when you come to
[1:25:08] Christ and accept him and he comes in
[1:25:11] there's never a time when he amen brings
[1:25:14] you under the law where you can't do
[1:25:18] wrong well you can't do this or you
[1:25:21] can't do that or he brings you in if if
[1:25:24] you don't do this I'm g i I'mma burn
[1:25:28] you it ought to not come in your
[1:25:31] mind that he's going to burn you that's
[1:25:33] not what it's all about he said Christ
[1:25:36] came not to condemn the world to what to
[1:25:38] what save
[1:25:41] it Christ didn't come he come to save
[1:25:44] you that's right save you from who
[1:25:49] yourself amen
[1:25:51] amen to give you eternal life
[1:25:54] amen it's a but you say I don't know see
[1:25:58] the devil wants you to think that you in
[1:26:03] control you in control of your own life
[1:26:08] uh-uh it's EAS God or the devil amen and
[1:26:12] you cannot serve two masters amen you're
[1:26:15] not in control no matter what you how
[1:26:17] big and how bad or how much you think
[1:26:20] you in control you're not in control of
[1:26:22] your life amen amen true what got me is
[1:26:26] the little children I shouldn't have say
[1:26:28] it but let me say it anyway the little
[1:26:31] children said I I I I'm about 10 years
[1:26:35] old but I think I think I want to be a
[1:26:39] girl
[1:26:41] huh I think I want to be a
[1:26:44] girl and then here's a little young girl
[1:26:48] about 9 or 10 said I think I want to be
[1:26:50] a man and the parents say oh let them

[1:27:13] little child say I think I want to kill
[1:27:17] somebody I think I want to do this I
[1:27:19] think I want to do

[1:27:26] intelligent decision so you w't give
[1:27:28] them a call and say go on out there and
[1:27:32] drive because you don't trust them to be
[1:27:34] intelligent enough to know what to do
[1:27:37] what so you don't give them no driving
[1:27:40] license amen but you give
[1:27:44] them are you with me amen the power to
[1:27:48] make a decision that amen going to
[1:27:52] affect the rest of their life amen amen

[1:28:18] going tell you y'all children can be so

[1:28:23] areas but yet they're not matured in
