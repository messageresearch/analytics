and I reckon Lord we action for your leadership Lord we ask you for your spirit God direct us Lord and bless your people everywhere in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen you have your Bibles you turn with us to the Book of Psalms 63rd chapter of Psalms Psalms one one through five here David was pulling out his heart you see says Oh God die wrong my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsts for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry in thirsty land where no water is to see that power and our glory so as I have seen thee in this sanctuary because I love kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips may be seated father we thank you for the reading of your word tonight when you bless it in Jesus name Amen amen tonight I want to use for a little thought and I had two thoughts that with all our heart tonight and I was kind of between the two and I told sister Rachel if don't be surprised if I was the switch but she said there's no problem I can kind of handle it as I go along but it just was seeming to be pressing on me about the things that were in our heart tonight and I want to just go ahead and share this one let me see that power again let me see that power again and as I was reading this in I believers of my morning love thought after my devotion and it just seemed to ring in cause something to utter in my heart because there as I was listening I said listening and I was reading this him and I just was kind of imagining that David had something that was really pressing on his heart he had an urge to go to for God to do something in the sanctuary and David didn't take it lightly he highly extinct had on his heart because he began to say Lord early will I seek thee even and say that my soul first thing you know for thee and I thought about this you know as each and every one of us can probably imagine when your first thing for something nothing else can take that first place and I like it because David was thirsting not for materialistic things are not looking to get rich or to get famous but David was thirsting for God and I would just think I would say Lord through on what we have been dealing with in what has been transpiring in our lives I believe it it ought to stir something us something in us that will begin to do like they begin to seek God early because truly now that we realize that we need God more than anything and we talking about a thirsting after God I thought about in a bar where says that we just don't want the form Oh God but we want a living reality that God is real and I was just sharing you know at home talking to the family a little bit you know that sometimes and we hear so much you know about God but a lot of times that we're just talking about something that used to be in the history are what God used to do in the days of the Bible and that just become of a more of a form of God but I'm talking about are now living present is God somebody that knows what you going through and and know how to supply your every need that's the kind of God I'm talking about David had this thirst and six it says that he who hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled but they got to be a hunger in there they got to be a first and only you know sometimes we we don't understand what that hunger and thirst is really all about can we begin to go after materialistic things but those things can't feel that that void that that God gives you that you need me more than you need a job more than you need anything else what you are longing for is me but we feel that purse with Cornelis things and things of the world that never will be able to satisfy what the soul of calling for even in the natural even after all that you may accumulate all that you may have gained in this world nothing wrong with being successful nothing wrong we know that being blessed you know with things but destined will never satisfied what the soul need even in all of your cumulative you get riches off of you to get famous you still a find there's a void there's something in you that that God placed in you see in the book of Genesis is said that God he breathed into man become a living soul and that's so that God put in you is far the first after God and no matter what you try are to to do to do or make yourself satisfied you will never be able to do it until God coming there too many times we've tried over and over to use substitute to use money are to use a wife or to use a husband or to use something to get satisfaction and you realize that those things only last for a few days then in you realized something that you don't know what to do with yourself and you try so many things like so many people do there try alcohol I did try drugs but the more they drink or the more to use it still calls for more they never can reach that palace there that they say oh I'm good now then they begin to go from one type of drug to the next until they almost OD but the really thing that's what--that's law as you long in the fall is God and that's why God when he created you he created you the thirst after him the bottle say when there's a deep calling to the deep that got to be a deep to respond you have to realize that nothing on this earth or beneath the earth can ever satisfy this person that God put in you and I realize this in my personal life and all the things that I've tried and all the things that I've been looking to gain until God began to work on me and I realized that I didn't even know myself what I was looking for and maybe tonight you might be in that place you might be in the corner you might be in this a desert place in your life and you didn't ran out you don't know where that's the even tried debris to fill that void but I want to tell you tonight come to Jesus my riches won't do it being a professional athlete won't do it being a great man on the earth our great woman on the earth won't do it but when you give your life to Jesus oh he's all that I need everything else I've tried is all his vanity it's only temporal so many times and we see it and we try the pleading to beg but David here wanted to see God in the sanctuary now not so much a building that David was talking but it because so many times we always think that as long as God is in the building we'll real secure but the real sanctuary that God wants to come into is your personal life my pet scripture that I loved in the book of Romans could just say so much running 12:1 Paul said it like this I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies see that's the sanctuary that's where God walks to the whale and presential bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and next I said and be not conformed to this world see other work don't get into the trend of what the world is doing because you are presenting your body to God and as a living sacrifice holy see you can't do anything with your body because it doesn't belong to you God made that body so he can the well in it God wants your life to be a living testimony to the people around you but so many times we get conformed to the things of the world there was a little something in one of my little footnotes it says he about that conformed it said they are two resists being poured into the mode of their present thinking value system and conduct and the conduct of this world in other words God want to completely transform your mind in other words he want to let you know that you are not of this world are you in it but you are in another world you in heavenly places you've been bought with a price and you are not your own you can't do what you want to do because you are not in control of your life anymore when Jesus come in he's the captain he's the one that leads you not you lead God but David wanted to see the power of God oh my I was thinking you know about church and I like to use this a lot because and not meaning no harm but we have become so terrified and we have become so programmed to do how the church want to do things and to how our wanna do things and we forget about the leadership of the Holy Ghost what is the whole girls wanna read you to do something outside of your church affiliation what are you gonna do the NC C because man has has begin to try to take the place of the Holy Ghost but God our system is not for man but is for the leadership or the holy ghosts who lead the church though God uses man by his Spirit but that man in our relying on his own ability he's looking for the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's what the church is missing the thing of the week in what's the matter with Jesus and he brought a real well but I said and one thing that I heard they don't mind him being a Savior but they don't want him to be the ruler see they don't mind him being the good in order doing all the good things you know because God is good god bless see you got to keep you guard all this all but they don't want God to rule and God beginning tell you don't do this and God began to tell you don't do that and we don't want to listen to that but long as he just blessing me know he giving me all the good things and then I know God is good but let me tell you something even let the bad come he let the trials and the test of life come see when that come can you still say God is good anyhow when their income God don't change God send the rain God send the sunshine God send the storm God does it but he's still good you Nina Valley he's still real David must have known that something had left the site so very and I believe with all of our heart that something had left the church something had came in and it began to make the people cool they're beginning to get lukewarm the love of God begin to fade away because of so much other things that had come in and then move the Spirit of God out now you notice is that you have a free will you can resist it or you can accept it you are free moral agent and God put us on that wing and God lets you choose what is more important to you what do you value more than your soul does your job mean more than God to you be your wife do your children to your church means more than God to you see see God Wolf's first place not second but I wanna say seek ye first not suck and not third not food but first all we can follow the principle of seeking God first everything else of only place but we seek other things outside of what God said and then we wonder why are we in his shape we're in Shiga got a way of doing things and we got to follow the pattern one of the things you know that I realized that David so I like that I realize that God don't put a thirstiness will perish but so many times we we try to quit that thirst how laughter earlier with materialistic things in the bottle say that you know the care of this world with chalk the very life of thought out of you the more you gain the more you get the more you can see you can get but how much is enough in all you're getting where is guarding it in all of your achieve nothing wrong with having goals nothing wrong with having things in life but be sure God is at the top of the lists copy if he is at the top of the list everything else will be alright what has happened even our own country we are let ambitions we've let careers we'll let our own achievements take the very place of God oh yeah we still go to church and we're still saying we still preaching we still do all the things that are christen ought to do but it has to be more than that I believe it I believe it now is that we have done that long enough it must come to a place like David that their Lord I'm thirsting for you he had no other desire you know just the know guard and then no not just know him but know him in a personalized way I believe with all of my heart I thought about you know as the Bible said here in the book of Acts let me see that power Lord come on God has a power X 1 in 8 but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth see there is a power authority because God got the power but he gave us authority to use it so there is a fara T you know after you have been born again that God transformed to you and when that powered authorities come he said now you ought to be witnesses see God needs some real witnesses I mean our life once you have been born again and and your life has begin to transform me into the very image of God could you his son and you his daughter and if you his son and his daughter because we have his spirit then the very works he did you gonna do being a son in a daughter you know of God because it makes you beneficiaries of all that God has I mean all of the promises that that God made in the Bible he wants to give that to you that where you are not without any hope but you got venomous you got power you got a thority to use the word you know my family the other night I said there's new use a guard given us anymore and we won't use what we got giving us a lot but don't worry about you use what you got if it's just a little bit use that the problem sometimes we want more but we haven't yet he used what little we got I would say that we must start exercising our faith we must started using what he's giving us all what's the use having it a billion dollars in their bank and they're so well I don't have no money and I'm gonna sit and write they in their name and all they just won't go to the bank to get none of it but it belongs from what good is it then seeing God is looking you know at his people God in his hour has transferred a power and authority to the church and so many times we like to use their little quotation of Scripture that God was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ had he gave it to the church but I'll be using it time and now is there gonna be some people that's gonna really catch a revelation you know Oh what God wants done with his word and they're going about doing the father's business why because they understand that they have something I like another thing here you know also in the book of Acts the third chapter you know in reading in the book of Acts we saw how God started with the first church in Pinnacle's it was the first church that wasn't organized by man but it was something God told them in the New Testament they're going to Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high see before God knew that before they could really be or his witnesses they must first have an experience see you can't witness something you have an experience you can tell somebody what somebody else did and what somebody else said or what you read in the Bible but you haven't experienced it so God first you get an experience and then once you have an experience then you can be a witness why because the people will see that your life is testifying exactly what I spoke Sita you become the living reality of what the Bible is speaking about otherwise you just go in the church you're going through the forms of religion but without alive and experience that's why I'm so glad that God gives each and every one of us a personalized experience I can't rely on y'all you can't rely on mine but God knows how to visit each and every one of us I believe that's one of the greatest things that the church is missing in this hour is their personal experience with God and reason wants to say that because if you look at our lives you know Baba said you know the tree by the what about a fruit sit there come on Bill Sayle life that we are talking about as a as a christen if you've been truly born of his spirit then you should be like your daddy mmm because you can look at the DNA it meant that you have the same blood and so and it's the bloodline of Jesus in you then a very life I'll be there so many people are making the claims but they have no fruits x3 we're coming to a close let me see that power of gain Lord I believe you and I know for surely and I was thinking about this little epidemic and I was just telling some people are somewhere I've been saying you know there's no way that we can enter you know I serve God the same way as we used to I said because our life has been impacted by what happened some for a good and some for a bad but I believe as a Christian it should really are do something to our spiritual life it should bring us to a reality that we've got to have the living reality of God in our lives going the church has to be different because we understand that if God isn't with us we're in trouble here in the book of Acts three it was a time that disciples 3 and 1 9 Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour Priya being the ninth hour in a certain man lame from his mother womb was carried home he laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful - axe arms of them and enter into the temple who seen Peter and John about to go into the template Xing arm and Peter fasting his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give Rd in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength see Peter doze after they had day they Pentecostal experience and they were going to prayer services and their lawman that that came their dailies he had just started but he used to come there often but this time here are he fasting at Peter and Peter dholes you know they had something and they knew that what they had or it was the money they could put in this man a little bag but they had something that he won't have to bank no more he were the power that that Peter them had received in the upper room and when you know it's something about going in your parole when nobody else can come there but those that God Peter them knew that they had something you know when you have something and you see somebody got a need you want to help them but maybe not the way they wanted they helped Peter them say well silver and gold I don't have but such as I have give ID you know what Peter said I'm gonna give you something greater than money something now that you can go and work yourself Oh God gonna restore you see Peter if you remember this Pete in a you know old New Testament Peter was a man that had a lot of problems and and God told now Peter after you converted then you can screw so you sing a new Peter has to be it has to be a new Jeremiah our new brother Ernest C because that from my life we had was corruptible but see when that new life the Bible said in all things and then begin to be new you are new creation see you are no more the same why because something happened what happened a new life came in and when the new life came in the oil I've got to go I pray tonight that something was said it man that we can really get down to business and get the prayer and say Lord let me see that power in my sanctuary god bless you amen thank God for the power of God brother and sister we don't have the power the Bible said have not the Spirit of God he's none of his sous vided grace of God we got to have the Spirit of God he meant because that's what makes you an are sons and daughters of God amen because God has identified you by sending his power into your life and his Spirit is your DNA it's a it's your representation they meant that you have been accepted by God amen and God has accepted you amen in its kingdom amen so God has identified that you are my sons and daughters until you get the Spirit of God in you they meant that devil will amen do everything he can do to make you his servant his slave but amen you're not in slavery anymore in bondage anymore because any man be in Christ he's a new creature he's a new creation old things are passed away all things become new God wants to make him you God wants to make your whole God wants to give you a parity in power amen but you got to want it they meant God not gonna force himself on you Amen he said whosoever will let him come take up the water of life freely and he meant God wants you to have this power even God wants you to have his own character amen and God will it be identified in your life by his own characteristics amen so God wants to give you our get efficacious as I'll rinse the Palmer said he didn't know what he was looking for but God identified he meant I know what you need and God is identified by his own characteristics God when he comes into your life he shows you they meant who you are before the foundation of the world God showed you they meant the genes of a man of his thoughts he meant God showed you that you were attribute you were in the mind of God they meant and because you were in the mind of God the Lamb of God was slaying in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and because the lamb been slain he was slain for you and I well one day Jesus came and he walked around the shows of Galilee came in the flesh died on the cross shed his blood for what for you and I they meant Jesus did it amen but he said whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life God wants you to have eternal life in that eternal life you know I was sitting there listening to the preaching and and I thought about you know Sunday morning will you be accepted will you be accepted will God accept your sacrifice will God accept they meant you know I look at the world today the world is accepting anything anything goes just you name it claim it and do it you know it's acceptable the church has accepted anything the church had accepted the devil himself a man a preacher can get in the pulpit marry two and three times and amen ain't nothing wrong with it the church accepted hallelujah can preach good amen I know he's anointed I know he got the Spirit of God the Bible say the mission must be blamed as the husband of one wife in that right see the Word of God means little to people people accept anything outside of the word he said my people are destroyed because of lack of knowledge but the word is right here plain in plain view but the people I've gone a deacon must read a hundred or one wife but we had it doesn't make a difference people just disregard anything the Bible says and just do what their won't and it's accepted amen they say we're going to heaven wewe love the law the Lord the save me no doubt God saved him but praise God after he saved the people out of each if you round and he destroyed them for unbelief amen see God wants you to continue your Christian walk you don't want you to stop and still and build a golden calf in the wilderness and the people are washing they're gonna care Moses are known in the mountain too long let's worship the golden calf and no doubt that the whole Israel accepted the golden calf worship after all God has done for them but yet they accepted the golden calf and even Aaron Moses brother an anointed priests of God is building the golden calf like the people can worship and this this is your God the boat you're out of each of oh lord have mercy how blind could they be how long did folks be you said the God that God on the cross shattered his precious blood amen praise God yet we do him any kind of way yet we let another spirit another toss one not Allah Jesus come and take the place of the true and living God God is requiring holiness God is required amen you not to be conformed to this world but be transformed and save it along not just a grip on us because we've got satisfied with being lukewarm and cold and forth amen but the power of the Holy Ghost and the fire of God not in the people heart normal that meant they don't want to shout and dance in the spirit no more they don't want to crawl on Jesus - something happen breathless sister what's got ahold of people lives that they cannot serve God in the beauty of holiness what's wrong with holy what's wrong with being sanctified what's wrong with living for God brother and sister we ought to be humble enough the humble ourselves before they met God it's a God we need to get in line and get it let's get it stop with the word oh yes no we cry no we call human men to repentance amen well what would they do they say well I'm saying I'm a Christian I'm alright and then they feel like God needs them even even though they're not right with God that God need to help I'm gonna say God even is God he don't need our help it's up to us to be lined up with the word not to God except us amen outside of the word condition brother we got to clean up our lives we got to repent of our sins we got to get in line with the word we got the rule of holiness that way is a right way we got the line up with God brother sister let's get in the power God with the Holy Ghost stop all the foolishness get it right with God and do it now as our brother Bree Fred says get right to God didn't do it now amen dawn at the cross amen it's time
