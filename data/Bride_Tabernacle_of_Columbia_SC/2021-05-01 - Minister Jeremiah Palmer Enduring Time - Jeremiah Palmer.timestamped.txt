[27:21] [Music]
[27:30] first james one
[27:35] i mean you're glad to be in the house of
[27:36] the lord tonight amen
[27:54] start at the second verse down to the
[28:00] 12th
[28:02] my brethren counting all joy
[28:07] when you fall into a diver's temptations
[28:11] knowing this that the trying
[28:15] of your faith work is patience
[28:19] but let patience have her perfect work
[28:23] that you may be perfect an entire
[28:26] warning nothing if any of you like
[28:30] wisdom let him ask of god
[28:33] that give it to all men liberally
[28:37] in up braideth
[28:40] not and it shall be given
[28:44] but let him ask in faith nothing
[28:47] wavering
[28:49] for he that wavereth is like a wave of
[28:52] the sea
[28:53] driven with the wind and tossed
[28:57] let not that man think that he shall
[28:59] receive
[29:00] anything of the lord a double-minded man
[29:04] is unstable in all his ways
[29:07] let the brother low degree rejoice in
[29:10] that he is exalted
[29:12] but the rich in that he is made low
[29:17] because as the flower of the grass he
[29:20] shall pass away
[29:22] for the son is no sooner risen with
[29:25] their burning heat
[29:26] but it withered the grass and the flower
[29:29] thereof
[29:30] fallen in the grace of the fashion
[29:34] of it perished so also
[29:37] shall the rich man fade away in his way
[29:42] blessed is the man that endureth
[29:44] temptation
[29:46] but when he is tried he shall receive
[29:49] the crown of
[29:50] life which the lord had promised
[29:54] through them that love him let us pray
[29:58] father we thank you for your word
[30:00] tonight lord that we pray
[30:02] oh god for your spirit god sanctify it
[30:06] in jesus name amen may be seated
[30:16] i want us just for a few minutes tonight
[30:23] speak on this i remember sharing
[30:26] something
[30:27] like it but not in this aspect
[30:30] but
[30:34] and i entitled it enduring time
[30:38] our time of enduring
[30:46] we'll realize that
[30:49] now especially
[30:54] you know i'm understanding something
[30:58] that
[31:00] for every season god has a word
[31:09] and that word that god sends is
[31:12] to give the people uh
[31:17] another hope
[31:21] that what they are going through
[31:25] we realize that we are living in one of
[31:29] the most
[31:30] treacherous times ever
[31:34] somebody sing a song there never was a
[31:37] day
[31:38] like this day
[31:41] and it's a true song servant of god said
[31:46] one place that
[31:47] this last day of bride will take the
[31:50] worst beating of any
[31:54] why because she has so many things to
[31:57] contend with
[32:01] life in general
[32:05] who would ever thought
[32:09] who would ever imagine that
[32:12] what we are dealing with in this hour
[32:17] we would be here to go through this
[32:22] we had no idea
[32:26] what was going to take place but god did
[32:32] and i believe god always
[32:37] has something to come back
[32:42] the spirit that we are dealing with in
[32:45] his hour
[32:48] god never left himself without a witness
[32:53] he never leaves the people without
[32:58] some kind of hope
[33:02] i heard the servant of god say one time
[33:04] that
[33:05] there is nothing out of order
[33:10] everything is just the way god
[33:14] intended for it to be
[33:18] i know it seems difficult i i know
[33:22] it her i feel your infirmity i know what
[33:26] i'm dealing with and
[33:27] all of us there's no nobody at exempt
[33:31] has something that we're dealing with
[33:37] but what
[33:38] makes the problem is that we don't know
[33:41] how to handle it
[33:45] yes it catches us unaware it catches
[33:49] us by surprise sometimes it's very
[33:52] difficult it's very hard we wonder
[33:56] how are we going to make it but i want
[33:59] to tell you
[34:00] god has already made it for you
[34:06] the word endure as i looked at it and i
[34:10] said what a time
[34:14] it means to remain firm
[34:20] under suffering or misfortune
[34:25] to continue in the same state
[34:33] holding out in the face of opposition
[34:38] oh my
[34:41] holding out that's where it's at
[34:48] many are called by the field chosen
[34:54] the bible says one place that there's
[34:56] gonna be a great
[34:58] falling away
[35:01] you see the love of many gonna wax coal
[35:06] because the nicotine shall abound he
[35:09] said
[35:11] men's heart failing them for what they
[35:14] are seeing for
[35:16] what's going on on the earth the whole
[35:19] world
[35:20] is just shook up
[35:25] they wondering what can they do to
[35:28] make it better what
[35:31] can i do to overcome
[35:35] what i'm dealing with trust in the lord
[35:44] many
[35:47] have gotten to a place that they feel
[35:51] they'd rather just die
[35:57] that seemed to be the easy way out
[36:01] but that's just the beginning of a
[36:03] minute
[36:07] but to remain firm in other words
[36:12] ah the song said do our hell assail me
[36:16] i shall not be moved
[36:21] though the tempt is raging
[36:26] though everything around me seem to be
[36:29] going wow i shall not be moved
[36:37] what's holding you
[36:41] what's keeping you from not
[36:44] giving up
[36:48] someone say it's going to take a strong
[36:50] win in this it's gonna
[36:54] take more than just talking about
[36:58] how good god is and what god has done in
[37:02] time
[37:03] past i'm talking about a god right now
[37:08] [Music]
[37:12] so many people
[37:16] a song came to my mind so many people
[37:19] talk about me but i
[37:22] i'm holding on what are you holding on
[37:26] to
[37:28] you got to have an anchor in this hour
[37:32] you got to have something that even when
[37:35] you want to let go
[37:37] it'll hold you
[37:40] because in this flesh it gets weak
[37:44] it gets weary it gets sick
[37:49] and get tired
[37:52] but oh i'm so glad that the bible said
[37:55] that
[37:56] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[37:59] that
[37:59] the spirit of the lord will raise
[38:07] oh my
[38:10] we're gonna find out that nobody young
[38:13] or old
[38:13] you can't keep yourself
[38:19] that's why he sent the holy ghost to be
[38:21] a keeper
[38:24] he knew
[38:28] what we're going to have to be dealing
[38:29] with in this hour
[38:32] and god wanted to give us
[38:36] something that we can depend on
[38:41] sometimes we depend on our own
[38:44] physical script our knowledge and
[38:47] our ability but you'll find out
[38:50] it won't even stand
[39:00] i want to read something to you this is
[39:02] just a footnote
[39:03] [Music]
[39:08] i like the definition because it means
[39:12] remaining firm i saw something the other
[39:16] day and i thought about
[39:18] you know we have this
[39:22] thing uh nothing but they have this
[39:25] little singing
[39:28] you know to say what he's saying
[39:32] and i saw something and i said i wonder
[39:34] whether they saw this
[39:37] because he did say this but he said no
[39:41] matter who you are you are not exempt
[39:45] from being sick
[39:48] he said i am not even exempt
[39:54] no matter who what your title is you are
[39:57] not exempt from
[39:58] trouble
[40:02] he said even if you do get sick then god
[40:05] is a healer
[40:08] he said we are subject we're not immune
[40:12] from these things
[40:13] we're not exempt from what's going on
[40:16] but we are writing this thing together
[40:22] we realize and we understand that
[40:26] if god don't keep us
[40:32] lord i hope we can say thank you
[40:36] i got nothing to boss
[40:39] i'm not strong i'm not good no matter
[40:42] what your title is
[40:44] it's because of the grace of god
[40:48] if god moved his grace off you
[40:52] who be able to stand if god
[40:55] take the mercy but god knows how to do
[40:59] things i i
[41:00] i'm looking at this here so real because
[41:03] this is reality
[41:06] [Music]
[41:08] sometimes people under don't understand
[41:11] why why
[41:14] am i going through and why i'm dealing
[41:17] with this you got to go through it
[41:24] god have to allow he he does it
[41:29] why because god wants to prove you
[41:35] god wants to sometimes he know that
[41:38] something he want to build
[41:39] character he want to tell all of your
[41:44] self our righteous and yourself
[41:48] are script that you boasted about and
[41:50] show you that
[41:52] listen it's all about me
[41:57] it's not about how much you know about
[41:59] the message it's not about
[42:01] what you can quote but do you know him
[42:05] in other words do you really have a
[42:09] personal life experience with the god
[42:13] you serve and see you're going to need
[42:16] that
[42:18] you might hear mama you might hear the
[42:21] preacher
[42:22] you might hear brother branham but do
[42:24] you know
[42:25] him for yourself have you
[42:28] met god do you know him
[42:34] not about him see a lot of
[42:37] us know about him one of the great
[42:40] things around us
[42:41] we know a lot about the message but we
[42:44] forgot the
[42:45] author of the message
[42:49] which is jesus christ
[42:55] you know the man that he used but you
[42:58] don't know the man that god
[43:01] had used them with
[43:05] to remain firm in the face
[43:10] let me say it like this of your
[43:12] opposition
[43:15] every one of us are going to have an
[43:17] opposition
[43:21] every one of us are gonna see
[43:24] rather not you know faith
[43:28] on the mountain is good but how about
[43:32] when you get in the valley
[43:37] how about in a time when things get low
[43:42] and you can't see your way out
[43:48] you don't know how to get out
[43:52] can you still say god is good
[44:00] well yeah he good everything going good
[44:02] but if he's still
[44:04] good when things go wrong i want to tell
[44:08] you tonight
[44:09] he is still good when you're broke
[44:13] when you're sick when you're frustrated
[44:17] whatever it is god is still
[44:20] good he's not limited
[44:23] by your opposition
[44:28] i like that somebody said don't wait
[44:31] till the battle is over
[44:33] shout now huh
[44:36] how about let's shout in the midst of
[44:39] the storm see
[44:41] everybody can praise god when things go
[44:44] well
[44:45] oh my everybody can sing thunders
[44:48] everybody can
[44:49] praise god and everything but when
[44:51] things are going
[44:52] wrong can you still say hallelujah
[44:56] anyhow
[45:01] oh yes i'm learning something about to
[45:05] say
[45:06] you got to learn to encourage your own
[45:08] self
[45:11] don't wait for nobody else to encourage
[45:13] you
[45:14] you got to sing a song you got to find a
[45:17] praise you got to find
[45:19] something to be able to lift god up
[45:26] because god wants you to know that i am
[45:29] still good in the valley as i is on the
[45:32] mountain
[45:35] though you are going through trouble
[45:37] though you are going through a trial
[45:39] but god is still good
[45:45] let me read that little little footnote
[45:50] i thought it was good and i hope it
[45:54] he said trials
[45:59] i have a demeans through which
[46:02] god's blessing can come
[46:06] wow blessings and trials
[46:12] but we don't want to go through nothing
[46:16] we don't want to suffer
[46:19] we don't want nothing to happen to upset
[46:23] our plans
[46:26] but god allow it to go wrong
[46:31] see in the trial of what you're dealing
[46:35] with
[46:35] there's a blessing in it
[46:39] but when we lose that we start
[46:42] complaining
[46:44] and god hates that spirit
[46:48] did not the bible say in all things
[46:54] cry
[46:56] pout he said
[46:59] all things give what
[47:02] thanks
[47:05] [Music]
[47:09] give thanks in whatsoever
[47:13] is going on in your life why because
[47:17] god is working out something
[47:24] many people right here they they always
[47:28] asking for you know spiritual growth and
[47:32] in order to move on with god but when
[47:35] god
[47:36] begin to uh try him
[47:39] see before he can give you more you got
[47:42] to be proven that you can handle
[47:46] the next step or whatever it is that god
[47:49] has for you
[47:52] people say promotion comes from the lord
[47:56] and before god promotes you he let you
[47:59] go through something
[48:03] because our power without character
[48:06] and satanic
[48:09] we have to know how to conduct
[48:13] ourselves even in the midst of the fire
[48:21] enduring time
[48:26] abraham
[48:30] endured 25 years
[48:36] you could imagine what he had to deal
[48:37] with
[48:39] in his generation then even
[48:42] after god gave him the promise then god
[48:45] told him to go and take it up and
[48:46] sacrifice it
[48:51] my let me tell you something those
[48:55] old patriarchs what they had to
[48:58] deal with under the covenant of the law
[49:04] under a sacrifice of of animals they
[49:08] they held on
[49:13] they never really saw what we see
[49:18] yet their faith was able to
[49:21] take them through and they remain
[49:28] firm
[49:31] bible say abraham staggered not
[49:36] in other words abraham didn't let the
[49:39] opposition
[49:42] discourage him he didn't let his
[49:45] age he didn't let sarah
[49:48] age he didn't let what the people
[49:52] were saying discourage him
[49:56] abraham let not even serve his own wife
[50:02] but abraham believed in hope
[50:05] where there wasn't no hope see
[50:08] church you got to believe in hope
[50:12] where there isn't no hope it doesn't
[50:16] matter
[50:16] what they say it doesn't matter how
[50:20] it looks i'm gonna hold on to god in
[50:23] changing hands
[50:32] you know uh off the tower across that
[50:34] quote the servant of god said
[50:36] you know it's usually in the darkest
[50:38] hours
[50:40] when the supernatural takes place
[50:45] and i said lord wouldn't it be a good
[50:47] time for
[50:48] the supernatural breakout
[50:52] how wouldn't it be in darkness in in the
[50:55] most
[50:56] corruptible the most with everybody
[50:59] all you hate is negative negative
[51:02] negative name no matter where you go
[51:04] it's a negative negative
[51:07] we can't afford to get into the spirit
[51:09] of it
[51:11] we got to understand that the
[51:15] earth is the lord's
[51:18] see all belongs to
[51:22] him and he
[51:25] is the controller chief
[51:29] and the chief can let things happen
[51:32] without your permission
[51:36] he don't need the president he don't
[51:38] need the doctors
[51:40] no he is the commander in
[51:43] chief what do we do
[51:46] we said thank you lord
[51:50] i knew that song crazy
[51:55] i could tell you something
[51:58] some experiences
[52:03] god is always on time
[52:10] we always in a hurry
[52:14] but god is always on time brother
[52:18] god i'll let you get low
[52:22] and then god will bring you back up
[52:26] whatever god allows
[52:29] whatever god permits thank you lord
[52:33] i know that you know what you're doing
[52:38] and god is in
[52:45] or control reading it
[52:50] trials are however the means to which
[52:53] god's blessings can come
[52:57] one's endurance in
[53:02] in and victory over trials
[53:06] brings god's blessing
[53:09] christian therefore are not
[53:13] instructed to seek avenues
[53:17] of escape in other words don't look for
[53:21] your way out
[53:25] take guard avenue
[53:29] and god will work everything
[53:32] out don't try to run from your trials
[53:39] no don't stay in the house and say i no
[53:42] no no
[53:43] it's god doing something
[53:46] god has a blessing with your name on it
[53:50] sister patricia say
[53:53] how does it come through trials
[53:57] if you suffer with me you'll reign with
[54:01] me
[54:01] no suffering no reigning yes
[54:11] i know the devil is busy but i want to
[54:15] tell you god is busy too
[54:20] i say god is busy too god god is on the
[54:23] move church
[54:26] i know we we we don't see it uh in
[54:29] big conglomeration but god
[54:32] is still on the move
[54:36] he's still a miracle-working god
[54:41] he's a god that still provides
[54:50] okay christians therefore
[54:54] are not too instructed to seek avenues
[54:57] of escape
[54:59] god desires that they
[55:02] mature in this situation in other words
[55:06] grow up
[55:10] don't run from it
[55:13] god is wanna want you to spiritual
[55:16] mature he wants you to be
[55:19] overcomers or whatever you
[55:23] deal with fussing is not
[55:27] the answer
[55:30] you've got to learn how to let
[55:34] things go
[55:37] stop trying to handle
[55:40] god business
[55:44] we've got to grow up we can't remain
[55:48] babies all the time
[55:51] god is looking for a church
[55:54] that has spiritually grown and they
[55:58] know how to handle themselves
[56:03] how do you handle it by the word
[56:08] see god left specific instructions
[56:14] and these are some of the things that we
[56:16] are growing into
[56:20] i was doing a little a series like on
[56:23] the statue of a perfect man
[56:27] and that statue is to bring us all to
[56:30] the unity
[56:32] of other words mature a mature church
[56:38] a church that's not uh always disturbed
[56:42] and
[56:42] fussing and stewing about this
[56:45] and about that a church
[56:48] that is able to take something sometimes
[56:52] you take the wrong when you're right
[56:56] and that hurts because this flesh don't
[57:01] want to take
[57:01] nothing
[57:05] no i'm not going to take that
[57:09] but then look at jesus
[57:13] who is your example
[57:17] he took our
[57:20] penalty he
[57:24] took the slap he took
[57:29] the b he took them scripting him
[57:35] a man that did nothing
[57:38] someone said he could have called 10
[57:41] legion of angels
[57:42] to come to his rescue his rescue
[57:45] but he didn't say a mumbling word
[57:50] why who did he do it for
[57:54] what was the purpose
[57:57] it wasn't for his good it was for
[58:00] our good to let us know
[58:04] you may be spit on and talked about and
[58:07] beat
[58:08] on like even stephanie when he was being
[58:12] stoned to death
[58:14] you know stephanie said lord forgive him
[58:19] in the midst of being stoned he was
[58:23] still willing to say lord forgive them
[58:29] how about us tonight
[58:33] how about us when we do wrong or when we
[58:36] be wrong somebody
[58:37] can we still say lord forgive them
[58:42] can we still love them the same way
[58:46] before that happen you know how we get
[58:51] you know we get this self
[58:54] thing about us that we don't want to
[58:56] deal with people anymore but
[58:58] i started to tell you you're going to
[59:00] have to deal with somebody
[59:04] how are you going to spend eternity
[59:08] with people forever and we can't get
[59:11] along here
[59:15] it's shown that we must grow up
[59:20] we must learn that we all are different
[59:25] but guess what we got the same god we
[59:28] say we're serving
[59:30] and if you serving the same god and if
[59:32] you got the same spirit
[59:36] oh that's the problem
[59:39] do we really have that same spirit
[59:42] of christ that you can love in spite
[59:46] of
[59:49] no early funny feelings running down
[59:51] your back uh
[59:52] no funny feelings about this no no no no
[59:55] but love our servant of god says
[59:59] something he said you know
[1:00:00] he said uh you ought to be able to
[1:00:03] bitterly disagree with a person
[1:00:06] yet you can feel the same way about them
[1:00:08] before you had a disagreement
[1:00:13] that's going up
[1:00:16] will you let them take advantage of you
[1:00:20] why because the battle ain't yours
[1:00:24] god said i your battle
[1:00:28] he said if you hold your peace
[1:00:32] and let the lord fight your battle
[1:00:35] because the battle isn't yours
[1:00:38] i'm telling people i said you know when
[1:00:40] you going through things
[1:00:42] and uh around you and with people and
[1:00:45] dealing with issues
[1:00:46] you got to understand it's a bigger
[1:00:48] picture
[1:00:50] it's not about you
[1:00:53] see you got that's why you got to be in
[1:00:56] control
[1:00:59] of what you were dealing with you got
[1:01:00] wait a minute
[1:01:02] here is the devil and he's a good
[1:01:06] adversary he
[1:01:07] he does his job well
[1:01:12] but we have got to grow
[1:01:17] i'm going to close on this
[1:01:28] servant of god was talking about
[1:01:36] job
[1:01:38] you see the oldest book in the bible the
[1:01:40] patriarch job
[1:01:42] noted for his patience his endurance
[1:01:46] he that endures to the end
[1:01:49] shall be saved
[1:01:53] it's not how fast you run
[1:01:57] it's not how long you've been in the
[1:02:00] message
[1:02:02] but can you endure can you remain
[1:02:07] firm can you remain uh
[1:02:10] as you when you first got saved do you
[1:02:13] still have that
[1:02:18] joy
[1:02:20] i'm not just talking about sometimes
[1:02:22] when a revival comes
[1:02:24] i'm talking about joy down in your soul
[1:02:33] job noted for his endurance holding out
[1:02:38] in the face of opposition his neighbors
[1:02:41] coming around saying see you got some
[1:02:44] sickness
[1:02:46] some secret sinning
[1:02:50] joe said no i haven't i've confessed
[1:02:53] all my sins and made i've been offering
[1:02:56] i haven't sinned secretly
[1:02:59] oh yes you have you sin secretly
[1:03:03] but god was dealing with the saint there
[1:03:06] he said every son and daughter that
[1:03:10] coming to god must first be
[1:03:13] child raised spank the little
[1:03:20] let things go contrary you never have it
[1:03:23] all that cannot
[1:03:24] bear those things are illegitimate
[1:03:28] children
[1:03:31] and not the children of god if a man
[1:03:34] ever saw him in his heart knowing jesus
[1:03:37] raised for his justification
[1:03:39] except the same on the basis of the
[1:03:41] blood
[1:03:42] in the word put trials upon him
[1:03:46] nothing can separate you us
[1:03:49] from the love of god
[1:03:54] saying even on sunday i said you know if
[1:03:57] god before us
[1:04:01] then tell
[1:04:05] who can be against us
[1:04:10] if god is for us tonight
[1:04:17] tell me who can separate you from the
[1:04:21] love of god
[1:04:25] church tonight as we close we understand
[1:04:29] that
[1:04:30] we all have something to deal with
[1:04:37] we understand that we are our worst
[1:04:40] enemy we got
[1:04:45] i know we always blamed it on this and
[1:04:48] all
[1:04:48] that and all this and on that but
[1:04:52] you are your worst the enemy
[1:05:00] we've got to grow up and understand
[1:05:05] whatever god has for you is for you
[1:05:09] and god got a way to get you to it but
[1:05:11] you got to let
[1:05:12] god work it out
[1:05:16] stop fighting for yourself
[1:05:20] understand what the will of the lord is
[1:05:24] you're going to have trials
[1:05:27] but it's not the end of the world
[1:05:30] like i say weeping me endure
[1:05:34] for a night but joy cometh in the
[1:05:37] morning
[1:05:40] when is the morning then brother
[1:05:42] jeremiah
[1:05:45] when you can look up and understand
[1:05:48] where your help come from
[1:05:52] when is the morning when you can
[1:05:53] understand that
[1:05:55] lord whatever state i find myself
[1:05:58] i'm gonna be content
[1:06:02] we always want god to take us out of the
[1:06:05] fire but god will give you
[1:06:06] grace to go through it
[1:06:10] you take us out of everything we're
[1:06:12] going through you haven't learned a
[1:06:14] lesson here
[1:06:14] but we just stay there for a while
[1:06:18] it tears your character down it breaks
[1:06:22] things
[1:06:23] pride and it tears the flesh down
[1:06:30] god knows how to work it
[1:06:33] that's why nobody's going to be able to
[1:06:36] boast
[1:06:38] we are going to understand that that
[1:06:41] song said
[1:06:42] if it wasn't for the mercy
[1:06:45] of the good lord where would i be
[1:06:49] tonight
