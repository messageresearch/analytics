amen god's uh spoke on my redeemer liveth amen so by the grace of god we want to talk about the redeemer this morning knowing that he has redeemed you and i we've been brought back purchased by his blood 23 19 and 23. oh that my words were not written oh that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand [Music] at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroyed this body yet my flesh shall yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and my eyes shall be whole and not another though my reigns be consumed within me may god bless you word you may be seated praise god as we look at the book of job we understand that job had some troubles amen so the book of job tell us a man that is born of a woman full of trouble talking this morning but i know my redeemer liveth and my sub topic is the purpose of god the purpose of god god made you and i and i believe that we were wonderfully made god made us in his own image after his own likeness and when god made the world and his creation he said it was good but we understand when we spoke on life last week that sin got in sin caused death but this morning we said that in that sin has caused death the writer said we were sold to sin amen our sin had amen caused this whole body to decay in rotten man had lost that fellowship that he had with god sin had entered in brother and sister so there was a separation from god we lost that communion in that god his god and god had a plan god has a purpose and god has a plan and because god is god and he's omnipotent and he's on nice science and he knows everything he's all powerful the bible says he knows the end from the beginning they meant so god knew amen what was going to happen before it happens god has a purpose and god has a plan doesn't matter how dark things get god got a purpose and god has a plan in the book of romans 8 i'll just read one verse i think i went over that concerning life romans 8 sometimes we don't understand what god is doing and sometimes we lose hope sometimes we give up we don't understand as though life has dealt us a bad hand and we don't know how to uh conduct ourselves and we don't know amen how to go about everyday life because it gets kind of chaotic sometimes we're in a world that uh as it said in the last days perilous times dangerous times will come as we see this pandemic as we see amen the the protesters in the killings and even the shootings and all of that going on see man is not getting closer to god man it's getting farther away from god man is trying to come up with a solution to the chaos and the injustice that's going on in society man is trying to say we need justice amen but man does not understand what justice is because it's too much amen control amen by the enemy and if as long as satan exists there's going to be chaos and confusion as long as sin is in the world amen there's going to be every strife and jealousy and hatred amen we can't get rid of it doesn't matter what amen man do amen he can't get rid of prejudice and hatred and of violence and killings and modern you can't get rid of it because that's what sin caused amen sin calls all the chaos and all this the confusion and things that we're going through do we amen do we think that amen the democrats can come up with a solution or the republicans can come up with a solution do we believe that uh amen black lives matter can come up with a solution amen what can we do they meant to get rid of this chaos that we're going to brother and sister what is amen what is the answer to our problems what can we do what can you do listen will your vote matter get out and vote amen because your vote would make a difference let it get rid of all the demons and all the devils see man well they get rid of all the chaos and we go out amen let's not lie to ourselves they meant the problem does not come from without our problems is within amen amen it's in me that is in my flesh amen paul says dwell it no good thing been all watching in me amen yeah uh our what's in them is not those that without our what's enemy is ourselves until we can deal with sap amen i heard peter on the day of pentecost he said save your sap farm the son to war generation and i heard about apostle paul it said examine yourself and see whether or not you're in the faith amen i want you to examine amen i want you amen i want you to amen take a good look at yourself and see whether or not you are in the faith praise god examine amen let we think about it and examine sometimes we amen a doctor will take his medical tools and he examine the patient and see what the cause or the problems of whether we have certain conditions but examine yourself sometimes that word examine means that we need to test amen we need to test amen to see where we stand i'm going to give you an exam amen and and when you finish this exam i'm going to determine whether or not amen you know the information that the teacher has taught amen and god amen said search yourself examine yourself because there are many that think they're in the faith they think that they amen they in their minds they they think that they know god they think that they amen perhaps we know church and perhaps we imagine that we know him amen hey sometimes we presume to know god amen but i want you to examine yourself i don't want you to venture without authority amen for job said that i know my redeemer live you got to know you can't think you know you cannot imagine you know what you must experience amen god has a purpose god has a plan god has a purpose and a plan you might not know why me why do i have to go through so many trials in tribulation amen romans 8 here says here and 28 he says and we what and we what do we job said i know paul says and we know are you with me do we know amen i'll do see it's something about knowing amen once you know that you know that you know amen travel might arise you're gonna be tested and tried and see whether you really know amen but he said and we know that what do you really believe that hallelujah we're living in a chaotic world a world that is full of confusion you're living in the the pandemic situation and everything your world is turned upside down you can't go where you want to go you can't do what you want to do because we're under amen this uh uh this pandemic crisis amen and we can't just go about our normal amen but what is it brother sister how can we pass through this pandemic and still hold on to our faith amen some folks can't they may come to church like they used to come amen and we cannot express to our amen our feelings like we used to because we are under this pandemic crisis but amen and we know sometimes if we look at uh amen how we conduct our lives and how we journey through our lives and what amen we are doing right now sometimes we in the panic move sometimes we don't know how they meant to threat these treacherous waters so we do things that are out of the norm some folks uh amen and young folks have thrown up their hands and they've said forget about the pandemic amen you're cooking you're taking away my parties i can't drink like i used to drink and have fellowship with my friends like i used to so they said i'll take my chance in having a few moments of pleasure amen even if i had to experience the virus i'd rather go through that than than lose amen my joy amen because they don't have they meant the knowledge amen that i know my routine a praise god and some that's amen saying to themselves i know that i've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb that some of us amen they're not that don't seem to know how to navigate through these crisis when god is giving us amen uh our promise even though david said i walked through the violence in the shadows of death i heard god prophet said amen the life that we live will always in the shadows of death he said we're walking through the violence of the shadows of death he said now when we see the grey hair on our heads amen we know amen the death is lurking and we see amen this world amen and how amen the different things that affect life we know amen that death is lurking every time we see an automobile accident and somebody dying of some type of heart trouble high blood pressure we know that death is looking young people with diabetes and all kind of infirmities death is lurking but job said though the skin worth destroy this body amen i said though the skin worm destroy this body hallelujah the skin worms are working amen and death is working out amen and you got to realize amen the skin worms are amen and you amen the inside of you they made these skin worms amen and their death is working us but life is working in the amen the spirit of god they met the redeemer amen lives amen i'm not talking about amen somebody that's in heaven i'm talking about the redeemer lives within me i know that my redeemer lives amen it's not amen of fall of fetch are far off but i know my redeemer they met sometimes we were looking amen way off somewhere somewhere in heaven but joel wasn't looking that far they meant he knew amen that what i'm going through amen we're just losing his children and losing his cattle and losing everything he had and even amanda he was going through a test amen and that test that he was going through maybe sometimes he didn't fully understand what he was going through and some of us don't fully understand what life amen is taking what what journey that we're passing through amen but in that amen what he was going through his friends amen began to accuse him of a man of sin and everybody turned the backs his wife began to tell him don't want to curse your god and die amen she didn't locked away amen he looked and what he was going through he remembered job maintained his integrity he meant because what he was going through amen he knew that all things will work together to good are you with me he knew it'll work out all right amen i'm going to be all right amen the morning gonna come i'm in the shadows of death amen but though i walked david understood what it's like to know that his redeemer lived so he said though i walked through the violence of the shadows of death amen i'm not gonna be afraid of any evil brother and sister once you know amen i know they meant that my god live i know he lived praise god it wasn't uh amen when david was they meant being tested by the bear and tested by the lion david was able to face him and death in his face and amen and protect his sheep amen i want you to know david knew amen that i've experienced a man of god that's alive and i know he lives amen david said when he faith goliath amen i know my god live i don't care what goliath says i don't care what the big giant amen all is bragging all this talking amen i know my god is alive i don't care about my king he might be afraid amen i don't care about my brothers they might be scared but david was a little lad but he had an experience with god amen you got to have an experience with god and if you got an experience with god in that time to work out to your good but you got to have that bone again experience amen i want you to know uh peter denied him three times amen but what am i praise god on the day of pentecost he said i want you to tarry in the city of jerusalem i wait there till you be endured with power from on high i believe that when the day of pentecost was fully come they were with one accord in one place and southern that came aside from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house and oh god where they were setting and they appeared unto them clothes and tongues locked eyes of fire amen when the fire got ahold of john said i baptize you with water but there's one coming after me whose shoes i'm not worthy it's stupid not loose he's gonna baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire when the fire got ahold of him amen no more did he curse and swear that i don't know the man because he knew him that praise god hallelujah somebody said don't you slay me yet i'm gonna trust you amen i know amen that my god is alive they met they they met peter he met i am at this psalm crucified he saw him die he met him at the nail nails they put him in the tune they remember no longer had he stayed there amen he got up hallelujah he got up he got up out to grave on the third day he rose again amen and i heard amen to joel when he explained he said amen that i know my redeemer live and he said that one thing uh that at the latter day he meant somebody said he called us and i will answer that a lot of days i'm gonna stand upon the earth amen though the skin won't destroy this body yet in my flesh i shall see god whom my eyes shall behold and not another i'm going to stand amen i believe amen when they rose from the dead i believe the graves he meant the bible tell me the ones that slept in that in the graves when he got up out of the grave i believe that he job got up he said i know i i am all of god was over amen he got up and he stood there and when jesus resurrected they met the first fruits of the resurrection when he got up job got up amen he stood upon the earth amen and the bible said amen after his resurrection amen that those things they meant that it died in old times they walked around jerusalem amen i believe that he walked around jerusalem amen and i believe that job said this is the one it was worth my suffering it was worth what i went through amen i know he met my routine believe amen it's worth it all i had to go through something amen but i have to hold up i went through because i had an experience and that something had happened i know job had heard the voice of god i know god had dealt with his life he had something to hold on to he knew that he was serving the truth and the living god he just wasn't coming to church thinking that everything's gonna be all right i believe job had experience he had some experience amen i believe he knew god amen and it's something about when you know god amen you know he lives amen when you know god amen you know god got a plan i don't know what his plan is i don't know what his purpose is amen but if i got to go through the fire amen and then i heard a shot rocking me shot in a binding if i got to go there they may heat it up seven times harder i don't care how hot you ain't meant to put the furnace i'll go in there and i know my god that i serve he's able to deliver me they may praise god if he don't deliver me i'm still not going to bow i want you to know how many you give up when things get a little tough and things get a little rough how many you tore up your hand and you can't praise god amen because the pandemic got you where you can't say thank you thank you lord amen for the pandemic i'm gonna please you anyhow i'm gonna glorify you anyhow thank you lord somebody said i don't have but one hand i'ma raise that hand and let the devil know you're not gonna stop me for lifting my hand i'm gonna lift up my head and i'm gonna let the devil know i'ma praise god regardless of what i go through i'm gonna trust god i know amen my routine will live you can't make me doubt it i know too much about him i have come too far to turn around i'm not going back i don't care what you do hallelujah oh no no devil in hell amen can make me backslide amen i've come too far i've had a genuine experience with god i've tasted in that praise god from the good girl oh hallelujah oh yes i taste it and i'll see that the lord is good amen what uh who uh just separate us amen i'll tell you sometimes joseph had to go through some things joseph my he probably didn't understand they meant the whole plan of god they met but he did they met said i'm so next time i see my brothers because they've done me wrong i'm gonna kill them i'm not even gonna speak to them they meant somebody could have done you wrong and you could have said when i get my opportunity i know they're going to reap what they sow and i'm going to be a part of their reaping what they sow amen i want you to know but joseph could have helped things in his heart but joseph i know that god had a plan i wouldn't be where i am today amen if i didn't go through amen what amen i've been through they meant somebody can look at your life and said i wouldn't be here today if i didn't go through what i've been through amen i could have been amen in the prison somewhere and in the grave somewhere amen i wouldn't be sitting here today i wouldn't be hearing the word of god if lord didn't have mercy on me but i thank god that god got a purpose and god has a plan it may not look good sometimes but i'm not looking at what i see i'm looking to what i believe amen and i believe that i got a hope amen because he had a hope amen i said you got hope and hope makers are not ashamed because we got the love of god that shed it and brought in our hearts by the holy ghost it's because the holy ghost i'll keep you amen in the hour of temptation that's going to try the world amen because you're kept ain't the word of my patient i also will keep you in the hour of temptation i'm gonna keep your brother i'm gonna keep your sister amen god got a purpose and god got a plan the devil might attack you satan might have tried to take you out he tried to take your peace he tried to take your jaw he tried to take your life but god got a purpose hey hey god you weren't allowed if i get if you didn't have a purpose that you didn't have a plan but god i know that you got a purpose or you got a plan for me amen and i know it's gonna be all right amen i might have to go through the shadows of death but i live and not die amen i'll live and not die and because he lives i live also it's all right this morning god got a purpose god got a plan musicians can come god got a purpose god has a plan all you got to do is trust him they meant somebody gives up amen but i can't give up on him because he'll never give up on me hallelujah never forsake me how can i forsake him amen he's done too much for me amen i said god is too good to us god has a purpose god has a plan why don't you trust him this morning amen i know amen i said do you know have you experienced amen the indwelling power and oh god the resurrection power of god have the holy ghost come and give you that assurance that deep that called to the deep and experience that anchors your soul the experience amen i'll let nothing separate me from the love of god amen i'm not talking about the love of the church i'm not talking about the love of the preacher but the lord of god i know that his word is right and i know god amen knows what he's doing it is only for my good god is only making me what he wants me to be oh yes i may not understand it but i understand it's better behind by when the morning come something's going to happen that changes the way you think amen i know amen jova amen my me he couldn't understand the full uh ramifications amen of his tests but one day he meant something must have struck down in his spirit amen praise god maybe he stood up met and he said i know that my redeemer lived oh yes an inspiration struck the prophet joel and job began to speak he may pray that maybe he didn't even know what he was saying he meant but he said it by inspiration and amen it's in a book amen and written amen it's something that they may kept him going when the going got tough they meant then the tough got going amen when it got rough amen job said i'm still holding on i'm going to maintain my integrity amen praise god jeremiah had to go through and every child of god to have to go through uh you might have to go do something sometime he said many of the affliction of the righteous but the lord shall deliver them out of them all you go through he said that we've been may endure for a night but you're coming in the morning and he said amen praise god don't you slay me yet i'm gonna trust you i'm gonna go i'm gonna hold to god's unchanging hand god
