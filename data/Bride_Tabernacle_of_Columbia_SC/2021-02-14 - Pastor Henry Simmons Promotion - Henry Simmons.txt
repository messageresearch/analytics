amen 27 3 and 27. it says the prince the governors the captains the kings and councillors then gathered together saw these men upon whom bodies the fire had no power nor was and hair of their head stench sent neither were their clothes changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them then never can never speak and said blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who has sent his angels and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yield their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god therefore i make a decree that every people nations and language which speak anything amidst against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dumb heel because there is no other god that can deliver after the sword and then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the province of babylon let us bow father we thank you for the reading of your word we thank you

of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated we were we said on friday night we kind of gave some highlights on promotion we said perhaps on sunday morning we'll talk about being promoted amen sometimes uh promotion does not come from the east and the west promotion comes from the lord amen and um sometimes um many amen uh want to be promoted but god has a provided way in promoting us amen so god provided way in and that he promotes in his own way and sometimes we might not know the path that god is taking us on oftentimes we don't understand why we go through certain things he meant but god has a plan for each and every individual as i was listening to the prophet today and it was mentioned on the message rapture and he just talking about the god uh before the foundation of the world and before it ever was a world god knew you as sons and daughters of god god really recognized you in his mind before the foundation of the world amen he said if you ever were a son of god then you were a son of god amen in thought form in the mind of god you were there just as much as you were in your great grandfather but you did not know it just as much before you came forth out of your father you were sea germed there so you were an attribute a thought in the mind of god if you're a son and daughter of god now then you will attribute a thought in the mind of god you were a part of god then and if you were a part of god then you are part of god right now and as sons and daughters of god you must recognize who you are and your position and once you recognize who you are then you can conduct your lives amen as that uh slave that was uh conducting himself as a as a king amen and he was in even though he was in bondage she knew that his father over in africa was a king and he conducted his life as a king and i'm saying to you we must conduct our lives as though we know where we come from we know who our father is he's not over in africa but our father is in heaven amen and we must conduct our lives amen to represent him even in the midst of our trials in the midst of our tribulations and things that we go through our conduct must be that which will be coming as children of the king amen king jesus amen hallelujah our father which is in heaven amen always reflect amen amen because you know with your g's you know where you meant your bloodline you know your dna you know where you came from amen you're not ignorant amen praise god i jesus said i came from god and i go back to god and you must know where you came from and know where you're going amen there's no mistakes amen god knows what he's doing amen and we not might not know the way that god is taking us sometime amen but as a hemorrhage said we'll understand it better by by when the morning come amen so in in in um esther the sixth chapter and as we turn into the sixth chapter there caleb would read for me but um in the fifth chapter uh in the fifth chapter in the 14 verse it says then said zestra his wife and all his friend unto him let a gallows be made 50 cubes high and tomorrow speak doubt unto the king that mordecai may be hanged their own then go thou into the go thou merrily with the king until the banquet and the thing please hama amen he calls the gallow to be made amen see what haman had in mind he didn't know what god had in mind amen sometimes amen monica didn't uh know amen or the the devices in which the enemy was portraying and had imagined against him they meant maybe he probably seen them building the galax but had no idea it was for him but let's just see how god operates you know somebody said if god be false this would be a little teaching if god be false then what who can be against us is that right if god before you brother he said who can lay anything to the charge of gauntlet amen if god is for you don't don't be spending all your time worrying about what folks can do i'm not fear what man can do to me don't you fear what man can do nobody can stop your destiny but you yourself can hinder and delay amen god's plan for your life by your action and bible amen your thought pattern amen if you thinks amen the wrong kind of thoughts amen that god is not in control of your life amen that god is not in control over every situation amen and you know one song says accept what god allows if god allowed and accept it and just go ahead and thank you lord that because i know that what all things would work all things would work together to what amen to them that love to them who are the called amen amen if you call of god god is going to work no matter how uh how things may look how things may seem god will work things to your good are you with me according to his purpose amen god got a plan and a purpose amen y'all know the story hopefully of esther and monaco and so forth and how amen uh the jews were persecuted and uh especially monte carlo because he would not bow down to haman are you with me and you know as as a type and shadow amen because you will not bow down to the devil are you with me the devil would send all kind of devices and all kind of things amen because you would not bow down to the devil the devil would do every uh a thing and he'll show every trick and he imagined every kind of scheme and all kind of wows and all kind of tricks to trying to get you to bow down amen but you must be determined as i was praying and i thought i was going to speak on amen you know let your eyes be on the prize keep your eyes on the prize amen you must keep your eyes you cannot be distracted don't let things distract you from the prize you have a goal in mind amen and you got to keep your eyes on the prize because god amen you must realize in order for me to attain in order for me to win in order for me to have the victory i must keep my eyes on the prize okay so uh esther six and one uh you can begin reading caleb on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the king and it was written that mordecai had told of victhana and teresh two of the king's chamber of chamberlains the keepers of the of the door who sought to lay hand on the king of hatores and the king said what honor and dignity hath thou done to mordecai for this then said the king's servant that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him remember there's a gallop being made god is an old-time god amen uh just when you know the next day amen the wife done told him go make that gala and tell the king to hang in to kill him look what god had in mind brother and sister god always has a plan and something in mind for you in your troubled time in the time when you need him the most god is there and he's still in control he'll show up okay go ahead and the king said who is in the court now heyman was coming to the outer court of the king's house speaking to the king to hang mordecai okay see what see what i'm saying he coming to speak to the king to what hang him amen you know you know some of sometimes we don't think god is god god is god he's in control don't worry about your enemy god will take care of your enemy he'll even make your enemies your footstool are you with me go ahead on the gallows that he had prepared for him and the king's servant said unto him behold haman standeth in the court and the king said let him come in so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor now haman thought in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself and haman answered the king for the man who the king delighted to honor let the royal apparel be bart which the king uses to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon the crown royal which is set upon his head and let his apparel and his horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that they may raid the man with all whom the king delighteth to honor and bring him our horse back through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man who the king is delighted to honor then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horrors as thou has said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the king's gate let nothing fail of all that had spoken then took haman the apparel and the horse and the raid mordecai brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighted to honor yo you see what i'm saying god can turn situations i these things are just not written that amen see we can try to undertake maybe monica could try to fight his own battles with he with the loss but god can fight your battles for you amen praise god it doesn't matter what you're going through today god will fight your battles for you are you with me allow god to do those things in our lives i'm going to tell you promotion amen god will promote see he went back and he says that after shadrach meshach had been negotiated stood for god god let the king amen after all of that happen the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego are you with me i said the king promoted them don't y'all know we have a king that will promote you a king that would do better than amen the king in this case amen in esther case in medica mordecai's case amen in the case of nebuchadnezzar we have a king that's greater than that king if those kings can do what they did how about our king brother and sister let us trust in the king that will do right and oh lord praise god uh the book of genesis 41 killer genesis 41 praise god y'all know the story of joseph he went through a lot of things brother and sister i know sometimes we go through a lot of things in our lives and a lot of things we can look back in and and say well look well you know just look what what the lord has bought me and what he bought me through as many things you can look back and you can testify god you brought me through this and you brought me through that and you brought me through so many things and and because you bought me through these things lord i i'm grateful to you lord i thank you amen but you you cannot stop when god brings you through certain situations amen sometimes we get distorted we get bent out of proportion we started crying we start having a pity party we start complaining we start amen i don't have to take this i don't have to go through that ain't nobody gonna mess over me nobody gonna do this to me i might even fight i still got a little amen ghetto oh lord come on sometimes amen people are persecuting you on the job in school amen sometimes even family members and sometimes we're going to get in our flesh instead of staying in the spirit but you got to maintain your cool amen knowing that there's no temptation taking you but such is common to man that god with the temptation make a way for you to escape amen so god got an escape god got a plan he meant that you can come out of victoriously are you with me amen sometimes we give up before amen we are promoted we give up on god we stop trusting god you'll find so many people backslid they go back to the world so many people do all kinds of things when they feel like they're taken advantage of they're being treated wrong and they're being despised they're being rejected they're not amen being recognized amen sometimes people do things that i don't know amen but they only would take amen uh that god is in control over every situation they make that god has the power amen to set one up and to take one dime and if god set one up nobody can take him down if god amen takes down nobody can put him up what god bless no man can curse and what god cursed no man can bless are you with me it doesn't matter how what we think about it god is in control if we know that god is in control god no god has a plan now in genesis here oh i said 49 nope i'm talking about 41. maybe i just want to look at 41. 41 and 39 goodness i'm looking in the room and 39 41 and 39 i'll read it 41 39 and pharaoh said unto joseph for as much as god has chosen thee and shown thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as doll you know he told him to set a wise man over pharaoh had to dream and you know nobody can interpret the dream and joseph interpreted the dream and told him he should set a wise man over the prophet over the the during the fame and time and that man would amen know what to do amen because the dream interpretation told him what to do and pharaoh chose a man see after joseph done been sold into egypt after part of the wife lied on him he's in prison here joseph comes up out of the prison in the trophy to dream your gift will make room for you your gift that god has given you will make room for you praise god and nobody can take that when you're spiritual and god has given you amen true gifts nobody can take advantage of you and that's what that's what's the motto amen we had so many people that are so spiritual minded amen that makes so many bad decisions because they are so spiritual minded but take it back through the word that how spiritual people were promoted if you take it through the word you'll see whether or not you're filtering is it a thinking man filter are you filtering it through the word or you're taking it back through the urine through them and see where the lights flash over your decisions see sometimes we amen we don't take it back to the word and see what is stand before the word will amen in our own mind thinking that the decisions that we make the things that we are doing the things that we are saying amen it works because we get somebody that would stand with to somebody that was side with us somebody said you right you're right you're right amen but remember the story of real bone and jeroboam amen that solomon had done things that he shouldn't have done and amen so his son real born was taking charge of the kingdom and when real born was told amen by the elders amen don't do like your father did amen because what your father did it caused hardship on the people but instead of listening to the elders they listened to the young me he listened to the young people the young men and the young men amen called the kingdom to be divided and it was only two tribes that stayed amen with real born and ten tribes went with jeroboam the kingdom was divided amen the church amen that came out of the wilderness was greatly divided because why because the young people amen the young men gave the wrong advice amen when god promotes you you got to be able to make you make wise decisions take it back to the word as solomon had got off the word then the elders said let's get back on the word let's get back to what the words say amen so i want you to know amen there must be amen uh you must take everything back to the word if it goes through the word then it's all right but if it goes through the majority it don't mean it's right it's got to be amen the word that makes it right are you up man it doesn't matter how many people go along with what you say it's got to be the word if it don't go along with the word amen then let it leave it alone stand with the word no matter what the price it might cause your husband it might cause your wife it might cause your family it might cause your children it might cause your job it might cause amen whatever the price is going to cause you let it cost you amen because it will be better at the end of the road that you stood for the word and god will come in on time like he did for shadrach meshach and abednego he promoted them just like he did with uh mordecai amen when amen the the the goddess would build get ready to kill it god stepped in on time god will step in and he'll fight for you god will fight your battles for you if you trust him amen if you trust him and don't try to do it of your own accord let god fight for you okay he says thou shall be over the 40th verse he says thou shalt be over my house see what i'm saying the brothers didn't want him over him they were jealous of him because he was spiritual well here amen he couldn't have it amen you can't help when god bless you you can't help it amen people are you think you're more spiritual you think you're more holy you think you something amen it doesn't matter how how they rage and how they say all kind of negative things about you as individuals amen you think you're the bride you think you're the only chosen people what makes you you mean different from other christians what makes you different are you more holy amen you just fall in the word the word say repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen you continue to steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and the teaching of the pastors what makes you different because you want to do what the words say amen what makes you special amen because amen other people can do their own thing amen and they don't have to be baptized in jesus name they don't have to get the holy ghost but yet they can go to heaven amen brother and sister that's up to them amen but they might despise you and hate you because amen you know that you'll dress holy you to walk holy amen they don't have to do that and they say well we are children of god just like you that's all right you don't hate them you don't despise them let them go head on just walk the walk that god called you the wall are you at the end god will take care but you must arm yourself joseph because he had a revelation because god used him amen because of the revelation of jesus christ and because of the word of god amen god will take care of you brother but if you guard it amen don't mumble complain about your walk and about the way god takes you amen just about every day i come out here and i walk and i praise the lord for his goodness amen i pray and die in the gap amen for the congregation and i just you know just me praying and praying amen sometimes that might be in some indifferences somewhere in spirit and then walk amen but you pray for that person that amen that even inspires their own soul amen but they don't know amen what they are doing amen and jesus said father forgive them because they don't even know what they're doing amen instead of making spiritual advances they meant they're going backwards but you begin to stand in the gap god open their eyes and let them see amen god got a plan and a way and i trust before amen we get through amen we must understand what god how god promotes it might be a little longer this morning but amen teaching is always a little longer than preaching so y'all babble with me a little bit he says and thou shalt be over my house amen he trusted joseph because he recognized the gift was in joseph but did did the brother do that part of the prophet recognized him and put him over his house and but his wife had trouble amen haman hated mordecai are you with me you can't stop the haters you can't stop people it's what i i i you cannot please the haters haters going to be haters amen some of the young people haters going to be haters they're going to they going to always have negative stuff to say about you to think about you haters don't even know sometimes that amen the spirit that's in them just amen they don't need it amen because god is a god of what love god is a god of love amen we must love amen in spite of we must love amen and joseph ain't bad at the fact amen my brother's doing me wrong but i'm gonna do them right are you with me i've been done wrong and i know i've been doing wrong but watch me when i get my opportunity to get back i'm not going to get back i'm going to show them amen that i love them in spite of are you with me see when you get your opportunity to see there see there that just shows you brother amen praise god it's nothing about god in you when you can laugh i remember a situation when a brother had done me really really bad and i said i knew someday god will show who's right and who's wrong it took years and years you know what i fell for and when god brought to light that brother and showed his ministry in his life it brought tears to my eyes because i all i can look at is his children his wife and what they was going through at that time it was nothing to rejoice finally finally it comes to the light what who he was no i could not be happy i was sad i was sad because i could i knew it was a lot of pain that that family had to go through at that time are you with me a lot of hurt but brother and sister don't you know in time and process of time whatsoever you sow that show you up that's sure you reap it's coming up and you must understand that god amen you must not be happy or brother sister fall or backslash oh thank the lord i know there was no good all the time ah no that is not the attitude that's not the attitude we should have we should have lord i feel sorry for my brother lord if there's any kind of way you can help him help him lord lord they need help they need you nana i'm so glad the law brought him to life that's not our attitude i'm telling you it's easy to get like that and your your first impressions say well i got got him but it don't take but a second for conviction to drop in your heart because you got the spirit of god said i don't like that i don't like what you did amen and if you got the right spirit and you got the holy spirit in you he'll he'll bring you to in the subjection he'll check you are you with me i'm not saying sometimes we don't react the wrong way but the holy ghost would bring us back so that ain't right are you with me he says here thou shall be over my house and according to thy word shall all my people be rude see god will promote he says only in the throne will i be greater than thou amen here a rapid promotion after all the time and i'm telling you brother and sister the promotion that the bride is going to undertake it could be rapid very rapid at any day now there'll be a showdown and the bride will be promoted it's only if she's come to character she's been carried to build as she's shown itself to overcome certain trials and tribulations and things this is character built in time where god is molding us into his image and into his likeness so in character building time we must understand that when promotion time it could be instantaneously the bride has amen ready for the showdown and god was really amen putting the bride on this play and everything that the book of acts talked about and that that you know the third poor amen the double potion the book of acts ministry everything is rapidly because she's ready for it she's showing that amen uh that the power amen without character amen is satanic amen but with character you fit to rule amen that you know how to conduct your lives you know how amen that love has entered into a capstone perfect love has come to his climax you know you've got you've gone amen to everything that comes against you you just love love love amen you just forgive forgive forgive you come to that stage amen that when god want to amen kick in amen praise god we got to come this thing got to move quickly he said to judas what you do do quickly amen because i always come amen everything moving so rapidly you know we look at the white house and we look at the political scene everything is moving rapidly in in the place but you your ministry your life everything you move rapidly into the place amen all of a sudden the power of god strikes the bride as individuals not as a church not as a movement but as individuals the power of god striking the sea they meant all of a sudden she's stepping out in victory stepping out in authority stepping out in power amen as individuals not as a group but as individuals are you with me amen so individually god is more than you as an individual not as a collective body amen some will be left behind to go through the great tribulation period others amen a step out in power amen and as they near the oh to tell you she'll be saying come lord jesus amen god began to work so modern oh i believe that's what happened all of a sudden he's in prison now he's ruling are you with me let me just go to philippians here too philippians 2 god is good amen it's so much uh in what what god is saying to uh sometimes you get so stunned because i said lord it's just i pray i said god you know it's easy to get up and give a good message and give a good sermon but it's something to give something in season in time that god wants it to be said and i said lord i want to be right i said whatever i say i want you to say it i don't want my spirit to be in it i want your spirit to have the preeminence i don't want it to be something that i'm saying and i don't want to have nothing in me so clean me up lord sanctify me holy make sure that your word could be pure and he can come forth amen so he said the pure in heart shall see god are you with me so we got to have a pure heart amen we cannot have a amen a vein dick that type of way of doing things it's got to be from a pure heart god you're trying to take your people somewhere may they catch on amen you're trying to get them out of here to glory lord may we have a word in season that is needful for your bride that she can draw closer to you that's what i want so philippians 2 and 5 he says here let this mind be in you which is also in what in christ jesus see the bible says that we have the mind of christ isn't that right but he said let this mind be in you it must be a reminder that i want you to remember let this mind be what kind of mind would christ have brother and sister in our age and our day amen our action and what we're doing is it the mind of christ would christ think uh respond and react like we react in our everyday walk in our spiritual world let's reevaluate our steps re-evaluate our action let us take a close examination and say lord amen it's just the mind of christ it's just how you would conduct yourself or behave let this mind be in you that was also in christ who being in the what form of god thought it not what robbery to be equal with god he knew who he was amen he knew he was he was he know he was the word made flesh he knew that god was in him he knew his authority and his power and what he could do amen but he did not use it amen and rather this is what he did the bible says here but made himself a what made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a what servant and was made in the likeness of what men and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of a man he what he what and the quality that is missing in the the church and in the bride today is humility how do we look at our humility our humbling ourselves we must be able to humble ourselves before him and yes we we battle our flesh we battle our personal will and our desires we got to be humble amen and to do that sometimes we have to fight we have to pray we have to get breakthroughs we have to get closer to god in order to walk in humility are you with me he said humbled himself and became what obedience of death even what the death of the cross amen wherefore god has what holly what he promoted him but that's only when he was proven he he passed the test he qualified for promotion are you with me because he humbled himself when he said i could have called 12 legion of angels but instead amen he humbled himself the bible says amen to death even the death of the cross isn't that right he humming himself and wherefore god has highly exalted him and giving him a what a name you know to be called mrs jesus christ is a name that's been exhorted amen mrs jesus christ amen the bride amen which is his body his wife god exalts you and gives you his name amen the whole family in heaven and earth his name he gives you his name brother sister and to why that name wear it with dignity amen why the name of jesus christ the bride the lamb's wife amen white amen as one that conducts themselves with humility with understanding with wisdom being led and guided by the spirit of god with love amen that divine nature that love divine amen praise god perfect love okay he said in the 10th verse that at the name of jesus what you see what joseph brothers they they bow down before joke every nation about are you with me there'll come a time when every niche about and what of things in heaven and things in earth and at every and things under the earth and that every tongue shall what confess that what jesus christ is the lord to the word glory of god the father it's going to come on reckoning in time in my conclusion one i'll go another verse isaiah 14 isaiah 14. god is good amen i told y'all i'll be a little longer isaiah 14 isaiah 14 praise god in 12. the contrast into the humility of god and to promotion lucifer promotes himself he thinks more highly than the ulti thing he exalts himself are you with me sometimes we think we should be where we shouldn't be sometimes we want what god don't want amen lucifer has a a spirit if he can't get what he wants then he'll take it if you're not giving it to me i'll take it are you with me so i could have just you know just finished but i want you to know that there is a spirit a dominating spirit that if you don't give it to me i'm going to take it if you don't recognize me i'm gonna get my recognition because i deserve honor haman said uh monica i deserve honor and you polled to be bowing on to me and if you don't give it to me i'll make a gala for you are you with me so brother and sister sometimes amen part of her wifey because she was jealous because uh joseph would not do what she wanted him to do she had him thrown into prison she wanted him dead let's get rid of him and the devil amen knew that he he was defeated in heaven amen he come to take over the earth and jesus showed up when jesus showed up and amen he saw himself powerless he wanted to do everything he can do i'm going to get rid of this jesus are you with me but god saw fear amen to exalt jesus are you with me and i'm saying god is your god and he you are his sons and daughters and he'll take care of business look what lucifer said how thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning thou ha cut down to the ground lucifer and absalom had things in common lucifer and absent absalom david you know i can do a better job than king david i'm more beautiful than him amen in other words i'm a wiser than him so why is david being king i need to be the king are you with me so lucifer and his desire amen to take over heaven i you know why should i have it look how beautiful i am oh look i you know lucifer must have thought let me go over here and tell angels about it y'all listen to me y'all know god if i am god you know absolutely i'll promote y'all y'all know god's doing y'all wrong and i'll i'll give you you know a higher position than you got angels but god you know what i'm saying god knew uh i'm gonna tell you brother and sister god got it all he you know god you don't think god saw what lucifer was doing his eyes on the spiral he watches over he saw all that lucifer was doing but lucifer was able to convince a third of the stars of starting angels oh you look man if he could do that in heaven what about here on the earth that the devil if you allow him he'll come in and he'll try to convince you that wrong is right and right is wrong are you what man if it was apostle but the bible said he'll deceive the even the very late but for the shortness of days god made a shock don't you think this thing ain't close it's close brother it's very close sister he says how thou fall into the ground which did weaken the nation for thou has said in thy heart i will ascend to what heaven and i will what that's what i'm talking about the bible says wherefore god has highly exalted him not i exalt myself amen sometimes we think that this is what i supposed to do this is the way i supposed to be every move of god and everybody that's blessed of god to walk in the supernatural amen they don't count themselves worthy of it everybody that god uses don't even count themselves worthy no matter how good they can play an instrument no matter how well they can sing they just don't even see or ex lord i'm not worthy of it but when we hear i can do this better i am exhausted i suppose you know you're in the way brother you're in the waist system all of that eye amen all of that you think of yourself more highly than you are too amen none of us amen don't deserve god's goodness and god's grace amen that that's from the pulpit to the back door we're not worthy amen but god amen happens to do what he wants to do and we might as well say god i yield to you and i'm satisfied with what you do and in your own season and there's a plan and there's a purpose for my life god you will identify and you will do it are you with me so brother and sister don't ever let anybody say something different because god knows them that are his amen and god will take care amen but lucifer exalts himself amen oh i can preach better than i could teach and i'm going to tell you something i've seen people think that well i am the eighth messenger i am this you know i and they don't say it they like that but they think that what they're bringing is more important than what madaka foreboard are you with me and they think that their ministry is so special that everybody got to hear them if you don't hear them then you you know you don't have it you're not raptured material because i got it brother i said the holy ghost got it you got to be sure certain you got the holy ghost be certain that the power of god is inside of you and that god is leading you according to his word not according to some group or some man but according to his word are you with me and that leadership is with all humility not pointing you to a group but point you to the word amen not point you to their own personal private interpretation but point you to the word are you what man but god has already vindicated what he wants us to know for this day are you with me god has already proven himself amen and vindicated the word that he's provided for us for this day amen so nobody has to come and say amen i put that explanation mark on it god already did it from heaven are you with me so the word of god is right and god has given us what we need to get out of here are you with me god bless you let us stan god is good amen let us buy heads father the closer we get to you lord i know that more humbler will be the more inadequate we see ourselves god will begin to yield to your love your spirit there be more of you and less of us that's what we want lord this flesh to fade away oh god we want you to be in total control of our lives father lord sometimes we take control lord we take the will and we try to drive instead of lord letting you have the will hallelujah keep us in the lane keep us in the straight narrow way god lord sometimes we don't know the way you're taking us sometimes you take us through the violin through the shadows of death but will you lead lord our followers sometimes we don't understand why you do certain things god but certainly god you got a plan there's a purpose for my life god god you are i'm in your hands god and lord have i wanted about straight god bring me back to the straight narrow oh god that i might have the love that you had for me lord that i would understand your mercy your way of exalting lord oh god if we can just be humble enough get our attitudes and our ways and our thoughts out of the way and lord you might have the preeminence in our lives that's what we want that's what we desire god we want you to have control lord lord please lord take me
