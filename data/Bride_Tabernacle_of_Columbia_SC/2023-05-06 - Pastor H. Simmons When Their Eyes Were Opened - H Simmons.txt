of Jesus Christ Lord we commit ourselves into your hand for service have your will in your way in Jesus name we pray amen amen have your Bibles in turn with this to the book of Colossians first chapter Colossians Colossians 1 . it's like a better reading but I'm going to try to skip started in 19 verse 1 and 19. for it pleased the father there ain't him should all the fullest dwell having made peace through the blood of the cross by him to reconcile all things unto themselves to bring us back by him I say one of the day be things in Earth all things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind but okay it works yet now hath he reconciled skip down 25th wherefore I am made a minister according to a disposition of God which was given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory let us pray father thank you for your word for your blessing now in Jesus name amen be seated we were taking this back at the church at home in Sunday school and I've been for the last two months or so or better now we were working with Christ is the mystery of God revealed but then I don't want to work with a little bit from a different angle we've been putting out little little hidden things out of this message here tonight we won't work with Christ in you Christ in you and I'm really seeing the importance I don't know to me nothing else is so important for us to get the people to Jesus Christ and I'm not just talking about getting them to what has been spoken by the word of the Lord but actually getting them to a relationship that God has come in because remember this the Bible says Roman if you have not the spirit of Christ you are never his and God is coming back for a people like himself people that has been sold out [Music] people that not uh forcing them but willingly because they understand that without this life of God it'll be hard for you to live a Christian Life you may go to church and you're making rehearse and say what he's saying and they're like the same but they're actually they're produced their life of God within you see and I'd like to say this this is not a group type thing that well you know like they're doing now that this church think that they got it all or that church thing this is a individual Journey with you and God Alone and that's why we can't live off of nobody else experience you must know him for yourself even even [Music] I was telling this trip back home I said you know what like I don't want to leave this and I probably wanting to God tells me I feel led because I see that hearing colossian you're talking about Christ was the very image of God you hear the word he was the fullness or what God was looking to express he was God wanted to express himself as Father Son and Holy Ghost not three person but one person father above us God used Jesus with us in the Holy Ghost that he's sent back the same person in three different manifestations amen I'm seeing this we as we call ourselves the end time people or the message of the hour as we identify ourself but if that life of God is not being made manifest we haven't got there yet we heard and we know what are was said that we ought to be but it's something that God has to transform our life and this word that we receive we must become the word nothing less not just church members or or message titles it must be a manifestation of God living in his bride oh my my understanding clearly more and more why the server that God say that Revelation to a True Believer means more than what you think not just the revelation of the Thunders now just a revelation of the mighty conqueror but he said all revelation it's important to the True Believer why is it so important because he said that that's what the church is to be built upon [Music] the revelation of who he is and if you notice that when Peter answered him nobody else answered but Peter you know but he asked them who do you say I heard the son of man in not and Peter stood up and and he spoke by inspiration because the Revelation must be to you as an individual and after the inspirational stuff he said Peter Flesh and Blood did not reveal this and see this word that God has given us intellectualism and uh this um I don't know uh what they're calling on Revelation but without a manifestation you can't have Christ in you and there ain't no power there ain't no manifestation how can you where the word of the king is there's power huh sister and brother my life in your life must have the same manifestation look what the early church had and we supposed to be a duplicate not impersonate but we're supposed to be a duplicate in other words our continuation of the book of Acts the book of Acts continue because it was never an organizational denomination but it was a moving of the Holy Ghost oh do we really have it like they had it in the Bible and if we do then the world be all his miracles hmm is there an Obama when we get in why then he said my people are not saved why are they not convert it so God said well please I'm afraid that we're getting the people to the church but we're not getting them to Christ and I understand we can make people get it but there has to be something in US that can't settle for nothing else nothing less nothing short of what they had Weavers have and more yeah I'd like to say we don't need Pinnacles what Pinnacle is he talking about that that same experience they had that's what we got to have and then of course but never a denomination it was an experience that they had and we trying to bypass the experience and give the people something else less than experience with God it'll never work no this is not our substitutes brother sister we need a real thing oh yes sir nothing less no time now to act it that fake it till you make it that won't work no more [Music] we got to get desperate and said Lord here am I not my brother not my sister we not looking around to this or that it's me and God now if you ain't gone now is that the church down the road mistake but it's me it's it's you Christ and you the hope of glory expressing himself in a bride many member sometimes I believe we get it all because we uh you know because we go to certain churches and they feel they are they leak that don't work no God is only Elite [Music] it doesn't matter what church you remember of you better be a member of the real Church and that shirt you can't join that shirt you can't say well this is that no one body and who they had rice either head let me read this um 18. and he holy is the head of the body the church who is the beginning they're first born from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence that's what God wants to do that message he was saying that God had a free full purpose God wanted to reveal himself to the people God wanted to live in the people and have preeminence in other words God wants a church and he can lead by his spirit and not a people trying to lead God but God leading us we don't tell him what to do but he tell us what to do [Music] and wherever he leads you Lord I'll follow [Music] yes come back to the real headship Bible said they that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God [Music] Sergo is saying God hardest problem he had of doing is to get in the people they get the preeminence that God is is the one uh in control you're not in control of your life that you've been bought with a price and you can't Paul saying I am a prisoner you see God looking for prisoners one that can't do what they want one that don't think like they think you think like God because why you have the mind of God in the mind of God always in the word of God God mine don't lead you away from the word but he leads you to the word and what you and I doing is according to the word of the Lord did God said I am a well pleased about to get their people to submit I was scene of the Sunday total surrendering giving your life completely over to him and let him manage your life because I was saying that we as human we are self-destructed within ourself but sometimes I don't even know it that we killing our own self but God came to give us the right direction the whole purpose of this message God sent is to take us back and he was saying here that God will reconcile us God had a purpose you know on what all that is all down from Genesis all through he said God was expressing himself in Moses in Abraham in Jeremiah he was expressing himself but through Jesus Christ he wanted the fullness and that's why I'm glad it's our God is not looking for partiality girls are looking for part-time Christian but God looking for people that's going to be devoted to him and him alone people that are going to be led by his Spirit he went down to gonna know what they ought to do and it's our why because God speaks and they follow the leading of God he said my sheep know my voice you ought to know the voice of God the voice of God always have you to the word oh my God I don't know your mother Go and sing I don't know what you come to do but I'll come to do something he's looking for well you know when time pass how people do they always you know like to say I you know the terminologies we use and sometimes that's what it'd be be terminologies but we don't need this terminology we need realities of what God promised to do in his hour and you will the people that God wants to use don't look to Peter and those anymore no you are Ricky pistols we're supposed to be written not with ache but I'm a very life yeah he said I'm a very action or reflect him [Music] all of our action what we do how we live it ought to reflect Christ the biggest problem we have is people living Devil's standard lies professional one thing but not you know bringing forth any fruits but if that seed is correctly planted into the right ground it ought to bring forth fruits okay oh my look Romans you know pray for me I said Lord help us I realize in an hour and I tell it's romansly I believe it's the eighth chapter yes I was telling the truth I said there's no time now to play there's no time to act like we got something we don't have but I said we don't have it we should everybody get busy and get it it's an urgency that you must get it you must have the Holy Ghost [Music] there is nothing else that you you can't play around to learn the thing that was quoted to learn things when he said but he said uh the most greatest thing we need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] it's a urgent that we get the people back to the Holy Ghost because if the Holy Ghost says don't come and Lead You somebody else will lead you [Music] sometimes people want to pass the whole time to tell you what to do but the Holy Ghost want to tell you yes he leads you to it he leads you but you don't understand this I'm understanding this you can't lead those sheeps and sheets are humble sheep don't fight back sheets know they must be led and Jesus Christ is a bishop and a shepherd of our soul you see God who raises up man who's fully under the leadership of the Holy Ghost he's saying that man under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost is not so much here by this God in the man what is he doing and giving you instructions he's giving you the things that God is requiring of you because if you don't then the blood gonna be on his hand as I was thinking the other day for the siblings I was just thinking I said you know I always reflect back our only Christian walk and I remember way back in 1989 that had been first met with the Simmons came there and Brother Gibson Brother Isaiah different ones came and labored and I'll never forget and I can't even remember today as I look I see you know one of the important things that I saw that he always did and that wasn't trying to get the people to the Holy Ghost there were people flying high and jumping high jumping out the window jumping through the roofs about this and about that but he stayed right there you must be born again and I'm trying to say why he ain't preaching like everybody else why him preaching it deep you know things way up in heaven what for you need something on Earth and he was trying to settle the people into something that's going to take them in heaven and I saw over the years and I saw even in my life I saw the things that it was done and how God took us from one place to another but I I saw that he stayed with that same teaching you've got to have it same teaching you may know all the things that the servant of God said from 48 even the 65 but if you don't have that life experience with God in you and then you got a revelation of a word then you building your house from the top of God and you ain't got the bottom right and when that Foundation ain't right the top won't stand and that's what a lot why so many have gone back why because the foundation and Paul said I laid the phone got the bottom right you must have when there's holidays Foundation what are we building on and that's what a lot why so many what have he built the people off you could introduce when that why why are the people still struggling we're living our holy life the foundation what are we building on to live holy to live clean why do we build the people on but yet they've been around the message 15 18 20 years we're living a holy life something is wrong and see what's going on now when you grow up because you don't want no trouble with that Foundation is right upon a rock you start losing building upon a revelation of Jesus Foundation is right and you know where you're standing upon a rock you know where you at Romans 8 building upon the revelation but if Christ and you know where you're standing be in you notice you know where you're at Romans 8 if Christ beware 10 11 he said the body is what because of sin notice but the spirit of life because of righteousness see the body we've got to die because of sin but a spirit of life because that's the problem we don't want to die we got to die we want to do what I want that's the problem we don't want to die excuse me I had the same problem me marrying we want to do what that's why I hope when the people don't think coming to church is important as me I had the same problem with me marrying and they miss us is important lead you to church God lead you he'll lead you to church which is more important pick you up for work which is more important used to be overtime weird and allow that we wouldn't do that now and the Bible says sister now go back now people go back because the Lord ain't coming yet because the law didn't come in yet oh look like old things ain't right yet so things ain't right let's go back let's go back and let's work let's get well let's get wet let's get rich don't know what you ritualize the word the real remember the Bible said that everything was created by Him and for him everything was created by Him in foreign I'm sorry I can never get away from that you say seek ye first the kingdom of God I still believe that it ought to be first God wants to be first God ain't gonna accept nothing else but first place that don't mean that you not say it but it means that you got to come up I believe it's time for us to come up hither I'll be a member of the sermon he spoke along the way he said you know let's go on you man it's time to leave the principles of the doctors kind and leave teaching but we need meat this is the hour and we need something to come back the devil and if y'all see and I see it we know that the devil is Raging we know that oh my God angel in the land every time you look around somebody I said Lord how are we ever going to make it this doing what we're doing we got to have more every time you look around we got to do more about it come God is calling us to be okay we got to do more but I understand so ever will let God was in Christ God is calling Christ is in you that's what I'm saying one or two things I did through Christ Christ want to do it through the bride let's go up into Saint John as coaching God was in Christ what God did through Christ did something through the bride he just said come and sit around and say well Saint John I'm Godly no flesh and y'all know it uh to be the truth no he went by doing something Christ did something I always said God never called people so they come and sit around and say well if God call you there's something you must do know it uh to be the truth and there is something one of us God's give to do I always say God save you he called you for his purpose God call you there's something you must do and God want to get Glory out of your life one of us God give he wants you to be a lighthouse he saved you he called you for a lighthouse with power that house and if the right connection there he'll produce power you know before uh he said let him down below your connection to it life had to come and it's the right connection there it'll produce wild because God's spoken word when he speak them it must happen why because God's spoken word is the Original Seed when he speaks it must happen Saint John 14. let's go to 12 verse very very truly truly thank God I say unto you who is he talking to let's go to 12 first very very he didn't believeth on me I say the works that I do shall he do also where the works they need for what you do I do because he do because I go until my father see there was there are some works we ought to be in you let's go on over here down to the 18th I will not leave you confidence I will come to you I will not leave it yet for a little while in the world see with me no more a little while but you will see me see me no more because I live you shall live All Shall I live ye shall live also that day he said you should know that I am in the father that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you you will see him Highway music the world don't see him but we see him because he is within you what is he doing in you what is Christ doing in you battles in one place that these signs shall follow them oh yes please if God is in you the signs in the Wonders got to follow how can it not you have the Zoey life oh God I don't mean to go around this you know doing this no but God will lead you what we have is is is not some weak uh things that we just quoting but there's a very manifestation that God is looking for his bride to come into His image our word ought to be his words under the inspiration God will he'll tell you what to speak yes you have to wait for an angel to come down you got the commission of the word the word say if it is sick lay hands on the sick don't you know they were even doing that before the holy ghost game he told disciple one place he should go and cast out devils if they could do that before the Holy Ghost come how much more we ought to be doing with the Holy Ghost oh yeah there's one little working power honestly he gave him a name that's highly exhorted above every name you let that name every devil shrimple he's a day that named him the Lord depart from iniquity Jesus come with a life lived and you're walking circumspectly in the light of the word that God gave you we're not just talking about it but we say Lord let my life reflect what I believe would be the truth see these honest it is what God has given us oh my sir because if you want please say I believe he said we are living to below our Christian privileges he said we living to below it he said the church ought to be a million mile up the road [Music] but he said we're stumbling around fumbling around and fussing and this and doing everything else except what's God but intend for us to do Lord that will arise to the occasions [Music] they will do explore not them but the Holy Ghost in them we'll begin to lead them and if they'll begin to be moving such a way with God such a way when God you and people will be thinking what do they think they're doing no and it's not them but it's God in them because they gave up their life and they became a prison they don't want to do what they want in the morning we can't afford to them we want to make every step count now we know we're just going in vain or I'm going no they got to be if you don't have a real purpose why are you going to do we can't just go because we want to go we want to go because there's a leading to go there's a mouse said no go ahead if you don't have a real purpose why are you going way out of your plan see God don't want your plan we want to go because yeah no and I believe this every one of us must need to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost you must be led by God yourself I serve to God here he said Jesus said at that day he said that's this thing at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me are in you and you in me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day ye shall know that I am in the father are one I am in the Father the father is in me then when the Revelation come forth then it's I in you and you in me there you are see the manifold the threefold manifestation what for to bring it back we've got to be there as Jesus was the word of God he Vindicated the same if he wasn't the word he wouldn't have made manifest the word he has to be in some great Theologian that have been the real Messiah the world was looking for a see yes sir that would have been him that's what they're looking for today some great man God looking for the manifestation of his word he's looking for a people that's going to take hold quickening power the Bible said one place that the letter killeth we need the spirit we need the spirit to bring forth life and the people need that Spirit the life to come forth we need the Dynamics we need we got to have the power of God you can't live without it you said well the pastor got it that's him how about you you need your own power yes you need your own you need to know that the resurrection is in you I thought about speaking something in the church there after the resurrection what happened we know what happened but after the resurrection look at the early church no wonder you say now go to Jerusalem and he said wait there don't go don't go preach nowhere go there and wait till I sin you something and when he come when he come he said he'll testify of me and when it came at Pentecost Peter that line Peter that those people that was frightful when the Holy Ghost came power for more High brother did we in that house waiting waiting on what God Said wait sometime when you praying for something you move too fast wait wait till he come [Music] and when he came that day sister and brother they went out that house like drunk man there were no more cows they were willing to give their life for what they preach they went about the city turning it upside down everywhere they go something was happening why because they had something but until you get something going to happen but when you get something the devil know you even got it the problem with us we don't know what we got because sometimes I mean you have a lot you know you'd be wasteful but when you understand what you have you cherish it this word we have your is precious this is the thing that's going to cause us to get up out of here Jesus said if you will abide in me and by word of body you then you can ask what you will come on don't let these things slip us don't sit by and say oh that was good no Lord be it unto me according to your word God bless you [Applause] thank God for Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen praise God it's got to be not something not a saying not just a talk not just a good uh something to say but it's got to be real amen praise God as I said when the odds were opened they knew him amen when our eyes open amen we we know him amen to know him in the power of his resurrection and then the fellowship of his suffering amen so we thank God for the word tonight how many appreciate the word tonight just to let it it's just by our heads father in Jesus name God Lord we're in a dangerous hour Lord when the earth is quaking over in Japan and Lord it won't be long until that great earthquake hit California and Lord individual shaken in America father won't be long oh God when what's going on in Ukraine may hit the streets of America Lord where's the safe place Lord will we be built up where we have all enough Lord God to stand the storm Lord will God help us oh God to be quickened full us with the quickening power Lord happens to yield in such a way that your anointing can have preeminence what about you brother sister is Christ in you amen or do you want him in you praise God do you want the world or do you want Christ the Bible said love not the world but if you love God you want him in the inside you want to make sure probably God said be certain of God be certain do you have him if you
