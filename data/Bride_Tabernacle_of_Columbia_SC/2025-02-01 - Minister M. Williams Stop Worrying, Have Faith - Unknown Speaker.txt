18th chapter of the Book of Luke amen Luke 18 Luke 18 we'll start at the first verse read down to the 8th verse amen hallelujah how many love the Lord tonight amen amen this is the last day of the first month of the new year amen according to God Amen and uh we fought a lot of battles last year how many knows we are fighting people we still fighting battles this year amen um and one thing I've been telling the church back home is uh we have to have a certain type of Faith amen with the things that we seen and with the things that we're facing amen y'all keep brother blue in his health and Prayer by God's grace amen we know just saying some of them are listening online tonight amen but the time that we're living in amen it requires a certain amount of Faith amen and Jesus what he does through his word is he wants to make sure that we understand what we have have need of and those things can be provided for us amen let's just read it to you Luke 18:1 and it says he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always to pray amen and not to faint make that personal to yourself tonight amen amen and what he does he tells a story to to get this example across us uh saying there was in a city a judge this Jud was a bad man amen it said he feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she worry me y'all understand what he trying to say he ain't really care so much what was going on but it's like she was just so uh uh aggravating she just kept coming with a knee and coming with a knee and coming with a knee and he said you know what let me go and take care of this thing amen amen the sixth verse reads and the Lord said hear what the UN just judge saith apply this to yourself and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him how many are the elect of God tonight amen how many out elect the lady of Jesus Christ this church is called bride Tabernacle when you see elect amen put your name there amen am and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily amen nevertheless when the son of man cometh that's talking about the end time Saints nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen amen I just want to take a little simple title tonight of stop worrying have faith amen amen stop worrying have faith amen let's just pray together heavenly father in the Holy Name of Jesus Christ Lord we thank you for these few minutes in time set aside dear God where we look into your word Lord you reveal it to us Lord and we're strengthened by that lord lord lord we're not strengthened by our own mind by our own power Lord but lord it's by what you have done through the power of your blood Lord we thank you for that tonight we thank thank you for the saints that pressed their way out to the service tonight Lord Lord the ones that are listening in Father Lord our desire Lord is that we always leave this place different than how we came in Lord and Lord we know that wherever you are Lord things change Lord yolks are broken bonds are broken people are strengthened they are encouraged dear God lord lord it's not just a bunch of people gathering together Lord but Lord there is an anointing father Lord J and Lord May that anointing minister to the people tonight May that anointing Grant what we have need of Lord Lord we thank you for that in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ May the saints of God say Amen praise God you can be seated tonight y'all might have to turn me down just a little little bit amen my my wife be fussing at me cuz she say I blast people out sometimes I just got a live voice cuz I'm from the country amen hallelujah glory to God but I just want to deal uh for a few minutes about worrying amen thank you Lord uh uh worrying it's a disease we talk about natural diseases sometimes amen amen but sometimes natural diseases can actually come uh from diseases that we have within the Mind amen amen and it's not so much a a disease like a a broken leg or something uh but sometimes a spirit of worrying can set in amen amen and what worrying does it it slows down your walk Amen in your natural life it'll slow down your walk uh in your spiritual life and if you can't get worrying under control worrying will take you out amen amen thank you Jesus sometimes people are dealing with problem after problem and issue after issue amen and many of y'all tonight y'all might be dealing with four or five problems that I don't know anything about glory to God sometimes people dealing with money problems amen family problems health problems could be Church problems amen and what those things start to do is it starts to create a atmosphere worry amen people worrying about the economy amen cuz your grocery bill end up being $2 $300 when you go to the grocery store amen uh people worried about what Trump going to do amen cuz people nervous they even nervous at my job cuz Trump doing all kind of stuff cuz I work for the federal government but if we know who we are Anchored In And if we know what our foundation is built upon Jesus when he taught his people he taught us about a foundation if your foundation is built upon the right thing uh you don't have to let the devil run your mind in any type of Direction yes we are facing real problems yes we are facing real issues but there's a God that is on the throne and he is here to meet each and every need within your life glory to God we don't want to just be a people who had the victory when we come to church on Sunday morning and then when we leave and go out to work on Monday the devil is trying to beat us up with an uppercut what we have to do is the word that we have receiv within us that's the light a fire within you aen that you would get a strength just like how David did when he met Goliath he was much on his own but God anointed the tool that he had glory to God and he could beat down the enemy with it the 25th verse lordal mind of and in 62 he I sayto you for your what NE will he take care of you the 30th verse says wherefore if God grass of and every one of those Blades of GL of grass amen which is today is here and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith amen praise God sometimes we all have faith amen you couldn't have come out to church tonight except you have faith amen you could even get in your car and crank it up to come out amen except you have faith but sometimes our faith oh God is a little faith amen praise God Saints we living in a time period but we don't want to just have little faith amen but you going to need some big Faith am you going to need strong faith amen you going to need some faith that when the doctor is giving you bad report after bad report something Rises up within you GL to God and you know who your healer is and you know who your redeemer is ain't so much that sometimes we don't have no faith but sometimes our faith can be L up amen how do we strengthen our faith Paul tells us faith comes by hearing amen you got to come out to the service amen you got to hear what the word of God is saying to you you got to study your scripture amen you got to talk back to God we think it's some high and deep things but sometimes it's just as simple as coming out the church amen amen amen bless it's different levels of Faith amen the scripture tells us you can actually have a gift of faith amen we got a sister in our church she got a gift of faith and if you got a little bit of Doubt Within You by the time that sister start talking to you and dealing with that issue amen your faith get pretty strong amen cuz that's the gift of faith and sometimes we think our faith got to be so big the Lord said all you got to do is have it as a size of a mustard seed amen and you would think that would qualifies little faith but almighty God said that would be big Faith praise God Saints we living in a time period amen where the Bible says that it will be hard for people to have faith when we were reading in Luke 18 amen when it gets about to the eth verse he says nevertheless when the son of man come shall he find Faith amen amen amen amen he may be able to find nice churches he may be able to find good people amen he may be able to find great musicians but what the word of God is saying when he come when the son of man come y'all understand the son of man deals with the end time amen it deals with the word being made flesh again amen almighty God walking around in human flesh amen glory to God he's manifesting himself in your flesh and at that point in time when it gets down to the End Amen will he be able to find Faith amen praise God Amen the thing about Luke 18 amen it it it runs from Luke 17 and we very familiar with Luke 17 amen it deals with the son of man amen it it deals with the time period of the end amen amen in Luke 17 what happens is it starts to prophesy Jesus starts to prophesy and lets us know what will be going on at the end time amen he starts to talk about uh as it was in the days a lot amen praise God we very familiar with that today's a lot we know homosexuality was running rampants amen glory to God unless youve been living underneath a rock you know that homosexuality is running rampid amen then he said as it was in the days of of Noah amen as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man you can go back to the beginning of the Bible and it will show you exactly what was happening in the days of lot it will show you exactly what was happening in the days of Noah the scripture says in Genesis the 6th chapter and 11 verse that the Earth was corrupt before God and it was filled with violence now to me that sounds a lot like the time period that we're living in that the Earth was corrupt before God Amen and the Earth itself was filled with violence amen amen amen amen I was in the barber shop on Tuesday man it was talking about a shooting that happened on Far road and it sound like it was a family argument hope I don't know if y'all know him or don't know him amen but he was 50 years old and I said man to live 50 years on this Earth and to be killed by a family member over something that was probably a very simple argument but the Bible says that in the last days the Earth would be filled with violence amen Luke 17 talks about they were planting and building amen it was a a time of eating and drinking we see all those things amen if you want to order you some food right now and to be waiting on you when you get out of church they'll bring it to you amen don't matter if it's Pizza don't matter if you want to get something from the barbecue place they can bring it to you with door Dash amen according to God we see how they build a subdivision and when you think they can't squeeze no more houses in that subdivision cuz they put the houses right next to each other they make a whole new section and squeeze some more houses and the Bible says it would be a time of great building amen amen yes is telling you things about Luke 17 Luke 17 deals with Lot's wife amen and how when they was making their escape out of the city amen that she just something with finner that she just want to hold on to a few things of the world right at the time when they was making their escape amen and it became a great example so much that Jesus said remember Lot's wife amen I'm bringing you to this time period now GL to God Luke 17 it deals with it be two in the bed one taken and one left two in the field one taken and one left two on the job one taken and one left praise God and in the midst of all of this going on Amen Luke 17 starts to roll into Luke 18 that's right and Jesus is giv us all of these pictures of things that will be happening at the end time and right when you will start worrying he gives us a parable he gives us a story that will cause us to be able to strengthen our faith GL to God amen amen Saints if you got weak Faith the devil is going to manhandle you all type of ways glory to God Amen but there's something that you need to do and it's as simple as p r a y sometimes we think men out to always eat no that's not what the Bible says sometimes we think that men out to always a woman out to always fuss amen glory to God that's not what the Bible is talking about amen it says that men and when it say men in this case sisters he's talking about you as well the thing that you need to do you don't always need to be on Facebook you don't always need to be trying to find something to eat you don't always need to be ordering something from Amazon all the time hello somebody but you got to be able to always pray glory to God and not faint the reason why phrase it like that brother Ernest is because we're going to run into things saints that will make you want to faint Hallelujah GL to God but prayer is the key your faith is going to unlock the door amen praise God the time where you start to feel faint the time where problem on top of problem is piling up that is the time that you ought to always pray understanding that God is the pray of his [Applause] people in a time where the world want you to worry about this and worry about that they had a plane crash the other day and have you worried to get on the airplane right now amen but we don't have to worry about so much men out to always pray we talking to the Believers tonight you out to always pray amen sir and not faint amen amen amen yes Lord cuz at the end time it would be things that would make people want to faint amen the Lord said at the end time it will be even hard to find faith on the earth that's right amen nevertheless when a son of man come up can he find faith on the earth amen you know the reason why it's so hard to find faith is because this world is in a condition called lay of the sea amen and what Le de seia does is it it Waters everything down and it makes things lukewarm amen it makes things gentle and it causes people to be blind to spiritual things it causes people to be naked to spiritual things amen it causes people not to be able to purchase say I I give you gold amen glory to God so that you could purchase the right thing amen what happens Le the sea will beat the people up so badly that your faith amen the Lord said when I come back would I even be able to find faith to be able to believe in the Unseen thing in a different realm amen the substance of the things hoped for the evidence of the Things Not Seen will I be able to find Faith amen amen and Jesus said it's a simple as this he started to speak a parable amen and he said that there was a widow woman with a need amen we're not going to be all night and this widow woman amen she had a significant need she had a adversary how many know you got an adversary tonight amen and what happened it might have been a situation where the adversary got the best of her Hallelujah but what I like about her she knew who to go to she went to the judge amen she ain't go crying to her friends she a stop talking to her home girls she a startop talking to her home boys amen asking aunties and cousins and asking people on Facebook she went to the person who could get something done Saints when you get in trouble you better know who to go [Applause] to don't go to somebody that's going to give you some unsound advice amen you need to go to the judge amen am now the Lord using an example of saying that this judge that she had to deal with he was a unjust judge now that's almost a oxy Boron that's a fancy word amen it's the opposite how can somebody be a judge brother Simmons and be an unjust judge how you going to judge correctly as an unjust judge but what Jesus was trying to show us if the unjust judge amen this judge was a bad man he was so bad he ain't care what nobody else in the city said about him Bible say he didn't regard man he a care about man I'm the judge care about nothing he was so bad Saints he ain't even care about God Amen now I know a lot of bad people am and a lot of them still got a fear of God within their heart amen amen if they knew his word better they might well do better but that's our job a to bring the word to people this judge he was so bad amen he didn't fear man neither regarded God Amen but this Widow knew who to go to and she had a need and she went to him the first time and he didn't hear and she went to him again and he didn't didn't hear and she went again with her knee and again with her knee and again with her knee and a and it got to the point where he said oh my goodness this woman she might not got the money to pay me she might not have all the business and all but B this woman she's wearing me down amen amen she's wearing me out with what is going on in her life I don't care about God I don't care about man but what I want to do I need to get this woman off of my case woman I'm going to take care of your problem amen amen now Saints when I think about Jesus amen amen you know we taught amen praise God when we pray God can deliver you immediately amen amen and he operates like that how many seen him operate like that he operates immediately sometimes am amen but the Lord wanted to share a story about the power of being persistent in praise God the Lord want to share a story because sometimes we pray for things Saints amen and it don't move right then amen but the Lord said you know sometimes people would cast you down and say well you didn't have enough Faith to believe amen but the Lord says sometimes I want to see you be persistent GL to God there has to be something within the believer that causes you to be pers istent you can't do that on your own but the power of the Holy Ghost within you will make you be persistent God wants people that are persistent when you get knocked down you get back up again you pray for a situation and something might not happen but he wants you to show cuz he said when the son of man come can I find Faith sometimes Faith shows up amen after I wait it glory to God but there are some people sometimes we don't mind waiting praise God because we know who we waiting on we know that we waiting on a God that loves us hallelujah the book of Galatians the 5th chapter and the sixth verse I believe amen it says that Faith worketh by love glory to God that's a curious thing to say Amen to have faith working by love how can Faith work by love Faith Works by love because if I know that God loves me Hallelujah Oh Glory to God if I know that God loves me I know he's going to take care of me if I know that he loves me I can have faith in them hallelujah sister Tina don't got to worry about me coming home after work cuz she knows that I love her because I love her she can have faith in glory to God because God loves me amen I can have faith in him amen glory to God because I love him amen I can have faith in him glory to God I can even be like Jo job rose up his Testament was though he slay me yet will I trust him glory to God now that's a love and faith relationship even when things are not going good though he slve me Hallelujah yet will I trust amen [Music] amen amen amen amen hallelujah how many love the Lord tonight you can have faith in him amen because he loves you amen and because you love him you can have faith in him amen sometimes God don't always move when we want him to move amen sometimes it's a process of time amen praise God Amen but the scripture lets us know if a unjust judge man that ain't even fear God if he could do that for a widow woman imagine what the Lord Jesus Christ would do for you as an individual you got to make it personally man amen sometimes we look at brother uh Simmons and we look at brother Ernest and we look at Pastor Palmer back there and we think well it's all about the preacher you got to make the thing personal to you that God loves you that you are his elect amen the seventh verse says and shall not God avenge his own elect amen amen y'all know what the word elect mean elect mean that God picked you up specifically praise God might not have been nothing that man would have picked out about you but God runs his election differently and let me tell you tonight if God has elected you there's nothing that nobody else can do about it Hallelujah if you understand that you are the elect of God hold your head up don't look so sad all the time when you walk to your job throw your shoulders back good morning everybody it's good to be here this morning glory to God we had a good time in service on Sunday I'm an elected of God Amen I'm a bride of Jesus Christ he picked me out and chose me even though personally I was not worthy but he looked beyond something that he placed Within Me from before the foundation of the world and it doesn't matter what the devil tries to say against it I'm elected by God am amen amen when they had the election four years ago it didn't matter how bad they didn't want Biden to be in office he got elected to be in office when they just had the election the other day it don't matter how bad people didn't want Trump back in office he won the election and he's back in office what I'm trying to say is when it comes down to election well especially when it come down to God's election whatever he has chosen that is his judgment amen amen now Saints even though we the elect amen we trying to draw to a close God is going to avenge his own elect amen but he uses a curious turn he said which cry day and night unto him you know sometimes we think it's as simple as we pray and we going about our business yes it can be that simple but sometimes amen scripture says weeping may endure for a night amen praise God sometimes we do cry at night amen I'm not excluded from that uh sometimes we done cry all night and we get up in the morning time amen and and the issue is still with us in the daytime amen and the Lord is saying says don't think it unusual if if if sometimes you're fighting issues that linger what the Lord wants you to do is stop worrying and just have have faith in him amen amen amen amen he says sometimes it's day and night sometimes it seems like it's a long time amen praise God but nevertheless Amen in the next verse in the eighth verse he says I tell you even though it might seem like it's a long time amen praise God he says I tell you that he will avenge them speedily am now so sometimes it don't seem like speedily for me it's God speedily amen amen amen praise God Amen sometimes I'm still in the day and night amen sometimes I'm still in the long bear God says I'm judging it and taking care of it speedily Saints I just want to remind you that your timing and God's timing that's right are two different timings amen but nevertheless we not dealing with the unjust judge we're dealing with the righteous judge we're dealing with the holy judge and if he said that he is going to take care of it speedily it might not be Maurice Williams speedily amen amen I might say Lord you should have done it last year h two years ago but nevertheless if God is going to handle it amen he's going to handle iten if the unjust judge amen if he's willing to do that for a wiow woman how much more will Jesus Christ do something for his bride amen nevertheless when the son of man cometh amen the musicians y'all can come on up shall he find faith on the earth Jesus is asking a question praise God that when I come back glory to God Amen I see skyscrapers being built I see roads being built I I I see people with
