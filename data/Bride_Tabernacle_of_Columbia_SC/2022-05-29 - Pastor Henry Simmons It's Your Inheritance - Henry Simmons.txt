that father now mother 21. now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet locket thought one thing sell all that i have and distribute unto the poor and thou shall have treasures in heaven and come follow me 23. and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god 25. and they that heard it said who then can be saved 27. then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee 29. together who shall not receive money for more in this present time and in the world to come everlasting life god bless you you may be seated amen the young man says good master what must i do to inherit eternal life and i want to talk to you for a few moments we don't have much time but to talk with you for a few moments about your inheritance amen an ephesian warren would you know we play some emphasis there in ephesian one and your inheritance they meant inheritance is not what you labored and worked for inheritance is a gift that was provided to you from someone else amen sometimes the parents will labor to leave the children inheritance are you with me and somebody might you know leave you an inheritance and but i i think the greatest inheritance we want to talk about that greater your inheritance what you really have amen that god has given you inheritance and a young man knew that there's something that jesus could give him that he didn't have the bible said he was a rich and he was a ruler but he didn't have this what jesus had and he said i want it amen so he recognized that he was something that he didn't have that he wanted and that was eternal life i don't have that amen i got money in the bank amen i'm a ruler amen but i don't have eternal life and i want to know what must i do how about you brother sister friend do you want eternal life amen then the answer then to god this morning ought to be a question to god from you good lord what must i do i want to know what you want me to do that i personally might have eternal life oh god he just didn't talk about what much i can do to have more money in the bank or have a bigger house or have a better car amen have friends but i want eternal life and i want to know what i got to do to do get it what must i do to get it so he says here in ephesian it says 1 it says blessed be god the father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings uh in heavenly places in christ he said he already done that talking to us that saved the christians god has blessed you with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ this is what you have amen so he says according as he has choke oh are you with me i called him as he has what he's chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world you you just didn't get saved yesterday god saw you and he full knew you before the foundation of the world and god chose you he said you've not chosen me but i chose you and i've ordained you are you with me god had made you his choice you didn't choose god god chose you they meant the husband choose the wife not the wife choosing the husband are you with me so god chose you before the foundation of the world praise god he knew you was coming before you got here amen god chose you amen aren't you glad you were his choice he could have chose somebody else but he chose you your inheritance that we should be holy and without blame before him in what we got to be in love amen okay having predestinated us into the doctrine of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of it was his will it was him you are his will you oh god you're the reason he died praise god you're the reason he came to the earth you're the reason he was allowed them to spit on him and they lie on them and you want a reason amen hallelujah to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us what you have been accepted not because of what you've done but you've been accepted in the beloved the beloved son jesus amen said you are have been accepted in him it's not your sacrifice it's what he's done for you he has sacrificed himself as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world god had already provided i said amen he's already provided nico walker god provided a sacrifice himself a sacrifice and his sacrifice have been accepted oh god hallelujah oh god thank you jesus the sacrifice has held the sacrifice of his blood has been accepted cain's sacrifice wasn't accepted but he was was praise god in jesus have been accepted and you have been accepted in the beloved right okay god is good amen he said in whom we have redemption what we have redemption through his what through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his wife the young ruler he was rich but he didn't have that grace the riches of his grace he turned down the grace of god amen he turned down the grace of god even in the riches that god was going to give him if he would disobey if he was willing to accept what once i did amen what shall i do that i might inherit amen wherein he has abound towards us in all wisdom and prunes having made known to us the what the mystery of his will if you want to know why are you here why are you in the earth well you hear more than of being a nurse reminded me the doctor more than being a lawyer more than just being a school teacher you're here for a greater purpose for the will of god god had a purpose in saving you hey god god had a purpose in you coming to the earth hallelujah to the praise of his glory god's purpose this mystery must be revealed to you as an individual god must reveal himself amen to you amen it's a hidden mystery amen but the mystery of god must be revealed to you as an individual amen to god amen brought me in the earth for purpose amen and that purpose was the will of god it meant that i might be to the praise of his glory amen but we might shine his lights in a dark world a world amen that's full of amen violence and amen uh full of amen trouble amen but god called you to be a light praise god god called you to be amen a witness hallelujah god save you for a purpose yes lord hallelujah so glad he saved me i'm so glad he opened my eyes and revealed the mystery of his will to me thank you god you could have let me today amen oh hallelujah blind to the mystery of his will praise god but god had a mystery and a wig oh amen praise god others look at me and don't understand but the mystery has been revealed to me amen that i'm a son and i are you a daughter of god you belong to god god chose you well god that's why you can't be of this world praise god because god saw you in his mind amen you were in god before the foundation of the world as an attribute as a thought in the mind of god god saw you there amen you were gene seed of god praise god god knew you [Music] amen when you came forth in this world amen hallelujah god saw you he said tell me i think you're to be a prophet to the nation even when you're in your mother's womb i knew you and god knows you your inheritance brother your inherited sister hallelujah i'm glad that he knows you amen he knows my name hallelujah he knows your name and that's why he put it on the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world not when you got saved before the foundation of the world god placed your name there it was in the book praise god hallelujah and when god called you you saw your name praise god when god opened the word to you you say hey that's me it was for me your sound it was an uncertain time hallelujah thank god hallelujah according to his purpose amen the tenth verse says that in the dispersation of the food and there's a time he might gather together and warn all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom we have on in whom also we have attained it at what your inheritance you have attained an inheritance being what being predestinated according to what a purpose of him that worketh all things after the world you don't understand it but he worketh all things after the cancer of his own will that's why he said all things work together to what the good to them them that love the lord them that are the call caught into his purpose amen so you don't matter how bad it looks no matter how good it looks amen no matter how much we don't understand it's working till you're good praise god you want to throw up your hand and give up just to understand even god has a purpose god has a plan and it's going to work you may not see it and understand it right now but it'll work till you're good god got a purpose hallelujah work with all things amen praise god god is good amen according to the purpose of him that worketh all things that the cancer of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ and whom ye also trusted after ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that jesus what see after you believe not not when you believe but after you believe see god's going to do a work on you after you believe not when you believe amen thank god god saved him when you believe but after you believe god's going to do something else for you are you with me so look forward to something more than just believe it they may god save me amen i accept it and he saved me and i i believe that amen but paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believe amen i know you believe but have you received the holy ghost says you believe hallelujah are you up man amen that's the holy ghost promise amen you can oh lord thank god he says after ye believe you were sealed what with the holy spirit or what god promised to repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall that's what god said isn't that right acts 2 38 say you shall receive not you might he said you what you shall then if god is right and the bible is right somebody's wrong i know the bible's right somebody's wrong are you with me you can't get to help him with what a sweet house and a wife [Laughter] hey i know the bible is right and somebody wrong praise god bishop patterson amen thank god the bible is right amen somebody wrong y'all know the bible's right somebody wrong then okay now he says uh you would see it with the holy spirit of promise 14th verse which is the what of your what that's what i want our inheritance our inheritance we have an inherentness and and that's what we ought to you know embrace your inheritance embrace that god has reserved in heaven god got oh lord have mercy i'm so glad that god has given us an inheritance amen has sealed us with the holy spirit which we have as an inheritance amen until the redemption of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory amen god has given you when he gave you the holy ghost he gave you an earnest a down payment on what you should be expecting in the future praise god it's coming amen because god let you know by the holy ghost he's a witness that what he promised you you're going to have the rest of it hallelujah that's just a down payment but you're going to have the fullness of it amen the wit the redemption of your body your body is going to be changed amen this whole ethnic time or not going to pass away but god got a new body your body now in inflation time i said it's probably worth about 20 cent 50 cent might be worth a dime amen all you put the pot ashes and the chemical makeup of the body it ain't worth much but your soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds amen the soul amen that's what you they may we spend all our money for ten cent we you know spend all our money trying to dress up ten cents put a uh a 500 suit on and fifty dollar shoe a hundred dollar shoes on and think this over a ten cent body what's up no matter how how much you fix it up how much you spending on your hairdo how much you spent on this and that and ain't worth much but your soul is worth more than ten thousand words how much you spending on that praise god holy good master what must i do to what inherit eternal life that's what you ought to want eternal life more than we invest more in this world and what it means but we eternal life we devalue it the thing that we ought to value we devalue eternal life but eternal life is what i'm oh i'm living to live again amen hallelujah i mean i'm here knowing that i got a better place knowing that i got a new body knowing that i got a better home oh oh god it's good first peter 1 amen why are you turning there and when he lost with thomas adam when he lost his life he also lost in his inheritance out of need because they had complete supreme control over the earth that's what adam and else have he was a god of the earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he won't see but when he did when he sinned he lost his inheritance amen praise god thank be to jesus he lost it but jesus gave it back to us are you with me amen he was put out of the garden but here amen he told the man on the cross this day you'll be with me in paradise what is paradise is the garden of god are you with me i'm going to take you back to eden right back to what adam lost amen praise god hallelujah oh god isn't that god they meant to take us back and give us eternal life back to what we lost what adam lost jesus to restore he redeemed he paid the price that you can have it back maybe that's what some folks don't want what god
