[23:04] and thank you lord for this family lord
[23:09] lord we thank you o god for oh god a
[23:13] life well lived
[23:15] father we thank your god for
[23:19] what your word meant to our sister and
[23:21] what your word mean to us
[23:24] father we thank you lord today that

[23:53] now in jesus wonderful name we pray
[23:56] amen
[24:00] for just a moment we like to pause and
[24:04] thank god for mother tate amen
[24:09] we always
[24:14] she would always tell me
[24:18] i really really enjoyed that message
[24:21] and sometimes she would say i
[24:25] really needed that
[24:29] and um
[24:33] one thing about her before i could get
[24:36] some scriptures to finish
[24:39] she would finish it for me
[24:42] because there was something about the
[24:44] word that she had
[24:47] in the midst of all that she was going
[24:49] through
[24:50] she always had that word ankle in her
[24:53] heart
[24:55] that's why i can think about what david
[24:57] said thy word have i hid in my heart
[25:00] that i might not sin against thee the
[25:03] interest of that word giveth life
[25:06] so we thank god for amen
[25:09] the word of god that meant so much to
[25:11] her
[25:13] and i said to myself what shall i say
[25:16] today in just a few moments we
[25:20] want to read a scripture and we want to
[25:23] talk to you about hope
[25:26] where would we be without hope
[25:31] hoped in god
[25:34] praise god not only do i hope
[25:37] that's in god our hope of eternal life
[25:45] here first thessalonians
[25:49] 4 reads
[25:53] but i would not 13th verse but i would
[25:56] not have you
[25:58] to be ignorant brethren concerning them
[26:01] which
[26:02] are asleep that you saw or not
[26:05] even as others which have no hope
[26:10] see we suppose the sorrow if we have no
[26:13] hope
[26:17] it's a sad thing for a person to live in
[26:19] this world
[26:21] with no hope no purpose
[26:29] it says about hope
[26:33] hope is the favorable and confident
[26:37] expectation
[26:41] it has to do with the unseen
[26:44] and the future
[26:48] hope is described the happiness
[26:55] anticipation of good
[27:01] but when we talk about hope we're
[27:03] talking about hope of eternal life
[27:08] paul says in titus he said in hope
[27:12] of eternal life which god
[27:16] that cannot lie promised before the
[27:19] world began
[27:22] god promised eternal life
[27:25] before the world began
[27:29] amen and do you know that god
[27:33] amen knew before the world began
[27:36] that you and i would need hope
[27:42] the right of hebrews he said god willing
[27:45] more
[27:45] abundantly to show and to the ears of
[27:48] promised the immutability of his counsel
[27:52] he said because he could swear by no
[27:54] greater he swore
[27:55] by himself that through the immutability
[27:58] of his counts is unchanged in council
[28:01] which god who cannot lie promise
[28:05] god made a promise to you and i
[28:09] and of that hope amen he talks about
[28:13] amen the hope that we have as an ankle
[28:17] of the soul both sure and steadfast
[28:22] and which enter into that within the
[28:25] veil
[28:26] we have hope brother sister
[28:30] amen we have an ankle praise god we have
[28:34] a reason
[28:34] paul says if the dead rise not
[28:38] amen praise god then is our faith in
[28:42] vain
[28:44] amen but we know that one day amen there
[28:46] is
[28:47] a resurrection of the dead amen
[28:50] so he said sorrow not as those that have
[28:53] no hope
[28:55] amen but we know that a christian has
[28:58] something that they are anticipating
[29:03] amen they are expecting one day
[29:06] what a weird underexpectation of
[29:10] he says for if we believe that jesus
[29:13] died and rose again even so them also
[29:18] which sleep
[29:19] not dead them that sleep
[29:23] in jesus amen praise god
[29:27] those that sleep in jesus
[29:30] praise god we got to be in jesus
[29:34] we need to be in jesus somebody says i
[29:37] go to church somebody says
[29:40] amen i i'm a good member of the church
[29:42] but are you in jesus name
[29:46] amen if you hit jesus then the bible
[29:49] tells us by one spirit are we all
[29:51] baptized
[29:52] into one body amen it's whether we're in
[29:56] jesus
[29:58] i can't see a man having peace
[30:01] without a hope of eternal life
[30:04] amen a man amen amen he's in a uh
[30:08] chaos he's he's confused he don't know
[30:12] amen where he's going oh god i know he
[30:16] said one that starts falling
[30:18] out of this shame oh we don't want to be
[30:21] a wanting star
[30:22] we want to amen have an ankle
[30:26] we want to know where we stand know
[30:29] where we're going
[30:31] amen because we're on a journey and
[30:34] we're traveling somewhere
[30:36] and brother and sister we need hope
[30:39] to anchor our soul amen that's what gets
[30:43] us through our travel times
[30:45] oh god when we have trouble in the
[30:49] trials and textures and
[30:50] tribulation hope make us not ashamed
[30:54] amen because the holy ghost
[30:58] shattered abroad in our hearts when we
[31:00] got the holy ghost
[31:02] we got hope we got something to ankles
[31:07] oh god we got something in the inside
[31:10] hey man praise god god has positionally
[31:14] placed us
[31:15] in christ amen and when you're in christ
[31:19] you've got hope you've got jesus
[31:23] you've got hope amen if you don't have
[31:26] jesus
[31:27] amen you can have him today
[31:30] we need jesus
[31:35] he says
[31:40] with sleep amen
[31:43] it says for if we believe that jesus
[31:46] died and rose again
[31:49] even them that sleep in jesus will god
[31:51] bring with him
[31:52] for this we say unto you by the word of
[31:55] the lord
[31:57] that we which are alive and remain
[32:00] unto the coming of the lord
[32:04] shall not prevent we won't hinder
[32:08] what shall not prevent them which are
[32:10] sleep
[32:13] for the lord himself
[32:16] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[32:20] amen with
[32:24] a shout and with the voice of an
[32:26] archangel and with the trump of god
[32:29] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[32:34] then we which are alive and remain
[32:37] shall be caught up together with them in
[32:39] the cloud

[33:21] saved
