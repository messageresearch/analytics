ministry i just thank god for him in jesus christ's name amen we're not going to prolong the time he turn me to the book of uh first corinthians the 14th chapter and uh we're going to read first corinthians 14 and 10. amen praise god if you got us reads there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification let us pray heavenly father we just read a piece of thy word lord a scripture a verse oh god we take pray tonight and thought you just take it lord and just do with it as you see foot we thank you lord in jesus christ and thank for these people lord thank you lord for this fellowship we just pray you get the glory in jesus christ's name amen it made me be seated it may want to take a little thought from that hearing the voice of god and come back to the voice hearing the voice of god come back to the voice here are paul hill's ministering here to the corinthians letting him know that there are many voices inside the world and all these voices that you might hear all are mean something he's anonymous without signification i mean behind the voice is an intent and a meeting trying to express something to get you to either do something or say something to you to cause you to react to something so it's a voice amen praise god so we now talk about hearing the voice of god so only one voice you really need to hear and that's god's voice you need to hear the voice of god in order to hear god's voice you have to be able to recognize his voice and now a lot of people feel that they can't recognize the voice of god and we can finally show you that through the scriptures god has always spoken through his voice only few people have seen a form of god or or seen something that you can see it was god but nobody had really seen god moses didn't really see god moses saw the back parts of god but nobody really seen god everybody that god has dealt with they have only heard one thing his voice they heard the voice of god see whenever god is trying to get across to us we need to hear god's voice we're going to be able to discern and recognize where the voice of god is at see you've got to be to recognize the voice of god dessert is that the voice of god i'm here and we as christians we should be able to discern the voice of god jesus if my sheep will do what hear my voice that was him walking around in the physical realm he was on earth saying that but where is he at now his voice is still here on the earth god's voice is still here so we need to be able to recognize the voice of god and there are many voices in the world all these voices want to be heard oh hallelujah you got the political voice that voice is out there strong in the world are they trying to persuade people over this way trying to persuade you over that way it's a political voice it's a voice and it got a meeting behind it it's trying to accomplish something you're trying to bring something to pass it man but that's not the voice god wants you to hear god don't want you to pay no attention to this political voice your political father you can do nothing for you but take you down away from god don't pay no attention as a political voice it's not in it for a christian amen they ain't the voice that god wants you to hear god wants you to hear his voice hear the voice of god it may not only hear the voice of god but once you have heard the voice of god don't turn away from the voice of god it means come back to the voice it was crying out in me by the grace of god come back to the voice of god see we listen to too many voices and these voices are trying to take you astray you got the church voice people listen to the church boy what my church say that ain't the voice god i want you to listen to god i want you to hear his voice god voices the church voices two different voices amen go to the church always ain't saying what god is saying so god i want you to hear what his voice is saying and any man's voice is his word hallelujah god's voice is his word so when god speaks you got to be able to discern a man the voice of god a lot of people can't discern the voice of god because when they said a voice their faith that's a man ain't none of the man who i ain't paying attention to him you're a man nor the man that's the voice of god in a man god voice is out of mind that what god always is done he never changes his program we don't see a god we want to say well i want to see god and i want to see you know you can hear his voice he's going to speak to you in a voice now you got to be able to discern that voice and act on what's being said you know a lot of people feel that we're feeling this out there but god said come back to the voyager you've left the voice you listen to all these other voices you know the voice that got you doing all kind of thing that's contrary to the word of god little children listen to the wrong voice middle-ear people listen to the wrong voice quit listening to these false voices and come back to the voice of god i think come back to the voice come back to the voice of god that's the voice that has life in it they got life in it for you come back to the boy but you got to be discerned the voice now see don't think of the man speaking you got to be discerned whether it's god or the man speaking i believe god's speaking hallelujah i believe god is speaking well i could have called in your way back to the word calling you back to the voice hallelujah you've been crying out in me now come on back to the vlog we've gotten away from the voice of god we will listen to too many voices the other voice trying to get you to do things that contrary to the word this voice over here saying this right here another voice over here telling you this right here and all these other voices i'll take you away from god's word tell you all we got to go to church tonight we can just do something man we ain't nothing going on tonight anyway we have a little bit of prayer and um and that somebody just we didn't hear him speak anyway quit listening to their false voices see the involvement tell you not to come to church before the tale that you ain't got to do that you ain't gonna do that those are false voices trying to get you out of the will of god trying to get you away from the word of god but god's voice when it speaks it only encourages you to get closer to god encourage you a man to get oh my god to do the things of god that's god that's how you know it's god's voice you don't speak according to god's word ain't god voice amen so we want to hear and be able to discern the voice of god amen we hear voices now god void everybody got to discern god's voice now for god to put his voice on please and if you don't recognize it that was god speaking to you you didn't even know it was god god voiced inside your parents i said god voices are your parents god put his voice inside our parents to lead us and guide us and they ain't even got to be christian parents god's voices don't speak to them to tell you the right thing see but you got to be discerned that voice whether it's the voice of god speaking hallelujah ever trying to keep you in the right way and to keep you in the right path that's the voice of god see don't miss god's voice don't look at the veil look and listen to the voice listen to the words that's being spoken either god's word is the devil's word i believe it's god's word i believe god is speaking hallelujah trying to get people to come back to the voice so god has always dealt through a voice that we said very few people have seen god paul saw a light within that light he heard a voice the boy spoke to him saying saul saul why persecutors about me it was hard for me to kick against the pricks he heard the voice and he recognized that was god he hadn't had the voice of the church for so long but god had to come and interrupt that voice amen to show him that the voice he was listening to was not the voice of god oh hallelujah it looked like it was the voice of god but it wasn't it was the church voice leading him to do something contrary to the will of god but god came he saw the light but most importantly he heard the voice he heard the voice of god and he reacted to it he reacted to the voice and it changed his life because he recognized that it wasn't man speaking it was god speaking see then when he got to recognize he discerned the voice now because god is always speaking he's always speaking see the bible say wisdom out her voice cries out on the streets of the city only when a wizard can discern the voice of god see you got to be discerning the voice now god voice god has always dealt with uh with man through his voice you're not gonna see something that you can physically put your eye on he showed moses a burning bush but moses still heard what the boys the voice called on him moses mother you heard the voice he had to be with the voice they do not what the bush said the divorce was the important thing not the bush see the bush was only to attract his attention that he can hear what the voice was saying see the voice is the important thing that where god i wanted to hear his voice hear the voice of god hallelujah let's go to the book of genesis amen hallelujah adam and eve in the garden of eden you know they never saw the god that created them it's no more where in scripture that they say they saw anything physical or anything like that one thing the bible let us know that they heard god's voice they heard his voice see that's how they know it was god after they had done wrong the bible said they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day they heard his voice see that's all they knew was the voice of god that was able to fellowship with god because god spoke to them he spoke to them seeing they recognized when they had done wrong they heard his voice walking in the garden calling under adam see that's how god deals he deals with his voice now that's very important when you read the scripture you'll find out that all through the scripture god's only talking about one thing his voice he dealt he dealt with israel the same way i commanded thee not no sacrifice i command you on the offering there's only one thing i commanded you that is to obey my voice that's all god's concerned about you don't care about sacrifice so much you don't care about offering so much what he wants you to do is obey his voice see but first you got to discern the voice of god the voice of god i'm hearing i declare to you tonight this is the voice of god this is the voice of god speaking and speaking through your pastor god voices in your pastor now if you don't believe that he wouldn't do nothing he tell you to do you can piece to his face turn blue using he i ain't paying attention to him god ain't speaking through them the voice of guardians of them but if you believe that the voice of god is in your pastor then you'll do whatever he preaching for you to do because you know you don't believe us the man it's the voice of god come on somebody if it's the voice of god and you won't pay no attention but you believe with the voice of god then it'll take effect it'll do something for you but long you don't believe us the voice of god then you want to pay no attention but i declare to you tonight it's the voice of god god has been speaking god has been trying to call you back he will trying to turn you around and get you back to the voice get your back to the voice of god come back to the water i told any man's voices what is his word god has been turned on everything possible to get you to turn back amen to the word of god turn back to the word turn back to the voice amen by the grace of god oh god i read that i talked about genesis adam and eve heard a voice you didn't see nothing physical well i keep on saying because when sometimes you want to see something a lot of time we ain't gonna see nothing but we will hear a voice you might not never see anything but you will hear a voice you hear that voice talking to you telling you what to do where to go you will hear that voice jesus of any man hear my voice that's right he said in revelation the third chapter because i stand at the door and knock if any man do what hear my voice you hear the voice you want to be saved hear the voice of god many man hear my voice and open the door he said i'll come in and do and stop with him and he with me but first he got to do what he got to hear god's voice and god was always calling always calling trying to get in try you know the voice of god is is is contending with so many things now because you got so many things trying to drown the voice out you mean the children so wrapped up in the phone or the computer that god can't the voice can't penetrate but god's still speaking though he's trying to break through that barrier man for the children can do what hear the voice of god break the barrier through them phones i guarantee your god voice breaks through they put them phones down where god voice got to break through they put the tablet down they put the computer down they put everything down what they hear the voice of who of god god become more important now because god damn broke through and there was god trying to do that he's trying to break through to us everything trying to drown god's voice out our job trying to drown it out everything trying to drown the boy god voice out amen now we got to be hallelujah designed god's brother i'm going to have nothing john does i need to hear the voice of god i'm not going to let nothing drown it out i'm going to hear god's voice of god what god got to say is more important than anything we can say i want to hear the voice of god hallelujah you want to hear god's voice his voice is more important than anything i can ever say to you can you only hear god's voice amen you will get something tonight you're going with your head's voice god's voices can change it that's why he wants you to hear his voice hallelujah it changes you hey man when you can hear that voice many jesus they're gonna hear the voice of the son of god jesus they're gonna live many in the grave when they hear the voice they will come up amen amen why because they're part of him they're gonna hear his voice and they're gonna rise up in that day man when they hear the voice of god we want to hear god's voice political voice church boys school boards so many voices and it's pulling you this way they're pulling up that way but we come to find real life one thing important is to hear the voice of god what god's going to say about what god got to say about it you don't hear what your cousin said you don't hear what your uncle said don't hear what your aunt said know what god said you said i'm saying all the other voices that lead you are strengthened they only giving up what their opinion we don't need no opinion we need thus saith the lord i don't need your opinion i need what god saith the lord i need to hear the voice of god lord show me what to do lord speak to me father i need to know in jesus christ's name lord i need to hear your voice hallelujah i need to hear the voice of god lord let me hear your voice yeah i need to hear god's voice that's what i know what to do therefore i know which way to turn amen i need to hear the voice of god in these last days he laughs at all these voices trying to get our attention everything trying to get our attention trying to drown out the voice i'm not going to let him drop it out the whole no sir i need to have god's voice nobody got to listen to a team they won't have to listen to the bible they've got to read the bible inside that is to what the voice of god come on somebody you got to hear god's voice don't go on this world without listening to the voice of god you got to hear god's fault we all got to hear god i want to hear god's voice amen praise god notice here so not listening to the voice of god it gets you in all kind of trouble because people will lead you astray they got good intentions now don't get it wrong they got good intentions they don't mean no harm but remember it ain't got voice talking that's them talking their intention might be good and everything like that but it might lead you ascray it might lead you out of the will of god see that way you want to hear god's voice very important we hear voices of god look at uh an example here by the grace go to the book of samuel you all know the scripture here let's go to samuel uh 15. notice here how god uh sent saul on on on a journey to go and do something for him he sent his word to the prophet samuel samuel just a voice he's just a mouthpiece that god used to speak his word that's right he was only that's all he was saying thing is today god used men as mouthpiece to speak his word so then we have to discern did you not listen to man's word you might hear man's voice but really there's god's voice speaking with man's voice i said it's god's voice speaking with man's voice amen there are people get so twisted up sometimes they hate man's bar but really it's god's voice using man's voice amen the speaker's word that why is good not to have no ism or schism against nobody because if you're not careful you can shut down the voice none of y'all heard that or not that was good not to have no ism or schism against nobody because if so doing so you can shut down the voice see because you say oh i don't like him i don't like this one uh i don't see them what you're doing you're shutting down the voice of god see you don't know what god gonna say you know what god gonna do don't shut down the voice don't don't have nothing against nobody don't let nobody lead you or scrape by talking about somebody saying something about somebody don't let them leave you a script because a lot of time all that do is take you away from hearing the voice of god god can use anybody now he'll speak you've got to be able to discern and listen see you could god to speak now amen praise god let's go through our samuel amen amen first samuel 15 amen praise god y'all god sent him on the journey everything i did he started out doing real good he went and did something but he uh he got around some people oh man that really looks good oh that look good right there too let's keep that oh the king of the gang he don't look that bad let's keep him too people he was doing good he was following the voice of the lord but all of a sudden he got around some people that took them away from falling the voice of the lord did y'all hear that see people they don't mean no harm now i don't believe none of people made any harm but telling him to let's save this let's keep this let's get to him man god i've loved the sacrifice look how look that's a pretty one right there get that one there they gotta love that one yeah madam what god told him to do though that wasn't the voice of the lord you see that was not the voice of the law what did the voice of the lord tell them to do come on somebody kill everything everything don't leave nothing that was what the voice of who the lord kill everything don't bring nothing back but all the voice crepe inside there the people the voice of the people prevailed against the voice of god he let the voice of the people prevail over him against the voice of god lord have mercy don't let it fall into that trap of the devil amen don't let the devil let you it might have been might have been a relative a close relative yo you know we lose our relatives sometimes y'all come on somebody you know that close relative then they get you out of the will of god if there's somebody close amen they got him the the brick not to listen to the voice amen praise god first samuel amen the ninth verse but saul and the people spirit egg in the best of the sheep and of the oxen of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good not only destroyed them but everything that was vile and refuge that they utterly destroyed then came the word of the lord and the samuel saying it repented me that i have set up saul to be king he had gone back from following me and did not perform my commandment and he grieved salmon he cried unto the lord all night so these people got him in bad shape all right and 13th verse and samuel said uh samuel came to psalms said saul said unto him be blessed to be thou the lord i have performed the commandments of the lord and samuel said what mean at the end of the bleeding of the sheep of my neighbor where would these sheep come from then you don't deal with the law said you do what these sheep doing here what what these um what are these oxen doing around here what are they doing here what have you done done god's will you know you didn't do the word of the lord amen and saul said they have brought them back from their malachi for the people spared of the breath of the sheep and are the odds and sacrifice unto the law of thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed then samuel said uh stay all right notice the 17th verse let me read them down come down to it the 20th verse and saul said unto samuel yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord has sent me and have brought a gag the king of amalek and i'll destroy the malachites but the people took of the sheep of the spoil the sheep and the oxen and achieved a thing which should utterly be destroyed is sacrified unto the lord thy god and giggle and samuel said have the lord in great delight and burn offerings and sacrifice and obeying the voice of the lord that what god wants to do obey what his voice what's his voice says his word he said saul down there to do one simple thing but he said how people can get inside there and lead you astray from hearing god's voice it happens every day brother happened every day sister simple thing just like that simple little thing right there here got saul by the loser kingdom i'm not about to leave he lost the kingdom all because he failed to obey god's voice let other people let you us lead you astray don't you let people don't let nobody leave your screen we need to laugh in the last days now come on somebody we're in the end time that is too late to be led or scraped by the enemy it's too elect not to hear the voice of god to lay down any time come on somebody it ain't time it's time now to obey the voice of the lord hallelujah hear god's voice what god is saying to us god is calling us back to the word calling us back to wait man what did he say that man come on somebody he's done that he's that what he's doing he's calling us back amen praise god we are left off from hearing the voice of god god has come back again and said here amen the voice of the lord come back to the voice get away from these other voices and then come back to my voice my voice will lead you right my voice is showing which way to go my father tell you what to do my voice will lead you right here my voice hallelujah that was a holy ghost coming you don't see a pharmacy or but you had a voice a man supposed to be talking to you every day after the voice talks to you every day but ain't talking to you every day then something's wrong you should be able to hear the voice of god come on somebody this voice got to talk to you it leads you and it guides you and show you what to do hallelujah yes sir this holy ghost be talking about it's the voice of god yes gets in you and it leads you and you god you hear a voice and that voice i lead you correctly we know we do we squash that voice down that ain't no god thank god yet it is thank god yeah that is that's god don't squash it down that author has been trying to lead you all the time it'd be it'd be it talks to you you hear the voice don't squash it down oh lord have mercy hear the voice of god in jesus christ's name hallelujah this is the time amen notice how to go to the book of uh genesis notice how god uh used jacob jacob our mother amen to get him to do uh to do something amen praise god it wasn't jacob mother with god inside jacob's mother that voice that jacob heard is sonic and mother's voice but there was god in that voice god wanted jacob to get that birth right god wanted jacob to have it because god knew what he thought did god didn't need a man that would sell out he's our soulless birthright for a little bit of muscle of meat he sold it out god know he couldn't use a man like that so god was gonna give jacob the birthright hallelujah god gonna give jacob the blessing of the first bone amen god gonna give it to him because he know what he saw was all that he thought wasn't about nothing he sold his birthright what kind of man you're going to sow your birth right you know how precious your birthright is but about it he despised his birthright he despised his breath right the right of the first bone to get the line

right he's sold out of his breath right amen see a lot of people we did what we're doing today selling out our birthrights and god can't use somebody like that don't never sell out for nothing the devil tried to get jesus to sell out one day oh this is what i give thee if i was only fall down and do what worship me jesus get thee behind me satan god said worship the law that i got him only shall die i don't need this world you all belong to me anyway see see you guys there's a price behind it you got it don't sell out praise god don't judge for a little marcel of meat this man sold his breath right out for a muscle of meat amen and god now is gonna take away his blessing oh reason i say all that because i'm going to show you what how god is thinking now i can't get into god's mind like that but i'm going to show you that god going to take jake our easter blessing and give it to jacob god's going to take it from him why because he worthy of it because he stole his birthright amen the bible talks about in the book of hebrews you know jacob he saw you you start a crime that crying to bring that blessing back same thing you leave the lord fool around the devil to entice you get him from the law you can cry you won't you better do some hard crying get up and repent if god can help you come on somebody yes sir you're going to take a lot of strong crime but the bible said

voice calling the young man calling them see they were gonna hear the voice of god god voices calling oh lord have mercy god is calling still calling even tonight hallelujah god's still calling you're going to be able to discern the voice he thought it was eli calling him he didn't recognize the bargain that was the first in the bible there was no open vision so he didn't recognize the word of the lord bible they were not yet revealed to him so he didn't know really who was calling him eli tell the son i call you but lie down again and the boy will call you again say here am i speak lord thy servant hearing yes sir he gives him instruction on what to do but it wasn't elijah it was god's voice amen he's still calling i believe he is by the grace of god i never get genesis amen genesis 27 let's see what happened here see genesis 27 and 13. hallelujah went over all that right there look at 13th verse and his mother said unto him uh upon me be thy curse of my son only obey my voice i love that see his mom he thought of mom was trying to get him in trouble and trying to trick him so you know go do i take it with god all the time but one intent that was to give him the blessing i don't know y'all heard that or not take it away from me saul you don't deserve it give it to jacob hallelujah jacob wanted jacob wanted that stuff he wanted to further he wanted the breath ride he wanted the blessing of the first born see his mind was hallelujah he he wanted the right thing see lord i want the holy ghost hallelujah lord give me the hell i got to have it lord i need the holy ghost see his mind was in the right place come on his mind was in the right place whatever when we got said the only thing he wanted was the holy ghost lord give me the holy ghost lord i want to speak in tongues come on somebody that's all you wanted to do you want to experience that jacob wanted that blessing and god knew he wanted us to god now is taking it away from esau and giving it to jake who are how's he speaking he's speaking through his mother and the mother is imploring him son only obey my voice isn't that the same thing god said only of being my boy wasn't mama speaking it was god speaking through his mama you take the blessing away from esau i keep on saying i want you know god to take your blessing to you don't be careful you don't bear the voice of god didn't god take it away from israel god didn't obey his voice amen praise god god brought them out of the land of egypt amen one of them armies um i got the mark and passed about and they cried out to god god came and said i did this for you i did this for you and now you're going back to serving these idols he said you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this see to stop obeying the voice of the law see now we'll bear the voice of god everything goes good when we stop hearing and listening to the voice that when things start going bad they're gonna try to make it bad but we don't have to let it go bad we can stay right there and just stay with that voice amen so jacob mama under the influence of the holy ghost under influence of god instructed her son what to do amen in order to get the blessing son only obey my voice my your curse be on me see that was god working same thing today but there was god implore children obey your peers see why you think god say that it's a blessing inside of it lord have mercy lord jesus help us yes sir lord help us eh oh lord see you might want to go this way but god is using your mom to tell yourself don't go that way son do this daughter don't do that daughter do this you don't know why they're saying that but god telling them to say that they're helping you all you gotta do is talk into what the voice because there is them is god speaking through them trying to lead you if you will let them lead you hallelujah oh lord have mercy amen praise god let's go on let's look at abraham let's go to the book of genesis 22. i think not me by the holy spirit listen i believe it's we need a repentance amen do we we got to come back to the voice of god we don't run after everything let's come back to god's voice let's come back to hearing the voice of god see we we we need a repentance lord i i i repent lord that i am and hearing your voice like i should everything else i'm blocking it out i can't even hear the voice of god today i think we need as a repentance need to be called amen the people could come back to listening to the voice of god we run around doing everything every and anything and we ain't got time to listen to the voice of god maybe god will tell you said you don't need to do that today you need to stay home and pray but you so caught up in what you're doing you can't hear god's voice see we so caught up amen i think it's time to be uncaught up and caught up with god's voice lord what will you have me to do lord where you want me to go lord let me hear your boy i want to hear god's voice amen praise god i want to hear the voice of god genesis 22 amen praise god genesis 22 and 16. now god when god speak a lot of times he may say something to you that you might even find written inside the scripture but that doesn't mean it's not god's voice doesn't mean it's not god's voice a lot of things that was said was not written yet but never left with god speaking and the people did what god said then it became scripture but it wasn't written that okay i would get the bible and see it was in the bible no you're gonna be able to do that all the time you gotta take this thing by faith you gotta take this thing by faith i believe this is the voice of god and you act on it because in my timeline you can find it written he's a brother again that sounds contrary no it's not conjured about it the way god always works god knows changes program the god come and speak to you then it it becomes scripture amen it it it it'll line up if it's god's speaking it'll line up with what's been written it'll line right up so i'm going to say if god's speaking to you you're all the time it might gonna be written verbatim in the bible like we want to see it in there but it was the voice of god it'll come to pass that's what jesus said if you know how you know it's god's speaking if the thing that is spoken don't come to pass then you know it's not god speaking that's right but becoming the past then that's me said the lord that's right that's how we know so god might tell you to do something i believe when he told the young rich ruler to go say all you got give to the poor then come take up your cross and follow me that wasn't written that was jesus telling him to do all he'd do was to build a voice he would have been a blessed young man but he chose not to do it he was worried about his riches see don't get quiet now y'all getting scared and i gotta say you might don't be in the bible yeah if god's speaking they're gonna be right you're gonna get scared because i speak to you where do god speak you tonight say i want you to pack up and i want you to go to california is that what he told abraham you didn't even have him to go to california he told him i'm gonna take it to a land he didn't see nobody what he heard a voice the voice says get out of your country leave your kindred in your father's house until lander what i'll show thee he didn't see no ball all he heard was a void but abraham believed the voice and he followed the voice and the voice was the right voice god's voice leading him never god you got to tell you to do something now how you know the voice of god if it comes to pass we got to take it by faith though you gotta take it by faith never say anything it is tonight you gotta believe us god speaking and believe this is the word of the lord this ain't brother gibson it's god speaking i ain't god but god's voice god's word any man's word is what is a voice any man voices what is his word so the same thing is by faith you believe these things see so you got to believe us the voice of god man oh hallelujah preacher got up there and preached you got to believe that's god working believe that's god speaking until you see something different see that way you can then you can have confidence in the voice you're going to accomplish in the voice do you no good you got to have confidence not so much in the man but in the voice divorce is speaking you believing it's god speaking see then it can profit you but if you don't believe in god speaking it'll never profit you lord have mercy amen so believe just trust god in the black holy god told moses say god to mama do some things with you that the people may believe me forever i'm gonna do some things with you moses i'm gonna do things that he never seen before the people might believe you forever that when you speak they're gonna believe that's me speaking see that god gonna do again once again god gonna do the same thing god gonna do something hallelujah miracles one design gonna happen again amen we're going to happen and not somewhere fall right around us right in a a local ministry the remote a lot of people don't know nothing about that's how god works ain't the big great things that people look for god working in simplicity amen so god will start working and start doing things one thing he wants you to believe is him hey man you know that was the prophet's biggest challenge to get the people to do what that was the biggest challenge get them to believe that's still the greatest challenge today get the people to believe you don't let don't let it be signs of oneness just believe by faith that's right hallelujah hello lord have mercy genesis 22 oh thank you lord genesis 22 and 16. abraham notice how god told him to leave his father's house and all this

blessing i will bless thee and multiply i will multiply thy seed at the stars of heaven that the sand which is upon the seashore and thy sea shall possess the gear of his enemies and in thy season all the knees on earth be blessed because i have to obey my voice god didn't continue to sacrifice my son there ain't no god see i'm saying how you can tell you to do something you you got to take it by

testing that man faith to test your faith too god just testing his faith now because you're obeying my voice nothing's going to be limited nothing will be limited to you because you did what god told

the man he said the voice listen to the voice what is the voice saying the voice is only trying to get you closer to god divorcing leading you away from god is trying to get you closer to god see that

he still speaks amen all we need to do is hear the voice of god right by the grace of god i thank god for the word tonight this much been said and if we can only hear what the spirit has to say to the church we appreciate it i was reading uh finney and um and i was just reading and it was you know talking about different ministers and they said that um somebody wanted revival finney deals with revival without revival the lord gave him a you know a revivalist ministry and he was one of the people that probably god talked about finney and um god used him mightily but anyway he was saying that the people want a revival in the city the church wanted a revival and the preacher prayed and prayed and prayed for revival preacher wanted a revival so he failed to seek god praying for revival you want a revival so bad seeking god praying fasting doing everything trying to bring revival the people wanted revival he was so desperate for revival until he died trying to bring revival to the people so the next preacher came the people still wanted to revive a revival he went there praying and praying seeking for revival it was so hard you know to get the people and revive a movie so they had a little spurt every night and then but the people got back you know just like the world but he wanted revival revival so that preacher he jesus got so woe out and not done he left he just left he was just he had done he just wore himself out you know did everything he could do and it just it was so much on him if he wouldn't have left it would have killed him too so um so they came to one of the trusted men in the church came to afini and asked him to come to the church because they wanted revival and finnish say you don't kill one you don't want another one and you want me to come to give a revival he said you go you go back and you tell that church if they want revival they need to repent and they need to get out and they need to what happened was they wanted the preacher to give them revival but they weren't doing nothing and so uh finney told them y'all want revival y'all y'all wasn't helping the preacher but y'all wanted revival but y'all wasn't doing what it takes to have a revival but y'all want the preacher to do it all and the preacher killed itself but y'all wasn't supporting him so what happened amen he said you go back and you tell that those people to repent and tell them to clean up their lives and all and then he began to cry out for revival themselves and then you come back and god will send them a preacher and a pastor for them but they got to do it you see what and i you know and he was telling some other stories about he said i've seen uh a thousand different situations he was telling how preachers got wore out and how do people kill the preacher and i said oh lord he said people can kill the preacher and the people can't help the preacher he's the one he said he said one of the things that that uh uh kills the uh preacher is that the people don't want the preacher to be personal he said but if the preacher don't be personal and don't preach on personal your personal life he said if he don't then god ain't using it he said but that's what oh he picking on me pic he said if he don't pick on you then god ain't using him he must pick on you it must be personal he said that's how you know god is using him when he when it's personal and i said oh lord he why he said that it's got to be personal uh who told him about that personal it's got to be personal he said how many times thousands of times people have come to me because the preachers have preached personal and that's what he said hearing the voice then it becomes the voice of god to you god is speaking to you personally as individuals amen god must speak to you with his voice amen god bless you tonight amen i i kind of got excited because it reminded was doing me some good i i wish i could give everybody like i used to do around the mall and sometimes just give
