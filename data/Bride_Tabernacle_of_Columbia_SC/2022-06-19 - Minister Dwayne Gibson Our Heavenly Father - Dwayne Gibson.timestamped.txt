[32:18] don't forget i'm trying to look for a
[32:19] scripture i had it written down
[32:22] and it ain't to the right place
[32:24] but that scripture was good too
[32:26] amen praise god all of a work together
[32:28] for the good amen praise the lord
[32:32] amen praise god
[32:46] praise the lord
[33:08] amen praise god malachi 1 6. as the
[33:12] father honors his son as the son honored
[33:14] his father and his servant his master
[33:17] if i they then i be a father where is my
[33:21] honor and if i be a master where's my
[33:24] fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o
[33:26] priest that despised my name and he said
[33:29] when have we despised science and we're
[33:31] going to talk about our heavenly father
[33:32] this morning
[33:34] our heavenly father we thank god for
[33:36] father's day this is what the world
[33:38] called father's day nothing against that
[33:40] but we understand a lot of
[33:41] responsibility going with that term
[33:43] called father
[33:45] you know we are you know children are
[33:47] born and we have responsibility as
[33:49] parents and especially the fathers to be
[33:51] a provider
[33:52] a man to to be a protector and many
[33:54] other things there's a lot of
[33:56] responsibility that goes with that term
[33:58] father
[33:59] and we know that everybody is not worthy
[34:01] of that term though everybody get the
[34:04] praise for it we know they're not worthy
[34:06] of it because they don't take care of
[34:08] the responsibility
[34:10] so it's a good great responsibility to
[34:12] be not something light to say i got a
[34:14] child i got a daughter i got a son well
[34:17] that's good but are you doing the
[34:18] responsibility to come along with that
[34:21] see there's a responsibility that we
[34:23] must measure opportunity we know a lot
[34:25] of times we fall short
[34:28] many young men fall short in this day
[34:32] they far of their responsibility they
[34:34] don't do what they're supposed to do yet
[34:36] on this day called father and everybody
[34:38] happy and things like that and but when
[34:41] you come down and look at the
[34:42] responsibility are you taking care of
[34:44] the responsibility
[34:46] that was god looking at so god being our
[34:49] father our heavenly father he take care
[34:52] of his responsibility
[34:54] he never failed us as a father now we
[34:56] have to understand that he is our father
[35:00] god is your heavenly father
[35:03] so we give thanks to the natural side
[35:05] but what about the spiritual side
[35:08] we are to wake up giving thanks to our
[35:10] heavenly father every day
[35:13] amen he's our heavenly father and he has
[35:15] never failed as he had never failed to
[35:18] his responsibility to as a father
[35:21] i think he had never referred his
[35:22] responsibility
[35:24] he's always been there as a provider as
[35:26] a protector
[35:27] to keep us amen why because he is our
[35:30] heavenly father
[35:31] amen praise god so we want to give
[35:33] everything to him today
[35:36] he said if i'm a father then where's
[35:38] mine on
[35:39] see we lack giving him the honor we want
[35:41] to give honor to one another not wrong
[35:43] with that now especially if you're
[35:45] living up to your responsibility
[35:48] if you're a father this morning and
[35:50] you're living up to your responsibility
[35:51] as a father then god bless you
[35:54] but if you're a father this morning you
[35:57] got children in this world that god have
[35:58] allowed you to have
[36:00] and you're not living up to your
[36:02] responsibility then you need to do
[36:03] better
[36:06] i believe every young man every person
[36:09] that got children in this world you're
[36:10] not living up to your responsibility as
[36:12] a father then you need to do better
[36:16] god is our example how to be a father to
[36:19] take care of what the lord has given us
[36:22] our children
[36:24] the bible that the inheritors of the
[36:25] lord that's right
[36:27] your children is inheritance of the lord
[36:29] so you ought to take care of that which
[36:31] god has entrusted you with
[36:33] come on somebody
[36:35] i said god has entrusted you with
[36:37] something
[36:38] a responsibility
[36:41] it's a blessing that god have allowed
[36:42] you that us to have children to have
[36:45] children
[36:46] are the children should be a blessing
[36:47] not a curse that's right
[36:49] don't let your children be a curse see
[36:51] you let them be a blessing to you man
[36:52] you say what ain't doing right that's
[36:54] all right it's still going to be a
[36:55] blessing to you what you got to do you
[36:57] got to pray for him didn't god our
[36:59] father pray for us
[37:01] is god praying for us
[37:03] amen that we might come out right
[37:06] pray for your children that god will
[37:07] bless them to do what come out right
[37:10] you know what you're looking for in this
[37:11] world your your your birthing and your
[37:13] raising your feeding you do everything
[37:15] you can for them and a lot of times they
[37:17] don't come out right
[37:19] but you know what there's not no reason
[37:21] not to continue to pray for him
[37:24] there's not no reason to continue to
[37:25] believe that god can touch him
[37:28] it's a responsibility and once god gives
[37:30] you that responsibility you never let go
[37:32] of that responsibility you always going
[37:35] to be a father to that child
[37:37] no matter what that how old hallelujah
[37:39] god is always going to be our father
[37:43] even when we go on screen sometimes he
[37:45] never
[37:46] oh my god shucker's responsibility
[37:49] even when adam and eve went to screen
[37:51] the garden of eden i said god their
[37:53] father was right there for him
[37:55] i say he was
[37:57] he went there and dude it was in the
[37:58] wrong he he went there provided away
[38:01] form
[38:02] amen a lot of time and
[38:05] you know being a father you come that
[38:07] time and place of correction
[38:10] a lot of times we don't want to bring
[38:11] that correction like a shirt but thank
[38:14] god our heavenly father he is not afraid
[38:16] to give us correction
[38:18] i think god isn't afraid
[38:20] the bible whom the lord love you does
[38:22] what he chase him see he's not afraid to
[38:25] bring correction because he know
[38:27] correction is what gonna keep us
[38:28] straight
[38:30] correction of what keeps the child
[38:32] in the right path
[38:34] being a son or daughter you don't
[38:36] correct your child the bible says it
[38:38] will go astray
[38:40] and even under correction sometimes
[38:42] they're still going straight but you as
[38:44] a parent as a father you must pray for
[38:46] them
[38:48] oh my god
[38:50] god prayed for us
[38:52] in the form of his son the lord jesus
[38:54] christ coming down may manifest in the
[38:56] flesh he's i prayed for thee that thy
[38:58] faith faithful or not amen
[39:00] so all that the father had given him he
[39:02] prayed for us that we wouldn't go astray
[39:05] so our heavenly father we ought to give
[39:08] all the glory and all the honor to him
[39:10] today
[39:11] if he is your father now you gotta you
[39:13] gotta you have to recognize that god is
[39:16] your father
[39:18] and that don't come lightly
[39:20] everybody is not god or not everybody's
[39:22] father

[39:25] let's go to the gospel come to john it's
[39:27] sad to say but god is not everybody's
[39:30] father

[39:53] told nicodemus he came seeking jesus by
[39:55] night jesus told nicodems he must be
[39:58] born again that's right so it's a birth
[40:01] that must take place inside our lives
[40:04] for god to recognize the will of his

[40:08] naturally by a mom and a dad and that

[43:08] spirit he cannot even see the kingdom of
[43:10] god
[43:11] the man be born again he cannot even

[43:14] of this kingdom

[43:50] foreknew you to be a man always a son of
[43:53] god always a daughter of god always one
[43:56] of his
[43:57] amen look at the gospel calling to john
[43:59] amen praise the lord
[44:01] amen
[44:04] uh john the eighth chapter
[44:18] being a father is a hard job that was
[44:20] the kind of responsibility
[44:22] a lot of times men we run from that
[44:24] responsibility
[44:26] we don't want to do that what must be
[44:27] done see
[44:29] we must provide
[44:32] see that's that's that's our
[44:34] responsibility god when god when man got
[44:36] away from god and the god of eden god
[44:38] told man he got to work by the sweat of
[44:40] his brother that's right
[44:41] he had to go out there and provide for
[44:43] his family and we live in an age now
[44:45] that men don't want to come up to that
[44:47] responsibility they don't want to work
[44:52] lord have mercy
[44:54] i'm not a man
[44:56] their father got children
[44:58] don't want to work
[45:00] don't want to be the provider
[45:03] that god made them to be god made the
[45:05] man to be the provider that's right
[45:07] the sisters working on thing that's good
[45:09] all right but you ain't going to be the
[45:10] provider
[45:12] man is supposed to be a divider how you
[45:14] say yeah that striker in god provider
[45:18] amen the natural type the spiritual god
[45:20] is your you want to form i found an
[45:22] example of a good father that none other
[45:25] than god
[45:27] he's the example we should follow that's
[45:28] right
[45:30] he provides for us
[45:32] he provides everything
[45:34] so that man he must be the what the
[45:37] provider
[45:39] that's his what responsibility
[45:42] see that's his responsibility the
[45:44] woman's now and this is right here y'all
[45:46] don't be able to talk to you
[45:48] and if they ain't right here women want
[45:50] to be the provider you let that man make
[45:51] you the provider
[45:54] because you're not supposed to be the
[45:55] man put the beautiful body that's right
[45:57] it ain't a 50-50 deal either there's a
[46:00] hundred percent thing
[46:02] and then 50-50
[46:05] you take this half
[46:06] nope it's a 100 deal
[46:09] doesn't god do it 100
[46:12] hundred percent deal
[46:14] it ain't a 50-50 deal it's a hundred
[46:17] percent
[46:18] you know we're the provider god made it
[46:20] that way
[46:21] that's the way god placed it amen so we
[46:23] ought to come up to what our
[46:26] responsibility god is going to do his he
[46:29] you will never say god did what he's
[46:31] supposed to do
[46:33] you'll never say it man
[46:35] he's always doing what he's supposed to
[46:37] do you're always provides he always does
[46:40] what he said you can never say god you
[46:42] didn't live up to your responsibility
[46:44] god always keeps his word
[46:47] he lives up to his responsibility as a
[46:49] father he does exactly what he
[46:52] say he'll do hallelujah what he needs to
[46:55] do sometimes we need discipline lord he
[46:57] knows how to do it don't he
[46:59] oh lord he know how to do it you know
[47:00] how to do it you know the discipline i
[47:02] said man to bring us back to the right
[47:04] spot where we need to be he knows how to
[47:06] do it sometimes we lack that wisdom on
[47:08] how to discipline children but i say god
[47:10] knows how to discipline this morning you
[47:12] know how to do it to bring us right back
[47:14] to him
[47:16] and that what you want to do come back
[47:17] to god
[47:18] when we go straight sometimes get out
[47:20] the way get on the wrong track
[47:23] if you're god's child
[47:25] god will make sure you come back
[47:27] see he knows how to discipline us
[47:29] sometimes i say we lack that wisdom
[47:32] and it takes wisdom sometimes to
[47:33] discipline children
[47:36] because the bible says um fathers be not
[47:38] um uh are harsh or be not um bitter
[47:41] against your children whatever the
[47:42] scriptures saying that wise uh you you
[47:44] gotta we gotta get that wisdom
[47:47] see cause sometimes we can we can run
[47:49] them away
[47:51] we can run them away god don't want us
[47:53] to get do you think god want to run you
[47:54] away god don't want to run your way may
[47:56] god i want you to stay inside the camp
[47:58] that's right
[47:59] he wants you to stay where in the
[48:00] father's house he wants you to stay
[48:02] right there because to get out the
[48:04] father's house is to get in all kind of
[48:06] trouble amen
[48:07] god's going to john the uh eighth
[48:09] chapter amen praise the lord
[48:12] amen john 18 39
[48:15] it's sad to say every god is not
[48:17] everybody's father
[48:21] and that's the spiritual
[48:22] revelation
[48:25] to realize that
[48:26] some people are not god they're not
[48:28] god's children
[48:30] they belong to somebody else they belong
[48:32] they belong to the enemy we're going to
[48:33] read here
[48:34] john 8 39 then jesus then answered and
[48:36] said unto him abraham was our father
[48:38] jesus said unto them if you were
[48:39] abraham's children you would do the
[48:41] works of abraham but now you seek to
[48:43] kill me a man that had told you the
[48:44] truth would have heard of god this did
[48:46] not abraham do you do the deeds of your
[48:49] father
[48:50] then say they to him we be not born of
[48:52] fornication we have one father even god
[48:55] they have you jesus and if god were your
[48:57] father you would love me for i proceeded
[49:00] forth and came from god neither came out
[49:02] of myself but he sent me
[49:04] why do you understand my speech even
[49:07] because you cannot hear my word notice
[49:08] here you have your father who
[49:12] you mean your father's the devil
[49:15] some people father is who
[49:18] that's hard ain't it
[49:21] that's very hard
[49:24] they know these people fathers the devil
[49:26] and they they ain't gonna be saved
[49:29] the father's who
[49:31] the devil
[49:33] god is a father the devil got children
[49:35] out there too
[49:37] and the bible says there's two people in
[49:38] this world the children of light and the
[49:40] children of what darkness
[49:43] so some people's father is the devil
[49:44] that's what they can't stop doing wrong
[49:47] they can't help themselves their father
[49:49] is the devil that would jesus say you do
[49:51] the works of your fathers
[49:53] your father was a murderer from the
[49:54] beginning
[49:56] there was a murder they wanted to kill
[49:57] jesus he abolished not on the truth
[49:59] because he knows truth there i mean you
[50:00] don't speak alive because he's the
[50:01] father of it so these people father was
[50:03] up the devil they were doing the same
[50:05] work to the father doing if we god's
[50:07] children hallelujah we're just saying
[50:09] work so far to do man
[50:12] come on somebody you'll do the same
[50:13] works he did now
[50:15] i don't talk about some americans stuff
[50:17] like that but you live right and do
[50:18] right
[50:21] amen why you got his gene inside you
[50:24] you take the characteristics of who your
[50:26] father or your mother why they got your
[50:28] genes in them that's right we got god
[50:30] dna and how we get dog dna in us by the
[50:33] holy ghost amen come on somebody you got
[50:35] god dear in you inside you and you can't
[50:38] help but doing what's right
[50:41] until you get god's dna inside you then
[50:43] you can't do what's right
[50:45] why you have your father who the devil
[50:50] the devil children can't do right
[50:53] the devil he can't pay the devil to do
[50:55] right jesus i'm saying ain't gonna do
[50:56] right

[50:59] lies all day long
[51:01] he ain't gonna do what's right
[51:03] his children ain't gonna do what's right
[51:05] either
[51:06] so you can be god's child you're going
[51:08] to be the devil's child that's not me
[51:09] saying that's the did y'all read that in
[51:10] the bible
[51:12] the bible said that jesus called those
[51:14] religious people of that day he said
[51:16] you're of your father who the devil
[51:20] then god said king was of who
[51:23] the wicked one
[51:26] king father was who the devil
[51:29] from the garden of eden said i think
[51:30] pass on down the line from the garden of
[51:33] eden
[51:34] see god god word can't lie
[51:38] cain
[51:40] was satan's child
[51:42] that's why he did
[51:44] what he did
[51:45] he took the attributes of the
[51:47] characteristics of his daddy
[51:50] he killed and murdered just like his
[51:52] daddy did that's right

[58:51] eternal life
[58:53] adam can die that's right

[59:10] we always had it that we're not just
[59:12] getting that we always had it
[59:14] and god is bringing us back to it see
[59:15] that's what his purpose is amen praise

[59:43] heart fervently being born again see
[59:47] not of corruptible seed but of what
[59:49] incorruptible by the word of god which

[59:55] be what born again
[59:58] by what kind of seed
[1:00:00] incorruptible by what the word of god
[1:00:04] being born again see that what jesus

[1:00:08] born again
[1:00:10] see
[1:00:11] and peter doesn't know is by this
[1:00:13] incorruptible seed which is what the
[1:00:15] word of god jesus said the seed is the
[1:00:17] what the word
[1:00:19] so the seed is the word of god and god's
[1:00:21] seed
[1:00:22] god planted that seed inside of you
[1:00:24] since when the foundation of the world
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:31] a little bit of sunlight
[1:00:33] when the water and the light scratch the
[1:00:35] seed it comes to life
[1:00:38] when god sent you that water and that
[1:00:40] light of the word struck you it came to
[1:00:42] life
[1:00:43] amen you might have been covered up all
[1:00:45] kind of muck and stuff but when the when
[1:00:47] the word came you came to life
[1:00:50] see we were covered up by muck
[1:00:53] let's see you lay under that muck that
[1:00:55] don't mean it's dead it just landed
[1:00:57] dormant until the sun here that's right
[1:00:59] until the light hit it that's how we our
[1:01:01] lives were we were all mucked up by the
[1:01:03] devil look we wasn't even a child of god
[1:01:05] about how we've been living but the
[1:01:07] light came
[1:01:08] amen the word came and shone upon it
[1:01:11] amen and whatever that seed dead came to
[1:01:13] life
[1:01:14] proving that we was always god's child
[1:01:17] the devil tried to muck us up but he
[1:01:18] couldn't do it because we were blown to
[1:01:20] god god didn't lose none of his children
[1:01:21] that's right jesus all that the father
[1:01:23] has given me will come to me and those
[1:01:25] that the father has given me none shall
[1:01:27] be lost that's right
[1:01:29] save who the son of perdition

[1:01:33] lost
[1:01:35] god need to lose none of
[1:01:36] his oh hallelujah all the fathers giving
[1:01:39] me will come to me that's right
[1:01:41] all god's children gonna come so if god

[1:02:13] things for us he's the one that got us
[1:02:15] where we are today and we don't give him
[1:02:17] enough praise for what he's doing for us
[1:02:19] sometimes we thank god for the little
[1:02:21] things we got but we fail to realize
[1:02:23] that is our heavenly father that has
[1:02:25] allowed us to have these things so god
[1:02:28] is a good father that i want to pray to
[1:02:30] you this morning god is a good father

[1:03:08] it said for we have not received the
[1:03:10] spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:03:13] but yet receive the spirit of adoption
[1:03:16] whereby we cry our father amen
[1:03:19] the holy spirit in you and me cries out
[1:03:22] our father it cries out
[1:03:25] to god our father the holy spirit now
[1:03:29] before you got the holy spirit you never
[1:03:31] was crying out to god
[1:03:33] the holy spirit in you causes us to do
[1:03:35] what the cried to god
[1:03:37] it recognizes where it comes from
[1:03:40] it comes from god then jesus said i come
[1:03:42] from god i'll go back to god that's
[1:03:44] right so now they recognize the way it

[1:10:09] dangerous
[1:10:11] a child want a car

[1:10:15] so you don't give it to them right
[1:10:17] you know they ain't mature you know they
[1:10:19] ain't mature enough to handle a car
[1:10:20] so you don't give it well i want a car

[1:10:25] no car
[1:10:26] well when you get a little more chair
[1:10:30] and i see you can handle responsibility

[1:10:35] but i want a brand new one nope you got
[1:10:36] to get a hooptie
[1:10:37] [Laughter]
[1:10:43] they want a new one now
[1:10:45] but don't get them a new one
[1:10:47] might be a mistake
[1:10:49] you got the money to spend on that's up
[1:10:50] to you don't get a child new because you
[1:10:52] got you know we got
[1:10:53] we had to earn our way
[1:10:59] we didn't get all new stuff
[1:11:02] when we wanted that stuff we had to earn
[1:11:04] our way
[1:11:06] and this generation right here we give
[1:11:07] way too much without them earning
[1:11:10] and that's why they don't appreciate
[1:11:12] they want to get up they throw it away
[1:11:14] don't bother no more
[1:11:15] but we got to learn that you know god
[1:11:17] does what god does us as a father that
[1:11:20] we're going to give everything we want
[1:11:22] he gives us what we have need of
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:25] don't give us everything we want you get
[1:11:27] what we have need of and that's a
[1:11:28] blessing
[1:11:30] if we got everything we wanted only god
[1:11:31] knows where to turn up at
[1:11:34] but god gives us what we have neither am
[1:11:37] i amen you might stay inside the way
[1:11:39] that's right
[1:11:40] amen so god didn't let us out to him

[1:11:45] righteous forsaken or seed doing but
[1:11:47] begging bread
[1:11:48] no child of god i have that testimony
[1:11:51] they know the heavenly father can apply
[1:11:53] every need they have need of amen so god
[1:11:55] can never tell me to come and say i
[1:11:57] believe i trusted god and god know
[1:11:59] that's a lie
[1:12:02] god
[1:12:03] does everything he say
[1:12:06] you don't fail there in that time you're
[1:12:07] going to apply all your knees according
[1:12:10] riches and glory by christ jesus that's
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:12] so god will not let you out do him that
[1:12:14] let me get to you this morning if we
[1:12:16] have natural parents can give to our
[1:12:18] children when they ask us for something

[1:12:23] something he'll give it to us if it's
[1:12:25] good
[1:12:27] it's got to be a good thing now it can't
[1:12:28] be something we just want or just to
[1:12:30] have got to be something good another
[1:12:32] thing god can give you then what
[1:12:34] what's the best thing god can give us
[1:12:36] the holy ghost

[1:13:01] get the holy ghost that's the best thing
[1:13:03] you can get from god is the holy ghost
[1:13:05] nothing better

[1:14:24] not me holy spirit listen
[1:14:26] we do things sometimes and it's not
[1:14:29] intentional but we do think sometimes it
[1:14:31] does hurt our children
[1:14:34] that's right you know it's not
[1:14:35] intentionally
[1:14:36] because we want them to have everything
[1:14:38] people here those people come i want my
[1:14:40] child to have everything i had that
[1:14:41] might not be a good thing
[1:14:44] i want to have everything i didn't have
[1:14:47] when i was growing up that might don't
[1:14:49] be too good a thing
[1:14:51] so we can destroy them unintentionally
[1:14:56] you wouldn't intentionally give them a
[1:14:57] scorpion
[1:14:59] but unintentionally you're trying to do
[1:15:01] good so you give them things that really
[1:15:02] you shouldn't give them and that's what
[1:15:04] destroys them
[1:15:05] amen so if you're being evil in order to
[1:15:07] give your good gift under your children
[1:15:10] how emotional your heavenly father give
[1:15:12] what

[1:15:15] oh you ain't reading with me okay give
[1:15:17] the holy spirit to them that what
[1:15:20] ask him and then we just read in the
[1:15:22] previous scripture he said good things
[1:15:26] luke picks it up and said give what the
[1:15:29] holy ghost
[1:15:31] same thing axis storm the same thing so
[1:15:33] good thing the good thing is what the
[1:15:36] holy

[1:16:05] they'll be born again baptized he's our
[1:16:08] give you the gift of the what the holy
[1:16:10] ghost

[1:16:17] to ask amen
[1:16:18] i asked every day time i wanted to speak
[1:16:22] in tongues though
[1:16:23] but i believe that the holy ghost came
[1:16:24] by speaking in tongues that we believe
[1:16:25] in pentecost so after i got baptized all
[1:16:28] i want to do was speak in tongues and i
[1:16:30] ask every day lord let me speak in times
[1:16:31] lord let me speak in time lord let me

[1:17:06] you don't feel that acts

[1:18:10] house

[1:18:23] see this young man made a bad mistake
[1:18:26] during the time he didn't look like mom
[1:18:27] but he made a bad mistake he left the
[1:18:30] father's house
[1:18:33] all because he wanted to go out there
[1:18:35] and live like you saw the rest of the
[1:18:37] people living
[1:18:39] he want to get a little stuff and his
[1:18:40] father provided form god gives us gifts

[1:18:54] god
[1:18:57] you gotta you got an inherent chance
[1:18:59] where you get that from from god
[1:19:02] so he gave this young man man they give
[1:19:04] me my stuff that belonged to me my
[1:19:05] inheritance and the stuff that you done
[1:19:07] blessed me with give them to me and i'm
[1:19:09] gone
[1:19:11] get my my stuff i'm gone i'm going ahead
[1:19:14] and i'm gonna experience the world
[1:19:17] lord hamlet that's so dangerous
[1:19:20] he had to learn though see but the thing
[1:19:22] is he left the father's house
[1:19:26] don't leave the father's house
[1:19:29] stay right with god oh hallelujah say
[1:19:31] rival god got your ass don't leave the
[1:19:34] father's house
[1:19:36] hallelujah don't leave the father's
[1:19:38] house
[1:19:39] they mean cause it's out there if you
[1:19:41] leave the father's house then number
[1:19:43] trouble out there stay in the father's
[1:19:44] house amen stand the word of god
[1:19:47] stand the message for the owl stay in
[1:19:49] the revelation of god's word don't leave
[1:19:52] the father's house
[1:19:54] hallelujah
[1:19:56] that young man left the father's house
[1:19:58] he thought he was doing something but
[1:20:00] really he was just messing his life up
[1:20:03] and it didn't get messed up
[1:20:06] amen because he did the wrong thing his
[1:20:08] heavenly father is it's a type it's a
[1:20:11] type you talk about he never mentioned
[1:20:13] the mother you know it's talking about
[1:20:14] who the father
[1:20:16] the father it was the focus was on the
[1:20:18] father
[1:20:19] and i believe that man everything in the
[1:20:21] power
[1:20:22] to raise that boy right
[1:20:25] he raised him right
[1:20:27] but sometimes i influence who we get
[1:20:29] around who will our child chill and be
[1:20:31] around is the influence
[1:20:33] and they want to follow that influence
[1:20:35] see so he might have got around some
[1:20:37] people that was you know doing the
[1:20:38] things that sometimes we try to hold our
[1:20:40] children back from and i'll guarantee i
[1:20:42] believe the father's doing everything to
[1:20:43] hold his child back from there
[1:20:46] because he didn't want to go out in the
[1:20:47] world and mess his life up but that
[1:20:49] influence
[1:20:51] of other people caused him to want to go
[1:20:52] out there so he got his stuff and went
[1:20:54] out to the world the bible said he
[1:20:56] wished it was what riot is living when
[1:21:00] do everything the world was doing the
[1:21:01] smoking the drinking the gambling
[1:21:03] they're running around he did it all
[1:21:06] until the money ran out
[1:21:08] the little gifts ran out
[1:21:10] but god had blessed them with it ran out
[1:21:13] amen he began to being want the bible
[1:21:15] saying you will be in one
[1:21:17] god's applying all your needs right now
[1:21:18] remember he's applying all your needs
[1:21:20] right now right leave the father's house
[1:21:23] see what happened to you you can be
[1:21:24] unwarmed
[1:21:25] you're gonna be in need
[1:21:27] but thank you to god
[1:21:29] the bible says he came to himself
[1:21:32] somebody clicked in his head i don't
[1:21:33] know what happened when someone clicked
[1:21:35] in his head he came to him said the
[1:21:36] bible says how much my how much my my
[1:21:39] father's servant got in my father's
[1:21:41] house and i'm out here perishing with
[1:21:43] hunger he's i'm going back home
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:48] well lord see in the father's house he
[1:21:50] had no need i want
[1:21:52] in the father's house he had no need of
[1:21:54] nothing and when he came to himself he
[1:21:56] recognized that did y'all just hear
[1:21:58] about this oh hallelujah he recognized
[1:22:01] that when he was in his father's house
[1:22:03] he had no need
[1:22:06] he had everything supplied everything
[1:22:07] was just going smooth one he was where
[1:22:09] in his father's house
[1:22:12] everything was going but then but by the
[1:22:13] grace of god god allowed him to come to
[1:22:15] himself he said no i'm going back home
[1:22:18] he said father i've sinned against
[1:22:19] heaven and against thee no more words
[1:22:21] that we call our godless son but he can
[1:22:23] never not be called his son
[1:22:26] you can never not be called that i don't
[1:22:27] care what your child do you always gonna
[1:22:29] identify with him
[1:22:30] whether to do good or bad you're gonna
[1:22:32] identify with them
[1:22:33] i don't care if they're in prison that's
[1:22:34] still your son
[1:22:36] okay where did he act that's through
[1:22:38] your son
[1:22:39] the father recognized that his father
[1:22:41] was in bad shape but guess what he did
[1:22:44] not recognize that that was his son
[1:22:48] hallelujah
[1:22:49] he was so spiritual the bible says he
[1:22:51] saw something coming from a long ways
[1:22:53] off i thought about that a long ways off
[1:22:55] he might have seen a vision
[1:22:59] the bible says solve them a long ways
[1:23:00] off let's read that by the grace of god
[1:23:02] he might have saw a vision man god might
[1:23:05] see you when you're spiritual god we'll
[1:23:07] show you a thing about your children
[1:23:10] when you praying like the lord said pray
[1:23:12] and do everything god will show you

[1:23:24] sure enough she called is that me right
[1:23:28] god assure you
[1:23:30] your children your children
[1:23:32] just this father had a spiritual eye
[1:23:34] i mean he he he was able to see his son
[1:23:37] from a far off
[1:23:38] the bible said luke 15 amen praise the
[1:23:40] lord
