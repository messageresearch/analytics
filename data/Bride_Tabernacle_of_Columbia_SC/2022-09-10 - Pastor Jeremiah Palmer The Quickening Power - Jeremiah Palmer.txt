mother body lord scripture lord god let your spirit have preeminence now we ask these blessings tonight in jesus name amen amen have your bibles return with us to the book of psalms 119. it's good to be in the house of the lord again amen seem like things are moving so fast and so quick and like don't even have enough time to do things that you really want to do amen but uh always want to give god first place and everything amen psalms 119 37-40 turn away my eyes from beholding vanity and quicken down me in thy way establish that word into the servant who is devoted to that fear turn away my reproach which i fear for that judgments are good behold i have long after thy precepts quicken me in thy righteousness let us pray father lord i pray you bless your word tonight bless the people in jesus name amen amen may be seated while you also want to turn as quickly i want to come back to psalms but i want to also go and read the book of ephesians the second chapter ephesians 2 1 one and two and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where any time pass you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince and the of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience and go back with me to the book of psalms please i want to speak just a few minutes tonight on the quickening power the quickening power i know we have heard before and we have heard it maybe from different angles but tonight we need the quickening power the word quicken means to be made alive to be made alive here david was saying here in 119 and thirties he said turn away my eyes from beholding vanity in other words david just didn't uh want just to look at something that really have no value to it david was looking for god to quicken him i believe tonight that that's one of the things that that i see is liking so much he desire i understand that we have plenty of truth that god had made known to us in this hour we call it you know the message and i appreciate what god did in this hour but paul said one place that the letter killeth but the spirit give life paul say one place ah we didn't come to you with enticing words of men's wisdom but we came to you in demonstration and power of the holy ghost i wonder sometimes or rather we afraid of it or the quickening power i mean there's a song that i like to sing in the song but it's called the old time holy spirit and the devil won't go near it it is more than just a song it's a reality because the devil knows that as long as we just have the mechanical of the bible the truth with no spirit with no quickening power remember he is a good impersonator i believe i i could say i guess because that it started in heaven that he preached to a third of god's angels i believe he must have had something that he said that really sound convincing and it convinced a third of the angels to believe his lie so it's showing that uh even satan himself the bible said can be transformed into an angel of light in other words he has a gospel also every time god moved the devil moves but he only impersonates what god has already established and it looked like uh he's getting uh a big um i want to say this a lot of people to believe his lie because that the socialism of being a motivated speaker see and in this age we have a school that where you can really go and learn how to articulate and you can move crowds with emotionalism but where is the power the gospel we are talking about it ought to be a living resurrection of jesus christ displaying his word oh i i just wished as i just looked and just sometimes over the banister a little bit you know and and just i'm wondering sometimes what are we missing when i say we i mean overall what are we missing with all of the truth that god has made known to us it still yet don't seem to make us alive don't we have a lot of information do we have uh what we call the truth as paul called it present day truth and i thank god for it you know uh for god's sending it but i understand just laying it there on the bible and we rehearse it we we quote it uh what are our little favorites saying say what he say and that's all right but how about let's make the word come alive then because just to say what somebody said a child can repeat what you say but what we need is a quickening power something to change our very inside and it'll cause our life to uh reflect jesus christ it'll make you so salty that somebody want what you got they had so much of the quickening power in the book of the acts when they saw that man there they get beautiful at our prayer he was looking to receive something you know they had something and wherever they went if you notice after the holy ghost came upon them wherever they went something happened did this peter just didn't preach his uh inauguration sermon and nothing happened but when he got to preaching this immediate brethren what must we do see the gospel had power in it the break conviction on the people's heart and they got not only convicted they got converted that's what we need we need a gospel that when we preach it men's heart we get pricked because as i heard the pastor said you can't get convicted and still don't get converted but if it's preached right and if the holy ghost quicken it right then it'll bring conviction oh my what an hour we live i'm remembering also elijah i believe was confronted with the prophets of baal and there was 400 against one but a larger new way stood he knew what he had he knew that what god had gave him it will show up and when he met the challenge of that hour and since then brother you're going to face a challenge so we must be prepared for the challenge that we are approaching when you're approaching demon powers epilepsy and all kind of you got to have something you got to know that you know that the god that you're talking about he'll come on the scene because you might can't wait till you get to the doctors you might can't wait till the ambulance come but you can call him on the scene and you can declare lord your word declared that these sons shall follow us somebody say god will show up and heal you out the quickening power yeah i just see a great liking a lot of mechanics a lot of enthusiasm but that's not what you need it's okay to be excited it's okay to be enthused that but get something know what you got we got to know where we standing with god or not i'll be the uh sort of governor saying that the five uh identification of the true the living church is the vindication of power of god we must have it the early church had it the ministry had it that's why they went all over the place preaching the gospel and the word preached them into demonstrate see a lot of people went out with a letter of jesus but when it comes to saying sir we will see jesus that's what the people are longing for they're longing for a living god you say you have a message but then where is god come on don't tell me you got a message and you got no power with it i'm not talking about the written power out of shouting on the same i'm telling a demonstration power that when people come to god they come to church expecting god to do something then god will do it oh no this church here ain't no weak church not god's church that's why you know we got really seek god we got to really you know i mean it takes something i'm understanding the more numbers i'm understanding this we cannot sit around in a message we can't just sit around of the thing god has spoken it's all right listen to that but it got the company please say lord let the very word be manifested in me not just the preacher sister children brother you can do it amen but it's a price not many people want to pay it one of the reasons i believe we're not getting is because we are too loose our walk has become so loose we don't have the time anymore to seek god we don't have that urgency in us they said someone said lord make me desperate don't wait on nobody else you get desperate i'm understanding now very clearly you know i'll say this real really you don't know what comes with certain things until you get in that particular area and then that is saying you understand it better by and by yeah i'm understanding some things by and by getting clearer now understanding that when the people in bondage spiritually speaking bondage demon powers had done come in on the people and got them in such a spiritual condition that it's like they don't even care what uh what's going on with me did they know that they're they're drifting i looked in the words drifting it's a gradually moving away see it don't happen all of a sudden but little by little we drift away from prayer alive we lift we drift away from fasting we don't hardly read our bible until a sudden school if you had a tally up how many hours you put in lord have mercy to be ashamed but there used to be a time we were on fire for god it there used to be a time we didn't wait on nobody else because it wait breaks the wagon down we wait around years come on y'all come on y'all come on and the more you say it did you further away i understand that it gonna take god and only those that have a desire lord i know i need you nobody else in the church might not say it god but i realize that i can't even walk except you hold my hand lord i don't know what tomorrow gonna hold god but i know who holds tomorrow it's gonna take something brother sister to keep us in god in this hour you're not going to get it just by this creeping alone it got to be urgency and i understand this a lot of times sometimes we work ourselves to death pastor sometimes because of the burden they have for souls the burden they have for the people but then it comes to a place and the scripture said save yourself the bible say examine yourself i think that's a good thing all of us need to do go home and examine ourself save yourself we are so running after this with a doubt one and trying to get them in and just writing that right no you got to save yourself you got to get some way and say god i want to be certain i got oil if i got it lord i need more water i need my fire to be burning hard burning burning burning every morning every afternoon every night lord let me burn and nobody else catch on fire lord you catch on fire someone said lord i wish somebody's so lord what we need is somebody if god can illuminate somebody this other day we had a uh new couple came from florence um and both of them you know want to give their life to the lord hopefully we'll be doing a baptism with them real soon but you see the excitement and you don't holly you know when a new convert you know come and they catch a fire or something and the one that just sitting around you know but we need those converts we need those people somehow lord send that last elected wherever they at god and lord let them be hungry and thirsty for you while others may be lingering and until they darling around god there's a work that you still do in god lord put somebody in my path direct me lord to somebody that want you not just church but we need god we've had churches we've had this and but we need the reality lord stir us up again that's what we need we need a power that'll break yokes i understand that we need deliverance since all of this had happened the pandemic in all the mold of the people had been dropped back so where now they don't even really see the need that they need to come to church they think they need more to go and get a better job but those things have seized here see that vanity this lord don't let my eyes look at vanity not saying those things are all right well let me tell you so sister brother you can make it to the mountaintop and what that gonna get you into heaven you can gain this whole world but at the end of the day your soul is saying i'm thirsty i need help can somebody get a breakthrough can somebody do something that to wake me up the bible says paul says stir up the gift that's what we need we need something to stir us up and that's what the holy ghost let me tell you something we always are waiting it always had been a i guess uh a thing that we always wait you know until the preachers our pastor say it because oh i know he got it and i know i see god let me tell yourself god want to use you the same holy ghost the same quickening power that's jubilizing him you are to have it too i know we have drifted delayed the seal spirit and god upon but us believe you said samson the philistines is upon the samson we need to shake ourselves as samson did but he played around with delilah too long and he lost the quickening power oh how he remembered how god used to move and that's what all some of us have i'm saying overall not just here over broad all we can remember how god used to do so god ain't doing that no more sister brother i'm afraid that that's not so i know he done painted that picture but there's a move on there's a spiritual moving on and god is testifying that i haven't lost my power you lost the vision of it because the bible say jesus christ is the same not what are he going to be but his his power is yet the same as it was then how do you know could i have seen it and seeing it taking place it was always good to look back when way back when right no now present tense that's what we ought to see but i know you're gonna take god and servant of god said here he says i'm wondering today that what is happening are we really getting the people to god oh we are just getting them to church we must that's what he said we must get them to christ where this quickening power is it's good to go to church sure if that as far as we go it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but go on to christ see come the church but when you come to church go on to christ do we come to church for anyhow one now see you have to have a purpose that we come in not just as a a ritual or tradition no but we're coming because we're expecting something that's how it used to be with us we we're coming i believe some of us still there we we're looking for something to happen and that's the way we ought to come expecting god lord if not today lord maybe the next day but what god is doing he want to get your desires you must have lord create a desire in me god that i can get this quickening power i'm gonna tell you something for what is coming we don't get prepared now and if you don't get that quicker than power the keeper the one that'll keep you and nothing else can the one that can come and see about you in the midnight hours when nobody else know what you're going through god can come when you're so burdened are so troubled nobody can help you because this is a inner fixing i believe if we get the inside fix right it'll work itself out but we are so interested in the outward and the intimate man is perishing oh my david said like this he said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the why because david knew that if i can get into the presence of god something's gonna happen yeah i'm troubled and i'm going through it and the devil been doing this but if i can get to the house of god lord i know you got a word for me see because god want to meet the needs of the people god knows we need it we need the quickening power all these demons everywhere we impressing against others you can feel these spirits what are they doing trying to suck you in but thank god you got something in you that will shake yourself see sometimes you got to pull back you can't get entangled in all of this nonsense because there's too much stuff going on that ain't of god and that's why the bible said you got to learn to encourage your own self how do you do it feed off the word come on there is something that god got in the word that that'll rejuvenize you i mean the word will quicken your mother body did not the bible say when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord are raised up i don't know where you ever been low in your christian life and you had this breaking point like and then god come by oh i enjoy it's all right to be in the valley and when i get in the valley i know i'm going onto the mountaintop but god give us valley experiences and you will know how to be down but when god raised you up oh that makes me want to shout or the valley come on somebody it's all right to be in the valley cause they know that it's where you'll see god at daniel was in a valley and all you did did not god show up meshach had iraq was in the valley did not god didn't even take him out hallelujah god don't take you out of the trials but he give you something to go through the way you able to say devil i'm putting you under my feet i shall not be moved though the tempt this rages i shall not be moved do a hell assail me brother i will not don't you rock and no you leave but i'm anchored you get an anchor interesting god my soul is anchored my soul is not good i say my soul is anchored in god he's a stabilizer come on he'll keep you when you can't keep yourself that's how you really know that god keeping you because when you get low in his flesh and your back get against the wall and you say lord whatever you're doing in the season god keep me i don't know what to do i don't know lord what i need to do god but i'm going to be still because i know you promised i will never leave you i will never forsake you but i'll be with you until the end god is with us regardless of what we got to deal with come on every one place i'm going that's forward there's no time to run back run back to what crying mama where's somebody down why cry speak see we have must come to a place that we know what we got we got the king sword oh my see we're sitting waiting waiting lord i'm waiting on you no no no no no god said no i i waiting on you because i gave you the promise you think god made known all these uncertain riches for us to sit here and say lord god say no say it's given to you to know what god want done with the word see that's what we have grown up we're not dilly-dallying around and worrying about everything coming in this life here y'all things gonna happen i don't care where you go or what you do they ain't gonna happen but in that hour you must know that's why who david my my prayer always like to say i said lord uh let this word abide in me god you know keep me your word is the only thing god that that can hold me and god let the spirit quicken the word that you're giving us in other words lord make the word come alive in me that i can walk worthy of the gospel that i'm called oh god he said i i like his he said it's good to come the truth but he said go on from the church and get to christ and that's what we got to get the people to understand we are glad for you to come to church but we want you to go into christ though very word see god want that word to be made alive we have heard what god had done in this hour we many of us can uh court it back what's we can say but god that's not what it need to do it need to be made alive because if not we'll be just like any other church yeah because remember israel had a prophet they had a prophet too when moses came on the scene and went to pharaoh and he did those super decided they did it too and see there are people out there i hear uh a testimony of of people's ministers and doing things and i said lord i i said it's simply that they are enjoying our bread the way we ought to be moving the sword of god said we ought to be moving in higher heights in christ you say but what has happened to us we are afraid that it won't work because we are not spiritual inclined to what god wants us to be what he's looking for is a super uh um i'll be in the message we're working on that the stats of a perfect man prophet god said what i'm trying to do here is establish a powerhouse church and he knew it it just can't be the letter of the word the holy ghost has to come and quicken that word and when that word is quicken in you you become a one-man invasion the devil is afraid of you i think that's the main problem while the devil is bothering us like he is because he don't want you to catch it because once you catch it you will tear his kingdom down church that's where we ought to be we are to be that superpower church that god is looking for and i want to say this god gonna have one god gonna have himself that i pray that we like let's see that song i pray we all be ready because this this is our day this is the time where god wants to use us god bless you i appreciate the word tonight it said let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who's being in the form of god thought and not robbery to be of god but made himself of no reputation amen i want to say amen we appreciate the word tonight i that's some things that i wrote down and and i was listening to brother palmer he was going over those things some things i was speaking in mullins last night and he was going over those things and i said this is the season that god wants us to have that kind of mind not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think but he said to think sovereignly you know i think sometimes people think more highly than they ought to think think that they're further up the road than they are and he said not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think and i said lord what happened people are thinking that they're at a hike as brother palmer say people are saying that i'm here i'm here i'm here and he says where's the power where's the vindication so tonight i agree with brother palmer we need to amen not to talk about what we are but are we positionally placed in christ where we need to be and if we are then where is the power amen praise god because it's not in word only but in power god you know i constantly say god is doing more now than he ever did in ministry but people are saying god is doing more yet they seem to be far away from the word and they're saying the same thing i'm saying i said oh god they're saying the same thing but not walking in in the wiring not living what was written but yet they got the same testimony so you can't testify they're going to testify you that's why brother palmer said it would i tend to work the children bread look like they got it and the people that supposed to have it amen the prophet said the the the sickest people is the church it's supposed to be the believer that's the sickest body amen and it ought to be the oh god god bless you i don't want to mess with that god is good amen want to pray for uh brother ernest he's had a religious reaction so he's in the hospital and he'll be out hopefully tomorrow by the grace of god and just lift him up in your prayers and we thank god we're still praying for sister dale and grace and different ones but god is good amen one thing i do know praise god god somebody said he works in mysterious ways oneness to perform you know god can be speaking in a lot of different ways but whether or not we listened to him and said god what are you saying you speaking lord but we got to say here am i lord i hear your voice as i said in mueller's last night i saw his glory and when i saw the glory isaiah said i'm undone i'm unclean i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell among a people that's unclean why because amen he saw god high and lifted up and his twain filled the temple he saw what god was and he saw how undone he was i'm undone god i need help praise god because god was high and lifted up and he saw god's glory you know i don't want to talk too much because i might say i said the glory needs to return to the church praise god people talk about how the glory of god was in the church amen people didn't come in the church any kind of way as brother palmer said because the glory was there praise god people were bringing people and the people come they met because the glory of god was there praise god show me your glory god show me your glory i want to see your glory in the church again praise god something happened i'm getting ahead of myself but i don't want to mess with you thank god for the word let us stand tonight god is good amen brother and he said he's all right just hopefully by the grace of god there beyond tomorrow amen father in jesus name we thank you lord for the word tonight mary there's somebody saying god i want the quickened power i want you lord hallelujah lord god i know it's something
