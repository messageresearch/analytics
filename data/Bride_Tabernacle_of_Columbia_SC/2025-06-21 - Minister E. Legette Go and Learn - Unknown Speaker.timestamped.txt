[36:17] We want to look at the book of Matthew
[36:19] 9. Praise to God. Amen.
[36:23] God is good. Amen.
[36:26] [Music]
[36:30] I feel so much better. Amen. Amen. Since
[36:33] I laid my burdens down.
[36:36] I was telling uh
[36:39] somebody the other day, I said, you
[36:40] know, just when the Lord saved me at 19
[36:43] years old, I I feel just as good today
[36:46] as as I did back then when he saved me.
[36:49] Amen. Through all the ups and downs and
[36:51] all that, I said, I I I feel just as
[36:54] good today as I did back then. Amen.
[36:57] God is good. Matthew 9 and we'll start
[37:00] here at the at the 9th verse.
[37:07] You got it. Say amen. Amen. And it
[37:09] reads, "And as Jesus passed forth from
[37:12] then, he saw a man named Matthew sitting
[37:15] at the receipt of custom. And he said
[37:19] unto him, Follow me." And he arose and
[37:22] followed him. And it came to pass as
[37:24] Jesus sat at meet in the house, behold,
[37:27] many publicans and sinners came and sat
[37:30] down with him and his disciples. And
[37:33] when the Pharisees saw it, they said
[37:36] unto his disciples, "Why is your master
[37:38] with publicans and sinners? But when
[37:41] Jesus heard that, he said unto them,
[37:44] they that behold need not a physician,
[37:47] but they that are sick, but go ye and
[37:50] learn what that meanth. I will have
[37:52] mercy." How many glad the Lord got mercy
[37:54] tonight? And not sacrifice, for I am not
[37:58] come to call the righteous, but sinners
[38:01] to repentance. May God bless your
[38:03] reading of his word.
[38:06] I like that how he says I'll have mercy.
[38:09] Amen.
[38:11] You know uh this little topic here
[38:13] tonight. I want to minister just for
[38:16] quick moment on go and learn. Amen. With
[38:19] a subtopic I will have mercy. You know
[38:22] the thing is here in the scriptures the
[38:25] the uh Pharisees and the scribes of that
[38:29] day you know they were following Jesus
[38:31] around. And you know a lot of times what
[38:35] they were following him around was not
[38:36] that they can learn something or not
[38:38] that they can glean but to find
[38:41] something that they can criticize. Amen.
[38:43] Amen. And you know we know the prophet
[38:45] of God was saying that you know you get
[38:47] what you expect. Amen.
[38:49] you come if you whatever you come
[38:51] looking for that's what you going to
[38:52] get. So if you come looking to criticize
[38:54] and the devil sure going to give you
[38:56] something uh to find to criticize. Amen.
[38:59] But you know that's why we often say it
[39:03] how you touch Jesus made a big
[39:05] difference. Amen. Cuz some a lot of
[39:07] people touched him didn't get nothing.
[39:09] But that woman with the issue when she
[39:11] touched him she got virtue. Amen.
[39:13] something left him because she was
[39:16] expecting something because you know
[39:18] just to just to touch she she understood
[39:21] that Jesus
[39:23] was all he had power in him like no
[39:26] other. Amen. And and not even to touch
[39:28] his arm or or just his bare skin but
[39:30] just piece of the clothing that he
[39:32] wearing it and I know if I can just get
[39:35] to touch that that's what her faith was.
[39:36] Amen. So the problem as we're saying
[39:40] that the Pharisees had following Jesus
[39:42] around, they had a problem with him
[39:44] because he was always seemed to be um
[39:47] mingling and meddling with the people
[39:49] that the church world should not had no
[39:52] association with, right? But that's what
[39:55] Jesus ministry was, right? You know,
[39:58] I've been preaching for a couple of
[39:59] weeks on on spiritual health and and how
[40:02] the church is sick, but I like how Jesus
[40:04] says that, you know, the whole don't
[40:05] need a physician, right? He says, "But
[40:08] he come for the sick, right? That was
[40:10] his ministry." And they couldn't
[40:12] understand it, you know, but in today,
[40:15] even the church world today, you know,
[40:17] the bride is supposed to be an extension
[40:19] of the ministry of Christ. How many
[40:21] believe that? Come on. And so a lot of
[40:24] times, you know, we get caught up in all
[40:26] kind of other things and we're not we're
[40:28] not upholding the ministry, right? But
[40:31] what what is what is Christ what was
[40:33] Christ's ministry? He said, you know, in
[40:36] Luke 4 and 18, he when he came, he said,
[40:39] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[40:41] because he hath anointed me to preach
[40:44] the gospel to the poor." Amen. He hath
[40:48] sent me to heal the brokenhearted.
[40:51] Hallelujah.
[40:52] and and to and to preach deliverance to
[40:55] the captives and recovering sight to the
[40:58] blind to set at liberty them that are
[41:01] bruised. Amen. So what he says, my
[41:04] ministry, God has anointed me to come to
[41:07] the down and out. Amen. He's anointed me
[41:10] to come to those that don't have no
[41:11] hope. Right? And that's where that's
[41:14] where my ministry should be. You know, I
[41:15] was looking at something. Prophet God
[41:17] was saying that, you know, a lot of
[41:18] people profess Christianity, but they
[41:21] never had a burden for lost souls. Amen.
[41:24] Come on. So, how can you profess
[41:26] Christianity or profess to have the Holy
[41:29] Ghost, but you don't have a burden for
[41:30] lost souls? Come on. Not just to pack
[41:33] the church up in numbers just to get the
[41:35] people in, but to see somebody truly
[41:38] converted. Amen. to see God. I I always
[41:42] love to see God just take somebody that
[41:46] don't even have an ounce of religion or
[41:48] God in them, right? And begin working
[41:52] working on them with the little bit that
[41:54] they got. Amen. I heard somebody saying
[41:56] on a song they was saying, "God ain't
[41:58] concerned about what you lost, about
[42:02] what you don't have. All he's wanting is
[42:04] what you got left." Amen. and he'll take
[42:07] what you got left and he'll do something
[42:09] with it. How many believe that tonight?
[42:11] So I thank God for that. That when he
[42:13] when you say it like that, I thank God
[42:16] that see you don't have no respective
[42:18] person. He knows what where you at and
[42:20] what condition you in. He knows where
[42:22] this and that and what condition they're
[42:23] in. He knows what everybody where they
[42:26] at and what condition they're in. But
[42:28] his job, he went out to get them. Amen.
[42:30] Amen. Come on. I like how you know he
[42:33] was walking. You know, Matthew sitting
[42:34] at the seat of custom, but all he did
[42:36] was walk by him and say, "Follow me."
[42:38] Right? And a lot of times, like we say,
[42:41] you got to go out there. When we say go
[42:43] out there and get them, come on. You got
[42:45] to have a burden for lost souls. Right?
[42:47] But what happens in the church world,
[42:49] they don't have a burden, but they have
[42:51] a critical eye, right? Or they have a a
[42:54] a a spirit where they think that they
[42:57] are better than everybody else, right?
[42:59] Oh, I'm glad I'm not like them. But
[43:00] that's the same spirit the Pharisees and
[43:02] the scribes had. And that's why Jesus
[43:04] told them, "Though you think you know
[43:06] what what the ministry is, or though you
[43:08] think you where you ought to be, I want
[43:10] you to go back and learn what the
[43:12] scriptures mean." Right? Come on. That
[43:14] I'll have mercy. See, God was
[43:16] interested. Come on. He He doesn't take
[43:20] pleasure in in uh punishing his people.
[43:22] I don't believe God does. Come on. But
[43:25] he desires his main thing. He desires to
[43:28] have mercy, right? But what happens
[43:31] sometimes his mercy runs out in some
[43:34] lives. Come on. But it ain't that he
[43:37] didn't extend that arm of grace, right?
[43:40] But he extended extended and gave you an
[43:43] opportunity, but the people with a deaf
[43:45] ear turned it away. Right? Come on. So
[43:49] he's telling them, he says, "Go and
[43:51] learn." Come on. I'm so glad that God
[43:53] see that. And that's what it is. the the
[43:56] the bride's ministry is going to be the
[43:58] same ministry that Christ had. See,
[44:00] Jesus, he went out there. Like I said,
[44:02] he went and got them. Went to those
[44:04] places. You know, I was telling the
[44:05] church on uh Sunday, it's something I
[44:08] remember my grandmother telling me some
[44:10] years ago, and she was saying that, you
[44:14] know, uh Brother Simmons when he first
[44:15] came down to Mullins, it what made him
[44:18] different than a lot of the other uh
[44:22] preachers of his time, that that era
[44:24] right there. He says that he spent up
[44:26] time with those boys. She was pointing
[44:29] at some of people that's standing out
[44:31] there in the yard. He see say see he he
[44:33] would see them and he go out there and
[44:35] talk to them. He take up time with them.
[44:37] Right? And she said that's what the
[44:39] difference was. See the thing is a lot
[44:42] of times we only want to take up time
[44:44] with our family or with the people
[44:46] that's around us in the church. Come on.
[44:48] But we got to go go out there the
[44:50] highways and the hedges or we look at
[44:53] situations. You don't know what got a
[44:56] person where they are until you sit down
[44:58] and talk to them for a little bit. Come
[45:00] on. Amen. I always believed that they
[45:03] weren't born in the world in in that,
[45:05] you know, was born in sin, came from the
[45:07] womb, you know, in bad shape, but in the
[45:09] addictions and the troubles and all they
[45:11] had in their life, they weren't born
[45:13] like that, right? But something happened
[45:16] and got them thrown all off. But one
[45:18] thing about Jesus, and I believe that if
[45:20] his spirit is in you, you'd have that
[45:22] same burden. One thing about him was he
[45:25] he had compassion for more than just
[45:29] healing of the sick, but he wanted
[45:30] healing of the soul. Amen. He had
[45:33] compassion for the publicans and the
[45:35] sinners. And I I think sometimes I said,
[45:38] Lord, uh we don't never want to lose
[45:40] that burden. Come on. We always that
[45:43] always because what it is, you look at
[45:45] people and it ain't the people, but it's
[45:48] a spirit that got hold to them. Come on.
[45:50] and they can't see their self. And you
[45:52] couldn't see yourself unless God opened
[45:54] your eyes. Come on. How many believe
[45:57] that? I know that to be the truth. You
[46:00] didn't know until God opened your eyes.
[46:02] But what it was, it was his spirit.
[46:04] Whether he sent your mama, whether he
[46:06] sent your friend, whether he sent the
[46:07] preacher, whatever it does, but it was
[46:09] still his spirit that came by where you
[46:11] were at. Amen. Amen. Come on. Amen. He
[46:15] met you right where I I I can talk from
[46:18] experience for myself. He met me right
[46:20] where I was at. Come on. Amen.
[46:22] Hallelujah.
[46:24] And he ain't never left me yet.
[46:25] Hallelujah. Amen. He met me right where
[46:28] I was at. Come on. And dealt with me
[46:30] right at the stage that I was on. Come
[46:32] on. Amen. Amen. And begin to let me know
[46:34] right then that he still loved me.
[46:36] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. And that he want
[46:38] to turn my life around. But I got to let
[46:41] him turn it around now. Come on. He
[46:43] wasn't going to force me. Yes. But he
[46:45] when he come and that's what it is when
[46:48] you when you out witnessing things of
[46:50] people, you tell them all the time that
[46:52] you know, come on, God is God and he
[46:54] never changed. His power is still the
[46:57] same. Amen. Come on. That the ministry
[47:00] uh Luke 4:18 like it says that ministry
[47:02] ain't over. He's still doing the same
[47:04] thing today. Come on. If you got bru if
[47:07] you're bruised, he's healing bruises.
[47:09] Come on. Your broken heart, he's mending
[47:12] broken hearts. If you bound up in
[47:14] chains, he's setting free the captive.
[47:17] He's still doing that. Why? Because he's
[47:19] still alive, ain't he? His spirit is
[47:21] still here. But the church world
[47:23] sometimes forget that. Come on. But God
[47:26] got to remind us. Oh, like we said, he
[47:28] came by you where you were at. Amen. And
[47:31] got you. God to remind you of that
[47:33] sometime. Come on. God to remind you.
[47:37] Hallelujah. When you was hopeless. Come
[47:40] on. Amen. When you had addictions that
[47:43] you couldn't break, come on. When you
[47:46] had everybody against you, bless. Come
[47:49] on. Talking down to you, not believing
[47:52] that you was ever going to be nothing.
[47:55] Right there where you were at, his
[47:56] spirit moved right around here in where
[47:58] you were at. Hallelujah. Amen. And he he
[48:01] caught your attention. Why? Because you
[48:03] were already predestinated. Come on. He
[48:05] didn't see you how you were then, but he
[48:08] saw you how you were going to be.
[48:09] Hallelujah.
[48:10] Amen. And he knew that you were his
[48:12] seed. So he came by and he got you. And
[48:15] and through all of what you had against
[48:18] you, come on. And so that's what I'm
[48:20] saying. When God take you back and you
[48:22] see that, Hallelujah. then you want to
[48:25] present that hope to somebody else that
[48:28] all that you got against you, come on.
[48:31] All that I had against me, somehow I
[48:35] made it through. Hallelujah. Somehow
[48:37] after all I had against me. Amen. I was
[48:40] able to battle throughout all of that.
[48:42] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Amen. Come on. I
[48:46] was listening to that song last night. I
[48:48] had it on repeat about my soul is
[48:50] anchored. Amen. That's what it is.
[48:53] That's why I was sharing. I says, you
[48:54] know, with someone I says, out of all
[48:57] that way back then, everybody thought it
[49:00] was going to pass, you just a phase he
[49:02] going through. I'm just a stirred now.
[49:04] And I'm in love with God even more now.
[49:07] Come on. than I can say I was back then
[49:09] because he's brought me through more.
[49:10] Hallelujah. And when you look at the
[49:13] blessings that God has blessed you with.
[49:15] Don't talk about what you don't God.
[49:17] Look, don't have look at what God has
[49:19] blessed you with. Come on. Amen. Oh
[49:22] Jesus. Amen. Blessings. He didn't have
[49:24] to hand out. Hallelujah. But he loved
[49:27] you. Lord, he came by where you were at.
[49:30] He took up time with you. And just
[49:32] because you were faithful, hallelujah,
[49:35] God started blessing you.
[49:37] Amen. Hallelujah. And when you thought
[49:39] God was was done, he started blessing
[49:40] you again. Come on. But you love God
[49:44] because of what he done for you. How
[49:45] many love God tonight? But that's what
[49:47] it is. Your love for God, come on.
[49:49] Grows. Come on. Your love for God got to
[49:53] continue growing, right? But what it is,
[49:56] what it is, I says, is that people have
[49:58] spirit. They got a spirit on. The world
[50:00] got a spirit on it, right? Come on. And
[50:02] they can't help it. The way out of
[50:03] seeing age, the world got a spirit on
[50:05] it. Amen. Everybody, they cannot they
[50:08] can be in real bad shape, not have
[50:10] nothing, but yet they'll tell you they
[50:12] don't have need of nothing. Come on. Not
[50:15] even God himself, but they can't help it
[50:17] because of the spirit that's on this
[50:19] age. Come on. That's why he says to come
[50:22] unto me and bow messelves, right? Come
[50:24] on. Amen. That I might uh let me anoint
[50:27] your eyes. Right. Come on. He wants you
[50:30] to come unto him, right? And he what he
[50:33] does when he anoints your eyes. Come on.
[50:37] Then he opens your eyes to the condition
[50:39] you in that hey I need help. Come on. I
[50:42] ain't going to make it without you God.
[50:43] That's right. Come on. It open your eyes
[50:46] and say Lord I need you in the morning.
[50:48] I need you in the evening. God I need
[50:50] you. And when your eyes is opening you
[50:52] don't never stop that need for God.
[50:55] Every day you wake up you say I need
[50:56] God. Come on.
[50:59] Every hour you say I need God. Right.
[51:02] And you do. Come on. Don't ever think I
[51:06] was praying. I said, "Lord, what it is,
[51:08] you know, you got to always walk in the
[51:11] in a level of humility."
[51:13] You got to always keep it upon yourself.
[51:16] Lord, don't let me think of me to be no
[51:18] higher than I am. Amen. But God, let me
[51:22] always walk humble in your sight. You
[51:24] got to have that prayer now. Amen. Come
[51:26] on. Amen. You got to have that prayer
[51:29] that God whatever I was I was saying
[51:32] Lord when we ministering the gospel we
[51:35] can get up. What's the use in preaching
[51:38] if if your spirit ain't there to direct?
[51:40] Hallelujah.
[51:42] If the anointing isn't there to meet the
[51:44] needs of the people
[51:46] if it ain't come by to to just drop
[51:49] something in somebody's spirit that that
[51:51] they'll know that God heard you.
[51:53] Hallelujah.
[51:55] God knows what you're dealing with. The
[51:58] preacher didn't know. God knew it.
[52:00] Right. Come on. And he dropped something
[52:02] to let you know that you all done a
[52:04] little while longer. Hallelujah. Oh,
[52:07] Jesus. I'm about to turn some situations
[52:10] around. I believe that. Do you believe
[52:12] that? Oh, I believe it with all my heart
[52:14] that God is getting ready to turn some
[52:16] situations around. Come on. Amen. Oh,
[52:19] Jesus. Amen. Well, we got to let God do
[52:21] it, right? Come on. He's not uh brute
[52:23] like that, but he he's when when he
[52:25] comes. So I says, you know what it is?
[52:27] It's a spirit, ain't it? You know, I was
[52:29] thinking um I was saying uh uh last last
[52:33] night me and somebody people was
[52:34] talking. We've been talking all week.
[52:36] What it is,
[52:38] you know, this world has gone insane. We
[52:41] say it all the time, but it's actually
[52:44] gone insane, right? We were looking at
[52:46] videos and of Iran shooting rockets just
[52:51] recklessly, 50, 60 at a time, no
[52:55] intended targets, hitting cities,
[52:57] hitting whatever they can hit. I said,
[53:00] you know, and we watching those rockets
[53:02] just coming in. I said, can you imagine
[53:05] having to deal with that? Come on. But
[53:08] what it is over here, we ain't had to
[53:10] deal with that. Hallelujah. So people be
[53:13] at ease, don't they? Come on. I was
[53:16] looking at, you know, uh, Iran was
[53:19] saying that that they they pray they
[53:21] prepping for strikes possibly on air
[53:23] bases over there or bases over there,
[53:25] American bases. And then somebody was
[53:27] showing a video of what the soldiers
[53:28] over there doing on the bases over there
[53:30] playing around like ain't nothing going
[53:32] on. Come on. No sense of urgency, you
[53:36] know. And I thought about that same
[53:38] thing how at in in uh Pearl Harbor World
[53:41] War II. They knew the Japanese was going
[53:43] to attack, but was know they they went
[53:45] out drinking, partying, just doing
[53:47] whatever they normally do the night
[53:49] before, even though they know it could
[53:51] be attack at any time. Come on. And when
[53:53] the attack came on, we wasn't ready. Why
[53:56] wasn't you ready? The handwriting was on
[53:57] the wall. The trumpet had sounded. Come
[54:00] on. The warning signs had went out. Why
[54:03] didn't Why wasn't you ready? But the
[54:05] same thing spiritually speaking in the
[54:07] church, the handwriting is on the wall
[54:09] now. You think the people desperate?
[54:12] Come on. Bless. You think the people uh
[54:15] uh stirred?
[54:18] Come on. To get down on their knees and
[54:19] pray and check themselves. Lord, search
[54:22] me. Try me. Come on. Oh Jesus. I was
[54:27] praying. I said, "Lord, as thinking
[54:30] about Samson, he said, Lord, once more."
[54:32] Come on. You know, the prophet of God
[54:35] was talking about when you look at look
[54:36] when they looked at him, he still looked
[54:38] the same. The framework was still there.
[54:40] The hair had even started growing back.
[54:42] But it was one thing, the power was
[54:44] gone. Come on. And if you look at the
[54:47] church today, sometimes, come on, the
[54:50] buildings are there, the people are
[54:51] there, but it's something wrong.
[54:54] Come on. And if you tell them that, they
[54:57] get mad with you. Come on. But they
[55:00] won't be mad when the real storm comes.
[55:03] Oh Jesus. Amen.
[55:06] So true. The handwriting is on the wall.
[55:09] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Time is now wound
[55:11] up. Come on. I said, "Lord, I want to be
[55:14] ready when you come." Hallelujah. Oh,
[55:17] Jesus. You know, I was telling uh uh
[55:21] somebody I says there we was talking
[55:23] about those rockets hitting. They was
[55:24] like, "Man, I I don't know." He says
[55:27] America ain't ready for nothing like
[55:28] that cuz Israel got tunnels. So they set
[55:30] the sirens off and they go on the ground
[55:32] to protect themselves from the rocket
[55:35] that's coming. America say they ain't
[55:37] ready for nothing like that. I says the
[55:39] thing about it is
[55:41] something like that. Only thing that's
[55:43] going to that's going to uh uh uh take
[55:46] care of you and something like that is
[55:48] going to have to be the spirit of God.
[55:49] Hallelujah. Come on. How many believe
[55:51] that? Your only hope is safety.
[55:55] Come on. even in the world today is in
[55:57] God himself. Amen. Not church.
[56:00] Hallelujah. Not just jumping and
[56:02] shouting or professing to be a
[56:04] Christianity, but you got to have the
[56:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Come
[56:08] on. Something that a nuclear bomb can't
[56:11] touch. Oh Jesus. Come on. Something
[56:14] that'll warn you what's up ahead. Right.
[56:17] What's up ahead? When men miss all the
[56:19] signs, I believe it. The Holy Ghost
[56:23] warns us. Amen. Come on. Everybody
[56:26] sitting around. You might not see it,
[56:28] but God is warning you by his spirit.
[56:30] Something is getting ready to happen.
[56:32] Come on. Oh, Jesus. Amen. And you can
[56:36] feel it. Hallelujah. And what side are
[56:39] you on this morning tonight? Hallelujah.
[56:41] But I says that God Come on. I says,
[56:44] he's telling them to go and learn. Come
[56:46] on. Because they thought they knew, but
[56:47] they they didn't. Did they missed the
[56:50] simple things? But I says in all of that
[56:53] and all that uh uh taking place and and
[56:55] all that I says, are you ready tonight?
[56:59] Come on.
[57:02] Are you ready? Hallelujah. For the
[57:04] oncoming storms. I was listen, as I was
[57:07] saying earlier, I was listening to that
[57:08] song, My Soul is anchored. I like a
[57:11] little a little verse. I kind of made
[57:13] part of it up myself, but I says, you
[57:16] know, uh, even if the storms don't
[57:21] cease, come on. And if the wind, cuz
[57:24] he's saying that, keep on blowing. Come
[57:27] on. I throw that other part in there. I

[58:05] God will keep his promise. Oh Jesus.
[58:09] Hallelujah. And that's where your eyes
[58:11] got to stay uh uh settled at. How many
[58:14] believe that tonight? Come on. But the
[58:16] world is gone. See, that's the thing
[58:17] about it. Jesus, like it says, he come
[58:20] that the the uh uh uh save the lost to
[58:23] the sick, right? Uh uh to to heal them.
[58:25] He that's why he told him, "Go and learn
[58:28] what that mean. I'll have mercy." He was
[58:30] desiring to have mercy. Show people
[58:32] where they were, right? Come on. And he
[58:35] was desiring that today. He's still
[58:37] desiring that same thing today. But I
[58:39] was talking last night and and we was uh
[58:42] talking about some situations. I said,
[58:43] "You know, the world, like we said, has
[58:46] gone completely insane." We was talking
[58:47] about a certain situation and a friend
[58:50] of mine at the job, he said, "Ernest,
[58:52] but you know, that's acceptable now,
[58:54] right?" I said, "It's still not
[58:57] acceptable no matter who say it is."
[58:59] Amen. Come on. It It'll never be
[59:01] acceptable. Not in the sight of God.
[59:04] Hallelujah. I says, "But you know, uh,
[59:07] we was talking about in the in the '9s."
[59:10] I said, "In the '9s, if you had did
[59:12] that, everybody would have looked at you
[59:15] like you was mentally something. You had
[59:17] mental issues. Come on. That's how they
[59:21] would have looked at you with this
[59:22] certain situation." I said, "But now
[59:25] they don't they don't even like it's
[59:26] normal." I said, "What is it?" It's not
[59:29] still not normal. It's a mental issue.
[59:32] Come on. It's a spirit. There's demons.
[59:35] Come on. Hallelujah.
[59:38] But they don't know because they they
[59:40] blinded by the God of this this this
[59:43] age, right? Come on. But that's why we
[59:47] don't look at them certain ways, but we
[59:49] say, "God,
[59:50] come on. Have mercy." Amen. And not
[59:53] sacrifice. Come on. Amen. Oh Jesus. Give
[59:56] me the right prayer that I can pray and
[59:58] you can go by and do something in their
[1:00:00] life. Because I got a burden for their
[1:00:03] soul, God. I don't even know what got
[1:00:06] them in the shape they're in. Amen. But
[1:00:09] I'm burdened to see them like that.
[1:00:10] Hallelujah. And they think they all
[1:00:12] right. That's why you can't talk to
[1:00:14] them. Come on. Amen. But you can still
[1:00:17] pray. Come on. Hallelujah. You can still
[1:00:20] pray and pull down strongholds. How many
[1:00:22] believe that tonight? Come on. And
[1:00:24] that's what I say is God. Come on. A lot
[1:00:26] of times what happens? Come on. God open
[1:00:29] a little door or crisis will come in
[1:00:33] somebody life. God open a little door
[1:00:35] and you go in there. Come on. But what
[1:00:37] it is, see the thing is the Pharisees
[1:00:39] don't know how to didn't know how to uh
[1:00:41] handle those open doors. Amen. Come on.
[1:00:44] They was concerned more with the rituals
[1:00:47] in the letter of the law. Come on. Than

[1:01:01] that sigh and cry about the abomination
[1:01:03] done in the city. Sometimes we got to
[1:01:05] get back. What's the ministry? Come on.
[1:01:08] When you don't have a burden for lost
[1:01:09] souls, prophet God was saying that's
[1:01:11] that's a bad place, right? And he said
[1:01:13] people profess Christianity and never
[1:01:15] had it. Come on. Oh Jesus. Never desired
[1:01:19] to see somebody. Come on. Or still don't
[1:01:23] desire that today to see God change
[1:01:25] somebody's life. see God take them off
[1:01:29] of these drugs and alcohol. Come on.
[1:01:32] Break spirits powers on their life. I
[1:01:35] don't know about you, but I I got a
[1:01:37] burden for somebody. Hallelujah.
[1:01:39] Come on. Oh, Jesus. Hallelujah. You
[1:01:43] know, I was thinking about my dad. I can
[1:01:46] say it. I tell my dad, my dad told me,
[1:01:48] he said, you know, one thing of when he
[1:01:51] was going through his time, he said he
[1:01:53] average service, you know, he was in the
[1:01:55] shape he was in. He came to church and
[1:01:57] he says he get in the prayer line and
[1:02:00] he's saying the pastor was brother
[1:02:02] Simmons at the time said he'd pray for
[1:02:04] him just as hard as if it was his first
[1:02:06] time coming. Never turned them away.
[1:02:09] Come on. But what it was one day God did
[1:02:13] something. Come on. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:17] Come on. Amen. And is he still that same

[1:02:28] still saving?
[1:02:30] Come on. Do you believe God is still
[1:02:33] mending? He's still healing. Come on.
[1:02:36] Natural healing will be all right. But
[1:02:38] if you your soul ain't right, we talking
[1:02:40] about spiritual things. Come on. Do you
[1:02:43] believe that God is still breaking
[1:02:44] yolks?

[1:02:51] forget about them. Hallelujah. Amen. God
[1:02:54] is still working. Amen. Come on. But who
[1:02:56] is going to cry out? Amen. Who's going
[1:02:59] to call out? Who's going to bring them
[1:03:01] on the scene? Oh, Jesus. Who is going to
[1:03:04] have a burden for their children? Come
[1:03:06] on. For their loved ones, for their
[1:03:09] brothers, for their sisters. Come on.
[1:03:11] And go to God and say, "Lord, you
[1:03:13] promise." Hallelujah. This is what you
[1:03:15] said. I can't do it. The world is in
[1:03:18] such shape it's going to take you, God.
[1:03:21] Oh, Jesus. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Come
[1:03:25] on. Oh, Jesus. You got to remind him,
[1:03:28] Lord, you said I'll have mercy. Amen.

[1:03:40] to want to go deeper in God. Amen. Come
[1:03:43] on. Amen. Her desire. Hallelujah. To see
[1:03:47] God in the manifestation of his power.
[1:03:50] I was sharing with a friend of mine,
[1:03:52] Muslim friend of mine. He was saying, I
[1:03:55] says, "The thing is, you know, the the
[1:03:58] gospel, I said, it's got to, you know, I
[1:04:01] want a gospel that's that's can do
[1:04:03] something for me, right? More than just
[1:04:05] make you turn a new leaf or give you
[1:04:07] good principles to live by, but it's got
[1:04:09] to have power in it." Come on. The
[1:04:11] things that you're saying you can't
[1:04:13] overcome, it's one thing about the
[1:04:15] spirit of God. Hallelujah. The gospel,
[1:04:18] it's got power in it. the things I say I
[1:04:20] couldn't overcome. After I done all I
[1:04:22] can do, he took up the rest. Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] Come on. And he took the He changed my
[1:04:28] appetite. He did all those things. It
[1:04:30] wasn't me, but it was in how much I can
[1:04:32] let go and let God do it. Right. Come
[1:04:34] on. That's what how much you tell people
[1:04:37] all the time, it ain't about you. You
[1:04:38] trying and God like your efforts. You
[1:04:41] taking that one step. Come on. And he'll
[1:04:44] take two, but you got to let go.
[1:04:46] Hallelujah. God, I desire I desire your
[1:04:50] spirit. I desire to walk upright in your
[1:04:53] sight. I desire to do the things that's
[1:04:56] pleasing unto you. Come on. Is that your
[1:04:58] desire tonight? Come on. And as you
[1:05:00] desire that, little by little, watch
[1:05:02] God. Come on. Oh, Jesus. Begin to move
[1:05:05] in you in that way. Begin to taking
[1:05:07] things and move. And then you realize,
[1:05:09] come on. It wasn't ever since I laid my
[1:05:11] burdens. It wasn't hard. It was easy
[1:05:13] letting go and letting God have his way.
[1:05:16] It was hard for me trying to carry it.
[1:05:18] But when I let go and let God have it,
[1:05:20] it became easy. That's why it says to
[1:05:22] take my yoke upon you and learn of me.
[1:05:25] Come on. Amen. Oh Jesus. For my my yoke
[1:05:29] is easy, but my burden is what? Light.
[1:05:32] Like I said, after all all you had to
[1:05:34] battle through, come on. It was easy
[1:05:36] because God did it for you. How many
[1:05:38] believe that tonight? Somebody give the
[1:05:39] Lord a hand clap of praise.
[1:05:42] I know. God is good. Amen. I had a a few
[1:05:47] little things I wanted to say, but you
[1:05:48] know, I just for the sake of time, I
[1:05:51] says, you know, the the handwriting is
[1:05:53] on the wall. Amen. Come on.
[1:05:57] It's on the wall.
[1:06:00] We closer now than we ever been.
[1:06:04] Right. Are you stirred?
[1:06:08] Come on. Is your spirit stirred?
[1:06:12] Come on. Are you are you prepping to get
[1:06:14] out of here? Come on. A lot of times
[1:06:18] say, "Oh, you got you know he got to
[1:06:19] live like it's he going to be 20 years."
[1:06:22] And that's true. But don't don't say
[1:06:24] that too much
[1:06:26] and you don't prep at all. Come on. I
[1:06:30] don't know about you brothers and
[1:06:32] sisters, but I want to be ready. Amen.
[1:06:34] Come on. at any time. I was sharing with
[1:06:37] them at work. You know, I was saying,
[1:06:38] you know, the Bible talked about the
[1:06:41] three woes and the two already happened,
[1:06:44] but I said that third one was supposed
[1:06:46] to come shortly. I said, but that third
[1:06:48] one ain't going to be nothing like these
[1:06:49] first two. Those first two, it won't
[1:06:52] even last long. Not when they start
[1:06:55] throwing nuclear weapons.
[1:06:59] And the thing is, you know, people got
[1:07:01] faith in politics and all. Come on. All
[1:07:05] men are liars. Come on.
[1:07:08] A man without God to do anything. That's
[1:07:11] one of my grandmas saying. He said, "A
[1:07:13] man that don't fear God to do anything."
[1:07:15] Come on. But your trust got to be
[1:07:18] totally in God. How many believe that
[1:07:21] tonight? Come on. Look to him. Like I
[1:07:24] says, he's got one thing I I was
[1:07:26] sharing. I was talking to Charlotte. I'm
[1:07:28] closing. Was talking to Charlotte. says,
[1:07:30] "I I'm starting to, you know, as as you
[1:07:33] go through in the Christian journey, you
[1:07:36] start learning lessons. Come on. You
[1:07:39] learning lessons and God is his spirit
[1:07:42] teaching you, but you you learning it
[1:07:45] and you growing, but then you start, you
[1:07:47] know, uh, looking to God for more more
[1:07:51] now than anything." Come on. I was
[1:07:54] telling the guy cuz he was saying, you
[1:07:57] know, Ernest, he says, "Everybody keep
[1:07:59] calling me young, but I'm 32 years old.
[1:08:01] I'm old now." I said, "The thing is, we
[1:08:04] was laughing about it." I says, "You
[1:08:06] know, you can be 50 and 60 years old and
[1:08:10] still hadn't learned the lessons of life
[1:08:12] yet."
[1:08:13] I says, "But the character, what you
[1:08:16] make up, what's made up, it's been
[1:08:18] because of the things that you went
[1:08:19] through." Come on. And I says that you
[1:08:22] know we find that in our lives. Come on.
[1:08:25] You you learn lessons and then like I
[1:08:27] said you start looking to God for more.
[1:08:30] You start looking. You don't just make
[1:08:32] decisions just do things or whatever.
[1:08:35] And even if you are about to and he and
[1:08:37] the Holy Ghost quicken you. You stop and
[1:08:39] you pray and say let's seek God about
[1:08:41] it. And if you don't have a sure answer
[1:08:43] you learn from the times past and leave
[1:08:45] it alone.
[1:08:46] Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] because you don't want to have to deal
[1:08:51] with what you already dealt. You want to
[1:08:52] go like we say every round go higher.
[1:08:54] You want to go higher in God, right? So
[1:08:57] you start looking to him for everything.
[1:09:01] And that's why it says we got to look to
[1:09:03] God and God will show you. But are you
[1:09:05] looking? Come on. He's speaking, but
[1:09:07] who's listening? Come on. His spirit is
[1:09:10] doing something, but who's listening?
[1:09:13] Hallelujah.
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:27] Praise God. Amen. Amen. You sin last
[1:09:30] night
[1:09:32] concerning the world falling apart.
[1:09:34] Amen.
[1:09:35] And you can't believe the devil's lie.
[1:09:40] You got to realize the devil is a liar
[1:09:43] and he'll keep lying to you as long as
[1:09:46] you
[1:09:47] are believing it.
[1:09:49] But when you stop believing the devil's
[1:09:51] lie,
[1:09:53] you'll turn your heart to the Lord.
[1:09:57] Eve believed the devil's lie and we got
[1:10:00] all of us in bad shape
[1:10:03] cuz the devil deceived her.
[1:10:06] I said don't believe the devil's lie.
[1:10:09] He's been lying to you.
[1:10:12] He'll tell you a lie and have you
[1:10:15] repeating his lie. Amen. And believe in
[1:10:18] his lie.
[1:10:22] That you can wait till tomorrow.
[1:10:25] And the Bible tells us tomorrow is not
[1:10:27] promised.
[1:10:29] The day you hear my voice, he said, "Ha
[1:10:31] not your heart." Amen. For today is the
[1:10:34] day of salvation. Amen.
[1:10:36] You can believe the devil's lie
[1:10:40] and believe that you got time
[1:10:43] time to get right.
[1:10:46] Amen. But when God call
[1:10:51] when God call you,
[1:10:53] time would wind up.
[1:10:56] And God is calling
[1:11:00] somebody tonight.
[1:11:03] God is speaking to some heart tonight.
[1:11:05] Amen.
[1:11:07] If you only yield to him,
[1:11:11] surrender to
[1:11:13] the Lord, not my will,
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] he can change you.
[1:11:19] He can deliver you. He's able to set you
[1:11:23] free.
[1:11:27] As we see the world falling apart,
[1:11:31] we see
[1:11:33] the world fell apart in the first
[1:11:37] advent and the Analuvian world when the
[1:11:40] world was
[1:11:43] over flooded
[1:11:46] and the rains fell in the days of Noah.
[1:11:51] We saw the condition of man heart
[1:11:56] imagination and thought of man heart was
[1:11:58] continually evil.
[1:12:01] And God said he repented me that I made
[1:12:03] man.
[1:12:05] God will look down now at the church
[1:12:08] world and at our conditions tonight.
[1:12:12] Would God be pleased with us tonight?
[1:12:16] Will God say I'm pleased?
[1:12:20] You're not pleased then. And I don't
[1:12:22] believe it's pleased now.
[1:12:25] It's time to get right with God.
[1:12:29] It's time to surrender your life.
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:36] We see the corruption
[1:12:39] of politics,
[1:12:41] the corruption of religion,
[1:12:44] the whole world system is corrupt.
[1:12:48] We see the moral decay.
[1:12:52] We see the political decay
[1:12:57] and we see the religious
[1:13:00] life
[1:13:01] decay.
[1:13:04] The world has
[1:13:06] come to its end.
[1:13:10] There's no turning around for the world.
[1:13:15] But you have your opportunity.
[1:13:19] The world has gone too far to come back
[1:13:23] to God.
[1:13:25] But you have your opportunity. Nation
[1:13:29] will not return.
[1:13:31] The world would not repent,
[1:13:35] but you can repent.
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:38] You can say yes to the Lord. Amen. You
[1:13:41] can say, Lord, you can make a difference
[1:13:44] in my life. Yes, God. You can change
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:52] my wretched condition.
[1:13:56] I want
[1:13:58] Jesus to come
[1:14:01] into my heart
[1:14:04] as we stand today.
[1:14:07] Thank God for the word.
[1:14:10] He'll meet you where you're at.
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:16] And he's not coming to criticize you.
[1:14:19] He's coming to help you.
[1:14:21] He'll meet you there.
[1:14:25] Yes,
[1:14:29] I can hear Sister Irene saying,
[1:14:33] "Where you're running, center,
[1:14:36] you can't hide, center, you can't hide.
[1:14:41] Where you running?
[1:14:44] You can't hide.
[1:14:46] We need to run to God.
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:53] Hallelujah. As I head to about heart to
[1:14:57] look into it,
[1:14:59] I wonder tonight.
[1:15:03] Is there a place
[1:15:06] of repentance in you?
[1:15:09] Can you find place?
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:14] Do you feel the need of repentance?
[1:15:18] A need of God. A deeper walk, closer
[1:15:22] walk.
[1:15:26] Do you see that need?
[1:15:29] Will you take heed to the need tonight?
[1:15:33] For God is calling someone tonight.
[1:15:38] It's just not a coincidence, but God
[1:15:41] calls.
[1:15:44] Will you answer the call?
[1:15:48] With our heads are bowed, hearts are
[1:15:49] looking to him. Has God spoke to you? Do
[1:15:52] you see a need? If there's a room today
[1:15:56] for God to come in, thank you. Thank
[1:15:59] you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,
[1:16:02] Lord. There's room. Come in. Thank you.
[1:16:05] Thank you. I invite you in, Lord. I I
[1:16:09] want to empty out. I want you to fill me
[1:16:11] up,
[1:16:13] Lord. I want to surrender my my all to
[1:16:16] you, Lord. I haven't been giving you
[1:16:18] all, but here I am, Lord. I want you to
[1:16:21] have all of me.
