him to let you come i said okay i'm going up there and the security guard he said i'll take you up there so he took me all the way into intensive care to the room and he stood down there and i was praying for elegy she greased my hand she tried to talk but they had this thing in her and just tried to talk and the security guard said his eye's about to pop out his head he said where your church is he said i'll be there sunday and he was there suddenly because he saw what the lord did for her are you with me i said god is good it's good to have a mother that cares somebody to believe that pride changed this thing hallelujah thank god amen to see her here now knowing what god has done amen god is good amen so many times the sister may shack would stand at the altar for her children and grandchildren and she would tell the problems you that they were going through i want you to pray and i said the prize we're going to miss that praise god but i it's just like my mama passed but her prayers god still heard her prayers she might have been gone a long time but god still was answering prayer are you with me it's good to have somebody that stood in the gap praise god somebody who's offered up sacrifice amen praise god for us job was offering up sacrifices for his children praise god he said perhaps they had sinned or done something wrong but i'ma offer up sacrifice to god for them praise god it's good to have grandparents and parents that will pray for you praise god when we were going astray we're going in our own way mama prayed grandmama prayed amen so we thank god for our sister amen that believed in prayer and we know that if it wasn't for prayer amen i was thinking about dd god's so good to dede amen i said god let us stay around here where she can be with her children amen god is good ain't that right it's because grandmama cared amen so by the grace of god i i i don't know how to start but let me just go and get into the word for a few moments and try to encourage you amen he said put your time in sister wonderful said because payday is coming after a while amen and i want you to put your time in because payday is coming out the world whatever you're doing is not worth losing your soul amen because if you put she believed that's why she it didn't matter cove it didn't matter what i'm going to church she was putting her time in i'm coming it doesn't matter if she wasn't feeling good or whatever i'm coming to church amen she put a time in i believe god recognized faithfulness it's how you feel about god you want god to feel good about you but how do you feel about god you you i don't care or the biggest sinners or or whatever they do amen when it comes down to dying and having a funeral everybody going to heaven you know that ain't right the bible said broad is the way that leading to destruction there's going to be many straight and narrow to get the leader to righteousness everybody that died don't go to heaven matter of fact i told them amen the heaven i was talking about the seven dimensions and and and jesus amen god is up in the seventh when when a saint die he goes into the sixth dimension that's why the bible said the dead in christ shall rise first and we that alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air amen there's going to be a rapture and then we go into the seventh dimension but right now they go into a resting place amen somewhat like a paradise someone like abraham bosom but it become a time where we can go and sit at the marriage supper of the lamb and sit down and amen and i'm gonna say welcome home amen so here in uh first corinthians 15 and 50 it reads let's just bow for a moment father in jesus name may you bless this family comfort their hearts strengthen each and every one lord bless your word now in jesus name amen now this i say brethren the flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold i show you a mystery we should not all sleep but we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be what change oh ain't got bobolda well we shall be changed isn't that right we shall be changed i'm talking about that's what i want to talk to you about being changed amen we shall be changed remember you know the old timers would say in the bible says as a tree fall that's the way it's gonna lie don't don't don't die in your sin and actually want to go to heaven because jesus made a way for you to get out of sin when he died on the cross and shedded his precious blood he had made provision for you to accept him and as your savior and that he died in your place so you don't have to die and be lost uh uh can i say that word you don't have to die and go to hell are you up man are you with me but you can die right you can amen you can fall right when you go down right you can rise right but you go down wrong don't expect to come up right but you know the story that folks tell you like you can die wrong and lit and rise and you're gonna be a saint all of a sudden uh hi you know and we're looking at all these great people that's dying and uh maybe movie stars and maybe football basketball or all these great people that folks admire but when no folk die amen they they wasn't serving the lord they wasn't trying to get to church and getting god's house amen but they died and everybody said well thank the lord they're going to heaven now you know what i'm saying if you don't enjoy god right now on this side how you think you would get into heaven all of a sudden you're going to enjoy jesus you got to enjoy somebody say i want to go with jesus here no you don't if you want to go where jesus is you will go now why are you here why are you living amen what i mean because remember the attitude that you have now that's the attitude that you have when you wake up in the morning if you don't want him now you wouldn't want him then because you're not gonna wake up all of a sudden i want to live for you god no you didn't want to live for him then when you get up you ain't getting up another whole another new person you're getting up just like you went down amen and when you get up you're gonna have to face god and and folks said well i thought everybody no everybody don't go to heaven i know what happened lord you asked god to forgive you of your sin you're going to help oh come on amen that is right but it's got to be something that's coming from the heart and and god recognizing that and you meaning it with your heart that you want to change and god will give you that ability to change god will give you the ability amen for what you really want god to do for you if you believe god will do it for you then why ask god to do something you don't want him to do a lot of people ask god god i want you to save me but you don't want to be saved you want to live like a devil and you want god to save you and live like you won't say i'm saved yeah you're saved from what see when we're saved we're saved from sin are you with me that's what he saved you for the life that we used to live that's what he saves us from he don't save us to keep on doing the same thing and talking about we saved god gives us a new life i said we shall be changed that's what i'm talking we shall be changed and and if we're going to be changed in the future we got to want to be changing now if we don't want to be changed now i mean you know how can we believe the devil and all he takes us through we're going to believe his lie that i that he can give us something better than god got for us the one that made us amen he knows what's best for us but but sometimes we just we're just convinced that the devil oh i'm having a good time i'm having a ball amen i need a drink i need a you know i need this i need god you know oftentimes i say god promises to apply all of our needs not all of our wants and what we want we don't need and what we need we don't want them are you with me so uh oftentimes we miss the blessings of god because we think amen what we have is so good that we don't want to give it up amen and that's what the problem is what uh jesus said on one occasion what prophet a man to gain the whole world and to lose his soul are you up there so you don't want to amen engage in this life in sin and in the things of this world amen and lose out on heaven praise god if you want to go to heaven jesus i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also and then if you're going to prepare a place you've got to get prepared to go to that place amen if you get prepared this is your dressing room as my old bishop used to say this is your dressing room you're dressing up for where you want to go are you a man so if you dress up amen and put on the right put on the whole arm of god put on righteousness put on holiness put on sanctification put on this new man this new man amen and and god wants you to see you recreated in christ jesus unto good works where you can live in peace and in the love of god radiates from you and you can feel that love that he really cares for you amen and he's done a work in your life amen gives you the peace and the love amen because some folks are scared of god as a little guard don't do them on some crazy something you know people are scared to come to church they're scared amen they let jesus in he knocks on the door of their heart they say oh no why because they're scared that they might change and we shall be changed but they're scared of change amen because they're so used to the life that they're living until they're fearful because they don't know what to expect amen but if we oh are you with me but you can expect god to do you good amen and god to bless your life and give you more than you could ever imagine amen the bible said he he do for us more than we can actually think god will bless us in such a mighty way you wish that i would have gave jesus my life a long time ago amen i gave him my life a long time ago and i'm not disappointed amen praise god i thank god as a young man that god came by and i was willing to say yes lord and god is giving you this opportunity amen the change has to be made now it don't make it's no change you're going to make when you go in the grave and when you die you ain't ain't no changing now amen you've already made your decision and i'm saying you can make your decision what amen that you're gonna believe jesus or you're gonna keep on believing the devil lie that i you know i'm this and i'm that don't let the devil fool you and don't let these lion preachers tell you lies there's so many lion preachers people go to a church of convenience go to a preacher that's gonna tell them lies and they're gonna feel good and it won't make no changes in their life because they don't have to change because the preacher is the lion preacher are you a man so they go to the church where the preacher telling lies nobody got ain't nobody good nobody writing nobody perfect they want to they want to hear that nobody perfect god will forgive you y'all god will but god is expecting amen if he didn't say be holy as i'm holy and he said be your perfect as your father which is in heavenly spirit then god must make revision for you to be like that amen god can sanctify you he can clean your life up if you want to be clean are you with me i can't uh i got to stop ain't got good that's the kind of preaching that sister may say that's the kind of preaching she listened to i said god loves every one of y'all grandchildren god love you great grands god love you glad to see y'all beautiful faces amen but she stood in the gap that you can make a honest decision that god loves you better than she loves you and she would want you to give jesus christ your life but i'm not just saying that because i'm trying to work with your emotion i believe it with my heart that she would want you to serve the lord because he knew she knows the results that payday is coming after a while and one day we you know i thought it's three o'clock the other mornings before sister may say passed away i got up and i started writing this message we shall be changed i told my wife i said somebody's getting ready to die and she said i just didn't know at the time who it was and i says well this is the message and i held it back for a few days and then we got the sister may shack pass and i said well i thought about many things three o'clock that morning i got up sat at the table and i started writing the things that i was thinking about i said mustard was god was just getting me ready to talk to y'all and tell y'all amen since the may check at the end of the road she steps got shot she got weak but she knew that god promised if our earthly house of this tabernacle were to be done that we have another building not made with hand god got a better place a better house to live in she trusted that god had something better god would give her a new body a body with no more pain no more sickness no more sorrow no more disappointments a lot of times we have to go through those things brother and sister i trust the same god that she trusted that god got a better place that he prepared for us that's why john said i saw a new heaven and a newer for the first heaven and first effort passed away and there was no mercy and as john saw the new jerusalem i believe that it's in view brother and sister god has a home and one day he said welcome home amen to those that prepared themselves to go to this place where the streets are paid with gold praise god so all the money that you get don't mean nothing god got a mansion waiting on you if you can only believe it and receive god's peace god's love the one that shed his precious blood and died for your sins god bless you let us by his father in jesus name [Music] jesus you said that i am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father except he come by me father you prepared a place for those that would believe you and trust you i trusted somebody here today would say that one day i want to hear you say well done good and faithful servant enter into the joy of the lord brother and sister friends you have a decision to make i believe our sister may shack made a decision one day and when she made that decision nothing could stop her she was gonna serve the lord in spite of all that goes on around her and all that goes on she made a decision i choose jesus you can make that decision today by choosing jesus and allow him to come into your heart if you believe that he died for your sins oh he's saying we confess our sins he's faithful and just if you can hear his voice heart not your heart will that be one as our heads of our hearts are looking to brother simmons pray for me i want to accept jesus will there be one that will lift your hands to pray for me thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank y'all oh thank you all of you praise god father you see all the hands hearts that are open and lord i know you welcome your love into their hearts and all i know this sins is though there may be many god i know that you died for all of them and your blood was shedded to wash them white in the snow father i prayed it this day would be a day of a new beginning father your love would come down into their hearts and lord that you'll make him a new creature in christ bless every hand every heart that's opened the day that they receive you as their personal savior let us say together lord jesus come into my heart and lord i forgive me of my sin and i welcome you now in jesus christ's name amen amen i love him amen josh praise god god is good the bible says repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost if you have not been baptized in water in the name of the lord jesus christ but you have accepted him as your personal savior then if you need to know more i'd like to share that with you
