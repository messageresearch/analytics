[Applause] and god it's good amen say happy mother's day to all the mothers amen god bless you this morning we just want to read a scripture and uh honor the mothers this morning and proverbs 31 and 10 proverbs 31 and 10. and then we're going to get unless you stand and we'll read together proverbs 31 god is good amen won't be long and we'll be leaving here proverbs 31 and 10 i'll read the first you read the next and we read the last verse together it says who can find a virtuous woman for a price is far above rubies 11. she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life 13. she is like a merchant ship she brings her food from a 4 15. she considered the field and bite it and with the fruit of her hand she planted a vineyard 17. she perceived that her merchandise is good her counter goes not out by night 19. she stretches out her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her hand to the needy 21. she make it herself covering of tappery her clothes is still in purple 23. she make it fine linen and sell it and delivered girls until the merchants 25. she opened her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness 27. her children arise up and call her blessed a husband also and he that he praises her 29 favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised together give her the fruit of her hand and her own works should praise her in the gate hey god bless the reading of his word you may receive it amen for sometimes the day like today mother's day we can reflect black and we can think about the mothers that are going on and mothers that are here we're grateful i said i i told sister patricia i should have said to all the mothers to bring their children this morning she said yeah you wouldn't have a room enough in the church form i said well we'll try to if the lord will spare us another mother's day tell them bring your children amen and your grands so we thank god for all the mothers and again we thank god again for you that pressure way those that are listening in you know mothers that are listening to them we thank god for you thank god for i thought about it i didn't get a chance to call my jared i didn't get a chance to call mother john this morning and when trini died but i trusted the message to get to her happy mother's day to sister oja trinidad amen she's in her 80s and and she's always been a blessing over the years so god bless you this morning here and on ii peter 3 and 10 it says but the day of the lord second peter 3 and 10 it says but the day of the lord cometh as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall be shall passed away with the great noise and the elements shall melt with the fervent heat there the earth also in the works that are they in shall be burned off what i was looking at brothers and sisters that look like we don't hear a whole lot of good news now look like we all be in touched by the violence and the troubles of this world and i can hear that song soon we will be done with the troubles of this world amen it's going to be it's troubled times and we're living in such a troubled time and uh my subject was dealing with we were touching a little bit in mullins on thursday night about the new jerusalem so we were talking about uh on the new jerusalem what god has in store for you and i and i want to talk about the new heaven in the new earth amen so god is promised to you and i a new heaven and a new earth in this troubled world we're not going to look for things to get better but things are going to get worse and worse so but we just got to keep pressing our way in a troubled world we got to keep on keep looking up because god got better things in store for you and i so he says and i'm backing up a little bit in this third chapter backing up a little bit and uh looking at the my heart is really heavy because i i came to mullins the other night and they was telling me uh brother marshall was telling me he says oh young man just got killed you know by the police and about every week he was telling me so and someone got killed someone got killed you know so we'll we well you know a tragic time a time where you got to be on the lurk you got to be watchful amen you got to be prayerful and even at that it's just the grace of god it's keeping us just the grace of god that's keeping each and every one of us and sometimes we see the angle you know i look at it and i see where the devil is taking the world you know i see the tattoos all over the people's arms all over the head and in the face and everywhere they can pierce themselves they're piercing themselves every little spot on them their arms and legs they just tattooing themselves up i don't know they're making themselves look i mean you look at it and i don't know what they're looking at when they look in the mirror people's hair going all kind of way you know nappy head or looking they're looking horrible but someone's saying this is cool people looking so bad but but when you see somebody pleasant with a nice haircut a nice uh groom a young lady looking nice and you know it's just looking pleasant you know and something about people that are pleasant people today just looking like a young lady you know that's you know i'm saying you don't see that often that a young lady would want to look like a young lady and a a young fellow a young man would want to look you know kind of neat dress and clean and you know just like a gentleman you don't have to see that anymore but i want to say to your mothers that have children that's respectable and that you're trying your best to you know point them in the right direction i want to commend you for your effort and what you do it does make a difference in the school and the job everywhere when you got mothers and sometimes even at your best i know some of the mothers have done a tremendous good job but when children get a certain age they just rebel against because there's a pool out there there's a pull out there in the world and it's it's strong it's real strong but i want to say to you mothers be encouraged you did your best and get a good job but be encouraged to god that you keep looking to god because god can turn things around for you are you with me now there are others that are not instructed like they don't hear the word they don't see the need but as we prepared for heaven the world is preparing for the the lake of fire so they are preparing for where they are going and the devil is he's put he's putting his he's putting his mark upon them he's putting his mark he's putting his imprint in their life that's why they're tattooing himself they putting all kind of piercing he's putting his mark he's he's in putting his influence on upon their lives he's making them look like what it's going to look like if you crossed over into the region of the laws he's actually in printing he's mocking them and putting his small he's saying you belong to me and when you look in the mirror you see that image you see that monk the mark of the beast the mark of the antichrist the mark of the false prophet you see that image you looking at so they are saying don't i look good until a christian our eyes are saying why would anybody want to do that to themselves why do they want to look like that and it's you know looks hideous sometimes people but that's just so how far is too far and how far will we go my cousin in philly he was saying he said he was showing us around philadelphia a couple of months ago or some months ago and he said it's a place in philly you don't want to go because those people in that area they all look like zombies they look like you know the walking dead they say you don't want to go to that place and one of the brothers that was giving this testimony he says it's free they give them free drugs and all they just stay high and that's it's like that how would you want a life do you want a life like that you know you want a life where the devil is dragging you he's pulling you she's in such a course of dreadfulness and the bible said before the great and dreadful day he would send you elijah the prophet but there's a dreadful day up ahead let me just try to back up to the third version of just a second peter and i'm going to encourage you this morning i i wanted to preach and i was stirred but let me talk to you for a moment amen because we are living in trouble times difficult times and people are being pulled that's why the women cutting their hair off and the men let their head go along because there's a pull there's a pull against the word the bible says it's a shame for a man to have long hair and the woman wants she said okay if and if a woman have a hair's given to her for covering and if she has long hair it's a glory to her are you with me so what what it is we we're fighting against the word we're rebelling against the word that's why the women they cut their hair that's why the men they let their hair grow along what it is it's it's a battle going on it's a wall who's going to win you who's going to win you god is not going to put pressure on you he's just going to love you he's just going to just say i love you because i love you come to me and the devil i'm going to put pressure no no come my way so there's a wall going on battling battling for your soul battling for your mind that's a wall the greatest about ever fought is fought for your mind the devil is trying to take your mind amen not knowing the other night i was preaching on a little bit in mullins about a sound mind having a sound mind god has not given us the spirit of fear but of love and a power and of a sound mind so god gives us not the spirit of fear amen but god you love him and you want to serve him you want to worship him you want to give him your life because he cares for you he loves you amen god wants you ain't meant to experience his goodness his grace is love it's peace it's joy it's waiting on you but we don't want to just receive it because the devil he has some strongholds he has power strength i said god i was talking to michael and rachel and different and jarry knows i said i said devil got a stronghold amen i said we got to do more we got to be more persistent we got to persevere before god and stand in the gap for these young people because the devil is he's got a stronghold he's trying to take him straight into the picture hell but if we don't stand in the gap and really pray and really cry out to god but i thank god for a mother that prayed for me amen they prayed that god would open my eyes because i was blind one day too but my mother stood in the gap and she talked to me and told me god i want god to open your eyes son because you can see all the fault going on in the church but you need god for yourself you know you know that's a good mother a mother that will tell you amen you need an experience with god you need god and when god opened my eyes it didn't matter what other folks did in the church i wasn't talking about what they did and what somebody else because you know i understood what mama was saying you need you need god yourself look at you you need god and uh and that's that's the thing amen as individuals is it's you and god you need god i think i thank god that my eyes was open before i got too far down that road are you with me because you can get down that road and you can go through some stuff you can go through some um oh some harbor things down that road things that you wish you would never experience places you wish you would never win but you thought i could go and i can come out all right they meant most people go they don't come out all right and some folks that can't return but they think you know you know how we think when you're young you can do it and you're going to come back to serve the lord later you know we think that we think that we you know you know you know other folks did it i'm going to try to and i'm going but it don't work brothers and sisters don't work for everybody some people have a little grace and mercy and god allows it other people have to go through some strongholds and before they early this morning i was you know i think it was time to get up almost five something or something like that and i got up i mean i woke up and i said let me just try to rest a little longer today and then i said okay i couldn't just laid there for a minute and all of a sudden i started dreaming and in the dream it was a man uh uh looked like i thought that he had you know he was kind of lost his mind somehow this ambulance or some type of vehicle had stopped and they had this individual man that they were trying to contain some kind of way but he was just standing there and they were standing on the side they said we put all kind of tranquilizers in him and we put all kind of we tried to drug him with everything we could and um it didn't do no good it had no effect on it and the man reminded me of brother ojob from trinidad that past and he looked at me and it was a group of us standing around he looked at me he said you i said me he said yeah he said come here i wasn't afraid because you know god blessed us we pray for people that stephen possessed and god delivered him and you know i'm thinking you know well and then he said when i came forth he looked me in the eyes and i looked at him and he said the things that you've been going through and he started telling me about what i've been going through and some said this man ain't crazy he's a prophet i said oh he's a prophet and he began to share with me he said don't worry about it don't worry about it it's good for you the things that you go through is good for you i said oh okay and i was encouraged you know so i told my wife those this morning i said it's almost like a vision he said it's good for you and he told me one other thing he said you praying for people that don't want it you're praying for people that don't want to be saved i said oh i said i told my wife you're praying for people that don't want to be saved i said oh okay i just and i said i said i can't remember exactly what because it all happened so fast but it was so real because the first thing this person is supposed to be lost in mind they start telling me what i was going to hit it right now this person ain't crazy and i realized that was a prophet i don't know what it mean i didn't know i didn't think i was gonna share it this morning but i shared it anyway by the grace of god i don't know sometimes it's a blessing to you you know to hear what we go through god allows it and it's good for you even though you don't think it's good for you it's good the things you go through it's good for you but we think oh no where am i going through this god got a way of working it out to your good and i was sharing with marlins i just wrote some things down it says we worship the gift not the giver and the all good and perfect gifts come from above do you want god or his blessings do you want god or his blessings love what he gives us but don't love him we love what he gives us but don't love him and i was thinking about mother's day she's for better for worse in a marriage because the church is the bride of jesus christ for better or for worse love the better the good times the sunshine but we don't want the rain not knowing that the rain is good for us are you with me you know all the good days all the good times but sometimes it takes the bad times to make us enjoy it good times sometimes it takes the sickness to make us in thankful women well are you with me sometimes it takes your hurt and pain they meant to enjoy when the hurt and pain is going away it takes oh god and god is good amen hopefully i can get back to peter here but uh i i'm talking to you i can i'm not preaching this morning now but god is good i i want you to know in spite of what you go through amen give god thanks hallelujah stay in your place stay in your position stay in christ because that's the safest place you can be in christ the safest place you can be is be a christian that's your position amen that's where god will bless you in your position amen that's where heavenly places are in christ you stay in christ you're in heavenly places amen do we talk about adoption are we talking about praise god god bringing you into adoption god how do you know we're having places that if you're in christ that's where heavenly places is oh god hallelujah a new heaven a new earth amen i'm talking about a new heaven and a new earth and brother and sister we got promises from god amen for a christian we have promises from god god has made the promises to you and i and those promises that god made with us amen we can rest assure that god is faithful god is faithful and god keeps his promises amen hallelujah rather go and sing one day well amen one day we're going with jesus going for a ride in the sky amen isn't that right it says here it says in ii peter 3 and 3 knowing this first that there should come in the last days scoffers walking after their own unless are you with me saying where's the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continued as a word from the beginning of creation i'm gonna tell you people they're not worrying about his coming they're not thinking that he's coming by me tell you something we put god on the back burner we don't believe he's coming soon amen but those that are conscious those that are spiritually conscious and not going to sleep those that are awakened they believe that it could happen anytime that we are in an urgent hour we you know a time that amen anything can happen at any time now i was listening to the news thinking on yesterday they said we were closer they was talking about the debate between russia and america and they saying that what's what's happening now that america was bragging because they helped sink one of russia's most powerful ships you know and they helped do this and helped said america was bragging about that and the president the president trying to tell them stop stop doing that because y'all making things worse the tension between russia and the united states is getting to the point that you you y'all supposed to keep that undercover whatever you're doing but y'all bringing it out and bragging on it he said don't don't do that i'm telling you really in a time where it's getting very tense you push somebody say you push a cat in the corner he coming out are you a fan so you pushing people in a corner and you don't want you think they ain't gonna respond they got no choice but to respond so i'm saying to us amen we can bolster our might and both of our but god god got scriptures stripped your promises concerning gog and magog and what they would do are you with me so russia is in the scripture their position in the bible america amen it's in scripture in the bible are you up man so we we we're at the end time we're here we have a ride but how do we handle it how do we deal with it do we believe it or uh or have we come so uh numb to it that it don't even mean nothing no more amen the word don't don't it don't even phase us don't even touch us no more i believe we're living in a dangerous hour where the world is not effective anymore in people's lives they're here but they it bounces off amen like water off a duck's back are you with me but instead of receiving amen they they they're just listening amen have people hearts become so hard amen have their ears to come so dull they meant that they can't even hear the word no more it won't penetrate it won't go deep enough it won't stir them anymore brother and sister where are we it's a time of trouble it says where's the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continued as a word since the beginning of creation we don't know whether jesus is coming brothers and sisters the signs of the times are here the signs of the times are here we we have arrived praise god and what the prophet said that seven vision was russia above in the united states are you with me and the women was being ravished are you with me could it be possible that that thing can happen any day now but he said before the bombs fall the church will be raptured the bride of jesus christ will be raptured are you with me but who has bleeded our report we see the signs russia was a two in the hand of god like connecticut nazar because israel had went away from god so god let amen almost like an ungodly he the nation come and destroy jerusalem are you with me won't god this christian nation amen supposed to love god and god will bring judgment on the nation because of the sins of the nation which is supposed to be godliness amen a christian nation but god allows those folks that don't say the atheists don't even believe in god but yet god will let allow them to judge this country this nation brother and sister are we going to be ready to get out of here are we preparing oh amen we're safe and secure we don't believe anything gonna happen don't got comfortable but brothers and sisters it ain't a time to sit back and relax and so we're comfortable it's time to get ready and prepare to get out of here i'll tell you something the signs of the times have arrived brother it says let me go back it says in the ninth verse it says the lord is not slack concerning his promises and some men do count slightness but it's long suffering not willing it's long suffering towards us not willing that what and it's your purge but the what that's a thing that's the thing come to repentance where the people repent we try everything we can do to reverse roe versus wave or whatever but is that what we trying to do they trying to stop abortion too late it's too late they're gonna do it anyway why because the people have come more and more they they it's more we got bigger issues than that the issue of sin amen we got bigger issues than abortion we got a bigger issues than that praise god we got bigger issues than the racial tension and all that we got bigger issues amen look like our bigger issues is the mental state of the people praise god the mental state the people that are being battled in the mind the mental illness people have gone actually mad well a sister can walk down the street with no clothes or and not know they're naked are you up it's something that the folks have just lost it all praise god they just they just it's just gone there's no morals no decency at all we got bigger issues people are not ashamed they want to show it all are you with me we got bigger things because even the people don't know what which way to turn what they are they're looking for something and they don't know what they're looking for it's gone men don't know what a man is a woman don't know what a woman is we don't know where we are we're confused and god is not the art of confusion praise god hey somewhere there's got to be a place that we can go and find peace a place that even we can go and find the answer to what we're
