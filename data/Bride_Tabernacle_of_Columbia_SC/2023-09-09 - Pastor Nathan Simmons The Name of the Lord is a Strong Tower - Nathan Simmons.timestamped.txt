[38:10] understanding teaching if one of us
[38:14] Genesis level chapter
[38:25] the first verse
[38:26] in the whole earth
[38:28] was one language
[38:31] and of one speech
[38:35] you may be seated
[38:37] and it came to pass at the journey from
[38:41] the East
[38:43] that they found a plane in the land of
[38:47] Shawna
[38:48] and they drailed there
[38:51] perhaps some of you know my uh Kelly
[38:53] you're my reading started the third
[38:55] verse
[38:59] amen
[39:00] and we want to talk about amen
[39:05] a safe place
[39:09] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[39:12] the right should run in there in their
[39:14] what
[39:15] we'll see we don't brother
[39:18] and they said one to another go to let
[39:22] us make break and earn them thoroughly
[39:24] and they have brick for stone and slime
[39:27] had they from water yeah
[39:30] and they said go
[39:32] to let us build us a city in a town let
[39:35] us build us a city and a tower who's
[39:38] taught me reaching to Heaven I think
[39:40] that's what happened in this last days
[39:43] everybody want to build a Mercedes
[39:45] and everybody want to build on my tower
[39:48] is that's right
[39:50] every Church
[39:53] want to build their own Tower you know
[39:57] and let us make a name unless we be
[40:00] scattered let us make a name
[40:03] amen
[40:05] people want a name for themselves
[40:08] you know
[40:11] and be unless we be scattered abroad
[40:13] upon the face of the whole Earth
[40:15] and the Lord came down to see the city
[40:18] in the tower which the children of men
[40:20] build it see me as a building this Tower
[40:23] not God
[40:24] we don't
[40:27] and the Lord said behold the people is
[40:30] one and they have all one language and
[40:34] this they begin to do and now nothing
[40:37] will be restrained from them which they
[40:40] have imagined to do amen we don't go to
[40:44] let us go down and there confound their
[40:48] language that they may not understand
[40:51] one another's speech
[40:53] so the Lord scattered them abroad from
[40:55] thence upon the face of all the Earth
[40:57] and they left off to build the city
[41:01] therefore is the name of it called Babel
[41:03] Babel because the Lord did it there
[41:06] confound the language of all the Earth
[41:09] and from thence did the Lord scattered
[41:12] them abroad upon the face of all the
[41:15] Earth that's good
[41:16] let's go to Proverbs 18 chapter in the
[41:20] 10th verse
[41:22] amen and we see here
[41:25] nimrod desire to build a towel
[41:29] to reach under heaven
[41:31] and God came down and confound
[41:34] the language
[41:36] read on
[41:39] Proverbs 18 and 10.
[41:42] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[41:44] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[41:46] and the righteous runeth in to it
[41:50] innocence
[41:51] we're talking about building a tower

[45:04] and let you know what what kind of mind
[45:07] I hate
[45:09] my mind
[45:11] was not like an ordinary kid
[45:14] I thank God she
[45:16] one of my old friend to come up with low
[45:19] fear
[45:22] the Lord I call them brother some
[45:24] correct me the Lord she called me
[45:27] pancake
[45:30] ain't nothing wrong with that
[45:33] years ago loafer
[45:36] working for me on the paper route
[45:39] I'm going way back
[45:42] and I hope I ain't said nothing to
[45:44] defend her
[45:51] she was one of my first paper girls
[45:57] I had
[45:58] a young kid
[46:00] 14 years old
[46:03] I had grown I had people working for me
[46:08] I'm making three and four hundred
[46:10] dollars a week that's a lot of money for
[46:11] that day
[46:13] but what I'm saying here I have my own
[46:16] thing I was doing
[46:20] many of you want to build something
[46:25] but you want to do it without God
[46:29] never I want to build it
[46:31] but they want to do it on his way
[46:36] I want to build it my way
[46:39] and maybe you are here tonight want to
[46:42] build you something
[46:46] yeah I could probably could have been
[46:47] rich
[46:49] possibility
[46:52] but I've chosen
[46:55] to leave Columbia South Carolina
[46:58] to go to Mother South Carolina
[47:01] did I find out what life was about
[47:04] there
[47:06] I learned
[47:09] to depend not on me
[47:13] or what I could do
[47:17] I learned something that I want to learn
[47:19] in Colombia
[47:22] I learned how to be Pope
[47:25] I learned how to not behave
[47:30] it's helped me the greatest lesson it
[47:33] build character in there
[47:36] because you can go out here and you can
[47:39] build a great name for yourself and you
[47:42] could do it in vain
[47:45] young people
[47:47] when I was 11 years old like some of
[47:50] these young boys and 11 years old I was
[47:52] already
[47:53] Dynamite
[47:57] I already was a hustler
[48:01] I didn't wait till I got 15.
[48:05] maybe I was the only one in my family
[48:07] was like that I don't know
[48:10] but I want to tell you tonight
[48:13] if you don't put God first you'll be
[48:16] your own child like never wrong
[48:22] you don't know what it means
[48:25] to go out here and want to be somebody
[48:28] the Bible said a poor oppressed to pull
[48:31] it like sweeping rain
[48:36] trying to get up there louder
[48:38] trying to be something Society
[48:43] many of you come to church
[48:48] but you may have the wrong reason why
[48:50] you're here
[48:52] you may have your own objective what you
[48:55] want to be some of y'all might want to
[48:57] be Beyonce
[49:00] some of y'all young girls
[49:03] you'll never make it
[49:08] you'll never be a Browner
[49:12] some of y'all might want to be Jay-Z
[49:14] you'll never make it
[49:19] once God put that Christian thought in
[49:22] your mind as a child
[49:26] once God put
[49:28] you maybe said here
[49:31] but it's something that God can put in
[49:33] you you can't get rid of
[49:36] and he planted the sea
[49:40] in the club I couldn't get rid of it
[49:43] I done a pool table
[49:45] or whatever I did I could not erase
[49:48] Christ out of my life he was deadly
[49:51] state
[49:56] you can build your own Tower
[50:00] you can do your own thing
[50:04] but if you want to get hold of Christ
[50:05] tonight
[50:09] we was in the world we used to hear a
[50:11] song
[50:13] Jerry Butler used to say you'll help
[50:15] young man messing up the minds of a lot
[50:18] of pretty girls but brother you got to
[50:20] face one fact all the hardest you give
[50:22] out it will come back
[50:26] you're a pretty young girl that's not
[50:28] the mind of a lot of young men but girl
[50:31] you got to face one fact
[50:33] oh the honey you give out you're gonna
[50:35] get them back and the Bible just pray
[50:37] that I just here be not deceived God is
[50:41] Not mob whatever you sow you will read
[50:48] coming to Christ
[50:51] me and my brother at the Electric
[50:53] Warehouse
[50:57] he ain't not here tonight one of me and
[50:59] my brother and I was at the left let the
[51:01] warehouse when God called me
[51:04] I was not in church I had no intention
[51:08] of being Church
[51:10] I was intend to party
[51:14] I had no intention to give my life to
[51:16] God
[51:19] no intention
[51:21] I'm headed to California me kid and we
[51:24] and Nathan and Roger
[51:27] I'm going to make me some money honey
[51:37] that's why I was headed for money money
[51:39] money
[51:40] not a little bit of money
[51:43] much as I can
[51:45] so I heard their words again the whole
[51:47] world and lose your soul
[51:50] you could build your own Tower
[51:54] many of you here
[51:57] do not even have a revelation what I'm
[51:59] talking about
[52:02] I want to be so
[52:04] because when you is nobody your whole
[52:06] objective in life is I'm a Visa
[52:10] and I'm gonna I'm not gonna do it the
[52:12] right way I'm gonna do it my way
[52:15] you're never wrong God came down
[52:19] Nimrod was a mighty Hunter
[52:24] storm
[52:29] like Donald Trump
[52:33] yeah y'all know familiar with Donald
[52:35] Trump you might not be familiar with
[52:37] Hitler and Mussolini and a lot of other
[52:39] great leaders of the era but y'all
[52:42] coming for me with Donald Trump he'd do
[52:44] it his way
[52:47] unaware bizarre way
[52:51] if you don't get the mind of Christ
[52:52] you're gonna do it your way
[52:56] unfortunately every black man will live
[52:58] to be for 25 years old
[53:01] the average when I was in the street the
[53:03] average black girl would not survive

[1:33:49] praise God
[1:33:52] I wonder tonight
[1:33:55] if you will if you want it
[1:33:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:01] tonight
[1:34:03] if you can create an atmosphere in your
[1:34:06] spirit
[1:34:10] he said how do I create an atmosphere
[1:34:14] there's an atlas fear you create for
[1:34:16] healing
[1:34:18] it's just how bad you want it
[1:34:23] we know that God
[1:34:27] can't come in a place that he's not
[1:34:29] welcome
[1:34:32] but we must welcome him
[1:34:35] because he's not going to force himself
[1:34:37] in
[1:34:40] so he said whosoever will let him come
[1:34:44] are you with me
[1:34:46] you got to be willing that I want Jesus
[1:34:49] to come
[1:34:51] and fill me with his love
[1:34:54] because that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:55] it's the love of God
[1:35:00] it's something about the presence of God
[1:35:03] what you start surrendering and yielding
[1:35:05] then his presence just come
[1:35:09] you feel that presence of his Spirit
[1:35:13] began to Hoover over you
[1:35:19] and he wants to not just hover over you
[1:35:23] he wants to dwell in you
[1:35:28] let us by our heads as we
[1:35:30] yield and surrender to him
[1:35:35] the Bible says if
[1:35:37] we confess our faults he's faithful and
[1:35:40] just the forgiveness
[1:35:44] tonight
[1:35:46] we just acknowledge
[1:35:49] Lord
[1:35:53] I've sinned I've done wrong things
[1:35:57] not live like I should live
[1:36:02] Lord I heard the word you spoke to me
[1:36:08] Lord I know the word was for me Lord
[1:36:12] and I want God
[1:36:15] I don't want to be like
[1:36:19] like I see myself now
[1:36:23] in my heart I want to be a Christian
[1:36:27] I want to live for God I want to I I
[1:36:29] want to be saved
