[48:43] ready amen
[48:45] uh
[48:46] proverbs says and all i get and get
[48:48] understanding
[48:50] amen he said my people hosea said my
[48:53] people are destroyed because of lack of
[48:55] what
[48:56] knowledge not only do they like
[48:58] knowledge but they reject knowledge
[49:00] the bible said when jesus came unto his
[49:02] own but his own received them not
[49:05] and and isaiah said who shall believe
[49:08] our reporting to whom is the arm of the
[49:10] lord reveal
[49:12] amen you know if god don't reveal
[49:14] himself to you as an individual than you
[49:17] blind
[49:18] but when god has mercy on you to reveal
[49:22] his word to you amen then you can see
[49:25] who you are
[49:26] wait amen the devil will make you out of
[49:29] anything and everything amen but once
[49:32] amen god revealed to you you're just not
[49:35] somebody just out here just living and
[49:37] doing it you have a purpose god has a
[49:39] plan for your life

[49:47] amen to be his sons and daughters are
[49:49] you look man
[49:51] amen because there's a difference amen
[49:53] the rest of the world just live any kind
[49:55] of way because they don't know amen they
[49:58] don't know no better
[49:59] that's why jesus when they were killing
[50:01] him said forgive him amen because they
[50:03] don't know what they're doing
[50:05] so a lot of times you don't look down on
[50:07] the center amen they don't know what
[50:10] they're doing and they're doing all kind
[50:11] of stuff because they don't know what
[50:13] they're doing
[50:15] when they reject god and they're blind
[50:17] they don't know what they're doing but
[50:19] now you got understanding
[50:22] oh you look there
[50:24] but they don't know no better and you
[50:26] getting upset with a sinner because he's
[50:28] a sinner and they don't even know no
[50:30] better
[50:32] you know you ever seen the parent a
[50:34] parent a little child little baby or
[50:37] maybe one or two years old and the
[50:40] parents cursing the child out and just
[50:43] going on at the child and the child just
[50:45] looking and crying and they just started
[50:48] cursing and going on and the child like
[50:51] the child has grown up and understands
[50:54] you know what i'm saying and i and i
[50:56] looked down i said po
[50:58] excuse for a mother
[51:00] amen look what she's doing to that
[51:02] little child
[51:03] amen knowing that this child amen maybe
[51:06] that child might do a little something
[51:08] wrong but it's not worthy of that being
[51:10] cursed out like that
[51:13] and sometimes we uh people
[51:16] they lost it
[51:18] are you a man
[51:19] instead of you know trying to explain to
[51:22] the child and correct the child in a
[51:24] nice and loving way amen and so what
[51:27] happens to the child eventually the
[51:29] child amen is going to do the same thing
[51:32] if they have a child what how their
[51:35] parents treated them they're going to
[51:37] treat their children like that and it's
[51:39] only going to get worse and worse
[51:42] are you up man
[51:46] child being okay
[51:48] uh 29 and 11
[51:53] isaiah 29 and 11.
[51:56] i i just read the ninth verse it says
[51:58] stay yourself
[52:00] one and
[52:01] cry ye out
[52:03] and cry
[52:05] they are drunken
[52:06] but
[52:07] not with what
[52:10] they stagger
[52:11] but not with what
[52:14] for the lord has poured out upon them
[52:16] the spirit of a what
[52:18] how you
[52:20] see people are drunken
[52:22] and god has pulled out upon them the
[52:24] spirit of a deep sleep
[52:26] people are sleeping they not only are
[52:28] they sleeping they have a deep sleep
[52:31] amen
[52:33] the reason why they were drunken look at
[52:36] uh isaiah uh uh 29 and one he said eric
[52:41] eric
[52:42] the city of david that dwell and
[52:47] year

[52:53] and in other words god is saying
[52:56] yet i will distress
[52:58] erie
[53:03] and there
[53:04] there shall be
[53:06] heaviness and sorrow
[53:08] and it shall be upon me unto area
[53:14] and i will camp against
[53:17] the roundabout
[53:19] and will lay siege against thee
[53:22] with
[53:24] a mount
[53:25] and i will
[53:28] raise forts against thee
[53:32] and thou shalt be brought down
[53:35] thou shalt
[53:37] speak out of the ground
[53:40] and what
[53:44] and the voice shall be what
[53:51] and the speech shall
[53:56] and moreover the multitude of thou what
[54:02] and the multitude
[54:10] okay
[54:12] thou shall be visit of the lord of hosts
[54:16] with thunder
[54:18] and with what
[54:20] and great what
[54:23] with the storm and tempest get get your
[54:27] mic kill and the flame to divide the
[54:31] fire are you with me
[54:33] and the multitude of all nations
[54:37] that fight against aryans
[54:40] and all that fight against her
[54:43] [Music]
[54:44] and
[54:44] [Music]
[54:46] what
[54:49] and what
[54:52] shall what
[54:57] and i shall even what
[55:01] that that's all right that's good that's
[55:03] good
[55:04] what i want to get to is the people of
[55:07] israel and ephraim amen they had
[55:10] rebelled against god
[55:13] and god they weren't listening to god so
[55:15] god had no other choice
[55:17] amen but to pull upon them those those
[55:21] that weren't listening to the prophets
[55:23] wasn't listening to the word god pulled
[55:25] upon them a deep sleep
[55:28] oh you look man
[55:30] because they wasn't listening god gave
[55:31] them a space and sent them prophets and
[55:34] sent them the word but they wasn't
[55:35] listening to the word no more
[55:38] so god give them the spirit like a drunk
[55:40] man a deep sleep you know uh y'all ever
[55:43] seen somebody that got so drunk and then
[55:45] they just fall out and you try to wake
[55:48] them up you you it's hard to wake up
[55:51] when they're in that deep sleep and been
[55:52] drunken are you with me
[55:55] let's go back to um
[55:58] where we were they were
[56:01] he says
[56:02] but with one and then the ninth verse he
[56:04] says they're drunk
[56:06] but not with wine they stagger but not
[56:09] with strong drinks
[56:11] amen for the lord has poured out upon
[56:13] them the spirit of a deep sleep and has
[56:16] what
[56:18] close their eyes their prophets and your
[56:22] work
[56:23] and your seals has what
[56:25] has it covered
[56:28] god is covered and that's what happens
[56:31] we see the church world amen
[56:34] as a as a whole amen
[56:37] and i said you know what we trying to
[56:38] get
[56:40] bigger churches more members
[56:43] amen
[56:44] bigger buildings
[56:47] we're trying to get this and that and
[56:49] that's the lord just what is man caught
[56:51] up in
[56:53] is they concerned about the soul of
[56:54] people or how much they can do
[56:56] and look good amen
[56:58] and sometimes people are building
[57:00] hospitals they're building soup kitchens
[57:02] they're building this and that and they
[57:05] just you know it's more of an economic
[57:08] well what about the soul of man
[57:10] the bible says seek you first the
[57:11] kingdom of god and his righteousness and
[57:13] all other things will i what
[57:16] i'm i'm saying god is going to take care
[57:18] of all those other things if you seek
[57:21] god first
[57:22] amen i never seen the righteous forsaken
[57:25] us what
[57:27] but look look what man is i mean they'll
[57:29] achieve and accomplish amen the church
[57:32] would be rich increasing goods that i
[57:34] have needed nothing we see people are
[57:37] just expanding they're working hard man
[57:39] they just going wow
[57:41] amen and and then churches are growing
[57:44] like what multitudes they even turn them
[57:46] into a nightclub
[57:49] you go in they got the lights going and
[57:52] somebody said he even got the smoke
[57:53] going in the church
[57:55] amen and the people the young people are
[57:57] really getting in there and dancing
[57:59] they're getting in the groove at church
[58:02] and
[58:03] it's strange that people don't know no
[58:05] battle
[58:06] because why god said i'll pour out upon
[58:09] them the spirit of a deep sleep
[58:12] the people are sleep and they're drunk
[58:15] but not with wine
[58:17] are you with me
[58:19] so what what is happening

[58:24] upon our lives because people are drunk
[58:27] but not with the mind
[58:30] go ahead caleb
[58:35] the tempers
[58:37] for the lord hath poured out upon you
[58:39] the spirit of a deep sleep and hath
[58:42] closed your eyes the prophets in your
[58:44] root in your rulers the seer hath he
[58:47] covered
[58:48] and the vision of all is become unto you
[58:51] as the words of a book that is sealed
[58:54] as a book that is sealed
[58:57] i'm going to tell you something
[58:58] sometimes folk can sit in the church
[59:01] and
[59:02] the word come as a book that's sealed
[59:05] sometimes people are sat right here in
[59:08] the midst of the church
[59:10] and the word
[59:12] it's like a book that's been sealed
[59:15] why but go ahead
[59:18] which men deliver to one that is learned
[59:21] saying
[59:22] read this i pray thee and he said i
[59:25] cannot for it is sealed and and i'm
[59:28] going to tell you something
[59:31] when it's sealed
[59:32] you can't read something that's sealed
[59:35] somebody you got to open up that letter
[59:37] or whatever
[59:38] if you want to read it because it's
[59:40] sealed
[59:41] and the bible has been a sealed book
[59:44] are you with me
[59:46] but at the end the seal book is supposed
[59:48] to be an open book
[59:51] amen
[59:53] go ahead
[59:56] the book is delivered to him that is not
[59:58] learned saying read this i pray thee and
[1:00:01] he says i am not learned
[1:00:04] therefore the lord said for as much as
[1:00:06] those people draw near me for with their
[1:00:09] mouth
[1:00:10] look look
[1:00:13] isn't that the same thing happening
[1:00:14] today the people draw near me with their
[1:00:18] mouths
[1:00:19] and what and with their lips do honor me
[1:00:22] you see them
[1:00:23] and you can't holly go in the stone they
[1:00:25] say god bless you god bless you and you
[1:00:27] can see those same people before you
[1:00:29] know it they're cursing somebody out
[1:00:34] and they're saying god bless you that's
[1:00:36] good you know
[1:00:38] but their hearts are far from me
[1:00:40] their lives i mean they it's just a a
[1:00:43] saying that they say
[1:00:46] it's just something you can't convince
[1:00:48] folks now that you know you need to be
[1:00:51] saved because they they think that i can
[1:00:53] be saved and cursed and raise sand and
[1:00:56] live any kind of way and still save from
[1:00:58] what
[1:01:02] our folks are saved from what what are
[1:01:04] they saved from
[1:01:07] i mean the preachers
[1:01:09] the preachers and the prophets they got
[1:01:11] the people so blind to the people of
[1:01:14] thinking that they're going to heaven
[1:01:16] and and all of this just you know
[1:01:18] they're just thinking everything's going
[1:01:20] to be all right
[1:01:24] okay
[1:01:26] go ahead caleb but have to remove their
[1:01:28] heart far from me
[1:01:30] you see what i'm saying
[1:01:32] they removed their hearts far from me
[1:01:34] israel was in bad shape and i'm saying
[1:01:36] the church is in bad shape today
[1:01:38] they removed their hearts far from me
[1:01:42] you know
[1:01:44] god is saying to where's your heart is
[1:01:47] your heart in it
[1:01:49] do you really love
[1:01:50] god do you really care about your soul
[1:01:54] are you really concerned about your soul
[1:01:58] go ahead
[1:02:00] and their fear toward me is taught by
[1:02:02] the precept of men
[1:02:05] you know it's taught by the precepts of
[1:02:07] men go ahead therefore behold i will
[1:02:10] proceed to do a marvelous work among
[1:02:12] these people even a marvelous work in
[1:02:15] the wonder for the wisdom of their wise
[1:02:17] men shall perish and the understanding
[1:02:20] of their prudent men shall be hid
[1:02:22] woe unto them that seek deep to hide
[1:02:24] their counsel from the lord see
[1:02:27] you can't hide your sins and your
[1:02:29] counsel from the lord you can't hide
[1:02:32] from the lord don't try to don't don't

[1:02:37] the dark and they say who seeth us and
[1:02:40] who knoweth us

[1:02:44] down

[1:09:20] with jesus
[1:09:22] nobody can save you but jesus
[1:09:24] nobody redeems you but jesus
[1:09:29] are you with me
[1:09:31] so he took the book and he opened amen
[1:09:34] he positionally placed
[1:09:36] the season and the time the hour that
[1:09:39] they were living in
[1:09:41] amen and
[1:09:42] until that time they met everybody just
[1:09:45] didn't know
[1:09:47] where they were
[1:09:49] but when jesus took the book and he
[1:09:51] opened the book of the old testament
[1:09:54] amen that was sealed amen up and they
[1:09:57] were ignorant to the fact amen of those
[1:10:00] things that were written in the book but
[1:10:02] isaac had false said who has believed
[1:10:05] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:10:08] lord revealed
[1:10:10] for he should grow up as a tender plant
[1:10:12] and as a root out of dry ground
[1:10:15] are you with me
[1:10:16] god was coming to fulfill what isaiah 53
[1:10:20] said about him but they were blind to
[1:10:24] that amen
[1:10:26] they were drunk and they were filled
[1:10:28] with wine he meant of their pharisees
[1:10:31] religion and of their sadducee religion
[1:10:34] they were so
[1:10:37] denominational-minded they met and they
[1:10:39] were so blind in their religion
[1:10:42] in their religion and in their theology
[1:10:45] that they were so drunk in that and they
[1:10:48] were so overwhelmed and amen sometimes
[1:10:51] the church can blind you
[1:10:53] amen praise god and when god is moving
[1:10:56] outside of the church because they don't
[1:10:59] want jesus in the church
[1:11:02] they amen they want to do their own
[1:11:04] thing they're more interested in uh the
[1:11:07] building that their they got amen but
[1:11:10] even jesus disciples said
[1:11:12] lord it took 46 years to build this
[1:11:15] temple he said destroy this temple in
[1:11:17] three days i'll raise it up again i'm
[1:11:20] trying to get you on the spiritual
[1:11:21] revelation the temple that i'm
[1:11:23] interested in it's not this 46 year old

[1:11:30] interested in solomon temple because the
[1:11:33] greater than solomon is here i want you
[1:11:35] to know that your body is the temple of
[1:11:38] the holy ghost i want to dwell in you i
[1:11:42] want to make you my house and my house

[1:11:53] are you up man
[1:11:55] god is taking us places i'm talking
[1:11:57] about when he opened the book there's
[1:11:59] something about god opening the book
[1:12:02] there's something like god open in your
[1:12:04] eyes it's something about god revealing
[1:12:06] the book

[1:12:49] back luke he found the place where it
[1:12:52] was written
[1:12:53] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:12:55] because he anointed me to preach
[1:12:58] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:13:01] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:13:03] deliverance to the captives and
[1:13:05] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:13:07] at liberty them that are bruised
[1:13:10] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:13:12] lord now you if you notice in isaiah it
[1:13:15] said here at the separate year of the
[1:13:17] lord if you put your hand on isaiah 6
[1:13:20] 61 hold that there
[1:13:23] and go to isaiah 61
[1:13:25] and see
[1:13:26] how he broke the scripture in half
[1:13:29] are you with me and the prophet of god
[1:13:33] talked about
[1:13:34] this day this scripture is fulfilling
[1:13:36] your ears amen

[1:13:40] and go to isaiah 61.
[1:13:42] and i want you to
[1:13:44] read the second verse
[1:13:46] he said
[1:13:47] go go read the first verse
[1:13:49] the spirit of the lord is is upon me
[1:13:52] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:13:54] preach good tidings unto the meek
[1:13:57] he has sent me to bond up to
[1:13:59] broken-hearted to proclaim liberty to
[1:14:01] the captives
[1:14:02] in the opening of the prison to them
[1:14:04] that are bound
[1:14:06] to proclaim this acceptable year
[1:14:08] of the lord okay they accept the year of
[1:14:11] the lord and then he says what in the
[1:14:13] day of vengeance of our god see he broke
[1:14:16] the scripture in half because he wasn't
[1:14:17] fulfilling the last part that's our day
[1:14:21] the day of vengeance of our god
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] that's when the judgment hits
[1:14:27] but he he was doing the acceptable year
[1:14:29] of the lord
[1:14:30] and you see what i'm saying see the
[1:14:32] opening of the book the opening of the
[1:14:34] seals revealed to us what's going on it
[1:14:37] meant because it is
[1:14:39] is god that technical yes he's technical
[1:14:42] amen because this is god that's moving
[1:14:45] amen and if you look at the book you
[1:14:48] think amen uh that
[1:14:50] he talked about the whole thing but no
[1:14:52] he says an acceptable year of the lord
[1:14:55] this is amen when he comes to die not
[1:14:58] when he comes to judge
[1:15:00] are you with me
[1:15:01] but it's going to be a time when it's
[1:15:03] going to be the day of vengeance
[1:15:04] judgment is going to strike
[1:15:07] and the day of vengeance of our god our
[1:15:09] lord is coming back even him that pierce
[1:15:11] him don't see him every eye gonna sin
[1:15:13] but when he comes back for the rapture
[1:15:15] ever i don't see him
[1:15:17] amen praise god him that pierced him
[1:15:20] won't see him but he comes at the thief
[1:15:22] in the night and he comes to take his
[1:15:24] bride out of here isn't that right in
[1:15:26] the rapture amen praise god
[1:15:29] are y'all with me
[1:15:31] amen so uh when they said evie i don't
[1:15:34] see him amen

[1:15:39] amen that's the day of vengeance amen
[1:15:42] god's going to come back and it's going
[1:15:43] to be the last battle the final battle
[1:15:45] but i want you to be ready to get out of
[1:15:47] here because i want you to understand if
[1:15:50] the book had not been opened we wouldn't
[1:15:52] have understood what was going on right
[1:15:54] here
[1:15:55] amen the jews even though he read the
[1:15:58] acceptable year they still didn't
[1:16:00] understand even his disciples didn't
[1:16:01] fully understand that he was talking
[1:16:03] about the acceptable yield they still
[1:16:05] thought he'd come to restore the kingdom
[1:16:07] to israel they still thought he was they
[1:16:10] met the king and come to set on the
[1:16:12] throne of david they still was uh amen
[1:16:15] but god amen knowing amen that he he
[1:16:20] identified himself in scripture and what
[1:16:23] he was doing amen
[1:16:25] but they still missed it
[1:16:27] amen god can identify i'm talking about

[1:16:40] visitation don't miss your hour with the
[1:16:43] time that you're living in because it's
[1:16:45] a glorious time if you can only see it
[1:16:50] it don't mean nothing to the unbeliever
[1:16:52] the churchgoer the religious person the
[1:16:55] why don't mean a thing to them
[1:16:58] but to you and i it's a glorious season

[1:18:04] and know how you're living and know what
[1:18:06] god is requiring in your day
