[33:00] let us just bow our
[33:02] heads father we thank you again for an
[33:05] opportunity to come into your house as
[33:08] David said I was happy I was glad when
[33:10] they said it let us go into the house of
[33:13] the Lord father I just pray that the
[33:15] Holy Spirit would come speak to us Lord
[33:19] for for certainly their needs Lord and
[33:22] you said but my God shall supply all of
[33:26] your needs according to his riches and
[33:27] Glory
[33:28] so father we have needs tonight and Lord
[33:32] God you can touch heal and deliver you
[33:34] can save and set free whatever the needs
[33:38] are God may you meet every need in Jesus
[33:41] name bless your word
[33:43] amen Amos 3 and 7 uh 3 and
[33:48] 6 Amos 3 and
[33:51] 6 it says shall a trumpet be blown in
[33:55] the city and the people be not afraid
[33:57] afraid shall there be evil in this city
[34:01] and the Lord has not done it surely the
[34:05] Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals
[34:09] His Secrets unto his servants the
[34:12] prophets God bless you the read you may
[34:15] be
[34:16] seated we were talking on last night
[34:18] surely the Lord God would do
[34:20] nothing but he Reveals His secrets to
[34:23] his servant the prophet so surely the
[34:26] Lord God will do nothing
[34:30] and the top is surely the Lord God would
[34:33] do
[34:33] nothing it's a
[34:36] conjunction he said
[34:38] but he Reveals His secrets to servants
[34:41] and
[34:42] Prophet now if we turn to
[34:44] Luke
[34:46] 17 Luke
[34:51] 17 our expectation you know we might
[34:54] want to
[34:56] imagine um
[34:58] how it was in the Bible days well we
[35:01] never got out of the Bible days we're in
[35:03] the Bible days though the Bible was
[35:06] written you know some what the final W
[35:10] in was about over 2,000 years ago
[35:14] yet the
[35:16] Bible what was
[35:19] written was
[35:21] foretelling
[35:23] things so there was a a writing of the
[35:26] word and there's a fulfillment of the
[35:28] word so what was
[35:32] written had
[35:34] time for it to be
[35:36] fulfilled so by the grace of
[35:39] God let us look at how the Bible days
[35:43] was back
[35:44] then and notice and uh Luke
[35:48] 17:26 Luke
[35:53] 17:26 he
[35:56] says and it it was in the days of
[36:00] noi so shall it be also in the days of
[36:04] the son of
[36:05] man so like it was
[36:09] then so it would be in the days of the
[36:11] son of
[36:13] man they did eat they drank they married
[36:18] wives they were given in marriage until
[36:22] the day that Noah entered into the AR
[36:25] and the flood came and destroyed them
[36:30] all it says likewise also as it was in
[36:35] the days of
[36:36] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[36:41] they sold and they planted and they
[36:43] build but the same day the lot went out
[36:47] of
[36:48] Sodom one day God's going to take his
[36:51] bride
[36:54] away now we know Abraham was the type of
[36:57] the bride
[37:00] and and not lot are you with
[37:03] me remember two angels went down to
[37:06] Sodom
[37:07] right the prophet of gin is the type of
[37:10] or Roberts Billy Graham the Pentecost is
[37:13] and the fundamentals are you with
[37:16] me so we we we're seeing things happen
[37:19] that they
[37:21] would right they will lead the the arm
[37:25] of the world
[37:28] you know the Angels had to Smite
[37:31] blind the people in Sodom and
[37:34] gamorra because there was so much the
[37:37] men wanted to go with the
[37:39] angels and lot said I got some daughters
[37:42] here virgin daughters want you have them
[37:45] and they said no we want them
[37:48] men as it was back then so it is
[37:54] today likewise as it was in the days of
[37:57] lot and as it was in the days of Noah so
[38:01] shall it be here
[38:04] now okay he
[38:10] says the same
[38:12] day the lot went out of Sodom it rained
[38:16] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[38:19] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[38:22] in the day when the son of man is
[38:24] revealed you wonder why things are
[38:27] happening like it happens before
[38:30] judgment can strike it has to be the
[38:33] world has to get in a condition that
[38:36] warrant
[38:39] judgment before God will punish there
[38:42] must be condition met for
[38:47] punishment so judgment is going to
[38:49] strike you know you don't take your
[38:53] children and you want to punish them for
[38:56] they when they hadn't done nothing
[38:58] but when they've done something that's
[38:59] really bad then you need to correct them
[39:03] amen I think the world is in bad
[39:06] shap but the Bible says surely the Lord
[39:08] God will do
[39:10] nothing
[39:12] but let see we have to take the
[39:15] example that God what God did back
[39:18] then the Bible says Jesus Christ is same
[39:23] yesterday today
[39:25] and so I'm God and I change I don't
[39:30] change God don't
[39:32] change he don't change what God did
[39:38] then God weighs a
[39:41] perfect you can't better
[39:44] God if he did it this way then he'll
[39:47] keep on doing it the same
[39:48] way how come people expecting God to do
[39:51] something different from the way he's
[39:54] already done it always done so
[39:57] the way God warned people if God going
[40:01] to destroy the Earth with fire if the
[40:03] people say amen that the world is going
[40:06] to be destroyed This Time by fire not by
[40:08] water and God going to destroy the world
[40:11] God would always give man opportunity to
[40:16] repent a chance to
[40:18] repent but a man does not take the
[40:22] opportunity of repentance then judgment
[40:25] has the strike
[40:27] an individual in their life God will
[40:30] warn them and tell them warning after
[40:33] warning he speaks to them he speaks to
[40:36] him in the car wreck he speaks to him in
[40:39] the you know something you know a
[40:41] sickness at your body he speaks to you
[40:45] tell you amen you can go at any
[40:48] time he keeps Waring man he wants
[40:52] individuals he wants young people the
[40:55] young the elderly people he wants the
[40:57] middle age he wants it
[40:59] all and then sometimes he speaks and
[41:02] sometimes it's not with a voice it's it
[41:05] it's what a an happening something
[41:08] happens to try to get your attention
[41:10] amen God is talking to you but sometimes
[41:13] we
[41:14] said we go ahead on as though nothing
[41:18] happened nobody said anything but God
[41:20] says I'm talking to you amen that little
[41:23] small steel voice says I'm speaking to
[41:25] you if you don't get this try to correct
[41:28] it if you don't repent if you keep going
[41:30] in that way I have to bring
[41:32] judgment but sometimes man just as
[41:37] though they hear nothing they think they
[41:41] shake it off they just shake it off and
[41:45] God is wanting repent amen you
[41:48] know sometimes God says hey don't do
[41:53] that don't don't don't don't go and
[41:58] tax
[41:59] yourself don't go beyond your
[42:04] means and sometimes he said well I need
[42:08] I like that that that that new car I'mma
[42:11] get it I like that new house I'm GNA get
[42:14] it God said don't don't do
[42:18] that it's it's going to it's too
[42:21] expensive you're not going to be able to
[42:23] make
[42:23] it but what we do we override the voice
[42:27] of God so I'm saying like it is every
[42:31] day in our lives people
[42:33] override God's voice now God's voice he
[42:38] can speak with the art of a voice as the
[42:41] prophet say he can write with a finger
[42:43] he wrote the Ten Commandments he wrote
[42:45] on the wall meaning
[42:48] meaning God can talk he talked to Moses
[42:52] he talk you know Jesus on when he's on
[42:56] the mountain of the
[42:58] configuration he said this is my beloved
[43:00] Son John the Baptist he said you know he
[43:04] spoke whom I pleased to dwell God can
[43:07] talk God can write amen amen but he uses
[43:10] what he uses
[43:13] prophets he could write the word but he
[43:15] let let Moses Moses
[43:18] was way back Moses wasn't there in
[43:22] Genesis was he how can he write about
[43:25] Adam and Eve in the garden and all of
[43:26] that amen was he
[43:29] there you think God let him go back
[43:32] there and let him write about where the
[43:35] took place a prophet being a seal can
[43:37] look back and can look forward amen are
[43:41] you with me amen and then he can start
[43:43] writing and God can start speaking to
[43:46] him Moses this is what happened he could
[43:49] see it and write it the same time cuz he
[43:52] was a
[43:54] seal surely the Lord God could do
[43:56] nothing
[43:57] so here he is writing the five books of
[43:59] the Bible how you know whether or not is
[44:03] right we understand that all scriptures
[44:06] are given by inspiration of
[44:08] God Amen God
[44:12] inspired amen and no Prophecy of the
[44:15] scriptures of any private interpretation
[44:17] amen God himself was writing but he was
[44:20] using the
[44:21] prophet he was using Moses he was using
[44:25] Isaiah amen if God can do that that's
[44:28] the way he works amen he used Prophets
[44:31] The Bible this is this is gone in letter
[44:34] form amen but it's
[44:37] gone are you with me amen so what
[44:40] happens amen surely the Lord God would
[44:43] do
[44:44] nothing amen we look at God and we
[44:46] understand do we understand how God's
[44:49] work you know sometimes we just think
[44:52] it's just a church we come to church and
[44:54] we go in and out the Bible it's just a
[44:56] book it's not a book it's the word of
[44:58] God it's
[45:00] God
[45:02] Amen it tells you what's going to happen
[45:05] amen and how it's going to happen amen
[45:08] but sometimes we it it's sealed from us
[45:12] to the angel had to come down and tell
[45:14] Mary Mary you highly
[45:16] favored Mary you are the word that's
[45:20] going to be manifested for this hour

[45:33] know what scriptures amen your faith can
[45:38] anoint amen your faith can believe and
[45:41] expect it to happen for this particular
[45:43] season amen amen because you are you at
[45:47] the place where God comes down reveals
[45:50] himself to you amen amen God sends a
[45:54] prophet to wake you up to the age or the
[45:57] period of time that you're living in and
[46:00] in the expectation what God is expecting
[46:02] of you amen are you with me so God tells

[46:29] laid amen and you know we built upon the
[46:33] foundation of the Apostles and the
[46:35] prophets Jesus Christ himself being what
[46:37] the Chief
[46:38] Cornerstone I said surely the Lord God
[46:41] will do nothing but he Reveals His
[46:44] secrets to his servants the prophet amen
