[39:45] long Joshua 24 and we'll begin for the
[39:49] sake of time we can begin here at
[39:55] the
[39:57] let's begin at
[40:01] the at the 12th
[40:07] verse you got it sayen and it reads and
[40:11] when the children of Israel heard of it
[40:14] though wrong wrong scripture sorry about
[40:19] that let's start start at the what I say
[40:21] the 12th start at the 12th
[40:23] verse and I and I sent the horn before
[40:26] you which drave them out from before you
[40:30] even the two kings of the amorites but
[40:33] not with the sword nor with thy bow and
[40:35] I have given you a land for which you
[40:38] did not labor and cities which you built
[40:40] not and ye dwell in them of The
[40:43] Vineyards and Olive yards which which
[40:47] you planted not do you eat now therefore
[40:51] fear the lord and serve him in sincerity
[40:54] and in truth and put away the gods which
[40:57] your fathers served on the other side of
[41:00] the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the
[41:03] Lord and if it seem evil unto you to
[41:07] serve the Lord choose you this day whom
[41:10] you will serve whether the gods which
[41:13] your fathers served that were on the
[41:15] other side of the flood or the gods of
[41:17] the amorites in whom whose land ye dwell
[41:21] but as for me and my house we will serve
[41:24] the Lord and the people answered and
[41:26] said said God forbid that we should
[41:28] forsake the Lord to serve other gods for
[41:30] the Lord Our God he it is that brought
[41:34] us up and our fathers out of the land of
[41:36] Egypt from the house of bondage and
[41:39] which did those great things in our
[41:41] sight and preserved Us in all the way
[41:44] wherein we went and among all the people
[41:47] through whom we passed may God a bless
[41:50] the reading of his word you may be
[41:51] seated tonight just for a moment amen I
[41:55] want to I want to to speak to you just
[41:57] for a moment on choices
[41:59] Amen on choices you know just kind of
[42:03] lay a background here this is Joshua
[42:05] here you know speaking to the people and
[42:08] you know you can go home later I skipped
[42:11] over a lot of the salutation he was giv
[42:13] to people for the time sake but you know
[42:16] he was just they come to a place I guess
[42:19] and and and where you know God brought
[42:22] them out by Mighty Deliverance he did
[42:25] great things in their lives
[42:26] and they were going over he was going
[42:29] over some of the things and and the
[42:31] Deliverance that God had brought uh in
[42:34] their lives so and they could
[42:36] acknowledge that yes God has been good
[42:39] to us but even in all of what God had
[42:43] done for him God still wasn't going to
[42:45] force uh them to choose to to to love
[42:48] him or to choose him he still was going
[42:50] to give him a choice and all that God
[42:53] and all the good goodness and the things
[42:55] that God did he still was going to give
[42:57] them a choice to whether they want to
[42:59] serve him or not but before the choice
[43:02] was given out to them the the the
[43:05] Proclamation was given to them he just
[43:07] reminded them like we said of all the
[43:09] goodness that he's done and he says now
[43:13] if you still want to go after those
[43:14] other gods go ahead after them but it
[43:17] was Joshua you know giving out a
[43:19] salutation but one of the things he says
[43:22] you know in the short term saying it
[43:25] that you know y'all can do whatever
[43:27] y'all want to do but as for me and my
[43:29] house we going to serve the Lord because
[43:33] you know it it's it's more than just his
[43:36] goodness that we look at sometimes you
[43:38] know sometimes we we serve God only like
[43:41] they say in the good times but I I've
[43:43] been looking it's more than just God's
[43:45] goodness but you know we know that by
[43:48] love and kindness he's draw he's draws
[43:50] us but to me it's more it's I I thank
[43:54] him for the goodness but it's it's more
[43:56] to some some what about the grace of God
[44:00] I always have that little saying that if
[44:01] God don't do nothing else he already did
[44:04] enough and that's and that's true
[44:06] because just Just For What where he's
[44:09] brought us from just for saving our
[44:11] souls and filling us with the precious
[44:13] Holy Ghost for him doing those things
[44:15] that's already enough to carry us out
[44:17] throughout eternity so in this life when
[44:20] you when you sold when you come you find
[44:23] yourself sold out to God then it's
[44:26] nothing else that the devil no trial no
[44:28] test no none of those things will be
[44:30] able to shake you away from the
[44:32] Salvation your salvation you know I was
[44:35] ministering last week on on patience by
[44:38] trials because the Bible says that
[44:40] tribulation work is patience patient
[44:42] experience experience hope hope make it
[44:44] not as shame right and those things it
[44:46] says that there there's no uh temptation
[44:49] all those things that that's come under
[44:50] you that you know the Saints of old
[44:52] ain't already been tried tried by but
[44:55] these things things are coming to try
[44:57] you that that uh uh you might gain
[45:00] patience out of it because patience is
[45:02] going to perfect you but we talking
[45:05] about the choices I'm talking about
[45:06] choices tonight you know I said every
[45:09] man's got a
[45:10] choice you got a choice you got a choice
[45:13] here tonight amen a choice of what you
[45:16] want to do with yourself let's say it
[45:18] like that choice what you want to do
[45:20] with your life you know where you find
[45:24] yourself th that's
[45:26] been living a little while where you
[45:29] find yourself at today are results of a
[45:32] choice that you made earlier in life
[45:36] come on I always tell people 10 years
[45:39] now where you'll be 10 years now is
[45:41] going to be the results of a decision
[45:43] that you made or choices that you made a
[45:46] lot of times we want to blame God
[45:49] sometimes for our life being in chaos or
[45:54] our life being in shipwreck or our life
[45:56] being in uh uh bad places we were saying
[46:00] the other night you know some people
[46:03] were saying that one time but I says you
[46:05] know you can't put that on
[46:07] God because where you find yourself
[46:10] where you found yourself was a choice
[46:11] that you made God was merciful that you
[46:14] still have breath you still have life
[46:17] you still got chance to you know make it
[46:19] right and to serve him but don't blame I
[46:23] said don't blame God for being where you
[46:25] are because of a choice that you made
[46:27] because God put freely before every man
[46:30] life and death and that's what it was
[46:32] you know and uh even though God created
[46:35] us and somebody some people say you know
[46:37] you know as the Bible talks about
[46:39] predestination and all those things God
[46:41] can't predestinate you he could write
[46:43] your name there because he already know
[46:46] he still gave you the ability to choose
[46:49] but he already know what choice you
[46:50] would make he already know what decision
[46:53] you make so before the foundation of the
[46:56] world he could write your name there it
[46:58] wouldn't be by coincidence that you and
[47:01] I would be here tonight and and have it
[47:04] in our hearts to serve the Lord or just
[47:07] come together from different walks of
[47:09] life different areas but have one in the
[47:11] same desire that no matter what hole I
[47:15] came out of or no matter what uh uh
[47:17] family or or Trend that I came out of
[47:20] our desires is all the same because God
[47:22] put it there and that is to do what to
[47:24] serve God I don't know about you but you
[47:27] know we have a lot of goals and
[47:30] Ambitions in life a lot of things that
[47:32] we want to do and Achieve but it's one
[47:35] thing that that could never uh uh I
[47:37] could never get away from since the Lord
[47:40] come into your life is that that the
[47:42] main goal is to make
[47:44] Heaven the main goal out of all the
[47:47] things that I'm trying to do and achieve
[47:49] my main goal is to do whatever the will
[47:51] of God
[47:53] is and sometimes the the will of God
[47:57] ain't ain't ain't necessarily what's
[47:58] going to be good and what we feel or
[48:00] what we want you know even Jesus when he
[48:04] was in yesin he was crying out he said
[48:07] Lord if it be possible let this cup pass
[48:10] but not that my will but let thy will be
[48:13] done come on because he knew what what
[48:17] what his destination was he knew what
[48:19] the road was before him right and even
[48:22] though he might have within himself know
[48:25] it was a hard rooll and and and and
[48:27] wanted to cut to pass but nevertheless
[48:29] he
[48:30] knew that that it meant more to to be in
[48:33] what to do whatever the will of God was
[48:35] more than what he desired and I feel
[48:38] that way tonight I hope you feel that
[48:39] way tonight God you know I said I asked
[48:43] a question do you want what God's will
[48:45] is for your life come
[48:48] on I want what God's will is for my life
[48:51] but in all us like we says what God does
[48:54] he uh he he gives us uh uh choices right
[48:58] he gives you the the ability to
[49:01] choose he's not God is one thing about
[49:04] God the devil might try to force you to
[49:06] do things but God Don't Force you he's
[49:09] not brute like that God is he makes you
[49:12] a free moral agian right people come to
[49:15] God and that's why you know when when
[49:17] when Jesus came the Bible says there was
[49:19] no beauty that we should desire him
[49:22] right you you came to God people didn't
[49:25] come to God because of his Beauty they
[49:28] didn't come to Jesus because of of who
[49:30] he was how much money he had and all
[49:32] those things but he made it the way that
[49:34] the only people that would come to him
[49:36] is the people that wanted to come to him
[49:38] or the people that were in such a need
[49:41] that against all of what the standard
[49:44] standards was of what they thought God
[49:47] was supposed to look like or was
[49:49] supposed to be they had to Lo lose all
[49:51] of that because they were in a need
[49:54] Hallelujah and I don't know sometimes
[49:57] that's why God you know God we look at
[50:00] situations on our lives but God gets us
[50:02] to that place to where we can see how
[50:05] much we need him come on and even in
[50:07] those low times don't you know sometimes
[50:10] people still don't know how much they
[50:11] need him am you know I was I share I
[50:15] share with one of my brothers all the
[50:17] time maybe listening in theight but I
[50:20] share with him I says everybody Rock
[50:22] Bottom ain't the
[50:24] same but you know it when you get there
[50:27] come on everybody's on ain't the
[50:30] same sometime God got to take people
[50:34] through all this and all that sometime
[50:36] God just got to take people through a
[50:38] little right but nevertheless the goal
[50:40] is the same God loves you tonight how
[50:43] much do God got what does God got to do
[50:45] to show you how much he love
[50:48] you I asked that question what does how
[50:51] much does God got to do to show us that
[50:53] he cares about us what what else does he
[50:56] have to do come on hasn't he gone
[50:59] through enough hasn't he done enough
[51:01] that we can say Lord I thank you God you
[51:04] don't got to you don't got I ain't going
[51:05] to take God through nothing else I'm
[51:06] going to lift him up because I know he
[51:09] already been through enough come on you
[51:13] know
[51:14] sometimes a as a as a as a children we
[51:18] was saying that sometimes a parent can
[51:20] do all that they that they uh can
[51:24] possibly do for a child right sometime
[51:27] the child don't see the parent working
[51:29] going in the work sick going in the work
[51:32] in pain going through the Mind child
[51:34] can't see what the parent doing just so
[51:36] they can have clothes on their back just
[51:39] so they can have lights and water food
[51:41] they only see the the parents sometime
[51:43] and up but they don't see those midnight
[51:45] hours they don't see the The Taking of
[51:48] sometimes what they got to put up with
[51:50] on the job do they but they might get to
[51:54] a place in their life and say Mom and
[51:56] Daddy ain't never did nothing for me
[51:59] right but if they can only see the the
[52:03] the agony the pain the the things that
[52:05] that parent had to go through come on
[52:07] but that's how we treat God sometime
[52:09] ain't it come on it ain't that we might
[52:12] say that but our attitude towards him if
[52:15] we only knew what God the the the depths
[52:19] that he went through come on we give him
[52:23] praise like we didn't have our right
[52:25] mind we'd come in the house of God if we
[52:28] only knew the depths of what it cost for
[52:31] you to be here tonight come on we don't
[52:34] understand the depths we don't
[52:36] understand how he was sitting on the
[52:39] throne worshiped of angels come on
[52:42] streets of gold pearls and all those
[52:44] things the Angels crying out holy we
[52:46] don't understand the depths of all that
[52:49] he gave up Hallelujah to come to a
[52:53] people that reject him
[52:55] to come save a people that's ashamed of
[52:58] him a people a world that don't want him
[53:02] we don't understand the depth sometimes
[53:04] but when we think about it we learn to
[53:07] praise God right then when we think
[53:10] about it we learn to say Lord thank
[53:12] you thank you for what you done for me I
[53:16] ain't worried about what I got right now
[53:18] thank you for what you did thank you for
[53:20] life health and strength strength if you
[53:24] didn't take those weapons we wouldn't
[53:26] have healing tonight you know he hadn't
[53:29] to take that all that suffering was for
[53:32] our healing you know
[53:34] that all that Whip and the beats and the
[53:37] and all that Agony was for our healing
[53:40] come on all that Dragon AC cross going
[53:43] up galath was because he desired for you
[53:45] and I to be saved he knew that we and
[53:49] ourselves were rotten wretched come on
[53:52] undone don't think about how good you
[53:54] are what you didn't do you will come
[53:57] into the world speaking lies ready to be
[54:00] condemned from the womb that's how we
[54:02] came in the world but Jesus came one day
[54:07] Hallelujah the lamb was slain before the
[54:10] foundation of the world that we don't
[54:12] have to cover for our own sins but the
[54:15] blood hallelujah oh Jesus the blood of
[54:19] speak for us I'm so glad I couldn't
[54:22] speak for myself and I had to realize
[54:24] that one day but I needed that blood
[54:27] that without that shedding of blood
[54:29] Hallelujah but God came I'm so glad he
[54:31] came along one day aren't you glad
[54:33] tonight come on but still yet like we
[54:36] says what it is God gives you a choice
[54:39] don't he come on that's what Joshua is
[54:42] laying out before here it's many that
[54:44] made the wrong choice you know that many
[54:47] that made choices that they couldn't
[54:49] recover from but God God allow gives us
[54:54] the ability to choose come on that's
[54:57] what it is think about it every time you
[54:59] know you got choices to make you had
[55:01] choice to make whether you was going to
[55:02] come to church tonight right God didn't
[55:05] force you to come here you had a choice
[55:07] didn't you I'm glad you chose right God
[55:11] is glad you chose but what are you going
[55:12] to do when you get here hallelujah come
[55:15] on oh what time he going to go too long
[55:18] tonight no I'm glad God I'm glad to be
[55:20] in that number one more time come on I
[55:23] could have been dead laid up in the
[55:26] grave somewhere in the hospital come on
[55:28] somebody was telling me about a
[55:30] condition today I could have been in
[55:32] that condition come on not with life
[55:36] health and strength but God hallelujah
[55:38] who was rich in Mercy came by Hallelujah
[55:42] and he desired to smile on me I'm so
[55:45] glad that God Smiled On Me come on at an
[55:48] early age and even right now God is
[55:50] still smiling on you but yet like we say
[55:53] you have a choice God ain't going to
[55:55] force you right come on but you know
[55:57] many times though God gives us choices
[56:01] and though we know how good God Is Right
[56:04] a lot of times people still make the
[56:06] wrong
[56:07] choice why sometimes
[56:11] why sometimes you ask the question why
[56:14] come on we got so many examples
[56:17] sometimes of people that walk down
[56:19] certain roads and you know where that
[56:21] road end up at right it could be told
[56:26] the stories can be told over and over
[56:28] and over but yet people still make the
[56:31] choice to go down the wrong road don't
[56:34] they come on thinking that you might get
[56:37] different
[56:38] results Hallelujah but I know that there
[56:41] is a road called a straight and the
[56:43] narrow way and I know what the results
[56:45] of that road is It's A Hard Road yes it
[56:49] is because it's so narrow you got to
[56:51] walk down it by yourself it's so narrow
[56:54] you you can't even take your wife with
[56:56] you so narrow you can't take your friend
[56:59] with you so narrow you can't take Mom
[57:01] and Daddy with you you got to walk by
[57:04] yourself Hallelujah but at the end of
[57:07] that road is life Hallelujah you say you
[57:11] walking by yourself but God is there
[57:13] with you the whole time I like that
[57:15] little song they sang It's been a long
[57:18] long journey but Jesus been right here
[57:20] by my side the whole time come on but I
[57:23] said you got a choice come on and that's
[57:25] what uh uh laying out we can I has so
[57:27] many got so many examples we can use
[57:29] tonight throughout all the scriptures of
[57:31] choices come on you think about in the
[57:33] Garden of Eden Adam and Eve had a choice
[57:36] didn't they come on God put them there
[57:39] made the garden Beautiful Everything God
[57:41] made was good wasn't it and they had a
[57:44] choice he put before them life and death
[57:47] didn't he and you could choose what you
[57:50] want life or death come on somebody said
[57:53] I would have never chose death
[57:55] what made them choose death over life
[57:58] come on now we can go into the plan of
[58:01] God and all those things yes we can go
[58:03] in all that but in all in in the end of
[58:06] all of it they made a choice didn't they
[58:09] what made them choose death over
[58:12] life
[58:14] hallelujah what made them choose pain
[58:17] over
[58:19] Joy what made him choose Trouble Over
[58:22] peace what made him choose Hal
[58:24] Hallelujah you know the Bible says that
[58:27] when Eve saw the tree and she saw it was
[58:30] good for food come on her eyes deceived
[58:32] or didn't it come on that she was
[58:35] willing for what she saw what she heard
[58:38] or what the devil told her come on made
[58:41] it sound so good that it sound better
[58:44] than what God had
[58:46] Hallelujah sometimes it looks so
[58:49] appealing you you think about our young
[58:52] folks a lot of times the world look so
[58:55] appeasing so appealing look Smart in
[58:58] what God has for you but look at the
[59:01] end look down the road look at the end
[59:04] of the story come on
[59:07] Hallelujah God wants to give you life
[59:10] might seem like a bing Road might seem
[59:12] like a boring life but I tell you what
[59:14] God came in my life at an early age and
[59:16] I never regretted it hallelujah it's
[59:19] been joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[59:22] some of the pain I a have to go through
[59:24] Hallelujah why because God already he
[59:26] already he took me out of that
[59:28] Hallelujah and I'm glad he did I don't
[59:31] regret it not one day Hallelujah but you
[59:34] said why did they choose why would they
[59:36] choose uhh death you know she saw it she
[59:40] it was something that you know desires
[59:43] come on to make one
[59:45] wise Hallelujah but in all the end you
[59:49] know choosing
[59:51] death come on because the day they eat
[59:54] the day you eat of it the day you was
[59:56] going to die they died come on but I I
[1:00:00] begin to you know just meditate on it
[1:00:03] and every time pain struck Hallelujah
[1:00:07] that pain was a result of the choice
[1:00:10] that you she made
[1:00:12] right every time sickness came that was
[1:00:16] the result Hallelujah of the choice you
[1:00:19] made every time hard time the the the
[1:00:23] animals turn against you the ground turn
[1:00:25] against you sorrow sickness all that was
[1:00:28] a result of a of the choice Hallelujah
[1:00:31] that they made they gave up life gave up
[1:00:35] eternal life gave up all of that
[1:00:38] Hallelujah because of the choice they
[1:00:40] made right God in his solving Grace
[1:00:44] though had a way to get us back
[1:00:46] Hallelujah to get us back from the chaos
[1:00:49] to get us back but he says I ain't going
[1:00:51] to force you back make a choice
[1:00:54] Hallelujah
[1:00:55] I said what choice will you make tonight
[1:00:57] but the problem I say what it is you
[1:01:00] know all of that and we can go through
[1:01:01] all the scriptures throughout the
[1:01:03] scriptures but I say all of these things
[1:01:07] was was the results and the choice they
[1:01:09] made they just chose to disobey
[1:01:11] God come on the choice was to disobey
[1:01:15] him I said what what it is we find that
[1:01:19] we we make choices in
[1:01:22] life but we don't want to deal with the
[1:01:25] after
[1:01:26] effects of the choices that we
[1:01:29] made it's hard to deal with the after
[1:01:33] effects of your choice come on right now
[1:01:36] it might seem pleasurous I'm going to
[1:01:38] deal with it I'm going to do it now
[1:01:39] because it's pleasur I'll deal with it
[1:01:41] later but when the later comes it's hard
[1:01:43] to deal with it hard to deal with the
[1:01:46] choices that we made come on so many I
[1:01:51] got tell you a couple testimonies but
[1:01:54] but friends that made choices that took
[1:01:57] away their life took away took away all
[1:02:00] things from them because of choice I
[1:02:03] deal with it I know the consequence but
[1:02:05] you didn't know how severe the
[1:02:06] consequences was going to be you didn't
[1:02:09] know how severe it was going to be of

[1:06:43] nervous in your spirit cuz you can't
[1:06:45] never be too
[1:06:46] overconfident come on you get a little
[1:06:49] nervous in your spirit Lord I said God
[1:06:51] but I know one thing you never lost one
[1:06:55] I said you didn't bring me this far to
[1:06:57] lose me that same fire that was lit
[1:07:00] that's been over 20 years ago now I said
[1:07:03] God I still it's still burning that
[1:07:06] desire that was met that was made that
[1:07:08] that came I still have that same desire
[1:07:11] and that is to be pleasing in your sight
[1:07:13] come on and I won't let nothing change
[1:07:15] that how many feel that way tonight come
[1:07:18] on but you got choices to make make the
[1:07:20] right choice the Young Rich ruler he had
[1:07:22] a choice didn't he but he didn't make
[1:07:24] the right choice Moses had a choice
[1:07:27] didn't he but he made the right choice
[1:07:29] so many out of the scriptures when it
[1:07:31] was laid before him they had a choice to
[1:07:33] make God ain't forc no not one person he
[1:07:36] won't Force you but he he he says
[1:07:38] whosoever will let him come you know I
[1:07:41] was meditating the other day on on that
[1:07:43] I said that he ain't willing that any
[1:07:45] should
[1:07:46] perish not you know God somebody say God
[1:07:49] he want them no he's not willing that
[1:07:51] any should perish but that all should
[1:07:55] come to what repentance and that's hard
[1:07:58] for
[1:07:59] us yes yes he said he set before us life
[1:08:03] and death you
[1:08:05] choose amen yet he says no
[1:08:08] man can
[1:08:10] come to Jesus except the father
[1:08:15] drawing so by the grace of God I thank
[1:08:18] God that the the choice that we made we
[1:08:20] had an unction from the Holy One if was
[1:08:24] somebody amen nudging
[1:08:26] us helping us
[1:08:28] oh so it was that voice that
[1:08:32] it we heard God called
[1:08:36] us and then we made the right choice
[1:08:39] because we knew that it was God that was
[1:08:43] calling us
[1:08:44] amen and as you see God calling you
[1:08:47] brother and sister don't waste this
