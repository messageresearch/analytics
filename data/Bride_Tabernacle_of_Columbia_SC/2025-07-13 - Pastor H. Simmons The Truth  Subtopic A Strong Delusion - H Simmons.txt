Heal the bodies and save and deliver filled with your spirit, God. But we need you now. Have mercy on us. In Jesus Christ's wonderful name we pray. Amen. As we stand the book of St. John 18 and33. Praise God. This morning we were last week or so we were dealing with the truth. The truth. Amen. It says in 33, I'll read the first, you'll read the next, and we'll read the 38th verse together. Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, said unto him, "At thou the king of the Jews?" 34 &gt;&gt; Jesus answered him thyself or others of &gt;&gt; Palan answer am I a Jew thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done 36 &gt;&gt; Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world Then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now is my kingdom not from hence. &gt;&gt; Pilate therefore said unto him, thou king. Then Jesus answered, thou said that I am a king. To this end was I born. And for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. 38 together Pilate said unto him, what is truth? And when he said he went out to the Jews and said unto them, I find in him no fault at all. God bless you. Read this word. You may be seated. Thank God for and throughout America and the world may go because they believe that they are going for the truth. Many people are sincerely uh persuaded that what they believe is truth. &gt;&gt; So and then for because we come to church we take for granted that Christianity is the right way and not Buddha, not Hinduism, not Confucianism, not Muhammad of Muslims. We believe that we are coming to church because we're serving the true and living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Pilate asked the question because he would didn't identify himself as a Jew or as a as a believer. He says to uh your people, your your your high priest and all of them, they they they delivered you to us. What what what did you do? And Jesus question answered about my kingdom is not of this world. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know he he understood that he said are you a king? So uh often times people will question your relationship with God and who are you? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; What kind of church is this that you go to? What what do you believe? Mhm. &gt;&gt; And uh who do you think you are? Why go to the church you go to? &gt;&gt; Why believe like you believe? &gt;&gt; So here what he says, I came to bear witness of the truth. &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus. &gt;&gt; So Paul, the question was, what is truth? &gt;&gt; I was just talking last week down in Louisiana. What is truth? &gt;&gt; That's right. So um but this morning I I I said the truth for a subtopic a strong delusion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A strong delusion. Sometimes we are not hallucinating but because of certain uh religious ideology sometimes we are not in love with God like we should be because sometimes it's deception is in among us and we believe in a different persuasions Denomination got its own truth. &gt;&gt; The Baptist have their truth. The Methodists have their truth. &gt;&gt; Catholicism have their poke in their truth. &gt;&gt; Different apostolic PW has their truth. UPC has their truth. &gt;&gt; Bless. &gt;&gt; Church of God in Christ have its truth. Church of God has its truth. &gt;&gt; Church of Christ has its truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can go on and on. People are not going to church to hear something that's false, &gt;&gt; but they're going to church because they're persuaded that they're going to hear the truth. As I said, Paul said, "What is truth?" Since Jesus said he bear witness of the truth, what is it? Second Thessalonians the second chapter. I want to just talk about for a moment a strong delusion. Could we be in a delusion? A strong delusion? Are we really worshiping God? Not like the woman at the well. She went there to worship God because uh she said our fathers worship in this mountain. He said, "But the Jews said in Jerusalem, that's where we ought to worship." But he said, "Our father Jacob build this well." Sometimes you look at grandma, granddaddy or some family member that has started the church and started the religion and and she had a a reputable representative that the reason why she worshiped in that mountain. She had a godly man that had wrestled with her angel and name was changed from Jacob to Israel and he had power with the Lord. Sometime we can look back and we can see the foundation in which our uh uh religion our faith was based upon. And sometimes it was godly people that struggled and battled and believed God and trusted God. But that was then. But what's now? See Jesus said the hour cometh to the woman and now is that the true worshippers of God going to worship him not at Jerusalem and neither in this mountain but the true worship is going to worship him in spirit &gt;&gt; and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was bringing us to present tense truthmen. That was the truth that was God was revealing for the hour that he was in. &gt;&gt; For Jesus went into the temple and he took the book and he read the spirit of the Lord God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the gospel. He went on to talk about proclaim liberty to them that was bruised. Amen. And somebody said he come to lead captivity captive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that were bound, he was going to set them free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall what? Make you &gt;&gt; free." &gt;&gt; Make you free. So often times we struggle. We battle. We go to church and we take for granted that what we're hearing and what we're listening to because somebody read out the Bible. Somebody quoted scripture. Somebody Amen. spoke to our conscience and made us feel a little better. And we thought perhaps this is all I need. &gt;&gt; But I said truth is not limited to your church. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not limited to your denomination and to your ideology, your what you believe. The truth is not limited &gt;&gt; to what you think. &gt;&gt; Some people have bottled it up and think they got it. Fail to recognize the truth. Amen. It's continually being revealed &gt;&gt; to you as an individual. The Bible said the path of the just proverb says that the shining light was shining more and more to the perfect day. &gt;&gt; If I can get ahead of myself for a little while, Jesus said that I am the way. &gt;&gt; To answer the question, what is truth? She said, I am the way, &gt;&gt; the truth, and the what? &gt;&gt; Light. So if you think that your church or your preacher uh uh uh is the truth, then you certainly you would be wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You would think that some man or some preacher or some poke or uh some doctor of theology or uh some nomination of persuasion is truth then you would be certainly wrong. Amen. me think because I join the church and I'm a member of such and such that I have the truth so you might set safe and secure thinking that all is well and I don't have nothing to worry about because I've joined the church maybe I've been baptized uh maybe I maybe spoke in tongues maybe I shouted maybe I cried eyes for what is truth. &gt;&gt; Is it possible that I could be deceived? That I could be uh led astray? Could it be possible that what I'm believing now is past truth, past tense? And could I believe that what's going to happen in the future not recognizing what truth is today and what God is doing for us right now for he said he opened the book he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he's anointed me to preach the gospel this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears &gt;&gt; he was identifying his ministry and what he was doing &gt;&gt; and said this today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that we ought to be fired up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stirred up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On fire for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I would that you hot or cold, lukewarm. I'll spew you out my mouth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ought to be excited. &gt;&gt; Because of the truth, light has shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I got to go back here and try to catch everybody up because I've talked too long. It says, "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him." That's what we're gathered to him. &gt;&gt; That you be not what? Soon what? &gt;&gt; Shaken in mind. shaken in mind or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by what? &gt;&gt; Word. &gt;&gt; Word, nor by letter as from us, as that day of Christ is where? &gt;&gt; Now, that was 2,000 years ago. Could it be prophecy that that day now is at hand? &gt;&gt; Because he said that that day is at hand. Could God be speaking? Amen. When Isaiah wrote Isaiah uh 61, the spirit of the Lord God is upon me. Jesus picked it up and he read it in Luke and said in Luke, he said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me." &gt;&gt; Praise God. You must know if God has anointed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you recognize who you are. And are you the anointed word for the hour that we live in? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Are you the manifestation? Amen. What God is doing in this last day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is your life, Amen, reflecting the the light that God said he would shine in the evening time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And can you identify with that truth? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And can you Amen. stand as Jesus stood? said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, huh, you sound a little, you know, you you sound a little on yourself, isn't this is an individual journey. You must identify who you are." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life." He I am not not I was, not I shall be, but I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to know who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not just coming to church and going through motion. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And who's I am &gt;&gt; amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I can identify with the word that's promised for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you can be in a promised word, but is it promised for the day? Your promises that God promised you for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you identify God? You promised me, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; in this day, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That you would have a people on the scene, &gt;&gt; a church that would be not spot or wrinkle. Amen. A blemish or any such thing. Not just any kind of way we come to church, but a holy people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A people that don't mind praising God. &gt;&gt; To recognize that they are the lights that's going to shine in a dark world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know who I am. Oh God, &gt;&gt; something got to happen down deep in our soul. &gt;&gt; The quicken us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The quickening word for the hour that we live in. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe that the spirit of the Lord has uh hh anointed us to bring forth, Amen. the shining light for the hour that we live in. But if you don't know, then I said down there, uh, we don't light a candle and put it on the busher. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you are the lights of the world, it be a city that sets on a hill that cannot be hid. &gt;&gt; But when we take the light and put it under the bushel, amen, it ain't no good. &gt;&gt; God wants you on a candlestick. You need to be praising God because you are the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to let everybody know, amen, that Jesus Christ is alive and well. &gt;&gt; He lives within me. &gt;&gt; I love him and he &gt;&gt; loves me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't mind. I know what he's done for me. &gt;&gt; I know he died for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know he rose again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just 2,000 years ago, but he has risen in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he said, "You has he quickened who were dead and trespass in sin." &gt;&gt; Amen. You has he made alive when you were dead and trespass in your sin, now you're alive. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be alive. &gt;&gt; Praise God. In the third verse of 2 Thessalonians 2, he said, "Let no man what? &gt;&gt; Deceive you &gt;&gt; by any means." God have mercy. People just take it for granted that this deception is not working. He said, "The spirit speakest expressly that the latter days men should depart from the faith, giving heed to deducing spirits and doctrines of devils." &gt;&gt; Did the Bible say that? &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't let no man what?" &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible said, "A serpent begal Eve through his satility, so your mind should be corrupt from the simplicity that is in Christ." Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said, "Let your women keep silent in the church, for it's a shame for them to speak. If they can learn anything, let them ask their husband where." &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish they could ask your husband at home. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now," he said, "if Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived being in the transgression." Ain't that right? Uh it ain't this ain't the right day to say that. Isn't it right? It's Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; But we're talking about deception. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; We're talking about a strong delusion. How do people become delusional and go to church and they delusional? How did they get in that kind of condition? People almost believe that it's all right uh for homosexuality. It's all right to have a a church full of all kind of craziness going on and showing and performing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's have let's just have some praise dances and dance over here. Let's have this and let's have that. &gt;&gt; They coming to church and they entertaining folk instead of folks coming under conviction and said, "I need God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need deliverance. I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; We're interested in performing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means that that day shall not come. Talking about except there come a what? &gt;&gt; And that man of sin be revealed the son of predition. Ain't that right? Maybe it's the folk out of the USA who's who opposes and exalt himself above all that is called what? &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; all that is worship so that he as God what &gt;&gt; of God &gt;&gt; showing himself that he is &gt;&gt; God. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; People can you reckon people can sit in the temple of God and be worshiping the wrong one? worshiping the devil and don't know it &gt;&gt; cuz they will receive a strong delusion. &gt;&gt; Go to church and look. Oh, he said if it's possible he deceived what? &gt;&gt; Very elect. &gt;&gt; Very elect. The Bible said a and he talks about uh the beasts. And he said he deceiveth the whole what? &gt;&gt; All them whose names are not written in the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world. Ain't nobody going to deceive me. I know. No, no, no, no, no, no. He deceived the whole world. And if it was possible, he deceived even the very elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But for the elect's sake, he short the days. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't think, hey, nobody going to deceive me. Praise God. Oops. I know. I know. Read my Bible. I know God, man. Let's be humble. &gt;&gt; Say, God, show me the way. Yes. &gt;&gt; Lord, lead me. Guide me. &gt;&gt; For I need your your guidance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need your help. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I can't leave myself. I need you to lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk to me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I desire truth. The Bible says, David said, "I desire truth from the inward part." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I really desire truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that hunger and thirst after the righteous, it shall be what? &gt;&gt; I want truth. I don't want to just go to church and thinking and feel all right and thinking I'm all right. Give me the truth. &gt;&gt; Tell me the truth. If it hurt me, tell me. &gt;&gt; I want truth. &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know, I feel so sorry. I go to funerals and I feel sorry for the people. It sound so pretty cuz everybody going to heaven sound pretty. Amen. The one that sang for the devil all their life talking about they baby and this and that sometime some of the filthy stuff you want to hear but if they have they happen to die they going to hell. I tell you something. Then we'll sing may the life I live speak for me. I wonder which one you talking about. May the life I live speak for me. Which one? &gt;&gt; That life you live, you lived it right there for the devil and you never, you know, you didn't talk about Jesus. You didn't reflect the light of God or nothing. But all of a sudden, you die, you going to heaven. Oh, they have a big show, big service, and even the the Oh, Lord, am I delusional? Is my mind correct? Am I thinking correct? Or am I in a delusion? Not just a delusion. He said strong. &gt;&gt; He says it be a fallen away first. Not just stop coming to church. Amen. But spiritually, people have fell so far away from God. What used to be right ain't right no more. what used to be people don't they look like there's no respect for the Bible &gt;&gt; they do what they want and then worship God just how they want to do it and when it come down you show them Bible they say well that ain't what we believe that ain't what we believe you know we I I I tend to believe this okay let me see why people believe like they leading fallen away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition. Who opposes and exalt himself above all that is called what? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; God. People think they God. Ah I'm spiritual. I you know I believe in spirit. I believe in God cuz they make themselves God. Uh that is worship. So that he as God sat in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. Remember ye not that when I was yet with you, I told you of these things. And now ye know what was holding that he might be revealed in its time. For the mystery of iniquity doeth what? &gt;&gt; See, he's talking about over 2,000 years ago. The mystery of iniquity was already working. Iniquity is something that you know better and you still do it. &gt;&gt; Some people know they wrong, but they still do it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, God will forgive me of everything except for blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. So, iniquity. I know I'm wrong, but all you got to do is pray. You think you can play with God like that? Before I go to bed at night, I might have drank all night and I might have laid up with somebody wife and all this and that. But all I got to do ask God to forgive me for I go to sleep and God forgive. You going to control God. Don't play with God. &gt;&gt; It's a time that we get cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Time that we get our lives in order. Clean me, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wash me that I may clean. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need to be washed. &gt;&gt; Amen. For I acknowledge my transgressions. &gt;&gt; I know I'm wrong. Lord, have mercy on me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Renew a right spirit within me, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need to get right with you, God. I don't want to play around. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, just you don't know what they done before they died and all that. Praise God. Dean them and God trying to wish everybody go to heaven. But you know, I know it's not going to be because broad is the way to lead to destruction. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Narrow and straight. If we got a chance to live right, let's do right. &gt;&gt; While you living, cuz when you're dead, you ain't going to be able to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think somebody said it's better to have a live dog than a dead lion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So by the grace of God, the mystery of iniquity already work. Only he that not let it will let until he be taken out of the way. One day the holy sp holy ghost going to be taken. The holy spirit going to be taken. And the way the world going through all these floods and all this stuff going on, these fires, everything. Oh Lord, mass killings and all of that.

All of us ain't just just going to heaven now. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to have some oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; You got to have all cuz the five was wise and five foolish. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Everybody come to church don't want to serve God right. &gt;&gt; They're right in their head and they think they right. But sometime we got to live right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. I correction I got all the time. Not sometime. &gt;&gt; Thank you brother Fred. &gt;&gt; You got to live right all the time.

He and then shall the wicked be what? &gt;&gt; The wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the what? &gt;&gt; Spirit of his mouth. &gt;&gt; Spirit of his mouth. He's coming.

One day God going to come. &gt;&gt; This world going to burn like an oven. Going turn it upside down like a drunk man. God don't come and judge the world in righteousness. It's coming. You see the signs of it coming. Every day it getting worse and worse. &gt;&gt; America is under the judgments of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they won't turn and repent. Judgment is striking. Amen. All over the world. It's sad to see. Amen. So many children running. So many people going through. Amen. The fires and the storms. It's a sad occasion. Amen. &gt;&gt; My heart's bleed, but this judgment is hitting the earth. &gt;&gt; God is calling out that, "Why don't you repent of your sin?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There'll be some that will repent and say, "God, I've been living wrong. I've done wrong. I need you, Jesus. Forgive me, Lord." &gt;&gt; Well, will America as a whole repent? No. But there'll be some that will repent of their sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin. And the promise is you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. There'll be some that were repaired of their sins and they'll turn to God because they know, Amen. They see the signs of the coming of the Lord. They see the signs of the time and they'll Amen. They run while they have a chance and get in Christ before it's too late. &gt;&gt; One day you'll wake up and it'll be too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Said at the funeral yesterday, uh my sister-in-law brother just went home sitting on the porch and death came by. didn't know death would come by. Then we all go through a little sadness this morning is brother Carol passing away because the sometimes it's unexpected. You don't know when, you don't know how, but you got to be ready. &gt;&gt; You got to be ready. So I'm saying get your life in order. &gt;&gt; Get your life in order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan would do some stuff to try to deceive you. The Bible says God's going to consume him with the spirit of his mouth, the brightness of his coming. I believe God is coming to shine a bright light in this hour. It's consuming all that false stuff cuz God is revealing Satan and where he's hiding it. He been hiding a long time, but God has revealed, exposed him. True. Amen. &gt;&gt; John talked about the spirit of Antichrist was already working. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But the Antichrist was coming. I believe he'll show up soon. And I believe that those that are not in Christ, it'll be too late then. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have to receive the mark of the beast that they all might be damn. Oh, I got ahead of myself. Let me let me just going to read in the 10th verse. He no ninth verse. He says, "Even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all what?" &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, the devil should deceive him. and with all deceveness of unrighteousness and them that what? &gt;&gt; Perish. &gt;&gt; Perish. You deceive them that they're going to perish because they receive not what the truth. &gt;&gt; See, you tell the people the truth. A woman ought not to be preaching. They don't love that. You trying to say to man, you're male showing this. You're this, you're that. Homosexuality is wrong. Everybody, you don't know what God made me this way. That's all right. God made some people some people's bone liars. Amen. Somebody was born, you know, born with me. I got a big head. I ain't had nothing to do with it. I was just born with a big head. You know what I'm saying? Some people are just born. Amen. &gt;&gt; But h I'm glad I could be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was born a sinner. How about you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God But I'm so glad there's a savior there to save me from my sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I can be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; See what I'm saying? It We can't help how we were born, but we can help. Amen. We can receive a new birth and be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can receive Jesus Christ. No matter what kind of shape we were in, Jesus will Amen. turn amen the darkness into light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus can make the valley a mountain and he can bring Amen. the mountain down to the valley. &gt;&gt; He can make the crooked straight &gt;&gt; if you allow him to do it. Ain't that right? So don't worry about a thing. God is able &gt;&gt; to save us to the utmost. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what condition you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll save and heals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz they didn't love the truth that they might be saved. They go to church. I ain't going to that church. I I don't want to look like those people and I don't believe what they believe. So I ain't going. They ain't going to tell me nothing. I know God and God didn't speak to me tell me that. The Bible said it. The Bible said in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said we we were held him as he was grace and truth. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man can come to the father but by me. You who you think you are, you know, humble yourself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see what the word say. I want to do what you say, Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh well, God, you got to listen to me. I had one big preacher, one of the biggest churches in Colombia, and the preacher said, "Ah, when sister so and so get to heaven, she ain't going to say, I want to see Paul. I I want to see Jesus." She said, "I want to see Paul because I'm going to straighten you out concerning women preachers and all those people." I said, "Goodness, y'all. Y'all must you mean to tell me this this sister going to straighten Paul out? Paul didn't preach what he wanted to preach. It was the word of God. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Paul. It was God that was saying that it's in the Bible. That's the word was God. Those people they clapping their hand. I said, "Man, you with your doctor degree and all of your religion, you going to sit down and you got enough nerve to say something like that in the pullpit. I lost all respect of you." It could have most of those people should have walked out. Could have jumped up and walked out. But you know what? They sat right there, clapped their hand, believed that she going to straighten Paul out. I said, "Did I hear with my ears?" Oh, God. We we're in a a a a delusion a world and people go to church and set up under because they got a doctor degree and because they can articulate good and maybe amen they got a good choir and good this and good that and maybe hundreds and maybe thousands going there. So we believe that that's truth because the crowd is going there. The big shots. Are you with me? But it'll be so simple. Amen. It'll be straight and it'll be narrow. Few going to find that. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because most people don't want it. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he came into his own his own what? &gt;&gt; They didn't want it. He was in the world. The world was made by. But the world didn't know him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's in the church and the church put him on the outside. So, we don't want him in here. He's He's speaking to our heart, but we don't want him in our hearts. We don't want him in our lives because we want to be in control of our own life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We want to do what we think is right. We want to be in control him, not he control us. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Y'all better I I got to This ain't a Sunday morning message, but he's on my heart because my heart is bleeding. One day I have to give an answer to God. One day I'm going to have to stand up and say, "God," he going to say, "Why didn't you tell him the truth?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, I don't want to be guilty. I've been to too many funerals lately to be guilty of telling the people the truth. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Some people don't want to line up with the word. They want the word to line up with them. Praise God. God don't have to. You can't make God no better than he is. &gt;&gt; If God said, Amen. It'll last throughout eternity. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, I was singing this song, everything going down but the word of God. &gt;&gt; Everything going down, but the word is going to stand. When it's all over, &gt;&gt; word of God still be there. &gt;&gt; Get in the word and stay there. &gt;&gt; Be ready when Jesus come. &gt;&gt; Get in that word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't play around with your soul. &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by any means. that that day would not come except there be a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; That little man will try to sit in the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll try to set in your heart and he'll try to deceive you. &gt;&gt; But you got to love the truth. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I love the truth. &gt;&gt; Lord, I love the truth. &gt;&gt; I'm concerned. Every hurt, I'm love the truth. I want to know the truth. &gt;&gt; I admit it just to walk out because you tell him the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, it's abomination in the sight of God for a woman the way that was attained to a man. I'm gone. &gt;&gt; Bless Jesus. &gt;&gt; I gone. No, no, don't tell. Don't tell me that. I do what I want. People are stubborn. They're heady. High minded. You can't tell them because somebody going to tell them it's all right. It's all right. You don't have to do all that. You come here, you can go to heaven. I We got a way that you can go. Yeah. I mean, we we we we got we got we got we we we got something going on with God and and God will let you in. Don't listen to that old false crazy preacher. Come on in here. Yeah. Come on. Got a way you can get in heaven. You ain't got to do all that. They talking about that old time religion. Grandmama don't used to do all that stuff. You ain't got to do it. Come on. Oh yes. They're telling you going to be all right. I'm glad you got off from one of those crazy people. People ain't got good sense. Talking about holiness. Talking about living a godly life and being perfect. Ain't nobody can be perfect. And who you who you don't be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect. Who said that? Jesus, right? Well, why you want to Well, you mad at Jesus and tell Jesus I can't be perfect. He said be perfect. &gt;&gt; He said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; But if he said be, he must have made a provision how you can be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said be holy for I am what? &gt;&gt; Holy. So he must made provision that you can be holy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, I I done went too long this morning. There's a whole lot of people going to turn turn me off. Turn you off. I can't can't listen to no more. Are you with me? But I tell you what, I feel the judgment of God striking the earth. And I feel like it's going to be any moment I got to tell the people now. Cuz if I don't tell them now, I don't want them. God going to hold me responsible. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't want to be responsible for not telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; I'm going tell you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It may be a few go and few some might fall out with me and hate me for now, but there'll be others that say, "Thank you for telling me the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May not be but a few, but there'll be one some that say, "I want to know the truth." &gt;&gt; Praise God. I ain't worried about how much money you give and how much you want to give, and it doesn't make that difference with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there'll be some uh that's going to uh be charger because they want 50 ler. They want your money. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we ain't worried about that. &gt;&gt; We want you to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Want you to live right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you don't give a dime, want your soul to be right with God, &gt;&gt; it's going to work out all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sad. I'm sad. My heart bleeds. I'm not upset with people, but these preachers, Lord have mercy, I'm kind of they they they do a good job deceiving, man. I couldn't even I couldn't even I preach them. No. No way. Cuz they know they they know they in school. They know how to get to your mind. But they they telling you the truth. Oh boy. They can articulate. They can make it so good. And you said, "Well, that's kind of that's good preaching." It's good preaching, but is it good to your soul? Okay. Love the truth because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be what? &gt;&gt; Saved. Many tell me those folk ain't saved. The Bible said after saving the children of Israel out of Egypt, he after destroyed them because of what? After Jesus, you've accepted Jesus as your personal savior and he come into your life. Then he wants you to take you into the promised land, the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But after saving the people, they didn't go into the promised land because they didn't believe. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So God after justification, God wanted to sanctify you. clean your life up. But you you just say, "Well, I'm saved. That's enough." But God promised you if you repent of your sin, be baptized in Jesus' name, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. But some people say, "Well, I'm satisfied. I've been baptized. God, Jesus come." No, no, no. Justification, sanctification, then the baptism of the Holy Ghost. God want to clean you up. He want to s justify you, want to save you, then he want to sanctify you, clean your life up. Then he want to fill you up with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But if you don't want to be all I want to be, I'm saved and I know I'm saved. Still smoking, drinking, running around, and you ain't sanctified yet. I know I accepted Jesus. You did. You did. But that was all in your head. It didn't change your life. It's intellectual. You did just what the preacher said, the church say, but you didn't do what God said. He said if thou can you confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ and believe in thy heart. So it didn't go down in your heart. Because it went down in the heart then you're going to go on keep on believing. &gt;&gt; There's going to be changes in your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to go back home and still do the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Okay. Leave me alone. Leave these people alone. I hope you just preach about the joy of the Lord and Jesus died for the sin to leave the people alone. People don't want you to leave them alone. Let the people just come to you want to run everybody off. You be here by yourself at the bar. Are you with me? I'm not trying to run people off. I'm trying to tell you the truth. Are you with me? You say, "Well, you're doing a good job at Well, no. I had eight, right? That's all went in. The whole world and just eight people were saved." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Going out of Sodom, no city probably full of people. But it only how many? Three. They had four, but one looked back. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; The Bible said after Oh, Lord. I ain't trying to justify nothing. Just tell the people the truth. That's all I Okay. The 11th verse. I'm I'm I'm about to close. He says, "And for this cause God shall send them what? &gt;&gt; Strongusion &gt;&gt; that they shall believe what? &gt;&gt; A lie." &gt;&gt; People had their opportunity. These preachers, the people had their opportunities, but they didn't love the truth. They had the opportunity. They They had the opportunity to believe the truth and to accept the truth. They had the opportunity, but because they didn't love the truth, God sent them a strong delusion that they might believe what &gt;&gt; you sitting on the borderline right now questioning God's word. right on the border line of the promises of God, God taking you, Amen, and really baptizing you with the Holy Ghost and filling you with his spirit, but you're on the border line just like Israel came up to the border line. They knew that the land flowed in milk and honey cuz they had evidence of it. They knew that what God promised was real, but they didn't go in because they talking about the giants in the land. Oh, you got to live this way. You got to live that way. You can't do this. You can't do that. The giants in the land. The walls are high. The Oh, you the judge sites, the pious sites, the habits, and all of that is in the land. The Canaanites. Oh, we ain't able to go over there. God said, "I give you the land. I ain't able to live right. I can't do it. I I ain't gonna do all of that." Oh, but as others say, Lord, I want the truth. If you told me to do it, Amen. then I'm going to take this land and Amen. It flows with milk and honey. You gave it to me. Those old Canaanites, Habites, and all, they on my property. Amen. All these demons, Amen. Amen. That possessing your life. Amen. I want to be sanctified. God clean my life up. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many spirits, Amen, that inhab. I want to be holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be in heaven places in Christ Jesus. I want the glory of the Lord. I want the power of God in my life. Lord, I want you to use me. Amen. I want to praise you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to be in the kingdom. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm coming on, Lord. I'm coming, Lord. That the king. Amen. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Lord, I want the Holy Ghost experience. Lord, give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh Lord, coming on in my promised land. &gt;&gt; I want the promise. Amen. I want it. Give it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, whatever it takes, I want it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a set back in. You know how many went said they can make, Lord, I I want it. The other 10 said, "No, no, y'all can't have it." You know how many churches you can go to tell you you can't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can't live the a godly life and a holy life. But there are just two Joshua and Caleb. Amen. Joshua type of the Holy Ghost and Caleb is a type of the true believer. Are you with me? Those two saying, "We we more than able. Yes. Yes, you can live holy in this hour. Yes, God still heals. Yes, God still saves to the utmost. &gt;&gt; I want it." &gt;&gt; And all the devils in hell can't stop me now. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want mine. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many millions stop believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care who don't trust him. I trust God. &gt;&gt; God, you my savior. &gt;&gt; You brought me this far &gt;&gt; and I don't believe you brought me this far to leave me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. You bought you. Hey, God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know too much about him now. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's good to me. &gt;&gt; Lord, if you bought me out, you can take me in. &gt;&gt; If you bought me out of sin, God, you can fill me with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, you can. Hey, I don't need what the Egyptians had. &gt;&gt; I don't need the golden calf. I don't need what they had in Egypt. &gt;&gt; I need what God promised me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I need his divine nature. I want the Holy Ghost. I want the power of God in my life. I want to see Jesus glorified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can have the whole world, &gt;&gt; but give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. I want Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God send them a throne delusion that they should believe the lie. Eli. Amen. Praise God. He said that they might be damned. He said that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had what? Praise God. Is this holy life? Isn't this better than what you had? &gt;&gt; This life is better. How many How many know it's better? &gt;&gt; Praise God. I know Josh witness.

I I won't take nothing for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is this better, sister boy? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; This is a better life. What I look at people, I say, "Well, you mean to tell me you give up God for that? &gt;&gt; You give up coming to church for that?" Oh, no. No, no, no. You can go. Oh, you know, you ain't talking me out to God. &gt;&gt; Cuz this is way better than what you got. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you love pleasure, but I love God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't mind. I know it better. &gt;&gt; Amen. I done tried that way, but you got to try this way. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I had enough of that. &gt;&gt; But thank God I can't get enough of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I tell he's good. Let us stand. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those people are delusional. think they can serve God and live any kind of way and go to church and the preacher tell them all you got to do is pray and do all that filth and all that ungodly stuff and your life never is changed. There's no victory in your life. You don't overcome nothing. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You got to be overcomers, brother, sister, &gt;&gt; friend. You got to Amen. leave this whole world behind. in the things of the world. All that's in the world, lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. These things are not of the father, but of the world. You got to let the world look. I don't want it. I don't want it. I want God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. And he said, what? All other things he'll give to you. &gt;&gt; Just let him be first in your life. Let him be Lord of your life. &gt;&gt; Let him rule. Let him abide. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not against nobody. &gt;&gt; I just want them to know the truth. I love them just as much. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I love them. Just want to see them. I don't want the devil to deceive them. I don't want them to think they're their right and turn down truth. They turn down truth to believe the lie. The lie of the devil. Don't turn it down, brothers and sisters. You can be tempted. The devil fight your mind, battle you, tempt you, but realize there's something deep down in your soul. I've been ordained for before the foundation of the world. God foresaw me in. I know he did. Why? Cuz he just won't let me go. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He just won't let me go. Something inside of me bear witness with the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said they that are of the truth. He said they hear my what? Voice. &gt;&gt; Didn't he say that when I read it, John? that they they that are of the truth will hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is God's voice? It's his word. Amen. You're going to hear God's word &gt;&gt; and believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may not understand it all, but you just believe it. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if you're of the truth, you going to hear it. Amen. The others, they they look like they can't even comprehend it. They just put it their hands over their ears. They don't want to hear it. Praise God. But those that are of the truth, Jesus said they hear my voice as our heads bow, hearts are looking to him. [Music] You may heard the preacher say things this morning, but what is your heart? Is your heart hearing you? It is that little small still voice that tells you what truth is. That the same voice that tell you if you about to do something wrong, said don't do it. But that same voice is saying to you this morning, my sheep know my voice. and a stranger they would not follow. Lord, I desire truth from the inward part. I want to to know the truth for you said the truth will make me free. Not just church, not just joining the church, but I want God. I want the true and living God. I want you to live in me, Lord. [Music] Lord, let my life reflect your truth. Your word might radiate and might shine through me. [Music] For thy word is a lamp unto my feet, light to my path, and the word of a hidden my heart that I might not sin against you. [Music] I wonder this morning as our heads are bowed hard to look into him, the truth. Am I in the truth? Are you in Christ or you just in the church? Are you in the kingdom of Jesus Christ or you just going to church? For he said, "My kingdom is not of this world." Colossians tells us he delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. Have you been translated or do you want to be translated this morning? Can God amen you from the powers of darkness? Translate you into the kingdom of his dear son. Would there be one today that would lift your hand, pray for me, pastor, I need to be translated into his kingdom. I want to your heads up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Translate me. Thank you. Thank you. I want that to be born again. I want the Holy Ghost. I want God in my life. God, I know you're real. I know you spoke to my heart. Uh know my needs, Lord. I need you, Lord. Lord, fill me with your spirit, Lord. Come into my heart. Make me over, Lord. Baptize me with your spirit. I need power. I need faith. I need you, Lord. Help me, Lord.

We pray that you'll bless the blessed congregation as they leave your presence, but never leave your presence, but always abide in thee, oh Lord.
