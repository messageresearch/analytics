god praise god praise god praise god oh praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god amen is it not amazing to worship your maker it's great to acknowledge your purpose on it and i believe jesus is glad tonight jesus is rejoicing tonight because he can see the essence of calvary he can see these trophies and jesus is now rejoicing that cover indeed paid off because he has gotten us and we tell the lord that we have also recognized what he is required of us he desires your worship so if you have really recognized what god is demanding from us then we must call ourselves the most privileged people tonight to come into his presence and worship him let us pray precious lord we are thankful tonight that we can recognize [Music] the need to get into the presence of god no man could make it no man could come unto you except you draw him so if you have been drawn tonight into your presence it means is the grace of god that has really reached each one of us so father we are here to worship we are here to hear the voice of god we are here to receive so come among your people tonight and further bring the bread in your very special way that we can recognize you bless each one of us and let the holy spirit take over this service we are looking forward for your presence to be felt among us tonight in the name of jesus christ amen okay while i may be standing maybe you want to tell your bible with me let us read a scripture i take my reading from the book of matthew matthew chapter 12. matthew chapter 12 i'm reading from 38 verse to 42 then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees and said say master we will see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation secret after a son and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for us jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the eighth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with degeneration and shall condemn it because they repented after the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the utmost powers of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here may the lord add blessing to read of his word you can have your sins i'm very grateful for this opportunity again to be with you i called bro simon but maybe a couple of weeks about two weeks ago and i let him know that i'm around the country so he just looked at his calendar and finally he's settled on this day for me to come over and then speak to the church so return the love for that hand of fellowship i believe most of you know me anytime around he opened the doors for me to come and then speak to this assembly and i'm very grateful for that hand of fellowship because a man cannot open his puppet for you just like that he has to have some confidence in you that you'll be a blessing to the church so i really appreciate god bless you my friend for this open door that you always grant unto your friend so we are really privileged people because god is in our midst you remember that when israel was journeyed through the promised land a bilam was hired to go and test them but one thing was really astounding when he got he got to do that job god said why not have blessed you cannot cast so when billam went into a higher mountain to see where you can see the whole congregation he could not cast he blessed and what happened he said balak i can hear the voice of the king among them so the voice of the king was among his people and today the voice of the king is among the bride the bride our movement that we are making to the promised land the voice of the king is among us and we cannot deny this voice because we are connected to this voice and this is the voice that is taking us through this journey the voice of the king so this message that we want to really look into tonight that's the scriptural science of the time scripture science of the time israel is mostly concerned about science and god also is very very concerned about science whatever god wants to do he will give a sign and when god gives a sign then he let it out for people that are predicted to see the sign of god in their age and when you see the sun the sun what does the sun does it cause attraction and sun causes attraction so when you see a sign it trusts you that is how god also do to attract his people so that they can recognize the message of their day no israel they are always concerned about science because that's how god presents himself to them so they come over to jesus christ and they ask him master all the prophets they come they give a sign the prophet is a sign so now you have come and a lot of people are really saying you are a messiah messiah but we are the phrases the jew we don't understand these things but here we come give us a sign so that we will know what you are talking about because we want to see a sign from you brethren they have refused their super son the bible said the lord will give you a super sign a virgin shall conceive something that has never happened since god created heaven and hell that a woman to receive seed by herself and bring forth her son that was the super sign that was what they're supposed to look at and god did not just do it in darkness he's poked about a prophet a virgin shall conceive and he shall give you a son and he be called emmanuel interpreted god with us god coming in humanity humanity god came to live among his people god came in that personality to reveal himself to his people as he did in the time of all to father abraham god has to do same to his people and that was the super sign but what did they do they refused to see their sign so jesus told them you are doctors generation you seek after a son the sign that god presented to you you refuse you reject it now you come to look for a son no sign will be given to you by that of jonas as you will refuse your sign this is the time the son of one will go into the earth three days three nights and he'll come out but i want to tell you that son of jonas it is very peculiar to you guys but let me tell you greater than jonas is here greater than jesus what was he trying to tell them he wanted them to know scripturally that god has visited his people brethren prophet said sometimes we don't know our authority we don't know what god has made us of brother you are powerful god has given you something sitting in you anyone that is baptized with the holy ghost brother you are capable to do all things with the holy ghost in you there is nothing that you have to fear that's what god said look he said when you see a man that is filled with the holy ghost brother that man he is typical to even or speak words into existence he is because you are don't pay with christ you have the same quality of jesus christ said you have become equal you are on equal times with jesus christ when you have the holy ghost no then that is why we can rejoice that we are john hare with christ you have that authority you say when you see a policeman on the road and then he lift his hand to stop that big car that truck that is pulling on the road it is not that he has got power but he has got authority he has authority the authority of the whole american state is behind that young man or the slave guy that's the slim man that is on the road you think you can cross him do it and see you can crush him the whole power the whole nation america is behind him and that is what we have to know that you as a son of god the holy ghost certainly you you have authority and when the enemy tries to pounce on you you have authority you have your authority to exercise that authority on the enemy all what you have to do you lift your hand and says hey mr satan stop right there stop ready because you speak with authority that is the son of god that is your position and that is what satan said satan is denying us he don't want us to recognize our place but when you are placed rightly when a son of god is possessing rightly brother you can do all things because you have got to estate a place where all things are possible scripture sign of the time now jesus went ahead and told him you the men of needy will rise and they'll condemn you all because they heard the message of jonah and they repented and the queen of shepherd will also rise in judgment and condemn you this generation because she came from at the most part of the earth when he heard of solomon and he came to identify herself with the gift of that day scripture sign of the time now when they come to jesus remember they ask jesus christ lord if you are the messiah then where is elijah because a liar is supposed to can become before you that is a scripture because there may be a letter to foreground the coming of the lord jesus christ so they have believed that jesus is christ and they are following him but one thing was missing they are not able to place the scripture they could not really identify or place john the baptist in his appropriate place they couldn't do it so that is why when you read john i mean matthew matthew 17 they asked jesus christ that question matthew 17 10 and describes us him saying why then says the scribe that elias masters come they say elias must first come that is the scripture and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they enlisted like was the also the son of man who suffered of them then the disciples understood that he speak unto them of john the practice which means they could not know they couldn't please join the baptist in the scripture brother the scriptural sign there was an attraction at jordan john the baptist did not go to his father's school he did not go to the denominational staff he didn't join himself with them because he has a special ministry it is not a denominational ministry that is what the bride god has pulled us from denominations he has pulled us from that is all this alternate stuff he has pulled us from pentacles we are above pentacles look at what pentacles they are doing they are messed up it is a doctrine they are rotten but the bride we have moved because the pill of fire has really caused another movement like i spoke to pastor remember john that that martin luther saw the light and he moved john wesley saw the light and he moved pentecostal saw the light and they available at the stuff what look look at what they are doing over there why because there is another movement and they are right in the clutches again they have come into the clutches of denominationalism but we are in the world because the word is christ scripture sign of the time when they went to john the baptist at jordan what happened this man was close with animal skin he was really not like the priest he was not like the cardinals he was not like the proof of the day he was just an ignorant somebody somebody with that good clothing somebody that was not eating good food you understand that was the sign to them where is this man stay staying in the wilderness why has he chosen to stay in the wilderness it was a scriptural sign but they could not see it when you read john chapter 1 verse 19 they went to him are you christ say no are you elijah he said no are you the prophet that we have to look forward he said no then who are you amen brethren scripture son let us read it john chapter one quickly john john chapter 1 verse 19 and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and leavers from jerusalem to ask him who are they and he confess and deny lord but confess i am not the christ and they ask him what then are there elites he said i am not ada that prophet and he answered no they said they on him who are they that we may give an answer to them that sentence what's saying that of that self and he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness mistreat the way of the lord i said the prophet isaiah if you know the scripture if you want to see what god is doing in your day you must look into the scripture beloved that is why it is important for you to know your place it is not you a church member you are a way you have become the word of god you are the experienced image of christ today you must know your position if you open the scripture and you don't see your position in the scripture then something is missing you must say your name you must see your place that is why john when the book was opened and john saw his name the bible said he stopped weaving he stopped waving and say hallelujah he said oh the whole christian heard me say amen because he saw his name therefore if you see your name in the scripture you are identified with christ and you are part of the world and there's nothing that can stop you scratch your son so you you know that you are identified with christ you are not a church member you are not a member of any church you are a member of christ people prefer to take membership in churches brother if you come to each the prophets it is good to come to church but when you come to church move further and move into christ scripture son don't say brethren what is wrong with you you have come to the world that you have heard a voice a voice is crying in the wilderness and you are asking me who are you so what don't you know isaiah spoke of this you know as i spoke of this and you have heard of what's crying in the world that you cannot look into the scripture and appropriately put me right in the scripture if you can't see me are you blind if you care to know if you don't know how to play that i want to tell you go and read as i i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness i am brother and every sign there is a voice so the sign of john the baptist staying in the wilderness with animal skin eating all those stuff remember he was right in that wilderness to be assigned to the people but when they got there it is no more the sign look at the voice when you get into that environment the cell has caused the attraction all right but after the attraction what comes out it is the voice that comes hallelujah oh my oh man oh god i'm sorry i didn't i didn't see you i'm really oh god bless you my friend i didn't know my friend is here brethren so the voice is what is important so what did the voice say repent for the kingdom of god is at hand and those people that were predicted for the kingdom when they heard that voice they did not really stay with their attraction again the attraction has only got a pull on them it pulled them to the wilderness so the attraction has finished its purpose and the purpose and what is important for them is the voice and the voice is placing them in the scripture letting them know that the kingdom of god is saturn scripture sign of the time amen so you see elijah why did john say i am not if you have not got a prophet to be honest with you if god has not sent a prophet you are being a mess let us be honest to ourselves god has to send a scripture a prophet so that he will do the blessing it is the way that pleases us and the word of god comes to the prophet and when the prophet gets the word and the people has messed up the word of god brings them back in the days of election he was assigned to the people and when they met up a ledger admin you read first king chapter 18 and let us say lord let it be known that i'm the prophet i am turning the house of people these people back to god that is exactly the ministry of elijah brethren and john he said i am not like there was a muslim preaching in my village he said you see your scripture your scripture is never correct yes this bible you guys are holding it is really full of contradictions how can elijah himself join the baptist say i am not elijah and jesus comes he said no no no no no no he is elijah so the muslim they took it and it was really a trump card for them and they said have you seen your scripture the man himself said i am not jesus comes he said he is who is telling the truth but thank god that god sent a prophet that is why we are above pentacles because blessed are your eyes that you can see these things and understand these things because the mystery of the kingdom is being let out to the bride to you but to them it is in parables it remains in parables because according to psalms he said i will open my mouth after 1978 there i will open my mouth and i will speak in parables and after he has spoken in parables then the disciples will go privately to him master those things you spoke please we didn't understand so we have come then jesus will tell them has all the people gone he said they have all gone has all the phrases everybody gone is the ira gun are you by yourself alone he said then sit down then you explain in detail plain language to them and you tell them to you it is given but to them it's not giving i was preaching in ghana i have some horns on my church and i always preach to the people in the community i say imagine look at when jesus christ spoke about the parable of the sower the one that sold his seed and then somebody comes out around by night and so bad wheeze among the seed you understand and then this man slept and then in the night this one sleek sneaky and then he sold tears among the witch and jesus christ said when the reapers are his servant so if they wanted to go and approach the whis but he said no no no you don't do it leave it let them grow together until you harvest time then i will charge the reapers first to get the tears the whis has to be to be them first and thereafter you get me the seed that is all what jesus said and all the people left and when we read the scripture after they have all gone so pastor if those people that are going what are they going with they are going with parable they are going with parable they don't understand when somebody meet them on the road what was the service what did the man preach this afternoon oh jesus you know this might always say story stories here you don't understand what he was talking he was just telling stories he said so somebody took a took seed he went and saw and all this kind of stuff and somebody so bad series that's all what he was talking about that is what they had and that is what they can report but the disciples stay with jesus and jesus told them the sower is the son of man the seed is the children of the kingdom of god and the tears are the wicked ones and the one that saw them is satan so friends if both people are going to preach the phrases that had a parable they will preach a parable they'll say oh we heard the stories and but when peter is going to preach he'll pray that the weed is the the sons of the wicked one because it has been interpreted to him scripture son of the time john the baptist was a scripture son and the reason he said i am not elijah the prophet made us to understand that because they asked him are you the elijah that is to come to restore all things are you the elijah that is coming malachi 4. he said no no no no don't put me in the wrong place you must not dislocate all this misplaced no put me at the appropriate i am not that one don't do that to me you understand that is why he rejected and he said no i am not because he cannot break the scripture a lecture another is doing five things five times it's coming five times elijah elisha john the baptist malacca for william branham and then revelation 11 moses and elijah so beloved that is why he rejected he said no no no i'm not because they were placing him in malachi 4. scripture sign and here jesus comes a virgin has conceived indeed and they have seen it but what was their problem the problem with the phrases is not that they don't believe that a virgin shall conceive they believe it is as it is as the voice of the prophet so they believe but the problem with them is that joseph was always moving with mary that was their problem and problem said if god wants to do anything he will create a room for people to criticize that's how god does his things if you are here to criticize this man you get many criticism if you are here to criticize this message you will get a lot to criticize if you are here to criticize the deacons you get a lot to criticize but if you're here to see jesus i bet you you see jesus it depends what you are here for you understand so jesus christ scripture has fulfilled that a veggies are conceived but because god wants to knock out the critics he allowed mary not to be by herself joseph has already engaged her so that the critics will disbelieve that's how god does his work that is why when we read john 8 41 they told jesus in his faith we are not born of fornication like you you are not born of any kind like you that is why they didn't believe not that they don't believe the scripture and that is how god also make it if you are not careful god will really something will happen and read the people that say we believe this message it will become it will get to a place if you are not careful we will also be in the same category no scripture sound of the time we know that in the days of noah he was assigned to the people but what happened to them they rejected the offer no one has really made a way of escape to the people and he has preached for several years calling them in but the people refused he was a sign and the act was a sign to them this is the act this is the deliverance this is your deliverance come into the act this is the only safety zone but the people refuse they refuse your son and whenever you refuse your son and the voice what comes after his judgment as judgment so israel they were much particular about science not to listen to intellectual speech that is what we are here for we don't want to hear intellectual speech we don't want to hear people that can really oh scream or maybe shout out to the most we want to hear the word of god we want to see the scripture sign we want to teach the vindication he said by my name he shall do these things we want to see practically god among his people brethren that's what we want to see and it is the prophet said the problem is not the word of god the problem is you and me we are the problem because god is wanting a place to live god is looking for somebody to be a tool in his hand and you have denying god that's right if you can avail yourself and give your life to jesus christ jesus here i am father use me let us see what god has gotten out of you let us see what will happen to your life if you can surrender like what pastor was talking why don't we see the power of god in the church again it is because we have relaxed we don't pray like we pray before we don't fast like the first people we have relaxed and we we have taken things for granted but it is time for us to visit the old days again because we want to see god in in his people you see down there god has announced you to prophesy in the church because you are lazy you don't prophesy again and then you are denying the church the benefit that you have to derive to get from your gift you are denying us you don't prophesy again you don't speak in tongues again and you come and sit in the church and say the church is not on fire they touch yourself on fire it is sacrificed because you have quenched the fire you you quench the fire may god have mercy on us scripture sign of this time they refuse to go in and now noah i mean jonas look at jonas the prophet said jonas was in in line of duty people said that he was running away to anyway no god was preparing a special that is offer for in any way believe it he has been sent to that is anyway then he when he went to the beach or he went to the seashore that the people were just calling taxes taxes taxes taxes that is what is happening today the people are looking for membership they are not looking for candidates of heaven they don't need they are not looking for people that can go to heaven people that we can relationship and address and then we dress them with the government of salvation they don't need those candidates they didn't know those people they are looking for members paints all over their faces come in pants oh come in oh stomach being open oh coming breast open oh coming come in like i was in south africa john is back this is the assembly of god church penn coaster church it was an eyesore it was horrible something that i saw in the church right in the morning they were shared they were they they were giving communion you know how they do it early in the morning they were giving communion and the communion bread for them to give it to a man or a dick in somebody that is really holy holy man to hold the bread no they call a beautiful sister to hold their bread and before you let me say it was horrible because this woman their breasts you know they did the the dress they saw and they they did intentionally cut their breasts here they cut it and that's what that that sister was wearing the breast was caught i'm sorry even no brazer nothing the whole black breast was exposed and he was holding the bread they are so rotted that they don't see anything wrong in sin because they have been swallowed in sin they don't see their eyes are blunt i said what is happening here are these people going to watch breasts or they are going to take bread breathing it was sad and my friend asked me can you join the lie and say no no not me not me look at moses moses was really comfortable for several years in in in pharaoh's palace but he recognized that he is not one of them so he has to associate himself with the slips because he identify himself with the sleeves he said i'm one of them he went to the camp we know the story how he killed an egyptian brother when you kill egyptian then he has to run away because he was wanted and god was also wanting him so moses was a wanted man wanted by god he was wanted in in egypt and he was wanted by god that's how sometimes god does it he'll place some problems on you and then you will run to meet and god will get you at a good environment to deal with you so moses sees the process running away and then he stayed first for 40 40 years in training then one day in the wilderness he saw a burning bush and when he saw this burning bush what happened he was attracted because it was a sign so when he came over to look at the sign then he moved further he said i want to make sure what is happening to this tree this lips then a voice book stand right there moses that voice called his name say wow stay right there remove your shoes where you are standing is the holy ground the prophet said not the ground was holy but the holy ghost was lost right there it was not the ground but the holy god has come underground that is why you are not holy but when the holy ghost comes upon your life you are a holy man because the holy god is certainly you brethren then when he saw the sun and he attracted him then a voice came out of the fire so now moses consent has now left the fire his concern is not concentrated on the voice and what did the voice say i am the god of abraham i am the god of isaac i am the god of jacob i made a promise to abraham and i have remembered my promise and i have come down to confirm my promise moses said wow this is a scriptural voice that is how we identify it when the voice doesn't pinpoint it doesn't point you back to the scripture leave it but he saw that it was a scripture voice he was attracted and the voice was a scriptural voice and moses he said what do you have in your hand he said i only have a stick god said it is enough brother whatever you have whatever you present to god is enough if you present your heart do not present your strength to god present your heart like brad brown said something presented his strength to god but his heart he gave it to the lord give god your heart so when you get moses what do you have a sense take gossip just drop it when you drop the stick it is it was no more music when you hold something and you drop it it is no more for you moses slap the stick out of his hand and he turned into snake and god said take it again when he took it it was god's road it was god's take no more was his take it has become a judgment stick the judgment ruled and then he said if they would not believe the first sign and the voice in this son it is a scriptural voice it's a miracle and if they will not believe it then put your hand in your bosom let proceed put it back healing he said if they will not believe the first son and the voice they will believe the second son and the voice if they will not believe the second son the boy then take water and then let the waters of egypt turn into blood judgment after you refuse the first sign the second sign and then you don't take the ten sun is judgment that's a blah blah blah souls that are in prison now hallelujah brethren judgment follows after you reject the voice of god the same thing is happening today people are refusing our sign now we must look at the scripture let us not really look at any church or any denomination let us look at the scripture and then let us identify the scripture of our day now we see god when jonah got to the beach and then he joined the ship of texas they got into the middle of the way they see trouble happen brother when you go and join the wrong church something will happen because you are in the wrong place and they will throw you overboard they'll throw you down they'll close like the one that was born blind he was in the wrong place when they threw him out because he was convinced that jesus christ is the messiah he said one thing i know if you say he's a sinner i don't care you can call him a sinner that's not my problem but one thing i know that i was planned but now i see that is all what i came to know so britain when they wanted to identify who are in this ship who are in this church then they started to look for people's identity then jonah was busy sleeping careless he didn't care what was happening that is most of us we are sleeping it is time to wake up because there is danger there is something on the sea there is something happening brother let us not sleep let us awake the big donor a slipper what you don't know what is happening he cleans so what is wrong so that sheep is sinking you don't see it he said i'm the problem look at my password i'm going to in any way this is my password this is my visa but why should we join this ship he said by when i got to the beach you were just calling tash's dashes why didn't you look at my passport president threw me into the sea and they were really trying to save this man's life he said you can't make it i know what i'm talking throw me into the sea he threw him and behold god has prepared a sheep he has prepared a fish like somebody told the prophet that there is no science has proved it wrong because the truth of the will a human being cannot go through problems my friend that was not the whale we are talking about god prepared a special fish he prepared a special fish he take he take this man of god to to to nineveh and then he vomit him he brings him out he bring the tongue and the people were celebrating they were so celebrated whole people maybe they were at home they saw a man walking on a tongue of a wheel comes out it was a sign that was the sign and when they got the sign what happened there was a voice jonah said repent or you perish and the people they listened to the voice of jonas because they saw that their god has presented them a message and that's how they all were in sacrament they believed and they mourned they wept for forgiveness jesus said greater than jonas is here they saw their son and many would believe when they saw the sign of their god presenting a man to them but israel god is presenting a man to you you cannot see it but a whale presenting a mountain anyway they saw it and they believe that this is the sign of our god beloved he said the the queen of sheba he would rise and condemn this generation because he had the fame of jo the solomon he had the good news that god has come to live in a human being israel that god has come down he always hear the news when the travelers all the businessmen will be coming from palestine he will he always hear those good news and he has been asking them what is happening in jerusalem it is fantastic wonderful their god has come down and there is nothing that you can keep it secret from that man he knows everything so this woman shepherd said no i can't stay something begin to burn in hey brother when you hear about god when you hear about jesus and you a product you are a candidate you are a son of god there is nothing that can stop you nobody can stop you you are hungry for god you want to get into god nothing can stop you they told the screen you can do it look at our gods we also have that gun we have all these gods around us where should you go and associate yourself with that kind of stuff we don't do that don't go and mingle yourself with israel don't do it we are also a denomination we also have our gods here he said what do you mean i've seen this god since my my my my i was born all these gods have been hung on the on the walls they are being hanged all over the world they can't speak they can't do anything and you want me to stay and then be watching this world i want to go and see a god that can speak so he get herself ready to go and he went and when he was presented to solomon nothing was hidden solomon told hey all about her you are a queen you came from sheba this and that but when the sign was affected on israel when jesus come and then he really told them their name he told them the son what did they say you are visible you are baseball then he said if you are calling me bezebed the queen of sheba will rise in judgment against you because she came from the atomos part of the earth and he saw the wisdom of solomon and he supported the work of god he gave her her presence when you see the movement of god supported support god's work and he said blessed are your people that stand up beside you and they see these things continually they see the signs while they are blessed and if you sit in this message and you see this thing continually and you don't know what you are blessed of you don't know what god has made you of you don't know that you are blessed to see this message to understand these mysteries make a half mess as we close brethren this end time god has revealed himself to us let us not kidding let us not do things to ourselves let us be honest this is a scriptural sign because when we also read malachi 4 you read malachi 4 he said at the end time paul will send as a prophet and you turn our hearts back to pentecostal faith the original faith he will turn the house back to the original faith and that is what brother abraham was announcing on him he came to do same he came to preach the message to turn our house back to the original to preach the message of the hour to unveil christ to us like i speak to pastor it was not about brother it's about christ it is not about you if i want to see christ i come to you and then i see christ in you it is not you again my purpose is to see christ and that is my purpose of coming to you brother i want to see jesus you say brother let me show you jesus your attitude your character how you talk to me i will say that is jesus so brother the prophet came to reveal jesus christ was for closing that is why he said you remember the same way that abraham your father saw a human being in flesh that was a sign the last sign before isaac came was god in flesh is that right that was the last time abraham saw god in the hearing he had saw him in a pill of fire but the last sign god became flesh and walked to abraham then isaac appeared and then he told them that as it was in the days of sodom when jesus came jesus told them your father abraham saw me when he was going to sodom you are not 50 years what are you talking about he said before abraham was i am god has appeared in flesh again he said if you are abram's seed you will recognize me because your father abram saw flesh and you wash my feet but you you see me you carry stone to cast on me you are here to kill me abraham did not do the things you are doing let me tell you to your face that is really the justice that measures it measures you guys that you are not sons of abraham he told them right to their face you are of your father the devil brethren and then luke 70 30 let us be honest with ourselves that as it was in the days of sodom we have sold them with us today and he said ask it to us in the days of sodom in the days of sodom what happened there was a scripture sign a man with two other that is uh personalities they walked to abraham in human flesh abraham was two at the angels the god with two advantages in human flesh problems said in the confirmation recommission he said god took the same dust that he molded up them he molded and three tabernacles he got into one the egg just got into the ida and he moved to abraham and abram saw god in flesh and jesus come again god influenced again make his deck hallelujah revealing himself in flesh and when jesus was influenced the people could not really identify him with the scripture he said this is your scripture son your father abram saw this same thing god in flesh he believed but you have seen me you want to kill me but he told them as it was in the days of sodom and sodom is a gentile that is country a gentile city and we are in sodom so god is dealing with the gentiles today before he deals with israel so sodom my brother america is sodom everything is is in a mess and that is why the whole west they have carried all the spirit american stuff has been carried to africa everywhere why because this is the president america is the present day amorites and when the top of the emirate is full we've got half menstrualness so brethren that is why we have to see the same manifestation of god brethren is not god problem is not christ but that tabernacle that body like you a pastor sitting here god is in him if christ is not him he has got no business yet if you don't have the holy ghost you can come here and pray the message it is the holy ghost that preached it is not human business it is not knowledge it is not intellectual it is the holy ghost beloved so the prophet william branham is not god but brother you cannot drive him you cannot expand him you cannot take him out of the scripture if you take abraham out to the future the scripture is not complete you can't do that he is a scriptural voice of our day malachi 4 restoring us back to that pentecostal faith that's why he prayed the serpent he preached women cannot preach he preached god this one he preached baptism in jesus christ he preached woman is recovering he preached all those kind of message why he was bringing us back to the original faith we are privileged people scripture son of later we are brethren can you see yourself in the scripture can you see yourself in the mirror can you see yourself identify with the scripture of your day we are both pentagons we are private we are the super people on earth today with this message of the hour it has positioned us in a higher dimension that we are sons and daughters of god adopted sons and daughters of god do you love jesus present christ is sitting in you right there so you are an epistle problem said people would not read the bible again but they will read you they will read you if you are walking on the street he said perfect faith produce the goose but people will point their finger on you that is a christian that brother that's a christian go in there amen oh my god half my son yes like somebody a brother came to the to the pastor pastor i want to be baptized he said wow you have stayed for all this while today you want to say yes pastor i want to baptize what happened to you is it the message i preached he said no is it the songs that the people think you say no but what happened to you he said pastor that sounds so good the message was good but there is a brother in our company he is a christian they kick him he will not talk they took they ridiculed they call him names they laugh at him he never kick back i want to be like him hallelujah so we want to be like jesus that is our prayer motive if you want to be like jesus let us be on our feet as we pray scripture sign of the time can you see yourself in the scripture can you see yourself that you are
