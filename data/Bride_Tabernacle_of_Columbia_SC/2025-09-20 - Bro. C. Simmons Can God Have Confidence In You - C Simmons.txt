Move us out of the way that you may get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise. Lord, meet every need that's here and every need that's listening tonight. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. [Music] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we'll turn to the book of Job, chapter 1, a very familiar scripture. [Applause] Job chapter 1 and we'll start in verse verse 6. You got it. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it reads, "Now there was a day when the son of when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan, Whencece comest thou?" Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it?" And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that thou can is that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fearth God and excuseth evil?" Then Satan answered the Lord and said, "Dust Job fear God for not? Hast not thou hast not thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his abundance in in an increased in the land and is increased in the land and his substance is increased in the land. Amen. But put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto ha to Satan, behold, all that he hath is in thy power. All only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. Amen. God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. Tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled, "Can God have confidence in you?" &gt;&gt; Can God have confidence in you? And the prophet of God, I was reading about it and and and he and he said, he said, "Then Satan, the accuser, come up and said it before God." And he said, "Have you considered my servant Job a just man, a perfect man? There's none like him in the whole earth." Think of it. None like him in the whole earth. And he said, "Sure, you got a hedge around him, and that man has got everything. Good health, good strength, and plenty of money, and plenty of everything. Sure, he can serve you." But he said, "Let let me have him a few minutes, and I'll sure take him apart, and I'll make him curse you to your face." But this is the point that I I was reading and it stood out to me. He said, "Now notice, oh, I love this. God knowing the heart. Job had only one way and that's through fellowship. Through the shedding of blood, he had talked to God and he know that he was God had confidence in Job because he had had fellowship with Job. And I thought about it and I was like, can God have confidence in you in such a way? God has such confidence in Job. He said, you devil, you can take everything from him except for his life. He had such confidence in Job because he had had such fellowship with Job. He knew that Job would never leave no matter what. He knew that Job would never doubt no matter what because Job had a real relationship with God. Job had such a strong relationship with God. He knew that nothing the devil could do to dissuade Job from believing that God was still real, that God was still a deliverer, that God was still a savior, God was still a healer, God was still able to do exceedingly abundantly more than he ever thought or could think. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of Joe's relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about it and I said, "Can God have the same confidence in Job? Can he have it in you?" Mhm. &gt;&gt; See, he see it was such a it was such a testimony. Job was such a testimony that the devil had to go to God and say, "Lord, I got to do something about this." Because this is such a testimony of what God can do. &gt;&gt; Job was a living testimony of what God could do. He was a living testimony that God can bless you exceedingly abundantly. He was a living testimony that God could give you give you a great family. That God could bless you with with good health. God could bless you with a good environment. God could bless you with good friends. What Job so thought at that time. But it was he was a living testimony of what God could do. And I wonder sometimes uh when people come and when people come and they have a need, will God send them your way? Bless &gt;&gt; because God has confidence that you're going to lead them in the right way. &gt;&gt; I wonder if he he'll say, you know, go talk to that person while you're going through because God has confidence that you're going to point them in the right direction. &gt;&gt; God has confidence that when they see you, they see him. They God has confidence that you have such a relationship with him that when when when they come to you, you lead them to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's the difference. Job. He didn't turn away from his belief in God. It didn't matter. And see, he got so personal to Job that the devil tried everything he could. He even used the closest persons to him, which was his wife, his wife. And he said, "You, Job, you you everything has been taken from you. Why don't you just curse your God and die?" Just imagine if your closest friend or your parents told you you don't need to believe in that God anymore. That God can't do nothing for you. Just imagine that. But Job had such a relationship with God that he said he told her to to go somewhere with that foolishness because it it was such a real thing to him, his relationship with God. He said, "Lord, though you slay me, yet I trust you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's when you got a different experience with God, that nothing can persuade you or dissuade you that God is real. That God is real to you, not to anybody else. You have to have that experience with him. &gt;&gt; And you have to understand that even though the test and trial may get hard, Lord, I can still stand firm on your word. I can still believe. I can still trust that you're going to do what you said you would do. &gt;&gt; And even if you don't do it, you still been good enough to me that I can still trust you no matter what. &gt;&gt; He said God had confidence in Job because he had had fellowship with Job. And I think about it and I said, "How many times do we have do we spend time with God so that we can have fellowship with God? So that we can get that communion with God that he not only we not only talk to him, but he talks back to us. That we not only see him in the morning, we see him all throughout the day. That we see God walking with us and that hedges around us. That we recognize that God has sent his angels to protect us, to surround us, and he's he's doing his work each and every day. You see, when God God has confidence in you, he sends his presence around you because he realizes that you can't do anything cuz you realize I can't do anything without you, Lord. I can't do anything without you leading me, without you guiding me, without you ordering my steps. &gt;&gt; I can't do anything cuz Lord, I have such high confidence in you that he said, "I I'll pour out my spirit within you." See, see, he he wants a willing vessel that's going to come and say, "Lord, I give you everything." &gt;&gt; And said, and I read further, and he said, he said, "The only way that God can have confidence in you is not because you do something or with your faith you do something, but but when you have fellowship, when you have fellowship with God." And see, God wants to say, I want to have confidence in you so that I can take you higher, so that I can take you on the greater things. You if if you're still on the little silly things, well, still getting upset with people because they said something about you. At certain point, you have to realize that people just going to say what they want to say. &gt;&gt; And then you have to go on about your life, whether it whether it's good or bad, you have to go on because that's not that can't be the thing that hinders you from going to heaven. That can't be the thing that is going to stop you from getting in because you holding something against someone and you won't forgive them because they did something without even sometimes unintentionally knowing that it hurt you. &gt;&gt; And you and sometimes you just got to say, you know what, I have to grow to a a a place that I can go ahead and let that go. &gt;&gt; I have to I said the Lord has been working with me in my life and just understanding that sometimes you have to let people go and it's not that you have something against the person. It's a growth thing. &gt;&gt; It's when you grow and you understand that not all things are supposed to be for forever. It's just a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, if the leaves were to never change, sometimes you would never realize that they could change different colors. But when when you realize that the there's in order for there to be light, there has to be death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for there to be light, there has to be death. And sometimes you got to you got to die to yourself. You got to die daily. And you got to say, "Lord, I need you to help me so that you can take this part away from me so that I can grow. So that I can grow. I can grow closer to you." Because maybe this right here is a stumbling block, is a hindrance from me growing closer to you. So if it's something that's going to hinder me from growing closer to you, Lord, take it away from me. &gt;&gt; Because I want to be so close to you that I'm just like you. When people see me, they see you. When people hear me, they hear you. when they hear my conversation, they realize that there's something different about my conversation. &gt;&gt; There has to be a difference between you and the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God and the devil are not the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're the total opposites of each other. So if there's no difference between you and the world, then I ask you to examine yourself. &gt;&gt; If people are comfortable around you, I ask you to examine yourself because sometimes even though you you may be with them, you're not like them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes they don't feel absolutely comfortable having every conversation, doing everything when they're around you, when when that presence is there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it it'll cause people to not drink around you. It'll cause people to not smoke around you. It'll cause people to change their their vernacular, their language when they're around you just because that he's there with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, I I started to think about it and understand that there there's a separation that sometime God has you to go through and you have to understand that Lord, when I come to this place, I got to let your will be done. &gt;&gt; And sometimes that's a hard thing to do because you're holding on to this or you're holding on to that or you're holding on to this person or this person is fulfilling this. But when God does a thing, he doesn't take away a thing without giving you better. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; He doesn't take away a thing without showing you that I have another way that I want you to go. &gt;&gt; But but if you continue down the road that you holding on to this, you'll never understand where I'm trying to take you. You will never understand what I'm trying to do. I want to take you to a higher level that I can have more confidence in you than I have right now. I want to take you to a higher level that I can trust you with more than I trust you with right now. I want to take you higher so that I can allow you to to to have more a closer walk with me so that I can give you more than what I'm giving you right now. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we haven't had our prayers answered because we're not willing to give up things. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; We're not willing to let some things go in order for our prayers to be answered. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to say, "Lord, I I I asked you for this, but and Lord, I'm willing to let this go in order to gain what you have for me." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And and sometimes it comes in stages, but sometimes the Lord just comes out and plainly tell you, "No, give this up." &gt;&gt; And and the longer that you hold on to it, I told someone, I said, "Sometimes we we hold on to things and we block God blessings that God want to give us &gt;&gt; because we're holding on to it." &gt;&gt; Even though we know that it's not something, it may not even be something bad. It's just something that God wants us to have to have the the mindset that Lord, I'm not willing to hold on to anything to block you from giving what you want to give to me. I was talking to one of my friends recently and and they was and they they said they was praying they was asking the Lord, Lord, what would you want me to do? But in their prayer, they was asking the Lord, Lord, what would you want me to do? But Lord, I I don't want to do this, this, this, and this. And I said, "Man, you defeating the effect of your prayer." Cuz when you go to God, you can't say, "Lord, Lord, whatever you want me to do, I'll do it." And then say, "Lord, but I won't do this, this, this, and this." God may not even call you to do those things that's on your list. But he want you to have the willing heart to say, "Lord, whatever you want me to do, I'll do it." &gt;&gt; So, you can't block God and say, "Lord, whatever you have me to do, Lord, I want to give you my life, but I want to keep this, this, this, and this." because that isn't how God wants you to do it. He wants you to give up everything. He wants you to come to him and say, "Lord, I want I I give up everything so that God can have confidence that you'll be able to stand." When you give it up, he's going to give you strong something stronger inside of you to withstand all the temptation, to withstand all the fiery darts of the wicked. He's going to give that to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you got to be willing to give it all up. Hey, &gt;&gt; and I thought about it and and I had some other examples and and I thought about Peter and I thought about I said, "Can God have confidence in Peter?" God has such great confidence in Peter. He gave him the keys to the kingdom before he denied him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; He gave him the keys to the kingdom before Peter went went there and denied him three times that he didn't know the man. &gt;&gt; Bless. Bless &gt;&gt; said, "Sometimes, sometimes God has such confidence because sometimes he knows what's in your heart. He knew you before the beginning of time. He knew where you was." And I thought about it and it became powerful to me. I said, "Lord, why did you choose me out of all these people like why did you choose me? You knew all the mistakes I would make. You knew all the things that I would do, but you still had grace and mercy and decided to choose me." And I started thinking about it and it caused tears to come to my eyes because I realized it was nothing that I did. It was nothing that I could do. It was nothing I could say, anything that I could understand. It was all because God chose me &gt;&gt; and said sometimes you don't like the way the thing that he may call you to do because you say, "Well, that's not me or that's not what I want to do." But it's got to be greater than you. &gt;&gt; You got to realize that your purpose is greater than what you want to do. It's greater than what you think you want to do. It's greater than what you dreamed you want to do. It's greater than all of that. &gt;&gt; And sometimes when you're not in the place that God has put you, you'll always be trying and always be suffering and always be like Paul. It's hard to kick against the brick &gt;&gt; because God has something that he wants you to do. He wants to take you and elevate you to a point that he said, "I can have confidence in you. I can I can have confidence that you're going to be able to stand when the trials and tests come. I can have confidence that you're going to be able to overcome when I allow the devil that's going to come. If you are anything like Job, he going to come against you, too. If you are someone that's trying to live right, the devil is going to come to God and say, "Lord, can I test him, too? Lord, you he said that he love you. So, can I test him and see and see and see and see what's going to try him and said there was one time in the Bible the Lord said there was many spirits that came up. I remember the story parts of the story, but you can read it and look it up. But he said the the thing that was going to deceive them was a lion spirit. He allowed a lion spirit to come. And I and I think about it sometimes. Sometimes the thing that you that you think may be your stumbling block may not even be the thing. So many of people they go they go and they have all these guards up and they have all these things up but at somewhere there's a little gate that's still unlocked and that little gate is where the devil slip in and sometimes you got to find you got to go out and search you got to search your perimeter and search your surroundings and figure out where did you let down those bars said sometimes sometimes you you'll find yourself in a place and say man I ain't struggled with that in a long time and I started thinking about it I said, "You know, when something like that happens, that's when you have to examine yourself and say, "Where did I open the gate?" &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It might have been something simple. It might have been the person. It might have been a thing. But somewhere I open this gate and the devil came in here. And I got to go find First of I got to kick him out. Then I got to go search and make sure that I closed that gate that the devil came through. And I got to make sure that it's fortified and that I'm fortified in that area because the prophet of God said if he attacked you once that he's he can come back and attack you again. &gt;&gt; So many a time you have to stay and make sure that you stay covered under the blood &gt;&gt; and that you are dying daily to them and say Lord I still want you to continue to walk with me. Lord I still want you to continue to lead me. I still want you to continue to guide me. Lord I wake up early in the morning and Lord I want to start my day with you. I want to end my day with you and I want you there all from the beginning of the day to the end of the day because it's nothing like having the presence of God with you &gt;&gt; where you can feel them with you in your room in on your job when you can feel them in your car where you realize the angels of God are riding with you. &gt;&gt; I said I started to think about it and and I said what what is the level of confidence that God has in me? Can Can God trust me to to to stand when the devil comes or or am I always running back and and always falling short or or will there be a time that you overcome and you can stand on Lord you gave me power to overcome and I can stand on Lord when the devil comes again Lord you gave me power to overcome so if you did it once you can do it again cuz you're the same God yesterday and forever so if you did it once and then you can do it again. And that's how your relationship with God grows. That's how your relationship with God, it allows you to grow and you to stand firm and you to gain gain trust with God because you realize that God, he he's dealing in my life. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's working with me individually each and every day. He's talking to me. He's showing me. He's allowing me to see the things that I He He's not only using the pastor, but he's also working in my life. He's also allowing me to see that even though some things to some may be small but it may be great to me &gt;&gt; and and and I started to see it and I started to realize that when God is doing the thing sometimes he just started just like Elijah's servant when he opened his eyes he saw and God is working each and every day in all of our lives but you may not notice it and sometimes you got to be still and know that he is God. You got to stand still and say, "Lord, I want you to show me that I'm cognizant. I'm I'm I'm aware that you're working in my life. That I'm aware that Lord, you're speaking through this one. You're using this one. Lord, you're using that one. You're moving here and you're moving there." And I realized why I didn't go down this road because there was an accident. And I went this way today because I thought it was just me just taking a different route, but it was you allowed me to get to work on time. See, when God starts doing things that you start to understand it's not by power, it's not by might, but it's by his spirit that he allows us to go through things and he covers us. Then you'll realize that Lord, I have such confidence in you that I can stand like Job. &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; said, don't ever let someone take the take the take your relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever level it is, don't ever let no anyone talk you out of your relationship with God. Don't ever talk let someone talk you out of the testimony and the things that God has done for you when you realize how good God is and the things that he does. You you can stand on those things. You can stand no matter how small or how great they are cuz to you those are things that that allow you to build your faith that allow you to stand on it and they become a testimony of what God can do. &gt;&gt; They become a testimony of how good God is. They become a testimony that God is doing exactly what his word said he would do. He's a he's because there has to be a people that stand on and show that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. There has to be someone that'll stand up and say, "I'll testify that God is the same yesterday and forever." So if he said, "I'm a healer," there has to be someone that has been healed, that can testify that God is a healer. If there's someone, if he says, "I'm a savior," there has to be someone that'll testify that God has saved them. If he said, "I fill you with the Holy Ghost," there has to be someone that has the Holy Ghost that can be a proof to show that, "Hey, he's living inside of me. Hey, he talks to me. He walks with me and he goes along with me all the way." And see, and when you realize that I'm that testimony, then you start to walk with a different authority, with a different confidence, because you realize that God is with you. You realize he's standing right there beside you and that he'll never leave you and never forsake you and that he'll be there till the end. &gt;&gt; See, he had that fellowship with God is such so strong with God that God had complete confidence that Job was going to overcome this test. because no matter how long the test was, no matter how long it took for him to overcome, he knew that his faith was not going to waver in God. And said that's what God is trying to elevate us to the point that no matter what comes, no matter what happens, no matter what may stand in our way, there's nothing that's going to take us out of the will of God. &gt;&gt; As long as we believe and we trust him with everything, we have no doubt in him. God is going to prevail all the time. He's going to always overcome. He's always going to allow us to get the victory. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; See, that's the that's when you realize that Lord, I I'm I'm surrendering in such a way that Lord, I you can have confidence in me cuz I realize how real you are. I realize how real of a God you are and that you and that I will trust you no matter what. I trust you in the good and the bad, in the up and the down. I realize that it's only a temporary situation. It's only a temporary moment. No matter how bad it got, Job said, even though he realized, he said, he said, "Naked I came into this world and naked I shall return. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." See, Job got to that point. No matter what happens, &gt;&gt; I trust you. &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, I believe I never doubt that you aren't God, that you aren't real, and that you won't do what you said you will do. See, one time eventually the devil lifted off of him and God blessed him with double than what he had before. &gt;&gt; See, that was just a testimony of what God could do. When you get so close to God, you get such a relationship with God. You get such a fellowship with God that you that you talk to him and he talks to you and you commune with him and he communes with you. You'll be just like Adam was in the Garden of Eden when Jesus would come down and he would dwell there and call his name and Adam would go talk to God. And and you see how Adam was, he had authority to name everything, all the animals, all the the plants, the fruit, everything. Cuz God had given him that authority. And he said that he would give us the same thing. But we have to get to that point that Lord, we trust you above all else. &gt;&gt; We trust you above family. We trust you above friends. We trust you above all this thing because we have such a relationship with you that we can trust you no matter what. That Lord, we want you to have complete confidence in us because we have complete confidence in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We know that all things work together to the good &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord, to them who have the call according to his purpose. And God has a purpose for each and every one of our lives. Amen. And we want God's will to be done, his purpose to be done in our lives. So it says, "Work out your soul's salvation with fear and trembling." So by the grace of God, Amen. Joe was able to stand when all some people say when all hell broke out against him, Joe still stood. When it he said the gates of hell shall not prevail against you. Amen. So God knows that your revelation in him, praise God, that nothing can shake your faith in God. Lord, I'll stand for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Stand fast in the liberty where Christ has made you free and be not again entangled with the yoke of bondage." Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very important that the stand that we take, it must be firm. &gt;&gt; If you stand for him, &gt;&gt; he'll stand for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God's going to stand for you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When it comes to crossing that river, Amen. God will stand there. Amen. He'll welcome you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on in, good and faithful servant. &gt;&gt; Enter into the joy of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good, Amen. that God recognize your faithfulness. &gt;&gt; If you're faithful to him, he'll he's faithful. &gt;&gt; And he will not forget your labor of love &gt;&gt; that you shown towards his name. He'll never forget. Amen. You. Praise God. That's why often times he said when I think about the goodness of Jesus and all that he's done for me my soul cries out hallelujah and I thank God for saving me. &gt;&gt; Once you begin to praise God for all his benefits towards &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; then your head will not be down but your head will be lifted up. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, uh, I'll lift my head up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because in the time of trouble, Amen. &gt;&gt; He shall hide me in his prevail. &gt;&gt; In the secrets of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock, &gt;&gt; and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I know we serve a God that can lift us up. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll make it all right. &gt;&gt; He'll work it out for you. &gt;&gt; He'll fix it for you. &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows how to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You don't have to trust in your own ability. You can trust in the word of God. &gt;&gt; The word of God is quick. It's powerful. It's sharp. Amen. It's gone out of his mouth and it shall Amen. accomplished that when he sent it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you put the word in your mouth &gt;&gt; and you speak the word in faith &gt;&gt; and you set it out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It it will not come back, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because it's God's word. &gt;&gt; And God said, you said, Lord, I'm saying what you said. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you said you would do it. &gt;&gt; So Lord, you promise to do it. You promise, Lord, &gt;&gt; and I can hold fast &gt;&gt; because God promises will not fail. &gt;&gt; It will not fall to the ground. &gt;&gt; It will come. &gt;&gt; He'll do what he said. &gt;&gt; There is no doubt, &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; If he did it before, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Jesus, &gt;&gt; he's obligated to do it &gt;&gt; again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God does not change his mind about his word. What he did then, he continued to do all the way. It's not a better way. Amen. God only has one way. Praise God. Hallelujah. So, God bless you tonight. Appreciate the word tonight. Appreciate you coming tonight. Amen. keep on fighting the good fight of faith that we might lay hold on eternal life was super short by the grace of God we thank us just stand tonight I'm not going to prolong the time maybe this is one of those times where we are short but I hope that we something was said to Amen let you know it's worth your effort to make it praise God spoke a word that don't take a whole a lot for God to speak and you know he spoke to your need and he met amen the need in your life. Praise God. So Lord sometimes we say Lord if you just say one thing amen let me understand and know Amen that you're speaking to me. You spoke to me and you met my need. As our heads are bowed, hearts are looking him. Father, in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you, oh God, that can he have confidence? &gt;&gt; Can God trust us? The question was asked. He had confidence in Job enough to let the devil try him in such such a way. Glory. &gt;&gt; Can God trust us? Can he have confidence? &gt;&gt; Now how many want to say Lord Hallelujah [Music] Lord you can have confidence in me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, because I trust you tonight, &gt;&gt; Lord, in all my failures and all my mistakes, you know, &gt;&gt; Lord, I got confidence in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; May you help me, oh God. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord, in the midst of all my failures. Help me tonight &gt;&gt; to stand firm like Job. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Help me to be a real soldier. &gt;&gt; Oh God, to fully surrender to your will. &gt;&gt; God, do Lord, do Lord, fill me with your spirit. Give me the strength and the power and the ability. Amen. That Job stood I can stand. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I want to stand for you. How many want to stand for him? God, I want to be I want to be able no matter what come or what goes. I want to be willing to Lord to say yes to your will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Help me to stand tonight in the midst of all. I love you. I appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you, Father. May you bless everyone. these that are here tonight, those that are listening in, Lord God, that they can take a firm stand on your word. And Lord God, we're living in a treacherous time and a dark hour. Living in a time, oh God, that oh God, look like everything is falling apart. But God, we looking to you now. We're trusting in your ability, &gt;&gt; God, to keep us, oh God, &gt;&gt; in this evil age, &gt;&gt; oh God, protect your children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, you had angels encamped around about Joy. Let your angels encamp around about your children, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need the angels of God. We need you, Lord, &gt;&gt; to do those things. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you're not saved tonight, have you surrendered your heart to the Lord? Why don't you tell Jesus, "Jesus, I want you to come into my life and I want to live for you. I want to be able to take a stand in the school, on the job, and the community, Lord, in the family. I want to take a stand for you. Lord, forgive me, Lord. Give me. Come into my life, Lord. I want to live for you in Jesus name. Thank you, Lord. Thank him. Thank him. Thank him. Amen. Amen. The Bible says, "Y'all going, huh? Y'all in a hurry. Thank you, Jesus." I want to say the Bible said, "Repent, be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin. You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Remember Peter used the keys on the day of Pentecost. If he used them then same keys are being used now. If you haven't done that, you need to do it in Jesus Christ's name. God bless you. Thank you.
