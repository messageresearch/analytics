[28:11] of

[28:22] Genesis Genesis the 22nd chapter
[28:31] and we begin at the first verse you got
[28:33] to say amen amen amen praise the Lord
[28:36] and it came to pass after these things
[28:38] that God did tempt Abram and said unto
[28:41] them Abraham and he say behold here I am
[28:44] now that word tempt there God Don't
[28:46] Tempt no man the Bible say God tempted
[28:48] no man but a man is tempted when Liv
[28:50] with his own lust and entice that word
[28:52] is their
[28:53] test God tested Abraham he's testing
[28:56] Abraham faith
[28:58] amen praise God and he said take now thy
[29:01] son thine only son Isaac whom thou
[29:05] lovest and get thee into the land of
[29:06] Moriah and offer him there for a burnt
[29:09] offering upon one of the MS which I will
[29:11] tell thee of now God is telling him to
[29:14] take now his only son in God's eye
[29:18] that's his only son uh Ishmael is not
[29:21] even in the
[29:22] picture come on somebody Ishmael is not
[29:25] even in the picture and God's eye
[29:28] Abraham only had one son and that son is
[29:31] Isaac cuz he is the Son Of Promise amen
[29:35] praise God and Abraham rose up early in
[29:37] the morning and saddled his ass and took
[29:39] two of his young men with him and Isaac
[29:41] his son and cleaved the wood for the
[29:43] burnt offering and Rose up and went unto
[29:46] the place of which God had told him then
[29:49] the third day Abraham looked up his eyes
[29:52] and saw the place a far off and Abraham
[29:55] said unto the young man abide ye here
[29:57] with the ass
[29:58] and I in the lab will go Yonder and
[30:00] worship and come again to you look at
[30:02] his
[30:03] faith he believes that he's coming back
[30:06] not only by himself but Isaac is coming
[30:08] back with him amen praise God that would
[30:10] take Faith to believe God and they man
[30:13] took the wood of the burnt offering and
[30:14] laid it upon Isaac his son and he took
[30:17] the fire in his hand and a knife and
[30:19] they went both of them together and
[30:21] Isaac spake unto his father unto Abraham
[30:24] his father and said my father and he
[30:26] said here I my son he said behold the
[30:29] fire and the wood but where is the Lamb
[30:32] for a burnt offering notice this eth
[30:34] verse this what we coming from and
[30:37] Abraham said my son God will provide
[30:41] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[30:44] they went both of them together let us
[30:46] pray gracious kind Heavenly Father we
[30:48] have read your word now I ask you to
[30:50] bless it in Jesus Christ's name amen you
[30:52] may be
[30:55] seated we going to take a topic from
[30:58] there by the grace of God eternal life
[31:01] making the
[31:03] sacrifice here is a
[31:06] prophecy Abraham being a prophet himself
[31:09] he said Isaac running with a lamb at he
[31:11] don't know he was supposed to be the
[31:13] sacrifice he didn't know he was going to
[31:15] be the sacrifice so when he get to the
[31:18] place that God told him to go he asks
[31:20] his father where is the Lamb for the
[31:23] sacrifice Abraham said my son God will
[31:27] provide provide himself a lamb for a
[31:30] burnt offering amen so God said the
[31:33] prophecy is God won't provide himself a
[31:37] lamb for a burnt offering and that what
[31:40] God did God came down to be a sacrifice
[31:45] to bring eternal life back to man amen
[31:49] see in order to get eternal life it
[31:51] takes a sacrifice God sacrificed
[31:54] everything that he was everything he is
[31:56] in order to bring eternal life life to
[31:58] me and you he made ultimate
[32:02] sacrifice sacrifice everything to he was
[32:05] in order to bring eternal life back to
[32:08] me and you now eternal life is not
[32:10] something new we had eternal life where
[32:13] man did inside the Garden of Eden but
[32:16] sin caused man to lose eternal life
[32:19] let's go to Genesis 3 so sin will cause
[32:22] you to use lose eternal life amen God
[32:25] man lost eternal life in the Garden of
[32:28] Eden when he disobeyed God's word when
[32:30] God told him not to eat off the tree
[32:33] amen he listened to his wife and he took
[32:35] up the tree and he brought sin and
[32:38] condemnation into the world Amen praise
[32:40] God Genesis 3 and22 amen praise the Lord
[32:44] so eternal life God is going to bring it
[32:48] back how you going to bring it back it
[32:49] takes a
[32:51] sacrifice in order to get back eternal
[32:53] life it takes a
[32:55] sacrifice God now had to give up
[32:57] everything that he is in order to come
[33:00] down and to redeem man back to himself
[33:04] praise God let's go to Genesis 3 amen
[33:06] praise the Lord
[33:10] amen my question tonight is this do you
[33:14] want eternal
[33:17] life amen Genesis 3
[33:22] and22 and the Lord God said behold the
[33:26] man has become as one us to know good
[33:28] and evil and now let he put forth his
[33:31] hand and take all of the tree of life
[33:34] and eat and live forever see he had the
[33:38] opportunity right there man God didn't
[33:40] put him out the garden then he could
[33:41] have eat off the tree and he would have
[33:43] live forever he was created to live
[33:45] forever but when sin came in then he
[33:48] could have eat off the tree and live
[33:50] forever see he was created to live
[33:54] forever he was eternal just like God was
[33:57] go he was the Son of God see he could
[34:00] live forever but when sin came in then
[34:03] God had pushed him out of the garden and
[34:05] now God said let's put him out let he
[34:08] take off the tree and eat and live
[34:10] forever see he got eat off the tree so
[34:13] eternal life is not something new it's
[34:17] something that man had from the
[34:19] beginning but was lost now it takes a
[34:22] sacrifice to bring it back amen God
[34:26] willing to risk everything for for me
[34:28] and you he he risk everything came down
[34:31] himself and just took on the Flesh of
[34:33] man in order to bring eternal life to
[34:35] you amen see he sacrificed it all now he
[34:39] he he wasn't concerned about the the the
[34:42] the what what it going to take he was
[34:44] willing to give it all up for me and he
[34:46] did he gave it all up for me and you
[34:48] amen why cuz he want us to have what
[34:50] eternal life amen now a lot of people
[34:53] want eternal life but they're not
[34:55] willing to make the sacrifice in order
[34:58] to get
[34:59] it see God made the sacrifice to bring
[35:02] you eternal life now you willing to make
[35:04] the sacrifice to get eternal life see a
[35:08] lot of people they don't want to
[35:10] sacrifice nothing they want eternal life
[35:13] but they willing to make the sacrifice a
[35:15] lot of people ain't willing to make the
[35:17] sacrifice amen see so eternal life how
[35:21] do you get it amen praise God you got to
[35:23] get it through the word of Goden it been
[35:26] a mystery for ye for ages and for years
[35:29] man didn't understand death he didn't
[35:31] understand about eternal life but it was
[35:34] lost it was lost to man eternal life
[35:39] David say uh job says a man died will he
[35:42] live again see so man lost that
[35:45] revelation of eternal life but Jesus
[35:47] came by God's sacrifice to bring it back
[35:51] let's go to the book of uh Timothy 2
[35:54] Timothy
[35:55] 1:8 praise the Lord so eternal life
[35:59] everybody wants it but requires a
[36:01] sacrifice God know it required a
[36:03] sacrifice that why he came and
[36:04] sacrificed himself cuz he know in order
[36:07] to bring him back something had to die
[36:09] in order to take the place of what
[36:11] happened in order to bring eternal life
[36:13] back he knew he had to come down himself
[36:15] in order to to bring it
[36:17] back a angel couldn't do it because
[36:20] there was a man that lost it for man got
[36:23] to bring it back it couldn't bring an
[36:26] angel it couldn't bring no supernatural

[45:20] sacrifice y'all bear with me in Jesus
[45:22] Christ's name amen praise the
[45:25] Lord uh
[45:30] the word sacrifice has multiple meanings
[45:33] including giving up something for a
[45:34] greater good or offering something to a
[45:37] dity in this sense we talking about
[45:39] giving up something for a greater good
[45:43] that what God did he sacrificed himself
[45:46] for a greater good that mean to bring
[45:47] eternal life back to his children amen
[45:51] see a great a
[45:53] good sacrificed himself in order to

[46:00] something you're looking at doing it for
[46:01] what a greater good amen do you know
[46:04] what a greater good is serving
