recliner they don't have to and they got a bank account they don't even have to witness no more that why the church EMP the morning the young people don't know nothing about witness too much maybe

up here judge Jenkin some of con some of Big Time preacher tell them all prayer cuz you ain't got to ask they know that I'm changed they have heard that I gave my life to God yes Amen Let Me Tell You

I don't want you to go too hard I know you've been going through a little but I thank God for him amen prayer changed things we got to pray more telling the Sunday school this morning about your testimony I said what's the number one thing in winning souls and I asked the question how many Souls have you w to the Lord how can you look back and said I've won how many Souls you I I wouldn't even try to count the number myself but if each and every one of us would be interesed in winning souls to Jesus Christ and I said how do you know how to win a soul what do you think the number one thing and winning souls to Christ and every everybody had number one right and um they were right on it so life you live and then uh sister Chapel she was telling in a roundabout way and all through about number two and she said people will look at your life then she told number two and telling number two I said sister you got it all right but I want it in one word how do you witness how do you win a soul and she told us how exactly the answer I said I'm going in one word and I think brother G answered it you see that's the one word he said your testimony if you ever been saved you got a what got a testimony now if you ain't saved you ain't got nothing to say to nobody you ain't even G to witness to nobody because you ain't saved yourself and if you ain't certain about your salvation you ain't telling nobody else to come on serve the Lord like me now if you trying to get somebody to church then that's another thing see I think we're more interested in getting somebody to come to church than we're interested in somebody coming to Christ because if you get them to Christ they don't have to come to this church but they have to come to the Lord are you with me see you got to you know because you can get somebody here they don't belong here you know they might be more suited to be somewhere else but if you get them to Christ Christ will lead them where to go are you with me so by the grace of God uh it's very important the Bible said after the Holy Ghost come upon you you should be the first thing you're going to be is a witness I had a young couple talk about getting married I said my married counselor number one married counselor if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you don't need to get married because I doubt your marriage going to work that's number one that's the first thing I ain't got to counsel you on that get on your knees and get a breakthrough get the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost you ain't gonna be able to put up with one another have trouble putting up with one another two lives trying to come together you need the Holy Ghost love will last a couple years but ain't GNA last long because that's only feeling your love you know what I'm saying but when you got got God together amen and you put him first when things get out of whack you still got to guard your ankor are you with me I'm marriage counseling now amen some of us miss it but let me give you a little bit of it now that's what we need we don't need to get married we need the Holy Ghost we get the Holy Ghost we can get married are you with me if if one get it and the other don't get it hold off brother I can't be unequally Yol together you got to yoke up you got to get God I remember my sister those you know I got married old man my sister those is getting married you got to get the Holy Ghost you get in that tire room if you don't get it you better fake it can't get married till you get it you can't get married till you get the Holy Ghost the nice young man you can be nice as you want but you ain't going to get this sister till you get the Holy Ghost you likewise should be amen the brother need the Holy Ghost the sister need the Holy Ghost you want to marry she got to get the Holy Ghost are you with me they don't get the Holy Ghost let them goone go cuz you going to have a lot of trouble you going to have a lot of trouble are you with me if you don't you going to have you goingon to be you going oh Lord I'm prayer change St you going to pray till something change are you with me a marriage without the Holy Ghost is to you go through a lot of unnecessary troubles unnecessary problems but with the Holy Ghost amen you're going to you'll be able to face the challenges and the things you have have to go through because you got the love of God in your heart and you know how to love one another I can teach you all I want mama can teach you brother can teach you sister but with the Holy Ghost amen you know what real love is all about you God has given you his kind of love so you know how to treat one another are you with me marriage counseling you know how to treat one another are you with me because where that other kind of love it ain't going to teach you to how to treat one another are you with me you ain't got to be peeping over your shoulder I don't know where you at and I don't know where she at you say you're going shopping to the store that was yesterday you just made it back you where you been I been shopping like I told you okay but with the Holy Ghost amen you ain't looking over your shoulder you ain't worried about it praise God you a worri about somebody stopping by the house you don't worri about none of that stuff you Ain worri about that you trust him amen Holy Ghost filled amen somebody that got God in their life other than that you can't trust him what you can't trust her you can't TR it's a lot of uncertainty lot oh you can trust I ain't worried about nothing I got to you a't stronger than no devil are
