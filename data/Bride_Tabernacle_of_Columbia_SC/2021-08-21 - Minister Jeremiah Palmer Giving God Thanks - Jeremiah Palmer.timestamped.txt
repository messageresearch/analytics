[34:47] amen but i thank god for anyhow amen
[34:51] luke 17
[34:54] and 11
[34:58] and then psalm 75 and 1.
[35:02] 1711
[35:04] through 19
[35:07] and it came to pass
[35:10] as he went to jerusalem that he passed
[35:13] through the midst of samaria
[35:16] and galilee
[35:18] and as he entered into a certain village
[35:20] there met him
[35:22] ten men
[35:24] that were lepers
[35:26] which stood a fall off
[35:29] and they lifted up their voices and said
[35:31] jesus
[35:32] master
[35:34] have mercy on us
[35:36] and when he saw them
[35:38] he said unto them
[35:40] go show yourself unto the priests and it
[35:44] came to pass
[35:46] that as they went
[35:48] they were cleansed
[35:50] and one of them when he saw that he was
[35:52] healed
[35:54] turned back
[35:56] and with a loud voice glorified god
[36:00] and fell down on his face
[36:03] at his feet giving him thanks
[36:05] and he was a samaritan
[36:09] and jesus answering said where dare not
[36:13] ten cleanse
[36:15] but where are the nine
[36:18] there are not found
[36:20] that return to give glory to god
[36:23] save this stranger and he said unto him
[36:27] arise go thy way
[36:29] thy faith had made thee whole i want you
[36:33] to hold your hands there
[36:34] go meet your book of psalms
[36:38] boys feeling like you want to
[36:42] go out
[36:45] psalm 75 just one
[36:49] verse one seven to five and one
[36:53] unto thee oh god
[36:55] do we give thanks
[36:57] unto thee do we give thanks
[37:00] for that thy name is near thy wondrous
[37:03] works declared let us pray
[37:06] father god we thank you tonight for your
[37:09] mercy and for your grace
[37:11] we pray god that you bless the word in
[37:13] jesus name amen may be seated
[37:21] want to
[37:23] just for a few minutes tonight
[37:28] and not even really to preach tonight
[37:30] but just to
[37:32] try to
[37:32] [Music]
[37:35] speak a little on
[37:36] giving god thanks
[37:41] i know it seems to be
[37:45] very
[37:46] simple
[37:48] even talking about it but
[37:52] i was thinking one morning that i got up
[37:57] and it just kind of struck me you know
[38:03] that god is good
[38:08] and the words don't really even
[38:11] express
[38:14] my gratitude
[38:17] for what god has done
[38:22] and what he is doing
[38:24] and what he is going to do
[38:30] you may even look at yourself and think
[38:35] that you don't have nothing
[38:38] to give thanks for but you do
[38:44] if god would even open up our eyes and
[38:46] let us see the things that he has
[38:49] delivered us and protected us from
[38:54] i believe we'll be more appreciated
[38:59] but the things that he has given us in
[39:03] allowing us
[39:04] to be able to do
[39:07] i like that song that uh discusses those
[39:10] things and said that
[39:12] uh you know when i think about the
[39:14] goodness of god and what all he done it
[39:16] makes you want to shout
[39:20] when you and i just think about
[39:23] our own lives and
[39:26] where god brought us from
[39:31] somebody said brother ernie said he
[39:33] brought you from a mighty long way
[39:38] you may look at your mistakes and you
[39:41] may look at
[39:42] uh what you are not but thank god for
[39:45] what you are
[39:50] somebody said that
[39:52] be patient with me because god isn't
[39:54] through with me here
[39:59] i'm just thinking
[40:01] a little
[40:03] report
[40:05] there in marion we the lord blessed that
[40:09] you know we had three people sinners
[40:11] that gave their life to the lord
[40:15] and looking at me having water baptism
[40:16] with them
[40:19] you know and i say you know lord thank
[40:21] you
[40:23] because it showed that god is still in
[40:26] the saving business
[40:29] i know it's very real that
[40:31] we see sinners
[40:34] you know repent and come to the lord but
[40:37] you know it's still sure that there are
[40:39] some people that want god amen
[40:45] and i just said lord you know it's
[40:48] nothing uh no credit nobody can get
[40:51] because that's god's grace
[40:58] so we are working with them and
[41:02] don't have no religious background
[41:04] basically
[41:06] you know i said and that's the best kind
[41:11] because it's harder to deal with
[41:12] religious folks
[41:17] but we see that here in luke
[41:24] jesus had went
[41:26] by a place samaria and
[41:31] there were 10 lepers you know leopard
[41:33] was supposed to be an incurable
[41:37] disease
[41:40] and jesus saw these ten lepers standing
[41:44] afar off
[41:48] you know in those days that the
[41:50] jews and samaritan had no dealing with a
[41:53] samaritan a half jew and a gentile
[41:59] so they really didn't had much dealing
[42:01] with them
[42:04] maybe i can see them that their case
[42:08] was hopeless
[42:11] so they kind of distant themselves
[42:16] maybe because of a acquisition or some
[42:19] kind of reproach that maybe somebody
[42:22] would have said
[42:26] but jesus saw him there
[42:31] and when jesus saw him
[42:36] you know i i thank god that he doesn't
[42:40] look at us in that way
[42:44] he doesn't look at how bad your
[42:47] situation is
[42:49] he doesn't look at how hopeless
[42:52] it may be to you or
[42:55] maybe even to the doctors maybe that
[42:58] can't do anything for you
[43:00] god can help you
[43:04] and when he looked at him he
[43:07] lost he lifted up his voice
[43:14] they begin to say jesus
[43:18] master
[43:21] have mercy
[43:23] on us
[43:27] you know that
[43:30] if you had a situation that
[43:33] was helped listen
[43:35] you may have heard about jesus and
[43:38] you got in uh a place that where you
[43:41] could call him
[43:43] perhaps maybe that he can do something
[43:47] for your situation
[43:54] i don't know about you but i realized
[43:56] that i need jesus
[44:01] lord have mercy on us
[44:06] how are we going to make it
[44:09] if god don't make a way
[44:12] how are we going to be able to stand
[44:15] what's coming upon his earth if it
[44:18] wasn't for the mercy and the grace of
[44:20] god
[44:24] no we don't even deserve and we don't
[44:27] know how
[44:29] we don't know when but jesus have mercy
[44:36] that's what we want tonight
[44:40] have mercy on my
[44:43] faults
[44:45] on my short coming lord
[44:48] i i don't want you to judge me god but i
[44:52] want your mercy
[44:56] thank god he's merciful
[45:00] thank god he's long
[45:02] suffering thank god he see beyond our
[45:07] faults and he see our need
[45:16] nothing we can boast about
[45:20] is god
[45:22] mercy on us
[45:25] how you made it as far as god mercy
[45:32] how you are still here
[45:35] in this hour at this time in this day
[45:40] it was only god mercy
[45:47] i you could have been like everybody
[45:50] else
[45:53] the bible say men hearts are failing
[45:57] for fear
[46:00] because of what's coming upon the face
[46:02] of the earth
[46:05] the other day in haiti i heard about
[46:07] haiti had an
[46:08] another earthquake
[46:11] california's on fire again
[46:15] seemingly it stays on fire
[46:20] people
[46:22] lives at jeopardy
[46:27] our lives are at jeopardy
[46:31] and the only way we're going to make it
[46:33] is god's grace
[46:37] be the bible say if the righteous
[46:39] scarcely
[46:42] lord have mercy
[46:45] be saved
[46:49] how is it
[46:50] god mercy on us
[46:56] they saw him
[46:59] you know it's something that when you
[47:01] get in the presence of god
[47:04] you realize you need his mercy
[47:11] we are facing things
[47:15] in our lives and all around us in our
[47:18] homes that job at work you know
[47:22] everywhere we go things that we don't
[47:25] even know what we're dealing with
[47:31] but we're trusting in the mercy of god
[47:38] jesus heard these leper
[47:42] 10 reminders 10.
[47:46] heard that cry
[47:50] you know god always healed contrite in a
[47:53] broken spirit
[47:58] when people began to cry out
[48:02] god began to move
[48:10] here
[48:12] as jesus heard they cry
[48:19] he began to tell them
[48:22] when he saw them he said to them go and
[48:25] show yourself to the priests
[48:30] in the old testament the priests are the
[48:33] one that's supposed to announce that a
[48:35] leper has been cleansed
[48:38] there was a proper way that it had to be
[48:40] done
[48:43] but jesus being a high priest
[48:50] and he could have been touched by the
[48:52] feeling of the infirmity
[48:56] and i want to say tonight he can be
[48:58] touched by your infirmity
[49:02] whatever it is that you may be going
[49:05] through god can be touched by it
[49:12] and as it went
[49:16] they were cleansed
[49:21] but one of them
[49:25] when he saw that
[49:28] he was healed
[49:31] he turned back
[49:37] maybe our paraphrase he said
[49:41] maybe he didn't really
[49:42] recognize what had happened to him
[49:46] but something struck him
[49:49] i got to go back and give god thanks
[49:56] sometime in our minds we
[49:58] we have to understand uh that we maybe
[50:02] didn't give god the proper things
[50:07] as the songs say because he deserves
[50:10] that
[50:13] he's better than just good
[50:17] i don't believe good is even a word that
[50:19] you can express
[50:21] how much and how well god can take care
[50:24] of us even when you don't even think you
[50:28] deserve it god still does it
[50:36] oh yes sir
[50:39] i know sometimes we even give up on our
[50:42] own self

[53:23] many of us could have been dead
[53:26] this week god might have spared you
[53:30] maybe through a tragedy a wreck
[53:33] and god just gave you a little bit of
[53:35] grace
[53:38] you might have been facing some
[53:40] something else in your life and what the
[53:43] devil tried to trap you but god just
[53:46] stepped right in time
[53:50] ah i thought about i was just coming the
[53:52] other day
[53:53] down two knots you know and
[53:55] all of a sudden i looked in my mirror
[53:57] and i saw
[53:59] you know a car he was getting it
[54:02] there on two notch and i saw i began i
[54:04] said let me get over in this right lane
[54:07] and before i knew it
[54:09] that car then got right up on me
[54:13] and just so happened
[54:15] it was a bridge there
[54:18] just a little bit of space
[54:20] you know he came and i kind of saw him
[54:22] and i kind of was able to get back over
[54:25] and i said thank you jesus
[54:29] i said because you never know
[54:33] you know
[54:34] it's good uh to have god amen in your
[54:38] life
[54:41] when you can't even protect yourself god
[54:44] is your protector
[54:47] well we are wearing the masses and we
[54:50] are doing the shots and we're trying to
[54:52] take precaution that's good but god is
[54:56] your protector
[55:01] i'm ready to stop no servant of god oh
[55:03] my my mind
[55:05] servant of god say medicine
[55:08] does not heal you
[55:10] it only aids nature
[55:13] he said god is the healer
[55:20] and no matter what the devil is trying
[55:22] to do church
[55:24] oh god is your healer
[55:27] i'll be the bible say god heal
[55:30] all
[55:32] oh i like that
[55:35] he didn't just name you know
[55:37] sugar
[55:38] or high blood or
[55:41] uh cancer but he said oh
[55:46] everything you may even contact with
[55:50] everything that may even try to come
[55:52] upon you
[55:54] god got you back
[55:57] i read the bible said
[56:00] and when the enemy comes in like a flood
[56:04] he said the spirit of the lord
[56:07] will raise up a standard
[56:11] i'm closing let's go to one more
[56:13] scripture
[56:15] the book of first thessalonians
[56:19] oh my
[56:22] i wish
[56:25] that i know how to really
[56:30] enter into
[56:35] the praises of god
[56:40] sometimes you get a little beside
[56:42] yourself
[56:46] but i think sometimes we need to
[56:54] one
[56:56] lady sing this song she said
[57:00] if you understood my pain you understand
[57:03] my praise
[57:07] she was saying how she was homeless
[57:10] that she was left for dead
[57:13] but she said but god
[57:17] god
[57:18] lifted her she she was on welfare
[57:24] she was at her lowest point
[57:28] and everybody around her gave up
[57:31] except jesus
[57:35] i want to tell you people
[57:37] when it seemed like every thing and
[57:40] everybody else has given up on you god
[57:43] still cares
[57:49] telling the young man very marion he
[57:52] kind of a street guy
[57:55] and i was just sharing my testimony to
[57:57] how god delivered me from
[57:59] the drug scenes and stuff and
[58:04] i noticed his
[58:05] eyes just
[58:09] but i would let them see what god did
[58:11] for me he can do it for you too
[58:15] he's still god
[58:17] and he has not changed
[58:20] he still
[58:22] is a deliverer
[58:25] he is still a provider
[58:28] he is still a comforter
[58:31] he is still
[58:33] a drug out of peace
[58:37] he's still a provider
[58:39] it doesn't matter how long
[58:42] you may have been in your shape god is
[58:44] still a provider
[58:49] oh my
[58:52] he'll provide a way for you that you
[58:54] can't even imagine
[58:57] what you've been trying to work to do
[58:59] god will just give it to you
[59:05] because of your faithfulness to god
[59:08] and i can't help excuse me i had to keep
[59:10] saying this
[59:12] you know because it come back to me
[59:14] brother simmons
[59:15] you know like he told me that long years
[59:17] ago
[59:20] you know he told me don't put nothing
[59:24] before god
[59:27] and i know
[59:29] it may
[59:30] some of you can't know why you keep
[59:31] saying because god done something
[59:36] because i believe the word i believe
[59:38] that god had something in it it stuck
[59:42] with me and i tried to live by that
[59:46] yes i may have could have been over here
[59:48] and over there doing this and doing that
[59:51] but i stood still
[59:56] and i made up in my mind regardless of
[59:58] what i don't have what i have i'm still
[1:00:01] going to serve the lord
[1:00:04] i'm not going to count god slack
[1:00:08] because i say god is not slack
[1:00:10] concerning his promises
[1:00:13] don't cut god slack
[1:00:15] don't count god that he can't do he can
[1:00:19] do anything
[1:00:22] oh my
[1:00:25] he never failed me brother
[1:00:28] never failed me
[1:00:31] seven children
[1:00:34] all young and god made away
[1:00:40] seven
[1:00:42] now even my little baby now is 13.
[1:00:46] lord have mercy where did the time go
[1:00:50] but i saw what god could do
[1:00:55] i saw how he could provide
[1:01:00] for me
[1:01:01] when i couldn't even provide for myself
[1:01:04] everything's of god to prove himself to
[1:01:07] you
