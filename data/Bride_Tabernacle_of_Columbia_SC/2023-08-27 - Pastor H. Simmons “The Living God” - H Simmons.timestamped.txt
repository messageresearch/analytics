[34:00] fresh your way out this morning in Jesus
[34:03] Christ's name
[34:06] we
[34:07] want to thank God for
[34:09] a visit to Yolanda Lloyd and all other
[34:13] visitors we thank God for you coming and
[34:16] being with us in Jesus Christ's name
[34:19] God is good amen
[34:21] trusted you blessed while you're here
[34:24] and come back and visit us some more
[34:27] amen
[34:29] thank God
[34:39] all week comes seems to do obvious just
[34:43] stirred because
[34:46] I'm looking
[34:48] I don't know sometimes you to reevaluate
[34:51] your spiritual walk and your life
[34:54] and then
[34:56] I think Caleb spoke on Friday concerning
[34:59] prayer
[35:00] and I was wondering what is it going to
[35:02] take
[35:03] for the church
[35:06] to be in power and been on fire for God
[35:10] and all I could think about is you got a
[35:12] Primo
[35:13] you know we used to have those all-night
[35:17] Prouds and
[35:18] praying for hours and all and
[35:21] it seems like if we have proud service
[35:24] just a few people can make it
[35:27] and uh I think sometimes we need to
[35:30] unite ourselves in prayer
[35:32] you know I think he said call for the
[35:34] praying women of the church and and I
[35:37] believe that
[35:39] we started getting
[35:41] more in prayer
[35:44] we'll see God move
[35:46] so my heart is
[35:50] is that
[35:51] the people of God be on fire for God
[35:56] and
[35:57] the lack of fire for God is
[36:01] caused the world to creep in and things
[36:03] to creep into our lives
[36:06] and in our homes
[36:08] because there's not
[36:10] the the prayer life that we should have
[36:15] it seems like it's lacking
[36:19] the devil got a way of making us so busy
[36:22] so busy
[36:25] that we don't have time to pray
[36:28] and when we got time to pray
[36:30] seem like we're exhausted and our
[36:32] strength is gone
[36:35] and
[36:36] the Bible said previous not ceasing we
[36:39] ought to pray always
[36:41] and he said well I pray all day I'll
[36:43] pray all day long I think sometimes you
[36:45] know we walk that way we are constantly
[36:50] meditating and
[36:51] on God and I thank me and my wife would
[36:54] get out walking and I can find myself
[36:56] singing and praying while we walk
[37:01] and um
[37:02] but it's nothing like kneeling down
[37:07] and really crying out to God
[37:10] nothing seems to take the place of that
[37:12] I don't want to prolong the time but I
[37:14] was hoping
[37:16] they got something ready okay
[37:24] go
[37:37] and say Can't Nobody
[37:40] Do Me Like Jesus king Nobody

[43:27] probably God talked about thirst amen
[43:31] but

[43:46] alive
[43:51] says as the heart painteth out to the

[44:22] amen
[44:24] but it's a different thing that come
[44:25] into the presence of God

[44:33] I'm almost we used to have a
[44:39] a title Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[44:43] and today and forever

[44:47] Mullins
[44:48] and then the prophet of God put up be
[44:51] still know that I'm God
[44:54] and then I thought about
[44:56] when I was in
[44:58] Progressive and they would always uh
[45:03] I was glad when he said unto me we would
[45:06] quote that let us go in the house of the
[45:09] Lord
[45:10] and I thought about I was glad
[45:13] when they said unto me let us go into
[45:15] the house of the Lord
[45:17] and I said that seems so real I was
[45:20] happy you know sometimes when we enter
[45:22] the house of the Lord he said come
[45:24] before his presence with Thanksgiving in
[45:27] his courts with what
[45:29] I I mean it tells you what to do and if
[45:32] we don't do it then we are not obeying
[45:35] what the word say isn't that right
[45:37] so but but it is common that
[45:41] we come and we're not uh uh uh doing
[45:45] what he said do
[45:47] we come and we sat back and we locked in
[45:49] on the movie theater something
[45:53] you know what I'm saying but when you
[45:56] come to the house of the Lord amen you
[45:59] don't set back you into you know it's
[46:01] just like you go to a a football game
[46:04] and and you said in the wrong section
[46:06] and all of a sudden the game uh the
[46:10] basketball game going and they need you
[46:13] know they need you to begin root dude
[46:15] for the team to create an atmosphere to
[46:18] intimidate
[46:19] the other people isn't that right
[46:23] but the devil is not intimidated the
[46:25] devil said oh I got y'all
[46:28] I got y'all look at y'all I got you
[46:32] and the devil said
[46:34] go and preach preach

[46:42] damn Say Amen
[46:44] I'm scared if I say Amen
[46:48] I'm scared to say Thank you Lord
[46:51] the devil have people intimidated he
[46:54] said now all the Demons of Hell sitting
[46:56] around telling God look at them look at
[46:58] them do they look like they're happy
[47:01] look at them they won't praise you you
[47:04] see y'all don't think the devil will be
[47:05] doing that stuff but what Jehovah tell
[47:08] you

[47:29] wants you to be sad and miserable and
[47:31] nobody want what you got

[47:44] nightclub they jump in and they're
[47:46] dancing and they look like they're happy
[47:48] somebody want that kind of God
[47:50] and people at the football game
[47:54] they going crazy
[47:56] and you said I
[48:00] I said we serve a living God isn't that
[48:02] right
[48:03] you sat back and I like nobody got to
[48:06] make you serve God nobody got to make
[48:08] you worship God nobody gotta you know
[48:10] work you up and tell you this what you
[48:12] ought to do
[48:16] I know you know when you come to in the
[48:19] Church of the Living God

[1:01:16] so so many people claiming that they're

[1:02:58] going to shame of the thing that's the
[1:03:00] way I used to live the things that I

[1:03:04] that and I don't even want to speak of

[1:03:21] glad God delivered me are you up man

[1:20:50] devil
[1:20:51] serve the Lord and the devil thanking
[1:20:53] they serving the lord but the devil's
[1:20:55] deceiving them all the time
[1:20:57] because God said I'm a jealous God
[1:20:59] and I have no other God
[1:21:01] you can't serve God in mammal
[1:21:04] you got to choose whom you're going to
[1:21:06] serve
[1:21:07] amen amen the devil don't mind you come
[1:21:09] in the trash and shouting and dancing in
[1:21:12] the spirit and going back and doing the
[1:21:15] same old stuff
[1:21:17] but God won't put up with that
[1:21:23] serve the Living God
[1:21:26] Samson
[1:21:27] you know I thought about the church in
[1:21:29] this condition
[1:21:31] probably God spoke a message Church in
[1:21:33] this condition
[1:21:34] I thought about the church in this
[1:21:36] condition I thought about even the
[1:21:38] message believed was in their condition
[1:21:40] I thought about the church and the
[1:21:41] condition that is in
[1:21:43] it's got a
[1:21:44] it's just what you
[1:21:46] it's just what God called people out
[1:21:50] oh denominational systems and calling
[1:21:54] them out of mystery battle them and
[1:21:55] calling them into the word is just what
[1:21:58] he called out huh
[1:22:00] I know he looked down
[1:22:01] y'all
[1:22:04] y'all are y'all happy people
[1:22:10] are y'all really happy
[1:22:15] I don't see y'all shouting and dancing
[1:22:16] and happy
[1:22:18] Lord have mercy I couldn't even dance
[1:22:21] but
[1:22:22] you know
[1:22:24] we went to little parties and I'm
[1:22:26] they're kicking my leg and they thought
[1:22:28] it was a new dance
[1:22:33] because you know you ain't gonna just go
[1:22:36] in there and be looking around and you
[1:22:39] got to go in there you got to move and
[1:22:41] so people start getting around me and
[1:22:44] they stop moving like me I ain't got no
[1:22:45] record
[1:22:48] and they moved
[1:22:51] you know I got people following me and I
[1:22:54] don't know what the world I'm doing
[1:22:56] you know what I'm saying
[1:22:57] and that's what happens but one thing
[1:22:59] about it you're gonna make yourself be
[1:23:02] happy if you're out there serving the
[1:23:04] devil you may not be happy but you're
[1:23:07] gonna fool you know
[1:23:08] see what I'm saying but people come to
[1:23:10] church
[1:23:11] you ought to be free
[1:23:14] they're free to tell God I love you
[1:23:16] when I start thinking about what how
[1:23:19] good God is to me praise God all I have
[1:23:22] to do is go outside just look around
[1:23:24] a secret condition of the word the
[1:23:27] condition of of folk that oh Lord
[1:23:31] there's too many of my friends dead now
[1:23:34] oh you would be and the ones ain't dead
[1:23:37] they might as well be dead sometime the
[1:23:40] way they're living
[1:23:42] are you with me
[1:23:44] but it's a few trying to hold on to
[1:23:46] God's Unchained today
[1:23:48] and you see those they're trying to hold
[1:23:50] on to God's unchanging hand and you can
[1:23:52] see the difference in their life
[1:23:54] they even look
[1:23:56] you know
[1:23:58] they looked at 15 20 years younger
[1:24:02] are you a man
[1:24:03] the others look beat up run now
[1:24:08] on all you see what I'm saying I gotta
[1:24:10] close God is good
[1:24:13] y'all love it
[1:24:16] Samson
[1:24:18] did not know the Lord was had departed
[1:24:21] from him
[1:24:22] and I believe the church
[1:24:24] in its condition don't know
[1:24:26] that the power of God has gone away from
[1:24:29] them
[1:24:33] I believe people are actually saying I'm
[1:24:35] a Christian and they don't have no power
[1:24:41] are you one of them
[1:24:44] Samson had to shake himself he said once
[1:24:48] his locks had growled out because he had
[1:24:52] once he gave God his power but he gave
[1:24:55] Delight of his heart
[1:24:57] delighted
[1:24:59] cut his hair
[1:25:02] and cutting the hair
[1:25:04] was the Nazarite vile he wasn't supposed
[1:25:06] to never drink wine or cut his hair
[1:25:09] because if he cut his hair drank some
[1:25:12] wine then his strength would leave him
[1:25:16] and that's the way it is today
[1:25:21] the sisters are not supposed to cut
[1:25:23] their hair because their hands given
[1:25:25] them for a covering and long hairs for
[1:25:28] Glory
[1:25:29] so they're not supposed to cut their
[1:25:31] hair when they cut their hair they
[1:25:33] showed us that they're not under the
[1:25:34] headship of their husband their head
[1:25:38] are you with me
[1:25:44] are y'all with me
[1:25:47] so
[1:25:48] Thompson cut his hair
[1:25:51] God had his haircut
[1:25:53] the lighter put him to sleep
[1:25:56] and she found out his secret and she
[1:25:58] called in the Philistines to cut his
[1:26:01] hair
[1:26:02] are you with me
[1:26:04] and then she walk
[1:26:06] Samson up and Samson woke up thought he
[1:26:09] was just as strong so the Philistines
[1:26:11] upon you and he shook himself y'all
[1:26:14] gonna find yourself shaking yourself and
[1:26:15] finding the devil is upon you
[1:26:18] and you ain't got no strength to resist
[1:26:20] the devil
[1:26:21] why
[1:26:22] because Samson
[1:26:24] he kept fooling around with the world
[1:26:27] and kept flirting with the World to
[1:26:29] shoot till he lost his anointed
[1:26:32] he lost his strength
[1:26:36] see what I'm saying and that's what
[1:26:38] happened
[1:26:39] a church without power
[1:26:41] would get their eyes plucked down
[1:26:46] when Samson eyes was plucked out
[1:26:49] he couldn't see where he was going
[1:26:52] are you with me
[1:26:54] a church with their eyes plucked out no
[1:26:57] strength
[1:27:00] the devil is laughing at him the
[1:27:02] Philistines were laughing they made
[1:27:04] Sports of Samson they brought him out
[1:27:07] just for the show that Samson that we
[1:27:10] used to have to run from and hide from
[1:27:12] and defeated the the devil
[1:27:15] ain't got no power now
[1:27:17] a church with no power is being laughed
[1:27:20] and it's gone by the devil
[1:27:22] are you with me
[1:27:23] the devil laughed at you you ain't got
[1:27:25] no strength you ain't got no power you

[1:27:30] so they made Sports acceptance but while
[1:27:33] they was making Sports of Samson Samson
[1:27:34] had grow back when it's after how they
[1:27:37] grow back
[1:27:39] and they would had this big meeting
[1:27:43] exception called a little lad and let
[1:27:45] them lead him to the pillow and Samson
[1:27:47] began to pray
[1:27:49] and said Lord
[1:27:51] just once
[1:27:53] more
[1:27:54] just one more time

[1:28:17] you laughing at you because you ain't
[1:28:19] got no strength no more
[1:28:24] the devil laughing picking makes me feel
[1:28:27] sad for the people

[1:28:43] victory in their life than any other
[1:28:45] people on the face of the Earth

[1:29:01] did the world cut your hair
[1:29:04] the Philistines cut your hair took your
[1:29:07] strength away
