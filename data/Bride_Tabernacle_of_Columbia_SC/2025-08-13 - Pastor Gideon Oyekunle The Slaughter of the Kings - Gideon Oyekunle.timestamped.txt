[38:17] remembered in prayers tonight as you
[38:19] signify your desire by the raising of
[38:22] your hands to God while we pray.
[38:25] Most holy and righteous father, we are
[38:27] grateful for another opportunity that
[38:30] you have given unto us as sons and
[38:32] daughters of the king that we should
[38:34] gather ourselves together in your most
[38:36] holy name. Father, we appreciate, we
[38:39] bless, we worship and we adore thee. We
[38:42] lift up your great and thy mighty name
[38:44] on high tonight. Father, hear the sheep
[38:47] of your pasture. I've gathered to hear
[38:50] what the great shepherd we have to say.
[38:53] Oh God, may you please pass by this
[38:55] wave. Speak to our heart and encourage
[38:58] us. Take unbelief out of our heart. Give
[39:01] us, oh God, your holy spirit. Take
[39:05] possession. Let there be healing.
[39:07] Healing of the souls, healing of the
[39:10] bodies. Minister your blessings upon us
[39:13] together. Bless your servant. Oh God,
[39:16] Pastor Henry Simmons. Bless the family.
[39:19] Bless the elders of this church. Bless
[39:22] brothers and sisters. Bless the
[39:24] musician. Bless us together. Bless your
[39:28] word. Speak to us. Encourage us. We
[39:32] thank you, Father. We humbly request all
[39:34] these requests and petitions as we
[39:37] receive them by faith and thanksgiving
[39:40] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[39:42] Christ. Amen.
[39:45] Amen. God bless you. Amen. I I want to
[39:48] say good evening friends. It's a
[39:50] privilege. You may be seated. A
[39:53] privilege to be in the house of God
[39:54] again in this evening. Amen. I just want
[39:57] to say, you know, I'm happy and glad,
[39:59] you know, to be uh part of the service
[40:02] tonight. Amen. I want to, you know,
[40:05] appreciate, you know, the pastor, uh, a
[40:08] good friend, uh, pastor Henry Simmons,
[40:11] and also, you know, sister Simmons. I
[40:14] appreciate you know the love you have
[40:16] you know for me to you know bring me
[40:19] this way and to have some time of
[40:22] fellowship together with the saints
[40:24] purchase of the blood of our lord Jesus
[40:26] Christ.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the and uh you know the blood
[40:31] of Jesus Christ is precious
[40:34] &gt;&gt; but the purchased of the blood is much
[40:38] more precious than the blood because
[40:41] when you want to purchase anything you
[40:44] have to look at the cost and then the
[40:48] reason why you pay for it is because
[40:52] what you are paying for is more precious
[40:55] than the price
[40:56] &gt;&gt; and that's why you give it up and
[40:59] tonight as we are here seated we are the
[41:02] purchased of the blood
[41:04] &gt;&gt; and we are much more precious in the
[41:07] sight of God you know than anything else
[41:11] your soul my soul worth more than 10,000
[41:15] word that's why the scripture says what
[41:19] will a man give in exchange for his soul
[41:23] the price of the soul God paid
[41:28] blood, his own blood. The Bible says we
[41:32] were redeemed by God's own blood.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be identified
[41:40] &gt;&gt; with you tonight. And I pray that the
[41:43] Lord will help me somehow to humble
[41:46] myself before you this evening and then
[41:50] you know that I will say nothing but
[41:52] what the word of God says.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I want to say I bring
[41:59] greetings from Nigeria
[42:01] from the best woman in the whole world.

[43:23] without taking time we shall read from
[43:26] the holy scripture the book of Hebrews
[43:28] in chapter 7 verses 1 to3.
[43:34] Hebrews 7:es
[43:36] 1 to3
[43:38] as we stand in reference
[43:43] to God's word.
[43:52] Several servants of Jesus Christ in
[43:55] Nigeria send their greetings to you and
[43:57] also from the states. Amen.
[44:01] I read Hebrews 7.
[44:05] For this Misedc, king of Salem, priest
[44:09] of the most high God, who met Abraham
[44:11] returning from the slaughter of the
[44:13] kings, and blessed him, to whom also
[44:17] Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first
[44:20] being by interpretation
[44:23] king of righteousness, and after that
[44:26] also king of Salem, which is king of
[44:29] peace, without father, without mother,
[44:33] without descent,
[44:35] having neither beginning of days nor end
[44:37] of life, but made like unto the son of
[44:40] God, abideth a priest continually.
[44:45] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[44:47] holy word. God bless you may be seated.
[44:49] Amen. Thank you so much. I appreciate
[44:51] you know the musician as well. God bless
[44:53] you all. So tonight
[44:56] for a couple of minutes that we have
[44:59] before us, we are speaking on the
[45:01] subject of the slaughter of the kings.
[45:04] The slaughter of the kings. Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Now you can take for meditations the
[45:12] book of Genesis chapter 14 which we are
[45:15] not going to read but I believe you know
[45:17] that we are going to quote you know some
[45:19] scriptures as we go. Now from the holy
[45:24] scriptures that we have read, we were
[45:29] seen or we are seen a picture before us
[45:31] today of a great man by the name
[45:36] Abraham. And the Abraham was the father
[45:39] of the faith. And we know by the
[45:43] scripture that Abraham was called to be
[45:46] an apostle because the word an apostle
[45:49] means a sent one is the same as
[45:53] missionary. The word apostle and
[45:56] missionary they are the same. So
[45:58] therefore you know Abraham was an
[46:00] apostle or a missionary for he was a
[46:04] sjourer and a pilgrim a stranger.
[46:08] Apostle actually means ones that sent
[46:11] out you know from a place. So Abraham
[46:15] was sent of God to a strange land. He
[46:20] was sent of God.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; If you go back to the beginning of the
[46:24] journey of Abraham, we find out that he
[46:28] was coming from the land of Kadia. You
[46:32] know in the city of all according to
[46:34] Genesis chapter 7 uh chapter 11 and
[46:38] chapter 12 we find out that God called
[46:41] him and he separated him you know from
[46:44] his people from all of his associate
[46:47] separated him away from his loved ones
[46:50] and sent him and Sarah his wife into a
[46:54] strange land
[46:56] &gt;&gt; and they were on their way going to be
[46:58] amongst strange people to become to
[47:01] Jonah. And I want to ask you this
[47:03] evening, aren't you happy tonight that
[47:07] you are a stranger?
[47:09] &gt;&gt; That you are a pilgrim that you a
[47:11] sojourer here on earth.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible made us to understand
[47:15] that this world is not our home.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; That's why we sing the song, we are
[47:21] pilgrims and we are strangers here.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; We are seeking for a city to come.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; The boat will soon come to gather the
[47:29] Jewish home. So we are happy tonight to
[47:33] know that we are pilgrims and we are
[47:36] strangers on this earth
[47:40] &gt;&gt; and there's nothing that can hold us
[47:42] back
[47:43] &gt;&gt; for God had a thought of us in his mind
[47:47] &gt;&gt; to spend eternity with him.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; We are object of eternity.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; We belong to eternity.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; We don't just only belong to time. We
[47:58] came from eternity and we step down into
[48:01] time to s John for a moment of time and
[48:05] then you know at the end of it all we go
[48:08] back to eternity.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; So we came from the mind of God
[48:12] &gt;&gt; and we are prim and we are strangers
[48:14] here on earth. So we are so jers here
[48:18] that's the reason why you know Christian
[48:20] we are not bothered you know by the
[48:22] things around us. We are not being
[48:25] influenced you know by the spirit of the
[48:27] day. We are not being influenced by
[48:30] politics. We are not influenced by
[48:33] religious politics, by worldly politics.
[48:36] We are not being influenced you know by
[48:38] economy of this world. Our economy is
[48:41] not determined you know by this world.
[48:44] Our economy is determined by heaven.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Heaven knows you.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Heaven knows me. Heaven is taking care
[48:53] of you. Heaven is taking care of men. We
[48:56] are ordained of God. The Bible said in
[48:59] the book of Ephesians chapter one
[49:01] &gt;&gt; that Jesus that that God ordained us. He
[49:05] elected us. Hallelujah. We were
[49:08] predestinated
[49:10] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Predestination.
[49:16] Hallelujah. Oh, not because we are good.
[49:20] Not because we are perfect, but because
[49:22] God chose us.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham was not perfect.
[49:28] Abraham was not good. But God chose him.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; And tonight, you never sought God. I
[49:35] never sought God. But God sought you.
[49:37] God sought me. And God found you.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why the Bible even
[49:44] told us in the book of Hebrews chapter
[49:46] 9, the Bible says that he purchased an
[49:50] eternal redemption for us. Hallelujah.
[49:53] Eternal redemption. Think about it,
[49:56] brothers and sisters. Our redemption is
[49:58] eternal. And the redemption means to buy
[50:01] back. And the Bible says eternal
[50:04] redemption. That shows that before you
[50:07] were lost, God has paid the price.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; He has found you already. Before you
[50:13] were lost, he saved you.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Before you were lost, he bought you.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Eternal
[50:22] &gt;&gt; in the mind of God, the work has been
[50:24] finished. Hallelujah. That's the reason
[50:27] why there's no man that ever sought God.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; It's God that search for man. Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; You go into the book of Genesis in
[50:36] chapter 3, we find out that when man
[50:38] lost,
[50:39] &gt;&gt; man was hiding away from the presence of
[50:42] God, but God was looking for man.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the voice of God is
[50:47] working.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have you ever imagined that
[50:51] church of God? The walking voice of God.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; The voice of God, not even God, but
[50:58] God's voice
[50:59] &gt;&gt; is working.
[51:01] It's working, brother.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; It's working. Oh my God. God's voice is
[51:06] working.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. And tonight, brothers
[51:09] and sisters, the voice of God is
[51:11] working.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; It's working right here in Colombia.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's working everywhere. He's
[51:18] seeking for the predestinated.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; For every sons and daughters of God, the
[51:25] voice of God. Hallelujah.
[51:28] Oh my. Look at Abraham. Though he was an
[51:32] idol
[51:33] from Babylon, he was worshiping idol.
[51:36] That was Abraham. But brothers, God
[51:40] called him
[51:41] &gt;&gt; to separate himself. Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of Genesis
[51:45] 12:1, he said, "Now the Lord has said
[51:49] unto Abraham, get thee out of thy
[51:51] country, and from thy kindred, and from
[51:53] thy father's house, and onto a land,
[51:55] that I will shield thee, and I will make
[51:57] of thee a great nation, and I will bless
[52:01] thee, and make thy name great, and thou
[52:03] shall be a blessing, and I will bless
[52:05] them that bless thee, and cause him that
[52:08] cursed thee, and in thee shall all
[52:11] families of the world be blessed.
[52:14] Hallelujah.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; And I tell you tonight, friends, we are
[52:18] called to do the same thing.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; We are called to come out of her.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; We are come to come out of Babylon.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Abraham was coming out of Babylon.
[52:28] Hallelujah. The horse of the car. That
[52:31] was Babylon under Nimrod.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; And the God is calling people today out
[52:37] of Babylon.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And the Babylon means confusion. And
[52:41] there's a lot of confusion on her today.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; When you see women marrying women,
[52:48] confusion.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Men marrying men, confusion.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Confusion everywhere.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; You see men marrying their pets,
[52:59] confusion.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It's confusion. Babylon everywhere. And
[53:03] the leaders of the world, they don't
[53:05] even know what to do because there's a
[53:07] confusion.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; It's too much.
[53:11] Confusion everywhere.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; But brother, in the midst of confusion,
[53:15] God is calling the predestinated.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; He's calling the people tonight
[53:22] &gt;&gt; out of confusion. Come out of her, my
[53:25] people. Revelation 18:4. Come out of
[53:28] her, my people.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; There is the voice of God that is
[53:34] working on her today calling the people
[53:36] out of confusion.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] Yes sir.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Come out of Babylon.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Come out of confusion. Don't stay there.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; So many confusions.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; You have no choice. You know to choose
[53:54] your gender. But you know every you can
[53:57] do that today.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Confusion.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Everywhere.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; You look out. You have confusion
[54:04] everywhere.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And Abraham responded.
[54:09] to the call of God to come out of
[54:12] confusion. The Bible made us to
[54:14] understand how Abraham responded in the
[54:18] book of Hebrews in chapter 11 from verse
[54:23] 8 to 10. This is the response of
[54:26] Abraham.
[54:27] The Bible says by faith Abraham
[54:31] when he was called to go out into a
[54:35] place which he should have to receive
[54:39] for inheritance
[54:41] obeyed
[54:43] &gt;&gt; and he went out not knowing whether he
[54:47] went
[54:48] &gt;&gt; by faith he s John in the land of
[54:51] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[54:55] in tabernacles with Isa Isaac and Jacob
[54:58] their ears with him of the same promise.
[55:01] For he looked for a city
[55:04] &gt;&gt; which at foundation
[55:07] &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker is God.
[55:10] Hallelujah.
[55:13] Aren't you happy?
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy tonight. You know the
[55:18] pastor told me is Bible study and we are
[55:21] studying the Bible, right?
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh-huh.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; This was the response of Abraham,
[55:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; When God called him in Genesis 12,
[55:33] Apostle Paul said Abraham obeyed the
[55:37] voice of God that called him.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; And he departed from Babylon.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Not knowing whether he was going.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; He was just only following the voice
[55:50] that called him. Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters,
[55:53] &gt;&gt; when God called you,
[55:55] &gt;&gt; when God called me,
[55:57] &gt;&gt; we obey the voice of God.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; We don't have our mind.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; We don't have our to have our reasoning
[56:06] anymore. But brother, we obey the voice
[56:09] of God.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And we become sojourers
[56:13] &gt;&gt; in the land of promise. Amen.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he became a sjoner, a
[56:20] stranger, a pilgrim in the land of
[56:23] promise.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Why?
[56:28] It was not yet time for him to possess
[56:31] it.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; It's a promise
[56:35] &gt;&gt; that he has to wait for.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; And brothers, this earth is our land.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Everywhere belongs to us. Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Is the land of promise.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 5, our Lord Jesus Christ
[56:51] said that the meek shall inherit the
[56:54] earth.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; It belongs to us.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; We are not going into heaven to live in
[57:03] heaven eternally. When we go in the
[57:05] rapture, we go in the rapture for a
[57:08] moment.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; We've been the rapture for the mar of
[57:12] the lamb. We've been in the rapture to
[57:14] Christ Jesus. But brothers, after this
[57:17] world has been renovated
[57:19] &gt;&gt; and has been taken over and the wicked
[57:23] has been destroyed and the devil has
[57:26] been getting rid of, we shall return to
[57:28] this earth
[57:30] &gt;&gt; and we shall live eternally on this
[57:34] earth.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; It belongs to you and I. God made it for
[57:38] you and I before the ball of sin started
[57:41] rolling in Genesis chapter 3.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; And that's why
[57:48] God came down
[57:52] to redeem
[57:54] &gt;&gt; you and your inheritance.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; To redeem you and this earth.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And the way he redeemed you is the way
[58:05] he redeemed the earth. Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; The where you redeem this earth, that's
[58:10] the way he redeems you in three stages.
[58:13] Water,
[58:15] blood, and the Holy Spirit.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And that's how he's going to get this
[58:20] word re redeemed. He's going to wash
[58:24] this world which he did in the days of
[58:26] Noah. Then Jesus Christ came. He cleans
[58:30] it by his blood.
[58:32] Then the next thing will be what? the
[58:35] baptism of fire.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; That's why you receive the baptism of
[58:40] the Holy Ghost which is the baptism of
[58:42] fire.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; The fire of the Holy Spirit is in your
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; If you are born of the Holy Ghost
[58:50] &gt;&gt; and that's why the root of sin and every
[58:53] devils are taken away from you
[58:56] &gt;&gt; and they going to be taken away from
[58:58] this world and this world will be made a
[59:01] beautiful place to live in. And there'll
[59:04] be another garden of Eden again. And you
[59:07] and I, we shall inherit this earth and
[59:10] we shall live and reign with Jesus
[59:13] forever.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Just love him this evening, church.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen church.
[59:28] Abraham obey.
[59:31] Oh, amen. because he was looking for a
[59:34] future home.
[59:35] So he became a pilgrim in the land of
[59:39] promise. He was looking for a future
[59:40] home for a future home. That was what he
[59:44] was looking for. And he became a pilgrim
[59:46] and a stranger in the land of promise.
[59:48] And brothers, we are pilgrims and
[59:51] strangers.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; We are looking for our future home.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; It's a promise already
[59:56] &gt;&gt; and we are looking for it. And they
[59:58] listen just before we go, we saw that
[1:00:01] when God called Abraham
[1:00:04] over here in Genesis
[1:00:07] chapter
[1:00:09] 14
[1:00:11] verse 13,
[1:00:13] the Bible said that Abraham became an
[1:00:18] Hebrew.
[1:00:20] Abraham became an Hebrew. You see that?
[1:00:24] after he has obeyed the voice of God.
[1:00:27] And there came one that had escaped
[1:00:30] and told Abraham the Hebrew.
[1:00:34] If you watch it, he was not Hebrew in
[1:00:38] Babylon. He was not Hebrew when he was
[1:00:42] in Kadier. He was not. But brothers, he
[1:00:47] became an Hebrew because he obeyed the
[1:00:50] voice of God. And then you know when God
[1:00:53] called him this was Babylon
[1:00:57] and there was a river called river
[1:00:59] Euphrates.
[1:01:01] If you take some study the Bible study
[1:01:05] there's a river called river Euphrates
[1:01:09] that ran the Bible says there were four
[1:01:11] rivers but out of those four rivers
[1:01:15] river Euphrates ran right before the
[1:01:17] throne in Babylon.
[1:01:19] And it has been that way from the
[1:01:22] inception of Babylon
[1:01:25] even till the days of Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:01:28] It went on that way. And that river is
[1:01:31] called river Euphrates.
[1:01:33] And when God called Abraham,
[1:01:36] Abraham crossed that river and he got to
[1:01:40] the other side of the river and then
[1:01:43] they call Abraham. Abraham the Hebrew.
[1:01:47] Hebrew means one that is from beyond.
[1:01:53] That is it was from beyond the river.
[1:01:58] And brothers, I tell you this morning
[1:02:01] for this evening, dear the land
[1:02:05] beyond the river
[1:02:08] that we call the sweet forever.
[1:02:13] We can only reach that shore by faith
[1:02:16] decree.
[1:02:18] For one by one we shall gain that p. You
[1:02:23] are to dwell with ye mothers.
[1:02:26] When the ring that God b for you and me
[1:02:32] brothers, we do not belong here. We
[1:02:34] belong to heaven.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; We are from beyond.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; We have crossed the river. We have heard
[1:02:43] the voice of God over other than the
[1:02:45] book of Gen Revelation. The Bible make
[1:02:48] us to understand that there are 200
[1:02:50] million devils inside river Euphrates
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; and the inside river ues those demons
[1:02:57] have been there from hedges to hes
[1:03:01] and the brothers is a difficult thing
[1:03:04] for you to cross that river
[1:03:07] because it's a Babylonian river that
[1:03:10] kept the people away from the promise.
[1:03:15] He kept them away from the promise. He
[1:03:17] wouldn't allow them to go.
[1:03:20] Denominational river, rivers of creed
[1:03:24] and dogmas, rivers of superstitions,
[1:03:28] rivers of unbelief, rivers of doubt and
[1:03:32] demons are living in there. But
[1:03:36] brothers, upon the call of God, upon
[1:03:38] your life and my life, we heard the
[1:03:41] voice of God and we cross the river to
[1:03:44] the other side and we become Gideon the
[1:03:48] Hebrew.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Gideon from beyond.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Gideon the Hebrew.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy? I'm so happy
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; to know that I am an Hebrew in this
[1:04:06] evening. Hallelujah.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Gideon the Hebrew. Now listen church.
[1:04:12] Upon the call of God upon I mean on our
[1:04:15] lives so we become the Hebrew.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Now listen church. When Abraham become
[1:04:23] the Hebrew, he took some people along
[1:04:26] with him. He took his father. He took
[1:04:29] his nephew
[1:04:32] Lot.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Then it wasn't too long the father died.
[1:04:37] It wasn't too long
[1:04:40] problem started.
[1:04:42] When God called you, God wants you to
[1:04:45] stand alone.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Don't ever
[1:04:50] listen to what any other people are
[1:04:52] saying. God don't want you to take what
[1:04:55] your father will say about it, what your
[1:04:57] mother will say about it, what your
[1:04:58] friends will say about it. God want you
[1:05:01] to listen to his voice and obey.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And the many times you know when God
[1:05:06] call people, people want to
[1:05:09] seek the opinions of others.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; And that's where we put ourselves into
[1:05:14] trouble. But brothers, thereafter then
[1:05:19] there came some problems. The Bible says
[1:05:23] that there were problems between Abraham
[1:05:26] esman and Lot Smen. And then they have
[1:05:29] to do what? Separate. And Abraham said
[1:05:32] to his brother Lot, he said, "Let's not
[1:05:35] fight.
[1:05:37] If you choose to go east, I will go
[1:05:39] west. If you choose to go west, I will
[1:05:41] go east. The land is before us." Abraham
[1:05:44] gave Lot benefit of choice.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; And brothers, that is what Christians
[1:05:49] should always do. We should always
[1:05:51] consider one another.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible say consider one another.
[1:05:56] Consider your brother. Consider your
[1:05:58] sister. Give them benefit of choice.
[1:06:02] Don't you never you know put yourself
[1:06:04] first. Put them first.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Let them make their choosing. God has
[1:06:10] already promised. Let me tell you this
[1:06:12] friends. You know that the promise was
[1:06:15] not for Lot. The promise was for
[1:06:18] Abraham. And you are the one that have
[1:06:21] the promise. They don't have the
[1:06:23] promise.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; The promise is unto you
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; and unto your children
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; and unto them that are far off. And as
[1:06:30] many as our Lord our God shall call.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Only those that God call has that
[1:06:35] promise. And if God call you, brother,
[1:06:38] you have the promise. If God don't call
[1:06:40] them, they don't have the promise. We
[1:06:42] have the promise tonight because God
[1:06:45] called us and we obey the voice of God
[1:06:47] and the full obedience to the word of
[1:06:50] God entitled us to the blessing.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Obey the voice
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; and the blessing will be yours.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; And Lord,
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; he looked and he saw that the plains of
[1:07:13] Sodom was well watered
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; and he chose to go down to Sodom. And
[1:07:18] when Lot went down to Sodom, then what
[1:07:21] happened?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Abraham stayed
[1:07:26] and God said, Abraham,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; where are you standing?
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look east, west, look north,
[1:07:35] south,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; everywhere
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; belongs to you.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Stand up
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; and begin to walk.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Walk in the land.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters, when you
[1:07:48] separate yourself from every unbelief,
[1:07:52] from every doubt, from every fear,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; then the promise of God belongs to you
[1:07:57] at that time. And you can stand on your
[1:08:00] faith and you can exercise your faith
[1:08:03] and you can be walking
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; for the land belongs to you.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; For the promises belong to you.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Walk.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Walk.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Footprint means possession.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; And the in as much as you can walk.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Everywhere you are walking belongs to
[1:08:18] you.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; All the promises in the book is yours.
[1:08:23] Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; All the promises in above are yours.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Take it, brother. Take it, sister.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; God told Abraham, "Your father,"
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; he said, "Stand up. Walk."
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And brother, is the time to walk.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Sister, is the time to walk in the land
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; of promise to exercise our faith,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; to call it our own. Yes.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And Abraham walked everywhere.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. And was claiming every inch of the
[1:09:03] land
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; that the devil stole from him.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; In God's name. Hallelujah. Tonight, our
[1:09:10] brothers, I want to tell you, blessed
[1:09:12] assurance.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Blessed assurance.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All is well.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; All is well. All is well. All is well.
[1:09:24] All is well. All is well. You can stand
[1:09:27] brother by faith tonight and begin to
[1:09:30] walk every inch of the land that the
[1:09:33] devil has taken away from you and claim
[1:09:35] them back in Jesus name. Hallelujah. For
[1:09:39] whatsoever you desire when you pray,
[1:09:42] believe that you have receive it and you
[1:09:45] shall have it.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is the promise of God.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And you believe it, brothers and
[1:09:55] sisters,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; it will be yours.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And Christian brothers and sisters,
[1:10:10] Abraham walked the land
[1:10:13] and he was taken every inch of the
[1:10:15] ground
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; that the devil has stolen from him. But
[1:10:19] brothers, while Abraham was walking,
[1:10:21] Lord enter into trouble. He enter into
[1:10:25] problem.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And do you know what
[1:10:28] happened? The kings came. The Bible
[1:10:31] said, the kings came.
[1:10:35] Amen.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Kings,
[1:10:38] they came. Principalities and powers
[1:10:42] came
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; from different quarters and they
[1:10:48] confederated together.
[1:10:51] Evil spirit kings.
[1:10:56] They all came together
[1:10:58] and what did they do? They took Lot,
[1:11:02] his wife, his children and all the
[1:11:06] sodomites.
[1:11:08] took them away because the king of
[1:11:12] Sodom, the leader of Sodom, they don't
[1:11:15] have enough power to combat those kings.
[1:11:19] Those kings are too powerful. They are
[1:11:22] too strong. They are fierce, their
[1:11:26] hunger. Oh brothers, and I tell you
[1:11:30] tonight, if you don't stay under the
[1:11:33] blood,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; under the token,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The king of demons.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Demons of principalities and power will
[1:11:41] carry you away.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Because Lord
[1:11:48] chose not to stay under the blood.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; He went eastward to Sodom.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; And brothers, that is a sign of
[1:11:57] backsliding.
[1:11:59] A sign of backsliding.
[1:12:01] Don't go eastward. For the sun rises in
[1:12:04] the east and goeth down in the west. So
[1:12:08] Saul I mean a lot was going against the
[1:12:11] sun.
[1:12:13] Instead of him to follow the son and
[1:12:16] stay in the presence of the son, he went
[1:12:19] against the sun backs leading. He was
[1:12:22] going backward instead of going forward.
[1:12:26] And brothers, he backslid and he stayed
[1:12:30] there. And the kings came and fought all
[1:12:34] those kings of Sodom and the and
[1:12:37] Gomorrah and the rest of them. Five
[1:12:40] kings
[1:12:42] and four kings were in the battle. The
[1:12:46] reason is because those kings that came,
[1:12:49] they were more powerful and more
[1:12:51] stronger
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; than the king of Sodom and his group.
[1:12:55] And I tell you tonight, we have a lot of
[1:12:59] people today that they are relying upon
[1:13:03] kings of this earth,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; upon senator, upon governors, upon
[1:13:08] whatever. But brother, there are some
[1:13:11] other kings
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; that are powerful
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; and stronger than the king of Sodom.
[1:13:18] Lost evil spirit.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Are you here? Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; They are more powerful and more
[1:13:24] stronger. Let's quickly read Ephesians
[1:13:26] chapter 6. Ephesians chapter 6 from
[1:13:29] verse 10 to 18. See what the Bible says
[1:13:33] over there in Ephesians chapter 6. From
[1:13:36] verse 10 to 18. And we are going to stop
[1:13:39] shortly. The Bible says, "Finally, my
[1:13:41] brethren,
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; be strong in the Lord."
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; And in the power of his might,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; put on the whole armor of God.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. that ye may be able to stand
[1:13:54] against the wise of the devil.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; For we resto not against flesh and
[1:14:01] blood, but against principalities,
[1:14:04] against powers, against rulershu
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; of the darkness of this world, against
[1:14:09] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; We therefore take unto you the whole
[1:14:15] armor of God, that ye may be able to
[1:14:17] withstand in the evil day. and having
[1:14:19] done all to stand.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Stand therefore having your loins
[1:14:24] gathered about with truth and having on
[1:14:27] the breastplate of righteousness
[1:14:30] and your feet short with the preparation
[1:14:32] of the gospel of peace.
[1:14:34] Above all, taking the shield of faith,
[1:14:38] where we shall be able to quench all the
[1:14:40] fearing doubt of the wicked,
[1:14:43] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:14:45] sword of the spirit, which is the word
[1:14:48] of God.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. G
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; praying always
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; with all prayers and supplication in the
[1:14:54] spirit and watching their with all
[1:14:57] perseverance and supplications for all
[1:15:01] saints. Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; These are the kinds
[1:15:06] of kings
[1:15:08] that came to Sodom.
[1:15:12] And I tell you tonight that the world is
[1:15:16] in sodom condition.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; The world is in sodom condition.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; There are kings in Sodom tonight.
[1:15:26] presidents and governors and senators
[1:15:28] and reps and even preachers, churches in
[1:15:32] Sodom tonight
[1:15:35] and they don't know nothing.
[1:15:38] They just live the way they want to live
[1:15:40] carefree life.
[1:15:43] But brothers,
[1:15:45] there are some principalities
[1:15:47] and powers and the rulers of the dark
[1:15:51] places of this world.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; There are spirits. They are falling
[1:15:57] angels, falling spirits,
[1:16:00] demon power. And they came from the
[1:16:04] kingdom of hell. And they were inspiring
[1:16:08] the people fighting and wrestling
[1:16:13] against the kings of Sodom. And that's
[1:16:16] why they were making all kinds of laws.
[1:16:19] And they can make a law allow women to
[1:16:22] marry women.
[1:16:23] It's not their wish. It's not their
[1:16:27] choice. It is a power that is beyond
[1:16:30] them. There's a power that is
[1:16:33] controlling all. Satan said, "This world
[1:16:37] is mine. He has conquered everywhere.
[1:16:40] He's fought and fought all those kings
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; and he has taken over." Satan has
[1:16:47] conquered all the kings of this world.
[1:16:50] He has conquered presidents. He has
[1:16:52] conquered the governors. He has
[1:16:54] conquered the pastors,
[1:16:57] the preachers, churches have been
[1:17:00] conquered.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; The Oh, hallelujah.
[1:17:03] Is so close to the truth to deceive the
[1:17:06] very elected if it were possible.
[1:17:09] Matthew 24:4 says so. And the devil
[1:17:13] says, "This word is mine." And he wanted
[1:17:16] to conquer our Lord Jesus Christ. And he
[1:17:19] said, "Worship me and I will give it
[1:17:21] unto you." But brother, that was the
[1:17:24] great king, our Lord Jesus Christ. That
[1:17:28] was our Mechised.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; He was more powerful. He was more
[1:17:32] stronger than the devil
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; than all the kings that came down to
[1:17:37] Sodom to fight them and to conquer them.
[1:17:41] And Jesus Christ is undefeable.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; He's unconquerable. He's impable. He's
[1:17:47] all powerful. He's omnipotent. He's
[1:17:51] great. I am that I am. He is our Lord.
[1:17:54] He is our king. Hallelujah. And we are
[1:17:57] the sons of the king.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We are the children of the king.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And we unbeatable brother. We undefeable
[1:18:05] brother.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Because our king is undefeable.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; But all other kings,
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; they have been conquered.
[1:18:17] They have been defeated and many people,
[1:18:21] our loved ones have been carried away by
[1:18:24] those kings that came against Sodom.
[1:18:29] And the way Abraham the Hebrew had he
[1:18:32] said, "No way. I will bring him back."
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; I will bring him back.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of the king.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the king.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I have the sword of the king.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And I have all that the king has.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; I will go and bring him back.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; For those kings, those demons, those
[1:18:58] principalities and powers, they cannot
[1:19:00] take away my brother.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; I will bring him back.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; I am a child of the king.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the king.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of Mechisedc.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will bring him back. And
[1:19:13] Abraham was untrained. He does not have
[1:19:16] the instrument of war.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; He has nothing. But brothers,
[1:19:22] he had 318 men that were born in his
[1:19:27] house. They were untrained. They don't
[1:19:29] know nothing about the systems of this
[1:19:31] world. They know nothing about
[1:19:34] mechanical system. They know nothing.
[1:19:37] Hallelujah. They were ignorant and
[1:19:40] unlearned men. But they have been with
[1:19:43] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Brother Henry
[1:19:47] Simmons, you know, the first time we met
[1:19:50] several years ago, maybe around 10 years
[1:19:52] ago, he talked to me. He said, "Brother
[1:19:54] Gideon," he said, "I am ignorant and
[1:19:57] unlearned men." Hallelujah. And brother,
[1:20:01] I'm happy tonight to be identified with
[1:20:04] ignorant and unlearning men. That is
[1:20:07] what I am. That is what the apostles
[1:20:09] are. That is what the sons of God are.
[1:20:12] That was what Abraham was. And brother,
[1:20:14] we are all ignorant and unlearned men.
[1:20:18] Even though we may have our PhD,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; but we don't rely, we don't lean on our
[1:20:24] own understanding.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; We just get those books in order to for
[1:20:30] school. But brother, we don't rely on
[1:20:32] those things. We have the word of God.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; The absolute is here. The power of life
[1:20:39] is here. We are ignorant and unlearned
[1:20:42] men. But brother, we have been with
[1:20:45] Jesus.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; That is a far better school.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And brothers, Abraham called them
[1:20:52] together.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; He brought them together. He said, "Come
[1:20:56] on, let's form a band and we are going
[1:20:59] to pursue those kings. We'll fight for
[1:21:03] our brother. We'll bring him back."
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Abraham brought those great
[1:21:09] men, amen, you know, together. And they
[1:21:14] form a band. And they went they form a
[1:21:17] band. Then they went from BBA to Dan.
[1:21:22] Hallelujah. Oh my God. My God. Oh my. He
[1:21:28] came along
[1:21:30] way from heaven.
[1:21:33] Hallelujah. Our Lord, our king came a
[1:21:36] long way from heaven.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; He came down and he went down to hell to
[1:21:42] seek for you and I
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; from one corner of Palestine to the
[1:21:46] other. And brothers, today he has given
[1:21:48] us the same commission that this shall
[1:21:51] follow them that believe in my name.
[1:21:53] They shall cast out devils.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; They will lay hands upon the sick and
[1:21:56] they shall recover. And brother, we are
[1:21:58] anointed by the spirit of our Lord Jesus
[1:22:01] Christ. Amen. For him the spirit of him
[1:22:04] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:22:06] dwelleth in you. He will quicken your
[1:22:09] matter body by his spirit which dwelleth
[1:22:11] in you. And brother we have the
[1:22:13] authority tonight over the devil to cast
[1:22:17] him out.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; To say to Satan, get out of here.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; We must take our brothers back.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; We must take our sister back. They all
[1:22:28] belongs to us. Our sons and our
[1:22:31] daughters, we must bring them back.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Satan, you can't hold them.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; They must come back.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Moses said we will not leave our little
[1:22:45] ones behind.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
