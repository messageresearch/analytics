[36:28] Lord, we ask that you just come down and
[36:30] continue to move in our midst this
[36:32] morning. Lord, you said when two or
[36:33] three are gathered in my name that you
[36:35] would be there so we know that you're in
[36:37] our midst. Lord, we ask that you just
[36:39] move and Lord move us out of the way.
[36:41] Lord, anoint our lips, anoint our body,
[36:43] Lord, and anoint us that we may give you
[36:45] all the glory and all the honor and the
[36:47] praise. Lord, to say something that
[36:49] would meet the needs of your people this
[36:50] morning. In Jesus name [music] we pray.
[36:53] Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got your Bibles this
[36:59] morning, we'll turn to the book of Luke,
[37:00] chapter 7.
[37:27] And when you got it, say amen.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; All righty. And it reads, "Now when he
[37:37] had ended all his sayings in the
[37:40] audience of the people, he ended he
[37:42] entered into Capernaum and a certain
[37:45] centurion servant who was dear unto him
[37:48] was sick and and ready to die. And when
[37:52] he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the
[37:55] elders of the Jews, beseeching him that
[37:58] he would come and heal his servant." And
[38:01] when they came to Jesus, they besought
[38:04] him instantly, saying that he was worthy
[38:07] for them he should for whom he should do
[38:10] this. For he loved our nation, and he
[38:14] has built us a synagogue.
[38:17] Then Jesus went with them, and when he
[38:19] was now not far from the house, the
[38:21] centurion sent friends to him, saying
[38:23] unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself, for
[38:27] I am not worthy that thou shouldest
[38:28] enter under my roof. Where wherefore
[38:32] neither thought I myself worthy to come
[38:35] unto thee, but say in a in a word, and
[38:39] my servant shall be healed? For I am
[38:42] also a man set under authority, having
[38:45] unto me soldiers. And I say unto one,
[38:48] go, and he goeth, and to another come,
[38:50] and he cometh, and to my servants, do
[38:52] this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard
[38:55] these things, he marveled at him, and
[38:57] turned about, and said unto the people
[38:59] that followed him, I say unto you, I
[39:01] have not found so great faith, know not
[39:04] in Israel. And they that were sent
[39:07] returning to the house found the servant
[39:09] whole that have been sick. Amen. God
[39:11] bless the reading of this word. You may
[39:13] be seated.
[39:18] Amen. This morning, I'd like to speak on
[39:20] a little topic that I entitled
[39:24] the unmoveable object
[39:28] versus the unstoppable force.
[39:32] The unmovable object versus the
[39:34] unstoppable force.
[39:36] And I was thinking about this and I was
[39:38] reading the story and and I thought
[39:40] about it. I said, you know, this
[39:42] servant, he might have been there was no
[39:44] other hope for him. He had gotten to a
[39:47] point that that his obstacle there was
[39:50] no other hope for him to overcome it.
[39:53] The only way that he had he could
[39:55] overcome it was by the power of God. He
[39:58] had to have someone that believed that
[40:00] God could do it. He had to have someone
[40:03] that would reach out in faith and
[40:04] believe that God could conquer this
[40:06] obstacle that was in front of him. I was
[40:09] reading and I was thinking about the
[40:11] definition. What is an obstacle? It's a
[40:12] thing that blocks one's way or prevents
[40:15] or hinders progress. Many times in life,
[40:18] you'll run into obstacles. You'll run
[40:21] into it whether it's a class, whether
[40:23] it's a person, whether it's a job,
[40:25] whether it's is what you're trying to
[40:28] figure out what to do next with your
[40:29] life. All of these are obstacles, but
[40:32] sometimes you get to obstacles that seem
[40:35] like they're unmovable.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that you can do about
[40:38] them. There's nothing that you can talk
[40:40] to anybody or say about it. These
[40:42] obstacles, they be they seem like
[40:44] they're unmovable. Well, on the other
[40:46] side of the obstacle, there's another
[40:48] force that's working behind it that
[40:50] comes against that combat this obstacle
[40:54] obstacle. And when you see it, you'll
[40:56] think about it and you'll say, "Well,
[40:58] this thing seems to be unmovable, but
[41:00] this force is unstoppable."
[41:02] Cuz when God starts moving, it's
[41:04] unstoppable. So, you got to you got to
[41:07] something that doesn't want to move and
[41:09] something that says, "I can't be
[41:10] stopped." Well, it seems like a paradox
[41:13] to some people, but eventually you have
[41:15] to realize that one has to give way to
[41:17] the other. One has to step aside and
[41:20] say, you know what, this this force is
[41:22] too powerful or the obstacle is too
[41:24] great. Well, when you start to look at
[41:26] it, this centurion, he realized that,
[41:29] you know what, this obstacle is not too
[41:30] great for the force that's going to come
[41:32] against it. When I go to God, I believe
[41:35] that he doesn't even have to come to me.
[41:37] That someone might have said, well, the
[41:38] sickness might have been the their
[41:41] unmovable obstacle. their sickness. This
[41:44] man's sickness might have been it looked
[41:46] like this was the end of his road. This
[41:49] was the end of his journey. There was
[41:50] nothing else that could be done. So he
[41:53] said, "You know what? I'm going to try
[41:54] one more thing."
[41:56] Sometimes you got to get to the point
[41:58] that you come to the end of your
[42:00] obstacle. You tried everything else. You
[42:02] tried to jump over it. You tried to dig
[42:04] under it. You tried to go around it. You
[42:06] tried to go to the left or the right,
[42:07] but it wouldn't move. You can't figure
[42:10] out how to get past it. But I ask you,
[42:12] did you try Jesus?
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Because that's the force that can move
[42:16] the object right on out of the way.
[42:18] That's the force that can come to the
[42:21] object and say and speak to the object
[42:23] and it moves instantaneously.
[42:25] But if it doesn't move instantaneously,
[42:27] you got to believe that when you spoke
[42:29] to it with the faith behind it that it
[42:32] will move. It doesn't matter whether you
[42:34] see it today or tomorrow, it's going to
[42:36] move. Because even though it might have
[42:38] seemed like it was unmovable, there was
[42:40] a power. But there was a force behind
[42:42] it, behind the words that you spoke in
[42:44] the faith, behind the word of God that
[42:46] when you spoke to it, it had to move
[42:48] because God said, "My word can't return
[42:51] it to me void." So it's not you speaking
[42:53] the word. It's not your lips speaking
[42:55] it. It's that you're speaking it and the
[42:57] power that God gave it and speaking to
[42:59] it that it would move. And that you're
[43:01] for sure that the words that I'm
[43:02] speaking, Lord, is not my words, but
[43:04] it's your words. It's what you put in
[43:07] your word and you told me to speak it.
[43:09] So if you told me to speak it, I got to
[43:11] have faith that it's going to do
[43:12] something.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; I got to have faith that what I'm
[43:14] speaking is going to move. I got to have
[43:16] faith that this obstacle, even though it
[43:18] seems unmovable, I don't know how it's
[43:21] going to move, but I know it's going to
[43:22] move.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And when it moves, it's going to
[43:24] dissipate directly out of the way, that
[43:27] I don't even have to see you come. I
[43:29] know that when you spoke the word,
[43:30] something happened. I know that when I
[43:32] spoke the word, something took place. I
[43:35] might not see it today, tomorrow, next
[43:37] week, but I know something had to take
[43:39] place because I spoke your word and I
[43:41] believe that when I sent it forth, it
[43:43] was going to do what I asked you to do.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; See, that's when people they started to
[43:48] look at they look more at the obstacle
[43:50] than they look at the force that's
[43:52] behind them.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; They look more at the obstacle than they
[43:55] trust in the force that's leading them
[43:57] and guiding them and and allowing them
[43:59] to live each and every single day.
[44:02] They're looking more at the problem than
[44:03] they are looking and saying that I don't
[44:05] know what the solution is, but I know
[44:07] there is a solution. I know that the
[44:09] solution is coming forward. And I know
[44:11] eventually the solution is going to show
[44:13] forth. See, I don't have to understand.
[44:16] I don't necessarily have to understand
[44:18] the problem. I got to un I got to trust
[44:20] the one that's teaching me how to
[44:21] overcome the problem. say I got to trust
[44:24] a teacher that's allowed me to go forth
[44:26] and see if you go to school and you and
[44:29] you studying something you are studying
[44:32] at some point in time you have to
[44:34] believe that the teacher can teach you
[44:37] well enough that you can pass the test
[44:41] now some people and they're not great
[44:42] teachers
[44:44] &gt;&gt; so you have to find supplemental help
[44:47] &gt;&gt; to allow you to pass the test cuz the
[44:50] test is going to come regardless of
[44:51] whether you wanted to come or not whe
[44:53] whether you understand the subject or
[44:55] not, the test is going to come. And just
[44:58] like in life, God allows the test come
[45:00] whether you think that you ready or not.
[45:02] You might say, "I'm not ready for that."
[45:04] But God has sent it anyway. Cuz in the
[45:06] process of it, you might not think you
[45:08] were ready, but God had been preparing
[45:09] you for the test to come. And he had
[45:12] been allowing you to go through this and
[45:13] go through that. And you wondering why
[45:15] and why this, but it was all in
[45:17] preparation for the test that was to
[45:19] come. It was all about, you know, I'm
[45:21] leading and guiding you around this so
[45:23] that one day when you face this test,
[45:25] you know that I'm able to overcome it.
[45:27] I'm giving you and building your faith
[45:29] to a point that you can believe that God
[45:31] is able to do it. It doesn't matter what
[45:34] this one or that one says or how they
[45:36] look at your situation, you know that
[45:38] God can overcome it for you. So when you
[45:40] in the classroom and and you have to
[45:42] believe in the teacher that the teacher
[45:44] is going to provide you with the
[45:46] materials to take the test. Even if they
[45:48] don't teach it to you well, they'll
[45:49] provide you with the materials to to
[45:51] take the test. And so at some point in
[45:54] time, you have to have faith and trust
[45:56] in someone. Whether that's your
[45:58] classmates, whether that's your teacher,
[46:00] whether that's the supplemental
[46:01] instructor, whether that's the tutor,
[46:03] you have to have faith in someone.
[46:05] Because when you start to put that
[46:07] faith, you have to believe that they're
[46:08] going to give me the tools that I need
[46:10] to overcome.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; And just like you can put it in someone,
[46:14] this teacher or this or this tutor or
[46:17] this like that, why not trust in God
[46:19] that made all the things that was ever
[46:22] created?
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Why not go to him and say, "Lord, they
[46:25] may not can explain it to me, but I know
[46:27] you can. I know that you can provide a
[46:30] way that I might not understand, but I
[46:32] I've heard testimonies of people said
[46:34] they took a test and the night before
[46:36] they took the test, they dreamed the
[46:38] whole test
[46:40] and the answer to the test.
[46:43] It's one thing to see the test. It's
[46:44] another thing to get the answers to the
[46:46] test. I said, man, that that's that's
[46:49] powerful right there. And and mind you
[46:51] at this they it was so powerful they
[46:54] didn't know it was one of the hardest
[46:56] classes, one of the hardest tests you
[46:57] could ever take. They they you know
[47:00] sometimes when Lord show you something,
[47:02] you get so excited. You get so excited.
[47:05] Oh my goodness, it can't be this this
[47:07] way. But they the Lord allowed them to
[47:10] see the test and the answer. They didn't
[47:12] even get to finish it, but made the
[47:13] highest score in the class.
[47:16] That's what God can do when you have
[47:18] faith and trust in him. when you believe
[47:20] in them and say, "Lord, I believe that
[47:22] the impossible is possible. I believe
[47:24] that even though I can't explain it, I
[47:27] know that you can do the things for me.
[47:29] I have to trust and believe that Lord,
[47:31] the way that you going to provide is the
[47:33] best way for me to go." And I believe
[47:36] that, you know, this might be an
[47:38] unmovable obstacle, but I know that the
[47:41] force that's coming behind it and the
[47:42] faith that I believe in is going to be
[47:45] allow me to overcome this obstacle.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] said, "Nothing is impossible with God."
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God. And and
[47:54] I thought about the story in second
[47:56] Kings 2 Kings chapter chapter 2.
[48:02] And I thought it was fitting.
[48:05] And we know the story of how Elijah, he
[48:07] goes up and the end of his ministry is
[48:10] over and God takes him on this journey.
[48:12] as he's leaving leaving the earth, he
[48:14] takes him on this journey and he goes
[48:16] and on the journey a lot of people was
[48:18] going with him. Then eventually he came
[48:20] to Jordan. He told everybody, "No, y'all
[48:23] stay right here. Y'all stay right here."
[48:26] But there was one person that said, "No,
[48:27] I'm not going to stay right here. I'm
[48:29] going with you to the end of the
[48:30] journey." And Elisha, he and Elisha, he
[48:33] said, "No, I'm going with you." Well,
[48:35] when Elijah came to Jordan, he took his
[48:39] mantel off and he smoked the water and
[48:42] he and he believed that when he smoked
[48:44] the water, the water was going to
[48:45] dissipate. So, it happened and the
[48:48] waters dissipated and they walked off on
[48:50] on dry land on across on dry land in
[48:54] verse 8 and it reads and it says, "And
[48:57] Elijah took his mantel and wrapped it
[48:59] together and smoked the waters and they
[49:02] were divided divided hither and thither.
[49:04] so that the two went over on dry ground.
[49:07] I wanted to show you so you see it. But
[49:09] when we skip down to verse
[49:12] verse 13 and 14, if you go further on
[49:15] the story, which you can read later on,
[49:18] you read the whole chapter and Elijah
[49:20] goes up. He's taken up in the fiery
[49:22] chariot and and God takes him off to
[49:24] earth. But he left one thing. He left
[49:28] his mantle behind. his mantle was
[49:30] basically his coat if you if you don't
[49:33] know but it was basically his coat and
[49:35] it fell off when he when he took was
[49:37] taken up in the chariot and in verse 13
[49:41] and and Elisha he he he also he took up
[49:46] also the mantle of Elijah. So Elisha he
[49:49] was left behind and he take up the coat
[49:51] verse 13 that Elisha fell from him and
[49:54] went back and stood on by the bank of
[49:56] Jordan. See, Elisha had made it across
[49:59] the river. But now he had to go back.
[50:02] And Elijah was no more there. Elijah had
[50:04] gone on. God had took him. But Elisha
[50:06] had to cross back over that river. And
[50:09] he had come back to this thing that
[50:10] someone said, "You know what? I don't
[50:12] know how you going to get past that."
[50:15] You sometimes you tell people what
[50:16] you're going through and it's like, "Oh,
[50:18] I don't know how you going to get
[50:19] through that." Or they'll say, "You know
[50:21] what? Well, that that's your story, not
[50:23] mine." Or they'll say, "Oh, that's your
[50:26] problem. I'm glad God ain't give me
[50:27] that. But but when he got to there, he
[50:30] had in verse 14, it was striking that he
[50:33] said he took up the mantle of Elijah
[50:36] that fell from him and smoked the waters
[50:38] and he said, "Where is the Lord God of
[50:41] Elijah?"
[50:43] &gt;&gt; See, he was looking for the same God
[50:45] that was with Elijah to be there with
[50:46] him.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; He was looking for the same God that
[50:49] brought mama and daddy and all those
[50:51] through to be there for him. He was
[50:53] looking for the same God that pastor and
[50:55] this one might have talked about, but he
[50:57] wanted God to show up right there for
[50:59] him and to allow him to cross this
[51:01] river. See, sometimes you got to lean on
[51:04] and say, "Lord, I've heard testimonies,
[51:06] but now I need my own testimony. Lord,
[51:08] I've heard others speak about you, but
[51:10] Lord, now I need you to do it for me.
[51:12] Lord, I've heard others overcome
[51:14] unsurmountable obstacles. Come off of
[51:17] drugs, come off of this, that, but Lord,
[51:19] I need you to do it for me." Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; It's not good enough for me to hear the
[51:23] stories. It's not good enough for me to
[51:25] see the things. Elisha saw it with his
[51:28] own eyes. It wasn't good enough for him.
[51:30] He said, "God, I need you to part Jordan
[51:33] River just like you did for him for me."
[51:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to lean on nobody's
[51:37] testimony but the one that God was going
[51:39] to give him. So he said, "Where is the
[51:42] God of Elijah?" He didn't say, "Where is
[51:44] Elijah?" He said, "Where's the God of
[51:46] Elijah?" He said, "I'm trusting in the
[51:48] the same one that did it for Elijah. I'm
[51:51] trusting in him to do it for me." And
[51:53] sometimes you got to take that faith,
[51:55] Lord. I've heard you do it for others.
[51:57] So, I'm trusting that you're the same
[51:59] God yesterday, today, and forever. And
[52:02] I'm trusting that you're going to do it
[52:04] for me. I don't know how. I don't know
[52:06] why, but I Lord, I'm trusting in you cuz
[52:08] I understand that you can do all things.
[52:11] And there's nothing left that you
[52:13] haven't seen. There's nothing that's a
[52:15] surprise for you. There's nothing that I
[52:17] can't understand or overcome because
[52:19] you've given me overcoming power.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; See, I got to understand the God that's
[52:25] behind me, that's pushing me forward,
[52:27] that's allowing me to live this life,
[52:29] that's allowing me to wake up every day,
[52:32] every morning, every step that I take
[52:34] and see if he's the same God that can do
[52:36] all of that, I know that he can overcome
[52:38] the thing that's in front of me.
[52:41] [applause]
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that wasn't the end of the
[52:44] story. God was just trying to He was
[52:46] just trying to say, "I got the same
[52:48] faith Elijah got.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; The same faith when he took it. I got
[52:52] that same faith, God. So, I'm expecting
[52:54] you to show up just like you did for
[52:56] him.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; If Elijah didn't trust in the God of If
[53:01] Elisha didn't trust in the God of
[53:02] Elijah, it wouldn't have parted for him.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; If he didn't have the same faith, it
[53:08] wouldn't have parted for him. But when
[53:09] he came there, he had that same faith.
[53:11] That's why he said, "Where is the God of
[53:13] Elijah?"
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Because I know that that's the one true
[53:17] living God that can part the red he
[53:19] parted the Red Sea and then he parted it
[53:21] for him. So I got the same faith. Not
[53:24] only have I seen it done, I want God to
[53:26] do the same thing for me.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And see, I started to think about
[53:30] another story, a familiar story of a man
[53:33] named Gideon. And in Judges chapter 6,
[53:36] and I won't read the whole thing, it
[53:38] goes over three chapters. Judges chapter
[53:40] 6 through through 8, there was there was
[53:43] these enemies that was coming through
[53:45] that came against Israel.
[53:48] And when they came against Israel, they
[53:50] was all they was harassing them for
[53:52] years.
[53:54] And it was because of Israel's fault.
[53:56] Now, did they they they didn't do right
[53:57] in the sight of God. They they they was
[53:59] they had done some wrong things. So, God
[54:01] allowed the enemies to come against
[54:03] them.
[54:04] In verse in chapter 6, I read some of it
[54:07] and starting in verse one. And the
[54:09] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[54:11] of the Lord. And the Lord delivered them
[54:13] into the hand of Midian seven years.
[54:16] Just imagine fighting your going your
[54:19] enemy
[54:20] fighting you and winning most of the
[54:22] battles for seven years. Now seven in
[54:25] the Bible it means completion. So after
[54:28] seven the the the eight means a new
[54:31] beginning. So seven was the year of
[54:33] completion. And he said in verse two,
[54:35] "And the hand of Midian prevailed
[54:38] against Israel, which means they won.
[54:41] And because of of the Midianites
[54:44] of the Midionites, the children of
[54:46] Israel made them dense, which are in the
[54:49] mountains and caves and strongholds.
[54:53] See, the enemy was winning so well that
[54:55] that the children of God decided that
[54:57] they was going to hide. This was the
[54:59] best course of action for me. You know,
[55:02] I'm not going to tell anybody about
[55:03] Jesus. I don't want nobody to know that
[55:05] I'm a Christian.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go out here and witness
[55:10] to nobody because I don't see God
[55:12] delivering me from anything.
[55:15] I I can't tell anybody that God is real
[55:18] because I don't, you know, it's it's
[55:22] those battles that they was fighting
[55:24] when the enemy was attacking them that
[55:26] they decided, you know, I still believe
[55:27] in God, but you know, I I can't witness
[55:29] about it.
[55:31] because I don't see it. If God ain't
[55:34] deliver me, he said he would deliver me
[55:35] from all these things. And let's read on
[55:38] down. [sighs]
[55:40] And he said in verse three, "So it was
[55:42] when Israel had sown that the Midionites
[55:45] came up and the Malachites and the
[55:47] children of the east, even they came up
[55:49] against them, and they camped against
[55:52] them, and destroyed the increase of the
[55:54] earth, till thou came up come unto Gaza,
[55:59] and left no substance for Israel,
[56:01] neither sheep, nor ox, nor ashes." See,
[56:05] when they came and they took they took
[56:07] all the things that might have said
[56:09] blessings. They waited till they did all
[56:11] the hard work, all the hard labor, all
[56:14] the studying. Ever ever ever ever
[56:16] studied all night, all day for weeks and
[56:18] still failed.
[56:22] I've been there. It a It ain't no fun.
[56:25] And and and then you have to have a
[56:28] resolve that's deep down inside of you.
[56:30] It's like, Lord, if you put me on this
[56:32] path,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; thank you. If you put me on this path
[56:36] &gt;&gt; and I believe that you sent me on this
[56:38] path,
[56:40] &gt;&gt; I got to believe that you're going to
[56:41] provide a way out of it. I
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I don't have to understand it, but I got
[56:45] to believe that you're going to provide
[56:46] a way out of it.
[56:49] and said
[56:51] said, "For they came up with their
[56:53] cattle in their tents, and they came as
[56:55] grasshoppers from multitude, for both
[56:58] they and their camels were without
[57:00] number, and they entered into the land
[57:02] to destroy it."
[57:04] And Israel was greatly impoverished
[57:06] because of the Midianites, and the
[57:08] children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
[57:11] And it came to pass when the children of
[57:13] Israel cried unto the Lord because of
[57:15] the Midianites that the Lord sent a
[57:18] prophet unto the children of Israel,
[57:19] which said unto them, Thus sayeth the
[57:21] Lord God of Israel, I brought you up
[57:23] from Egypt, and brought you forth out of
[57:25] the house of bondage, and I delivered
[57:28] you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
[57:30] and out of the hand of the oppressed
[57:32] that oppressed you, and dra them out
[57:34] before you, and I gave you their land.
[57:38] And I said unto you, I am the Lord your
[57:40] God. Fear not the gods of the Amorites
[57:43] in whose land you dwell, but ye have not
[57:45] obeyed my voice.
[57:48] And said, and there came an angel of the
[57:50] Lord, and sat under an oak tree that was
[57:53] in Ofra, that pertained unto Joash
[57:57] the Aizerite, the son of and his son
[58:02] Gideon, threshed wheat by the wine press
[58:04] to hide it from the Midianites. And the
[58:07] angel of the Lord appeared unto him and
[58:08] said unto him, the Lord is with thee,
[58:11] thou mighty man of valor. And and Gideon
[58:14] said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord
[58:17] be with us, then why is all this
[58:20] befallen us?" How many times may God
[58:23] come to you and say something to you or
[58:25] the word is preached and and you go to
[58:27] God with a question?
[58:30] Say, "God, well, I know that you said
[58:32] that I I'm healed. I'm delivered. But
[58:36] then why did you give me the sickness in
[58:37] the first place?
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, I know that you said I'm
[58:41] victorious. Then why did you give me the
[58:42] test in the first place?
[58:45] And Gideon, he went to if the Lord be
[58:47] with us, then why then is all this
[58:49] befalling us? And where be all his
[58:52] miracles which our fathers told us of,
[58:54] saying, did not the Lord bring us out of
[58:57] Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us
[59:00] and delivered us into the hand of the
[59:02] Midianites.
[59:04] See, Gideon was just on the journey. He
[59:06] was looking at an obstacle that he
[59:08] couldn't see no way of overcoming. He
[59:11] was looking at a at a test that he
[59:13] couldn't see no way that he was going to
[59:14] pass it. He was looking at something
[59:17] that might that was insurmountable in
[59:19] the moment because he was a prisoner of
[59:21] the moment. He had heard many stories,
[59:23] but those stories wasn't doing him no
[59:25] good. He had heard many testimonies, but
[59:28] those testimonies, he was like, "I've
[59:30] heard the testimonies, but God, uh, that
[59:32] ain't doing nothing for my situation.
[59:35] That's not doing nothing for what I'm
[59:37] going through right now. That's not
[59:38] doing nothing for what what I'm facing
[59:41] right now." He said, "Where be all the
[59:43] miracles? Where be all the signs and
[59:45] wonders? Where's the God that they
[59:47] always talked about?"
[59:50] And then the angel showed them forth
[59:52] that, you know what? I am a true servant
[59:53] of the Lord. I came to you with the
[59:55] message that God is going to use you to
[59:57] deliver my people. And so and once once
[1:00:00] he realized that you know what this
[1:00:02] wasn't for play or for show. This was
[1:00:04] the real servant of God that came and
[1:00:06] spoke these things to him. He got faith.
[1:00:09] He realized you know what this is the
[1:00:11] same God from yesterday that they always
[1:00:13] spoke about. This is the same God and
[1:00:15] he's going to deliver us out of out of
[1:00:17] the hand of the Midianites. Not only did
[1:00:19] that, he he got such a testimony that
[1:00:22] others decided, you know what? I can
[1:00:24] join forces with you. I believe just
[1:00:26] like you. And so many people start
[1:00:28] joining the the the army. Oh my
[1:00:30] goodness, everybody got faith now. See,
[1:00:33] sometimes it only takes one to believe.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; It only takes one to believe. It only
[1:00:38] takes one to step out in faith to ignite
[1:00:41] the whole place. Ignite the whole
[1:00:42] church. Ignite everyone around you to
[1:00:45] believe that all things are possible.
[1:00:47] Even though we don't understand how we
[1:00:48] going to defeat the enemy, we going out
[1:00:50] in faith because we know that the enemy
[1:00:52] is defeated.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; There was so many people that decided to
[1:00:56] join the army that God said, "No, I
[1:00:58] can't use all of them. I didn't call all
[1:01:01] of them to go out in in there. Maybe
[1:01:03] they going to be more of a hindrance
[1:01:04] than a blessing."
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "I got to bring it on down."
[1:01:08] So, he gave him a test and and certain
[1:01:10] people passed the test unbeknowingly and
[1:01:12] some people didn't. That was okay. It
[1:01:14] wasn't that anybody was supposed to be
[1:01:16] excluded. God just had the select few
[1:01:18] that he wanted. He just had the select
[1:01:21] few that he was going to use to allow
[1:01:23] them to overcome the enemy and said
[1:01:27] they came up to the army and then they
[1:01:30] had many things that happened.
[1:01:34] They had many things that happened when
[1:01:36] they came up to the to the army and and
[1:01:39] when they when when they when when they
[1:01:42] got around the enemy near the enemy. But
[1:01:45] I wanted to show you in chapter 7 and
[1:01:47] verse 6, he said when he gave him the
[1:01:50] test and he chose which men was going to
[1:01:53] be there, he said the number of them
[1:01:55] that lap putting their hands to their
[1:01:57] mouths were 300 men, but all the rest of
[1:02:00] the people bowed down upon their knees
[1:02:03] to drink water. See, that's when God, he
[1:02:06] separated them from the many from the
[1:02:08] few. He separated the many from the few
[1:02:11] and he said, "You know what? I'm going
[1:02:13] to allow you to do something that might
[1:02:14] have seemed impossible. I'm going to
[1:02:17] take these 300 and we going to defeat
[1:02:19] all the Midianites. Now, I started
[1:02:22] reading and I and I got got really
[1:02:23] enthralled in the story. So, if you go
[1:02:26] down here, just to put it in context in
[1:02:28] chapter 8 and verse 10, I'm going to
[1:02:31] show you how many people actually was
[1:02:33] with them with the Midianites.
[1:02:36] He said,
[1:02:38] "Now Za [snorts]
[1:02:40] and
[1:02:41] Zamana were at Kor and their host that
[1:02:47] were with them were about 15,000 men.
[1:02:51] All that were left of all the host of
[1:02:54] the children of the east. From there
[1:02:56] fell 120,000 men that drew the sword."
[1:03:00] God used 300 to take out 120,000.
[1:03:07] 300
[1:03:09] to take out 120,000. Now you talk about,
[1:03:13] you know, the enemy is quadruple, triple
[1:03:15] that whatever you want to use. That's a
[1:03:18] whole lot more than than than you be and
[1:03:22] everybody it ain't 300 people might be
[1:03:24] in here. So is 300 to take out 120,000.
[1:03:29] You said, "How is that possible?" Well,
[1:03:31] first of all, God let them think that it
[1:03:33] was a greater host of enemy coming
[1:03:35] against them than what was at the 300.
[1:03:37] God used the used confusion. He allowed
[1:03:40] them to take out each other versus
[1:03:42] taking out the enemy. And they wasn't
[1:03:44] coming against Israel. They was taking
[1:03:46] out each other. Some of them probably
[1:03:48] ended up losing their lives because
[1:03:50] other was trying to run to get away. You
[1:03:53] know, God used anything. Sometimes you
[1:03:56] don't know how God is going to take care
[1:03:58] of your enemy or take the obstacle out
[1:04:00] of the way, but sometimes God will let
[1:04:02] them be confused and let you go right on
[1:04:04] along. Said that that's what he used for
[1:04:07] them. And he allowed them to defeat the
[1:04:10] enemy. But when they when when they got
[1:04:13] a little bit of victory, they wasn't
[1:04:14] satisfied. Gideon, they killed the two
[1:04:17] princes, but they wasn't satisfied. When
[1:04:20] they killed the two princes, they went
[1:04:21] on. They said, "We haven't destroyed our
[1:04:23] enemy yet." This ain't all that God gave
[1:04:26] us. We got a little bit of victory, but
[1:04:28] we want the rest of it. He went and
[1:04:30] called his friends and he said, "Y'all
[1:04:32] y'all meet them at the river right down
[1:04:34] there and y'all take care of some of the
[1:04:35] enemy." Well, when he got to the
[1:04:37] friends, they got mad at him. Said, "Why
[1:04:38] you didn't invite us to the fight in the
[1:04:40] first place?" Cuz God ain't tell me to
[1:04:42] do that.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; They got mad at him. Some people say,
[1:04:46] "Why you didn't get me to pray?" Well,
[1:04:48] God, when he directed me to ask for
[1:04:50] prayer, he didn't direct me to ask
[1:04:52] everybody. He said, "Go to this one and
[1:04:54] that one." And sometimes you can't be
[1:04:56] offended when God uses this one or that
[1:04:58] one, but doesn't use you.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; You see, God has a purpose and a plan
[1:05:02] for what he's trying to get for it and
[1:05:04] what he's trying to do.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; See, Gideon, he went and told them, and
[1:05:08] after that, he said, "Listen, y'all took
[1:05:10] out all these, what y'all mad at?" They
[1:05:12] said, "Oh, yeah, you're right." So, they
[1:05:15] went on they but but the fight wasn't
[1:05:17] over. Gideon and his 300, they kept
[1:05:19] chasing. Well, when they got when they
[1:05:21] got to a certain place, they got they
[1:05:24] were hungry and they have been fighting
[1:05:26] all day long and they have been fighting
[1:05:28] and they kept going and they kept going
[1:05:30] and they got to some certain places and
[1:05:32] they and they went and they asked for
[1:05:33] some help. Many of times you think some
[1:05:36] people are your friends and they not cuz
[1:05:39] when you go to them for help, they be
[1:05:40] like, "I don't know you." They can't
[1:05:43] remember the times that you gave them
[1:05:45] help. They can't remember the times that
[1:05:47] you answered the phone late at night.
[1:05:49] They can't remember the times all that.
[1:05:51] They just are in their season of what
[1:05:54] what they call
[1:05:56] they they seem to be in a prosperous
[1:05:58] season.
[1:05:59] They don't remember the lowly moments
[1:06:02] when you were giving them encouragement
[1:06:03] that God can still make it and do all
[1:06:06] these things. So they was they was like,
[1:06:08] you know what? Nah, we ain't going to
[1:06:09] help you. But they didn't understand
[1:06:12] that it wasn't Gideon that was talking.
[1:06:14] Gideon said, you know what? You don't
[1:06:16] help us. Guess what? But we coming back
[1:06:18] and we going to destroy y'all too.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; So they went on on the journey. They
[1:06:23] went to some other people and they got
[1:06:25] the same spirit. It jumped from them to
[1:06:27] the next people and they said, "You know
[1:06:29] what? We ain't going to help y'all
[1:06:30] either." He said, "Don't worry about it.
[1:06:32] We come back to take care of y'all,
[1:06:33] too." So when he got done, he was able
[1:06:36] to defeat those enemies and also the
[1:06:38] people that said that that they thought
[1:06:40] that they could run to and have help
[1:06:41] from. He took care of all of them. See,
[1:06:44] God will take care of your enemies, your
[1:06:46] fmies, and the people that you think are
[1:06:48] on your side, too. He'll show you
[1:06:50] exactly who they are. He'll let your
[1:06:52] eyes be open so you can see, hey, them
[1:06:54] ain't my real friends. He'll let you
[1:06:57] see, oh, you know what? I can't go
[1:06:59] confide in them. Oh, I can't go talk to
[1:07:01] them like I thought I could. Because God
[1:07:03] is sometimes opening your eyes that you
[1:07:05] can go further in him, but you can't
[1:07:08] take everybody along with you. You can't
[1:07:10] go on and you can't say, "You know what?
[1:07:12] I'm going to take this one and that
[1:07:13] one." God has his journey for you and
[1:07:16] for you alone. He had that journey for
[1:07:18] for Gideon and those 300 men. If he
[1:07:20] would have took some others, they might
[1:07:22] have got tired and decided to quit.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; But he had them cuz he knew that they
[1:07:27] was going to last the whole journey. He
[1:07:29] knew that they was going to continue to
[1:07:30] fight on until they got complete and
[1:07:32] total victory over all their enemies
[1:07:35] that could come against them. He knew
[1:07:37] that, you know what, this obstacle that
[1:07:39] they were fighting against, they didn't
[1:07:40] have to see it no more after today. As
[1:07:43] long as they kept fighting and kept
[1:07:44] going, and they believe that God could
[1:07:46] do what he said he would do.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; He said in verse 28 and verse 8, he
[1:07:54] said, "Thus was Midian subdued before
[1:07:56] the children of Israel, so that they
[1:07:58] lifted up their heads no more, and the
[1:08:01] country was in quietness 40 years in the
[1:08:04] days of Gideon." God did such a work
[1:08:07] that that people, you know what, they
[1:08:08] said, "We ain't even going to fight them
[1:08:10] no more." We saw what God did for them.
[1:08:13] We saw the 300 defeat the 120, 140,000
[1:08:17] people. We not going to fight them cuz
[1:08:19] if that's what God could do with 300.
[1:08:21] Just imagine if they got on one accord
[1:08:23] and started to fight together. Just
[1:08:26] imagine if they decided to band together
[1:08:28] and believe all with one accord that God
[1:08:30] could defeat their enemies. Just
[1:08:32] imagine, it don't matter how big our
[1:08:34] army is. It ain't greater than the God
[1:08:36] that they got allowing them to come
[1:08:38] against us.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; So when they realize that and they could
[1:08:41] stand on that and believe that then they
[1:08:43] can move on and and they could fight and
[1:08:45] they could go on. They said, "You know
[1:08:46] what? We going to give them peace
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; because the one that's leading them
[1:08:50] believe and that God is with them."
[1:08:54] Said that that they realized that God
[1:08:56] was there and he was able to to bring
[1:08:59] them out.
[1:09:01] He said the prophet of God I was reading
[1:09:02] and he said he was talking about Israel
[1:09:05] and he was talking about he said but
[1:09:08] when he come forth and fight against
[1:09:10] them and taken from the from the people
[1:09:15] he was talking about Moses going into
[1:09:16] the children and going into the land uh
[1:09:19] the promised land and he said God told
[1:09:21] him and told Israel or Israel vowed to
[1:09:23] God if he would deliver the king into
[1:09:26] his hand that he'd utterly destroy the
[1:09:28] the man. And it's and that's a type that
[1:09:31] gay. If God will give you the spirit,
[1:09:33] the Holy Spirit,
[1:09:35] utterly destroy the sin out of your
[1:09:37] life. Move on. Nothing can stop the
[1:09:40] church. They may call you a fanatic.
[1:09:42] They may call you call call you simply
[1:09:45] to pack a Bible. They may say that
[1:09:47] you're a holy roller or whatever they
[1:09:49] do, nothing's going to stand in God's
[1:09:51] church. She's moving towards Canaan. And
[1:09:54] if you don't, if you don't go, God's
[1:09:56] going to take them that will go. That's
[1:09:58] right. He that church there's nothing.
[1:10:01] It's an irresistible force. That's
[1:10:03] right. And God will move everything.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "And God will move everything."
[1:10:08] And I I believe that this morning that
[1:10:10] there's nothing that can stand in the
[1:10:12] way of those that believe in God.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stand in your
[1:10:16] way if you trust in God. If you believe
[1:10:19] that God is able to do it, there's
[1:10:21] nothing that can stand in your way.
[1:10:23] There's no demon, no devil from hell
[1:10:25] that can say, "You know what? I got
[1:10:26] victory over you." No, you don't. Cuz
[1:10:28] God gave me the victory. It doesn't
[1:10:30] matter whether it's today or tomorrow
[1:10:32] that I see this victory, but God gave me
[1:10:35] the victory. So, I'm going to trust on
[1:10:37] it. I'm going to stand on it. I'm going
[1:10:39] to believe that when he died and shed
[1:10:41] his blood, that there was no demon in
[1:10:43] hell that could come against me, that
[1:10:45] could attack me, that could overcome me
[1:10:48] because I believe that God did it for
[1:10:50] me.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And I can have faith. I can stand in it.
[1:10:54] Whenever the devil comes, I can point
[1:10:56] them back to that blood that was shed
[1:10:59] for me way back on Calvary. See, when I
[1:11:02] understand the words come off the pages
[1:11:04] and they have a meaning to me,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; they have a life that lives on all by
[1:11:09] itself that I realize that I'm covered
[1:11:11] by the blood that I'm covered under the
[1:11:13] blood that I'm standing I've been washed
[1:11:16] in that blood and God ain't come down.
[1:11:18] And if you and if you haven't gotten
[1:11:20] there, you need to get that relationship
[1:11:22] with God that you can stand on it. That
[1:11:25] you can stand on the word of God that
[1:11:27] you can stand in faith and say, "Lord, I
[1:11:29] don't know how. I don't know why, but I
[1:11:31] believe that you can do it for me."
[1:11:34] [applause and cheering]
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "I'm not looking to my left or
[1:11:37] looking to my right. I'm trusting in the
[1:11:39] one that does all things. I'm trusting
[1:11:42] in the one that can remove the
[1:11:44] obstacles, that can overcome the test,
[1:11:47] that can overcome the the demons and
[1:11:50] devils of hell that might be fighting me
[1:11:52] every single day.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; So, I'm believing in the one the force
[1:11:57] that's the power of God.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; If you didn't know the force that I was
[1:12:01] talking about, it was the power of God.
[1:12:03] And when when when you understand that
[1:12:06] there's a power that God has that no
[1:12:08] devil in hell can touch, no devil in
[1:12:11] hell can overcome, no devil in hell can
[1:12:14] defeat, is already giving you the
[1:12:16] victory. All you have to do is believe.
[1:12:19] All you do is have to do is have faith
[1:12:21] that God is able. That God is able. That
[1:12:25] God is able. That God is able. That God
[1:12:29] is able. That God is able. [applause]
[1:12:32] And you don't move from that. You don't
[1:12:35] stay be persuaded any other way. But God
[1:12:37] is still able. And God is still able.
[1:12:40] Even when I fall, God is still able.
[1:12:43] Even when I stumble, God is still able.
[1:12:45] Even when I don't understand, God is
[1:12:47] still able. Even when it gets worse, God
[1:12:50] is still able.
[1:12:53] [applause]
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; See, I'm believing in the God that can
[1:12:56] do the impossible.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And and then sometimes you got to touch
[1:13:00] and agree with somebody else. Hey, come
[1:13:02] here and let's stand on it together that
[1:13:04] God is able to do this for me.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; See, I don't have to lean to my left or
[1:13:10] the right, but I may go to a brother and
[1:13:11] sister in prayer in confidence and say,
[1:13:13] "Stand on this with me. Let's watch and
[1:13:16] see what God will do. Let's stand on it.
[1:13:18] Let's watch and see what God will do."
[1:13:20] And then we sit there and we wait for
[1:13:22] God to do it. That when we get up in the
[1:13:24] morning, we say, "Lord, I know that
[1:13:25] you've already done it. Lord, the next
[1:13:27] day, I know that you already done it.
[1:13:30] and the next day. Lord, I know that you
[1:13:31] already done it. Lord, you didn't do it
[1:13:33] yesterday, but I believe you're going to
[1:13:35] do it today. Well, if you didn't do it
[1:13:37] to last night, I know you'll do it
[1:13:39] today. Lord, I'm standing on it. I'm
[1:13:42] standing on it. I'm building my faith,
[1:13:44] Lord. I believe. I'm not doubting. I'm
[1:13:46] not wavering. I'm not stumbling. I'm not
[1:13:48] falling. I'm believing that you're the
[1:13:50] God that's able to overcome.
[1:13:54] [applause]
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; See, that's what I'm standing on. That's
[1:13:57] what I'm believing God to do. That's
[1:14:00] what I'm trusting God to do. I don't
[1:14:02] understand it, but I know he can do it.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Let us all stand.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; See, that's what I'm trusting in.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; You wonder why I come to church and I
[1:14:13] can be happy is because I know that God
[1:14:16] has already done it for me. I know that
[1:14:18] God is already moving in my life. I know
[1:14:21] that I don't understand it, but I know
[1:14:23] he's doing the things. I may not see the
[1:14:25] complete thing, but I know that God is
[1:14:27] doing it.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, let us bow.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we come before you today,
[1:14:35] Lord, we know that we may face some
[1:14:37] unsurmountable obstacles. Lord Jesus, we
[1:14:40] know that we might face some things that
[1:14:42] we don't understand. But Lord, this
[1:14:44] morning, Lord, we want to step out on
[1:14:46] faith. Is there anybody here this
[1:14:48] morning said, "Lord, I have a need. I
[1:14:51] have something that I'm going through. I
[1:14:52] have a desire, Lord, that I I need you
[1:14:55] to come and do something in my life.
[1:14:58] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Lord,
[1:15:00] you see all the hands that are lifted,
[1:15:02] Lord. I lifted my hands cuz Lord, I have
[1:15:04] something that I have placed before you,
[1:15:06] Lord. And Lord, I'm standing today and
[1:15:09] Lord, Lord, I might not have done it
[1:15:10] before, but Lord, I'm going to step
[1:15:12] forward in faith, Lord, and said, Lord,
[1:15:15] if I don't even see it, I know that it's
[1:15:17] possible. Lord, I know that you're going
[1:15:19] to do it for me. And Lord, I'm asking
[1:15:21] today that you come and strengthen our
[1:15:23] faith. Lord, come and move in a mighty
[1:15:25] and a special way that we can testify
[1:15:27] and have testimonies of this day and
[1:15:30] what God has done for us. Lord, we're
[1:15:32] trusting and believing that you continue
[1:15:34] to move and you continue to touch every
[1:15:37] heart and every need and every heart's
[1:15:39] desire. Lord, that there's someone here
[1:15:41] that has not turned their life to you.
[1:15:44] If you say this morning, Lord, I'm not
[1:15:46] in this place, but Lord, I want to give
[1:15:48] my heart to you this morning. And that's
[1:15:50] your heart's desires. I wonder if you
[1:15:53] just lift your hands this morning.
[1:15:56] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:58] You see all the hands that are lifted,
[1:16:00] all the hearts that are open, Lord. We
[1:16:02] ask that you just come in and touch
[1:16:03] these hearts, Lord. And we ask that you
[1:16:06] come in and be the savior over their
[1:16:08] lives. that today after this day they
[1:16:10] can walk in a way that they can say that
[1:16:12] my life has been changed. Lord, those
[1:16:15] that are seeking and want to take the
[1:16:17] next step and say, "Lord, I want to be
[1:16:19] baptized." Lord, we ask that they just
[1:16:21] come and they just continue to give your
[1:16:24] life to them and continue to Lord work
[1:16:26] in them. And if there's one this morning
[1:16:28] that said, "I would like to be baptized
[1:16:30] this morning." If you want to lift your
[1:16:32] hands,
[1:16:34] Lord, you see all the hearts and the
[1:16:36] hands. And Lord, we ask that you
[1:16:38] continue to move. And Lord, we ask that
[1:16:40] you continue to build a deeper and
[1:16:42] closer relationship with you with each
[1:16:44] and every one of us this morning. Lord,
[1:16:46] we ask you continue to move in our
[1:16:47] midst. Touch our hearts. Touch our
[1:16:49] desires. Lord, in Jesus name we pray.
