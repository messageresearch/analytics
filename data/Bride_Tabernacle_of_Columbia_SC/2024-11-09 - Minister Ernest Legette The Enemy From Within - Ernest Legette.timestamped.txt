[30:50] at the Book of Numbers by the grace of
[30:52] God numbers 13 a very familiar scripture
[30:56] [Music]
[31:06] I said I always feel like you know like
[31:08] Jacob and I was looking at that again
[31:10] the other morning and how he was praying
[31:15] he was asking God he says you know I
[31:17] ain't worthy of the least of you know
[31:19] your
[31:20] mercies but he says God you know you
[31:23] promised me just summ it up that you
[31:25] chose me and I just I know I ain't
[31:28] worthy of the least of it but I thank
[31:31] you for it amen I feel that way all the
[31:33] time that we ain't worthy of the least
[31:36] to God mercies sometimes we feel that as
[31:40] though you shouldn't feel that way but
[31:42] sometimes as a person might feel like
[31:44] God owed him something but God don't owe
[31:47] us we owe him everything only thing that
[31:50] we can give him is our praise for what
[31:52] all he's done for us
[31:54] amen numbers 13 by the grace of God if
[31:57] you got it say amen
[32:04] amen we'll start here at the at the
[32:07] first verse and it reads and the Lord
[32:11] spake unto Moses saying send thou me
[32:15] that they send thou men that they may
[32:18] search the land of Canaan which I give
[32:21] unto the children of Israel of every
[32:23] tribe of their fathers shall ye send a
[32:26] man everyone and rul among them you may
[32:28] be see it go down a little bit further
[32:32] amen down drop down to
[32:35] the to the we'll skip down don't read a
[32:39] whole lot we'll look here at
[32:42] the 21st verse you got to say amen and
[32:47] it reads so they went up and searched
[32:50] the land of the Wilderness was in to
[32:52] Rayo as men came come to hammoth and
[32:56] they ascended by by the south and came
[32:59] to Hebron where a
[33:02] hon shishi and taline the children of an
[33:06] were now Hein was built seven years
[33:10] before Zone in Egypt and they came into
[33:12] the brook of es escol and cut down from
[33:15] then a branch with one cluster of grapes
[33:18] and they buried between two upon a staff
[33:21] and they brought up the pomegranates
[33:24] brought of the pomegranates and of the
[33:26] figs the place was called The Brook
[33:29] escal because of the cluster of grapes
[33:31] which the children of Israel cut down
[33:33] from then and they returned from
[33:35] searching of the land after 40 days and
[33:38] they went and came to Moses and Aaron to
[33:41] all the congregation of the children of
[33:43] Israel to the Wilderness of pan and to
[33:46] cadesh and brought back word unto them
[33:50] and to all the congregation and showed
[33:52] them the fruit of the land and told them
[33:55] and said we came unto the land will thou
[33:58] sent us and surely it floweth with milk
[34:02] and honey and this is the fruit of it
[34:05] nevertheless the people be strong that
[34:09] dwell in the land and the cities are
[34:11] walled and very great morever we saw the
[34:14] children of anic there the malachit
[34:17] dwell in the land of the South and the
[34:18] Hittites and jebusites and amorites
[34:21] dwell in the mountains and Canaanites
[34:23] dwell by the Sea and by the coast of
[34:26] Jordan and Caleb's steal the people
[34:28] before Moses and said let us go up at
[34:31] once and possess it for we are well able
[34:34] to overcome it but the men that went up
[34:37] with him said we be not able to go up
[34:40] against the people for they are stronger
[34:43] than we and they brought up an evil
[34:46] report of the land which they had
[34:48] searched to the children of Israel
[34:50] saying the
[34:52] land through which we have gone to
[34:54] search it there a land that eateth up to
[34:57] in heav thereof and all the people that
[34:59] we saw in in it are men of great statue
[35:03] and there were and there we saw the
[35:07] Giants the sons of anic which came of
[35:10] the Giants and we were in our own sight
[35:13] as Grasshoppers and so were we were in
[35:17] their sight may God bless the reading of
[35:19] his word again tonight by the grace of
[35:22] God just for a moment I want to minister
[35:25] on uh the Enemy Within amen
[35:28] the enemy from within amen you know I
[35:33] was sitting here and I just kind of been
[35:36] ministering on this for a little bit now
[35:39] taking it from several different angles
[35:41] but I say you know we know that I said a
[35:46] lot of times great kingdoms you know
[35:49] fail and they didn't fall necessarily
[35:53] from their enemies without but a lot of
[35:56] times they fail to fall Started From
[35:59] Within they started you know fighting
[36:01] amongst each other from within and next
[36:04] thing you know some of the people from
[36:06] within probably started you know going
[36:08] along with the enemies and all but the
[36:10] fall would have never happened if they
[36:11] would have stayed together unified
[36:15] but the the the the fall fell the fall
[36:20] began from within amen so a lot of times
[36:24] you see that I was talking the other
[36:26] week and you know the prophet of God was
[36:28] saying about you know uh how how how
[36:32] gossip is in the church it's like seuic
[36:36] acid it'll eat a church up right it'll
[36:40] destroy a church and sometimes even the
[36:43] stuff that says might not even be true
[36:45] or you know just going over that but I
[36:47] don't want to talk too much about that
[36:48] tonight but I just says you know there A
[36:50] lot of times if if the people would stay
[36:53] unified then the Devil Couldn't defeat
[36:55] them but what happened s with is I
[36:59] always say you watch and the devil's
[37:03] tearing up somebody else home and you
[37:04] watch and don't pray for that family or
[37:06] don't pray for them but just talk about
[37:09] them or certain thing I say is when the
[37:10] devil get done with them he's coming to
[37:12] you next
[37:14] but we look at it you know as we
[37:17] fighting this fight together amen y'all
[37:20] believe that tonight we're not like in
[37:23] in it's an individual Affair your your
[37:25] walk with God is an individual
[37:28] but when I say we fighting because you
[37:31] know we are the bride of Christ we are
[37:33] the people we the brothers and sisters
[37:36] of of God right so when one is going
[37:39] through that ought to hurt you right
[37:42] when one child like we always say if one
[37:45] child is is is is uh being the devil is
[37:49] tearing up their life or having effect
[37:51] on one child that it's not that you say
[37:54] that this is this these that family's
[37:56] child or that child but we look at it as
[37:59] these are our children amen because it's
[38:02] the truth y'all believe that amen come
[38:04] on one member of the body hurt the whole
[38:06] body hurt amen right the pinky the hand
[38:10] however we say it sometimes but I said
[38:13] we we in an hour right now where we
[38:14] can't afford to fight one another anyway
[38:16] amen because we got too many enemies too
[38:20] many demons to fight put it that way
[38:22] right so it's a Praying time I believe
[38:25] that with all of my heart it's time that
[38:28] if you ever need to get in contact with
[38:30] God now is the time amen but we find
[38:32] that like we say the enemy from with
[38:34] think or we find that a lot of times
[38:36] like we say we look and wor about those
[38:40] without but we want to deal with what's
[38:42] within tonight right your greatest enemy
[38:45] like we always say is yourself amen you
[38:49] are your greatest enemy amen you are the
[38:52] reason why you ain't where you should be
[38:54] in God right sometimes say oh because of
[38:57] this and that no if if you desperate
[38:59] enough you'll find a way to get to God
[39:01] amen amen if you desperate enough right
[39:05] if nobody else comes to pray with you if
[39:07] you when you desperate enough you'll
[39:08] Pray by yourself amen when you desperate
[39:11] enough when you really need God when you
[39:12] come to the conclusion or or the wit
[39:15] that I need God come on I need him for
[39:18] my when you get desperate enough it
[39:20] don't matter who comes who goes who's
[39:22] who's going to go the distance which is
[39:24] you going to go because you know when
[39:26] you're desperate amen now it becomes
[39:28] between life and death to you it may be
[39:31] natural death but I'm talking about
[39:33] death of the Soul tonight come on where
[39:36] is your Eternal destination right
[39:38] sometimes you got to rustle you got to
[39:40] find that out but I says you are your
[39:42] greatest enemy right we say that tonight
[39:45] I say you you are your greatest enemy
[39:47] but a lot of times like I said is that
[39:49] you know we don't realize that but God
[39:51] has to let us step back and see that
[39:54] right come on he can't it's time now we
[39:57] don't put the blame on on everybody but
[40:00] that's always been man's way to point at
[40:02] somebody else come on we can talk go all
[40:04] way back to the Garden of Eden and how
[40:06] Adam pointed at Eve Eve point at the
[40:08] serpent it's always to point at somebody
[40:10] else but you know I God loves the man
[40:13] that that acknowledges his
[40:14] transgressions amen come on that was key
[40:19] in in in in David's
[40:22] life David was a man after God's Own
[40:24] Heart but one thing that was key about
[40:27] David I said it like that was David
[40:29] didn't
[40:30] mind admitting that he was wrong amen he
[40:34] didn't mind admitting admitting I'm said
[40:38] that he messed up amen right when his
[40:42] sins was brought before sometimes he
[40:44] could have just been caught up in the
[40:45] moment but when his sins was called out
[40:48] he didn't get upset when Nathan did he
[40:50] amen come on now he
[40:53] didn't but he acknowledged his wrongs
[40:56] didn't he amen and he laid before the
[40:58] Lord and he began to repent and say Lord
[41:02] create in me a clean heart because it
[41:04] was that was key in his life he was
[41:07] willing to acknowledge his wrongs right
[41:09] what's wrong today people can't
[41:11] acknowledge their wrongs amen can they
[41:14] come on you say what if a prophet did
[41:16] come tell me well I want to say you know
[41:19] a lot of times the minister of the
[41:21] Gospel getting up preaching you know if
[41:24] he's up there preaching something that
[41:26] he knows what's going on just to Target
[41:29] people like the prophet of God said he
[41:30] got no business in the pull pit anyway
[41:32] amen amen but when that man don't have a
[41:35] clue what's going on but he gets up
[41:37] there and just preaches the word amen
[41:39] come on then what it what is that that's
[41:42] God right speaking to you giving you a
[41:45] word now are you willing to acknowledge
[41:48] your transgressions amen come on cuz you

[45:13] way of delivering us right that's
[45:17] unorthodox that might be the word I was
[45:19] thinking

[45:23] context
[45:25] peculiar that might be a better word
[45:27] he's got a way of of delivering you

[47:59] your mind can become your own enemy
[48:02] y'all believe it come on it's it says by
[48:05] worriation these are some of the
[48:07] symptoms headaches stomach aches muscle

[48:30] the unhealthy behaviors like
[48:34] overeating come on worriation got a lot
[48:37] of things it can mess you up on one of
[48:40] the things that this is one of the
[48:42] things that really really stuck out to
[48:44] me it says if it sticks around long
[48:47] enough something as small as a
[48:51] nagging concern in the back of your mind
[48:56] can have effect on your
[48:59] heart it can make you more likely to
[49:02] have high blood pressure a heart attack
[49:06] or even a
[49:07] stroke come on it says something as
[49:11] small as just a little nagging in the
[49:14] back of your mind if it stay around long
[49:17] enough look what it could do come on I
[49:21] said it's so the devil tonight come on
[49:24] but one thing about it what why do we
[49:27] have to worry when when God is we know
[49:30] God is in control of all things amen
[49:33] come on we know that God if you you got
[49:37] to know that though you see you got to
[49:38] know that God has ordered your footsteps
[49:41] amen you got to know who God if you
[49:43] don't know then these things will get
[49:44] hold to you but you got to know who God
[49:47] is amen and see that was the problem we
[49:49] won't have time tonight that was the
[49:51] problem with Israel I said the enemy
[49:53] from within Israel God had brought them
[49:56] through so many things didn't he amen so
[49:59] many battles the Lord had wed for him oh
[50:03] yes come on brought him out of
[50:05] bondage come on brought brought the
[50:08] plagues and all a man 80y old man with a
[50:11] stick in his hand all he had was thus
[50:14] sayith the Lord come on Amen but that
[50:17] word that he had from God that's where
[50:19] the power was come on the power wasn't
[50:22] in Moses the power wasn't even in the
[50:24] stick but the power was in God amen when
[50:27] God got hold to it come on Amen lot of
[50:31] the things what God had done for them
[50:34] God brought them through all those
[50:37] things I like how he says he I raised
[50:39] Pharaoh up for this purpose that I might
[50:41] show my power in Earth amen because
[50:44] before that time nobody had known the
[50:47] power of God like that but he wanted men
[50:50] to know how powerful he was amen come on
[50:54] so after when I get done now they'll
[50:57] know that I'm just more than just the
[51:00] one that spoke to Abraham come on called
[51:03] him out but I'm they'll know about my
[51:05] power when I get done with them amen oh
[51:08] Jesus and that's what God wants to do in
[51:10] our life he don't wants you just to be a
[51:12] normal just come in and out of church
[51:14] and don't experience the power just hear
[51:17] about it read about it but God wants you
[51:19] to know how powerful is amen oh Jesus
[51:23] amen that's why he allow things to come
[51:26] sometimes and he shows you glimpses of
[51:28] the power yes Lord but somewhere in the
[51:30] journey you forget about the power
[51:33] hallelujah amen oh sometimes you got to
[51:36] stir up your pay Mind by the way of
[51:39] remembrance and realize that he's the
[51:41] same yesterday today and forever what he
[51:44] did once he can do it again amen oh God
[51:48] do it again amen oh Jesus come on no
[51:53] matter how much the the the church might
[51:55] be going in into this formality come on
[51:58] or into this relaxed State amen God
[52:02] isn't relaxed he's still moving amen
[52:05] people are still seeing the power wake
[52:08] up let God move in your life my God is
[52:12] still living Hallelujah come on now
[52:15] that's what stirs us up because I know
[52:17] I'm serving a living God Amen come on
[52:22] but out of all the out of all the the uh
[52:26] things that God did for them right the
[52:29] Red Sea all the bread from Heaven the
[52:33] the the water in from the Rock and
[52:35] fighting all their enemies and all the
[52:38] things that God done that's the thing
[52:40] about it if you read a little further
[52:42] God was upset because he said they tried
[52:45] me they proved
[52:48] me and I did what I said I do I did what
[52:52] I promised I'd do they proved me but the
[52:54] biggest thing was yet they still don't
[52:56] believe me they still struggling with
[52:59] faith hallelujah amen oh Jesus out of
[53:03] all I done like somebody would have
[53:06] believed me come on same thing today
[53:10] right after all God has done come on
[53:13] just to save you from where you was at
[53:15] took a miracle I know for me it did
[53:19] Hallelujah changed me from who I was to
[53:22] what I am now that was a miracle amen
[53:25] come on that's why I always say God if
[53:28] you don't do nothing else you already
[53:29] done enough and I'm for real that's the
[53:32] truth hallelujah am oh God Lord but I
[53:36] said one thing about it after all God
[53:40] did for them is Israel was going to find
[53:43] out that their greatest enemy wasn't the
[53:46] amalekites wasn't the jebusites weren
[53:49] all those come on those weren't their
[53:51] greatest enemies the greatest enemy they
[53:53] was going to find out was they their own
[53:55] self amen come on
[53:58] Amen the Bible says they a't go in
[54:00] because of unbelief that was the enemy
[54:02] come on Amen the thing about it was even
[54:05] I was meditating on this for a while
[54:08] even after all that God done and God
[54:12] told them go out and spy the land
[54:14] Hallelujah and they went out and they
[54:17] spy it not only did they spy it but they
[54:19] brought back the fruits that was in the
[54:21] land amen come on Amen they brought back
[54:25] the grapes the pomeg oh Jesus amen they
[54:29] brought back the
[54:31] goods and the thing about it was you
[54:35] know when Moses he didn't just send
[54:36] anybody out but he got the leaders of
[54:38] the tribes come on didn't he he got the
[54:42] heads get the leaders let them go out
[54:45] spider
[54:46] land it's sad to say it but 10 out of
[54:49] the 12 leaders came back with a bad
[54:51] report amen come on Amen didn't they
[54:54] amen 10 out of the 12 say come back
[54:57] stirring up unbelief in the camp didn't
[55:00] they amen come on oh
[55:03] Jesus but I said the thing was you know
[55:07] they come back with the very fruits even
[55:11] testifying of it right come on
[55:14] testifying yes sir of the of of
[55:18] everything is just like what God said it
[55:20] is amen come
[55:22] on I want to ask you the question
[55:25] tonight do you think God God brought you
[55:26] this far to leave you come on let me ask
[55:30] you that you think God brought you this
[55:32] far to leave you sir come on God ain't a
[55:35] God Like That Hallelujah he's not a God
[55:38] that can't finish the job amen he's not
[55:41] one that only see you halfway through
[55:44] but God is one that can take you on
[55:48] Hallelujah but you got to let God take
[55:50] you home amen you got to let him finish
[55:54] the work that he started in your life
[55:56] but sometimes what happens I don't know
[55:58] about you but when when the Lord saved
[56:01] me you know you was in such a shape that
[56:04] you knew you couldn't get yourself out
[56:06] of that amen you was helpless
[56:09] hopeless and all of a sudden now this
[56:12] Mighty God come on the scene amen
[56:15] hallelujah and he do the things for you
[56:18] that nobody else couldn't do come on
[56:22] amen he was your friend in those
[56:25] loneliness when everybody else walked
[56:27] away come on God picked you up cleaned
[56:31] you off now nobody can't even recognize
[56:34] you sometimes right oh Jesus amen but
[56:38] sometimes after God clean you up you
[56:41] forget about God come
[56:43] on oh Jesus God got to remind us
[56:48] sometimes amen like he did Israel say
[56:52] your mom mother when she had you she
[56:53] left you out in the street covered in
[56:55] blood come on everybody walked by you
[56:59] looked at you and said die but when I
[57:01] saw you I said Live come on God got to
[57:05] remind us
[57:06] sometimes that you might be set up now
[57:09] but you still need me hallelujah amen
[57:12] you still need my grace you still need
[57:14] my Mercy oh Jesus God I need your mercy
[57:19] Lord I need your grace even right now oh
[57:23] Jesus come on God got to remind us yes
[57:26] but what it was I said they was going to
[57:28] find out that they was their worst enemy
[57:31] come on you know when they got to the
[57:34] land if they would only have faith come
[57:38] on as Joshua and Caleb but the Bible
[57:40] said they was of another Spirit if they
[57:42] had only had Faith then nothing would
[57:45] have been able to stand in front before
[57:47] before them
[57:49] nothing can you imagine that the only
[57:53] believe no enemy would have been able to
[57:55] stand before
[58:00] but like we said the enemy from within
[58:04] you know the scriptures kept saying that
[58:07] when they begin to talk about the land
[58:09] they said we saw come on we
[58:14] saw we saw
[58:16] Hallelujah at that point their eyes
[58:19] become their own enemy didn't it come on
[58:23] Amen your eyes can become your own
[58:27] enemy come on what we saw we saw this
[58:30] yes we know what God Said and we know
[58:33] that God is all powerful but come on our
[58:37] enem what we saw is big bigger than
[58:41] us it might be bigger than us but it
[58:44] ain't bigger than God Amen come on Amen
[58:48] oh Jesus I said things might be hard
[58:52] situations might be tough might be big
[58:56] yes it might be bigger than me but one
[58:58] thing about it Greater is he that is in
[59:00] me than he that is in the world no
[59:03] matter how big it is it ain't bigger
[59:05] than God Amen come on Amen oh Jesus amen
[59:10] God is greater than all these things
[59:12] amen I don't know about you but that
[59:13] stirs me up I believe that come on I
[59:17] says the thing about it was
[59:19] Joshua and and Caleb they went and they
[59:22] saw the same things other spies saw
[59:24] didn't they come on they saw it but the
[59:28] only difference
[59:30] was like we said the other other day
[59:33] only difference was one of them come on
[59:37] they was looking at it not through their
[59:40] natural eyes but they was looking at it
[59:43] through the eyes of the promise that God
[59:44] had made him come on the promise that
[59:48] God had made him was stronger than any
[59:50] enemy that was in the land the promise
[59:53] that God had made them was more powerful
[59:55] than all all the Giants the wall cities
[59:58] and all that the promise that God had
[1:00:00] made them I don't know how but I know
[1:00:03] what God said to me amen oh Jesus I
[1:00:07] don't know when but I know what God said
[1:00:09] to me amen and he can't he's not a man
[1:00:12] that he should lie he ain't going to
[1:00:14] break his promise but he'll do just what
[1:00:16] he said I'mma wait on him amen come on I
[1:00:19] don't know about you but I said I'm
[1:00:21] going wait on them Hallelujah come on
[1:00:24] Amen but what it is like said the enemy
[1:00:26] from within they found out that all the
[1:00:29] others weren't the enemy they were their
[1:00:31] own enemies come on Amen their worst
[1:00:33] enemies wasn't they cuz after that God
[1:00:36] turned them away hallelujah amen and for
[1:00:40] 40 years God was grieved with that
[1:00:43] Generation all because they couldn't
[1:00:46] believe out of all the signs and wonders
[1:00:49] they
[1:00:50] saw out of all the Miracles out of all
[1:00:53] the mighty revivals they had come
[1:00:58] on they struggled with faith didn't
[1:01:02] they they struggled to just believe you
[1:01:05] know one thing I said all those other uh
[1:01:08] trials were just just to get them ready
[1:01:12] for the climax come on was wanting to
[1:01:16] build their faith and build their faith
[1:01:19] but here at the climax now they
[1:01:22] struggling with just simply believing
[1:01:25] God amen come
[1:01:27] on taking God at his word but yet they
[1:01:31] let worriation and other things get
[1:01:35] there come on oh Jesus you know one
[1:01:39] thing like the prophet of God was
[1:01:41] bringing out I like he was saying that
[1:01:44] they struggled one thing they could
[1:01:47] didn't know how to accept was God's
[1:01:50] grace come
[1:01:53] on but we find the same thing today it's
[1:01:58] hard for a man just to accept that it's
[1:02:01] God that's doing it Hallelujah come on
[1:02:04] but they always felt like feel like they
[1:02:06] got to have something to do with it amen
[1:02:09] come on they got to do something they
[1:02:11] got to have something to say well I did
[1:02:13] this or whatever come
[1:02:15] on but to realize that this whole
[1:02:18] journey their whole journey was by Grace
[1:02:21] God made the the father's a promise and
[1:02:24] he came and got them grace and mercy
[1:02:27] brought them to this point but they
[1:02:29] struggled with it Hallelujah come on
[1:02:33] they they couldn't accept God's grace
[1:02:37] and we find the same see it's
[1:02:38] unbelievable it's hard to believe that
[1:02:41] God done the work and you don't have to
[1:02:42] do nothing Hallelujah that's it it's
[1:02:45] hard to believe that the devil have you
[1:02:48] in your mind always thinking it's
[1:02:50] something you got to do whatever but the
[1:02:52] struggle you struggling with it instead
[1:02:55] of just opening your arms freely
[1:02:58] Hallelujah and say God I just received
[1:03:00] what you did for me I couldn't do
[1:03:03] nothing on my own anyway God it was all
[1:03:05] you and I'm just receiving what you done
[1:03:08] for me come on I'm just riding the grace
[1:03:11] of God hallelujah I'm just riding the
[1:03:13] mercy of God realizing there's nothing I
[1:03:17] could do but it was all him Hallelujah
[1:03:19] come on but when you all in the way come
[1:03:21] on then you become your worst enemy come
