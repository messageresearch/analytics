tonight lord jesus lord thank you for allowing us to come together in lord we ask that you bless your word lord jesus anoint us and lord give your people exactly what they're ended in need of tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen at this time we turn to the book of exodus the 14th chapter we'll start at the fifth verse that's exodus chapter 14 and we'll begin reading that the fifth verse when you gotta say amen amen exodus chapter 14 the fifth starting at the fifth verse and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us and he made ready his cherry and took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with a high hand but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen in his army and overtook them and camping by the sea besides before bow zephan bill zephan and when pharaoh drew not the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no grace in egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of egypt is not the is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it has been better for us to serve the egyptian than that we shall die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace amen god bless to read another word you may be seated amen on tonight we'd like to take a little topic don't give up amen don't give up in this story the prelude to the story the children of issue where children of israel had been in bondage in egypt for over 400 years and they were serving pharaoh but one day god sent them a deliverer he sent moses back to his people to deliver his people and after many plagues that god had dealt on the egyptians the pharaoh finally let god's people go but on the way going he he realized what a mistake he had made and so he went after the children of israel and he found them by mountains on ones mountains on the right mountains on the left and the sea in front of them he said i got him boxed in now and so he went uh he went up and he thought he was going he was going to overtake him and put him back in slavery but god came before reading the scripture of his moses moses went to the lord and the lord said why cry to me he said speak and he went to the he went to he went to deliver his people but god had a plan but the people was ready to give up they was ready they came to that point they said you should have left me in egypt where i could have just served pharaoh to the end of my days and died in egypt in peace but god wanted something better and they but they was at that point they said we could have just we should have just gave up but they couldn't see that god never gave up on them and so they they got to that point they said we sh we could have but moses said fear not stand still and see the salvation of the lord because the egyptians that you see this day you'll never see them again amen and it goes on in verse 14 it said the lord shall fight for you so they didn't even have to fight they never lifted a hand a sword no instrument or weapon against the egyptians god went on this story progressed that god drowned them all in the red sea while they walked away on dry ground and they said they would take that testament to with them for generations and generations until this time but the moral that i wanted to come to is that that no matter what the circumstances look like you can't give up no matter how bad it looks mountains on the right mountains on the left and the sea in front of you and the pharaoh behind you you can't give up because god always has that plan for you amen and when we look at the different instances in the in the bible that the lord drew me to that show me uh what happens if you don't give up if you go to second let's turn to second kings chapter two second kings chapter two and we'll start at verse one when you gotta say amen amen second kings chapter two and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not legally leave thee so they went down the bethel and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thee from thy head today he said yes i know it hold ye your peace and elijah said unto him elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to has sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as my and as thy soul live it i will not leave thee so they came to so they came to jericho and the sons of the prophet that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him noah style that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace and elijah said unto him terry i pray thee here for the lord has said unto sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not lead thee and they went to and they too went on and fifty men of the soul of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they too stood by jordan and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided hither and thinner so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were going over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elijah and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken away from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so amen in the scripture if you look at it elijah knew that he was going home it was his time his his ministry at india elijah knew not only him but the prophets that every time they went to a city or a place they knew and they asked elijah like why are you going on you know he's going to die why you keep following him if you know that he's going to die but elijah he never gave up because he wanted something he wanted something from he knew that he had a desire and he wanted something if he would have gave up the first time he would have never got what he wanted well he had other people trying to convince him say why why why you keep going with him why you keep pressing on don't you know he going to die and he said hold your peace yes i know but hold your peace because elijah knew elisha knew that he wanted something he had a desire that he wanted to fulfill and it wasn't finished yet so he kept going the next city he came to and elijah said stay there elisha even elijah even told elisha to stay there and elijah said i'll tear you on as your soul living i'll keep moving on with you wherever you go i'm going and a lot and elisha kept following them until elijah finally got to the place where he was to go home and he said basically he paraphrasing he was basically like what do you desire and elisha told him i want a double portion so many times we get to the point the prophet of god said and anytime we get to the point where we have we have our deliverance or our healing but we give up we give up believing we give up trusting that we have it we give up with having that faith that is there that we have that god has given it to us all we have to do is believe he said if you can only get the people to delete to believe that all things are possible so if you had the faith of a mustard seed it can move mountains so you can't give up for what you want and what you ask god for because if it's his will nothing can stop can stop it from happening amen and elijah in this elijah he pressed on because he wanted he had that desire if you go to the book of genesis chapter 32 you read about jacob and his brother esau jacob had wronged his brother esau and he was finally going to meet him for for for a final time for another time and he hadn't seen him in years and jacob was afraid jacob was afraid but one night the angel the lord visited him and a lot and jacob realized he said i'm not i'm not letting go of this uh of this angel i'm not letting go until till something happen so elijah wrestling elijah wrestle jacob russell my bad jacob wrestler and he wrestled with the angel and he kept wrestling with him but he wouldn't let him go in there and the angel implored him he said he said let me go so the day is coming the sun is getting ready to rise the day is coming and a lot and jacob said i'm not letting go until you bless me he said you can hurt me he smote him on the thigh but he said i'm not letting go until you bless me no matter what you do what come my way i'm not letting it go until you bless me and sometimes you have to take that to the lord lord i can't let go until something happened in these situations and these things that are rising in my life lord i can't let go until something happened if i let go too early it's not going to happen anyways so what do i have to lose i have nothing to lose but i continue to fight i have nothing to lose but i continue to pray i had nothing to lose but i continue to say thank you nothing to lose to give you glory and give you praise because what i've seen you already do i know that you the same yesterday today and forever and he's able and more more than able to do exceedingly abundantly than water we can ask the thing so if you go on in the scriptures there's even more where in first corinthian paul urges us to be steadfast unmovable always abiding in the word of the lord amen and just holding on to what god has promised us there's so much so many things that sometimes we miss all the benefits we miss some of them because we don't hold on long enough to to trust god to do it we don't hold on and we don't stay there and stay steadfast on our knees and say lord till you get that breakthrough you stay steadfast there until god start moving and you see the changes you start seeing things happen before you you start seeing those people come back and turn fr and turn back and you see god start to do things and you said lord i can't give up because what you've done for me i know you can do it for someone else i what you what you've already displayed and people around me and people in the in the midst of in the midst in the sanctuary with the church of god i know that you can do it for someone else so i i put my faith i put my trust in you because i know that you are you are able god you never failed and you said that your word can't turn return to your void abraham in the bible he had to wait 25 years on his promise with people coming against him and saying why you believe in that that's just a figment of your imagination that ain't happening i can imagine the things the many things that people tried to tell him and convince him that it wasn't gonna happen that it wasn't he wasn't gonna have that promised son abraham had to wait 25 years sometimes it's hard for us to wait 10 minutes that's 25 years of something that you know that god has told you and people coming around everywhere you move they saying you show you sure i don't see it happening yet you said you're going to be the father of many nations how how are you going to be that one and you don't have a c you don't have a child but yet abraham stayed fast he held on to the to the word that the lord gave him and he said and he proved it and he said i'm going to hold on until it happened come what may come say whatever you want i believe that god has placed me here and he chose me to do this he chose me it wasn't nobody else that he came and gave that word to it was only meant for abraham so god so god knew that abraham was going gonna be able to to hold on to that word and even god tested him later when when isaac was born he he tells him to go take him up and to offer him as a sacrifice and abraham almost came close to to to sacrifice knowledge but god put a ram in the bush he never gave up on that promise that lord you said that i was going to be the the father of many nations and he kept holding on to that he kept believing that that no matter what i'm not going to give up i can't give up because god has given this to me and he has positioned me for this each and every one of us i think that god could have put us in any time in any age in any space but he put us here now because god knew that we'd be able to to stand this test that god has given to us in this age and i think that sometimes you wonder and then sometimes you look around and say lord why me but i can't study on that because god placed me here if you know that that you're standing on him and he and you talking to him and he's talking to you and god has placed you here then you can't give up on the journey the journey gets rough sometimes the journey gets hard and sometimes the devil all he does is he doesn't have to do big things he just has to place a seed of doubt just one small seed of doubt where you doubt one thing and then it becomes infinitely easier it becomes a whole lot easier to doubt something else but in in you have to stay with the word of god stay with the bible and take everything back through the bible if it ain't in there then then leave it alone if if there's nothing but the word of god i can say yes and amen to it amen because i can't give up on god and what he has sent for me it may not be for everybody but i know that the lord has positionally emplaced us in this in this age that we can continue to hold on and not give up he'll continue to give us the word of god that encourage us and push us forward and allow us to see more and more lord what you're doing for us and bringing forth the signs and the wonders so lord we can see you moving in our midst we can see that you working and you're doing great things not small things so sometimes we we get small-minded we we limit god not god limited us we limit god and say well lord i only want this and it'd be a small when we we should ask for the big things we should ask for the big things and hold them and hold on to it and ask god lord i know that you've done it before so why not me why not me why can't i why can't i i receive what what you've given because you promised it if you promised blessings they there they there they sitting up there and they just waiting on me to get ready to receive it i got to be in the place in the space that god has put me in so that i can receive it i got to be positionally placed in in the in the will for my life for that god has planned so that i can receive what god has given but i can't give up i can't give up yeah you may not be where you want to be but sometimes you look back and say i i'm not where i was but god if i keep continue to following you and not giving up on you you continue to push me forward you continue to place me where you want me to be so that i can receive what you've chosen for me in this life because god you're the same yesterday today and forever and i can hold on to that till eternity that you guide you the same yesterday today and forever and there's nothing that i can do nothing that anybody can say because when you know that god is real for yourself you you know that god has has done some things for you you can look forward to what he's going to do what he's going to be able to do in other people's lives even around you says sometimes i've seen it even in my life even recently while i've seen god bless me but bless everyone around me you want to be in a position where god not only bless you he blesses everyone they said the many kings that said abraham lot got blessed because of abraham by being under his bosom he got blessed because of him he said i if i don't give up maybe that'll encourage someone else not to give up maybe god has me sometimes all it takes is a small light to shine in the darkness it only takes a spark to light up to light up a whole room sometimes that's what you got you got to keep that in mind when you're walking in places walking into work walking in the store lord shine the light in the darkness because the world is dark there's a lot there's a lot of darkness everywhere you go it's darkness but lord if i can bring a little little bit of light shine a little bit of light encourage somebody push somebody forward lord sometimes it's not all about going and getting and forcing the word down to somebody sometimes it's just showing them kindness showing them some love showing them that somebody care somebody is out there somebody actually god placed me on your heart i just wanted to see how you were doing and sometimes i said all the time people may not remember what you buy them people may not remember all the things that they do but they will remember how you treated them they always will remember how you treated them and it caused me to look back and say lord i want every interaction that i had to reflect you every single interaction sometimes you know you look back and you say lord i'm sorry i didn't respond right lord i'm sorry i didn't i didn't do that right but lord let me allow me to to show that that you are inside of me and that you're working and that if i don't give up and you continue to work you'll mold me and make me to everything that you want me to be amen okay praise god god is good amen we thank the lord we manage not to give up amen no matter what comes to what goes where not to give up on god amen we're in a day where so many of the bible says in the that there'll be a a great fall in the way so many people will give up he said times would come amen men would love the world more than they would love god and he says in second thessalonians he's talked about the great fall in the way amen and um that's what is happening you know so many people they don't want to they don't want to come to church no more and people are struggling to come to church the god that they say they love the god that they say they love but other things are getting in in people's way they just seem as though the devil is so crafty he's so tricky that he's deceiving so many people by letting other things get in front of god you know god actually do small things like forsake not to simulate ourselves together a little small thing but you know when it comes down to the end of the road god knew if he accessed to do that he said that i'll be in the midst that's what he that's where he wants to bless us amen when we come together you know what you know people you know when they got out when everybody shut in and they couldn't go to the beach and they couldn't go to the nightclub and they couldn't go party like they used to see that it's in a human being to want you know fellowship so even those four folks out there in the world they want to go to the ball game and they want to be together they just don't want to you know be shut up in the house and watching the ball game they want a fellowship amen so it's in us to do that but god satan meets them there give them the joy that the pledges of the world they do things they meant to get in the spirit of the world and but that's all they have the pledges of sin for season but god amen when the people of god come together they make god promise our being to miss so it's very important that we not give up on god he says he says that um now we beseech your brethren by the coming of the lord and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon that second thessalonians two and two that you may not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word not by letter as from us as that day of christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for except for that day shall not come except there be a what falling away first it's not only a falling away from coming to church it's a falling away from the word of god people don't want to live the word they don't want to obey the word anymore so they're some folks that come to church but they won't obey when god said come and be glad when you come they don't come glad they come saying so that's a you know when we come and do what god says then that's where the blessings fall but we when we battle and we're doing everything we can do to get there and when we get there we about wow after we get there but when he says you know coming for his uh courts with praises and with thanksgiving energy scopes with you know praise and when we come with that kind of mind the whole atmosphere is illuminated by your but by your attitude you know the atmosphere is so illuminated so things begin to happen for you amen not happening over there you know you know the the crowd can get electrified if one person is enthused you know what i'm saying the whole the whole audience gets electrified by one person being excited about jesus one person just happy to be saved then it left the whole crowd it don't take a whole lot of people to be glad to be in the house of the lord just take one when you got one that's glad to be there amen it can be a hundred the struggling but when one is glad it can strengthen everybody and that's what i was dealing with i might well i didn't want to get into it the day when i was out and just praying and meditating on the lord and i and i said you know when all israel was afraid everybody was afraid in israel it didn't take but one little young boy when they were faced with the the giant that got everybody scared it didn't take but one little boy that didn't even know how to fight like all those trained soldiers one little boy just heard goliath and heard his threats but this one little boy all he had was a slain and five stones but he wasn't you know it's something about when you david said that word have i hid in my heart that i might know what see is something about having that word and you see me i'm out here just enjoying you know lord you know showing me things like that i didn't want to get inside and get into it because i was trying to save it this sunday you know but you know how that is sometimes you don't share a thing and it goes by but by the grace of god don't give up everybody in israel had given up nobody was able to fight nobody i'm gonna tell you brothers and sisters i don't know about situations in your life i mean all israel trained men warriors but this person you might look like you the least of everybody in here everybody that's listening in you might look like the least of all but have you ever been in contact with god and god that has done something for you in your life if god ever moved in your life and saved you you know you're saved and god is healed and you know you're healed if god is blessed and you know you're blessed praise god when god has done those things for you amen praise god no devil in hell gonna take my blessings away praise god i'm standing on the promises of god amen praise god i know god promised cannot fail oh oh i don't care about the holland all those so other things but god is god i believe david had some experience amen that's why he didn't give up when all of israel had given up all the valid men the king and oh god but he didn't give up amen you know i look at people and they they they they know that they'll they giving up on god to listen to the devil lie and the devil destroying their lives already got it all fixed for you that i'm gonna make you oh god and you think amen did you got it in control and you gonna do this and you're gonna do that and you're big and you're bad and you're tough and you're up but the devil amen got a plan for you the devil knows when he gonna take you out so you might as well you know you you got to say god have mercy on me if you know how many demons are waiting to uh you know take you under amen if you know how many devils are hiding out there to kill you destroy you well see folk think uh you know because they can't see the devil like that but you know it's something about mama and daddy they're looking at the demons and the devils amen that they seek to destroy you they know it out there because they don't experience some things praise god and sometimes god has to open your eyes because they know what the devil will do to you some some of us men whoop a little bit praise god the devil has you know it wasn't with god mercy we would have been destroyed amen god mercy amen he's been merciful to us amen let us come to the house of the lord and be a christian and be saved it will become the mercy of the lord amen if it wasn't for his mercy we wouldn't be here we wouldn't be saved praise god the devil would have took us out why because we were foolish and thinking fools thoughts thinking that we had it all under control but thank god thank god he says i'll fall in the way first it's a falling away brother sister y'all understand that let us just bow for a minute father in jesus name i thank you lord you
