it's been kind of faith for coming in amen we thank God for all of you that have come today and all of you that are listening in Matthew 25 and 5 why the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and sleep well and then midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those words and rose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said to the wise give us of you all for our lamps are going out the wise answered saying not so least there'll be not enough for us in you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself why they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut and the doctor came also other virgins saying Lord open Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you're not watch therefore that you know for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh the godless to renew his word you may be seated we thank God for amen this day we are talking about again and again and again you've heard the message midnight cry if there had ever been a time that we would look at World War 1 and World War 2 and they started talking about when they bombs were dropped in Japan and so forth that it was three minutes to midnight but years have passed and yet seemeth Oh amen the end of all things have not come as of yet but if they could say then the sixth is that it was three minutes to midnight then our I say in 2020 I said we must be past midnight I said midnight I should have passed a long time ago and at midnight it's past and where are we and when we talk about the midnight we're talking about the end and the consummation of all things all things have come to his final destiny and everything it's come to the midnight signifies they meant that the day is passed thus midnight is speaking to us concerning I cried being me the card that was being made it was the coming of the Lord that the bridegroom is coming you and I brought our knuckles san dimas' expecting the bridegroom will expected that the bridegroom the Lord Jesus is coming soon and it will expect to Jesus to come soon then we must not give up but we must prepare for the coming as it was in the Jewish disposition so it is in the Gentile disposition God in my few 3 and 1 it says that in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand we're saying that the rapture in the coming of the Lord is at hand that's a good sound and that's what's saying to you that is an expectation for the Lord to come but the foolish it was enough they were brothers sisters we can't be halfway Christian [Music] I'm saying brothers and sisters to happen but to cry here in to the Jews was the force of one crying in the wilderness for he said in the third verse for this is he that was spoken by the Prophet is there özil the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his paths straight that must be a voice to go forward to get the bride ready for the bride rule the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever John wasn't a Pharisee he wasn't a Sadducee but he came out of the wilderness he wasn't no channel for he did not dress with the fine rules he didn't even have a church building but he had [Music] [Music] it was a message of repentance it was a message that we need to repent I believe there's always a cry of repentance when it stays away from God when man get off the street now I believe God always send somebody to cry out to church we got to get back and God will send a word it said my brothers you got to get back you see where God is I believe church on and not be just an ordinary thing people of God or to not be he meant just folks that talk to talk he meant that the folks are come and walk the walk they ought to come with the line that worthy of the gospel but but I want to God God to the world hallelujah and the Jewish disposition God took the stage and he told the king does not love for you to have your brother's wife and he got his head cut off brother sister are you willing to take a stand it was midnight to them the Jews did not know that they they just don't understand that is come and which they were praying for they were looking for what is it brother sister what is it friends of mine we got to recognize us the Lord what's going on why are we now that we haven't needed it people that need to such deep within themselves an order recognize what is going on in my life I said I've answered the call I'm hired to cry but my life the power don't Norton the spirit when you declared that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils brother sister where is God's power why is God's Spirit in yo life in the Vegas are you just cited for that in about God talking about what he was and what is will be but it's got riddle in you get the power of God in your life is that power in the night side of - oh brother sister yes you wanna god it's real what you want really somebody else later in the preacher maybe an evangelist but it's gotten real to you I said in midnight if this world it's coming to his here then that must be a church that's without spot without wrinkle what I believe is is that must be a church they make that John it summons the spirit of Elijah have summers that I'm calling the people back to God back to the world to get in line with the word come Oh somebody gotta get in each step Amen is the fight I believe will come numb we're satisfied will satisfy with God I bet somewhere but are you please are you really satisfied with the working of the Spirit in your life this is practice real to you do you really have to fire the John said after me was coming who go back to are you with the Holy Ghost and with fire there's a fire I wouldn't do a heart of gold take a fire burning they're the holy ghost burning in you yes there I desire for God to use you God I know you real God I know you here but what is going on brother sister too many of us have been satisfied lead back we haven't been responding to the word we believe that God is exist and he's to be worship but God did that the people are looking for maybe it's just a tradition maybe is just a same but the God that's with us promise that I
