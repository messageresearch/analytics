[45:42] he says here the 29th verse
[45:47] for whom he did what
[45:50] amen as the prophet said he took a
[45:53] picture of you
[45:55] so he saw you there he saw you as a gene
[45:59] he saw you at the
[46:00] thought he saw he has an attribute in
[46:01] the mind of god
[46:04] he also did what
[46:08] he predestinated because he knew that
[46:10] one day you would come into decision
[46:12] making time you'll come into this world
[46:15] and you will have a choice to make
[46:17] and god predestinated you because he
[46:20] knew what church
[46:21] you would make he saw your choice he
[46:24] knew the end from the beginning
[46:26] he saw you making the right decision
[46:30] amen i'm going to tell you something the
[46:33] devil will
[46:34] bombard your mind and play tricks on you
[46:36] and
[46:37] have you thinking all kind of crazy
[46:39] stuff and
[46:40] amen sometimes you think am i worthy
[46:43] but who is worthy
[46:51] the prophet said our first birth was an
[46:54] adultered birth we came forth
[46:56] in sin are you open
[47:00] because of what eve did in the beginning
[47:02] amen we came forth born in sin shaping
[47:05] in what
[47:06] shaping in the nicotine isn't that right
[47:09] so there was nobody that was born right
[47:11] everybody was born wrong he that is born
[47:14] of a woman is a few days full of trouble
[47:16] amen
[47:18] so we cannot lay hold on uh i am a
[47:21] simmons i am a good time of that that
[47:23] don't mean nothing you were born in sin
[47:25] you're just a sinner
[47:27] are you a man and without amen
[47:31] you couldn't do you said i had nothing
[47:32] to do with that you had nothing to do
[47:34] with it that's the way you were born
[47:37] but we have something to do with getting
[47:40] out of it now
[47:42] amen jesus made a way for you that you
[47:44] can be born
[47:45] again are you with me
[47:48] so if jesus provided a way out then you
[47:51] need to take advantage of jesus
[47:53] amen that call you
[47:57] that chose you amen you don't have to
[48:00] steal sinner
[48:02] now you mind mind you as many people
[48:05] that
[48:05] are churchgoers and many people that say
[48:08] i'm saved
[48:09] amen many people that say i'm bribed
[48:11] many people are saying
[48:13] i'm this and i'm that that's just a talk
[48:17] but it's got to go something deep it's
[48:19] got to be a revelation to you
[48:22] amen cain might have thought he had it
[48:24] all together but
[48:25] his sacrifice was not accepted
[48:29] amen because he didn't have a revelation
[48:33] brother sister you must have a
[48:35] revelation of who you are
[48:38] you must have a revelation by faith amen
[48:41] praise god your faith amen it just can't
[48:45] be amen
[48:46] i'm just going through the motion you

[48:53] you are part of him
[48:56] are you with me i'm more than just a
[48:59] church girl i'm you're
[49:00] more than just somebody that's been
[49:02] baptized in water
[49:03] i'm more oh god
[49:08] see because many times amen
[49:11] we latch onto things but we're never
[49:14] able to manifest
[49:17] amen it's something amen that you cannot
[49:21] you know you cannot fake this
[49:24] there are a lot of hypocrites
[49:28] amen there's a lot of crows
[49:31] are you with me there are a lot of folk
[49:33] that say i'm holy but they're not holy
[49:36] amen the only way we you and i are going
[49:39] to be holy
[49:40] is because the holy god has come down
[49:43] and tearing knocking in us
[49:46] oh wait a minute oh
[49:51] i'm getting ahead of myself but i got to
[49:53] go ahead on him
[49:54] he says for whom he did
[49:57] for no he also did predestinate to be
[50:00] conformed
[50:02] unto the image of his son
[50:05] there's no use in us trying to be like
[50:07] somebody else
[50:09] he to be conformed in the image of his
[50:12] son
[50:14] sometimes we ask the question what would
[50:15] jesus do
[50:18] what would jesus do in situations in
[50:20] life
[50:23] because he has predestinated us to be
[50:26] conformed to the image of his son
[50:30] do you see your life becoming more and
[50:32] more like jesus
[50:35] are you satisfied with just being who
[50:37] you are
[50:40] but god wants to conform you into his
[50:42] image
[50:44] amen you want you to be like him
[50:50] somebody said to be like jesus oh how
[50:52] alone
[50:54] to be like him so meek and lowly
[50:58] so armored and holy you know i thought
[51:01] about people don't

[51:04] that sacredness
[51:06] about christians anymore amen
[51:10] that's not that holy hush
[51:13] about christians anymore people look
[51:16] like they are satisfied
[51:18] amen with the worldliness
[51:22] they let the world creep in anything the
[51:24] world is doing the church
[51:25] feel like i can do it but i'm going to
[51:27] do it in a holy way
[51:30] amen oh yes we can do it
[51:34] the holy way amen the
[51:37] instead of the the standard of holiness

[51:44] lost their
[51:45] uh spiritual minds
[51:49] amen well that's not spiritual they
[51:52] meant
[51:52] uh uh you think preachers ought to be
[51:55] spiritual you think
[51:56] people ought to be uh but their holiness
[51:59] and the righteousness
[52:00] and the pureness of holiness people
[52:03] don't even
[52:04] understand it so how can god
[52:07] vindicate how can god come down in
[52:09] supernatural ways
[52:11] amen and do supernatural things when the
[52:13] people are so worthy
[52:15] amen sense lost his hair
[52:20] are you with me
[52:24] people are losing amen the holiness

[53:02] purpose you're called according to his
[53:07] purpose god got a purpose and a standard
[53:12] amen don't lower your standards
[53:16] don't give in to the world
[53:19] hallelujah it's something about the
[53:22] beauty of holiness
[53:24] god have mercy amen if god called us to
[53:27] be holy
[53:28] amen he said for those calls i sanctify
[53:31] myself

[54:22] are not my ways
[54:23] but your thoughts are not my thoughts
[54:26] god takes the lords
[54:30] oh god it said predestinated according
[54:34] to the image
[54:35] of his conformed to the image of his son
[54:38] that you might be
[54:39] the first mourn of many brethren more of
[54:42] whom he did predestinate them he also
[54:44] called
[54:44] and whom he called then he also
[54:46] justified whom he justified them he also
[54:49] glorified
[54:51] what shall we say then to these things

[1:08:30] there's a lot of characters in the bible
[1:08:32] that
[1:08:33] you can look at but he said it's god
[1:08:35] that justifies
[1:08:39] it no matter how many times i tell the
[1:08:41] story of the different ones
[1:08:43] you know who would choose to holler like

[1:08:50] your holo that means you're out of it
[1:08:52] you know most of us are saying
[1:08:56] not who would choose a woman caught in
[1:08:59] the very
[1:08:59] act of adultery who would choose that
[1:09:03] kind of woman
[1:09:04] who would allow this woman that has been
[1:09:06] prostituting herself
[1:09:07] to put this precious ointment on my feet
[1:09:10] and
[1:09:10] wipe my own jesus
[1:09:15] doesn't he do he do things that
[1:09:18] beyond our comprehension of
[1:09:20] understanding
[1:09:21] but yet we are so ready
[1:09:26] to reject somebody if they just look
[1:09:29] like they look at us the wrong way
[1:09:33] we make a decision in our mind if
[1:09:35] somebody wronged
[1:09:36] us one time
[1:09:40] you would never be a joseph that could
[1:09:42] forgive your brother

[1:10:04] a christian to do certain things

[1:10:10] bring you into your
[1:10:11] position into your place
[1:10:14] and the only way he can do that is he's
[1:10:16] got to stop you long enough to see

[1:19:01] to my conclusion in revelation
[1:19:06] 19.

[1:19:19] churches but there's
[1:19:20] only one bride

[1:19:34] god has chosen you to be that elected
[1:19:36] lady
[1:19:42] i can't i'll tell you something
[1:19:46] i've been tempted i know we've been
[1:19:50] tried
[1:19:51] and tested
[1:19:55] something about what he's done for me
[1:20:03] you it's been many disappointments in
[1:20:07] life
[1:20:10] many times the devil had come and said
[1:20:13] give up
[1:20:18] you know it's a constant battle just to
[1:20:20] stand in the pulpit sometimes
[1:20:25] because we're living in a terrible time
[1:20:28] with people
[1:20:30] the bible said they take to themselves
[1:20:32] teaching having itchiness
[1:20:35] men will love pleasure more than god
[1:20:39] they're trying to make the church a
[1:20:41] place of entertainment
[1:20:47] when you're having contests and this and
[1:20:49] contests and that
[1:20:51] and who's going to shine the brightest
[1:20:55] they're making the church
[1:20:58] who can shout the best of
[1:21:02] dance the best who can oh god
[1:21:08] and it's creeping into the
[1:21:12] god word promised word for the hour
[1:21:15] and people are accepting it because
[1:21:19] they think that they got to they got to
[1:21:22] conform to the world
[1:21:26] all the jokes and all the playing around
[1:21:28] and all the justin and
[1:21:30] all the craziness is going on out there
[1:21:33] people are saying come on
[1:21:36] amen we're trying to do everything to
[1:21:39] hold the young people
[1:21:40] and the young people are backsliding
[1:21:45] but it's that old-time holy ghost
[1:21:48] that old-time holy ghost with people
[1:21:50] have cried long enough
[1:21:52] but listen to the prophets some folks
[1:21:54] won't stay long enough to get the
[1:21:56] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:59] you need the baptism in the holy ghost
[1:22:00] that's the only thing going to keep you
[1:22:04] i don't care what you do in the church i
[1:22:06] don't care what kind of
[1:22:07] uh programs and what kind of things you
[1:22:09] put on in the church
[1:22:10] the only thing going to keep them is the
[1:22:11] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:14] if they don't get the holy ghost i don't
[1:22:16] care what you do to try to please them
[1:22:18] they go on anyhow
[1:22:20] or you have a worldly church people
[1:22:22] putting on a show
[1:22:25] yes something about getting
[1:22:29] the giving not just gifts
[1:22:32] so people who want to experience the
[1:22:34] gifts but not to give them
[1:22:39] i've heard hearing the prophet of god
[1:22:40] says that's what the people want to give
[1:22:43] the gifts to be in the church but
[1:22:46] forgetting about the giver are you with
[1:22:49] me
[1:22:51] i think we're more interested in the
[1:22:52] gifts than we're interested in together
[1:22:56] we need him we need jesus in us
[1:23:01] we need jesus now if it ever been a time
[1:23:05] when the church
[1:23:07] i'm going to talk about are people
[1:23:09] afraid to stand by themselves
[1:23:12] but brother and sister it's a lonely
[1:23:14] road in this hour
[1:23:18] it's a lonely road in this hour i'm
[1:23:21] talking individually it's a lonely road
[1:23:25] if you got somebody that's standing with
[1:23:27] you and trying to hold
[1:23:28] a standard then thank god for you
[1:23:32] brother sister
[1:23:34] if you got somebody that's trying to
[1:23:36] live a godly life
[1:23:37] and holding to the word thank god for
[1:23:41] you brother sister
[1:23:43] because there's not many people are
[1:23:46] slipping in their slides
[1:23:49] and they don't seem to even care anymore
[1:23:53] they don't seem to care
[1:23:58] preachers are saying i used to stand for
[1:24:00] this and i used to stand for that
[1:24:02] but i find out i got a new revelation
[1:24:09] and sometimes they try to brother
[1:24:10] simmons i said
[1:24:12] you know you're not going to bring that
[1:24:13] by me
[1:24:17] go do what you want to do at the end of
[1:24:20] the road
[1:24:21] god got to finally say song are you with
[1:24:25] me
[1:24:26] but i wonder how many are going to stand
[1:24:29] how many
[1:24:30] is going to really take a stand for god
[1:24:34] it's too many things and i can't bring
[1:24:36] them
[1:24:39] on the air see
[1:24:44] sometimes we have to cut it off and talk
[1:24:47] to you a little bit
[1:24:49] but you got to get desperate you got to
[1:24:52] get out on your knees and say god
[1:24:54] whether or not you mean business with
[1:24:55] god or not
[1:24:59] that god can't bless you with what you
[1:25:00] need then
[1:25:03] don't worry about it don't try to get
[1:25:06] something god don't want you to have
[1:25:09] are you with me and if you're not
[1:25:12] willing to give up what
[1:25:16] these things that's going to hinder you
[1:25:19] from being a christian
[1:25:20] for god if you're not willing to give
[1:25:23] them up
[1:25:23] then you love them more than you love
[1:25:25] god
[1:25:27] and if you love the world more than you
[1:25:28] love god then the love of the father is
[1:25:30] not in you
[1:25:32] brother and sister people say brother
[1:25:35] simmons
[1:25:36] i believe you to believe and not
[1:25:40] do is faith without works
[1:25:44] is dead brother and sister it's no
