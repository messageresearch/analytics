[36:40] Um, second Peter
[36:44] 1,
[36:51] let's start at 10-2.
[36:56] Wherefore the rather, brethren,
[37:00] gave our diligence to make your calling
[37:02] and your election sure. For if you do
[37:05] these things, you shall never fall.
[37:10] For so an entrance shall be ministered
[37:12] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[37:15] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[37:18] Christ.
[37:20] Wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[37:23] you always in remembrance of these
[37:26] things though you know them and be
[37:29] established in the present truth. Let us
[37:34] pray. Father Lord we thank you for your
[37:38] grace and Lord for your mercy. God we
[37:42] pray that you bless thy word in Jesus
[37:45] name. Amen. may
[37:48] be seated.
[37:52] Also, if you'll turn with me to the book
[37:54] of Ephesians,
[37:58] the book of Ephesians,
[38:02] the um 4th chapter,
[38:21] let's 3 11-15.
[38:29] Ephesians 4:11-5.
[38:31] And he gave some apostles
[38:34] and some prophets and some evangelists
[38:37] and some pastors and teachers,
[38:42] for the perfecting of the saints,
[38:45] for the work of the ministry, for the
[38:48] edifying of the body of Christ. Do we
[38:51] all come into the unity of defaith and
[38:55] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[38:58] a perfect man, unto the measure of the
[39:02] stature of the fullness of Christ,
[39:06] that we henceforth be no more children,
[39:10] tossed to and fro, and carried about
[39:13] with every wind of doctrine, but by the
[39:16] slight of men and cunning craftiness,
[39:20] whereby their lie and wait to deceive,
[39:23] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[39:26] up into him in all things which is the
[39:30] head, even Christ. Amen.
[39:36] Go back to Peter
[39:39] tonight, second Peter. And that's where
[39:41] I want to draw my thought from tonight.
[39:44] Amen. And that's God
[39:47] establishing his church.
[39:51] God establishing
[39:54] his church.
[39:57] I looked up the
[40:00] word establishing. This is I was
[40:04] um looking at in time. Like it failed me
[40:07] back there, but I didn't hear um where
[40:10] y'all were in the services. But I looked
[40:12] up the word establish
[40:16] and just to give you some where I'm
[40:18] looking to be going by the grace of God
[40:23] and several definition but I like what I
[40:26] saw is it means to to be firmly
[40:32] rooted
[40:33] stable
[40:35] and grounded
[40:38] in faith
[40:40] truth truth and God's love
[40:43] making one unshakable
[40:46] in the face of challenges.
[40:51] I like that.
[40:54] Unshakable
[40:55] in the face of challenges.
[41:00] Establish.
[41:02] None of you noticed this that
[41:06] especially when it comes to the church
[41:08] world.
[41:10] Man has tried to
[41:14] make God church
[41:16] or try to establish what they think God
[41:21] want the church to be established upon.
[41:26] And no doubt I believe their intentions
[41:29] are good.
[41:32] Some of the things that they are
[41:33] instituting
[41:35] is it's real good.
[41:38] But
[41:40] it's not what God the way that God
[41:43] wanted to be built and established upon.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; God never wanted his church to be
[41:49] established upon man ideas. That's
[41:53] &gt;&gt; true. Amen.
[41:55] especially when it come to organization
[41:58] denominational systems.
[42:01] Now though those things may be good and
[42:04] we appreciate you know the people you
[42:08] know taking the initiative at least to
[42:10] try
[42:13] to establish something
[42:15] in a way that they want to see the
[42:19] people come to some kind of place of
[42:23] settlement.
[42:27] And in this hour uh especially
[42:32] and also as we notice even all down
[42:34] through the church ages and the history
[42:36] of the church, we saw that how that
[42:40] first church Ephesus
[42:44] which mean aim at and relax who started
[42:47] out
[42:49] Paul being that messenger
[42:55] and Paul
[42:57] after being converted, I like that
[43:01] Paul at one time was trying to establish
[43:04] the church himself.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't according to the way that
[43:10] God
[43:12] intend for it to be.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Was Paul sincere? Yes, sir.
[43:20] He was very zealous
[43:23] to carry out what he thought that God
[43:28] wanted
[43:31] to do for the church.
[43:35] But instead of doing that, he was
[43:37] actually persecuting
[43:40] &gt;&gt; the very church. Amen.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz you see how man can have good
[43:45] intention, be sincere, but can be
[43:48] sincerely wrong.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Not saying what he wasn't doing wasn't
[43:53] good because at the time that was his
[43:56] understanding.
[44:00] But when he met God, when he met Jesus,
[44:05] &gt;&gt; IT ALWAYS BRING ABOUT A difference when
[44:08] you meet the author and the finisher. Go
[44:11] ahead.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; See,
[44:16] &gt;&gt; and I BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON, every
[44:20] minister
[44:23] MUST MEET THAT SAME PERSON
[44:27] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO BE
[44:29] effectively established,
[44:32] grounded, ROOTED
[44:35] &gt;&gt; IN PRESENT DAY TRUTH.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; UHHUH.
[44:44] IN OTHER WORDS, WE WANT TO BRING GOD OUT
[44:48] OF HISTORY.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; AND WE WANT TO MAKE THAT GOD SO VISIBLE,
[44:57] SO VISIBLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN
[45:00] TOUCH HIM TOO.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; EACH INDIVIDUAL. YES.
[45:12] OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO COME IN contact
[45:18] with the living Jesus Christ themselves.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; BUT THE WAY THAT HAS TO BEEN, IT HAS TO
[45:27] BE GOD PROVIDED WAY FOR THEM.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible SAID THERE'S A WAY THAT SEEMTH
[45:34] RIGHT.
[45:37] IT SEEMS GOOD TO BUILD SCHOOLS,
[45:42] to build uh apartments and all of these
[45:46] things for the people to have, BUT
[45:48] THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD IS ESTABLISHING HIS
[45:52] CHURCH ON.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Neither is it education,
[45:57] &gt;&gt; seminary teaching. GO AHEAD.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN WORD.
[46:06] IT HAS TO BE THE WORD THAT GOD PURPOSELY
[46:10] SENDS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THAT PARTICULAR
[46:15] GENERATION.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; CUZ IF NOT, THE PEOPLE BE LIVING IN THE
[46:20] GLARE OF ANOTHER TIME.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; THEY'LL STILL BE TRYING TO BUILD AN ARC.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT HAS THAT'S HISTORY.
[46:34] AND IT WAS THE TRUTH,
[46:38] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT PRESENT TRUTH.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; IT IS. IT WAS WHAT GOD USED FOR THAT
[46:48] PARTICULAR TIME. GOD HAS SEASONS
[46:54] AND HE HAS A PURPOSE
[46:58] AND HE WANTS TO GET A PEOPLE.
[47:03] Let me read something right. Book of
[47:05] Deuteronomy.
[47:10] Amen.
[47:16] Deuteronomy 28.
[47:39] 289.
[47:47] The Lord shall establish thee in holy
[47:52] people unto himself,
[47:56] as he has sworn unto thee. If thou
[47:59] should keep the commandments of the Lord
[48:02] thy God, and walk in his ways. See, God
[48:08] is going to establish thee. How does he
[48:11] do it? Through the word.
[48:16] But now that word of God,
[48:22] IT HAS TO HAVE SUCH an effect
[48:29] upon the people
[48:32] TO BE ABLE TO BRING THEM BACK
[48:37] to a place
[48:40] THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RESTORED
[48:42] BACK TO the original
[48:46] faith.
[48:50] That was one of the REASON WHY GOD SENT
[48:53] the Elijah this day
[48:58] TO TURN OUR HEARTS back
[49:04] and Lord knows it was needed.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] BECAUSE THE CHURCH WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
[49:12] HAS DONE ESTABLISHED ALL KIND OF things
[49:17] &gt;&gt; off the word
[49:20] AND TRYING TO BRING THE PEOPLE INTO A
[49:23] system
[49:25] of organizing
[49:27] religious
[49:30] BUT GOD COULD NOT PUT HIS approval
[49:34] on that. HE USED IT FOR A PARTICULAR
[49:37] TIME.
[49:39] BUT REMEMBER, GOD WAS STILL
[49:44] uh uh restoring and bringing TO PEOPLE
[49:47] TO A PLACE
[49:50] THAT THEY FULL ATTENTION WOULD BE BACK
[49:53] ON HIM.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing else. UH-HUH.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; NOT ON ANY BISHOP OR ANY CERTAIN CHURCH
[50:03] OR ANY CERTAIN DOCTRINE, BUT BACK TO
[50:07] HIMSELF.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT, HE HAD TO
[50:14] restore
[50:16] the truth of God's word.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE RAISES UP A PERSON TO GIVE
[50:23] HIM A PARTICULAR WORD FOR THE PEOPLE
[50:27] THAT ARE LIVING IN THAT PARTICULAR
[50:30] GENERATION.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:33] AND THEN WHEN THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO HEAR
[50:35] THAT VOICE,
[50:37] NOT A VOICE OF A MAN, BUT IT WAS A VERY
[50:40] VOICE OF GOD.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; AND TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT IT'S A VOICE
[50:45] OF GOD BECAUSE HE SAID THAT MY SHEEP.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; YES.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; WILL HEAR MY VOICE.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; OH, come on.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; SHEEPS ONLY LISTEN TO THE GREAT
[51:00] SHEPHERD.
[51:01] AMEN.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY KNOW THE VOICE? BECAUSE WHEN
[51:05] THEY HEAR IT, IT DOES SOMETHING FOR
[51:08] THEM.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; IT RAN THEM AWAY FROM ANYBODY'S TRYING
[51:13] TO DICTATE TO THEM ANYTHING OTHER THAN
[51:17] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, NO OTHER NAME GIVEN AMONG MEN
[51:23] WHEREBY WE MUST BE SAVED BY.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY MIGHT BE GREAT MEN, BUT THEY
[51:29] THEY THEY DID, BUT IT WAS ONLY GOD'S
[51:32] VOICE TO THE PEOPLE.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And when they hear it, they can come to
[51:37] it.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] I'm really excited
[51:49] to see how God and what he has been
[51:52] doing over all thousands of years
[51:56] bringing the people to a place
[52:00] that way they won't be as Paul said
[52:03] children toss to and fro with every win
[52:07] of doctrine. Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[52:12] WE WON'T BE EASY TO RUN HERE AND RUN
[52:16] THERE BECAUSE OF GREAT MEN AND
[52:20] PERSONALITIES and deep things and all.
[52:23] No, NO, NO, NO, NO. HIS VOICE.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[52:31] GOD ESTABLISHED THE CHURCH.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD BECAUSE IF IT'S GOD CHURCH
[52:40] THEN HE HAS TO ESTABLISH UPON HIMSELF.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; OH YES.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; SO THE WORD OF GOD HAS TO BE RESTORED
[52:48] BACK IN ORDER FOR THE PEOPLE TO KNOW
[52:52] THAT IT'S GOD OR NOT.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; AND THEN GOD BEGIN TO VINDICATE THAT
[52:57] WORD. UH-HUH.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[53:00] &gt;&gt; HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE PEOPLE BY
[53:04] SUPERNATURAL
[53:05] SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT THIS IS THUS
[53:08] SAYETH THE LORD.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL NOT VINDICATE A LIE.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; HOW GOOD IT IS, NO MATTER WHAT YOU
[53:16] BUILD, WHAT EMPIRE, ALL THAT YOU DID, IF
[53:20] THE SUPERNATURAL VINDICATION DON'T
[53:23] FOLLOW IT, IT'S NOT OF GOD.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[53:31] LORD, help us
[53:34] to understand
[53:37] especially in this hour that we live in.
[53:41] That's hard to get the people to be
[53:43] stable
[53:46] to understand
[53:48] the purpose of God for your particular
[53:50] life.
[53:52] Cuz there's so many voices,
[53:55] uncertain sounds.
[53:58] And Paul said, "How many men had crept
[54:00] in unaware."
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Drawing the people away.
[54:06] See, and anytime any teaching or any
[54:11] preaching takes the people away from the
[54:14] word,
[54:16] that's not of God.
[54:20] WE SHOULD NOT
[54:22] BRING THE PEOPLE TO US,
[54:26] POINT THEM TO ANY KIND OF MAN IDEAS
[54:31] MINISTRIES.
[54:33] Our focus AT THE FAR MINISTRY IS TO
[54:36] BRING THE PEOPLE BACK TO GOD AGAIN.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR FOCUS. NOT THIS, NOT THAT,
[54:44] BUT JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; BACK TO THE WORD, BACK TO GOD, BACK TO
[54:51] THE SUPERNATURAL, BACK TO THE SIGNS AND
[54:54] WONDERS, BACK TO LIVING A LIFE.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; That's what the early church did. Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; So regard that early church in the book
[55:08] of Acts,
[55:12] they were first established
[55:16] in the book of Acts on the day of
[55:18] Pentecost.
[55:20] We all knew what happened in the dark
[55:22] ages of history.
[55:25] How been Paul started out with the true
[55:27] word and as the time get along then the
[55:30] word almost got blacked out.
[55:33] The antichrist spirit, the false
[55:35] prophets, the false apostles came in
[55:40] until it got so bad to where they
[55:42] actually
[55:44] it was a spiritual blackout.
[55:47] took the Bibles from the people,
[55:50] established them up into some man-made
[55:53] creeds and dogmas,
[55:57] but yet God had a little light there
[55:59] still.
[56:02] And when that light come, then God
[56:04] expect for the people to walk in the
[56:06] light.
[56:09] And in this age, we know that it was
[56:11] completely blackout.
[56:14] And God raised up the servant of God to
[56:16] put a little light there in this age
[56:21] because God WAS GOING TO ESTABLISH HIS
[56:24] church again.
[56:26] God was going to have a people that that
[56:28] that was GOING TO RETURN BACK TO THE
[56:31] word again.
[56:33] He was going to bring them to a PLACE OF
[56:36] OF NOT BEING CONFUSED ABOUT whether they
[56:39] save or not.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's terrible when Christian
[56:45] CHURCH FOLKS DON'T KNOW FROM ONE WEEK TO
[56:47] THE NEXT WHETHER I'M SAVED OR WHETHER
[56:49] I'M NOT.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And when you GET ON A STABLE LIKE THAT,
[56:54] YOU NEED TO FIND SOME PLACE THE WAY YOU
[56:58] CAN GET SETTLED.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Even all this truth that we have, we we
[57:06] still having problem with that.
[57:09] of people getting stable.
[57:13] IT'S BECAUSE THEY THEY TAKING THEIR REAL
[57:16] FOCUS OFF of the word.
[57:21] PAUL, IF YOU SAY, "FOLLOW ME, THOU
[57:24] FOLLOW CHRIST."
[57:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:27] HE WAS POINTING THE PEOPLE BACK TO JESUS
[57:31] CHRIST. AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE
[57:32] DOING.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; TO BE ABLE TO GET THE people settled.
[57:38] LET'S POINT THE PEOPLE TO CHRIST, THE
[57:42] WORD.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; LET'S NOT PUT MAN ABOVE THE WORD,
[57:49] BUT LET'S PUT THE WORD ABOVE THE MAN.
[57:52] AMEN.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; LORD, help us
[58:02] &gt;&gt; to be established,
[58:05] rooted
[58:08] firmly.
[58:10] Why? Because you're going to have
[58:12] challenges.
[58:15] You're going to meet things that going
[58:17] to come against your very life.
[58:23] And you're going to have TO KNOW WHERE
[58:25] YOU STAND.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; You going to have to KNOW WHETHER OR NOT
[58:29] YOU GOT THE GOODS or not.
[58:34] And I find THAT WHEN PEOPLE NOT SURE and
[58:37] then when these CHALLENGES COME OF LIFE,
[58:40] THEY GET QUICKER WANT to run away. Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Then they feel if they be in a different
[58:47] place that they are more spiritual then
[58:50] no you are not
[58:53] cuz IF YOU WERE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
[58:56] SETTLED WHERE YOU WERE AT.
[59:00] YOU WE NEED AN ANCHOR.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT ABOUT WE HOLDING IT BUT
[59:06] SOMETHING THAT IS HOLDING YOU.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. CUZ IN THIS FLESH, WE KNOW WE GET
[59:14] WEAK AND WEARY.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING TO BE
[59:18] ABLE TO TO HOLD YOU.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; AND TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU
[59:23] &gt;&gt; AND TO KEEP YOU SOBER MINDED
[59:25] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON REGARDING
[59:28] WHAT COMES,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU FACE, YOU CAN
[59:31] SAY, "I'M STANDING ON THE WORD.
[59:36] REGARDLESS WHO LEAVES, WHO COMES, I'M
[59:39] STANDING ON ONE PRINCIPLE
[59:41] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE WORD.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. I DON'T KNOW
[59:45] ABOUT THAT. BUT I KNOW ONE THING FOR
[59:47] SURE. GOD WORD IS RIGHT.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PERSONALITIES.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, BROTHER. You meet a
[1:00:01] lot of people and talk about a lot of
[1:00:02] things. I said, I can't v for none of
[1:00:05] that.
[1:00:06] I stay with this.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; I don't see what you talking about sin,
[1:00:12] brother and sister. I ain't You know
[1:00:14] what I'm saying? But I want to stay with
[1:00:16] what I know is right.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:00:22] we ought not to be
[1:00:25] and thank God to see people that are
[1:00:27] settle minded,
[1:00:29] sober,
[1:00:32] regardless of what people think they got
[1:00:34] going on.
[1:00:36] I have one agenda
[1:00:39] and that's staying with Christ.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Staying with the word.
[1:00:47] That's what the early church did. They
[1:00:49] had to face things.
[1:00:51] THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH SITUATION.
[1:00:54] BUT BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY
[1:00:57] GHOST,
[1:00:59] THE HOLY GHOST IS THE ONLY THING THAT
[1:01:02] CAN establish you.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Let me say THAT AGAIN. THAT'S WHY IT'S
[1:01:08] URGENT. I thought about preaching
[1:01:11] urgency.

[1:01:17] THE HOLY GHOST NOW.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE YOUNG PEOPLE, CHILDREN, old
[1:01:24] people, YOU MUST RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST
[1:01:28] NOW.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:33] thought about our young people going to
[1:01:35] school
[1:01:38] and Lord knows
[1:01:40] can't just even imagine the challenges,
[1:01:44] the influence,
[1:01:47] the pollution,
[1:01:50] the things they have to contend with.
[1:01:53] peer pressure,
[1:01:57] all the filth that goes on in the
[1:01:59] schools,
[1:02:01] and they got to contend with that. How
[1:02:05] how are you going to be able to stand if
[1:02:07] God don't help you?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever think,

[1:02:30] this way of a yes it may be a lonely
[1:02:33] walk.

[1:02:53] be with you at all times. A good friend
[1:02:56] won't won't get you involved in things
[1:02:58] that's not right.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's not a real friend to me. Go
[1:03:04] ahead.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; A real friend want me to say you don't
[1:03:07] do that.
[1:03:10] That's what real friends do.
[1:03:13] Stay away from those things.
[1:03:16] There's a lot of enticing spirits.

[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE KEEPER OF YOUR BODY.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE KEEPER. EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T
[1:05:10] FEEL YOU CAN BE KEPT, GOD WILL KEEP YOU.
[1:05:15] IN THE MIDST OF WHAT YOU'RE DEALING
[1:05:16] WITH.

[1:05:22] YOU.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO REALLY GET A HOLD OF GOD
[1:05:27] NOW. DON'T WAIT TILL TOMORROW.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; DO IT RIGHT NOW. CUZ THE LONGER YOU
[1:05:34] WAIT,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; the devil can work on you more.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; THE LONGER YOU WAIT, HIS INFLUENCE GETS
[1:05:41] STRONGER. BUT THE BIBLE SAY TODAY,

[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GET TO THIS ALTAR AND CRY OUT
[1:05:54] BEFORE GOD AND SAY, "LORD, HERE I AM."
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; I NEED SOMETHING STRONGER THAN
[1:06:01] SELF-WILL.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; WHY WAIT?
[1:06:10] What are we WAITING FOR?
[1:06:13] WHEN GOD GIVES AN INVITATION, HE SAID,
[1:06:15] "COME."
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; COME. DON'T WAIT.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; CUZ THE MINUTE YOU WAIT AND YOU GO BACK
[1:06:22] OUT, THEN THAT SPIRIT WILL GET UP OFF OF
[1:06:24] YOU.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THE HOLY GHOST IS DEALING WITH
[1:06:27] YOU, EVEN TONIGHT, DON'T WAIT. COME.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; DON'T WAIT TILL THE SUNDAY, COME DOWN.
[1:06:34] DON'T WAIT THE SATURDAY PRAYER. COME

[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I'll be THE ONE TROUBLE TONIGHT.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; I NEED SOMEBODY GOD CALLING SOMEBODY
[1:07:02] SAY, "COME GET THE HOLY GHOST TONIGHT."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:09] We done got away from the altar.
[1:07:15] We need to get back to the altar
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; and not wait for THE MAN TO CALL IT. IF
[1:07:20] GOD BRING A CONVICTION ON YOUR HEART,
[1:07:22] GET UP HERE.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; CUZ IT'S GOD CALLING YOU.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; GOD INVITING YOU. GOD LETTING YOU KNOW
[1:07:34] THIS MIGHT BE YOUR LAST TIME.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Too many time we go in and out of
[1:07:43] services. I tell the church back home.
[1:07:46] Don't wait till the next time.
[1:07:49] And when next time the devil be
[1:07:50] swiftier.
[1:07:52] But while that thing is freshly upon you
[1:07:56] now. Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; If you hear that the spirit of God
[1:08:01] talking to you, say come.
[1:08:05] Then somebody and love spirit say don't
[1:08:07] go. Don't go. But God say come.
[1:08:12] Come now.
[1:08:14] Now is the day of your visitation.
[1:08:19] SEE GOD WANT TO VISIT YOU.
[1:08:22] YOU KNOW, GOD WANTS TO VISIT YOU IN A
[1:08:27] PERSONAL WAY. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS, "CALM
[1:08:30] DOWN.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:08:35] GOING TO ESTABLISH YOU IN THE TRUTH OF
[1:08:38] MY WORD." THAT'S THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, y'all. Careers ain't going to
[1:08:50] establish you. Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You make some money, but what the
[1:08:54] trouble you have with it?
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Cars ain't going to establish you. It
[1:08:59] looks good and run good, but they still
[1:09:02] won't cast out no devils.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; BIG HOUSES IN FANCY YARDS LOOKS GOOD TO
[1:09:08] THE PUBLIC, BUT AIN'T NO DEVIL BE CAST
[1:09:11] OUT. YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT GOING TO
[1:09:12] FIGHT DEVILS.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:18] Oh my.
[1:09:21] Pray God calling somebody.
[1:09:24] I pray you hearken to the call. I DON'T
[1:09:28] CARE HOW YOUNG YOU IS. YOU'RE NOT TOO
[1:09:30] YOUNG.
[1:09:32] I DON'T CARE HOW YOUNG AREN'T TOO OLD.
[1:09:35] THE EARLIER THE BETTER.
[1:09:38] Now one of the regrets I did. I wish I
[1:09:40] WOULD HAVE COME EARLIER.
[1:09:42] BUT GOD, NO. BUT GOD IS GIVING YOU AN
[1:09:45] OPPORTUNITY. DON'T WAIT LIKE US.
[1:09:50] COME GET IT NOW.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; A lot of time. Let me tell you what the
[1:10:04] devil does.
[1:10:07] Sometime people just want to wait till
[1:10:08] somebody else to come. Don't do that.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Don't wait on them.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; This is personal.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; God call you by your own name. Each one
[1:10:21] of you, you got a name, don't you? If I
[1:10:24] say joy, there was two joys
[1:10:28] and God can talk to both joys.
[1:10:32] BUT WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS, GOD CALL YOU.
[1:10:36] THAT'S WHY EVEN WITH THIS MESSAGE OF THE
[1:10:38] HOUR, GOD MADE IT SO PERSONALIZED. HE
[1:10:42] SAID, "BEHOLD, I'M GOING TO SEND you
[1:10:44] Elijah."
[1:10:46] AND THAT'S THE WHOMVERSOEVER
[1:10:49] WILL, LET HIM COME.
[1:10:53] This is not a group thing. It's not a
[1:10:56] family relationship when it come to
[1:10:58] this, y'all.
[1:11:00] This is a personalized thing that God
[1:11:03] getting us ready for that great. Y'all
[1:11:05] see the coming of the Lord.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE THE NUCLEAR BOMBS? COME ON,
[1:11:12] BROTHERS.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, misters.
[1:11:16] THAT'S RIGHT. DON'T WAIT.
[1:11:20] DON'T WAIT ON NOBODY ELSE. YOU COME.
[1:11:25] YOU MUST GET IT NOW.
[1:11:28] IT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING DESPERATE THAT
[1:11:30] OLD AS WELL AS YOUNG. I DON'T CARE HOW
[1:11:32] OLD YOU ARE. THE SAD PART ABOUT most of
[1:11:34] the older people, one of the main one
[1:11:36] needed, they'll sit right there looking
[1:11:38] at you.
[1:11:41] Cuz oh, I ain't going to be looking BAD.
[1:11:43] LOOK BAD. YOU LOOK REAL BAD. YOU MISSED
[1:11:47] THIS RAPTURE.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; YOU TALKING ABOUT LOOKING BAD. YOU WANT
[1:11:52] TO MISS THE RAPTURE.
[1:11:55] LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU DON'T GET THE
[1:11:56] HOLY GHOST, PEOPLE,
[1:11:58] IF YOU DON'T GET THE HOLY GHOST NOW,
[1:12:02] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT WHEN UP ON
[1:12:05] US. NOW IS THE TIME TO GET IT.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; ONLY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST WILL
[1:12:12] ENTITLE YOU TO THE RAPTURE.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you want to go into
[1:12:17] the rapture.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; But then, do you have the Holy Ghost?
[1:12:22] Come on. We ought to have church service
[1:12:23] that we ought not to worry about what
[1:12:25] time,
[1:12:29] but we want people that GET DESPERATE.
[1:12:33] YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO HAVE IT.
[1:12:36] How about you, sister brother? Come on,
[1:12:39] musician.
[1:12:42] HOW ABOUT IT?
[1:12:44] LET'S HAVE ONE OF THEM NIGHTS.
[1:12:47] WE USED TO HAVE THEM, BUT I'M CALLING
[1:12:50] THEM BACK.
[1:12:54] SO WHEN THE POWER OF GOD USED TO DROP
[1:12:56] DOWN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WERE ON A ONE
[1:12:59] CAR, THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE COME TO
[1:13:02] CHURCH.
[1:13:04] NOT TO LOOK PRETTY AND IT LOOK LIKE WE
[1:13:06] GOT SOMETHING WE DON'T. BUT IF YOU DON'T
[1:13:09] HAVE IT, NOW IS THE TIME PEOPLE.
[1:13:14] Oh Lord,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, let the Holy Ghost atmosphere
[1:13:21] If you don't want to come and pray, why
[1:13:23] don't you bow your head and pray with
[1:13:24] her? If you still want to come to the
[1:13:27] altar, there's plenty OF ROOM. EVEN IN
[1:13:30] YOUR OWN SEAT, JUST GET DOWN RIGHT ON
[1:13:32] YOUR SEAT ON your knees and begin to CRY
[1:13:34] OUT, "LORD, I NEED THE HOLY GHOST
[1:13:38] TONIGHT.
[1:13:39] I NEED THE HOLY GHOST RIGHT NOW, LORD.
[1:13:43] DON'T LET ME, LORD, LEAVE OUT OF THIS

[1:14:03] HOLY GHOST TONIGHT. THIS IS OUR DAY,

[1:14:09] MY WHOLE LIFE.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; OH, SISTER, BROTHER, don't you want it?

[1:14:42] God, we want you to come and make you
[1:14:44] abide with the people. Lord God, let
[1:14:48] them know God that that you want to give
[1:14:50] them that experience,

[1:15:20] LORD, MAY YOUR PRESENCE, OH GOD, LORD,
[1:15:24] FALL DOWN, LORD, IN THIS PLACE TONIGHT,
[1:15:28] LORD, REKINDLE US, GOD.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; GOD, we know you want us to have it more
[1:15:38] than we want it,
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Lord God, but we got to cry out for it.
[1:15:44] Come on and say it won't rain till I
[1:15:47] call for it. It ain't going to come
