Lord we thank you oh God for musicians who conduct the Lord and thank you for the worship us today the atmosphere that has been created Lord you can say something do something for us Lord Lord I actually look upon the bereaved family those on the prayer list Lord and pray God that you God would heal and save and set free whatever the needs are for your God that supplies all of our needs according to your riches and Glory so father God we ask you to be with us now bless your word today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we're going back to Revelation 5 again and Revelation 5 and 1 and and I sow in the right hand of him that set upon the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with the loud voice he was worried to open the book and the loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven and nor in the earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to loose look upon their upon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me wheat not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood and lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth unto the all that Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set it upon the throne then the 12th verse sin with the loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing may God bless the reasons worship may be seated Worthy tonight is the Lamb praise God you know I was just saying which direction we're going and where did the lamb and I was thanking the lord for the Lamb of God is not just a song that was saying but it expresses something that should be magnified and that the lamb is truly worthy and what does it why is it that we say He's Worthy and then he said in that verse he said words of the Lamb that was slain so he was slain and we understand that the devil's a price for mankind when there was nobody Worthy in heaven nobody in Earth on the Earth was Worthy then he said the Worthy is the Lamb that was slain amen he paid the price the price of redemption here Isaiah looked at it in Isaiah 53 and seven he says he was a press and he was afflicted yet open not his mouth he was bored as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Sheriff is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken I'm saying and then he said he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich and his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him it's something about the Lamb of God and what he's done for us and what he died for us the book of Philippians 2 it teaches us that here it says in Revelation 12 he said words of the Lamb that were slain to receive power riches wisdom strength honor glory and blessing amen I think he deserves all of that and more because the prophet said that book was the book of redemption and he takes it as the abstract kind of deed to redeem us to get it back what was taken from Adam but as the price had to be paid for the book to be returned for all your rights the event your redempted rights the price had to be paid it was locked into a roof in Naomi in the Book of Ruth and Boaz went forward with the type of Christ you had to be the next of kin man Redeemer so I ain't just couldn't do it you had to be a kinsman redeemer somebody that was kin probably God had bought her it had to be a human being had to be a human the civil liberties tells us it says Philippians 2. he said if there'd be any consolation in Christ if any confident love and many fellowship with the spirit if any bowels of Mercy fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded having the Same Love being the one Accord one mind I said all you can look at is the love of God when you look at the Lamb of God that was worthy all you can look at the grace that God Express that was God's grace instead of God's judgment for us he was taken away the Judgment that we will do the judgment none of us are worthy of salvation but by the grace of God Jesus Christ amen made you and I worthy because the lamb was Worthy as we said in the Old Testament they bought a lamb without blemish and so forth and they brought it before the Austin they played that laid their hands on the lamb and their sins were supposed to be transferred unto that lamb amen when they because the wages of sin is what death but that lamb blood was animal blood so it had to be akinatory demon so that animal blood can only cover sin is it was a substitute until the real lamb came are you with me so we had a substitute amen but it was speaking of something that was to come the Old Testament was telling us something is coming there was a shadow of things to come so by the grace of God this lamb that they laid their hands on and their sins were covered now the Lamb of God come Amen to restore redempted rights everything that Adam lost in the garden Adam and Eve lost redempted rights says that I come to redeem not only you amen but to give you back your rights give you back amen your Authority and the power amen that Adam had before the fall So Adam and Eve was they were powerful they had Dominion they had power they had Authority praise God they could speak and what they said would come to pass amen they had spoken word power that was more powerful than the nuclear bombs that they are threatening the World by they're trying to hold back to nuclear war hold back the third wall whoa everybody's trying to hold that back and the world is on edge right now as China and Russia they said trying to come together everybody's on edge but brother and sister nothing can keep us but the blood of the Lamb nothing can keep you but the Blood on the doorpost and on the linen because he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen that's your only protection amen that's your only Escape from the deaf Angel for the destruction that's on the way amen it's coming praise God it's gonna the Bible tells us the world is going to melt as a the element's going to melt as affirmative Heat and the world going to be burnt up where you gonna hide or do you have a safe place do you have a place of safety praise God brother and sister our only safe places in Christ if you're not in Christ then you will not Escape will you you don't know if it's brought out that hell was never made for man but for the devil and his angels are you with me but because man chose to believe that until the Bible said hell therefore has enlarged himself he had to make a little bit more room for man to go there hell has enlarged itself and opened her mouth without bitching are you up with me we all see how Wicked The World Is Right y'all see how mean folks are amen you can give the people eternal life and they'll turn it down amen praise God they don't think the lamb is working to them he's not working amen praise God they'll believe the devil's life when Jesus offered him eternal life the Bible said he was deceived but here man amen turn down the love of God turn down amen Agape Love A Love That is stronger than death are you with me but man I turn it down For the Love of the world amen the love of the world Amen the Bible teaches us not to love the world the Lamb of God is expressing to you amen what made it worth it is his love towards us his love that was wrapped all up and how he was led didn't open his mouth because he loved you so much he loved you so much to go through the pain in the agony of calvary his love for you to land yet he opened not his mouth amen they whipped him that spit on him they called him all all kind of things but that same lamb nature he want to transfer because the life that was in the natural land it could not come back unbeliever but that same blood that Jesus said the life that was in that blood can come on you and I and we can have the same attributes praise God we can have the same kind of love that he had for us we can have that love for one another and then we can also love our enemies why because we got something inside of us that same lamb nature think about it the next time praise God when you think amen that somebody is upset you made you mad you got to check up amen oh Lord who am I you got to realize that's not me I should be humble if I'm not humble then Lord let me get out of my knees and let me pray for a breakthrough amen thank God that he said If any man sent him an advocate with the father that we can get down and say Lord I've lost my humility praise God something trying to take over praise God this house but this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and I can't allow the devil Amen to take over this house amen because this is the House of Prayer amen are you with me so you got to realize it's going to take prayer to keep your house in order amen you don't pray your house or get out of order things that happen in your life if you don't pray Jesus had to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane because he had to go through his trial and he knew amen that the tasks that were lied laid before him he knew what he was going to have to go to so he knew it was going to take much prayer he prayed somebody said Ernest lit to his sweat turn into blood are you a man because he knew what he was going to have to go through and he's going to have to have strength how I want to know how many of you praying for strength strengthened me Lord I need strength amen because I know that the things that I'm going through is going to take strength oh Hallelujah building up your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost amen praise God when you're praying you get something that comes to you and tell you it'll be all right amen God and take care of it oh you hear that little welcome in voice when you prayed and you got an answer from Lord when God speaks to your heart praise God you don't have to take matters in your own hand it's not your battle it's the law for you I'll take care the Sheep can't defend himself the lamb does not try they meant to they meant to defend they depend on the shelter amen are you dependent on the shepherd oh yes Lord will you lead me I'll follow praise God they have no it can't even run fast enough to get away don't have no teeth to bite like a lion amen is not like a leopard can run praise God oh Lord all kind of creatures God defensive acted with the Lamb of all it could do is depend on the shepherd are you up man brother and sister are you sheep dependent on the shepherd knowing that the shepherd will watch over his seat amen that's why he said the Lord is my and I amen praise God Worthy is the Lamb praise God I wish that God Amen we understand that God has made you and I amen praise God acceptable in the Beloved praise God because God so loved us amen that he gave us of his divine nature and that divine nature amen is the nature that Jesus Christ had when he walked the face of the Earth that that nature returns back into you Amen to give you virtue give your faith that gives you the temperance of God amen the patient amen Hallelujah amen this divine nature amen gives you what you need to make it through this Christian walk praise God but you see somebody amen who's going to despise the chasing of the Lord who's going to despise God's grace when God has given you but it's somebody that's going to recognize the lamb being Worthy it makes us so humble and so grateful and so thankful amen that we give him honor amen we lift our hands and we say oh oh God die away oh yes amen because whatever if you didn't do it then the book would still be in there of the original owner but thank God that you took the book yes yes amen and you loose the Seven Seas down amen praise God the book of redemption amen he paid the price where nobody else could do it how grateful we are so we have such consolation in Christ amen I'm not worried I'm confident dead and I'm confident in Christ the comfort of Love The Fellowship of the spirit the bowels of Mercy for you fulfill you my joy that you be what Philippians 2 and 2 fulfill you my joy that you'll be what like-mindedness they meant having the same what love being the what and of what let nothing be done through or what people seeking their own Glory not the glory of God vain glory in what lorness of mine let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man on his what but every man also on the things of others let this that's what I want to get to let this what yes see the Bible said we have the mind of Christ we have his mind when we lose our mind but as long as you got your I'm in my right mind your right mind is Jesus Christ mine other than that you got the wrong kind of mind thank God amen so we're saying Lord keep my mind praise God I'm talking about the mind I gotta remind me to write I got a mind to live right so my mind even blown to Jesus Holy Ghost got my mind and gone amen I remember back in the country dying the little dirt road they were singing it with a big bass drum boom boom my mind my mind is gone Holy Ghost got my mind and gone that's all they had was a big drum and boom boom Holy Ghost guy never shout my mind my mind is gone Holy Ghost got my mind and gone not thank God my mind is gone the Holy Ghost got my mind and gone that's why he says be not conformed to this world but be you what by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is the good acceptable and what perfect will of God isn't that right you got to recognize amen that he said I beseech it therefore brother and by the mercies of God that you present your bodies The Living Sacrifice and then he said be not conformed to this world would be you transformed and let us run with patience in Hebrews said 12 wherefore let us lay aside everywhere every sin amen let's run with patient the race that it set before us lay aside all of this stuff this world don't mean nothing to you if if the bombs start falling and Earth start quaking in lock it over in turkey and all over the place and uh floods and everything looked like it's happened we got record-breaking temperatures global warming and everything else and yet folks just smiling on their way like it was in the days of no they didn't care nothing about what Noah was

them out of the place brothers and sisters that's the way to be as it was in the days of knowing as it was in the days of life and I believe that's the way it is and when the son of man has been revealed right now God is revealing the son of man ministry right before us and really under the ministry of the son of man Ministry way Christ the son of man revealed himself in a son of man amen Christ amen Ministry praise God was manifested in flesh again among us but it was the ministry of the Holy Ghost ministering amen praise God and that's what it is as a holy ghost Minister as in the

in Christ who being in the form of God thought it not Robert to be what you know we go over that all the time when I'm talking about the lamb type nature amen you got to realize that God is required some of you he said Worthy is the Lamb but you know uh you know the prophet said is your life worthy of the Gospel is your life worthy of the Gospel are you living a life that's worthy of what Jesus did for you you see all they did for you do you is your life what is are you saying to God every day every moment Lord I'm not worthy of your goodness but through your grace and because of your mercy

say yes he's worthy to me amen and you might not praise him because you don't understand my praise you don't understand why I praise him like I do because I know how good he is and I know what he done for me you you maybe you don't know it he done it for you but you can't recognize it but I thank God for his grace that revealed it to me because if he had not revealed it to me I'll be like you I sat

he did it for me he did it for you thank God he did it yeah sister Brenda Lewis said he did it for me he did it for me I thank God he did it for me he thought it not robbery to be equal with God and I've been over this lately but maybe I'd re-emphasize it for somebody that might have missed him don't think of yourself more highly than you ought to think give all your glory and honor to Jesus Christ for he said without me you can yes you can do nothing but when you don't acknowledge Him in all things in all thy ways acknowledge God I can't help myself I can't even control myself I'm out of control but God if you'll help me if you've been merciful to me Lord I I run this race Lord I make it through if you just help me I need your help every hour praise God Hallelujah I'm so glad he can

praise God that's what it's all about what God wants to reveal in you what he wants to do he wants to express amen it's beyond comprehension the love of God praise God no there's no love like the love of God amen the lamb came to amen redeem you he came to shed his blood amen that you can get back in your position back in the Amen to that position that place where God made you to have dominion God
