love him amen do you love me amen amen we're certainly thankful to be here you know we uh want to say thank you to brother Henry for the uh invitation amen you know we certainly don't take it lightly you know this is a this is a place where I believe I believe it you know the prophet said don't stand behind this desk unless you have a back side of the desert experience this is a sacred desk it's a time and uh where we bring the word amen and uh we certainly love you this morning and we want to say thank you to my neighbor for coming with us amen amen um David and uh he come all this way you know I think his back started to hurt him a little bit he was like man it's a long drive I was saying about the same thing yeah I know my hip hurts I'm just kidding but we're thankful to be here amen amen you know I I believe that this is the portion where the greatest drawing power the prophet said the greatest drawing power is the gospel not just the gospel of a man or Gospel of some great Doctrine or idea but it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen it's the only name under Heaven that all men must be saved amen amen it's the name of Jesus amen amen now if you would get your Bibles would like to go right into the word as you're turning there we'll actually say a prayer amen do you love the Lord amen amen let's all bow our heads really fast and we're going to look into 1 Chronicles the 15th chapter gracious most loving heavenly father father we come before you now and we want to say thank you Father thank you for your love and for your mercy Mercy father for your mercies that are new every morning Father we want to say thank you for letting us wake up this morning and be able to gather with people of like Precious Faith father for this place that we can be able to worship father not worship a man or some idea but to worship you you father to worship you in spirit and in truth father if there's a need here within your people's heart within their lives father I pray that you would just come down in a very special way father anoint the word to the hearts to the being of your people father and anoint these lips of of clay father father set me aside Lord and just move father I might have a thought I might have the scripture before me but the prophet taught us that any man can open a Bible but he can't open the word it takes you father we're asking asking just now that you'd come down father and take me out of it take the pastor take the people out of this father and open the word to the hearts father I pray that you'd help me Lord Jesus Lord all I have is an empty vessel willing to be used father and we love you we say thank thank you we ask all these things in your name amen 1 Chronicles the 15th chapter Thank You For The Music 15th chapter in the first verse when you're there say Amen the Bible says and David made him houses in the city of David and prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched for it a tent let's look at that one more time and David made him houses in the city of David and prepared a place this morning I'd like to focus on that prepared a place I'd like to give you a title this morning on a prepared place for a prepared people a prepared place for prepared people you may be seated in the presence of the Lord now we see here in this scripture where David made the house in this city and he prepared a place now we're reminded that every day we have to make a place we always make a place everything that we do we make a place in our schedule we make a place at our job we make a place in everything that we do and David he made this place not just for some thought or some belief but he made it for an ark and this was the ark of God he made it he made a place for the God that he served he made a place that God can come and meet him he made a place but notice within this tent there was three places there was an outer Court an inner court and the Sha shakina Glory there was these places now the shika Glory was within the inner Court it was deeper it was a deeper level this is where that Ark was found no other person can enter this place except for a selected person the Levites there is only a certain people that can enter this place David would set it before us as he built the tent then David said said none ought to carry the Ark of God but the Levites and for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God so it wasn't even David's choosing it wasn't even David's what he thought would be right it was what God wanted so God desired a place and a people that would make a place for him he desired a certain people to put their thoughts and their Ambitions and their ideas away to make a place they made a place where God can be able to meet them and God would meet these Levites in other words the preacher he met the preacher in this holy of holy he met him in there so that preacher can get in tune and get the shikina glory presence on him to be able to give the word he went into this place where God can be able to meet them and they prepared this place so now we know that we prepare this place and it's every day it's not just right now on a Sunday it's a place that we go to we go to this place now we don't need to come here and maybe walk and just you know say well this is our where we find you know peace no you can find peace at your house amen you could find peace on the job you could find peace you know I I get where the scripture says forsake not the assembling of the Saints even more so as the day approaches but this doesn't have to be the only place this doesn't have to be the only place where this is your only safety place no your safety place can be at your house it's wherever you're willing to make that place but the most you know that place isn't a building it's yourself it's you making yourself available now we know that the altar is your heart you are made up of an outer being an inner being and then a soul your heart is your shika glory and your heart is where God can meet you but in order for it to happen you have to be able to open yourself up you have to move some of yourself out you have to move some of yourself out so you can be able to be fed so you can be able to be met and God longs to meet his people God longs to meet his people do you believe that and there was a certain people and these were the Levites that were the only ones that were able to enter that tent but this presence this tent you're able to meet amen you're able to make this place you're able to go into this place you're able to get into this presence get shut in with God you are able to today it doesn't have to be tomorrow it doesn't have to be next week but it could be right now at this moment it could be right now it doesn't have to wait amen cuz God is not a god of he he is a god of tomorrow he's a god of yesterday he's a god of today but he doesn't he doesn't long for you to wait he can meet you right now if you don't allow him he can meet you at any circumstance at any time now I'd like to give you the definition of what prepared would mean prepared would mean made ready for use ready to do or deal with something ready to do or deal with something many times times we make a place in our agenda so we can deal with something a problem at the house let's all gather as a family we got to get this thing set in order we got to do this now am sometimes it can't wait sometimes it has to happen right now sometimes God might tell you something and you got to do it right then just the other day the Lord laid on my heart to go pray for someone I didn't I knew they were at with cancer they just got this doctor's report but no one else knew the Lord told me go I didn't listen I went to church put a prayer request in that burden never never left me well what am I supposed to do I went I drove two hours up the road to go pray for some their testimony after it was the Lord done something in my body obedience to the Lord it will bring a blessing obedience to the Lord will bring a blessing amen when you obey the Lord when he tells you to do something he can move amen if you'll listen but so many times we let our stubborn nature and all of our ideas get in our way so many times we let our work schedules get in our way you know there's a time of preparation you know as I was sitting there brother Henry had we were on the phone and he said uh brother would you uh would you be able to come on Sunday and I said well uh well we just had a baby and maybe you know I said uh I'll be there I left my family just to come over here because the Lord laid this on my heart now during this pregnancy I found out what preparation would be but I still wasn't prepared preparation you know there was times and months where we were getting ready we were getting ready for a little promise we were getting ready for something and now this preparation we had to go buy diapers we had to go buy Wet Wipes we had to go buy all these different things get the house prepared we had to buy the the the groceries and get the uh fridge stocked up and we had to go and get the baby bed and all you know all these different things and we're getting the room prepared we're getting the place prepared am we're getting it all ready but yet we don't have our promise we're getting it ready because we're being ready amen now God he has made and desired a place to meet you amen and he's prepared this place he's gone and he's created a place many mansions prepared them just for you they're ex they're right to your I don't know how to say it your level or whatever you know they're made just for you amen they're personal amen am he made it just for you and but he can't give you that place if you won't worship if you won't sell out if you won't give him your all it takes your sacrifice to make it there and so this is he made it ready for your use he made it ready now now this baby you know I'm going to get back to the baby I'm jumping all over the place I'm sorry but this baby you know we're getting ready for this baby and we have the room prepared and we're like man we're so prepared but then that last minute my wife goes I don't know do we have enough diapers do we have enough and she starts to question are we ready are we not well I don't know you know and she starts you know many of you mothers have played this game where you just I don't know do I have enough do I have this you know am I ready am I and then the time comes well oh man we're going into labor I guess we just have to De with what we got and so now we come home with this baby and man we have more than enough because we overprepared now you see where I'm going with this you over prepare you build this place whether it be a closet wherever it is and you go and get serious with God and he'll come and meet you there he's not worried about if you have enough quotes or enough scriptures or enough experience in the Christian faith he's not worried about that he's worried about a heart he's worried about a heart that can get humbled out and come into that Pres and come into that s glory and watch him just move and and mend your hearts the Brokenness and the hurts and the and the differences and all these different things he's waiting for someone to just get serious with God and come into that presence and that unfailing presence that failing that that never failing presence of God if you just get into that presence and just forget about yourself forget about your feelings forget about how you felt at church forget about how hard it was when you got up to go to church how hard it was to get that baby dressed how hard it was he's not worried about all the all the problems he's just worried about someone that's willing to go he's worried about someone that's willing to just sell out sell all that they are remember that one boy the rich the Rich Young Ruler he would go up to Jesus said how can I receive eternal life Jesus said keep my Commandments that's it keep my Commandments says well I've done that all my all my life I was raised around it I I'm just dramatizing it I was raised around it I I know all those quotes I know I know all these things man I I'm I'm fine no no no you don't get the picture keep my Commandments well what do I lack what am I missing go and sell all sell all of what sell all your possessions sell all that you are sell it all but that wasn't the only instructions that Jesus gave them and then give all give all to who the people that don't got nothing the poor give it all he was looking for someone to be willing you see he was seeing is this boy I know he came up to me with this question but is he willing to go all the way you follow me is he willing to give it all is he willing to surrender is he willing to die out and become a new is he willing to completely go through the whole process is he willing for me to not just stop at the outer court and go into the inner Court and into the Sha Glory or is he going to hold off and be like hey stepping on my toes there I want to go to the club on Monday I want to go over here on Tuesday I want to drink my alcohol on Thursday I'll go to church on Wednesday though he was not looking for that he was looking for something someone who would dedicate and sell out all of his Ambitions his thoughts his ideas his hurts everything he wanted it all he wanted him to just say all right Lord here I give it all it's just as simple as giving him the keys to your house you just pull the keys he's just looking for some keys he wants your place but it's just he's waiting for someone to take the key and give it back to him he wants the key but we're so stubborn because we're afraid that he's going to come in our house and find something that we don't want him to find we're afraid that this key that goes into the bedroom might find something he don't want to find that key to your heart he's waiting on someone to give him that last key but you want to hold on to that lust you want to hold on to that hurt that Brokenness feeling like nobody loves you feeling like nobody cares about you he's looking for someone to give him that place prophet of God says here it is I just happened to come up or come to it happened to come to me then brother if you're only wearing a church garment you better get rid of that thing you can't go behind the holiest of holies the Garment that the high priest wore in there had to be made out of by the holy land a selected Goods amen ordained of God there it is so if you join church and you think it's all right you're wrong see it has to be God select it has to be a god selected robe and our self-righteous rags won't stand in his presence it takes the Holy Spirit which is the robe of God that dresses the believer behind the holiest of holy oh that's good I like that that was a new one never swallowed one like that before but that is or that's it just that kind it's that real vitamin see it takes the holy spirit so that Holy Spirit is your garment it should be your garment it should be what follows you it should be with what's on you it should be what's surrounding you you know you should have so much of the Holy Spirit within you and on you that when you bump into someone they'll ask you hey what do you got you should have so much on you that when you walk into the store someone can see a light about you and know hey there's something different about you I need to run over here and talk to you I need to know about this Jesus I need to know about this man I need to know about this hey he took your sins away man how can I get my sins toen away how can I meet this man how can I and they'll start to ask questions I'm speaking from experience when you get into that presence That shik Glory when he's welcomed into your house when he's welcomed into your heart he'll overflow he'll he'll be an overflow he'll be that safety place you can feel safe in him it's not your friends at school or your church members or your pastor but it would be a relationship between you and God he's not looking for a relationship with your mom or your daddy amen he's looking for a relationship between you and your personal Creator he's looking for someone that would surrender to their creator surrender to their God surrender and say Lord I can't do this on my own Lord I need you in the time of my trouble Lord I need you in my Brokenness but how do I get him if I don't have a place how do I get him if I don't have a place in my heart for Him how do I get him if I don't have a place that he can meet me in my Brokenness in my hurt how do I get him if I'm broken how do I get him because I don't have a place I haven't surrendered I have I'm that I'm that Rich Young Ruler I'm afraid if I give him all then I'm going to be bound to some religion I'm afraid that if I give him all that I'm going be bound to some Creed or some Doctrine I'm afraid that if I give him everything everything that I'm going to be a a nobody we don't want to be a nobody I said we not you we it's our stubborn nature we want to be as somebody we want to be recognized it feels good feels good to be recognized feels good to be known but aren't you thankful that you have a God that knows you he knows you in the good he knows you in the bad he knows you when you are broken when you feel unlovable that's right he knows you when you're hurt am he knows you when you need him he knows you when you feel like you don't but he knows you always he's a very constant friend he's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother he's a friend that will be there for you in the good and in the bad when things are going good and when they're not amen he's that kind of friend he's that kind of God Amen he's that kind of God he loves you so much he can I speak about the love of God for a little bit he loves you so much that he would go down by the way of you when you were in sin when you were in your sinful rags and he'll say hey come your child I know you might not be dressed right you might not act right you might not do things right you you might you might do things of the world but hey I'm not looking at your insufficiencies I'm looking at you I'm not looking at what your hurts are I'm looking at you I'm not looking at your emotions I'm looking at you I'm looking at the heart I'm looking at that heart that needs some mending I'm looking at that heart that needs some love I need I'm looking at that heart he's looking at the heart because he loves you he loves you he loves everything about you he loves your being he loves you you know you were created created in his likeness you were created to be like him created to walk with him created to talk with him he desires worship so much that he created you so you can worship him in the very beginning he created Adam and Eve so they could worship they could worship in spirit and in truth but then the fall happened but he had another plan it was a Plan of Redemption he he breached the way so you could go free he breached the way the water wat so you can come out of your sin he preached it so you could be free he preached it because he loved you it was a love affair it's never been a Doctrine it's never been just a book but it's been a love letter to the church that's all it is it's a love letter to the Saints it's a love letter so you could go free when you read it the wages of sin is death but there's another way amen amen it was a love affair he didn't create you to die he didn't create you to drown he didn't create you to lose you he's known you all along he's cared for you all along he's just looking for that [Applause] place he's looking for that place brother looking for that place sister because he loves you amen amen am I allowed to take my jacket off am but he done it because he loves you thank you brother thank you are you thankful for his love are you thankful you know it's not just the person or the people that makes a place it's the eagle I'd like to speak to you on an eagle this Eagle as it's watching it's young before the babies are born she makes a place she makes this Nest to fit the babies likes and wants and needs she makes this place so they can feel welcomed to their new home she makes this place so she can raise her little ones and this Eagle will sit up on the top of a Mountaintop or in a tree many times it's on a cliff and this Eagle will make this nest of these sticks and all these different things and but notice before she would do anything with the papa Eagle she tests him she'll pull a stick off a branch drop it and if he doesn't Chase for it she won't do nothing with him she'll be like all right that's dead meat see you later Felicia move on to the next one and she'll find this one that will actually chase that stick grab the stick and bring it back to her and then she knows that that is the kind of man that would reach for her loved ones when they fall then she knows that that's that kind of man that would reach down and love that little one don't let him hit the ground and rescue them and forgive them and love them and then now these babies are in the nest and there's a time where they're little and they start to grow but they don't know how to fly now this Eagle when they get a little older she starts to move things around starts to move them around a little bit and says all right well now it's time that you go to church now it's time that you learn a little bit because it's not always a time of you being a baby you got to learn but it's not off your mama's experience you were raised under your mom's experience but there's a time where that Mama's experience has to become your own and this Eagle doesn't know how to fly doesn't know how to walk doesn't know how to do nothing on its own she says all right get up it's time to go to school oh Mom but I'm I'm content where I'm at I don't want to get uncomfortable I'm fine with my brothers and my sisters here nope nope sometimes you got to Walk This Way alone boom get out of here kicks it and this Eagle starts to Tumble through the air and Falls but that Daddy Eagle that's been circling all along watching over the mama and the babies sees that baby catches it goes back up drops it again well why would the dad grab it and drop it again because he's teaching it that you're going to have ups and downs in this life you're going to have hurts and complexes in this life but all along because I'm your daddy I won't let you hit that ground I'll be there for you in the good I'll be there for you in the bad and I'll take you back to that place and this baby eagle tumbles to the ground again and he says just open your wings little one just open them you have the wings for a reason just open them you'll get it naturally if you'll just listen to me am starts to Tumble well it's unbalanced it doesn't know how to do it on its own because it doesn't have this experience yet amen and he'll catch it before hits the ground and then goes back up and does it again you're going to learn this by the end of this class you're going to learn this by the end of this time tumbles again and flab his wings and finally he goes dad I got it I know how to use my wings and begins to Flap his wings still doesn't have the strength in his wings so the dad catches him again says you almost got it you know how to work your wings but now see if you could fly takes him back again and this Eagle Falls and starts to Flap his wings and now he begins to fly you see where I'm going with this you go up and down in life but all along your father which is in heaven protects you all along your heavenly father cares about you am all along your heavenly father loves you amen and he wants you and he wants to see you prosper amen he doesn't want to see you fail when you go up and down he doesn't want to see you hit the ground so he won't ever let you amen because he loves you amen amen and this Eagle begins to fly and then now the mama Eagle says now scream little one because you have a certain voice you have a certain type of voice friends you have a special kind of voice Eagles food spiritual food in due season amen there's a certain time and there's a certain place where God will deal with you amen it's not it's not always in the times that you feel comfortable he wants you to get uncomfortable so he can do something he doesn't want you to be comfortable in your nice little habitat where you feel good and you have all the friends in the world and you have everyone that seemed to before you hey don't trust your friends more than God the Bible says in Jeremiah he said cursed is the man that trusteth in a man and maketh flesh his arm that's right but blessed is the man whose hope the Lord is am what was Jeremiah saying he was saying don't trust trust in the friends don't trust in your rulers don't trust in these people but trust God trust God in the good and in the bad because he'll be there for you Paul said I've never nor never seen the righteous forsaken never seen it have you ever seen anyone forsaken never seen it I've never seen anyone forsaken because Jesus said I will never leave you nor will I forsake you but I'll be with you always even until the end of the world Amen it's a promise friends it's a promise that he'll be with you in the good and in the bad he'll be there for you in your hurts and your Brokenness because he loves you and there's a place of safety he's a refuge he's a strong tower the righteous run into it they shall be saved they run into that Tower they'll be saved because that God that you serve he's there with his wings he's ready to take you into his Embrace he wants to hold you he wants to care for you but so many times we we are scared we're scared of that presence we're scared of God to move we're scared to surrender we're scared that God might have us act out of order maybe he might make you dance a little bit some people are scared of the gifts they're scared of discernment because they're fine with their little secret sins they're fine with nobody knowing about their Brokenness just the other day I was speaking on a little thought broken but not forsaken so many times our trial breaks us but really the trial if you look back wasn't the trial that really broke you you broke yourself the prophet of God said the greatest your greatest enemy is yourself because this flesh can't be sa saved can't be forgiven but your soul can your greatest enemy is yourself those things that you've done in your life you beat yourself up I if I could have done this or if I could have done that or if I could have said this or you know preachers we do it when we preach man if I could have read that scripture or if I could have read that quote or if I could have if I could have I could have could have we play it all that time man I man I had that on the tip of my tongue and I couldn't say man can I go back and say you know we play that game all along we we battle we battle our flesh because our flesh men speak man if we could have made the Lord move but you can't make the Lord do nothing he's looking for someone to surrender you feel me he's looking for someone that will love him how do you show your love to him by worshiping in spirit and in truth that's how you show love God loves you so much you know why often times do we have troubled hearts and wonder if God loves us you know because Jesus said in the Bible he said let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God if you believe in God why are you troubled believe also in me like you know we I'm saying we because I know how it is man if I hate how the guys at work treat us you know and we play this man work is I don't want to go back nobody does just like I didn't want to go to school I played that sick card a lot you ever done that I'd like to play that card at work too but you know doesn't work boss catches on a little bit I'm just messing around but in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you he's not a man that he should lie David said I go and prepare a place for you are you thankful that he prepared a place for you a place where moth nor rust nor thieves can break in but a place of safety he went and prepared that place you know the Bible would tell you that where your heart is there is where your treasure is also where's your heart at this morning can I get personal for a little bit do you love the pleasures of world More Than Love of God because I'm reminded as my Bible would tell me lovers of Pleasures if they love the pleasures more than the love of God the love of God's not even in them and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again that was a promise he's coming back not just for one of you I want to trust and believe it's for all of us and receive you unto myself you see that's a great love story he's going to come back for you and for me and receive you to himself the greatest love story and receive you unto myself that where I am ye may be also that's into our celestial bodies over there that you will be with him and whether I go ye go in the way ye know now Thomas would say unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know he was always doubting wasn't he like I mean it seems like I heard him you know be told of doubting Thomas doubting Thomas he was doubting Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto me or unto the father but by me and if you had known me ye should have known that my f or known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him it's a promise friends it's a promise of love friends if I in closing it as musicians would come held you in captivity long enough I'd like to maybe for a few moments just in closing give you a little thought How Great Is Our God splend of the king cloth inest you see friends so many times we wonder what would my friend say if I make a [Music] place what would what would my mama say if I completely surrendered we're always fighting friends I can I give you a little bit of my background for years I was raised under a doctrine of return Ministry now all I ever knew was a prophet all I ever knew was a tent Vision Tent Revival but I never knew the god you see friends I I had went off a mama's experience off a daddy's experience now they wouldn't never claim that but that's what they believed and all I ever knew was this and that and quotes and you know a few scriptures here and there but I knew more stories about a man's life than I did a god of the Bible Bible all I ever knew was a prophet but you see friends it's deeper than a man it's deeper than a vessel God can use Joshua can use brother Henry he can use anyone in this room they have to be willing but you see if brother Henry would preach this sermon that I'm preaching right now God can use him to meet someone I maybe can't but notice it's not he or I it's the gift that's in him it's the gift that's in me but it's the God who gave that gift that works that gift now notice you operate this gift I can't operate this he can't operate it you operate it how do you operate it by saying amen you know I come from that background of door dead than a doornail it was a sin almost to say Amen everybody stand up when the tape gets played everybody sits down you know I'm I'm not talking bad I'm just saying you know we worship of man I I knew a man I knew some thought some idea I can tell you the scriptures that he preached for for uh Rapture his background scripture for that was psalms 27 for in the times of trouble you see all I ever knew was scriptures or thoughts or quotes but friends it's not that way doesn't have to be that way he can't make the place for you you have to make the place for yourself so that the God that he had in him can come and meet you and be in you also friends I I didn't know that for a long time about 15 years old I completely surrendered and was baptized but all I ever knew was that background until that experience hit me I was almost dumbfounded when I found out man are you telling me that there was more to this story I'm not saying I didn't know what God I knew of him but it seemed like this man was more of the responsibility than what he should have been I'm not discrediting him now but you see friends I when I came in contact with God God completely changed my life it couldn't be my mama tell me that that was wrong it couldn't be my daddy telling me that it was wrong or to do this or to do that but it was now my daddy God tell me hey get your life in order he brought order into my life as many quotes as I knew telling me that this is wrong you can't chew gum in the church and you can't you know that that wasn't going to cut it that's not my salvation but when God got a hold of my life life he changed me he told me what the way should be he told me how to go that way he showed me how to walk showed me how to talk showed me how to act it wasn't based off a religion anymore you know what a religion is Prophet God told us it's a covering it's a covering it's so that people if they want to know more they have to pry for it hey uncover that thing let me see what do you believe I remember 15 years old I was I had gotten contact with God and you know in the Christian faith you have ups and downs well I learned how it is to get distant and I got distant within that few months period about 16 and a half I was a little Wayward and running from a call I knew the Lord was calling me to preach I didn't want to do it I didn't want nothing to do with it I ran hung out with the wrong crowd cussed I'm just being transparent you see friends I as I was out with these people I remember the Lord working through my grandma cuz all my daddy would do would tell me hey you're wrong you're wrong you know you're doing wrong hey this is that you know you need to do this and I was like Dad be quiet know I mean and as I started to do my own thing my grandma called me one day and says hey we have some church meetings now I knew if there was one person in the world my Grandma loved me and uh she called me and asked me if I'd come so I went to those meetings and I remember a preacher he uh he was preaching and he uh I think he was preaching on this is the sound of your freedom and he looks at me and he says Dylan how long are you going to run I never told him a thing and I looked at him and I tried to pretend like I didn't hear him and he says how long are you going to run and he come down right to my level he stepped off the stage and he came right over to me and he said God called you and he says why don't you get your life back in order and he walked away just him saying that impacted me so much I was at an altar within two seconds and as I was at that altar the Lord completely changed my life filled me with the Holy Spirit you know I I didn't ask for a gift I didn't ask for a call but it was placed in you from birth from birth you can't send away that gift amen cuz it's in you you can misplace that gift but you can't send it away and so the Lord completely changed my life over this course of time and about 17 and a half I started preaching I didn't start in a church I started on the streets I was preaching to people on the sidewalks preaching to people at the parks preaching to people doing some missionary work on the Indian reservations I remember one time I was in Phoenix Arizona staying with my aunt and I heard a woman screaming and this woman she was screaming with such a high pitch I'm in trouble kind of sound my first instinct is I'm going to go out and see if she's okay I went out and this woman she's pounding on this door let me in let me in let me in I I said ma'am are you okay I didn't know what to do she didn't hear me and she kept screaming louder and louder and louder I said said ma'am are you okay and she says it's just so hard I said what's going on what it was was her her dad had left her and the family it was around Christmas time she didn't have nobody she felt like she didn't have nobody she said my daddy left us and it's just so different not having him here for Christmas he won't have nothing to do with us no contact nothing he just completely left the face of the Earth she said I don't know what to do I said I know a man that can help you I started telling her about Jesus within a two-minute period of me talking to her her frantic her being frantic stopped and now she she walks back inside her brother noticed a change her brother comes out walks up to me and gets face to face with me and he says was that you that just talked to my sister it's more of a thug I was scared to death he come up to me and he says was that you that just talked to my sister I said yes sir and right then he began to cry I didn't have to say a thing you see what it was was I had been in a place the presence of the Lord had been surrounding 11:51 in the morning or in the evening this boy just begin to cry says there's something different he says I need you to take me to this difference right there on a street corner Phoenix Arizona he began to just SOB his girlfriend was right there he said she's like babe it's okay you know just she's trying to take him away cuz she didn't like to see him cry and he says leave me alone he says I'm in a presence right now he saysi want to stay here right there on that street corner I still remember his name I remember I told him I said God is able his name was Abel I said you know God is able and that just it broke him even more he said lead me to this Jesus that you talk about right there on a street corner 11:51 in the evening he made the Declaration Jesus I'll serve you two weeks later he was baptized in Jesus name it wasn't anything I could have done but it was because of a place it because of being in a presence and the Shina of Glory it's because of being in that place of worship you ever notice your count will change when you worship it's because there's a creation of atmosphere happening this atmosphere that we're in right now do you do you realize how how close he is right now he's as close right now as you as you'll let him be his presence is here right now is it not is it here he's here right now the prophet of God said the Angels line the walls they line the walls and they move within the pews back and forth one critical spirit he said those angels will pass you over and it will ruin that whole area right there that you're on he he said it will actually ruin their blessing they won't get their blessing because of one critical spirit just one but the god that you serve he's right here and he wants to meet that need if you have a need this morning would you lift your hand there's so many needs all over this room every eye bowed there's needs all over this room there's needs maybe I can't even give you the answer but my God right now thank I believe under the authority of his word can set you completely free he'll touch your body if you'll allow him he'll free your broken heart he'll commends you cuz that's the God that he is friends if you need to make a place this morning the altar is opened I'd invite you to come forward he wants to have have a love affair with you

presence of the [Music] king oh in the presence of [Music] jeh he's God all Mighty Prince of Peace TR man heart in the [Music] presence of the king play it softly for a minute friends if I can I'd like to share one more testimony maybe two there's just a wonderful presence for about a year and a half I had a sister-in-law that would run with a homosexual spirit I don't know why I feel led to share this but she ran with the spirit and it was battling her she didn't want nothing to do with church because she knew the church would tell her that she was [Music] wrong friends she didn't want nothing to do with a preacher she didn't want nothing to do with her mama didn't want nothing to do with her brother-in-law nothing to do with her sister she didn't want nothing to do with us because she knew that we were church members so she ran she moved to another state lived this life for a year and a half but then one day the Lord started dealing on our heart friends it wasn't how many sermons I could preach wasn't how many sermons her daddy could preach but it was because the Lord is real he came by and told her go to church she went to a church and this church the people ex uh had accepted her but the pastor didn't says I don't want to see you back because of the way you look she left church didn't want to go back but she still had this burden on her heart this tug on her soul she couldn't let it go she called me and said Dylan can I go to church with you I said absolutely I knew the pastor that turned her away know him very well I wondered for a moment if he won't let a sinner in his church what's he preaching is he preaching about the grace of God is he preaching about the love of God or is he just preaching some thought or some idea friends I told the Lord I said Lord I don't want to preach a sermon just to preach A good sermon I'm not a preacher I've I've been around way better preachers but I'm a minister because I told the Lord I said Lord I don't want to preach A good sermon I want to preach a sermon that will minister to the hearts and if it's not doing that then why are we preaching it's it's not a good sermon that will get you saved but it's a sermon that can deep go deep down into your soul and make you want to change it will answer questions to your needs it'll answer your problems your family problems your hurts if you'd allow him and this sister-in-law she came to church with me and good friend of mine was preaching and I can't remember what he was preaching but through discernment he looked at her out of the whole crowd he said young sister says you've been walking down a dark dark road for the past year and a half and he says and you want to go free she knew he was talking to her she began to kind of cry he says come forward and she came forward to about right here and he looked at her and he got down on her level and he said sister he says I love you why did he tell her that he loved her cuz my Bible reads that love conquers a multitude of sin I love you she looked at him and she just began to cry it wasn't him telling her that he loved her but it was because the realization struck I'm loved you're loved and highly favored this morning for and she looked at him and he said sister do you believe that you could go free if I could show you all the love that I have how much more does God love you and she just broke and right there at my church she made the profession that God I leave my Wicked way and I completely sell out to you and I give you my all I want to serve you I want to worship you I want to love on you I want to be with you it wasn't anymore about walking a sinful life she wanted to leave that Wicked way because she stepped into a place and found a presence an unfailing presence and it took complete control of her and it broke the way that she was changed her you look at her today brother she's not who she used to be that's what the gospel will do amen amen through love and compassion amen if it's preached correctly with the right heart it can change your life amen amen I'm not going to say can it will amen amen it's a promise it will amen it will change your life amen completely yes it'll set you free amen amen it will free those thoughts that are going through your head you might be bound with things right now in fact some of you are some of you have addictions that you can't seem to go free of one of your addictions is fear you're scared you realize that the prophet of God said that fear is one of those the most prevalent used demons to capture people it's a demon that will come and be placed on God is not the author of fear you don't have nothing to be scared of you don't have to be scared of him because he loves you he cares for you cares for your family and he loves you but people for years have been scared of a move of God every eye bowed some of you have questions some of you don't understand why Mom and Dad have you dress the way you do speak the way you do cuz you've been held under a written word hasn't been a love letter to you you because of how it's been presented so you've been scared because you don't know is this what it would make me to be if I use the word in this way if I tell people they're wrong if I tell people that they're a sinner but friends I want to declare to you this morning that Jesus loves you let that sink in those words Jesus loves you it's personal would you believe me if I told you I love you if you believe that I want I want to hear you guys say Amen if you believe that I want you to know that I love you if I didn't get anything else across to you guys this morning just know I love you but this fear that is moving here right now it's got to go when I come back brother Henry I'm going to see a free people can I say that cuz I'm believing it everyone this is going to be a place of Refuge where you can run to the altar freely not have nobody to wonder what they're doing what they're going up there for what sin did they commit this time because that's what some of you guys are scared of that's why some of you guys didn't come forward you're scared of what your brother or your sister would say because people like to look people like to talk but you have no fear with God CU he loves you just now we're going to go before the Lord if you need to come forward with prayer I'll pray for you Lord Jesus father how very near you are Lord and you see the need father you see the hurts father you see the Brokenness but how you love us Lord Jesus [Music] father this fear that has been
