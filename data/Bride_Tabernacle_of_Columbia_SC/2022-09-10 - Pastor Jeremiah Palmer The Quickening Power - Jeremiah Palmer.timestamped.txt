[36:39] of ephesians
[36:42] the second chapter
[36:45] ephesians 2
[36:50] 1
[36:55] one and two
[36:57] and you
[36:59] hath he quickened
[37:02] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[37:06] where any time pass you walk according
[37:09] to the course of this world
[37:12] according to the prince
[37:13] and the of the power of the air
[37:16] the spirit that now worketh in the
[37:19] children
[37:20] of disobedience and go back with me to
[37:23] the book of psalms please
[37:27] i want to speak just a few minutes
[37:28] tonight
[37:34] on the quickening power
[37:37] the quickening
[37:39] power
[37:41] i know we have heard
[37:43] before
[37:45] and we have heard it maybe from
[37:47] different angles but tonight
[37:51] we need the quickening power
[37:55] the word quicken means to
[37:59] be
[38:00] made alive
[38:03] to be made alive
[38:06] here david
[38:09] was saying here
[38:12] in
[38:13] 119 and thirties he said turn away my
[38:15] eyes from beholding vanity in other
[38:17] words
[38:19] david just didn't
[38:21] uh want just to look at something that
[38:23] really have no value to it
[38:27] david
[38:29] was looking for god to quicken him
[38:37] i believe tonight that
[38:40] that's one of the things that
[38:43] that i see is liking
[38:49] so much he desire
[38:53] i understand that we have plenty of
[38:58] truth
[39:00] that god had made known to us in this
[39:03] hour
[39:06] we call it you know the message
[39:12] and i appreciate
[39:13] what god did in this hour
[39:18] but paul said one place that
[39:20] the letter killeth
[39:23] but the spirit give life
[39:28] paul say one place ah we didn't come to
[39:31] you with enticing words of
[39:34] men's wisdom but we came to you in
[39:36] demonstration
[39:38] and power of the holy ghost
[39:42] i wonder sometimes or rather we afraid
[39:45] of it
[39:47] or the quickening power
[39:50] i mean there's a song that i like to
[39:52] sing in the song but it's called the old
[39:54] time holy spirit and the devil
[39:57] won't go near it
[40:01] it is more than just a song it's a
[40:03] reality
[40:06] because the devil knows that as long as
[40:10] we just have the mechanical
[40:14] of the bible the truth
[40:18] with no spirit with no quickening
[40:22] power
[40:24] remember he is a good impersonator
[40:30] i believe i i could say i guess
[40:33] because that
[40:34] it started in heaven that he preached to
[40:38] a third of god's angels
[40:42] i believe he must have had something
[40:44] that he said that really sound
[40:47] convincing
[40:51] and it convinced a third of the angels
[40:54] to believe
[40:55] his lie
[40:59] so it's showing that uh even satan
[41:03] himself the bible said can be
[41:06] transformed into an angel of light
[41:12] in other words he has a gospel also
[41:18] every time god moved the devil moves
[41:23] but he only impersonates
[41:27] what god has already established
[41:31] and it looked like uh he's getting
[41:34] uh
[41:35] a big
[41:37] um
[41:38] i want to say this
[41:40] a lot of people to believe his lie
[41:45] because that
[41:46] the socialism of being a
[41:50] motivated speaker
[41:53] see
[41:54] and in this age we have
[41:57] a
[41:58] school that where you can really go and
[42:02] learn how to articulate
[42:06] and you can move crowds
[42:11] with emotionalism
[42:16] but where is the power
[42:21] the gospel we are talking about
[42:24] it ought to be a living
[42:27] resurrection
[42:29] of jesus christ displaying his word
[42:38] oh i i just wished
[42:41] as i just looked and just sometimes
[42:44] over the banister a little bit you know
[42:47] and
[42:48] and just i'm wondering sometimes
[42:51] what are we missing
[42:54] when i say we i mean overall what are we
[42:56] missing with all of the truth
[43:00] that god has made known to us
[43:04] it still yet don't seem to make us alive
[43:10] don't we have a lot of information do we
[43:13] have uh what we call the truth as paul
[43:16] called it present day truth
[43:21] and i thank god for it you know
[43:23] uh for god's sending it
[43:27] but i understand just laying it there
[43:31] on the bible and we rehearse it we we
[43:34] quote it
[43:36] uh what are our little favorites saying
[43:38] say what he say
[43:42] and that's all right but how about let's
[43:45] make the word come alive then
[43:49] because just to say
[43:51] what somebody said a child can repeat
[43:54] what you say
[44:00] but what we need is a quickening power
[44:05] something to
[44:07] change
[44:09] our very inside
[44:14] and it'll cause our life to
[44:17] uh reflect
[44:19] jesus christ
[44:22] it'll make you so salty that somebody
[44:26] want what you got
[44:30] they had so much of the quickening power
[44:33] in the book of the acts when they saw
[44:35] that man
[44:36] there they get beautiful at our prayer
[44:40] he was looking to receive something
[44:43] you know they had something
[44:46] and wherever they went if you notice
[44:49] after the holy ghost came upon them
[44:52] wherever they went
[44:55] something happened
[44:58] did this peter just didn't preach his uh
[45:01] inauguration sermon and nothing happened
[45:05] but when he got to preaching this
[45:07] immediate brethren
[45:09] what must we do
[45:13] see the gospel had
[45:15] power in it the break conviction
[45:20] on the people's heart
[45:22] and they got not only convicted they got
[45:25] converted
[45:28] that's what we need
[45:30] we need a gospel that when we preach it
[45:34] men's heart we get pricked
[45:37] because as i heard the pastor said you
[45:39] can't get convicted and still don't get
[45:42] converted
[45:43] but if it's preached right and if the
[45:46] holy ghost quicken it right then it'll
[45:49] bring conviction
[45:54] oh my
[45:57] what an hour
[45:59] we live i'm
[46:01] remembering also elijah
[46:04] i believe was confronted with the
[46:05] prophets of baal
[46:10] and there was 400
[46:13] against one
[46:18] but a larger new way stood
[46:22] he knew what he had
[46:25] he knew that what god had gave him
[46:29] it will show up
[46:32] and when he met the challenge of that
[46:35] hour and since then brother you're going
[46:37] to face a challenge
[46:42] so we must be prepared for the challenge
[46:47] that we are approaching
[46:50] when you're approaching demon powers
[46:54] epilepsy and all kind of you got to have
[46:58] something
[46:59] you got to know that you know that the
[47:02] god that you're talking about he'll come
[47:04] on the scene
[47:07] because you might can't wait till you
[47:09] get to the doctors
[47:11] you might can't wait till the ambulance
[47:14] come
[47:16] but you can call him on the scene
[47:20] and you can declare lord your word
[47:23] declared
[47:25] that these sons shall follow us
[47:32] somebody say god will show up and heal
[47:35] you out
[47:37] the quickening power
[47:41] yeah i just see a great liking
[47:46] a lot of mechanics
[47:51] a lot of enthusiasm
[47:56] but that's not what you need
[47:58] it's okay to be excited it's okay to be
[48:00] enthused that
[48:02] but get something know what you got
[48:07] we got to know where we standing with
[48:09] god or not
[48:11] i'll be the uh sort of governor saying
[48:12] that the five uh identification of the
[48:15] true the living church
[48:19] is the vindication of power of god
[48:23] we must have it
[48:25] the early church had it
[48:30] the ministry had it
[48:33] that's why they went all over the place
[48:36] preaching the gospel
[48:38] and the word preached them into
[48:40] demonstrate
[48:43] see a lot of people went out
[48:46] with a letter of jesus
[48:49] but when it comes to saying sir we will
[48:51] see jesus
[48:55] that's what the people are longing for
[48:59] they're longing for a living god you say
[49:02] you have a message but then where is god
[49:08] come on don't tell me you got a message
[49:10] and you got no power with it
[49:14] i'm not talking about the written power
[49:16] out of shouting on the same i'm telling
[49:18] a demonstration power
[49:21] that when people come to god they come
[49:24] to church expecting god to do something
[49:28] then god will do it
[49:33] oh no this church here ain't no weak
[49:35] church
[49:36] not god's church
[49:39] that's why you know we got really seek
[49:42] god
[49:44] we got to really
[49:46] you know i mean it takes something i'm
[49:49] understanding the more numbers
[49:52] i'm understanding this we cannot sit
[49:54] around in a message
[49:57] we can't just sit around of the thing
[50:00] god has spoken it's all right listen to
[50:03] that
[50:04] but it got the company please say lord
[50:06] let the very word be manifested in
[50:10] me not just the preacher sister children
[50:15] brother
[50:16] you can do it
[50:18] amen
[50:22] but it's a price
[50:25] not many people want to pay it
[50:30] one of the reasons i believe we're not
[50:31] getting is because we are too loose
[50:36] our walk has become so
[50:38] loose
[50:40] we don't have the time anymore
[50:43] to seek god
[50:47] we don't have that urgency in us they
[50:51] said someone said lord make me desperate
[50:55] don't wait on nobody else you get
[50:58] desperate
[51:02] i'm understanding now very clearly
[51:06] you know i'll say this real really
[51:10] you don't know what comes with certain
[51:12] things until you get in that particular
[51:15] area
[51:17] and then that is saying you understand
[51:19] it better by and by
[51:21] yeah i'm understanding some things
[51:24] by and by getting clearer now
[51:28] understanding that when the people in
[51:31] bondage spiritually speaking bondage
[51:34] demon powers had done come in on the
[51:38] people
[51:40] and got them in such a spiritual
[51:43] condition that it's like they don't even
[51:48] care what uh what's going on with me did
[51:52] they know that they're they're drifting
[51:56] i looked in the words drifting it's a
[51:58] gradually
[51:59] moving away
[52:02] see it don't happen all of a sudden but
[52:06] little by little we drift away from
[52:09] prayer alive
[52:12] we lift we drift away from fasting
[52:16] we don't hardly read our bible
[52:19] until a sudden school
[52:26] if you had a tally up how many hours you
[52:28] put in
[52:31] lord have mercy to be ashamed
[52:35] but there used to be a time
[52:39] we were on fire for god
[52:44] it there used to be a time we didn't
[52:46] wait on nobody else
[52:50] because it wait breaks the wagon down
[52:54] we wait around years
[52:58] come on y'all come on y'all come on
[53:01] and the more you say it did you further
[53:04] away
[53:06] i understand that it gonna take god
[53:12] and only those that have a desire lord i
[53:16] know i need you
[53:19] nobody else in the church might not say
[53:22] it god but i realize that i can't even
[53:26] walk except you hold my hand
[53:30] lord i don't know what tomorrow gonna
[53:32] hold god but i know who holds tomorrow
[53:36] it's gonna take something brother sister
[53:39] to keep us in god in this hour
[53:42] you're not going to get it just by this
[53:44] creeping alone it got to be urgency
[53:56] and i understand this
[54:00] a lot of times
[54:04] sometimes we work ourselves to death
[54:09] pastor sometimes because of the burden
[54:10] they have
[54:12] for souls the burden they have for the
[54:14] people
[54:16] but then it comes to a place and the
[54:18] scripture said
[54:19] save yourself
[54:24] the bible say examine yourself
[54:27] i think that's a good thing all of us
[54:29] need to do
[54:30] go home and examine ourself
[54:35] save yourself
[54:36] we are so running after this with a
[54:38] doubt one and trying to get them in and
[54:41] just writing that right no
[54:43] you got to save yourself
[54:47] you got to get some way and say god i
[54:49] want to be certain i got oil
[54:54] if i got it lord i need more water
[54:58] i need my fire to be burning hard
[55:02] burning burning burning every morning
[55:04] every afternoon every night lord let me
[55:07] burn
[55:09] and nobody else catch on fire lord you
[55:12] catch on fire
[55:16] someone said lord
[55:18] i wish somebody's so
[55:22] lord what we need is somebody if god can
[55:25] illuminate
[55:28] somebody
[55:30] this other day we had a
[55:32] uh new couple came from florence
[55:35] um
[55:37] and both of them
[55:40] you know want to give their life to the
[55:42] lord
[55:43] hopefully we'll be doing a baptism with
[55:45] them real soon
[55:47] but you see the excitement
[55:51] and you don't holly you know when a new
[55:52] convert
[55:54] you know come and they catch a fire or
[55:57] something
[55:59] and the one that just sitting around
[56:03] you know but we need those converts
[56:08] we need those people somehow lord send
[56:11] that last elected wherever they at god
[56:18] and lord let them be hungry and thirsty
[56:21] for you
[56:24] while others may be lingering and until
[56:26] they darling around god there's a work
[56:30] that you still do in god lord put
[56:33] somebody in my path
[56:36] direct me lord to somebody that want you
[56:42] not just church but we need god
[56:47] we've had churches we've had this and
[56:50] but we need the reality lord stir us up
[56:54] again
[57:01] that's what we need
[57:05] we need a power
[57:08] that'll break yokes
[57:12] i understand that
[57:14] we need deliverance
[57:18] since all of this had happened
[57:21] the pandemic in all
[57:25] the mold of the people
[57:27] had been dropped back
[57:31] so
[57:34] where now they don't even really see the
[57:36] need
[57:37] that they need to come to church
[57:41] they think they need more
[57:44] to go and get a better job
[57:48] but those things
[57:50] have seized here see that vanity
[57:54] this lord don't let my eyes look at
[57:56] vanity
[57:58] not saying those things are all right
[58:00] well let me tell you so sister brother
[58:02] you can make it to the mountaintop
[58:05] and what that gonna get you into heaven
[58:11] you can gain this whole world but at the
[58:14] end of the day
[58:18] your soul is saying i'm thirsty
[58:22] i need help
[58:25] can somebody get a breakthrough
[58:29] can somebody do something that to wake
[58:33] me
[58:34] up the bible says paul says stir up the
[58:38] gift
[58:40] that's what we need
[58:43] we need something to stir us up
[58:47] and that's what the holy ghost let me
[58:49] tell you something
[58:51] we always are waiting it always had been
[58:53] a i guess uh a thing that we always wait
[58:57] you know until the preachers our pastor
[59:01] say it
[59:04] because oh i know he got it and i know i
[59:06] see god
[59:08] let me tell yourself god want to use you
[59:12] the same holy ghost the same quickening
[59:16] power
[59:17] that's jubilizing him you are to have it
[59:20] too
[59:24] i know we have drifted
[59:27] delayed the seal spirit and god upon
[59:31] but us
[59:31] believe you said samson the philistines
[59:35] is upon the samson
[59:39] we need to shake ourselves as samson did
[59:44] but he played around with delilah too
[59:47] long
[59:49] and he lost
[59:52] the quickening power
[59:55] oh how he remembered how god used to
[59:58] move
[59:59] and that's what all some of us have i'm
[1:00:02] saying overall not just here over broad
[1:00:05] all we can remember how god used to do
[1:00:12] so god ain't doing that no more
[1:00:16] sister brother i'm afraid that that's
[1:00:18] not so
[1:00:20] i know he done painted that picture but
[1:00:23] there's a move on
[1:00:26] there's a spiritual moving on and god is
[1:00:30] testifying that i haven't lost my power
[1:00:35] you lost the vision of it
[1:00:38] because the bible say jesus christ is
[1:00:41] the same
[1:00:43] not what are he going to be but his his
[1:00:46] power is yet the same as it was then how
[1:00:51] do you know could i have seen it
[1:00:54] and seeing it taking place
[1:00:59] it was always good to look back when
[1:01:02] way back when right
[1:01:05] no now
[1:01:08] present tense
[1:01:10] that's what we ought to see
[1:01:14] but i know you're gonna take god and
[1:01:15] servant of god said here
[1:01:18] he says
[1:01:20] i'm wondering
[1:01:22] today that
[1:01:26] what is happening
[1:01:31] are we really getting the people
[1:01:34] to god oh we are
[1:01:37] just getting them to church
[1:01:41] we must that's what he said
[1:01:45] we must get them to christ
[1:01:49] where this quickening power is
[1:01:53] it's good to go to church sure
[1:01:56] if that as far as we go
[1:01:58] it's not far enough
[1:02:02] when you come to church that's good but
[1:02:05] go on to christ
[1:02:09] see come the church but when you come to
[1:02:12] church go on to christ
[1:02:20] do we come to church for anyhow one now
[1:02:24] see you have to have a purpose that we
[1:02:26] come in not just as a
[1:02:29] a ritual or tradition
[1:02:32] no but we're coming because we're
[1:02:34] expecting something
[1:02:38] that's how it used to be with us we
[1:02:40] we're coming i believe some of us still
[1:02:42] there we we're looking for something to
[1:02:46] happen
[1:02:50] and that's the way we ought to come
[1:02:52] expecting god lord if not today lord
[1:02:56] maybe the next day
[1:02:59] but what god is doing he want to get
[1:03:02] your desires
[1:03:05] you must have lord create a desire in me
[1:03:10] god that i can get this quickening power
[1:03:16] i'm gonna tell you something
[1:03:19] for what is coming
[1:03:25] we don't get prepared now
[1:03:28] and if you don't get that quicker than
[1:03:30] power the keeper
[1:03:33] the one that'll keep you and nothing
[1:03:35] else can
[1:03:38] the one that can come and see about you
[1:03:41] in the midnight hours
[1:03:44] when nobody else know what you're going
[1:03:46] through god can come
[1:03:50] when you're so burdened are so troubled
[1:03:53] nobody can help you
[1:03:56] because this is a inner fixing
[1:04:02] i believe if we get the inside fix right
[1:04:06] it'll work itself out
[1:04:10] but we are so interested in
[1:04:13] the outward
[1:04:15] and the intimate man
[1:04:17] is perishing
[1:04:23] oh my david said like this he said i was
[1:04:26] glad when they said unto me
[1:04:32] let us go into the why because david
[1:04:35] knew that if i can get into the presence
[1:04:37] of god something's gonna happen
[1:04:42] yeah i'm troubled and i'm going through
[1:04:44] it and the devil been doing this but if
[1:04:47] i can get to the house of god lord i
[1:04:50] know you got a word for me
[1:04:55] see because god want to meet the needs
[1:04:58] of the people
[1:05:02] god knows we need it
[1:05:06] we need the quickening power
[1:05:09] all these demons everywhere
[1:05:13] we impressing against others you can
[1:05:16] feel these spirits
[1:05:19] what are they doing trying to suck you
[1:05:22] in but thank god you got something in
[1:05:25] you that will shake yourself
[1:05:29] see sometimes you got to pull back
[1:05:32] you can't get entangled in all of this
[1:05:35] nonsense
[1:05:40] because there's too much stuff going on
[1:05:42] that ain't of god
[1:05:45] and that's why the bible said you got to
[1:05:48] learn to encourage
[1:05:50] your own self
[1:05:53] how do you do it
[1:05:56] feed off the word
[1:05:58] come on
[1:05:59] there is something that god got in the
[1:06:02] word that that'll rejuvenize you
[1:06:06] i mean the word will quicken your mother
[1:06:09] body
[1:06:10] did not the bible say when the enemy
[1:06:12] comes in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:06:15] lord are raised up
[1:06:19] i don't know where you ever been low in
[1:06:20] your christian life and you had this
[1:06:22] breaking point like and then god come by
[1:06:27] oh i enjoy it's all right to be in the
[1:06:31] valley and when i get in the valley i
[1:06:33] know i'm going onto the mountaintop
[1:06:36] but god give us valley experiences and
[1:06:39] you will know how to be down but when
[1:06:42] god raised you up
[1:06:46] oh that makes me want to shout
[1:06:50] or the valley
[1:06:52] come on somebody
[1:06:54] it's all right to be in the valley cause
[1:06:57] they know that it's where you'll see god
[1:06:59] at
[1:07:00] daniel was in a valley and all you did
[1:07:04] did not god show up
[1:07:06] meshach had iraq was in the valley did
[1:07:09] not god didn't even take him out
[1:07:13] hallelujah
[1:07:17] god don't take you out of the trials
[1:07:20] but he give you something to go through
[1:07:24] the way you able to say devil
[1:07:29] i'm putting you under
[1:07:31] my feet
[1:07:33] i shall not be moved
[1:07:37] though the tempt this rages i shall not
[1:07:41] be moved
[1:07:43] do a hell assail me brother
[1:07:47] i will not
[1:07:49] don't you rock and no you leave but i'm
[1:07:53] anchored
[1:07:55] you get an anchor interesting god
[1:07:59] my soul is anchored
[1:08:01] my soul is not good
[1:08:04] i say my soul
[1:08:06] is anchored
[1:08:07] in god
[1:08:09] he's a stabilizer
[1:08:12] come on he'll keep you when you can't
[1:08:14] keep yourself
[1:08:17] that's how you really know
[1:08:20] that god keeping you
[1:08:22] because when you get low
[1:08:24] in his flesh
[1:08:26] and your back get against the wall
[1:08:29] and you say lord
[1:08:31] whatever you're doing in the season
[1:08:34] god keep me
[1:08:36] i don't know what to do
[1:08:38] i don't know lord
[1:08:40] what i need to do god but i'm going to
[1:08:41] be still
[1:08:43] because i know you promised i will never
[1:08:46] leave you
[1:08:47] i will never forsake you but i'll be
[1:08:50] with you
[1:08:51] until the end god is with us
[1:08:57] regardless of what we got to deal with
[1:09:00] come on
[1:09:00] every one place i'm going that's forward
[1:09:04] there's no time to run back
[1:09:07] run back to what
[1:09:10] crying
[1:09:12] mama
[1:09:13] where's somebody down
[1:09:16] why cry speak
[1:09:21] see we have must come to a place that we
[1:09:24] know what we got we got the king sword
[1:09:30] oh my
[1:09:33] see we're sitting waiting
[1:09:35] waiting lord i'm waiting on you no no no
[1:09:37] no no god said no i i waiting on you
[1:09:41] because i gave you the promise
[1:09:43] you think god made known all these
[1:09:46] uncertain riches for us to sit here and
[1:09:49] say lord
[1:09:51] god say no
[1:09:52] say it's given to you
[1:09:56] to know what god want done with the word
[1:10:00] see that's what we have grown up
[1:10:03] we're not dilly-dallying around and
[1:10:06] worrying about everything coming
[1:10:08] in this life here y'all things gonna
[1:10:10] happen
[1:10:11] i don't care where you go or what you do
[1:10:15] they ain't gonna happen
[1:10:17] but in that hour you must know
[1:10:20] that's why who david my my prayer always
[1:10:23] like to say i said lord uh let this word
[1:10:26] abide in me
[1:10:28] god you know keep me
[1:10:32] your word is the only thing god that
[1:10:35] that can hold me
[1:10:38] and god let the spirit
[1:10:40] quicken the word that you're giving us
[1:10:44] in other words lord
[1:10:46] make the word come alive in me
[1:10:49] that i can walk worthy
[1:10:53] of the gospel that i'm called
[1:10:57] oh god
[1:11:00] he said i i like his he said it's good
[1:11:03] to come the truth but he said go on from
[1:11:05] the church
[1:11:06] and get to christ
[1:11:09] and that's what we got to get the people
[1:11:10] to understand
[1:11:12] we are glad for you to come to church
[1:11:15] but we want you to go
[1:11:16] into christ
[1:11:19] though very word see
[1:11:22] god want that word to be made alive
[1:11:27] we have heard
[1:11:30] what god had done in this hour
[1:11:33] we many of us can uh court it back
[1:11:36] what's
[1:11:38] we can say but god that's not what it
[1:11:41] need to do it need to be made alive
[1:11:46] because if not
[1:11:47] we'll be just like any other church
[1:11:53] yeah
[1:11:55] because remember israel had a prophet
[1:11:58] they had a prophet too
[1:12:03] when moses came on the scene
[1:12:05] and went to pharaoh and he did those
[1:12:08] super decided they did it too
[1:12:13] and see there are people out there i
[1:12:15] hear uh a testimony of of people's
[1:12:19] ministers and
[1:12:20] doing things and i said lord i i said
[1:12:23] it's simply that
[1:12:25] they are enjoying our bread
[1:12:29] the way we ought to be moving
[1:12:32] the sword of god said we ought to be
[1:12:33] moving in higher heights in christ
[1:12:37] you say but what has happened to us we
[1:12:40] are afraid
[1:12:42] that it won't work
[1:12:45] because we are not spiritual inclined
[1:12:50] to what god wants us to be
[1:12:54] what he's looking for is a super uh um
[1:12:58] i'll be in the message we're working on
[1:13:00] that the stats of a perfect man
[1:13:03] prophet god said what i'm trying to do
[1:13:05] here is establish a powerhouse church
[1:13:10] and he knew it it just can't be the
[1:13:12] letter of the word
[1:13:14] the holy ghost has to come and quicken
[1:13:17] that word
[1:13:18] and when that word is quicken in you you
[1:13:21] become a one-man invasion
[1:13:25] the devil is afraid of you i think
[1:13:27] that's the main problem while the devil
[1:13:29] is bothering us like he is because he
[1:13:31] don't want you to catch it
[1:13:34] because once you catch it you will tear
[1:13:37] his kingdom down
[1:13:40] church that's where we ought to be
[1:13:43] we are to be that
[1:13:45] superpower church
[1:13:47] that god is looking for and i want to
[1:13:49] say this god gonna have one
[1:13:53] god gonna have himself that
[1:13:56] i pray that we
[1:13:58] like let's see that song i pray we all
[1:14:01] be ready
[1:14:03] because this this is
[1:14:06] our day
[1:14:08] this is the time where
[1:14:11] god wants to use us
[1:14:16] god bless you
[1:14:28] i appreciate the word tonight
[1:14:31] it said let this mind
[1:14:34] be in you that was also in christ jesus
[1:14:36] who's being in the form of god
[1:14:38] thought and not robbery to be of god but
[1:14:41] made himself of no
[1:14:43] reputation
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:46] i want to say amen
[1:14:48] we appreciate the word tonight i
[1:14:51] that's some things that i wrote down and
[1:14:54] and
[1:14:55] i was listening to
[1:14:57] brother palmer he was going over those
[1:14:59] things
[1:15:00] some things i was speaking in mullins
[1:15:02] last night and he was going over those
[1:15:04] things
[1:15:06] and i said this is the season
[1:15:08] that god wants
[1:15:10] us to have that kind of mind not to
[1:15:13] think
[1:15:14] more highly of ourselves than we ought
[1:15:16] to think
[1:15:17] but he said to think sovereignly
[1:15:20] you know i think sometimes people think
[1:15:22] more highly than they ought to think
[1:15:23] think that they're further up the road
[1:15:25] than they are
[1:15:27] and he said not to think of ourselves
[1:15:29] more highly than we ought to think
[1:15:32] and i said lord what happened people are
[1:15:35] thinking that they're at a hike as
[1:15:38] brother palmer say people are saying
[1:15:40] that i'm here i'm here i'm here and he
[1:15:42] says where's the power where's the
[1:15:44] vindication
[1:15:45] so tonight i agree with brother palmer
[1:15:47] we need to amen not to talk about what
[1:15:50] we are but are we positionally placed in
[1:15:53] christ where we need to be
[1:15:55] and if we are then where is the power
[1:15:59] amen
[1:16:00] praise god because it's not in word only
[1:16:03] but in power
[1:16:06] god you know i constantly say god is
[1:16:08] doing more
[1:16:09] now than he ever did in ministry but
[1:16:12] people are saying god is doing more yet
[1:16:14] they seem to be far away from the word
[1:16:18] and they're saying the same thing i'm
[1:16:20] saying
[1:16:21] i said oh god they're saying the same
[1:16:23] thing
[1:16:25] but not walking in
[1:16:27] in the wiring
[1:16:29] not living what
[1:16:31] was written
[1:16:33] but yet they got the same testimony so
[1:16:35] you can't testify
[1:16:37] they're going to testify you
[1:16:39] that's why brother palmer said it would
[1:16:41] i tend to work the children bread look
[1:16:44] like they got it
[1:16:45] and the people that supposed to have it
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:49] the prophet said the the the sickest
[1:16:51] people is the church it's supposed to be
[1:16:53] the believer
[1:16:56] that's the sickest body
[1:16:59] amen and it ought to be the oh god god
[1:17:02] bless you i don't want to mess with that
[1:17:05] god is good amen
[1:17:07] want to pray for uh brother ernest he's
[1:17:10] had a religious reaction so he's in the
[1:17:13] hospital and he'll be out hopefully
[1:17:15] tomorrow by the grace of god and
[1:17:17] just lift him up in your prayers
[1:17:20] and we thank god we're still praying for
[1:17:23] sister dale and
[1:17:24] grace and different ones but god is good
[1:17:27] amen

[1:17:34] somebody said he works in mysterious
[1:17:36] ways
[1:17:37] oneness to perform
[1:17:40] you know god can be speaking in a lot of
[1:17:42] different ways but whether or not we
[1:17:44] listened to him
[1:17:46] and said god what are you saying
[1:17:50] you speaking lord
[1:17:52] but we got to say here am i

[1:18:53] glory of god was in the church amen
