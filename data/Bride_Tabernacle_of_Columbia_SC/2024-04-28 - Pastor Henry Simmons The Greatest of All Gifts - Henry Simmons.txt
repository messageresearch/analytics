we need your help God meet every need according to your riches and Glory but Lord we thank you now Lord may you bless your word in Jesus name amen backing up a little bit we were talking about the greatest gift and that which is perfect has come amen that which is perfect has come we'll start at the 15 and one I read the first you read the next and and we'll read through the 13th verse St John 15 And1 I am the True Vine my father is the husband too now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you for I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing six a if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you eight as the father has loved me so have I love you continue ye in my love 10 these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full 12 together greater love has no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friend God bless you read for you may be seated the 14th verse says ye are my friends if ye do what soever I command you he said henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friend for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you so by the grace of God God I want to we said on last Sunday that which when that which is perfect is come and then that which is in part should be done away with isn't that right so it was thres throughout if if you ever studied the message of the hour the theme of it is love amen if you study the Bible the Bible tells us about about the love of God coming to us amen amen so we said the greatest of all gifts 1 Corinthians 13 and uh 1 Corinthians 13 and the the last verse he says now abided Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of all of these is what love amen now we said the without the love of God Amen see to abide in God he said except you abide in me my word abide in you to abide in him is to abide in his love once we get out of the love of God once we be conduct Our Lives outside of the love of God then he says if a man abideth not in me he's no good he's just to be burnt in the fire I'm the vine ye the branches amen if we don't stay connected the only way we're going to stay connected with God is to stay in the love of God the only way we're going to have the love of God is we have the Holy Ghost now we can have love for one another for family and for friends and but to have the love of God in our hearts is a goday love that's God's love the greatest of all gifts though I have faith hope and charity but he said the greatest is charity is love now in St John I I guess I better stay here in Corinthians it's a lot of things that are done and I'm going tell you the devil he hates God he does not like God he hates to see you love one another he despise said in the Sunday school this morning one of the characteristics of Lucifer when he was lifted up in his heart is pride we were talking about the elect cannot be deceived what what makes you elect and what makes you not impossible to deceive you it came real strong to me you know in pray sometimes we see you feel so secure cuz God sent a prophet and we have have a message that has called us out of the denominational world and called us out of mystery Babylon and we know that denominationalism is is not of God an organized religion and so forth but what we fail to understand that that would not deceive us we understand that he said for the elect's sake God shorten the days are you with me the deception is going when Lucifer decided that he had something in his heart he was lifted up in his pride we talked about all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the what pride of life pride of life Pride I will Ascend above the stars of God I will be like the I I think brother Gerald say it's a selfish spirit it's a selfish Spirit people are selfish we're born to be selfish we're born Amen to be proudful proud of my family I'm proud of my children I'm proud sometimes that's all right you saying you know I'm thankful in other words and we might use proud I'm thankful to God that God has blessed my family and I'm proud to see him do the right thing and live the right kind of way and so forth I really sometimes I tell my children I'm really really really proud of you the choices that you make I thank God for your choices that you make the right choices and decision thank God for you am now it's a different type of Pride that Lucifer had he wanted to am me to lift himself up we talking about the greatest of all gift is the love but what we what what what what we seeing there's a constant war and a battle going on because Lucifer in himself wanted to exalt himself are you with me this flesh wanted to exalt itself itself above God above the word of God above the Revelation that God has given you and I in the hour we live in am the devil will allow himself to be exalted above the stars of God but the greatest of all gifts brother and sisters one of the character Riches of the devil is we call it the fire seated religion that we must be careful of the spirit of the Pharisees they said we have Abraham of our father and they believed in Miracles and they believe in the resurrection and Sadducees didn't believe in angels in the resurrection and so forth but the Pharisees they believed in that angels and they believed in the resurrection and so forth but here the Pharisees had such a SP proud spirit such a religious spirit that when Jesus came to them they thought that they were inly out of seal they said that we have a am we're rich we increase the good we don't need you they saw no need of God because they had their own Revelation they were Pharisees they had it all if you were of God then you would actually be a Pharisee you see and if he was a aen if if you were spiritual you would want to be a Pharisee Pharisees they thought they had it and lay out of seal the people be rich increasing good and they said I have need of nothing the deception of this age is to feel so self secure you know I was on my knes friend this morning I said you know something when we didn't have much we didn't worry about a thing we didn't worry about protecting it losing it now we take we'll work two or three job we work overtime and every kind of time we can get to try to keep the love that we got but we didn't have much man we get on our KNE cried to God love God all but when we get a little something we do everything we can do to try to what hold on to that little something and who's who's lacking spiritually materially we have it spiritually we lost it and on my knees this morning it's I looked at um Hosea says in Hosea 6 and and I said Lord you know something in my spirit was saying I said God we've gotten so rich and increasing Goods to where is the love of God where is our love for God the things of this world and the things that we possess have blinded us we're doing so much to try to hold on and try to get a little bit more of what we got that we don't L the most the thing that the greatest thing and that is to have the love of God in our heart it says in Hebrews I mean Hosea 6 And1 it said come let us what and I said Lord I I I can hear the spirit inside of me and I said Lord oh god what happened what happened I I was looking at this age and what we live in the time that we living in the greatest of all gifts is missing in the church amen the greatest thing is missing Amen in the lives of the people amen when God would be first not families first husband is first wife is first job is first God ain't first no more oh I don't mean to be fussing at you I sound a little strong let me catch myself I don't even fussing but I want you to understand that God wants to be first amen he wants to be the utmost thing in your life is because it's the greatest of all gift the Bible said greater love has no man endur that he gain his life the lay on his life for us that's great love and the Bible tells us even while we were yet enemies in our mind with Wicked work Christ died for the ungodly are you with me regardless of how we were but hey we're more worried about our material your things then we're worried about our spiritual lacking the Bible say we be blind naked poor and [Music] miserable but he said I cancel you The Bu me gold Godly character I want you to buy some Godly character come on I want you to have the greatest gift I want you to have the love of God am amen I want you to love God Amen abide in me amen if you abide in my love amen if you continue in my love amen we've lost the love of God we've lost sight but he said return unto me if you return unto me Hosea Israel had gotten in bad shape Hosea said return unto the Lord I don't know about you I said Lord on my knees I said I'm I'm returning I'm coming back to those good old days sacrifice is a great but I don't mind sacrificing because I love him said it it's coming time again that God can accept your sacrifice cuz you're returning get some our have that you might see spiritually spiritually we trying to hold on spiritually we trying to just do enough do just enough to make ourselves feel all right but he said return unto the Lord come on back the greatest of all gifts is love love it's aike as brother Fred said the love of in the last said the love of many shall wax cold the love of many go whes cold our love for God is not what it ought to be if we get upset with the preacher of anybody come tell us we don't have God first we get upset we get mad we're angry and we won't even come to Church like we ought to why because we got other stuff that God is sick of it am he's sick and tired of our arrogant Spirit our religious spirit return unto me the greatest gift is Miss we're overlooking Jesus we're overlooking the love of God and we love our family more come on somebody we love our our family and and our friends more than we love God and God is looking at us what the greatest of all gifts is being put in the corner we do him any kind of way and we expect for him to accept it brother and sister I came to a point I said Lord I got to get out I got to get I got to do more I got to pray more I got to fast more I got I come out of it and I said Lord I I'm missing out I I haven't been doing what I used to do I got to repent I got to pray more I got to do more God I want to do I want to please you Lord I felt conviction strike me I felt my heart saying Lord I want to do more amen I thought about how many revivals can I preach I was telling Caleb you know I want to go right to Trinidad and Guyana and all those places and then some hit my heart What About around here can you have revivals in South Carolina instead of going to Louisiana and Texas and all over the place I said God you know said this help folk need help right around here can you do some Revival people are to tired we Revival me then don't work me so hard oh Lord I work so hard slave slave master he rely putting a whole lot on us now you know why we got so much on us cuz we want more when we were satisfied with just a letter we were all right I got a car at home ain't drove in a while I getting rid of it I'm getting rid of that car paying in on ain't nobody driving it I got to get rid of Brother G I said Lord have mercy well that c sitting there I'm paying hiss and all of that on that car I getting rid of the car who need a car don't to raise your hand he raised his hand he got it I said Lord need a battery you some sometime we got you got to check ourself up we holding on to stuff we a I I mean Lord have mercy if you need nothing he give you nothing are you with me but we trying we we're leing and we're wearing ourselves out and yet it ain't for God amen amen this these things that got are so busy amen but God has been and that's what Le sea was all about it was a material game Not only was their material gain but there was also spiritual Pride because they they they they didn't it wasn't because they weren going to church amen they were going to church they were serving the lord but God wasn't first and when Jesus come low and meat and he came to the church came to his own his own what re why because they didn't need him their religious spirit had already replaced him they were Pharisees and they said I read your Bible Jesus I got Abraham yeah read your Bible but they couldn't they failed to recognize the need of Jesus in their life the need of the Messiah even though they said they were worshiping God but the god that they said they was worshiping was standing there in front of them they didn't recognize him the Messiah that they were looking for was right there with them the very God that we amen are supposed to be serving praise God is lacking why what has blinded you what has made you so rich that you don't put God first amen the greatest of all gifts love you know I said I wouldn't have no trouble in a lot of areas and that aspects of your life most trouble we have because of a lack of love not love I people say well let's do this let's do this for the young people let's do this for the the middle class people let's do this oh let's do that I said God we can scheme and get everything together and do a whole lot of stuff uh amen let's just have a get some hip hop and rap in the Church let's do something and get the youth involved get a basketball team and a baseball team and let's get a youth camp and all of that but let's get God we trying to program ourselves to Heaven amen amen it ain't programming yourself to Heaven you just need to repent am am amen hallelujah amen the Bible said they don't L by the spirit of God they are the sons of God God wants you to be Sons and Daughters of him amen God I said that's what I want Lord that's what I want I want to get a hold of you I want your will to be done Lord I want to please you Lord I I don't want to please myself I want to please God sometime we don't care what God think about it we just doing what we want we don't care about what God feel about how he feels God I just do what I want take it or leave it you know I'm doing what I want he said without me huh without me you can what you can do what nothing tell some somebody Shake somebody hand say without God you can do nothing not even wake yourself up are you with me now we doing everything we forgetting about God give us the strength and the ability we forgetting about him right he said without me you can do nothing well we we doing what we want to do right but we don't understand that God has given us life health and strength amen amen and without him we can do nothing amen nothing at all but why said me and brother Max said nothing at all you can't do nothing at all so by the grace of God the love of God do you love him enough to give him you all he says in here in Hosea come let us return to the Lord for he has torn and he will what he us you want to be healed he will heal us he has smitten and he will what and after two days will he revive us are you with me and in the third day he was what rais us up and we shall what live in his sight live in his sight then shall we what if we what follow on to know the Lord amen amen it's going forth is what and he shall come to us as the what as the rain as the what the latter in the former rain into the Earth amen don't you need the rain Lord rain I need rain praise God sometimes our spirit is like a desert our soul need water amen we need God in our lives we need the love of God we need the power of God we need the demonstration I'm not worried about what folks know but do you know him because God is love everyone that love is is born of God Amen but we can't we can have that aili your love and not that God pay love amen not that we can we can be sincerely wrong amen amen somebody said the road the road to hell is paid with good intentions amen we intend to do the right thing we got good intentions but we don't do amen amen it it won't get you to heaven when you got good intentions I intended to get right I intended to do right the road to hell is paid with good intention but the way to heaven is already been made plan all you got to do is accept the love of God all you got to do receive Lord You Love Me amen you are willing to help me you willing to forgive me of my sins you was the fing with your spirit yes God you oh I need help am praise God I need help I don't I don't mind brother Isaac this morning he said he said I'm here because I need him that was his remarks for the Sunday school class this morning I'm here because I need the Lord I said are we serving God because we don't want to go to hell are we serving God because we love him some folk come to church and if it was no hell they wouldn't be here but because they heard about a hell but we're serving God because think majority it said because I love him come on if you if you want to get out of a bad marriage because there's no love in the marriage I find out I America's man and I don't love so what it do they be running for their life but I said I I will I do but I don't love them you're in a bad marriage isn't that right you in the church but you don't love God because he said if you love me do what oh Hallelujah are you up me amen but here we are I love you oh that's just a Persona that just you know putting on the ACT amen but folk love the alcohol they love the The Joint they love that woman that man more than they love God Amen if you love the world more than you love God you cannot love to what you can't love to master you either love the one and hate the other now you make the decision whether you love the greater of all gifts is love do you have the love of God in your heart do you believe that he's done enough for you and he will oh Lord I think I
