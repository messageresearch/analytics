[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] Uh, and it reads, "But I would not have
[39:22] you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
[39:25] them that are asleep, that you sorrow
[39:28] not, even as others which have no hope.
[39:32] For if you believe that Jesus died and
[39:35] rose again, even so much as even so them
[39:39] also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[39:42] with him." For this we say unto you by
[39:46] the word of the Lord, that we which are
[39:48] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[39:51] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[39:53] asleep. For the Lord himself shall
[39:56] descend
[39:57] from heaven with a shout, with the voice
[40:00] of the archangel, with the trump of God,
[40:02] and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[40:05] Then we which are alive and remain shall
[40:07] be caught up together with him in the
[40:10] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. So
[40:13] we shall so shall we ever be with the
[40:17] Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with
[40:19] these words. Amen. God bless the reading
[40:22] of this word. You may be seated.
[40:28] Amen. This morning I like to speak on a
[40:30] little topic that I entitled rapturing
[40:33] faith. Rapturing faith. And and it was
[40:36] something that I started to the Lord
[40:38] started to deal with me with and I and I
[40:40] thought about this scripture to be
[40:42] raptured means to be caught up. And I
[40:45] and I thought about it. I said, you
[40:46] know, we have to get to a time and a
[40:48] period in God that we have rapturing
[40:51] faith. That we have the faith that we
[40:53] can believe that God is going to change
[40:55] our body. That we have the faith that we
[40:57] can believe that God is going to do a
[40:59] transformation unlike any transformation
[41:01] we've ever seen, heard, or thought of.
[41:03] that we come to the point that we can
[41:05] live in this life one day and be in
[41:07] heaven the next. That we come to the
[41:10] point that we got a understanding that
[41:12] God is is greater than we can even
[41:15] think.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; That is we can even imagine or even
[41:18] fathom God wants to take us to such a
[41:21] level in faith that we can be translated
[41:23] out of here.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; So that we can be transitioned right on
[41:26] just like Enoch and walk straight into
[41:28] heaven. See, that's how close we have to
[41:31] get to God at this time. And I was
[41:33] thinking about we look at the conditions
[41:35] of the world right now. We were talking
[41:37] about it in Sunday school this morning.
[41:39] How as you look at the different things
[41:41] that's taking a place in the in the
[41:43] political realm and the in the country
[41:45] and the as the Bible says the wars and
[41:47] the rumors of wars and and we seeing
[41:50] that these countries, they're doing many
[41:51] different things and this one's
[41:53] overtaking this one and this one's
[41:55] shooting missiles at this one. and these
[41:57] things are happening and it's just
[41:59] lining up with the scripture to fulfill
[42:01] what time we're living in.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And if it's lining up with the
[42:04] scripture, then we have to get in line
[42:06] with God wants us to be.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; We can't be here and just coming to
[42:10] church and going through the motions or
[42:11] read our Bible here and there. We got to
[42:13] get in God and really get down the
[42:15] depths with God so that we can get that
[42:17] rapturing faith. So that we can get down
[42:20] and say, "Lord, I want to have the faith
[42:22] that I can believe that you can
[42:23] translate me right on out of here. that
[42:25] you can move me from this dimension into
[42:27] that dimension and I won't have to worry
[42:29] about this world no more.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; I started thinking about it and I said,
[42:33] you know, even examining myself and say,
[42:35] I got a ways to go, Lord. Lord, I if if
[42:39] you was to come, would I be ready?
[42:41] Pastor asked that in the in Tuesday
[42:43] night Bible study the other week. Are
[42:45] you ready to meet the Lord? And you got
[42:47] to think about it because that's a
[42:48] realization that you got to have with
[42:50] yourself.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; That's a conversation that you got to
[42:53] have with yourself. Lord, if you come
[42:55] for me, am I ready? Lord, if you come
[42:57] right now, am I striving to do what you
[42:59] want me to do? Lord, am I focused
[43:01] totally on you so that when you come for
[43:04] me, you can say, "Lord, I was about my
[43:06] father's business. I was about doing
[43:09] what you asked me to do and what you led
[43:11] me to do. Lord, I was about working on
[43:13] my faith so that you can take me out of
[43:15] here. That's what I got to be working
[43:17] on. Cuz all of this ain't going to
[43:19] matter. the job, the money, the fame,
[43:22] everything. It's not going to matter if
[43:24] you don't make it in. Said he got
[43:26] promises of great things that's over
[43:28] there for us. I was reading the
[43:30] scripture and I started thinking about
[43:31] it in John chapter 14 where he said, "He
[43:34] got a mansion for me. I'm looking for
[43:36] this house and that house and God got a
[43:38] mansion for me greater than I could even
[43:40] imagine or think about how beautiful
[43:42] that city is." And I'm thinking and I
[43:45] started saying, "You know what? I don't.
[43:47] The prophet of God said you don't want
[43:49] to be left behind.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; That's one thing that you don't want to
[43:52] do. You don't want to be left behind.
[43:54] And if you aren't making preparations,
[43:56] I'm sorry to tell you, you going to get
[43:58] left behind.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; If you're not doing what God told you to
[44:01] do, you going to get left behind.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; If you're not giving your life to the
[44:05] Lord when you know to do better, you
[44:07] hear the word and you know to do better.
[44:09] You will get left behind.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; We can't put you in there. We can't talk
[44:13] you in there. We can't convince you that
[44:15] you're going when you're not. It's
[44:17] better for us to tell you the truth. If
[44:19] you don't get right with God, you're not
[44:21] going where he is. Cuz no sin can get in
[44:24] there. No, no one that's lying a
[44:27] cheater, adulterer, you can't get in
[44:29] there.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; You got to have a cleansing out of your
[44:32] life over here to try to go over there.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; So, if you got stuff that you need to
[44:37] get right with God, now is the time to
[44:39] get right with God. You need to work on
[44:41] it. Said, "Lord, help my unbelief. Lord,
[44:44] help me to increase my faith." I was
[44:47] thinking about the scripture and I
[44:48] thought about it. I said, you know,
[44:49] faith workketh is patience.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; And I thought about it. I said, "Well,
[44:53] if you're working on your patience, just
[44:54] ask God to increase your faith."
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Because when you say, "God, Lord,
[44:58] increase my faith." It'll work on your
[45:00] patience.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; It allowed you to become more patience
[45:02] because you'll realize, "I got to wait
[45:04] on you, God. Lord, I got to wait on you.
[45:07] Lord, I'm still waiting on you." And
[45:08] sometime you pray the prayer and have to
[45:10] see years before God manifest the prayer
[45:12] that you done prayed.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Well, the time is getting shorter that
[45:16] we might not have years before it comes.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; You got to say, Lord, hey, listen, Lord,
[45:21] I know you got a time and I know you got
[45:23] a thing and I know you ain't never lost
[45:25] one, but Lord, it would be nice to see
[45:27] it come forth in this time period. It
[45:30] would be nice. And so, he said, "Lord,
[45:32] I'm coming to you with a direct prayer."
[45:35] I was listening to the to the radio one
[45:37] time and I was listening I might have
[45:39] told it and this guy they was asking
[45:42] they they was having a prayer line on
[45:44] the radio and this and he was asking he
[45:46] said when he was asking people to call
[45:49] in and they said okay what do you want
[45:51] from God and we going to pray and ask
[45:53] the Lord to to do it and when he said
[45:56] when and when he did it I was listening
[45:58] this person and this person called in
[46:00] and you know I'm thinking about Lord
[46:02] well what I want you to do and so
[46:04] Because you know it's those moments like
[46:07] that. You never know what prayer get
[46:08] answered.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; And I said, listen, hey, it's just
[46:11] increasing my faith that somebody is in
[46:13] agreement with me in this moment.
[46:15] Whether it's the person on the street or
[46:17] the man that's sitting in the pool pit
[46:18] or anywhere else, if they got faith to
[46:20] believe that it can be possible and all
[46:23] I have to do is believe with them. Hey,
[46:25] listen y'all. There's some people
[46:26] outside that got more than you cuz they
[46:28] got the faith to believe that it's
[46:29] possible for them. Amen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about it and this
[46:32] person that she got on there, many
[46:34] people was, "Lord, I want to bless with
[46:36] the house." She said, this person got
[46:37] on, "I want a three bedroomedroom, three
[46:40] bathroom." She knew exactly what she
[46:42] wanted God to do.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; And I said, you know, sometimes I got to
[46:46] get more specific with what I'm praying
[46:48] for. I got to get more specific and
[46:50] believing that God is going to give me
[46:52] exactly what I asked him for if that's
[46:54] what I have a need of. And she had a
[46:57] need of it. She said, "I got family. I
[46:59] got children. this is why I need this.
[47:01] And when she went, she had a specific
[47:03] prayer and I it came to me right then. I
[47:05] said, you know, sometimes we go to God
[47:07] as he says in the scripture, we ask a
[47:09] miss.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; We ask for the wrong thing so God don't
[47:12] give it to us.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; So, so when you go to God, you got to
[47:16] say, "Lord, I have a need. This is what
[47:18] I need. Lord, I need you to increase my
[47:20] faith.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need you to build my faith.
[47:23] Lord, Lord, however you decide to build
[47:25] it, Lord, I need you to increase it so I
[47:27] can get to the point to get up out of
[47:29] here
[47:31] &gt;&gt; to believe that I can translate from
[47:33] this to this level to the next level,
[47:35] then go all the way up till I reach your
[47:37] throne.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; See, that's where I'm trying to get cuz
[47:40] this life it doesn't matter.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; You have to live this life. You have to
[47:44] work and do the things that God has for
[47:47] you to do. And you have to go about and
[47:49] say, "Lord, how do I go about your
[47:50] business for my life?" Each one of us
[47:53] got a different journey. All of our
[47:54] journeys is not going to be the same.
[47:56] Two people that come up in the same
[47:58] house going to have a different journey.
[48:00] But when God calls you, heed to the
[48:02] call.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; When God s comes to your door and knocks
[48:06] on your door, open up the door because
[48:08] you might not you might not get another
[48:10] opportunity to open up that door
[48:12] tomorrow.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow isn't promised to you. Tomorrow
[48:16] is Many times we think, you know, I'm
[48:18] young. I'm strong. I'm going to be able
[48:20] to continue. I'll give it to the Lord
[48:22] maybe next week, next year, you know,
[48:24] but guess what? We might not see another
[48:26] year.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; If they start a war, hey, well, you
[48:30] listen, some of us under draft agent,
[48:33] you'll be right there.
[48:36] So, hey, that's all. It's an honest
[48:39] thing.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; If they go back to a draft, some of us
[48:43] in that rage range, they say, "Come on,
[48:44] we going to take you." Then you going to
[48:46] try to find God
[48:48] &gt;&gt; real quick. be like, "Lord, please don't
[48:50] send me." You going to get down on your
[48:52] knees quicker than you ever have in your
[48:54] life because you don't want to go see
[48:56] that.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; You don't want to go near that. You
[48:58] don't want to be in that place where
[49:00] they're going to have these things and
[49:02] you're going to be like, "Lord have
[49:03] mercy. What have we come to?"
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; What have this world come to and you
[49:08] understand and you start to see the
[49:10] things that maybe our forefathers might
[49:12] have seen in years past. And just think
[49:16] about a nuclear war. If they ever decide
[49:18] that that's what they want to go to,
[49:19] it's going to get there one day. It's
[49:22] going to get there. Many times I pray, I
[49:24] said, "Lord, we know that the wrath is
[49:26] coming, but Lord, in wrath, remember
[49:27] mercy.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, in wrath, remember mercy." Because
[49:31] Lord, I don't want to see them bombs
[49:33] drop. I want to be gone.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; That that that that's where I want to
[49:37] be. That I've gotten it. And I was
[49:39] thinking I said, you know, I was I wrote
[49:41] it down. I said, "How many times have we
[49:43] gotten to the point that we're hindering
[49:45] our faith?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; We want rapturing faith, but we don't
[49:49] want to get our life right.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; We want we want God to do these things,
[49:54] but we don't want to do what he told us
[49:55] to do.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; We don't want to lay aside this weight
[49:58] and lay aside that weight and put this
[50:00] behind us and put that one behind us and
[50:02] walk by ourselves sometimes cuz that's
[50:05] what God requires of us."
[50:07] said, "How many of us want God to do
[50:09] these things, but we don't want to get
[50:10] rid of the stuff so God can do the
[50:12] thing?" So, we blocking God from even
[50:14] blessing us.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; We're blocking God from even moving in
[50:19] our lives because we got stuff that we
[50:21] don't want to let go.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; We got rooms that we don't want God to
[50:26] go in because we got some things that we
[50:28] want to keep in on.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; I said many of times we want to get and
[50:33] and then you think that you going to
[50:34] heaven with that. Come on. Listen.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; You can't take it to heaven.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; That's why he wants you to say, David
[50:41] said, "Lord, create in me a clean heart
[50:43] and renew a right spirit within me." Cuz
[50:46] David realized, "Hey, Lord, I'm just a
[50:48] sinner saved by your grace." So, the
[50:50] only way that I make it is, Lord, you
[50:52] forgive me from what I've gone through
[50:54] and what I've done because there's no
[50:56] other way for me to make it.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; That's why God called him a man after
[51:01] his own heart. Cuz David was quick to
[51:03] repent and say, "Lord, that's me." Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't point to this one or that one
[51:07] and said, you know, you're the root of
[51:09] my problem and you're the root of my
[51:10] problem and Lord, you're the reason why
[51:12] I'm this way and mama the reason why I
[51:14] don't like going to church or this one
[51:16] or that one
[51:18] &gt;&gt; now. Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; It's about your personal relationship
[51:21] with God for yourself.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Whether you get it outside, get it in
[51:25] the church, you need to have your own
[51:27] personal relationship deep down in the
[51:30] closet on your knees. said, "Lord, hey,
[51:33] I got to get a real relationship with
[51:35] you because if you don't, I won't make
[51:37] it."
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Said, "Many of times, you going to hear
[51:41] the words like brother Ernest was saying
[51:43] the other night. It's going to be the
[51:44] words that you heard that's going to
[51:45] judge you."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; It's going to be the words that somebody
[51:48] tried to tell you to go the right way
[51:50] and you said, "You know what? I'm good.
[51:52] I got next week to do it.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[51:55] &gt;&gt; I got next month to do it. I got next
[51:58] year to do it. I'm good right now. this
[52:00] this is fine. Coming to church is just
[52:02] fine. You know, that's enough saving for
[52:04] me.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe once a week. Some people they
[52:08] satisfied with that. But when you get
[52:10] there, will God be satisfied with it?
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Will God be satisfied you could just
[52:15] come to church every Sunday?
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Was that enough God for you to get all
[52:19] the way to heaven?
[52:21] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes we think that, hey, I I
[52:23] read the daily scripture. That's enough
[52:25] for me.
[52:27] But you see, he said those that hunger
[52:29] and thirst after the righteousness, they
[52:31] shall be filled. See, you got to have
[52:34] something. When you really get hungry
[52:35] for something, you ain't aid in a day or
[52:38] two. For some of us, it take a couple of
[52:40] days, but for some of us, it take 15
[52:42] minutes. And when you really get hungry,
[52:46] sometimes whatever was in the cabinet
[52:48] that you thought didn't look of
[52:50] appetizing, decided, hey, you know what?
[52:53] I can I can make do with this because
[52:55] it's the middle of the night. Ain't no
[52:57] stores open, but I'm hungry. So you
[53:00] trying to you you try to concoct
[53:02] something because you get hungry. And
[53:04] see, that's the way God wants you to
[53:06] come after him in this hour. Lord, I'm
[53:08] hungry and I want more.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm hungry and I want more. Lord,
[53:12] I'm not satisfied with where I was
[53:13] yesterday. I'm not satisfied with where
[53:16] I was last week. I'm not satisfied with
[53:18] where I was last year. Lord, I got to go
[53:20] to a higher place in you. Cuz Lord, I'm
[53:23] trying to make it in.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I'm trying to I want to see you
[53:28] build my faith and build my faith and
[53:30] build my faith till I get to the point
[53:31] that you can rapture me on out of here.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; See, I I'm trying to get to that point.
[53:36] And Lord, if I don't get down and get a
[53:38] life with you, GET A PRAYER life with
[53:39] you, I never get to that point.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; See, it's got to have a transition to
[53:44] somebody that get desperate with God and
[53:46] say, "Lord, I want to make it in. Lord,
[53:49] I want to make it in. Lord, I want to
[53:51] let all these things go and I want to
[53:52] make it in.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; I got to turn away from all the other
[53:56] things that's distracting me and put my
[53:58] sole focus on you, Lord.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; See, you got to get to that point that
[54:04] you're no longer I said I was going to
[54:06] minister on the mustard seed, but
[54:08] sometimes you got to become the full
[54:09] tree.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; You can't stay a mustard seed.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Many people, they
[54:14] got mustard seed faith, but they never
[54:16] grow from the mustard seed. They got
[54:17] they just like the man with the one
[54:19] talent. That's all they got.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; They never planted it in the ground to
[54:23] see if it would sprout. They never
[54:25] planted it in the ground to see if it
[54:27] would grow. And then when they Some
[54:29] people they plant it but they don't
[54:30] water it.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Some people they plant it, they water it
[54:33] and then they get to a certain point and
[54:35] then they start clipping it.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; They clip the top out of it so it can
[54:39] only grow so far cuz that's all the
[54:41] height that they want that tree to grow.
[54:44] But when you really start to get it, you
[54:45] said, "Lord, I want it to grow to the
[54:47] full maturation of what it's supposed to
[54:49] be."
[54:51] &gt;&gt; And if it's the full maturation of what
[54:53] it's supposed to be, that faith is
[54:55] supposed to grow into rapturing faith.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; That's what that faith is supposed to
[55:00] turn into. Till you get to the point
[55:02] that God can come and say, "Boo, and you
[55:04] gone."
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Just like the moment in a twinkle of an
[55:07] eye, he going to call your name. You
[55:08] going to get up like Lazarus, just go
[55:11] &gt;&gt; and just transition right into the point
[55:13] that you here. You're here today and
[55:15] gone tomorrow.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; So, one might be lying in your bed and
[55:18] the other one to be taken.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; See, that's the that's the type where
[55:21] you get to that point that God has
[55:23] transitioned you to a level that you got
[55:25] the faith to believe that it's possible.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; That you got the faith to believe that
[55:30] God can do these things. Amen.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "So, Prophet God says, "So if
[55:35] our faith can come to that spot after
[55:37] him identifying among us and knows
[55:40] everything that's in our heart and has
[55:42] proved to be to us so that he's alive
[55:45] and confirmed it by the scripture,"
[55:47] he said. See, now that shows that you
[55:50] don't have to just think you're trying
[55:52] to say something that some type of
[55:54] mythical thing. What this Bible has
[55:56] promised, that's the truth. Now, every
[55:58] word is true. Now, it's not it I may not
[56:02] have faith enough to make every word of
[56:04] it act, but I certainly wouldn't stand
[56:07] in the way of anybody that did have that
[56:09] faith. See, Enoch had faith enough one
[56:12] day to take an afternoon stroll with God
[56:14] and just kept on walking. Went up home
[56:17] without dying. Now, I think the church
[56:19] has got to come to that to a rapture in
[56:22] faith. I may not have that faith just
[56:24] now, but I sure sure wouldn't stand in
[56:26] the way of somebody that did have that
[56:28] faith. See, I don't want to be someone
[56:30] that talked about I might not have it. I
[56:32] got to have it. We're no longer living
[56:35] in the time period that we can can
[56:37] depend on I might not have it and still
[56:39] make it. You got to live that every day
[56:42] is the day that the Lord can come back.
[56:44] Tomorrow might be the day that the Lord
[56:46] is coming back. Look, if tomorrow is the
[56:48] day, am I ready to go? If if the next
[56:51] day is the day, am I ready to go? And I
[56:53] got to do what Paul said. I got to die
[56:55] daily because this flesh doesn't want to
[56:58] doesn't want to allow me to get to that
[56:59] point. But at some time I got to crucify
[57:02] the flesh. I got to lay it aside and
[57:04] say, "Lord, take every weight that so
[57:06] beset me." And I lay it aside at your
[57:08] feet and Lord, I'm not picking it up no
[57:10] more.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; See, when you get to that point, it it
[57:14] transitions because you realize what God
[57:17] can do. Because not only do you have the
[57:19] faith to rapture, you have the faith to
[57:21] believe in everything that you need. If
[57:23] the food start coming, you got the faith
[57:25] that God will put it in the
[57:26] refrigerator. If the gas cash gas run
[57:29] out of the tank, you got the faith that
[57:30] God, I'm nowhere near gas station, but
[57:33] you can put some in this tank. Well, so
[57:35] that I can make it to where I need to
[57:36] go. See, that's when you get the RAPTURE
[57:38] IN FAITH. ALL THINGS are possible.
[57:41] People can walk in and believe that they
[57:43] are healed and not have to be touched
[57:45] and and the healing can happen just
[57:47] then. Just like Peter and John when they
[57:49] walked through the shadow healed them.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; It's because they were living in a
[57:53] different type of realm in a different
[57:55] type of faith that when they walked in
[57:57] all things were possible. And when you
[57:59] get to that point, then there be none
[58:02] sick among you. There be you'll start to
[58:04] transition to that level that
[58:06] understanding all the things that God is
[58:08] able and capable of doing.
[58:12] See, that's where I want to get to.
[58:14] Where I can move with power and
[58:15] authority and utilize the things that
[58:18] God said I was supposed to do. I'm
[58:21] living in that hour. I'm living in that
[58:23] season, Lord, that I'm supposed to
[58:24] expect greater things. And if it's
[58:27] greater thing, then I'm supposed to see
[58:29] it with my OWN EYES.
[58:33] AS we live in the day and age that the
[58:35] devil is increasing, the demons are
[58:37] increasing where the POWER OF GOD HAS TO
[58:39] INCREASE TO COMBAT the devil of this
[58:42] age.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; So, that's where I'm trying to get to a
[58:48] rapture in faith that I can move in such
[58:50] a way that there's no more fear. There's
[58:53] only faith. There's no more doubt.
[58:56] There's only faith. There's no more
[58:58] understanding. There's only faith.
[59:00] There's nothing but victory. in victory
[59:02] after victory because even when the
[59:04] devil comes, I know that I have victory.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; See, it's something to those people that
[59:11] get to a certain confidence level in the
[59:13] natural ability that they don't fear
[59:16] anything.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; You ever met someone that's that's not
[59:19] afraid of nothing?
[59:21] &gt;&gt; They will do some things to you be like,
[59:23] "That's absolutely crazy.
[59:26] That's absolutely, and I don't mean to
[59:28] use that word, but it's absolutely
[59:30] mindboggling that you believe that I can
[59:32] jump off this cliff and this little
[59:34] thing going to hold me up and carry me
[59:37] all the way down and I'm going to land
[59:39] in a safe zone.
[59:42] But when people get a certain level of
[59:43] confidence and a certain level of
[59:46] belief, they got to have faith in that
[59:47] parachute that it's going to keep them.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now, now if you really think
[59:52] about it, you just like a cloth wind
[59:57] drop. Yeah, you know, I might decide not
[1:00:00] to do that for my life, but they have a
[1:00:03] confidence that they're not afraid to do
[1:00:06] it. They not afraid. And some people,
[1:00:08] they get trained to a level, but
[1:00:10] sometimes you got to get your mind in
[1:00:12] that space to believe that these things
[1:00:14] are possible.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; And when you get there, you start to
[1:00:18] move with a different action. You start
[1:00:20] to move with a different confidence. You
[1:00:22] start to move. It's not because you're
[1:00:24] moving with things that you believe that
[1:00:26] you can do. It's that you have such a
[1:00:27] faith in God that these things are
[1:00:29] possible. These things are action. These
[1:00:32] things are going to happen. These things
[1:00:34] the blind will see. The he the person
[1:00:36] that needs to hear will be able to hear.
[1:00:38] The will walk. Cancer will be
[1:00:40] like nothing because I believe that God
[1:00:42] will remove it and do the surgeries that
[1:00:44] need to be done within me without the
[1:00:46] doctor doing the thing.
[1:00:48] See, when you get to that level, your
[1:00:50] faith has increased that God can do
[1:00:52] anything. God can do anything. Whatever
[1:00:55] I need, God can do it. GOD CAN do it.
[1:00:58] And I'm not going to stop until I see
[1:01:01] God do it. I'm not going to stop
[1:01:03] doubting till I see God do the thing
[1:01:05] that it becomes a testimony of what God
[1:01:08] can do because it's just going to build
[1:01:10] my faith until I get to the point that
[1:01:12] God can take me out of here. Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; See, it's rapturing faith that we're
[1:01:17] looking for. We're looking for a church
[1:01:19] without spot or wrinkle. See, when they
[1:01:21] get to that point, they're pure.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; When they get to that point, they have
[1:01:25] no spot or wrinkle. That's what God is
[1:01:27] coming back for. Said that you believe
[1:01:29] me so much that I had to bring you home.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; You believe that this thing was going to
[1:01:34] happen. I had to take you out of that
[1:01:36] world. You was no longer of this world.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; See, that's what I'm trying to get to.
[1:01:41] And God is trying to get us to till we
[1:01:43] get to that point that God said, "I got
[1:01:45] to come get you.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; I got to come take you out of here. This
[1:01:48] is not a place that light and darkness
[1:01:50] can be in the same place at the same
[1:01:52] time. So, I got to take the light out of
[1:01:54] this world."
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "It's a it might be to some a
[1:01:59] horrible time to live in, but to some,
[1:02:01] you got to get to the point it's a
[1:02:02] glorious time to live in. It's a time
[1:02:05] that that God is going to do the things
[1:02:07] like we never seen before. God is going
[1:02:10] to make ways like we've never seen
[1:02:12] before. God is going to open doors like
[1:02:14] we've never seen before because he
[1:02:16] promised that greater things would
[1:02:18] happen in this time.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Said the prophet God said, "I want you
[1:02:23] to get built up now." And the holy
[1:02:26] oracles in the faith, the faith of this
[1:02:28] hour, the faith, it's going to take more
[1:02:31] faith than ever was in any age. Said
[1:02:35] it's going to take more faith than ever
[1:02:36] was in any age. But this has to be
[1:02:39] rapturing faith to be taken up. And so
[1:02:42] we want to believe in all that you have
[1:02:45] seen, heard, the word that that you have
[1:02:48] heard preached, the signs and wonders
[1:02:50] that you've seen. We want to accumulate
[1:02:52] all that together in heart and consider
[1:02:54] it whether it be of God or not.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; It's like Elijah of old said, if God be
[1:03:00] God, then serve him.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; See, you got to get to the point that if
[1:03:05] you believe that God is God, If you
[1:03:08] believe that God is God and he's a
[1:03:12] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:03:14] them, you got to believe I don't I don't
[1:03:17] I can step in into a realm of faith that
[1:03:19] I've never experienced before because I
[1:03:21] believe that God is God.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And if he created the world, he can do
[1:03:25] whatever I I need him to do for me.
[1:03:28] Because he said, "Ask and it shall be
[1:03:30] given. If you seek, you shall find."
[1:03:32] See, that's all you got to do sometime
[1:03:35] is step into believing that what I asked
[1:03:37] for God provided. What I asked for and
[1:03:40] what I come to you in sincere heart to
[1:03:42] believe what is poss Lord all I got to
[1:03:44] do is believe it and you'll do it for
[1:03:46] me. Lord, if I need you to save and if I
[1:03:49] need you to heal, if I need you to go
[1:03:51] and resurrect and bring someone back,
[1:03:53] Lord, I send it forth and I expect a
[1:03:55] word to come back cuz you said it can't
[1:03:57] return void.
[1:03:59] He said,
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; he said, "If God be God, then serve
[1:04:04] him." And G, and if Jesus is the center
[1:04:07] of all things to the Christian, then I
[1:04:09] think we ought to let loose of
[1:04:11] everything else and cleave to him.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Remember, he is the center. He is the
[1:04:16] north star. He's the ultimate. He's the
[1:04:19] absolute. And if he is the north star,
[1:04:22] there's only one thing that'll point to
[1:04:23] the north star, and that's your compass
[1:04:26] that you're sailing with. That compass
[1:04:28] that I'm trying trying you to sail with
[1:04:30] is the word and the word will always
[1:04:34] point to him.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; See, you got to get to the point that
[1:04:37] that you have such a relationship that
[1:04:40] Lord, whatever you promise me.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Whatever you promise me, Lord, I'm
[1:04:46] claiming all my promises. I I I I'm not
[1:04:50] doubting no more, Lord. I'm claiming all
[1:04:52] my promises. all every last one of them
[1:04:55] that you promised me. Lord, I'm claiming
[1:04:57] all my promises. Lord, when I step forth
[1:05:00] and I go in this classroom, I know that
[1:05:02] you've given me what I'm supposed to
[1:05:04] have to make it through. Lord, when I go
[1:05:06] to work, and Lord, you know my needs at
[1:05:09] home. You know my bills. Lord, I'm
[1:05:11] expecting. Lord, when I go here, you
[1:05:13] increase the pay. Lord, you know the
[1:05:15] time that I'm living in. You know what I
[1:05:17] need. So, Lord, when I come to you,
[1:05:19] Lord, when I need this job, Lord, I know
[1:05:21] that you're going to supply it for me.
[1:05:22] Cuz when I go into this, Lord, you're
[1:05:24] going to make the way plain and the way
[1:05:26] straight
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; and we feel like we're going through a
[1:05:31] great time of distress and trials.
[1:05:34] Perplexity of the time and distress
[1:05:37] between the nation and all kinds of
[1:05:39] things is happening and sometimes I get
[1:05:42] engulfed like everywhere I look is is in
[1:05:45] a ship out on the sea
[1:05:48] and how we're going to make it.
[1:05:50] Sometimes you might wonder, "How am I
[1:05:52] going to make it?
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; How am I going to get through this? How
[1:05:56] is this world going to come through
[1:05:58] this?" But he but he but he said, "And
[1:06:01] here comes one with a white cap, like
[1:06:04] one of the waves 100 times bigger than
[1:06:06] my ship,
[1:06:08] but we'll crest it." It means that we'll
[1:06:11] make it over this wave. No matter how
[1:06:14] big it is, we're going to make it over
[1:06:16] every last one of them. Cuz we are more
[1:06:19] than victors through him.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; He said the captain, the chief captain,
[1:06:23] he's got a hold of the string on the end
[1:06:26] of the ship and he'll pull it through
[1:06:29] will crest every last one of them. You
[1:06:31] got to get to the point that Lord,
[1:06:33] whatever the waves may bring, whatever
[1:06:35] the wind may come, whatever the waves
[1:06:38] may throw against my ship, Lord, there's
[1:06:40] nothing too big, too hard that you can't
[1:06:43] allow me to come over, that you can't
[1:06:45] provide a way to come through. Cuz I
[1:06:47] believe that you are able. I believe
[1:06:50] that you're able to make a way, a
[1:06:52] position. Lord, you always made a way of
[1:06:54] escape. I'm just waiting on you to show
[1:06:56] me the way. Lord, I'm waiting for you to
[1:06:58] open the door that I can see the way of
[1:07:00] escape. That I can see the way that you
[1:07:02] made through the situation. Lord, I can
[1:07:05] see the way that you provided. Even
[1:07:06] though I don't understand it, I'm just
[1:07:08] waiting for the way to come forth. Say,
[1:07:10] Lord, I'm trying to get to the point,
[1:07:12] Lord, that I can believe you for
[1:07:14] everything. Everything. No matter what
[1:07:16] it is, give ability. No matter how much
[1:07:18] I need, Lord, I'm believing that you can
[1:07:20] do the impossible
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; because the impossible has to become
[1:07:25] possible. The impossible is not
[1:07:27] impossible with God. So is it not
[1:07:30] impossible with God? And God said, "I
[1:07:32] won't be there. I'll be in you." So I
[1:07:34] got to believe that the God that's from
[1:07:36] heaven has come down to earth has got
[1:07:38] inside of me. And when I speak, he
[1:07:41] according to his word, it's him. It's
[1:07:43] going to come to pass
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; because I got the faith NOW TO BACK UP
[1:07:47] the word. And if THE FAITH BACKS UP THE
[1:07:49] WORD, there's nothing that can stand in
[1:07:51] the way. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP
[1:07:53] GOD from moving on my behalf CUZ NOW I
[1:07:56] GOT THE FAITH TO ACTIVATE. I FOUND THE
[1:07:58] KEY. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:08:01] SUPPOSED TO DO. LORD, ALL I GOT TO DO IS
[1:08:03] BELIEVE THAT ALL THING IS POSSIBLE AND
[1:08:06] EVERYTHING will come to pass.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; See, that's what we want to get to this
[1:08:16] morning. Lord, whatever is in my way,
[1:08:19] Lord, I got to let it go so that I can
[1:08:21] get to the level I can move out of the
[1:08:23] way and say, Lord, touch my faith.
[1:08:25] Ignite my faith, Lord, that the fire may
[1:08:28] burn and burn everything out of the way
[1:08:30] so that your Holy Ghost can reign in
[1:08:32] this place. Lord, move in such a mighty
[1:08:34] and a special way that we can
[1:08:36] understand, Lord, what you're doing in
[1:08:38] this hour.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Let us all stand this morning.
[1:08:44] Jesus.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Let us bow.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to your name.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, we heard your word this morning.
[1:08:56] Lord, we know that there's a place that
[1:08:58] you're trying to get us to this morning.
[1:09:00] Lord, we know that there's something
[1:09:02] there's a work that you're trying to
[1:09:03] work in our lives, Lord Jesus. Lord, we
[1:09:05] ask that you, Lord, if there's anyone
[1:09:07] here that said, "Lord, I'm at this spot
[1:09:09] in my life, but Lord, I need you to
[1:09:11] increase your faith." If that's your
[1:09:13] testimony, I want you to raise your hand
[1:09:15] this morning. Lord, I want you to
[1:09:17] reccrease increase my faith. Thank you.
[1:09:19] Thank you, Lord. Lord, I lift my hands
[1:09:22] too, Lord. Lord, I don't want to be
[1:09:24] satisfied with where I am in you, Lord.
[1:09:26] I want you to lift me higher, Lord. Take
[1:09:28] me higher, Lord. lift me higher in you,
[1:09:31] Lord, to one day, Lord, I can just walk
[1:09:33] from this life into that, Lord Jesus.
[1:09:36] Lord, we asking that you'd move in a
[1:09:37] mighty and a special way, Lord Jesus. If
[1:09:40] there's someone here this morning that
[1:09:42] said, "Lord, there's things that's
[1:09:44] hindering my faith. Lord, there's
[1:09:46] something in the way of blocking me from
[1:09:48] getting what you have for me." And you
[1:09:51] say, "Lord, I I I want to I want to turn
[1:09:53] my life over to you this morning, Lord.
[1:09:56] I want to give you my all, say the Lord,
[1:09:58] I can reach the level of faith that was
[1:10:00] spoken about this morning. If that's
[1:10:02] your testimony, I want you to lift your
[1:10:04] hand this morning.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see all the hands that are
[1:10:10] lifted, all the hearts that are open,
[1:10:12] Lord, we ask that you just come into
[1:10:14] their lives, Lord Jesus. And Lord,

[1:15:48] and every sin that does so easily beset
