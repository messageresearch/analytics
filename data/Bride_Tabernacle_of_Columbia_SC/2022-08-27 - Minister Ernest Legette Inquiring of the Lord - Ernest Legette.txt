amen and amen god is good amen [Music] we want to look at the book of second kings three we want to continue on from the other week on a little topic inquiring of the lord amen and did you pray about it we just wanted to try to finish that up by the grace of god tonight second kings three and we'll begin here at the let's begin at the let's begin at the ninth verse if you got it say amen and it reads so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and the king of israel said alas that the lord have called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire of the lord by him and one of the king of israel's servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shafak which poured water on the hands of elijah you may be seated tonight i'm going to read a little further down say that that poured water on the hands of elijah and 12th verse and joshua said the word of the lord is with is with him so the king of israel and joshua and the king of edom went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee lead to the prophets of thy father unto the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto their nay for the lord have called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the president of jehoshaphat the king of judah would not look toward the north see thee but but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches for thus saith the lord you shall not see when nor neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and this is about a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moral bites also into your hand may god bless to the reading of his word tonight by god's grace like we said we just want to talk to you for a moment just just finish up on on inquiring of the lord amen and you know just just looking here we won't go back over all the other prelude but i just says you know one of the things they were at a time where as a time of battle it was a time the time for to go out to war and so you know they had to come together and they gathered themselves together because it was it was a time for war it was a time to go out because they had rebellion against them and i thought about you know i says that you know where we at now in our in our spiritual walk our christian journey just say even for the sake of time we're at a time of war you know if it ain't one thing it's another the devil is fighting somewhat seemly like on every hand so it's time to go to battle do y'all believe that tonight but we got to know how to fight we can't just go out there and just go to battle and go to war and don't know how to fight giving weapons and don't know how to use them but that's why guard you know by spirit just like in the natural they train you how to go out to battle they train you how to use those weapons in the correct way because if you don't know how to use them in the correct way sometimes they can be more damaging uh to the to the user than they could be the enemy y'all believe that so they so they got the the ways that they that they train before they go out to battle but i said that you know they were in a time of war they had to go out and face the enemy and i thought about that i said you know we talk about it uh we rage it on every hand if it ain't one thing it's another but to really think about what we battle in here what we're dealing with you know we look at the first age and says that you know this age should mirror the first age as we were saying the other day is this age should mirror the first age what if this age should mirror the first age a lot of times we look at the mirroring only to have to do with the power that the first age had to mirror them only in the powers the acts the works that they did we'll do those work with the signs and wonders but remember that people die but spirits don't so the same demons they had to fight you know we got to fight those same demons today so it's not just the mirror and the power but i say are you ready for the persecution as well because just as they were persecuted don't you know you and i are be persecuted even here tonight you say sometimes they gave their natural life and i was saying the other day it may even come to that even here in our that we live in we have so much fanaticism and people now will kill you for anything won't they just for their beliefs and all these things what i say is tonight are are you willing to give your life come on have you counted up the cost of what it's going to take many times we want to be partaken of the glory but not not fellowshipping in the sufferings of christ but you know and that's one thing i said let's reckon tonight when we go out to war let's reckon come on reckon let's count out what the cost going to be let's look at you know the structure and all those things and see you know just exactly what we're facing here tonight and i says that you know as they were going out to ward one thing they one of the main things they did when they went out to battle they might have calculated how many people they had they might have calculated how much how much uh they had to go out for war but one thing they didn't do they didn't they didn't get the one you know the commander-in-chief they didn't consult him they didn't get him to be out in the forefront and that was a big problem and that's what we find even here today like like i said did you pray about it you might have everything calculated figured out but what it is when you when you get out there come on you got to have the commander-in-chief there with you y'all believe that so we find that it says that you know we got to know what we're facing a lot of times you know you go out to war you don't know what you're dealing with you don't know what you you battling i said we're dealing with more demons right now than ever known throughout all of history at one time you know that first age yes they dealt with the white horse rider didn't they then you had the red horse rider and black horse rider come but you know what we dealing with we're dealing with all of them mixed up together right the pale horserider and it says that and death and hell followed them so we got to be more ready now to fight than they even they were back then because we've got a the climax of all of it we got to deal with all the demons at one time and sometimes when we look at the forces that we up against god let you see just what you're dealing with sometimes you say lord how in the world are we going to make it come on but i believe the bible says that we're overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony don't you know that the battle ain't ours but the battle is the lord faith is the victory so you say how are we going to overcome these forces you got to start taking the the shield of faith come on you got to grab the word of god the strong hand of faith and begin believing god for what he said come on do y'all believe that you know i was thinking about something the other day i was telling brother simmons that you know he said something to my sister and and it came to pass just as he told her and i said you know what i told my sister i said that was a word of prophecy come on i said that was a that was a word of prophecy and i said but what it is you got to take it and believe it don't you know god's word is true you know god don't sometimes say have to come do all these special things he's already done it come on he's already laid the foundation open away the problem is we have trouble believing god we have trouble just settling with what god's word is we have trouble with just taking god at his word and saying lord i believe it come on god i'm just going to take you at your word that'll do a lot for us come on that'll move mountains i believe that you know it says that all things are possible to them that believe but but the faith come on move mountains but we find that i said that's what we're dealing with uh tonight you know we're dealing with we're dealing with all these spirits dealing with all these powers how we're dealing with all these unseen things israel could see their enemies you know throughout through the natural house but you and i we're battling a spiritual wickedness in high places we're battling demons on every side we battle and infiltration you don't know who's who's for you and who's against you sometimes you don't know who's possessed by spirit and who ain't sometimes come on even peter when he was beside jesus once and jesus told him you don't know what you're talking about come on you don't know he said get behind me satan why because the enemy had him for trade just like that didn't he and i said that even if the devil was even there present then how much more you think he present here tonight that's why we got to search ourselves daily lord let me find out what spirit i'm of so you got to get up early in the morning come on and seek god lord make the way for me today god keep me in the way i don't even know what i'm facing but god i know you know what i'm facing let the angels go and make the way before me watch over my children watch over me god don't let nothing all those fiery darts are the wicked i can't see him god but by faith i believe hallelujah that the blood has been applied and the devil can't cross that bloodline come on do y'all believe that those children of israel the night when the death angel passed by only thing they can do is hold on to a promise that god gave them right that if you place the blood over the door it says the night when the death angel comes come on he'll pass right so they all they could do was hold on to a promise that they had but you know the promise wouldn't have did them no good unless they put the blood on the door come on putting the blood on the door that that was that was going to keep the promise alive was putting the blood on the door hallelujah god made us many promises didn't he but what keeps that promise alive hallelujah you got to have faith to hold on to it you got to have faith to live the word faith to believe god faith that god will keep you faith that god will heal you faith that god is delivering you hallelujah how we gonna do it lord i don't know but i'm holding on to it god i believe what you said and that settles i'm going on with it hallelujah god will fight all night for you i know he will come on he'll fight all day for you cause the battle ain't charged y'all believe that tonight come on but it says that that's what that's what happened you know they went and and they didn't realize i wanted to read something here tonight if you don't mind some in our studies we can't get away from that but it says here in in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance how how can there be more trials well now it is strange but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing the doctors entering institutions and trying to down drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boasts a tremendous stores in the world of goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than they ever his age boasts to moral values and it is more corrupt than any age ever since the flood it talks about its knowledge in science but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields come on fighting a losing battle i said we at war tonight right but said they fighting a losing battle at all field fields though everything now seems to be more accessible said you don't really have nothing to be unhappy about now we got the most unhappiest people ever known in world history the most unnerved people ever known in one in world history come on he said you're trying to drown out unknown fears what you're afraid of something just ain't right in your spirit come on at night you can't sleep because something ruffling in your side your spirit you walking uneasy say what's wrong sometimes people don't even know what's wrong with them hallelujah well the devil does that come on but it's something about the peace of god something about when the holy ghost comes down in the soul and sweeps out all the uh uncle corruption and all those things comes down and sweeps out all the bitterness sweeps out all the malice sweeps out all the depression and those things that's a peace like noel no other hallelujah you don't have to worry about drowning out unknown fears you don't have fear but you got faith hallelujah do y'all believe that tonight oh jesus he says that the age boasts a better moral values and is more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about knowledge and science but it is fighting and losing battle all fields for the human mind and the soul and the spirit cannot comprehend or keep her breasts with all the changes that have come on the earth in one generation you'll say we're going all the way from horse and buggy and all those things but i like how he says that you know it cries that it has great amplitude of all these things but it keeps burning with the desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace said my god to the wicked they are miserable that means they are objects to be pity come on i said what we what are we what are we facing tonight come on what are we dealing with right now in the hour that we live in you know he said the objects to be pitted come on they they their hearts burning like an unsatisfied fire come on i was telling my cousin that the other week i said don't matter what you get you always want more you always seek more and grab and reach for more because none of that can't give you no satisfying portion many told you that that's gone on before i was walked up on something last night of uh of uh steve jobs and it was striking to me how his last statement he wrote this whole thing last statement and he said that you know i achieved all these great achievements that people said that i have that's what he said in life he says but though i achieved that all he said i still i still ain't don't have no joy he said i still ain't happy he began to talk about all the things that he said he said i still he says that i got all this money he said but i can't pay nobody to lay here and take this sickness for me i can't pay nobody to take this sickness and die in my place he said i could pay somebody to drive my car i could pay somebody to clean your house just example i could pay somebody do all these things he said but right now i can't pay nobody to take my place he said and that's that's sorrow he began to talk about all the money he said don't matter you driving in a like or roy's or also whatever he said or a car that cost three hundred dollars he said they both gonna take you to the same place that don't matter if you got a million dollar watch on or thirty dollar watch on they both gonna tell time come on he said they're materialistic things but he began to talk about that all of the achievements and so-called things he says that he still didn't have joy he still is empty he's still missing something come on unsatisfied fire come on burn and burn burning licking up everything around them hallelujah but i said i'm so glad tonight that i found that satisfying portion i'm glad tonight hallelujah i might not have that million dollar watch that big house all those things might be good but what is it if you don't have that satisfying portion what is it hallelujah like you said i'm dying i can't pay nobody to die to take this sickness i'm so glad that god took all my sickness hallelujah god took all my pain god went to the cross for me oh hallelujah oh jesus you know what it is sorrow and there's those that don't have no hope but you and i got hope tonight though this body be decayed hallelujah though the skin worms eat this flesh hallelujah we know that one day god is going to restore it all and bring it back that's our joy like paul i believe said o grave where is thy vic no death where is thy sting go grave where is thy victory hallelujah oh jesus but i said that's what it is come on don't be like don't be like that you haven't found that satisfying portion don't you know the satisfying portion is here tonight come on what you seeking what you running after come on you know we got to live this life but all the desires and all the things you desire for hallelujah all your fears you want your trouble don't you know god is here to meet it tonight all you got to do is open up and let god come in we try to convince people that all the time you got to let god come in you say well i have uh uh come on you got to search your life you got to search your heart hallelujah it's something you're holding on to let it go it ain't worth it and let god come in you'll be glad today that you did hallelujah that you made jesus your choice not that you chose him but that he chose you but y'all believe that tonight hallelujah oh jesus but we find out says that you know uh inquiring of the lord you know you know the bible begins talking about you know trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge him come on and he'll direct your paths come on you got the inquirer of the lord we say many times we make a lot of major decisions sometimes we think what's a minor decision no this ain't nothing yes but when when when you make that decision it has a major toll on your life it has a major turn on your life would look like it was something small come on what it did when it got in there it created all kind of havoc come on let yourself down in your soul your spirit you couldn't let it go because you thought it was innocent but there ain't nothing innocent about the devil hallelujah come on the devil like they say it's the devil come on ain't nothing innocent about him but we find that i would say you we got to let god have his way in our life but i said you know we make those i want to kind of speed along but i says you know we find that here like we said did you inquire another lord we got we got to start praying come on say we know what we we face and we see the the hour and the things that we're battling we got to start praying you got to start praying like you never prayed before you know your prayer life is going to make the difference come on you fighting unseen forces you fighting demons the carnal mind can't comprehend what you're fighting you don't have enough strength to face what you're facing it's going to take the holy ghost it's going to take the spirit of god supernaturally doing things in you that you didn't even know you was capable of and it ain't you but it's the holy ghost doing it like i said you're gonna have to pray like you ain't never prayed before you're gonna have to start asking god or every step that you take god help me take the right step god lead me in the right path it's too late in an hour now to get lost out here lord come on don't let me get lost but god lead me out hallelujah i don't know about you by saying we ready to take a rapture we want to take it but god's gonna have to lead us there god's gonna have to do something in our spirit to get us out of the place that we're in come on lukewarm cold come on all these things just relax come on god gonna have to do something ruffle our felters get us away from that relaxed mode to that point of desperation the way we learn to cry to god again and call on him while he's still able to be found i'm so glad today his ears ain't too heavy now his arms ain't too short we can still call on him come on i said call on him while he's still hearing you hallelujah don't wait to the time where he turned his face against you come on like jeremiah began to cry out to him that god turned his face against this city hallelujah he gonna destroy it with fire unless you repent don't you know that god has turned his face against his world come on they say america the whole world going insane come on hallelujah oh jesus but i'm glad that god's got us in his hand come on aren't y'all glad tonight oh jesus says but what it is they found that place like i said you got to inquire of the lord that's one thing they didn't do they didn't inquire in the lord so they got themselves out there on this journey without without the necessity the one little small thing that they didn't think about was now become such a the most thing that they needed in their journey and that was water right the prophet of god was bringing out typing out that water them going on a journey without water it's like the church moving on without the supernatural he said that's what it is they think they don't need it they got the they got the word they got this they got that now he said they're going on without the power come on they forgot about the power they forgot about the supernatural they forgot about the holy ghost fire baptism they forgot about that hallelujah but when they get out there and realize that the enemy is coming come on he coming he ain't playing around when they realize that their crowd hallelujah is there anybody here that can get a hold of god don't let it be too late come on oh jesus hallelujah he said that that's one thing that uh they forgot about he said like the church moving on today without without the supernatural you know i want to read something he said he says in the there are radio programs television programs and numerous church endeavors that are costing millions and millions of dollars wealth pours and pours into the church the membership increases along with the money yet the work is not being done as it was done when there was no money but rested solely on the ability given them by the holy ghost they are paid preachers paid assistance paid ministers of music and education paid choirs paid custodians programs and entertainment all costing great sums but for all of that the power is decreasing yes the church is rich but the power is not there god moves by his spirit not by the amount of money or talent you have in the church come on he says all that we got all that everything accessible now he says but we're doing what we're doing way more less than we are now than we did when we had the money way less now than you did when you didn't have he says we've got all these things he said yet the power is decreasing come on i said lord we want the power if we got to get back down on our knees crowd however long it takes god we need the power hallelujah children are being lost we need the power homes are being destroyed we need the power people are dying in sin what good is money then hallelujah without the power what good is church without the power hallelujah oh jesus you know i thought about israel and i said what separated them from the other nations was the supernatural right and they came out they had a cloud lead them by day fire there by night hallelujah everywhere they went they carry the ark out there i see the enemies when they going out to battle the enemies to see that heart coming see the cloud or whatever they go running shaking for fear hiding in heels why not just because of israel was some great nation because remember god said i chose you because you the least of all but they saw a power in that nation they saw a god a living guard in that nation so no matter they all come together to fight against israel but even even and they was going on a jericho wherever it was they began to testify that all the inhabitants are in fear their hearts are melting because they hear you coming hallelujah you might not seem to be the biggest group in all those things but we heard what god is doing among you hallelujah that's what separated them but from everybody else was the supernatural don't you know the devil ain't afraid of your church he ain't afraid come on come sit down in there what makes demons true is when you got the living god among you when somebody calling on that name of jesus hallelujah that's power behind that he'll go running for fear and warning come on many people call the name of jesus but demons don't tremble because he look at their life ain't no power in their voice hallelujah but when it's power in your voice when you live in the you got the life to back it up hallelujah you call that name jesus demons are flee that was a tremble hallelujah oh jesus do y'all believe that tonight that's why i said the devil ain't afraid to come to your church he ain't afraid especially if he don't see the he don't see the cloud he don't see a supernatural out among you but that's what made the difference come on god didn't just call us out to be a regular normal people or just another god i don't believe god saved me from a life of sin brought me filled me with a spirit just brought me from a mighty long way to just sit in church and be normal sit in church and just be cold just go through the motion of tradition come on god didn't do us like that but god brought you out so he can make you an example to the world that i'm still alive and well hallelujah oh jesus that god is still here that when everybody got claims that god is dead hallelujah god will raise you up here's one oh jesus that can testify that he's the same yesterday today and forever here's one hallelujah that can testify that he still heals that he still delivers that he's still safe here's one hallelujah have you considered my servant hallelujah come on god didn't just call you out to hold a pew come on god got the work that you want you do but you got the yield of god come on let go of the world and all those things i thought about that i said israel what made them separate from the rest of the nations was the supernatural come on looking at how the inhabitants were shaken when they heard that israel knows what's coming i said but what happened to those people what happened to the fire what happened to the power what happened to the fear that fell on the inhabitants of the land when they heard israel was coming what happened hallelujah but they got to that place of complacency they got to that place when they got in the land hallelujah began looking around at the other nations and everything want to be like everybody else but i said i began to look at my life hallelujah and i pray you look at your life tonight i said when you were desperate when you were out and sin you didn't know how you was gonna make it tomorrow come on you didn't want to be like everybody else you want god to do something special in you and you was willing to do whatever god has to get a move of god in your life but after god done brought you out hallelujah god damn made away sometimes we sit and we get complacent oh hallelujah get to that place you get to looking around come on you know i share my son moses the other day i'm saying you know you know like joshua he says this day have i set before you good and evil come on he began to tell the people i want you to make a choice they choose i want you to choose if god be god serve him but if you want to serve the other gods he said go ahead but i know one thing like you said for me at my house we're going to serve the lord because he says remember you make that choice god you see what god did to the habits of the land because of their sins because of their iniquities and their deeds and i began to share with my son moses i said the thing is you got to look at your life and where are you at right now and i said the lord shall terry where you end up tomorrow i said to be the result of a decision that you made the result of choices that you made so i began to tell you you got to make the right choices you got to choose hallelujah whether you want to serve god or serve the world you got to make that choice nobody can make that choice for you but i want to let you know i says that if you make that choice remember what god did to so many before you what god so many witnesses before you that you seen the end of it i said but you still got to make a choice come on but i said choosing jesus is the right thing do y'all believe that tonight i know y'all do hallelujah but i said that what it is we got to we got to find i said we come there you know i said what happened to that group but they got to that place you know and then they decide we want to acquire the lord thank thanks be to god that he was still able to be found but when they begin to go to guard come on you know and i like i like that what it did you know it brought the supernatural back among them i like how elisha told him he said don't look for rain don't look for wind he said but i just want you to make this valley full of ditches and god gonna send water come on don't look for it don't look for this and that he said i just want you to make this valley full of ditches you got to dig hallelujah and god is going to send water water enough come on to give you what you need to sustain you for the oncoming battle come on but their survival in that day depended on how of the ditches that they dug come on the bigger the ditch they dug the more water that they would have come on the more they dug the more god was going to send to sustain a member they had their cattle they had their beasts they had all these things not only that shoulders and all so just digging a little trench wasn't going to be enough hallelujah i could see them digging all night long digging dig and why because god is going to sit in the water come on i don't want to just dig just a little bit and don't even know whether i got enough hallelujah it lasts me through the battle and all that but you got to dig you know i liken that sometimes looking in our lives i said come on don't live close to the fence you gotta dig how i say how you dig tonight i was just meditating i said you know you got to get down on your knees and dig you got to get down on your knees and pray and dig come on dig out don't look at everybody else around you you got to look at yourself you got to look at your actions your ways like david said i consider my way you got to look at yourself you got to get down on your knees and dig lord help me lord help me root out everything that ain't like you it's things that's in your spirit god got the root out it's things that's down latching themselves to you and if you don't let god root it out it'll destroy you come on god i don't want to be destroyed god i don't want my soul to be lost help me guard the dead oh jesus come on i said you got to take that christian you got to take your walk personal come on you know i said digging uh depending on how much they dug depending on their survival in that day now i'm just saying here tonight come on don't you know prayer is gonna depend on your survival tonight how much you pray oh i pray no not keeping the clock but you got to get down in fervent prayer you got to get out and lose yourself lose yourself in god come on lose yourself to the place the way god takes over come on when you get up you know something happened you know something move down in the deep come on your survival is dependent on it your eternal destination is dependent on it tonight you got to dig come on until your soul is satisfied come on don't let nobody tell you you got it your soul come on you got to dig to your soul is satisfied hallelujah y'all believe that tonight [Applause] certainly
