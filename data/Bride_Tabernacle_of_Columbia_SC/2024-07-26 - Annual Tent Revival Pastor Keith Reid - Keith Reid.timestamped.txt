[1:01:33] Moses now shall thou see what I will do
[1:01:37] to Pharaoh for with a strong hands will
[1:01:41] I let them go and with a strong hand
[1:01:44] shall I shall he drive them out of his
[1:01:48] land and God spake unto Moses and said
[1:01:51] unto him I am the
[1:01:54] Lord and I I appeared unto Abraham and
[1:01:57] to Isaac and unto Jacob by my name
[1:02:01] almighty God but by my name Jehovah was
[1:02:05] I not known now every time that God is
[1:02:09] going to do a new thing he has a name
[1:02:13] for what he's going to do Hallelujah and

[1:02:20] them and will give them the land of
[1:02:22] Canaan and the land of their pilgrimage
[1:02:26] wherein they were a stranger and I have
[1:02:28] also heard the groaning of the children
[1:02:31] of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in
[1:02:34] bondage and I have remember my Covenant
[1:02:38] wherefore say unto the children of
[1:02:40] Israel I am the Lord and I will bring
[1:02:44] you out from under the burden of the
[1:02:47] Egyptians and I will rid you out of
[1:02:50] their bondage and I will redeem you with
[1:02:53] a stretch out arm and with a great
[1:02:56] judgment and I will take you to me for a
[1:03:00] people and I will be to you a God and he
[1:03:04] shall be and he shall know that I am the
[1:03:07] Lord your God which brought you out of
[1:03:10] under the bondage of the Egyptians and I
[1:03:13] will bring you into a land concerning
[1:03:16] which I swear turn to to give it to
[1:03:21] Abram and to Isaac and to Jacob and I
[1:03:24] will give it to you for an Heritage I
[1:03:29] am the
[1:03:31] Lord then over in the book of Acts
[1:03:34] chapter 3 and verse 19 I just love that
[1:03:41] scripture it says repent ye therefore
[1:03:44] and be

[1:03:57] before was preached unto you whom the
[1:03:59] Heaven Must receive until the time of

[1:04:51] captives there in Ghana amen and I you
[1:04:54] know I was told out there would held
[1:04:56] them their captive their their only
[1:04:58] course was to take that ship Amen to the
[1:05:02] West amen I could see at the top of the
[1:05:05] dungeon they they had the Church of
[1:05:08] England because the the English men that
[1:05:11] went to Ghana am me to take captives to
[1:05:14] the West they they didn't bring their
[1:05:16] wives uh they brought their religion
[1:05:18] with them hallelujah amen and I could
[1:05:22] amen reflect that amen black Africa
[1:05:26] and I'm identified with my
[1:05:28] forefathers amen I could REM I could
[1:05:31] think how they would have amen suffered
[1:05:34] in that dungeon amen their only cause
[1:05:37] was amen that ship and to reach the West
[1:05:39] uh amen and their way was
[1:05:42] slavery amen I've looked uh amen at the
[1:05:45] shackles and the chain uh amen that they
[1:05:48] held them with uh amen and you know
[1:05:50] people said let us leave that and let us
[1:05:52] move on but Israel as a na ation amen
[1:05:57] has never forget uh amen the things that
[1:06:00] they brought through and I will never
[1:06:02] forget uh amen how I came here to the
[1:06:05] West amen but I think of a greater
[1:06:09] emancipation Amen in 19 Hallelujah in
[1:06:13] 1838 uh amen when emancipation was
[1:06:17] declared in the west uh amen people
[1:06:19] could have dropped uh amen their

[1:06:53] free inde indeed
[1:06:57] Hallelujah we would like to look at the
[1:07:00] price of our
[1:07:02] Redemption what Redemption really means
[1:07:06] you know it was there in Israel amen
[1:07:09] that there were once a year where they
[1:07:11] would take a sensus of all the males
[1:07:15] that were there and everybody that was
[1:07:18] counted amen as the Bible said uh amen
[1:07:21] that you die not uh you were to pay off
[1:07:25] shackle and if the man was rich the
[1:07:29] price was half a shekele if he was poor
[1:07:33] the price was the same uh Hallelujah it
[1:07:35] doesn't matter who he was uh amen the
[1:07:38] price uh hallelujah amen for his release
[1:07:42] was the same uh amen and when I think of

[1:07:47] blood uh amen of Jesus Christ uh amen
[1:07:50] that was shed upon Mount Calvary amen I
[1:07:53] want to tell you tonight uh it doesn't
[1:07:55] matter who you are whether you're rich
[1:07:58] or you're poor uh whether you're white
[1:08:00] or you're black uh whether you're Indian
[1:08:02] or Chinese the price of redemption is
[1:08:06] the
[1:08:07] same
[1:08:09] hallelujah amen your price is not
[1:08:12] different from mine and my price is not
[1:08:15] different from yours uh amen but he paid

[1:40:13] Purge should have no more conscience for
[1:40:16] sin but in those sacrifices uh there is
[1:40:20] a remainder of sin every year uh for it
[1:40:22] is impossible for the blood of bulls and

[2:23:25] you
[2:23:27] know in
[2:23:30] 2022 when I came to this
[2:23:33] meeting before I came to South Carolina
[2:23:37] I stopped with friends in North
[2:23:41] Carolina and there was a sister for
[2:23:43] years she
[2:23:45] struggled with kidney
[2:23:48] failure and when I look at this young
[2:23:50] young couple and the struggles for 9
[2:23:53] hours per day she had to be on
[2:23:56] this machine to purify her blood because
[2:24:01] her kidneys never work I sit around that
[2:24:05] table and my pearls were with my
[2:24:09] tears as I got broken when I look at my
[2:24:12] own
[2:24:13] children and look at their lives and see
[2:24:15] what the devil was bringing them through
[2:24:21] you know last year when I came one week
[2:24:25] before I got here she had one kidney
[2:24:29] transplant and so when I came last year
[2:24:33] one week before I reached he had that
[2:24:35] transplant and the doctors were telling
[2:24:37] her the work of that one kidney was more
[2:24:42] than two kidneys if she had
[2:24:46] them and so in the first week of this
[2:24:48] month
[2:24:50] they had a
[2:24:51] celebration and they invited me to come
[2:24:54] and to celebrate what God has done for
[2:24:57] their
[2:24:57] lives you know I I was I I I was trying
[2:25:01] to be there but we had the hurricane
[2:25:04] come by way and knock out our power or
[2:25:08] water system I had to stay to take care
[2:25:11] of the farm I I I could not be there
[2:25:13] with them to celebrate but I say this
[2:25:16] one thing it doesn't matter what the
[2:25:19] devil creat
[2:25:21] create God is a mighty
[2:25:26] healer you have
[2:25:28] not because you ask not because when you
[2:25:32] ask you ask
[2:25:33] wavering but I believe
[2:25:36] tonight that if we've got a need and we
[2:25:38] bring it to Jesus Christ The God Who We
[2:25:42] Serve is able to deliver my sister if
[2:25:46] you'd sing something for us
