[33:36] whatever the need talk they you grant
[33:40] him today unless you're worried now in
[33:43] Jesus name Amen the Genesis 22 and 1 and
[33:56] it came to pass after these things that
[34:00] God did Abraham and said unto Him
[34:05] Abraham and he said Behold Here I am and
[34:12] he said take now thy son thy only son
[34:16] Isaac whom died love it and get thee
[34:22] into the land of Moriah and offer him
[34:26] there for a burnt offering upon one of
[34:30] the mountains which I will tell Diab and
[34:36] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[34:40] saddled his eyes and took two of his
[34:46] young men with him and his son Isaac his
[34:51] son and clave the wood and the burnt
[34:57] offering and rose up and went until the
[35:03] place of which God had told him and then
[35:09] on the third day Abraham lifted up his
[35:13] eyes and he saw the place afar off never
[35:18] ham said until his young men abide you
[35:22] here with the ass and I in the lad will
[35:29] go yonder and worship and come again to
[35:34] you if a ham said you come again and
[35:38] Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[35:42] offering and
[35:44] lead it upon eyes at his son and took
[35:48] the far in his hand and a knife and they
[35:54] went both of them together and I did
[35:59] speak unto Abraham his father and said
[36:04] My Father and he said here am I my son
[36:10] and he said behold the fire in the wood
[36:14] the wire is a lamb for the burnt
[36:17] offering and if I am said son my son God
[36:24] will provide and we said this morning
[36:27] God will provide let me finish reading
[36:34] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[36:39] they went both of them together and they
[36:45] came to the place which God had told him
[36:49] of and ever ham built an altar there and
[36:52] laid the wood in order and bound either
[36:58] his son and laid him on the altar upon
[37:02] the wood and Abraham stretched forth his
[37:06] hand and took the knife to slay his son
[37:09] and the angel of the Lord called out
[37:14] called unto him out of heaven and said
[37:19] Abraham Abraham and he said him are and
[37:25] he said lay not thy hand upon the lad
[37:29] neither do thou anything unto Him for
[37:35] now I know that thou fearest God seeing
[37:41] that thou has not withheld our son by
[37:45] all this son amen god bless the reading
[37:51] of his word now in the book of James in
[37:57] the book of James
[37:58] the second chapter and the 21st verse we
[38:07] want to talk this morning about works is
[38:10] faith Express and for subtopic God will
[38:18] provide works is faith Express like to
[38:26] tell you that God will provide
[38:32] here in James 2 and 21 will not even
[38:39] have our Father justified by works when
[38:42] he had offered either his son upon all
[38:46] to see how that how faith wrought with
[38:52] his works and by works were faint made
[38:57] perfect
[39:00] now the strip to declared that abraham
[39:06] believed God and because he believed God
[39:12] [Music]
[39:14] Paul talks about the way God looked at
[39:21] things and James talked about the way
[39:28] man looks at things the Bible tells us
[39:33] that we'll save by faith and not of
[39:38] works this any man should boast but it
[39:44] is to give of God
[39:46] now here James said if you show me your
[39:52] faith and I'll show you my works talk to
[39:56] my favorite that works at diet so by my
[40:01] brothers my sisters and my friends amen
[40:08] we heard
[40:11] servant of God says in a man is know his
[40:20] character is known by his works any man
[40:25] is known as character is known by his
[40:29] works another place he said the tree is
[40:36] known by his fruit no matter who is his
[40:44] works prove his character you take a man
[40:50] no matter how good he tries to be if his
[40:55] works are evil all his goodness won't
[41:03] amount to nothing a man word is his
[41:10] characteristics a man that his words is
[41:16] no good then you'll never have
[41:20] confidence in that man because his word
[41:24] is no good now think of that straight
[41:33] now don't let it go over think on the D
[41:42] but if you notice the scripture Jesus if
[41:50] you will say in your heart not in your
[41:55] intellect it never works no matter how
[42:02] much you try to make it work it won't
[42:07] work cause is intellectual and has any
[42:17] but when anything is eternal
[42:22] [Music]
[42:24] and it has no beginning
[42:29] anything with an end and a beginning has
[42:34] a near but you just those things which
[42:41] has no beginning and the only God has no
[42:48] beginning and no end
[42:52] to help the beginning there has to be
[42:59] has no beginning there has to be without
[43:04] God so God has no beginning God had no
[43:12] in the way that God began and where the
[43:17] gaudy eternity had no beginning and
[43:23] Halloween so God is releasing your not
[43:30] my fate our fate will tend to stop
[43:34] please but I have not seen God can take
[43:44] us into eternity is a please the God has
[43:57] prepared for you and I got pleased that
[44:01] he prepared he said don't let you leave
[44:09] in God leave also in me for in my
[44:15] father's house
[44:17] somebody said I need to go to my
[44:20] father's house if you want to go to the
[44:24] father's house did God have prepared
[44:29] oh please that you could go and find
[44:32] rest for your soul
[44:36] there is a place that God wants his
[44:40] people that come to but your words will
[44:48] express your faith if you say you trust
[44:54] and you believe God word then you must
[45:00] put in action what you believe if you
[45:06] say the Jesus is now Savior did you life
[45:13] will show that he is a savior saying you
[45:19] form you see save you from the knife
[45:25] that you used to live
[45:27] that's all works prove that's your faith
[45:31] it's not judge what is coming into your
[45:48] eternal destination for he said heaven
[45:58] and earth pass away but my word will
[46:02] never pass away God why did you turn off
[46:08] because in the beginning was the word
[46:11] and the Word was with God and the Word
[46:17] was God
[46:18] I'm going to tell you that your weight
[46:23] in a prayers God will Express what you
[46:30] need did you say you believe God and
[46:37] your life does not produce the same wave
[46:43] he said where I am
[46:52] for you please please please that you
[48:16] can come to that you can have rest for
[48:21] your soul Jesus so common to me will
[48:36] give you rest
[48:38] I'm talking about a soul that neither
[48:42] I'm talking about somebody they might
[48:45] know where they can go

[50:54] the block to way to the Tree of Life he
[50:58] said on the heat of that tree you'll
[51:01] never die I want you to know
[51:05] [Music]

[58:16] promised he meant you to have if it did
[58:19] not produce that life then there's
[58:21] something inside of you they meant that
[58:24] you holding on to he meant you got to
[58:27] come to God and you got to lay
[58:28] everything down
[58:29] he meant Ava Hamm was offering up his
[58:33] only son he meant all the son that I got
[58:37] a man he knew that God was evil I'm not
[58:42] looking at what I see I say God will
[58:50] provide somebody I looked around and
[58:56] said Oh father I see the sacrifice I
[59:00] mean I see the altar and we got the wood
[59:03] here everything is beautiful but where
[59:06] is the sacrifice he said God will
[59:09] provide
[59:09] I wonder are you looking around looking
[59:13] at your situation and conditioner are
[59:18] you trusting God or you're looking to
[59:20] God to provide amen they may have acted
[59:24] upon God Word somehow he meant we
[59:28] stopped acting we stopped believing God
[59:31] we thought it was God gonna do it we
[59:34] wanted a whole own into what we had
[59:38] instead of giving it up all we held own
[59:42] and we wouldn't give up our eyes but way
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:25] I said God will provide God will provide
[1:00:59] I'm so glad that we are serving a god
[1:01:02] that will he will
[1:01:06] somebody said I'm not talking about her
[1:01:08] he meant what somebody else said I'm not
[1:01:11] talking about what he done for others
[1:01:13] I'm talking about what he done for me I
[1:01:17] don't know if God can save you God can
[1:01:21] keep you and if God can bring you
[1:01:24] through this then he can bring you
[1:01:26] through that if God can bring you out a
[1:01:28] little then God can bring you out a lot
[1:01:33] how deep you are and how lost you were
[1:01:36] they may God still can do it I want you
[1:01:40] to know one day when I was 99 years old
[1:01:46] one day when my wife was 90 years old I
[1:01:51] couldn't have a son

[1:04:22] allow him to fix it for you
[1:04:24] who allow him to fix it for you
[1:04:28] God can't fix it he'll do it for you
[1:04:32] that you allow him they meant God he was
[1:04:37] able to do it somebody today he meant
