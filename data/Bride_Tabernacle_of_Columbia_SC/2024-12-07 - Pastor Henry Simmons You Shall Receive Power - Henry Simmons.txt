Holy Ghost catch a fire lord and let your people oh God enter in Lord amen for where you are that's where we want to be in Jesus name we thank you amen the book of Acts one I was just reading a little bit on the Holy Ghost series and by the grace of God and and I thank God for that we can read things that sometimes it set others on fire that it could set our souls on fire also sometimes we think the Holy Ghost is just tongue speaking and just a dance and a shout acts one and it says excuse me a pag is somewhat coming together the formy treaties have I made o theophus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which he said ye have heard of me for John truly bapti baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and when they therefore were come together they asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time or the season which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all the Judea and in Samaria and in the utmost parts of the earth may God bless the read word you may be seated we want to I was just reading and meditate and I say Lord ye shall receive power it's about to go out it's praise it's low praise God praise God that was too loud praise God Amen you shall receive power amen but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you amen amen now uh people said now what kind of power you talking about power amen you know often times we we see today that many people claim that they have the Holy Ghost but we got to recognize that the Holy Ghost is a promise from God I was telling the sister you know that just got baptized I said amen after you get baptized you need to be looking for the promise amen the Holy Ghost amen and if you're not looking for the Holy Ghost then amen then it's beneath your privileges amen the purpose of Amen being baptized is that you shall receive what power amen okay so Luke Luke 24 Luke 24 the the power is a promise to you God promis you power and you can hold God to his word God you made a promise to me you told me that I shall have power and God I want it you you know it's too many people sat around a amen and they just look back and and just laid back and like we just in church playing amen but you need to be expecting power people that got so much of it that amen that you want it it becomes contagious that other folks said I want what they got amen I want what you got amen you got to see somebody that got something that you want amen but do you see folks that claim are gued and nobody want what they got because it's not amen praise God something amen that causes amen the miraculous to take place miracles to happen amen change of life I want it children in the home are want the power amen because amen they see amen a light shining in the home they said I want what mama got I know amen when I came to the age I wanted what mama had I wanted that power amen praise God I wanted something amen that was real I didn't want the fake but I wanted the real amen I see people shout and dance and amen speak in tongues and still I didn't see a life amen amen but I want the power have you received the power do you want the power Hallelujah Luke 24 and 44 and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which was written in the LA Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me Jesus had Rose and set all power in heaven and in Earth is in my hand he had all power and he wanted to give you power because he had defeated death hell in the grave and he said you shall have power amen he said no man take my life I lay it down but I got the power to take it up again and if the spirit be in you that raised Jesus from the dead it shall also Quicken your Mor body you ought to want that quick in power amen the mechanics is all right but we need Dynamics you need the power you need to cry Lord I need power amen Lord I want the power amen I want it desperation amen you got to get desperate that I want it God Amen I don't want to think I got it I don't want to feel like I got it I want to know I have it Hallelujah I want to

but amen he said to me brother Simmon he said the devil those demons told me you was going to cast me out tonight amen praise God and I thank God that God Amen the demons can recognize who you are but other folk don't know who you are I remember one time a prophet just came to the church when I was a young Minister and she said said to me she told me some things that were happening and and she said

now so I just couldn't let her but I was just just as young that's about 40 n years ago or almost 50 years ago you know what I'm saying and I you know and I was just W who am I really I see sometimes God has to send somebody just to tell you who you are because sometimes you might not know that you've been chosen by God sometimes you might not know that you important to God though everybody might come against you folks might talk about you scone you look at you as nothing but God recognize [Music] you when God recognize you makes the difference amen praise God you shall have power amen walked
