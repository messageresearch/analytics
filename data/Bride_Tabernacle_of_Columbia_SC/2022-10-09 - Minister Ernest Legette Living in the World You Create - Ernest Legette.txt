stand in need of Lord we thank you we appreciate you for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen we want to look at the book of Second Kings by God's grace Second Kings and we'll begin at the at the uh eighth verse try not to hold you long this morning amen Second Kings six and eight we gotta say man Second Kings six and eight and it reads then the king of Syria award against Israel and took counsel with the servants saying in such and such place shall my Camp be and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that I'll pass not such a place for the other the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told them and warned of him warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of Syria was so troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel no and and one of the servants said none my Lord O King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speaketh in thy bed chamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may sin and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he's is in Dothan therefore sent he they're their horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and hosts Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servants said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he's answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha may God had blessed to the reading of his words you may be seated this morning God is good amen we want to minister this morning on living in a world that you create amen living in a world that you create you know you know it's probably God's talking once he's saying that you know once you've been born again or you have an ounce of God in you it's enough power in you to create your own world and to go live there he says and if it wasn't a law against it the children of God would do that they would create their own world and go live a private life on it but that's how much power you and I are packing this morning you know once you've been born again the power that's in you you know but like you said it's got laws that govern that governs that power that's in you so we want to talk this morning about living in the world you created amen you know I was sharing with my son not long ago and I was telling him I said I want you to realize that you know this life is built upon choices and I says that you know the choices that you're making right now I can try to lead you in a way and teach you right from wrong but I say is that in in all when it comes down to the end it's going to be by your own choices and the choices that you make and I said you know I want you to think about where you are right now and I want you to if the Lord should tarry 10 years from now I want you to look at your life and where you find yourself but I want you to realize that wherever you find yourself at it's a result of the choices that you made come on that's what God makes us free moral agents he's not going to force us to do anything but he gives you a choice you know the children once had a question that says that if God already know everything then how can you have a choice I said God knows the beginning from the ending but even though he already knows he still he still allows you to make your own choices he doesn't Force she's still he still allows you to make your own choices and but he already know the beginning from the end and he already know what choice you'll make and that's why he could save you know Jacob have I love and he saw have I hate us before the children was even born why because he already know what choice they they would make that's why he can take your name and before the foundation of the world the lamb could already be slain and he can take your name and write it in the Lamb's Book of Life because he already knew what choice you'd make and sometimes if we look from the natural eye we'll see somebody in the position the way they are and we'll say there's no way that they can make it now I know they name ain't on the lamb Book of Life as we was teaching the other night we're talking about the wheat and the tears you could say I know that they're not a wheat but it's something about God God knows the beginning from the ending he don't judge a man by just where the condition where he is but he knows his thoughts concerning you and they're good and not evil he know how he saw you before the world began he know how he saw you way in his mind and if your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life I don't care what kind of condition you are what kind of depths or a place where you are in your life what kind of change that the devil got hold on you come on when God began to call in on you those chains Can't Hold You When God began to calling on you conditions can't hold you nothing in this world can hold you when God begin to calling on you because what it is he bringing you forth that way you can manifest the image that he had of you in his mind and I'm so glad today that when we think about those things that when we were dead and trespassing sin come on and all these walked our way in times past but the Bible says but God who was a rich in Mercy where it is his love that he had towards us come on he already knew that in all those things he was going to be rich in Mercy he knew that one day and all of your sin one day you'd hear the voice of God and you'd want a way out Hallelujah he knew that deep down in your heart you would want him one day Hallelujah so he made provision to get you out of that place that you were in aren't you glad of that this morning come on you ever felt that way sometimes you know you look in your life and say that you know I always wanted to give my life to God but I just couldn't do it I always wanted to you know break free from the life that I was in but I I just couldn't seem to break free every time I tried you know it seemed like something was holding me back come on and it was it was demon powers but one day God looked down upon you Hallelujah and he saw those demons holding you but he began to call out in the spirit let him go Hallelujah and then no matter how much they tried to hold on you no matter how much they try to cry out for help he had no other choice but to let you go why because it was something drawing on you it was something pulling on you Hallelujah that was stronger than the thing that had you bound and you can come out and look back and say I know it was God that brought me Hallelujah I knew it was God that brought me from a mighty long way come on not by might nor by power but by his Spirit come on Hallelujah said I know it was God that brought me come on I like that song they were singing the other night with my savior found me and wrapped his arms All Around Me Oh the joy that came to me come on come on there's something about that you know they singing those songs but those are true songs those are real songs Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost you might have didn't realize you were lost come on but you were lost come on and one day God found you come on and he showed you the way he didn't just tell you the way but he showed you the way he led you out Hallelujah aren't you glad for that this morning come on Hallelujah I said living in the world that you create we find that you know the where you at right now so saying that you know you created that world that you're living in come on the atmosphere around you remember you create the atmosphere around it if all you got is negativity though all the atmosphere is going to be negative around come on but you have the power and it lies in your tongue come on it's on your lips you got the power to change any circumstance to change the condition you got the power and to speak to the storm the wind and the waves that's in your life you got the power to speak to them you don't have to sit there and then I know it's raining I know it's pouring but you got the power in you to speak to that storm and that storm will have to obey the words that's coming out of your mouth why because it's not necessarily you got the power but God has given you the authority Hallelujah he said that if you say to the mountain be thou removed it'll have to do as you say God has given you the authority Hallelujah I said living in the world that you created this morning you know we were talking about the other day that says when you when when you by faith take the word into your heart come on by faith and put it and put it on your lips and begin to speak that word come on it says that that's deity speaking Every Mountain got to move Every Chain has to let go because you speaking it ain't you but it's God speaking and he's speaking what not some man-made Creed a dog not something that he just heard but speaking the word come on Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word can't pass away when you speak to that mountain it might you might not see it moving like we're saying it might just be one grain of sand at a time but nevertheless the mountain is moving you said how do you know the mountain is moving by faith has got to move because God says so Hallelujah and what God said it can't fail Hallelujah he said with his stripes you are healed the pain might get worse your body might get sicker but with his stripes Hallelujah oh the devil can't stand before that it's something about it the devil can't stand before the word he can stand before your church and Creed and all these things but he can't stand before the word now when the word comes that's it's settled then it's over with why because God Is Spoken Hallelujah the creator has spoken and it has to be hallelujah oh that gets me excited this morning you know it's something about it I shared a testimony all the time I says that always when I was in my worst uh situation across the roads or trials in life it never felt that God failed that God always gave me a word and that word didn't just come from somewhere but it always came sometimes as a scripture most of the time and that scripture been laying there all the time you read it all the time but it's something about in your time of need in your time of great trial in your time of person execution and heavy hardness and your darkest hour Hallelujah then when you read that word something about life came to it and it's no longer a scripture but not his life to you now it's something you holding on to Hallelujah now it's life between life and death I'm holding on to the word of God hallelujah that's all I got I'm holding on to it Hallelujah and that's something good to hold on to the word of God hallelujah you can hold on to a church you can hold on to Friendship come on but they'll failure but when you holding on to the word everybody else can forsake you know everything else can leave you but that word hallelujah that word of comfort you in the Midnight Hour that word is strengthened you Hallelujah that word will give you Joy Hallelujah when you're saying that word got the power to pick you up Hallelujah out of that place you in oh Jesus y'all believe that this morning I'm so excited about the word that's why the word got to be your absolute don't let nobody take the word away from you come on come on the word got to be your absolute I don't come on I don't need nothing to give me the word hallelujah some people look for the word plus come on I always talked about you know your natural body you know the older you get you got to start uh adding uh like vitamins and all kind of taking medication and stuff to to put back what your body ain't putting out or what the food ain't giving you you might have ate the same food when you were younger and all and you felt fine but now you got to start adding other things iron whatever to help your body out come on because what you eating ain't doing it for you no more but it's something about the word of God you'll never have to add nothing to it or take nothing away from I don't care how old you get we're gonna be enough come on it's gonna be enough to sustain you to keep your Hallelujah you ain't gonna never stop your growth but the word you're gonna keep growing and keep getting stronger and keep getting more faith upon Faith come on you're gonna keep being changed from Glory the glory why because it's the word hallelujah it gets sweeter and sweeter as a I want to love between my Lord and I come on I know I'm yelling at you this morning come on but God is so good it's something like Joy Bell's ringing down in your soul come on when you know that you got a revelation that that's what it is God give you the word hallelujah and that's enough come on I said living in the world that you created remember you know you got the power to change your situation come on it's on your lips you got the power to do that you know we see here in the scriptures that you know they were down and encamped about the enemy the enemy account the bottom and you know unless you got up I could see him that morning get up he knew that they that the people were accounting about him come on and the enemy was what looked like it was totally against him but I said living in the world that you create what world you living in this morning Alicia wasn't living in that world that reacted to what he saw or that what what he saw affected him come on oh that what he heard affected him he wasn't affected by these five senses because he wasn't living in that World come on so when he got up to him it was just a normal day but his servant began I could see fear gripping and serving heart why because of what he saw come on I see the enemy out there it looks like that we are defeated looks like we're about to be taken captive or maybe even killed because I'm looking at the enemy come on but I can see Alicia Hallelujah he wasn't living in that world but he was living in another world Hallelujah he was living in a world of Faith he said don't you worry about that don't you know that is more with us than it is with them hallelujah oh Jesus come on don't you know this morning that is more with us Emma that greater is he that's in you then he that's in the world amen come on I said what world you living in this morning come on you're living in the carnal realm remember these carnal things are affection pain or Fiction come on sickness of affection amen come on finances or fiction wanted all these things in this world will affect you if that's the world you living in but he said that he took us and placed Us in Heavenly places I believe in those heavenly places you aren't affected by pain you aren't affected by finances you aren't affected by anything in this world in Heavenly places why because you know that all things are possible if you would only believe Hallelujah in Heavenly places where God is that's where I want to be oh geez Hallelujah you know it makes a difference where you are come on what and let what world are you living in I can see Elisha I always say it's telling them come on he says uh more is more with us than it is with them it's serving maybe looking at them saying you ain't seeing what I see come on but I could lie I can see Elisha telling them yes but you ain't seeing what I see come on that's when he began to pray God opened this man eyes amen that he might be able to see amen sometimes when you try to encourage the Saints try to encourage your friends and all these things you say Lord open their eyes that they might see oh I know you're going through but all is well this morning come on what do you mean all is well look don't you see what I'm going through come on oh but yes you don't see what I see you don't see what I see how the word says come on God ain't gonna let you fail don't you see that he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you don't you see that he said I won't fail you come on to every place the solely of quick touch I'm gonna give it to you God open your eyes Hallelujah come on I like that in the scriptures how David said in the presence of mine enemies come on thou has anointed my head with all God want to do something when your enemy is all around you come on open their eyes God want to do something in the presence of your enemies when everybody else was discouraged the Bible says David encouraged himself in the Lord come on he said I ain't looking to man in all the armies they never saved me before but God saved me and what and if God saved me then he'll save me now there ain't no mountain too high come on ain't no valley too long ain't no test too hard that God can't bring us through if he did it then he can do it now Hallelujah I'm putting my trust in the Lord hallelujah I'm putting my trust in almighty God to bring me through Hallelujah do y'all believe that this morning come on somebody praise God don't you see this morning come on God open their eyes that they might see come on keep talking to him say Lord open this man eyes and when his eyes was open up he began to see didn't he ain't cherries and Angels un all around them come on on a numeral company all around them I could see that when his eyes was open he said oh I see now come on I believe that the fear was gone then come on the enemy was still there but the fear is gone now why the fear left because now he could see Hallelujah that though my enemies might be there I ain't living in that World come on I ain't living in that place I'm living in a place where I can see the Angels Hallelujah well I know that they're encamped about me Hallelujah don't y'all believe that this morning come on you know Paul talked about it in Hebrews 12 let's look at that by the grace of God Hebrews 12. come on I said living in the world that you create come on what world are you living in this morning Hebrews 12. living in the world that you create I said where are you living this morning Hebrews 12 and 1. you got to say Amen and it reads wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him and do the cross despising the shame and it set down the right hand of God I think I wrote the wrong scripture down y'all forgive me this morning I wrote the wrong scripture down y'all forgive me come on I said but we coming to we we're in the place where it's in another innumerable come on company of angels do y'all believe that this morning come on they ain't Counting about those that fear them you know it's something about that I say as you living in the world that you create come on the way you living at this morning is the world that you created the place where you are come on no matter what condition I find like the Bible says no matter where you are to find yourself what to be content right come on so what what it is you you knowing that this Earth ain't my home anyway come on we just uh pilgrims and sojournals we just passing through come on this ain't our home anyway we're just trying to get to that place that God has provided for us but even right now God wants you to taste of that place I said that the angels of God are encamped about you come on and then what it is you know like like it says a lot of times you might can't physically see the Angels but you can feel the effects of them come on you know that they're near around about you Hallelujah you can't see those angels around your car when you're on the highway driving down the highway you don't see the Angels but they're there doing what God and you keeping that wreck from happening keeping anything from that tire from blowing out what it is the angels of God are encountered about you come on you didn't get there on your own but it was the angels of God there Hallelujah come on we always say Have You Ever Seen The Wind you never saw the wind come on but you saw the effects of it you started to win the trees bending over and all you didn't see the wind but you saw the effects of them of it because and you knew it was there just about the effects of it come on how do we know God is here because we still see the effects of it come on you able to walk and talk this morning you could see the effects of it Hallelujah you got something to praise God for you let God take it away you'll realize then there's little things that you thought nothing about come on it was the grace of God taking care of you it was the grace of God keeping you it was the grace of God watching over you let God take it away then you'll learn how to praise God then you'll learn how to be thankful for the end won't you Hallelujah oh Jesus you know this uh my doctor's telling me the other day she says man Mr Ernest he said you had a rough couple of months didn't you these last couple of months and I said yeah I said it was coming from every angle come on but I'm still here hallelujah I've been through trials but I'm still here been through pain and all but I'm still here come on I said even after all of the the scares and all these things and blood pressure face swelling all these things the other night walking in the closet no shoes on stepped on glass I don't know where the glass come from cut my foot up so bad I'm calling for help I say y'all help me I don't crawled out the bathroom the the the closet and was in the bathroom laying on the floor I'm talking about blood was everywhere I'm thinking the devil telling me you about to bleed out say you keep calling you keep screaming I started I saw that blood I started feeling light-headed with us seeing the blood and then it says I start call nobody come so I started instead of calling everybody I started saying Jesus Jesus I started calling to you I said Jesus help Jesus help me I started calling Jesus then Moses come in the bathroom he said he said dad what happened there was blood all over her then he went and got his mom I said I called y'all so long y'all didn't answer I just started calling Jesus my wife told me he said that's probably who you should have called from the beginning Jesus Hallelujah but it's something about her like my doctor saying you know I've been through a lot these last couple months but what it is it ain't nothing but the devil come on doing what attacking you God must be God something in store for us God must we got something prepared for us so I said what I'm gonna keep praising God hallelujah I ain't got nothing to complain about I got joy unspeakable and full of Glory I ain't got nothing to complain about I got something to testify about I got something to tell somebody that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah oh oh come on y'all believe that this morning something about I said the world that you're living in come on what world are you living in this morning come on you know those priests where they ate that that bread it depending on where that bread was stored come on right you had the outer Court the inner court but then you had behind the veil Hallelujah and in that in that behind the veil where the hole is a hole this was it didn't it didn't matter what the weather was like on the outside amen because back there it was the same all the time back there it was the glory of God that lit up the place back there in that place come on there was a place where God was and you ain't you wasn't affected by what the weather was come on that bread didn't go stale that bread didn't have worms in it and all that along with this state the bread that was back there because God was the glory of it Hallelujah and I said that's what it is today what place are you living in what world are you living in today are you living on the outer courts come on where you affected by the weather and all these things are you living on the inner courts Hallelujah where you only got George just from day to day all you living Behind the Veil come on because when you live behind the veil when you in that close personal relationship with God nothing don't affect you come whatever come today whatever come tomorrow you can sing that little song I know that I can make it I know that I can stand no matter what comes my way come on my life is in his hands why because I'm behind the veil Hallelujah I'm not affected by the wind I'm not affected by the rain come on but it's Faith back there hallelujah it's the glory of God back there come on all things are possible back there in that place that's where I want to live hallelujah oh Jesus come on you know in that place I said what world are you living in come on you know we find that I says there's so many things that you know you you I think about Adam and Eve and how in the beginning come on they were in the garden in Paradise right living in a world of paradise amen living in a world where they had access to the Tree of Life come on where they could live forever right that's the world that they were living in but the devil got to begin to talking to them and trick them to come from behind that world from out of that world begin to talk to them about some other place or some other thing that God ain't showing like God trying to hold something back from him come on he gave your life what would a man want more than life come on come on whether the profit a man that gain the whole world and don't have life to lose his soul come on what more would you want in life come on but it's something about the devil made it so enticing that it seemed that God was hiding something from him that it was something better out there Hallelujah but they didn't know that it was another world out there come on but in that world they was going Spirits pain in that world they was going Spirit sickness and hatred and jealousy in that world they didn't know nothing about it but when they came Hallelujah and ate of the tree we know what it was but when the devil tricked them Hallelujah then all of a sudden things began to change that lying that they might have could have pet he'd eat you up now Hallelujah come on the things that seem to be oh everything's so lovely oh it unchanged now why because now they're living in a different place come on they were living in a place that not God created but they created that world by Disobedience to the word of God come on like we said they made a choice amen didn't they come on now they they they uh uh uh living by the facts of the living in the effects of the choice they made come on Hallelujah yes they're living in a world that they created come on but I thank God that he allowed us gave us Grace Hallelujah by shed blood even in that he had a way that we can get back to that world that we can get back to the tree of life that we can get back to that place the way when we speak come on everything will be as you say God made provision for us to get back to that place come on Hallelujah do the cross him in his shed blood but you got to come to the Cross come on there ain't no other way you got to come to the Cross you got to deny yourself and come and follow him Hallelujah empty out let God come in oh Jesus Hallelujah I said the problem is today people don't want to empty out they want to come to God and still be full with all the baggage and Luggage the stuff that they brought in from the world come on but all those things you might come to God but until you empty out he can't fuel you up come on you got to empty out you got to let go of everything come on God change my desires change my ways Lord Save Me From Myself help me to help the out Lord that you might come in take my will Lord and make it your will take my desire and make it your desire God I want to be empty Lord empty me out God that you can come in hallelujah oh it's a blessing when the Lord come in it's a blessing when you helped it out Hallelujah in the spirit of God come fill you up then you know then that the struggle is over then you know that the journey is belongs to God now to battle the fight belongs to him I ain't got to fight no more Hallelujah all I got to do is yield and let God have his way in my life how many want that morning come on God wants to give it to you I said he'll be out come on I said the world you created come on Adam and he was living in the world now that they created right wasn't it come on there's living in a world now where one son to kill the other because you're jealous of them are you living in the world now it's thieves and all these abandons and things brought in but yeah that's the world that they created right amen come on I say it's that what world are you living in I had so many examples this morning I thought about David Hallelujah him and what was the difference between him and Saul and the rest of Israel they were living in two different worlds come on Saul and them you know Israel they were living in the world that they created right you say how did they create that world because it was a time where God was their leader it was a time where God was their King but they didn't want God to be their King no more come on God will just use the prophet and he would speak the word give them the word and he said I'm gonna fight all your battles come on I'm gonna go out before you I'm Gonna Be Your Champion amen come on that's where they were living that's how they were living one time where God was fighting all the battles but then they came to a place where they didn't want to live in that place no more come on they wanted to venture out the Bible says that you know that we want a king like the other so we can be like the other nations come on don't you know what kind of world those other nations are living in don't you know the world those other nations are living in come on my judgment and wrath fell upon them come on because of the things that they did that's how that's the world they're living in come on where they subject to the Judgment of God Amen but where you are if you stay behind come on I like that little song I'm Gonna hide behind that old mountain come on Jesus is that mountain where the Chilly Winds Don't Blow come on the devil wants you to come from behind that mountain Hallelujah y'all believe that this morning come on but Israel and they found themselves they wanted the king but they didn't know Goliath was coming they didn't know in that world you had to fight your own battles they didn't know in that world you got a king now don't come to me let your king go out and fight Hallelujah but they didn't know that their King when he saw that giant he was gonna be scared amen that King come on that they wanted he saw that giant he wouldn't go out and fight him come on but it's something about if God would have still been their King there ain't no giant that God won't face there ain't no trial that God won't show up to Hallelujah he said fear not come on Imma Be Your battle ax come on Imma Be Your your War General fear not come on I'm a fight for you Hallelujah come on it was a time then God ain't afraid of nobody but you saw Saul knows what are you doing hiding all Israel trembling right they were they were they were feeling the effects of the world they were living in come on other places where they were living what me come on but I thank God he had a little boy come on back on the back side hurting some that he wasn't living in that world was he even though he was part of Israel he was living in a realm of faith he was living in a realm the way he took God at his word amen that he said it was we'll possess the gates of our enemy come on that I'll fight for you Hallelujah come on that no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life come on as long as you keep my word and stay in it come on meditating it meditating it day and night he promised my fathers these things come on and I'm gonna take God at his word you had a little boy living in another world living in another realm a realm of faith but that went Bears Lions no matter what it was that boy wasn't stirred about that but he was living in another world that they can't do me no harm because the anointing is here because the presence of God is here because God is fighting for me Hallelujah I like how it says that the the lion whatever came and and took one uh sheep out of there but the Bible says that David said I went after him and I caught him about a beard I think about that little boy remember the Bible said he was a runny little small fellow come on but he went after that lion and caught him about a beard how close he had to be to that lion to grab him about a beard come on and slave but what was it it wasn't David and his strength of who he was but it was the anointing come on it was the promise of God it was the realm of faith that he was living in that there wasn't no child not and stand before where he was living at because it was faith amen hallelujah and he said that Goliath would be just as one of these right amen amen Paul I saw them didn't know what David was talking about he couldn't see they couldn't see what David saw because he was living in another place come on David went right out there didn't he I said what world are you living in this morning come on what world remember the world you're living in is the one you created it's a world out there of fear you know that come on and fear have torment don't it because it's not a devil fear of Torment you fear bring things on you that ain't even there because that's what fear does in that World come on but in that realm of faith in that place come on there's no fear in that place there's no doubt in that place there's nothing in there Hallelujah but you in the word come on y'all y'all become one you speak just like God's speaking come on why because you speaking the word it's deity it's on your lips come on you can take charge now you can walk like when they were on the ship in the Jesus the Bible says was in the bottom of the ship sleeping but everybody else crying out for fear Master you don't care if we die come on why because they were living in two different worlds Jesus even though he was on the ship he said yield a little faith come on why are you doubting for don't you know hallelujah oh Jesus I said why are you doubting this morning don't you know who is the master of the wind don't you know who to make of the rain and all these things don't you know this morning why are you doubting hallelujah oh Jesus come on God is so good this morning I said what world are you living in come on you know I was thinking about it and our child told sister Connie I was going to tell her testimony and I told her in something or how you know they said that of the hummingbird in the garage or something and says that brother Jeremiah hit him hit him with a fly SWAT or something and said that the bird they couldn't find them I think they said Josh found him and brought him brought him in the house and a little bird was well it must have been broke up and couldn't fly and she said why'd you hit the bird let's pray for him they say they told you you know you prayed for him so sister Connie say she took the bird in the hand and began to pray for the bird and said Lord would you heal this little bird so he could fly and she said don't you know that little bird took out took his wings and just flew right out of her hands man and I said that I was talking to brother Jeremiah about it last night he said it sure happened just like that brother she said well after she prayed that bird flew right out of her hand and I said the thing is I said don't you know God works just like that some people can say oh that wasn't that what no come on but God works just like that don't you know he hears your prayer that when you pray come on if all you got to do is believe it Hallelujah you ain't got to see it just believe it and watch God come on that's all you do prayer Works come on prayer still works pray come on and watch what God do hallelujah how many believe that this morning come on I said that when the word get on your lips come on it's like deity speaking what world are you living in come on I believe God want to get us to a place to live in that world of Faith what do you think these trials and tribulations are about you know the Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for right the evidence of Things Not Seen faith is a substance faith is real it's a place that you can live in you know I said Lord I want to live in that place we're going to have to you know why because it's things coming on the world that the medical world nobody don't can't deal with so we're gonna have to live in that place we're going to have to find find that place of Faith as I was sharing with the people I said you know when us when our face swelling up I sat in the car after I got out of the doctor's office I said Lord they don't know what's wrong with me I said God they just stretch they just grabbing right now they don't know what's wrong with me I said but God you know exactly what's wrong with me I said it ain't nothing but demons and Devils come on all these sickness all these things that's all it is is the devil I said God you know how to beat the devil come on and how he gonna do it he gonna do it with the word ain't it come on it's not nothing magical out there what it is it's the word of God come on and the devil can't stand before it and I said Lord I said they don't know what's wrong with me I said but you know what I'm putting it in your hands now come on and that's the best hands to be in how many believe that this morning amen somebody give God praise come on I said prayer still works today prayer still works do y'all believe that come on I said think about it what world you live in I want it done I didn't know I wouldn't have had time but I wanted to talk about those dimensions you know that's out there you know the first three dimensions with light and all these things are and you got a fourth dimension the radio waves and you know The Fifth Dimension or the reason I lost six Dimension all those things I said but what it is they're not nowhere far off but they're right here but it takes instruments to pick up those rims don't it said radio and television waves are moving through the building right now but you wouldn't know it but you take a radio or something and put it here and start turning the stations it'll pick it right up won't it because now you got something the elements to be able to contact that Dimension come on and I said that's that's all it is with faith come on it's another place that you can live in where all things are possible it's another place where you can live in when fear don't affect you man we're healing is yours where Deliverance is yours where the power is yours it's a place and it's right here it ain't no way far off but you got to have what it takes to contact that room amen what it is what does it take Faith come on you can have the power but not have faith operated somebody say you born again you got the power yes you got the power but you need Faith to operate the power come on you still got to believe no matter what you still got to have faith you got to have faith faith in God that God will do exactly what he says come on you can have it like we says but where is your faith oh ye a little faith where is your faith this morning come on what world are you living in this morning I want to challenge you today what trial are you going through where are you all what situation what's going on how are the storms in your life come on does it affect you come on no doubt it might but you can live in another world where those things don't even affect you you can be like Alicia and say don't you know that it's more with us than it is with them come on you can be like David and says he didn't curse thou God come on and he says that come on I'll go out and fight him don't you know who our God is he gave us promises nothing ain't gonna be to stand before David told him he said you come to me with a sword and a spear but I come to you in the name of the Lord a hosts and today come on you're gonna fall to them ain't that right come on what world are you living in this morning let us about our heads Jesus what world are you living in I said where are you
