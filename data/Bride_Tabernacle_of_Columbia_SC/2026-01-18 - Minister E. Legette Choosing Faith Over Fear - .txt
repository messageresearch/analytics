Where I ain't affected by the rain, the wind. I'm going to go back there behind the shakana glory. Hallelujah. Rise above it all. Hallelujah. Let us bow our heads with a word of prayer tonight. I mean this [music] morning. If you have a special need, you can make it known by the lifting of your hands. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to you this morning as humble as we know how, Lord. Oh God, to say thank you for your grace, Lord. And oh Lord, bringing us through another week, Lord. And oh God, Lord, there's so many, Lord, to pray for this morning. And but God, you know them all by name. And Lord, we pray, God, that you go by and meet the needs. Lord, we pray for those hands that are lifted, Lord, the hearts that have gone up this morning for you. God, I pray that you would bless them, Lord, this morning. Oh God, we see, oh God, the weather outside, Lord, and oh God, we just pray, Lord, that you'd bless your children, Lord. And those that have pressed their way out, those that have desired to come, Lord, this morning, but just couldn't make it, Lord. I just pray you grant them, oh God, the blessings, Lord. Oh God, give them the desires of their heart. Lord, we thank you, Lord. As we look to you, Lord, uh, oh God, open your word. I just pray, God, that if we said or done anything that ain't like you, oh Lord, if it would hinder or move, God, this morning, your spirit, oh God, from having its way, Lord, we pray that you would forgive us and, oh God, help us to get out of your way, Lord, and find the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, Lord, that we might be able to hear from heaven. Do it for us, God. I pray move in a mighty way, Lord, for we love you. We appreciate you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God is good. Amen. We want to look at the book of Luke by the grace of God. Luke this morning, Luke uh the 8th chapter and we'll begin [snorts] at the the 50th verse. Amen. [crying] [snorts and clears throat] Y'all feel all right this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. Luke 8 and we'll begin here at the the 50th verse. You got it. Say amen. We'll begin at the 49th 49th verse. Amen. You got it. Say amen. And it reads, "While he yet spake there, there cometh one of the ruler of the syn of the synagogue. How sang to him, thy daughter is um it says, thy daughter is dead." uh trouble not the master. But when Jesus heard it, did I read that right? When Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, "Fear not. Believe only, and she shall be made whole." And when he came in into the house, he suffered no man to go in, say Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden, and all wept, and beweld her. But he said, "Weep not, she is not dead, but she sleepeth." And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, "Made, arise." And her spirit came again, and she arose straight away. And he commanded to give her meat. And her parents were astonished. But he charged them that they should tell no man what was done. May God have bless the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning by the grace of God. We want to talk about this morning choosing faith over fear. Amen. Choosing faith over fear. Now you know I says, you know, you got to make a choice now, right? Come on. I says you can choose to to fear, right? &gt;&gt; Or you can choose to have faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know many of times Jesus when he dealt with situations uh he says um to the people or when he come to work a miracle the first thing he would do is say what fear not right he had to deal with fear right fear not and have what faith come on I says you got it's a choice you make right and I says the reason why you know I was thinking and I was because I I got a lot here but I was thinking I said it's one thing you know when you making a choice Right? I says you know what happens is you know the first choice that most people choose is what fear right because you know things come upon you and what brings it like the brother Simmons was preaching the other night about these five senses right they bring that they bring that fear because you know faith is is not contacted by those things see faith is something that you can't see like it says you have no knowledge of it right but it's still it's it that's what brings those things that were not as though They were right. So what happens is a fear what it is take start begins to take take root in you right you know the prophet of God talking about the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind right and he says the reason why being in the mind because that's where the decisions are made at right so what happens is you know uh uh like we says you got to choose a faith over fear what happens is you know in your mind automatically you know a scenery a battle is taking place Right. And what it is, whoever wins the battleground of the mind, that's what's going that's who's going to dominate. How many believe that this morning? So, we find that I was I was looking at the other day and Numbers 13, I know you read it the other night, but I says uh uh if they were to only, you know, uh uh you know, look back when they got across the land of all the things that God had did for them already, right? if they going to only like like I was saying the other night remember you know that hey when I was in Egypt you see you got to real you got to look back at the time when you was hopeless right and the time when you knew that you couldn't do it and all of a sudden God showed up didn't he and he began doing things in your life working miracles and all right so he brought you out so if it was him bringing you out right and you ain't had nothing to do with it then why you try to inject yourself in it now &gt;&gt; hallelujah But that's what the devil does, ain't it? Tries to get you to think that you got a part to play. Only part I believe you and I got to play is to praise God and keep on on our journey. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. I believe that. You know, one thing about it when you choosing when you making that choice, just like Joshua was telling him, choose you this day, right? Who you going to serve? He says, if you going to serve the other gods or whatever, he said serve them, right? But I want to tell you, look what it is. He I'm I'm going let you look now. What did those other gods do for you? They had you in bondage, right? They had you in trouble all the time, didn't they? They had you sick. They had you this. He says, "But if you going to serve the Lord, what did God do for you?" Hallelujah. All he ever done was heal you, right? All he ever done was come see about you. All he ever done was Hallelujah. be good to you, right? So he said, "You can make your choice, but as for me in my house, hallelujah, we going to serve the Lord, right? We going to stay with God because God has been too good to us." &gt;&gt; Come on. Come what may, let who go and turn whatever may. I know one thing God has been too good to us. Hallelujah. So one thing we find that I says you know uh we find that it says here here Jesus he had to deal with it right deal with the fear. So he was in there, you know, going on his healing campaign, right? And something about it, it looks like people had to come to a place in their life like it looked like the people would have came to a place to where they seen Jesus do enough, right? That they can look and say that I seen them do enough. I don't have to doubt them. Hallelujah. And so that woman that had the issue, she had already seen, she had already heard, maybe she heard, right? Yeah. So, she already made her decision, right? That I'm going to choose faith over fear. Hallelujah. Right. Even though they say I got it, nobody can help me. But I heard what this man is doing. Hallelujah. And if I can just get close enough to him to touch the hem of his garment, something happened, right? That's what her faith told her, ain't it? I can see the battle going taking place. But she chose to have faith. And what did her faith cause her to do? Press her way on out anyway. Right. when people that's what it is what it is say it's a it's a battle right people like was saying I was I was studying this and I says what it is you know um sometimes you can talk to the wrong people about your situation &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; ain't that the truth come on you talk to the wrong person about it and you'll be worse off than you was you say a lot of times hey I I'm starting to feel this crook in my neck right and somebody say oh man it might be this you might have pulled a muscle You might need this. And next thing you know, your neck hurting way worse than it was before you talked to that person. Ain't it? Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen now. &gt;&gt; I know I ain't the only one that deal with that. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got a little light headache. Oh man, I heard somebody go as far as say it might be a tumor in the brain. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You need to go get that checked out. &gt;&gt; Come on. I always tell the testimony. That's why we says choosing faith, [screaming] right, over fear. Hallelujah. I remember I had uh matter of fact the same night that brother Simmons had prayed for. I was saying uh uh I was tell testimony at work and uh I mean I was talking about it some years ago cuz they had been bothering me for a while and one of the boys at work was saying how it could be a broken uh shin was I was just showing them that it wasn't as bad at the time. I was showing them that and he was explaining to me what it was but what happened to him and all this and I could when he started talking to me it felt like all of he was just sucking me on in. Right. And all of a sudden as he was talking to me, I said, "Man, get away from me like that." Like he said, "What?" I said, "Man, get away from me like that." He didn't know. He was like, "What?" I said, "No, I ain't I walked. I don't want to hear that." Right? Cuz what it is, he sucked you on in. Right? People don't know it, but the devil be doing that, don't it? The devil anoint people, don't he? &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus had to tell Peter, "Get behind me." Right? He said, "You don't you don't know what it is." Uh uh. He didn't know what he was saying. But that's why it says what? What I was telling somebody the other day, you got to get all that negative talk away. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You got to think. You got to start talking positive. Even a situation this bad, you still got to think positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the song says, you got to still say, "Lord, I'mma rise above it all." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was the other day just enjoying the Lord by myself in the house, right? I says, a little song came on that everything is working together for my good. Hallelujah. So I started looking at all situations, right? And all trials. And I started saying to those trials, all things. Hallelujah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, it is not one trial out. All things. Hallelujah. And I start look I started looking. I said, you know what? Every every trial I'm going look all things no matter what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come what may, I'm choosing faith over fear. Hallelujah. I know that all things going to work together for my good. Hallelujah. How do you know that? [screaming] Because the word said it would. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. And I believe the word, right? Come on. All things. Come on. Not some things. Come on. And then I started cuz I go there in Romans 8. I started saying to myself, uh uh what shall we say then to these things? Right. Come on. I was riding exercise bike in the morning. I was riding. I says, "What shall we say to these things?" Right? I said, "What things?" I started calling out all kind of things, right? What shall we say then? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm choosing faith over fear. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul talked about persecutions, trials. He says, "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time ain't worthy to be compared with the glory that God's got in store for us." Hallelujah. What shall we say to these things? &gt;&gt; He didn't say you wouldn't have trials, did he? Come on. But he says, "What say?" And I like how he goes on to say, "If God before us," Hallelujah. Come on, somebody ought to give God praise this morning. I said, if God be before us, Hallelujah. Who can be against us? Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm choosing faith over fear. Come on. &gt;&gt; If God before us, I don't know about you, I says, what it is, you got to know that God is on your side. &gt;&gt; Not is he only on your side, but he's on the inside. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he's on the inside, you know, when Jesus was on that ship that night, that ship couldn't be sunk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could it? Come on. The master was on that ship. You couldn't you he had you couldn't sink that ship, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Hallelujah. Something about it, but they didn't know wind blowing rain. Come on. But then they only they thought about it. Come on. Oh, Jesus is down there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Let me go wake him up. First thing he do is he say, "Oh, you little faith." Right? &gt;&gt; Stood up said, "Uh, peace be still." Right? &gt;&gt; And the wind and the waves obeyed him. Look like that would have been enough that throughout the rest of their life from then on they would have chose faith over fear. Right? Long as he is with us, right? Don't you know one thing about it? He says that if you would only believe. Come on. &gt;&gt; So all these signs will follow them that believe in my name. Come on. Ain't nothing standing before that name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No trial, nothing standing before that name. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's why if you go in your own name, you got to fight. But one thing about it, when you put the name of Jesus out there, hallelujah, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. They used to sing that little song, when I call Jesus, he'll answer prayer. Hallelujah. Come on. And he will. Hallelujah. How many believe that this morning? But what it is in your mind. Come on. You got to choose faith over fear, right? &gt;&gt; People start creating things, don't they? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what happens. &gt;&gt; I was telling somebody the other day, I said, "Come on, trying to get you away from that." I say, "What you got to do? you got to have is I got faith. And I know but it's a when you say you got faith, ain't no buts about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's I got I believe and that's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't know I believe but you know you either believe or you don't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh hallelujah. That's the truth ain't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God I [screaming] believe thy word oh Lord is settled in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. I believe you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going start calling it already. It's already here. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe God. Hallelujah. But what it is, I was trying to share that with somebody the other day. Well, I said, you know, uh uh uh the battleground that said is in the mind and you got a choice, right? You know, the the Hebrew uh the Israelites had a choice when they got to the land, right? And and the spies went over. They got to see it, right? I don't want to go over all that. No. Uh brother Simmons other night, he took all my points. But they got over they got in the land, right? They went over there. spies went over there and they came back with the fruits, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. And they say, "We ain't doubting you, Moses, that that the land is just like what God said it is." Hallelujah. We ain't doubting that now. Come on. Come on. Oh, hallelujah. God brought us out with a mighty hand. Come on. Just like he said, didn't he? One thing about it, you could have looked back and said, "God ain't never fail us yet." Hallelujah. He did everything [screaming] he said. Why would he fail us now? Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Come on. Hallelujah. That's the way I look at all my trials now. Come on. &gt;&gt; I said that God done brought me this far. Why would he bring me this far to leave me? &gt;&gt; Why would he bring, you know, I was singing, they sing that little song the other day on the radio. I mean on on the thing says I come too far to turn around. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I come too far. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why would God leave me now? But what it is, the devil tell you that, right? God got you out here. What I feel like the Hebrew boys, even if he don't, he's able. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm choosing to believe God. &gt;&gt; I don't got nowhere else to go. Hallelujah. I don't got nowhere else to to trust. I ain't got nobody else. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Come on. If I'm out here by myself, might as well keep believing on them. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. I'm already out here by the devil. You're out here by yourself, then what I'm going to do. Hallelujah. Might as well keep waiting on them, right? Oh, Jesus. But you got to choose. Like I says, you know, when the thing about it, when those spies came back, come on, with the very fruits of the land. This was the test of all test, wasn't it? Now they come back with fruit, carrying it. Oh, the great they was rejoicing when they saw fruit. Come on. But then now what happens? Uh the the the other 10 spies say, "Oh, but the land giants over there. Come on. The wall cities. Come on. Think about they too strong for us." And they said, "And we in our own eyes." Who asked you to use your eyes? Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. We in our own [screaming] sight. Who asked you to look? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. You in your own sight in Egypt couldn't get out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't see your way out of that, did you? But God brought you out, didn't he? Hallelujah. Trust and believe. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At the Red Sea, you couldn't see your way out of that. Neither could you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. But here he is. Fear not. Hallelujah. Speak. Right. Come on. Cry not. Speak. Right? Why you crying unto me? Speak. What he told Moses. Right. Moses began to tell him. Come on. the Egyptians. You see the day. Come on. You won't see after the day, you won't see them no more forever. Right? &gt;&gt; Cuz what he said, God is going to fight for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. The day. Can you remember that day? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you were there, [screaming] didn't you heard Moses say, "God is going to fight for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. You were, but get away from that fear. God is doing the fighting. Hallelujah. When you ain't the one fighting and your big brother is fighting like they say in in the old times when he fighting you ain't worried my big brother fighting. Hallelujah. Right. Come on. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You know one thing about it I was looking at I was I was looking at some things. It says fear over faith. I mean faith over fear. Right. You got a choice. Right. I was looking at one thing uh with Mike Tyson. Right. People see saw Mike Tyson's Iron Mike. He was a he was a mean like bad per he was the knockout king right you go around him you might tremble right but one thing about it I know some boys from New York was telling me some stories about Mike Tyson and clubs up there say he wasn't just he wasn't just no say he was from the I ain't going to say that word of the pit he was from the street for real wasn't he &gt;&gt; come on says man he went to a store once and a gang leader heard he was down there on the block at the showed up with a whole entourage of people. Mike wasn't afraid though. [laughter] Mike came out, knocked him out and left him out on the street cold. Come on. The gang leader. Then he got up talking about Mike Snookie. Right. But one thing about I saw a video of of him and he was fighting, especially in his younger years. Most of the fights didn't go past two rounds, but he had been out there before one fight crying like a baby. They got a video of him crying like a baby. His his trainer said, "What's wrong, Mike?" He said, "I'm scared to go in there. I'm scared I'mma lose." And the trainer was like, "Mike," he said. He leaned Big Mike leaned his head on that man's shoulder. He patting him like a baby saying, "Go ahead and get it out." Cuz when you get in the ring, you can't have you. You can only think about one thing and that's winning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Go ahead and get it out your system. Right? You know that same fighting when they knock that man out the first round. But what it is, come on. I says, "What?" That's why you got to get fear away from you, right? &gt;&gt; When you out there fighting, you can't be worried about whether I'm going to win or lose. Hallelujah. You got to have one thing on your mind and that's [screaming] the victory. Hallelujah. Come on. I believe that. How many believe that this morning? But the devil gets you out there fearing. Come on. But what it is because faith can't operate there, right? I mean, yeah, faith can't operate there. But when you cast down all fears, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. And you standing there, then what it is, that's the ground that God want to show up, right? Hallelujah. That's why he begin to work his mighty works. &gt;&gt; Come on. But what it is, you got to choose that, don't you? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Those Hebrew boys, I mean, those Israelites there at the land, come on. When when the 10 spies begin to give that evil report, look at what it did to their minds. Come on. That clouded that report clouded out all of what God had already done for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. All the victories that God had already won for them, that evil report [screaming] wiped all that out of their mind, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, I know God [screaming] did this, but I don't know if he can do that. Hallelujah. Come on. I want to tell you something. If God can save me from a life of sin and shame, hallelujah. If God can bring me from the muck into the mighty clay, if he can clean me up and [screaming] fill me with his precious Holy Ghost, I know God can do all things. Hallelujah. Why would he do that? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Say, why would he clean you up and not use you? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Why would he clean you up? You like a glass of dishes you wash off, you put them up in the shelves. I'mma wash them off. But why if you ain't going to never use [laughter] them again, why you do that, right? Come on. But you clean them up cuz [screaming] you going to use them one day. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't worry about where you at now. Just let [screaming] the master clean you up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't worry about what part you going to play. Just [screaming] let the master clean you up &gt;&gt; and he'll use you how he want to use you. Hallelujah. And one thing about him, you can't tell God who to use. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was reading that scripture. I listen to that scripture the other day, yesterday, I think it was. I was telling Charlotte, it stirred me up. I think it's Romans nine and how he was saying he says God have mercy on whomever he will. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. He saying him that run will but it's the God that showeth the mercy. Right. &gt;&gt; He says God what it is. So we say, "Hey, God this and that." Come on. You You can't tell God. God have mercy on whomever he pleased. Right? &gt;&gt; He set one up and he take the other down. You can't tell God what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Paul talk about it in a righteousness with God and all that. Right? Said, "Therefore 98, have he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he harden." God do what he want to do, don't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. And I'm so glad, hallelujah. that God ain't like man, right? &gt;&gt; God don't got no respect to persons. Oh, that's my friend. That's my God. God don't do that. Hallelujah. But God go by predestination. I for know them in the mind of God. I don't care what everybody else saying about them. I don't care what everybody else thinking about them. They were in my [screaming] mind. Hallelujah. And I know who they are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know my thoughts concerning you. Come on. &gt;&gt; Everybody thinking bad, but I know you. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't even see yourself. &gt;&gt; As nothing, but I [screaming] know who you are. &gt;&gt; And my spirit come to wake it up. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh Jesus. God want to wake somebody up. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Come on. Shake something out. Lucen. Hallelujah. He went to Gideon and he woke him up, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Gideon hiding. Come on. Fear got a hold of him, right? Why? What are you hiding for, Gideon? Come on. Cuz every time [screaming] God blesses, the devil take our blessings. Well, why you let them take your blessings for him? &gt;&gt; Didn't he say you possess the gates of all of your enemies? &gt;&gt; Aren't you a Hebrew? Aren't you a [screaming] child of God? &gt;&gt; Come on. Where is your faith? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "Thou mighty man of valor." &gt;&gt; Something woke up in Gideon, didn't it? Come on. That's what it is with with the preaching of the gospel. God send somebody your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't happen to me before. Somebody tear you all the way down, right? Or something happened. You look you look at yourself cuz somebody just told you you ain't nothing and they pointing out all of your faults, right? And you might I it happened to me. You start crying because all that truth, right? But then all of a sudden, God send a word by your way. Hallelujah. A word by your way to lift you up out of that, right? To lift up your head to say, "Hey, I'm a son. I'm a daughter of God. Hey, I don't have to stay here, right? &gt;&gt; I'm going to return to the Lord. I'm going to go to God. Hallelujah. And God is merciful to forgive. Ain't he? Somebody give the Lord praise this morning. Come on. I said choosing faith over fear, right? You know, I had a got a whole lot. So, so choosing faith over fear, right? They chose they chose uh uh fear, didn't they? Come on. Imagine what that did. Wiped out all the things that God had done for them. Just that little talk clouded them. Clouded them so much. The way the Bible says they wept and cried all night. Come on. They went from when they saw the fruits, oh, rejoicing the fruits. But then that little bit of talk had wiped that all out. Right. Went went from one extreme to the next. From having joy, [screaming] ready to take the land to now crying and weeping. He brought us out here to die where there are no graves in Egypt. Right? There's a turn crying and weeping all night long. Right? But the thing was you had two that was trying to say, "Hey, you know what? You know, don't do that to people." See, you listen to the wrong people, right? &gt;&gt; It might have been that, but we weren't even looking at that, right? In our eyes, we didn't see ourselves as grasshoppers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our eyes, we saw that we was more than able. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what we saw. Don't know what they saw. What we saw, we're well more than able. &gt;&gt; Come on. To take the land. [screaming] Why? Because God gave it to us. One thing about it, come on. You know, we're not we're not going off of just something natural. Like I was looking at uh uh what I said is faith over fear. We ain't going off natural ability, right? Or human ability. But what are we looking for to overcome? By the word of God. Hallelujah. Say overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of that testimony. We looking to overcome by what he's already did. Right? We're trusting to make it because God said we'll make it. Hallelujah. We trusting to be overcomers because God said we'll be overcomers. Not in our own human ability. If that's the case, we would have felt a long time ago. But what it is, I'm trusting in uncction from the holy one. Hallelujah. Come on. How many trusting in that uncction this morning? Oh God. I said you got to choose that though, right? Cuz it's put before you, ain't it? Ain't that's what it did. Drug them all the way down. But the two was trying to trying to uh uh I say get the people revived. But that's what it is. Come on. You got to deal. I I I says what you got to deal with fear, right? You got to deal with that first because fear the Bible talk about fear bring torment, right? Come on. It'll torment you, won't it? Come on. What's going down and say what's wrong with that person? What's wrong? You know, fear torment them, right? They say, "Oh, I'm all right." You know something wrong with them, right? Come on. They about where? Come on. Fear did that, done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring torment you. torment you where you can't sleep at night, torment you the way things were there, but it's there now because you brought it on yourself. The thing you feared came upon you, right? &gt;&gt; But what it is, you got to find a way, like I say, to shake yourself. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to change the people that you listening to. Sometimes you going to tell somebody about it. Like we say, you know, you going to tell Jesus about it, but you got to find your prayer partner. Hallelujah. Come on. And when you can't find nobody else, you got to do like David did and encourage yourself. Hallelujah. When everybody else want to encourage me, I encourage myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Right. &gt;&gt; I stir myself up. I have revival [screaming] all by myself. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. One thing about it, but you got to deal with it. Like I said, fear. Come on. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. You got to deal with that. I like I was looking at some things. I said how David, he was in in Psalms, believe it 27, he was saying, "The the Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear?" Come on. You got to take that real. You know one thing about it if the Lord if God before if God is fighting your if he is there who are you going to fear what going to stand before you come on he said the Lord is a strength to my life right whom shall I be afraid come on I ain't got to fear everybody else fearing what I got to fear for come on go [screaming] out there and even saw all them in the tents fear got them right they can fight till they saw Goliath come out there right &gt;&gt; he looked like too big of a trial too big of a storm too big of a test, right? [screaming] Oh, Jesus. Bible said they were shaking, right? Talks all with him in the tents. But it's somebody that chose faith over fear. Hallelujah. Because he weren't looking at his what his present situation was. &gt;&gt; Come on. But he was trusting in the power of almighty God. Hallelujah. I might not be big enough, but what am I trusting in? The power of almighty God. I'm trusting in the promise of God. I'm trusting that God will bring me out. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. I don't know about you, but I'm trusting that this morning. Come on. But you got to deal with it, right? And one thing about it sometimes I like how you know here now in our scripture reading Jesus was saying when he went, you know, he's sitting there having revival meetings. Come on. And and having healings and somebody come tell him the pastor uh Levas Jerus tell him hey your daughter done died. So he immediately Jesus had to say get he said oh don't don't don't don't fear fear not right fear not come on don't let I know he just told you some bad news but fear not &gt;&gt; shake yourself &gt;&gt; come on you just heard bad news come on in my is shake yourself don't fear now &gt;&gt; remember who's in control hallelujah &gt;&gt; shake yourself &gt;&gt; remember quit you like me remember who you are hallelujah &gt;&gt; oh Jesus I can see them say Samson and the Philistines are upon you. He shook himself, [screaming] right? As long as that locks were still there. Now, come on. He know who he was, [screaming] didn't he? Know the promise that God made, the covenant he had with God, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. No matter how many of them out there, don't even matter. Hallelujah. Right? &gt;&gt; Why? Because I know that something supernatural getting ready to happen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, Jesus. You know what I was looking at? I says a lot of times when adversity comes, right? When the squeeze come, you watch the supernatural show up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. When all odds is against you and the squeeze show up, I said that's when that's when the supernatural takes place. That's when the gifts show up. Right. That's when [screaming] God shows up. &gt;&gt; Why does he do it that way? Cuz no man ain't going to get no glory. When God get done with [screaming] it, you'll know it was that God that done it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Won't be no doubt in your mind who done that. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And I thank God what it is. He wants to get all the glory, don't he? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But what it is, you got to deal with it. Jesus had to deal with that, didn't he? Fear not. Come on. Don't let Come on. I'll go with you. Come on. Right. &gt;&gt; That's why when he went there, he only took a certain pe few people in the house with him. Right. So I said, "Why you didn't take me in?" Come on. I don't know. But he only called a couple people in there. Right. &gt;&gt; Then when he got in there, he said, "Hey, everybody's weeping." He said, "Oh, she ain't dead. She's sleep." The Bible said they laughed him, didn't they? Amen. &gt;&gt; They just weeping and mourning and then they go, "Man, hallelujah. That done been working miracles, doing signs and wonders, right? &gt;&gt; Coming to pray. Come to And y'all, they laughed the scorn, didn't they?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, Jesus put them all out, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Get out of the house. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. Can I say it like that? &gt;&gt; You don't want to believe, get out of here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let God work. &gt;&gt; And when God work, you won't be laughing then. Hallelujah. But what it is, you'll see the power of God. You'll see [screaming] the glory. You'll see the manifestation of the spirit. Hallelujah. And you won't laugh no more at it, will you? Come on. Then you'll be wanting Jesus to come by your house. Hallelujah. And work a miracle for you. That's what it ought to do. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; But what it is sometimes instead of doing that, it causes people to envy, right? He's doing it by all these things. [screaming] But what it was, come on. fear. Don't fear. Get that away from you. Let God work in your life. How many want to do that this morning? Somebody give God praise. Amen. I says what it is. You got to fear. You got to choose that. Come on. I said you got to choose it, right? You got to choose faith, right? Cuz what it is, fear, as I said, something you got to deal with. And what it is, the devil put all those things for you, right? It's one thing about the devil. He knows that God going to do exactly what he said he going to do. [clears throat] He knows that that when God speaks all you got when you believe it that's it right. I says but what it is when you start uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh feeding into it. You know the prophet God was talking about Eve. He he says when he stopped even listening to her the devil right in her mind and that's what he does while you even entertaining it. Right. Stop uh and what happens? He walks right in your mind. Right. Get you all uh uh what it say? twist it all up. But one thing about it, come on, you got to be sold out, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Because the devil, that's one thing. He He knows that God going to do what he says. And he knows that it's without faith, it's impossible to please God, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Before you even come and ask anything, you got to first believe that he is. &gt;&gt; And he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. The devil know that, don't he? So his job is to keep you away, [screaming] right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes he'll tell you, "Oh, that's just the way it's going to be. That's just your lot." Did God tell you that? &gt;&gt; Come on. What did God say? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, but you don't know. I I know one thing. I know what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; Come on. And I know one thing that he'll hold true to that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the devil knows that he puts all kind of things before you, right? &gt;&gt; But come on. But you got a choice. What are you going to do? I don't know about you, but I said, "I'm going to believe God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at look at the world today. You can't have confidence in nothing out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Look at Oh, now we going to take do this. You don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's your faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or will you be caught up in fear? &gt;&gt; Come on. If you trusting in anything else, [screaming] you will be. &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, when you realize, come on. These mountainies, Come on. Oh, hallelujah. Yeah. They're greater than I can face, but they ain't greater than the God I serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Cuz the God I serve, he created all these things. He do what he want and what he will in the earth. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's we only the working of [screaming] his power. &gt;&gt; Come on. And he brought me this far. I know he'll take me the rest of the way. You know, I says faith. Come on. Faith. You know, one thing I was looking at, I says when it's put before you at a couple examples. When I was looking at those Hebrew boys, I mean, I mean, yeah, the Hebrew boys in Daniel, you know, in captivity, right? But one thing about it, even though they were in captivity, right, they still could live a Christian life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though. And you know what? I I said God honored that, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. They were in the king's house bringing them food and all that. You got [screaming] to eat it. Come on. And you don't turn nothing down. Not that the king Nebuchadnezzar offering you, right? But they says they they said to come together, we going to purpose in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That no matter [screaming] what where we find ourselves at, we going to stay true to the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now that's having faith, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I begin to say, you got the purpose in your heart. No matter [screaming] what circumstance. See, circumstances come up. People get out of the word of God because the circumstance arose. Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "Well, God, understand this." How God Uhuh. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, we got so many examples. Circumstance arise. What you going to do? I'mma stay with the word. Hallelujah. Even upon death, [screaming] I'll stay with the word. &gt;&gt; No, he slay me. Yet, I'll trust him. I got faith. Hallelujah. In God. How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But they trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They purpose in their heart &gt;&gt; that no matter what. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; They was going to serve God, right? &gt;&gt; They says, "We won't eat the king's meat. Just give us this that and look at our countenance versus everybody else." &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "God can't bless you." God can bless [screaming] you. &gt;&gt; Come on. He can touch your body, right? He can heal you. He can walk supernatural, can't he? Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word. [screaming] Give me the word. Hallelujah. Right. Come on. And what happened? Theirs was fairer than everybody else, wasn't it? Come on. Choosing faith, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They they made that choice. We purposing our heart by choice. I'm I'm choosing, [screaming] right? &gt;&gt; To stay with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People got all kind of excuses why they don't stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All kind of excuses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why they don't live their life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we going to be held accountable on that day cuz we got so many clouds of witnesses that backs were against the wall, but [screaming] they stayed faithful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They chose faith, right? &gt;&gt; In the midst of fear, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Come on, Daniel and all those. Hallelujah. When Nebuchadnezzar dreamed that dream said, "If nobody can't interpret, I'm killing everybody in the morning." All the wise men, right? But there's something about it. Hallelujah. They begin praying because they knew who they go was. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. What seemed to be impossible, [screaming] that's when my God shows up. That's what he specializes in. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; So when the situation look hopeless, that's what my God specializes in. Something got to shake you in that moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In that moment of hopeless, something got to shake you. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, it's hopeless. [screaming] Oh, that's his po. That's his opportunity. That's when he shows up. when all the all of my everything is wiped out, that's when now that's when he shows up, right? Because why? When he does it, he want to make sure he gets the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He want to make sure that everybody know that was a miracle right there from God. Don't you realize that it was only God that done that? Don't you realize that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't you realize that was only God that done that? &gt;&gt; Come on. Sometimes Oh, it just No. Don't you realize it was only God that done that? &gt;&gt; Come on. But God showed him the dream. Daniel the dream interpreted. Oh, and when things seem impossible, but God specializes in that, don't he? Come on. So many times I was reading, looking at their little trials they were having. Come on. Oh, got made the image. We can go get in all that, but made the image and bow down and [screaming] worship all that. But those Hebrew boys, come on. They purpose in their heart no matter what. Fire, furnace, no matter what. Right. Come on. Look at the fire. You don't see that fire. &gt;&gt; Come on. They going to throw you in there. Right. You don't see [screaming] that? Look at that. Make your fear want it. Come on. I can look at the fire, but I know one thing. My God is the consuming fire. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. He's hotter than every fire. Right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Hot enough [screaming] to burn everything out of your life. Right. Come on. But when they looked at it, what they do? They began to say, "No fear grip them." Right. Come on. Well, we going to bring you before the king. Right. To see if you change your mind. See what it is. The devil trying to try you. Ain't it? Test you. Come on. Let [clears throat] me see if I can [screaming] get them. Show them a little more and see what they do. One thing about it I says all you got to do is stay with the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, I was sharing with the children the other day. I said, you know how you defeat the devil? Come on. It's written. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to argue do all that debate. You just How did Jesus defeat the devil? With the word, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Devil come to him. Hey, that's right.

Ain't it? &gt;&gt; But I find that it says that you know in the midst of them even with like I said in the fire and all that come bring they going to change their mind. But it's one thing I like how these boys says come on. Come on. Many people tremble even at the presence of King Nebuchadnezzar. Even the thought of him coming they tremble. Right now these boys got to stand before him and explain why they ain't bowing down to the image he set up. Come on. Why they ain't coming to do what he decreed. Right? But what they did, they chose faith, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They began to tell Nebuchadnezzar even there, right?

Did God tell you he was going to do it? No. But I know he's able. &gt;&gt; Come on. In their case, come on. In our case, God told us he'll do it, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Told us he'll provide. Come on. He told him to in a way, but I just said in that case, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He's able. &gt;&gt; King Oh, heated up seven times more. Right. Mad, right? But what it is? Faith. Faith overcame in that situation, didn't it? &gt;&gt; They chose faith over fear. Walked in the fire, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. But in [screaming] the fire, God was in there with him, wasn't he? Coming out with a testimony, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That am I went sin or whatever they call it, [screaming] I stood.

At that very moment where it looked like it would he wasn't going to do nothing, God stepped right in. Hallelujah. Right in [screaming] the fire, he stepped in. &gt;&gt; Come on. So many time after time I says but what it is you know I was thinking I says I won't be long this morning I was thinking I says you know I was at years ago and I like I like revisiting testimonies right because it stirs you up right I says you know what it is I was thinking about those Hebrew boys and how they had to stand before Nebuchadnezzar and go in the fire he was saying hey you don't bow down they said we ain't careful off you right they was bold wasn't they but I says you know one I remember once they wanted me to were not sh so bad. I ain't long I've been saved maybe a year or so. I want you to work second shift, whatever. They would have took me out of all the church service during the week, right? That that time, you know, the Lord done did doing so much for you, you on fire. I said, "What it is?" The devil and they offering you money to go to the next shift, right? And the devil said, "Oh, that's a blessing right there." Come on. Everything you think ain't a blessing ain't a blessing sometimes. &gt;&gt; See, what I was looking at at was a blessing. That God done cleaned me up. Amen. &gt;&gt; That God done brought me into the household of faith. That God is speaking to my soul. Hallelujah. That God is doing the miraculous in my life. I said God can do all things. Right. &gt;&gt; And I don't have to get out of his will to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You don't have to get out of God's will to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you can choose to stay with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. What it is, the devil want you to get out there cuz he know you get out there, then God ain't going to bless you outside of his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. He knows that. So what he try, what he wants you to do, get you on out there, offer all kind of things for you. But I remember I remember they saying, "We want you to work nights." And then they got to the point they going to force you. Had me go all the way up and talk to the uh plant manager, right? Hey, we need you to work nights. What's wrong? You know, you don't want the money, blah blah. I says, I begin to witness to him. I says, "You only know what God brought me from, what he did in my life, right? Come on." He says, "Well, what a why by this night, Tuesday night, Thursday night, you can't give up." I said, "One night, no." I said, "I got to Why you got to be there?" I said, "I got to be there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wasn't even preaching at the time. I said, "Got to be there." Cuz I was just so like it said, I was glad when they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; People ain't glad no more, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. I remember especially when back in those days we used to come uh know brother Sam, brother Adrian all we used to come and church uh prayer service didn't start the the 6 at that time I think it was we get out here 5:00 and then we started getting out here at 4:00 that was before we was married I ain't saying that that's why we stopped but [laughter] we we wasn't married then you you remember that over the other buildings but we we pull up I remember one time we pulled up to to the out there and and it was about 4:00. Brother Sam was driving that white van and brother Adrian driving a little red car at the time. We all pull up about the same time and we all jumped out the car and ran in the church. See who can get in there first to the altar. Come on. I was glad when they said unto me, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; I came running when they said unto me, &gt;&gt; did you run this morning? I ask people that all the time. Come on. But I says what it was. It was a joy to be down on your knees. &gt;&gt; Come on. We used to be over there in the side little building and playing tapes and listening, reading the Bible Saturday. It had nothing to do. Come out there. I mean, your whole life was built around the gospel. &gt;&gt; Come on. And God was doing things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was working. &gt;&gt; Come on. And what it is you say is God God didn't slack up. Where are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's right here. Come on. God [screaming] ain't slack concerning his promises. He's still there waiting on you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To get on fire again. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I remember then I says you know at that time he asked me I want want you to come. They say as well and I I began to tell him then then here you go. Uh you know I was thinking just now I said how the devil told Jesus you the son of God turn these stones into bread. He said man shall not live by bread alone by every word. Right. Oh okay. He said if you okay put you up here. He said, "I give you all the kings of the world. You bow down and worship me." It's written. Come on. He has no other gods for me. Him only shall I serve. Right. Oh, the devil going to get religious after that. Ain't he? I'm going use the word against him. Right. Huh? I throw you down. Ain't it written? Come on. Not the devil quoting scriptures. Come on. He cast you down. A get angel charging you. That's you dash your foot against his tongue. Come on. But one thing about Jesus, he was the word. You can't tangle him up, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't tangle them up. &gt;&gt; Come on. You said thou shall not tell him the Lord thy God. Right? Rebuke them. The devil had to leave cuz he saw that no matter what, I can't [screaming] get him off of that stance. &gt;&gt; And the devil will flee you too if you resist him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He will. He'll come try you, test you, but you resist the devil and watch he flee. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You got to resist him. &gt;&gt; Don't you? Hallelujah. But I remember telling me that say I says and he begin the the plant manager begin to say at the time he said earnest he say he says well God know you need this job he said God give you this job he know you need it you know pretty much said you don't think that you know and I told her at the time cuz I was bold back then wasn't married then either I don't think but I says hey I says God gave me this I he'll give me another one if it's his will. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I felt that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come what may. God bless me. He'll bless me again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't try to intimidate me. &gt;&gt; Right. It be spirits, &gt;&gt; right? No matter what, I'mma [screaming] stay with God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If I got to stand by myself, I'll stand with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Done had it with all your friends, family, everybody walk away from you. But one thing about it, in that lonely hour, that's when I found Jesus. Hallelujah. In that lonely times, &gt;&gt; that's when I found out he was a friend like no other. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, some people never had those moments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Never had that. They was too afraid to lose people, right? So they just like a reed shaking in the wind, right? &gt;&gt; The wind blow. They just Come on. But there's something about it. God don't want reeds shaking in the wind. &gt;&gt; He wants somebody called out. &gt;&gt; He want call you. He call you as an individual, right? &gt;&gt; He wants somebody that's going to say, "Yes, Lord. I believe you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll come if I got to come by myself. &gt;&gt; That sounds like a good song. People say, "I'll go if I got to go by myself." But when God call you, &gt;&gt; he separates you &gt;&gt; from friends. Sometimes he separates you from your wife or your husband. call you, &gt;&gt; walk before me. Hallelujah. And be thou perfect. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And watch the stand you take some time to save your significant other. Come on. But you got to be real, right? But I remember in that whole situation and I says what it is faith choosing faith over fear. And I walked out walking out the room the office and the plant manager and the superintendent said, "Hey man, come back in here." So I walked in there. They said, "Hey, what times you go to church?" And I told them and they said, "We really need you to work this other shift." They said, "So on the time those days, they said they give me enough time to clock out that I can go to church." I mean, give me enough time to go to church and come back to work. Give me a certain period of time on those days that I can go, right? And then I get leave out again. He said, "Hold up. Close the door." It says, "Uh, before they said, when you leave, don't worry about clocking out. We're going to pay you to go to church. Come on. [applause] What it was? That's the truth. Very, you remember that? That was the truth. Never miss a service here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm going to condemn myself here. Early praying, too. Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had the time in to get there early to pray, &gt;&gt; right? Cuz what it was, come on. You choosing, you ain't making no excuses, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm choosing faith over fear, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. There's so many angles I wanted to go with this, right? But I say it's what it is. Come on. It's so many so many things, right? With fear, especially with sicknesses. Come on. Especially with sickness. &gt;&gt; Because everybody going to give you a testimony against what the word of God say. &gt;&gt; Ain't but a few going to tell you to look up, right? &gt;&gt; Come on. Even you go to the doctor, you get the report from him, right? But one thing about it is God is going to be the only healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in those circumstances, you know, you do what you got to do. But one thing about it, you know, I know one thing, God is the only healer. &gt;&gt; Come on. In all, if if the work get done, God going to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God don't build keep the city, it ain't going to get kept. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. If God don't do it or man build, whatever, it'll get fall down. It ain't going to be no good. Right? But what God does is perfect. How many believe that this morning? Come on. But you got an opportunity, right, to choose. &gt;&gt; Come on. Faith. what you going to do? so many uh uh examples in the scriptures and that's why Paul I took too long but I want to really go there and break down in in Romans 8 how he was saying in in Nate let let's can we read that Romans 8 and28 I know I'm winning along I don't really go long Romans 8 and 28 I think it is &gt;&gt; nay in all things &gt;&gt; I'm waiting on it who got it [laughter] y'all forgive me say we know that all things work together for the good of them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "For whom he did forno, he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moreever, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, he called, he justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. Who what shall we say then to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? You know, one thing about it, God, you go to the next verse, right? You know, one thing about it, God, God did the work. That's why he's laying that that foundation there. You know, it's God that done it. God, he already called, justified your glory. All he says, and we saying, who what shall we say in these things? If God be for us, come on. Who can be against? Say he separated us from not of his own son, but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? says, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that die, yay, rather that risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, swore?" says, "As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter." Nay, in all these things. Come on. Come on. Somebody is saying all these things. &gt;&gt; All these things. &gt;&gt; Come on. You got to choose faith over fear. He didn't say you wouldn't have trials. Paul talked about them. Persecution, peril, sword. Oh, no. He talking about we killed all day long. It's written. Come on. He didn't talk about you wouldn't have adversities, right? But one thing about it, he's letting you know. Come on, those things come. Don't have fear, right? &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. He said in all these things, we are what? &gt;&gt; Come on. We just conquerors. &gt;&gt; We more than, right? &gt;&gt; Not just conqueror, we more. Like they said, we more than able. We more. Halle Hallelujah. How are we more? Because God is fighting our battles. &gt;&gt; Because God is out in the forefront. It ain't us, but [screaming] it's him. Hallelujah. We more than conquerors, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Through who? Through [screaming] him &gt;&gt; that loved us. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said it's Christ that died rather than rise again. It's him that's making intercession for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I believe in one place he was talk talking about. Come on. I fought a good fight. I finished the course. Right. I kept the faith. Come on. &gt;&gt; Had trials [screaming] but I kept the faith. &gt;&gt; Right. People walked away from you. Talked about you. Had storms, wind blowing. Amen. &gt;&gt; My hardest times, right? &gt;&gt; Felt like giving up, [screaming] but I kept it, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many feel like keeping it this morning? &gt;&gt; Come on. But what it is, I said, you got to choose faith. &gt;&gt; Come on. You got to choose it. Remember that. You got to choose it over fear. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I thought a slaughter of the song I just wrote in my head.
