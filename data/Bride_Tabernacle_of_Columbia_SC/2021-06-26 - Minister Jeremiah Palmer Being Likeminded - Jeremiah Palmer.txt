name of jesus christ amen and amen how many appreciate the lord tonight amen i had a little shelter tells the one right before you turn to the book of philippians the second chapter of philippians and uh give you a little short testimony one of the brothers bob there at the church day marion what i've been actually going to pray for he was suffering with cancer and he had um two rising one was real big on one side and other was getting big on the other side and he also was suffering with his stomach was enlarged with it was kind of affection um that he was dealing with and they diagnosed with cancer and he tell me a lot of times that he couldn't sleep at night at all basically he sits up sleeping and about one or two hours a night and i talked to him yesterday he was at the hospital leaving the hospital and going home and he said he was kind of still kind of shortness of breath he's doing some chemo but he was saying that both of the rising has been has gone and his stomach had then went out so i said he was just praising the lord he said you see sunday brother jeremiah it's gone it's gone so i said well thank the lord amen amen knowing that god is still a waymaker amen appreciate that in jesus christ's name because philippians the second chapter one through five if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through scrift or vainglory but in lowliness of mind that each esteem others better than themselves look not on every man or his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let us pray father we thank you for the reading of your word sanctified in jesus name amen may be seated just for a few minutes tonight i was reading the book of romans where i actually started from romans 15. and it's kind of caught my attention and i thought you know that it may be something to be of just exalt for a few minutes tonight and i entitled it like-minded like-minded when you think of mine webster says having a like disposition or purpose of the same mind or habit of thought having a like disposition or purpose as we read it and i was thinking on the early church in the very life of jesus christ which i believe is our prime example paul said he had to let this mind be in us that was in christ and i like it because he said that having the same love in other words the love of god in the love of god is it partial the bible says for god so love the world he gave his only begotten son not a respectable person that god just but he died for the sins of the whole world he gave himself even for those that will reject him in other words he would display that i just didn't come for the righteous or for this but he gave everybody an opportunity to accept the love that he had and that's why he gave his life if you notice his very life was a life of sacrifice he didn't come uh high and mighty or for a certain sec a certain group but he came from those that are without he was the very expression of god and god is love the love of god conscrained him to did what he did not for himself but he did it for us everything that ever was done everything that was written you know he had a purpose in it he was expressing to us god love for humanity and that love he had for humanity that he wanted to express that uh how much that he went and how far he went to redeem us from the penalty of sin and i believe that here paul talking about having the same mind in romans 12 it also said that uh let your mind be transformed the renewing of your mind there's a a renewing of our mind that god wants to give us another mind setting here he flipping said that not don't think on your own self but think on others that's sometime is a a a place that we get stuck because seemingly we all hung up on ourselves we always talking about what i want what i need but have you ever consider somebody else what you want and what you trying to achieve and yet you know all that you have you fail to understand that there's somebody don't even have half of what you have but i know it takes the mind of god to be able to understand that our very life are to be aligned a life that we live for our neighbors who is your neighbor everywhere you go you meet people you see people you communicate with people sometimes we uh like to always um the mindsetting that most people have not saying we have here but it's just that we look on the good folks everybody that's already saved but how about that one that don't even know jesus christ how about that one that never even heard of a savior how about that one that don't even know that he can be rescued see that's when the mind of god becomes to be so evident but i know it's something that has to be in your heart it's something that come with when god when you really understand that love that he had even for you and we know what kind of shape we were in we know that if god didn't come and see about us where will we be tonight i look at myself sometime and i really you know it really gets to me you know because uh i know that if it wasn't for god mercy how would i ever be able you know to even hold my head up if it wasn't for the grace of god how would i be able to live with my own self knowing how wretched and undone i were then god came way down and picked me up somebody said he had to reach way down to get me out of the mess that i was in what did it it was his love and then we can really appreciate when you really understand i was telling my children a little study you know trying to just uh share the love and what it really meant and i was telling i said you know if you can ever obtain the love of god that is so rich in your heart then it can flow out of you and the son of god said that's what the world is looking for the love of god i mean the real love love that don't look at what you got love that look at no matter what you drive or where you live at or what clothes you wear but a love to let you know that you know there's hope even though you may be in a bad condition but god can deliver i know that you we get so low in ourself and things that happen especially now but yet still there is grace but having the mind-setting when you see those that are without what kind of mind setting do you have you know what i'm finding you know we all know this that some of the time some of the religious folks sometimes is some of the worst because the way they think about others as long as uh if they're not in our little inner circle if they're less than they're not in the message then we can't hardly relate to them but how they ever gonna come to it if you don't have the love of god in your heart see because i'm saying for god so loved the world he loved everybody even if you notice even judas jesus called him friend friend knowing he was a deceiver knowing he was the one that was going to betray him he treated him no different he was one of the disciples casting out devils and along with the rest of them and he didn't hate he didn't say oh i know you the devil get out of here even though he knew what he was going to do but yet you know he knew that the love of god you know was so great that he can love even his enemy i believe some places are written they're saying if you love them that love you what good is that don't the publican the same but how about loving those that don't care nothing for you loving the unlovable those that persecute you and ridicule you can you have a compassion for them you know even though you know because see when you are under the influence and the powers of satan you know you uh uh may not even be aware what really is going on with you now as many of us out of that condition we can look and see you wonder why did i even do such a thing because of the powers and the principalities of the air had our minds blinded but when god opened up your eyes of understanding you realize i don't have to live like that but what you heard about the gospel of jesus christ you heard how he made a way for you and you understood that if you continue the way you were going you were going to be destroyed and it's like this what could you lose you were already in a mess the world already you know man the our only way out is to accept what jesus did for us at calvary so when jesus was here you know if you notice he didn't went to the church folks when he did met him they called him a devil they ridiculed him for what he was doing don't he know what man of people he's dealing with they saw him eating with the sinners and things like that and they could understand if he's supposed to be a king why is he associating with those in other words low-life people but the bible said that you know he uh came to the common people and they heard him gladly they were glad that somebody took the time out to let them know that you know you can come out of this situation no doubt when jesus fame began to grow up on the earth and the religious folks saw that the people began to follow him it disturbed their church because he was a man that posed to be a king and a teacher a rabbi and here he is associating with you know those that were sick and demonic pressed and all kind of like that but that's what he came to do but it was a mindset he had the mind of god that's why we need the mind of god we need a very heart of god the love of god i i mean i'm i'm really talking about that love that uh constrains you to go the extra mile go beyond you know because we have little limits you know i'll go but so far but wait a minute but god went the whole he went beyond what we could even give him back but he gave it all god came left heaven to give us eternal life and to give us his spirit that we can have the same type mind that he had what mind is that the mind to do the will of the father to reach out to those that are without it's not our business worry about whether they're going to receive it or not you just pour out the love you never know what god will do you may not see it then but after a while i believe that if it's genuine that god love withdrawal don't don't have a measuring stick with your love but go all the way with them go to extra sometimes we have to go out our route it takes a wise man in one soul because the world has saw so much religious hypocrisy of a christianity debacle don't have no more hope because the church has failed why because they can't express the true love of god only through the holy ghost servant god said one of the evidence of the holy ghost is love when you can love in spite of yes you'll be mistreated yes you'll be hurt yes you'll be talked about but love anyhow love overrides if your love can't override faults and mistakes you see all of us got mistakes but with the love of god it overflow all that i look beyond your mistakes and i know you don't mean to do that you may get anointed by a little spirit you may say a little something but yeah i might feel a little better but i'll be all right i'm not going to hold no grudge against you i'm not going to cross the street when i see you i turn my back i'm going to say praise the lord sister and if i can lift you up if you're wounded i wanna say is there anything i could do to help i know i've went several times and tried to uh reach some people that have backslid and what are the man thing they've been saying this you know what they say not one person trying to even reach out you know because they don't know what the real cause see we don't know the cause what happens in people's life see things happen sometime that we don't have no idea we think oh there they go again just cutting up you remember that woman at the well how many of y'all want to sit with her and have fellowship with her had six husbands five and living with the sixth one she was the talk of the city did you think anybody really understood that she was a predestinated seed of god they looked at what she did and what she was doing served to god said she may had to make a living for her family or something yes it was wrong but see that's why i love about god he he looks beyond what we do and what we did and god looks deep and that's why jesus left take this up y'all go ahead in the city i got to go by samaria he told the preacher y'all go ahead on because they wouldn't understood what he's about to do the father led him samaria for one seed at this particular time at that day that woman that was a predestinated seed met jesus oh did she know she was going to meet him no sir did you know when you were going to meet god but god had a particular time he said i had need to go by samaria i had need to go by columbia or georgia or florida or aching or whatever i had me why because there was a seed of mine there yeah they heard about religion but i'm gonna do something that they'll know who i am this woman she heard about the things of god but when she met jesus in person oh that's what we need we need to meet god in person and when you meet him like that nothing can turn you around i'm glad i didn't meet god in church i met him in a club i say this he came to me huh did not god god serve god say you don't come god found you he knew where you were some of you even some bad houses but god still came there he came in the liquor houses the crack houses the prostitute house he didn't matter god don't have no limits when you were here i'm gonna get you you might have been running a long time but god said now it's time aren't you glad tonight oh that god didn't gave up on you but then why you want to give up on somebody else come on let's not give up on people let's do all we can with the love of god in our heart to bring them back to jesus christ god bless you tonight [Applause] praise the lord amen don't give up on your brothers and sisters amen go get that last one amen we have to find them amen jesus left the 99 and he went to look for that one praise god amen you know sometimes i we get we get impatient with one another and we just say well then forget it i'm gonna stop praying i'm gonna stop trusting but you gotta keep praying amen some of the places and some of the things we have done in our lives god should have said no hope for that person amen but he never gave looked down on who we were and what we were doing but he saw our needs and he knew deep down in the inside there was a deep calling to the deep he knew as a as brother palmer was saying he knew that that woman was a predestinated seed he knew if she had the opportunity she'll take advantage of the opportunity all she needed was an opportunity somebody that would care enough hallelujah that was concerned about her soul oh when you're convinced you'll get concerned hallelujah confess and then concern hallelujah i'm so glad that he was concerned about you and i that he didn't leave us where we were have you ever thought about where you were when he found you you were headed when he found you somebody said he turned me around i'm so glad he found me praise god i didn't find him he said well thy adam praise god he said i'm hiding why are you hiding he said because i'm naked praise god how naked we were for all things are naked and open before the eyes of him and whom we have to do how naked we were how undone we were praise god but yet god reached out he came down and said i'm coming to get you he didn't leave us in the state he found us in but he got praise god a covering from adam he covets praise god their sins now he's come to take away our sins not to covet but to take it away thank god
