[45:45] the Book of Genesis 1.
[45:49] appreciate the Saints uh making it up
[45:51] this morning
[45:55] amen
[45:59] brother Gordon and sister
[46:01] Rachel had a episode with the door
[46:05] I said Lord thank the lord we could get
[46:07] in the building amen
[46:09] amen
[46:11] man God is good
[46:13] if you haven't say man
[46:16] Genesis 1
[46:18] and one
[46:20] in the beginning God created the heavens
[46:24] and the Earth
[46:27] and the Earth was without form and void
[46:30] and darkness was upon the face of the
[46:33] deep
[46:34] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[46:36] face of the waters
[46:38] and God said let there be light and
[46:40] there was light
[46:43] and God saw the light that it was good
[46:46] and God divided the light from the
[46:49] darkness
[46:50] and God called the light D and the
[46:52] Darkness he called night
[46:55] and the evening in the morning were the
[46:57] first day
[46:58] may the Lord had a blessing to the
[47:00] reason that this word you may be seated
[47:02] I thought this morning
[47:05] identified Christ
[47:07] of all ages
[47:09] identified Christ
[47:12] of all ages
[47:14] so we look to be identified
[47:17] of Christ in this age
[47:20] and as I read the scriptures he called
[47:22] the light day and the Darkness he called
[47:25] night
[47:26] and when you look at what that word
[47:29] identified
[47:32] that word identified means to be like
[47:35] something
[47:36] a image of something
[47:38] so when you're walking do the through
[47:41] the day
[47:42] you have a shadow or image of yourself
[47:45] so identify a Christ of all ages as we
[47:49] look in the word we want to see Jesus
[47:53] and we want to look like him
[47:55] we want to be like him and we want to
[47:58] act like him
[47:59] so any way that we are acting that is
[48:02] not like him is not identifying
[48:04] ourselves right
[48:06] John 1.
[48:08] Saint John 1.
[48:13] and I don't want to move too fast
[48:14] sometimes I move a little fast Saint
[48:16] John 1 and 1.
[48:19] he says in the beginning was the word
[48:22] and the Word was with God
[48:24] and the Word was God
[48:27] the same was in the beginning with God
[48:30] all things were made by him
[48:33] and without him was not anything made
[48:36] so this morning each and every one of us
[48:38] was made by God
[48:41] in him was life
[48:43] and the life was the light of men
[48:46] and the light shineth in darkness and
[48:49] the Darkness comprehended it not
[48:52] so to this morning if we're going to
[48:55] comprehend the things of God we have to
[48:58] be in the light
[48:59] we have to be part of the light
[49:03] and there was a man sent from God whose
[49:06] name was John
[49:08] the same came for a witness to Bear
[49:11] witness of the light that all men
[49:13] through him might believe
[49:15] he was not that light but was sent to
[49:18] Bear witness of that light
[49:19] see we are not that light but we come to
[49:22] Bear witness of that light
[49:24] and when we bear witness of the True
[49:27] Light that's Jesus then we'll draw men
[49:30] to Christ
[49:31] that was the light that lighteth every
[49:34] man that cometh into the world
[49:36] he was in the world and the world was
[49:38] made by him and the world knew him not
[49:41] he came unto his own and his own
[49:44] received him not
[49:46] but as many as received him to them gave
[49:48] he power to become the sons of God
[49:52] even to them that believe on his name
[49:55] which were born not of blood
[49:58] not of the will of the flesh nor the
[50:01] will of man but of God
[50:04] so identify Christ of this age we're
[50:07] looking at a birth
[50:10] we're looking at something that
[50:12] identifies you with his word
[50:15] so if you are identified with his word
[50:18] this morning I don't get too excited
[50:19] because I I want to teach this morning
[50:21] if you identified with his word then you
[50:24] will look like Christ
[50:26] you will look like the word
[50:29] Hebrews 1.
[50:34] God who had sun-dried times and in
[50:36] diverse manners she speaking time paths
[50:39] unto the fathers by the prophets
[50:43] helping these last days spoken to us by
[50:45] his son who have appointed heir of all
[50:48] things
[50:49] who've been who may who also made the
[50:52] worlds who being the brightness of his
[50:54] glory and the express image of his
[50:57] person
[50:58] of holding All Things by the word of his
[51:01] power
[51:01] and when he had by himself purged
[51:05] our sins sat down on the right hand of
[51:07] God and the right hand of the Majesty on
[51:09] high being made so much better than the
[51:13] angels as he by inheritance obtain a
[51:16] more excellent Name than they
[51:18] For unto the Angels which he said
[51:21] at any time thought might son this day
[51:24] have I begotten thee and again I will be
[51:27] to him a father and he should be to me a
[51:30] son and again when he bringeth the first
[51:32] begotten into the world he saith and let
[51:34] all the angels of God worship Him
[51:37] so as we are identifying ourselves with
[51:40] Christ we are looking at the mirror the
[51:44] word and we're looking and the word is
[51:46] our mirror we are identifying ourselves
[51:49] in such a way that Jesus is in US
[51:54] how he's in us this morning
[51:56] he's in Us by his word
[51:58] you know I tell the church I said if you
[52:00] want to get closer to God read your
[52:02] Bible and pray every day
[52:05] but when you it's it's where you are
[52:08] dwelling at
[52:10] my subtopic today is where you are
[52:13] living
[52:16] identify Christ of all ages there are
[52:18] three places that you are living at one
[52:21] of the places is justification that's
[52:24] the outer quotes and then you got the
[52:25] Intercourse which is sanctification and
[52:27] then you have the wholeness of wholeness
[52:29] is where you are dwelling at
[52:32] a man that I was working on last
[52:34] Thursday it's the manner that you were
[52:37] eating is the same manner but it's where
[52:40] you are keeping yourself
[52:43] that's what God is looking for
[52:46] when you're eating the Manna is where
[52:48] you are eating at
[52:50] you're in the Tabernacle and it's where
[52:52] you are eating the manna
[52:55] see
[52:57] Jesus said in Isaiah 53 he said I
[53:01] Justified many
[53:02] many he justified her but we must go
[53:05] beyond justification
[53:08] is where you are eating the same manner
[53:11] that you were eating but if you were
[53:12] eating any justification it's going to
[53:15] go bad and you're gonna have to get new
[53:17] Mana
[53:19] sanctification it's the holy place is
[53:22] where you are eating the Manna it
[53:25] increases your faith you're clean and
[53:27] you're holy
[53:28] but that manner still dies
[53:31] it has worms in it but in the most holy
[53:35] place the Tabernacle
[53:37] is where the manner never goes bad
[53:41] so now you are on the mountain top all
[53:45] the time
[53:46] you are on the
[53:48] Mount Sinai as you say
[53:51] so it's where you are eating the manna
[53:54] where you are placed at in the
[53:57] Tabernacle
[53:59] sometimes I'm saved sometimes I'm not
[54:01] saved you know that's where it is but
[54:04] when you are in the most holy place
[54:06] there's the manner never goes bad
[54:11] Hebrews 10 and 7.
[54:17] the Lord had me deal with this to let
[54:19] people know where we are at
[54:22] why I have so much trouble trying to
[54:24] live a Christian Life why I have so much
[54:27] trouble to doing this and doing that why
[54:29] I I got I got faith and then the next
[54:32] minute I don't have faith
[54:34] I'm venturing without Authority I got
[54:36] all faith today and tomorrow I'm sad I'm
[54:39] on the I'm on I'm in the dumps
[54:42] Hebrews 10 and 7.
[54:46] he said then low said I come in the
[54:49] volume of the book
[54:51] it is written of me to do thy will o God
[54:55] and above when he says sacrifices and
[54:58] offerings and burnt offers and offerings
[55:00] for sin Thy word is not neither have
[55:03] pleasure therein which are offered by
[55:06] the law
[55:08] then said he lo I come to do thy will oh
[55:11] God he taketh away the first that he may
[55:14] establish the second now let's go to
[55:16] verse 19.
[55:18] having therefore brethren
[55:21] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[55:23] the blood of Jesus
[55:26] have boldness have therefore Brethren
[55:29] boldness to any to the holy that's where
[55:32] we supposed to be in the most holy place
[55:35] that's where we're supposed to dwell
[55:39] to the holiest by the blood of Jesus by
[55:41] New and Living Way which he has
[55:43] consecrated for us through the veil that
[55:46] is to say his flesh so the more you read
[55:48] your Bible the more you pray you
[55:50] entering into the holy place the most
[55:52] holy place and that is where you abide
[55:56] that is where your faith cannot be
[55:59] touched that is where the supernatural
[56:01] takes place
[56:03] right there in that place where God is
[56:06] dwelling with you
[56:08] Aaron went back there one year
[56:12] with a dead stick
[56:15] he passed through justification
[56:17] the stick was still dead
[56:19] he passed through sanctification it was
[56:21] still dead
[56:22] but when he left it back there by
[56:25] accident in the most holy place
[56:28] Glory
[56:30] begin the butt almonds uh a dead stick
[56:33] back day in the most holy place it begin
[56:36] to live
[56:38] church do you understand what I'm saying
[56:39] it's living back there you must get back
[56:42] there if you want eternal life
[56:49] these are coming the volume of the book
[56:51] he come that the veil may be rent in
[56:55] Twain from top to bottom that you you
[56:57] don't need the pastor the Deacon or the
[56:59] trustee you can enter into the holies of
[57:02] holies yourself that's why the Bible
[57:04] says in Revelation he has made us Kings
[57:07] and Priests what a king do he has a
[57:09] kingdom and what a priest does he has a
[57:13] service he's wrapped in my around the
[57:15] waist he is in service for the Lord
[57:20] second Corinthians
[57:22] 5 and 14.
[57:33] For the Love of Christ constraineth us
[57:36] because we that we just judge that if
[57:39] one died for all then we're all dead
[57:43] and that he died for all that he which
[57:46] live should not henceforth live unto
[57:49] themselves
[57:50] see God don't want you to live unto
[57:52] yourself he wants you to live in him
[57:56] self but unto him which died for them
[57:59] and rose again
[58:02] you're living for him you died and you
[58:05] Rigamortis set in and you're living for
[58:07] him
[58:12] oh they die that died which shall live
[58:15] wherefore henceforth now know we no man
[58:18] after the flesh yay though we have known
[58:22] Christ after the flesh yet now
[58:24] henceforth know we him no more
[58:27] so you don't know no man after the flesh
[58:29] once he's born again
[58:31] once he's died death bell and
[58:33] Resurrection he died you've died to the
[58:36] things of the world it's you got to
[58:38] examine where you are living and once
[58:41] you examine where you are living then
[58:43] you can move forward
[58:46] see the Tabernacle has furniture all
[58:49] through
[58:51] I the fact that Tabernacle in
[58:53] justification position in place certain
[58:56] Furniture in justification
[58:59] and you can't stay there you must pass
[59:02] through to sanctification and there are
[59:04] certain Furniture in sanctification to
[59:06] bring it all to the sacrifice the
[59:09] Candlestick but you can't stop there you
[59:12] must go Beyond the Veil and when you go
[59:15] Beyond the Veil the curtain drops behind
[59:17] you
[59:18] and when the curtain drops behind you
[59:20] then it's you and God not nobody else in
[59:24] the church
[59:25] not your mother not your father not your
[59:27] brother not your sister not your husband
[59:28] your wife then the cotton drops then
[59:31] it's you and God together and now that's
[59:35] the revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[59:37] personally
[59:39] that is why the Bible says if thou shall
[59:41] confess without mouth the Lord Jesus and
[59:43] believe in thy heart that God has
[59:44] raising from the dead thou shall be
[59:47] saved
[59:48] with the heart the man believeth unto
[59:50] righteousness and see when God touch you
[59:54] and take you into that most holy place
[59:57] you want to go back there
[59:59] that is where life is that is whether
[1:00:02] understanding of the blood of Jesus
[1:00:05] that is where the righteousness of God
[1:00:07] is
[1:00:08] and once you go back there you'll never
[1:00:10] be the same
[1:00:13] you will never be the same and when you
[1:00:15] come out of there you can only love one
[1:00:18] another
[1:00:19] no matter what takes place in your life
[1:00:22] you are loved with guppy love why no
[1:00:25] matter how somebody treats you you're
[1:00:26] going to continue to love them
[1:00:29] I thank the Lord for his grace
[1:00:32] me and brother Johnny was dealing with
[1:00:34] some some family members that's real
[1:00:36] religious
[1:00:38] and I didn't know which way to go
[1:00:40] and my wife said you don't met your
[1:00:42] match now
[1:00:43] your cousin boy I tell you she
[1:00:46] is a preacher preachers
[1:00:48] ain't no scripture she don't know in the
[1:00:50] Bible
[1:00:51] she can't let she won't let me talk yeah
[1:00:53] I can't get an inch on her and she said
[1:00:55] pastor you are the greatest I said he
[1:00:58] said nothing you did all the talking
[1:01:00] and we prayed for
[1:01:02] she's going to court
[1:01:04] and the judge looked at it last week and
[1:01:06] thrown it out of court and she called me
[1:01:07] three four times and me and my wife
[1:01:10] looking at the phone I said should I
[1:01:11] answered
[1:01:13] I said I don't know that's a glory to
[1:01:15] God
[1:01:16] she's I'm just going to talk with you a
[1:01:17] minute pastor
[1:01:19] clue of family her daughters went to
[1:01:21] school with me so I'm just gonna talk a
[1:01:23] minute with you I answered the phone she
[1:01:25] talked hour and a half
[1:01:28] glory to God I talked with her yesterday
[1:01:30] she said I'm just going to talk with you
[1:01:31] man I called you yesterday
[1:01:33] she just said praise the Lord and was on
[1:01:35] the phone four minutes
[1:01:36] she's a pastor I thank you but the Holy
[1:01:39] Spirit revealed to me
[1:01:41] me and brother Johnny was dealing with
[1:01:43] her both of our family members
[1:01:46] and the Holy Spirit said
[1:01:48] she's in a place you can't help her
[1:01:51] he said but pray for her as a family
[1:01:52] member and love as a sister in Christ
[1:01:56] she's almost the age of my mom
[1:01:59] but I'ma tell you her her brain is like
[1:02:02] photographic memory
[1:02:04] as you put most preachers to shame
[1:02:06] the way you preach and talk
[1:02:09] but I said goodness of Grace she said
[1:02:12] when you came down to preaching
[1:02:14] something at the church either one told
[1:02:16] the pastor to bring you down there
[1:02:19] I said thank the Lord
[1:02:21] I love her with everything in me but I
[1:02:23] can't talk to her
[1:02:25] amen so the holy spirit said this is
[1:02:28] where I positionly placed her
[1:02:30] you can help her from a distance only
[1:02:33] ensure love
[1:02:36] and God revealed that to me yesterday in
[1:02:39] prayer with me and brother John at the
[1:02:40] church prayer and I told him that's
[1:02:42] where God
[1:02:43] reveal and see once once you get back
[1:02:47] into that Holy place that most holy
[1:02:49] place
[1:02:50] it ain't normal you
[1:02:52] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] personally to you
[1:02:56] and once the word is revealed to you
[1:02:58] then now he'll make known unto you the
[1:03:01] riches of his glory
[1:03:03] which is Christ in you
[1:03:06] and that unction which is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:08] which is the life of God coming inside
[1:03:10] of you revealing to you the things that
[1:03:13] are taking place and the scriptures
[1:03:17] look what he says wherefore
[1:03:20] here henceforth no no weed man no more
[1:03:23] after the flesh do we have known Christ
[1:03:25] after the flesh yet now no we hits him
[1:03:28] no more therefore If any man be in
[1:03:31] Christ
[1:03:32] he's a new creature
[1:03:34] he's a new creature
[1:03:36] old things are passed away behold All
[1:03:38] Things become new
[1:03:40] all things of God who have reconciled us
[1:03:43] by himself to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:03:46] and has given us the ministry of
[1:03:49] reconciliation
[1:03:50] so God reconciled you in Christ
[1:03:54] that's the reason the atonement was made
[1:03:58] to reconcile you back in Christ see the
[1:04:01] atonement was that when his blood was
[1:04:04] shed for you he'll turn a calorie now
[1:04:07] your blood no good my blood no good
[1:04:09] nobody blood no good but the atoning
[1:04:12] grace of the blood of Jesus when it was
[1:04:14] shed you could come boldly before the
[1:04:17] throne of grace as Hebrews said and find
[1:04:19] help in a time of trouble so now the
[1:04:22] blood that was spilled 2 000 years ago
[1:04:25] has not lost any power to save it can
[1:04:28] save to the atomosa because Isaiah said
[1:04:31] you have believed our report and to who
[1:04:35] the arm of the Lord been revealed he
[1:04:37] should grow up as a tender plant and a
[1:04:39] root out of dry ground and there's no
[1:04:41] formal covenants that we should see of
[1:04:43] him but we was wounded for our
[1:04:45] transgressions he would bruise for you
[1:04:47] and our iniquities the chastisement of
[1:04:49] our peace was upon him and with his
[1:04:51] stripes you were healed
[1:04:54] and it's not just physical healing it's
[1:04:57] spiritual healing this morning God is
[1:05:00] spiritually healing you this morning
[1:05:01] because the blood of Jesus
[1:05:05] and when you accept that blood the
[1:05:08] atoning of that blood your sins has been
[1:05:10] pardoned through the blood of Christ
[1:05:15] that's why Peter can say with the blood
[1:05:17] of God and Paul could say it was the
[1:05:19] blood of Christ because he met him on
[1:05:21] the road to the Masters in Acts 9. he
[1:05:24] didn't see Jesus in the flesh but he saw
[1:05:26] him in Christ
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:29] amen
[1:05:31] look what he says therefore If any man
[1:05:34] be in Christ
[1:05:36] he's a new creature old things will pass
[1:05:40] away behold All Things become new
[1:05:42] so when you are in Christ
[1:05:45] then there's something First Corinthians
[1:05:48] 12 and 13 said by one Spirit we all
[1:05:50] baptize into one body
[1:05:52] we are in the body of Christ not in the
[1:05:55] church physically but you're in body of
[1:05:58] Christ you are baptized into that body
[1:06:00] by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] and if you're not baptized into that
[1:06:07] body then you're not in that body
[1:06:11] Romans 12 and 1 said therefore brethren
[1:06:14] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[1:06:16] mercies of God
[1:06:17] that you present your bodies as a Living
[1:06:19] Sacrifice
[1:06:21] holy and acceptable unto God
[1:06:24] which is your reasonable for service
[1:06:27] and be not conformed to this world
[1:06:30] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:06:32] of your mind that you may prove what is
[1:06:34] a good and acceptable and perfect will
[1:06:36] of God see your mind is not going to
[1:06:39] tell you what is right
[1:06:40] Proverbs says your heart is wickedly and
[1:06:43] deceitful Above All Things who can know
[1:06:45] it but when you get Jesus inside of you
[1:06:48] will you get the Holy Ghost in you
[1:06:50] that's why he told Nicodemus you're a
[1:06:53] rule of the Jews but you must be born
[1:06:55] again and Nicodemus didn't understand
[1:06:57] what he said but he was a smart man he
[1:06:59] had a doctorate degree he said you must
[1:07:01] be gone born again and he said it's wind
[1:07:04] blood red listen and I'll hear the sound
[1:07:06] there but can't tell what's it here
[1:07:08] comes oh yes go so is everyone that is
[1:07:11] born of the spirit
[1:07:12] so the spirit of Christ will lead you
[1:07:15] into all truth John 16 and 13 say he the
[1:07:20] spirit of Truth has come he will not
[1:07:22] speak nothing of himself but he only see
[1:07:25] what the word says
[1:07:32] and all things of God who have
[1:07:33] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:07:36] and has given us the minister of
[1:07:37] reconciliation to which that God was in
[1:07:40] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:07:42] not imputing their trespasses unto
[1:07:44] themselves and have committed unto us
[1:07:46] the word of reconciliation
[1:07:48] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[1:07:53] so if you're an ambassador for Christ
[1:07:55] you shouldn't be ashamed of it
[1:07:58] you should be able to tell somebody
[1:07:59] about it
[1:08:00] an ambassador of U.N Nations United
[1:08:03] States Senate Ambassador over to Russia
[1:08:05] he's in representative for U.S
[1:08:08] so if you had an ambassador for Christ
[1:08:10] you are his God's Representatives on
[1:08:13] this Earth so wherever you go whoever
[1:08:15] you talk to is Christ
[1:08:18] you don't talk about what you've done
[1:08:19] your ministry it is Christ you talk
[1:08:21] about why because Christ is the one that
[1:08:24] brought you out of darkness and
[1:08:26] translated you into the kingdom of his
[1:08:28] dear son
[1:08:30] that's what Colossians 1 says you've
[1:08:32] translated us out of Darkness into the
[1:08:34] kingdom of his dear son and if you're in
[1:08:36] his kingdom then your part of his
[1:08:38] kingdom so now you are an ambassador for
[1:08:40] Christ
[1:08:42] and he is the word
[1:08:45] for he that made him to be sin for us
[1:08:49] that that knew no sin that we might be
[1:08:53] made the righteousness of God in him
[1:08:55] so you are made the righteousness of God
[1:08:57] in him
[1:08:58] so it's no more you do what you want to
[1:09:01] do is Christ in you you're doing what
[1:09:04] Christ is saying you're doing what the
[1:09:06] word's saying John 15.
[1:09:09] John 15.
[1:09:11] you're doing what Christ is saying
[1:09:14] you doing what the word's saying
[1:09:19] John 15.
[1:09:24] John 15 and 26.
[1:09:30] I'm gonna read something here though the
[1:09:32] Lutheran Age come forth the judge shall
[1:09:35] live by faith that's the outer courts
[1:09:38] Along come the method is aged which is
[1:09:40] sanctification
[1:09:42] came the second definite work of Grace
[1:09:46] which came in that age that was under
[1:09:49] the altar age
[1:09:51] see the altar is the heart
[1:09:53] and then in the last days the
[1:09:56] restoration of the Holy Spirit the
[1:09:58] hidden life
[1:10:01] and I'm sure right there is where the
[1:10:03] trouble lies
[1:10:08] I want you to see it
[1:10:11] said most Christians can't deviate
[1:10:13] between the most holy place and the holy
[1:10:16] place
[1:10:18] the sanctification they live a clean
[1:10:20] life
[1:10:21] but the spirit of God has to fill you up
[1:10:24] the cup has come out of justification
[1:10:26] it's cleaned up
[1:10:28] it's washed
[1:10:30] then it's set out for service
[1:10:32] but not in service
[1:10:35] the Holy Spirit has to fill it up
[1:10:38] that's why Ezekiel 36 said I give you a
[1:10:41] new spirit
[1:10:42] to dwell with your spirit see some
[1:10:44] people so mean as the devil
[1:10:46] some people this is mean as the devil
[1:10:48] they can't even cope with themselves
[1:10:49] they're just so mean and nasty he said
[1:10:51] I'll give you a new spirit to deal with
[1:10:53] your spirit because you're so mean no no
[1:10:55] love is there just pure hatred and mean
[1:10:59] and then he said once you deal with that
[1:11:01] Spirit then I'll put my spirit in you
[1:11:03] Ezekiel talks about in John Joel 2 and
[1:11:06] 28. then I'll put my spirit in you see
[1:11:09] the new spirit is not your spirit
[1:11:11] and the new spirit is not the Holy
[1:11:13] Spirit but he'll give you a new spirit
[1:11:15] to deal with your spirit in
[1:11:16] sanctification until you get your life
[1:11:18] and you totally surrender to God then
[1:11:21] he'll send his spirit
[1:11:23] and then his Spirit a commandment
[1:11:27] a cup of obedience to the spirit of
[1:11:30] Christ then
[1:11:31] you see the spirit of
[1:11:33] Spirit of Christ
[1:11:34] The Works of the flesh which are
[1:11:36] manifested which are these
[1:11:38] The Works of the spirit which you
[1:11:40] manifests are these
[1:11:42] The Works of the soul is only faith in
[1:11:45] God's word
[1:11:47] see justification is just the outer
[1:11:49] courts
[1:11:50] sanctification is the Intercourse yes
[1:11:53] you almost there prevent
[1:11:55] potentially but down in there is where
[1:12:00] you and God meet
[1:12:03] and you and him alone
[1:12:05] he deals with Gentiles as individuals
[1:12:08] he deals with Israel as a nation
[1:12:11] when you meet in there
[1:12:13] in that place the most holy place you
[1:12:16] will never be the same yes you can go to
[1:12:19] church
[1:12:19] yes you can be an upstanding Christian
[1:12:21] but it's going to come a time that
[1:12:24] you'll be tested and find out where you
[1:12:25] stand
[1:12:27] and if you're standing on a solid rock
[1:12:29] which is Jesus
[1:12:30] glory to God you're standing on that
[1:12:32] Solid Rock
[1:12:34] talking to some guys at work
[1:12:36] and they look like they wanted to argue
[1:12:38] with one another take with him in here
[1:12:39] we all working together crew come help
[1:12:42] us from the maintenance because hey we
[1:12:43] all working together stop that
[1:12:45] foolishness right now big old fella told
[1:12:47] like that he looked around at me he said
[1:12:51] he's a what'd you say
[1:12:53] I said stop that foolishness with that
[1:12:54] guy let's get on get this work done it's
[1:12:56] 110 degrees out here and I'm watching
[1:12:59] y'all let's get this work done now
[1:13:03] I guess you the only preacher you're the
[1:13:05] only Christianity I said I'm the only
[1:13:07] Christian that's on fire must be I said
[1:13:09] because it's hot out here and you're all
[1:13:11] acting up and we got a job to do let's
[1:13:13] get it done now he's a preacher they
[1:13:15] told me you was a rough fella said I I
[1:13:18] said look at that man
[1:13:19] I used to be rough in the world
[1:13:21] I said God is good
[1:13:24] let's get this thing together and both
[1:13:27] of them look at me the little guy and
[1:13:28] the big guy and he said well we better
[1:13:30] go and get this done as y'all come over
[1:13:32] to help us
[1:13:33] camera this line let's get let's get
[1:13:35] work done
[1:13:37] and then he come and shake my hand and
[1:13:39] hit me on the back he said boy I tell
[1:13:41] you I said I would have been out here
[1:13:42] another hour with y'all with this
[1:13:44] foolishness I say love one another
[1:13:47] love one another no matter what they do
[1:13:50] they're spitting your face they slap you
[1:13:52] love them anyway because that is Jesus
[1:13:54] if Jesus wouldn't have loved them that
[1:13:57] did him at the cross he would have come
[1:13:58] down from the cross and all of us would
[1:14:00] be here in vain we'd be like Buddha and
[1:14:03] online Confucius and all them other gods
[1:14:05] Indian lady my neighborhood she like to
[1:14:07] talk to me
[1:14:08] and we start talking about Jesus and
[1:14:10] then she starts saying his son Jesus
[1:14:14] the moon Jesus and I said something my
[1:14:17] Minds you better get away from this lady
[1:14:18] here
[1:14:19] the cow Jesus
[1:14:21] they ground Jesus they Reign Jesus
[1:14:24] that's holy minute here now we're gonna
[1:14:25] live too far
[1:14:27] I said Jesus is his word
[1:14:30] and his life
[1:14:32] is the power of God into you
[1:14:35] and if that power resides into you
[1:14:38] the same power that's in that blood that
[1:14:41] shared 2 000 years ago that same blood
[1:14:43] has not lost any power
[1:14:45] it's got the power to save today as it
[1:14:49] did then when he was at Calvary and if
[1:14:51] he would have come off the cross
[1:14:53] you and I would be lost but he stood
[1:14:56] there and they whipped him and they beat
[1:14:58] him and they stabbed him in the side and
[1:14:59] the Bible said blood and water ruled out
[1:15:02] of me glory to God it was to sanctify
[1:15:05] the Old Testament Saints because they're
[1:15:07] about to be a resurrection
[1:15:09] and that second Ministry that second
[1:15:11] feeling of the Holy Ghost is to give you
[1:15:14] power to change from martial to
[1:15:16] immortality to get us out of here but
[1:15:19] you must get the fresh weed first before
[1:15:21] you can get the second wave he said If
[1:15:23] any man be in Christ
[1:15:25] he's a new creation old things that pass
[1:15:28] away behold All Things become new
[1:15:31] so now we're looking for the second
[1:15:33] anointing the unction of the holy ghost
[1:15:36] that comes upon the believer to Quicken
[1:15:40] him from Mortal to immortality so we can
[1:15:43] get out of here
[1:15:46] I know y'all don't want to stay here
[1:15:50] I know y'all don't want to stay here
[1:15:53] in the heart
[1:15:55] the soul lives in the heart
[1:15:57] and you believe from your heart
[1:16:00] people don't get religion in their head
[1:16:02] by book knowledge
[1:16:04] you get religion in Your Heart by an
[1:16:07] experience in your heart
[1:16:08] and the heart will always agree with the
[1:16:11] Bible
[1:16:12] but the head will reason
[1:16:14] and the Bible said that
[1:16:17] we cast down the reasoning
[1:16:20] we cast down all reasoning
[1:16:22] see now the hidden life
[1:16:24] is where you are eating
[1:16:27] it's where you are abiding
[1:16:29] I told the church a couple weeks ago I
[1:16:32] said
[1:16:32] this is what I want y'all to do
[1:16:35] I want y'all to read one or two chapters
[1:16:37] every day
[1:16:40] pray
[1:16:41] every day
[1:16:43] and I've seen the results already
[1:16:47] we get so busy
[1:16:49] that we can't read a chapter a day
[1:16:51] and you can't pray every day because a
[1:16:54] job uh this right here
[1:16:57] this little demon right here
[1:17:01] that's a little Spirit right there
[1:17:03] you use it for what you need to use it
[1:17:05] for and put it down
[1:17:07] if you pray as much as you got this in
[1:17:09] your hand
[1:17:11] this church will blow the roof or blow
[1:17:13] off you
[1:17:14] brother Simmons I had people coming all
[1:17:16] over
[1:17:17] out of the other states coming to get
[1:17:19] healed if we pray as much as we read
[1:17:21] this thing in look at this
[1:17:24] I clicked the Bible in the morning going
[1:17:27] to work and they want to give me five or
[1:17:29] ten ads for
[1:17:30] it cut on
[1:17:32] I said Lord have mercy distractions
[1:17:37] it's where you are abiding
[1:17:39] is where you are keeping yourself
[1:17:42] if you keeping yourself in the love of
[1:17:44] God and meditating on the word
[1:17:48] get quiet
[1:17:51] the hidden life Christ the hidden life
[1:17:53] in there says it's where you are abiding
[1:17:58] get quiet before God and watch God have
[1:18:02] a metamorphosis change in your life
[1:18:05] something will take place get away from
[1:18:08] the crying from the television from the
[1:18:10] noise and watch won't God begin to
[1:18:13] reveal to you the things that I help you
[1:18:15] to grow in Christ
[1:18:17] I said Lord I don't like to grow
[1:18:20] because every time you're growing you're
[1:18:21] going through something
[1:18:22] you don't grow why everything's going
[1:18:24] good you grow while you're suffering
[1:18:25] while you go through trials while you go
[1:18:27] through tests while you go through this
[1:18:29] thing that's what helps you to grow amen
[1:18:31] when somebody dislike you somebody hit
[1:18:34] you in the back somebody backstab you
[1:18:37] somebody talk about you you're growing
[1:18:39] and I tell the church if you get mad
[1:18:41] when somebody talk about you
[1:18:43] they even talk about dead people
[1:18:46] but dead people don't do what they can't
[1:18:48] talk back
[1:18:50] if you're dead in Christ you don't talk
[1:18:51] back you don't think about it no more
[1:18:53] people talk about dead people but if you
[1:18:56] if you grow
[1:18:58] and you love that person that talk about
[1:18:59] you God is going to take you to the next
[1:19:01] level
[1:19:02] when I was a little boy
[1:19:04] we had a commercial
[1:19:06] when his TV went off it said this is a
[1:19:08] test
[1:19:09] but American broadcast system
[1:19:11] this is only a test
[1:19:14] so you fighting the devil out there and
[1:19:15] this is only a test
[1:19:17] and you come to defeat him
[1:19:20] take David you might don't have a sword
[1:19:22] in your hand
[1:19:23] but your prayer life and your faith will
[1:19:24] take his sword and cut his head off
[1:19:28] get where God is
[1:19:30] abide where Christ is get in that secret
[1:19:33] place and watch the Power of Brad
[1:19:36] Tabernacle and Faith Tabernacle begin to
[1:19:39] explode because guess what the darker it
[1:19:42] get it means what
[1:19:43] if the Devils get the world is getting
[1:19:45] darker that means we got to shine
[1:19:47] brighter
[1:19:49] John 15 and 26.
[1:19:53] but when the Comfort has come
[1:19:56] who I will send unto you from the father
[1:19:58] even the spirit of Truth which
[1:20:01] proceedeth from the father he shall
[1:20:04] testify of me
[1:20:06] and ye also shall bear Witness
[1:20:10] because ye have been with me from the
[1:20:14] beginning
[1:20:15] see if you've been with Jesus from the
[1:20:17] beginning you're going to Bear witness
[1:20:18] of the Resurrection
[1:20:21] see that's why we can commune with him
[1:20:23] because we've been with him from the
[1:20:24] beginning so now a thought
[1:20:27] a germ an expression God's thought so if
[1:20:30] God thought about you you in his eternal
[1:20:32] thoughts God don't have a thought that's
[1:20:34] not Eternal he's a Judas we're not with
[1:20:36] him
[1:20:37] but you were with him in the Lamb's Book
[1:20:39] of Life
[1:20:40] and God is going to send trouble with
[1:20:42] your weight until he gets you into the
[1:20:44] place that a metamorphosis did taking
[1:20:47] place in your life trouble gonna
[1:20:49] continue to come until you obey God's
[1:20:52] word and God can help you to grow
[1:20:55] church we in adoption season
[1:20:57] with winnowing time
[1:20:59] his wintering time is not a highly a
[1:21:01] Christian out there you put you in
[1:21:03] adoption season
[1:21:05] Hebrews 8.
[1:21:07] and I'm gonna close
[1:21:12] Hebrews 8.
[1:21:20] Hebrews 8 and 1.
[1:21:25] and I might have to go to seven
[1:21:27] it is now of the things which we have
[1:21:31] spoken this is the Sun
[1:21:33] we have such and high priest
[1:21:36] who is set at the right hand of God
[1:21:39] the right hand of the Throne of the
[1:21:40] Majesty in the heavens a minister of the
[1:21:43] sanctuary
[1:21:45] and of the true Tabernacle
[1:21:49] which the Lord pitched and not man
[1:21:52] what's that true Tabernacle it's you and
[1:21:54] I we are the two Tabernacles of God it
[1:21:57] wasn't faith it wasn't virtue it wasn't
[1:22:00] Temperance it's the seventh Tabernacle
[1:22:03] was the Bible said it cannot even be
[1:22:06] complete without us this is the true
[1:22:08] Tabernacle
[1:22:10] you and I in laosia what happened
[1:22:13] Satan came in God In the Garden of Eden
[1:22:17] and
[1:22:20] trick God's bride
[1:22:22] now God has got his bride in Satan Eden
[1:22:25] which is laodicea
[1:22:27] you are the true Tabernacle
[1:22:30] which the Lord pitching not man
[1:22:32] Forever high priestess is ordained to
[1:22:34] offer gifts and sacrifices whereof it is
[1:22:37] a necessity that this man has somewhat
[1:22:39] also to offer for if he were on Earth he
[1:22:43] should not be a priest seeing that there
[1:22:46] are priests that offer gifts according
[1:22:48] to the law
[1:22:51] saith unto the example and Shadow of
[1:22:54] heavenly things and Moses was admonished
[1:22:57] of God when he was about to make the
[1:22:59] Tabernacle for sin saith he that thou
[1:23:03] maketh all things according to the
[1:23:04] pattern showed thee in the mouth but now
[1:23:08] have he obtained a more excellent
[1:23:10] Ministry by how much more also he is a
[1:23:13] mediator of a better Covenant which was
[1:23:16] established upon better promises
[1:23:19] for if that first Covenant was faultless
[1:23:21] then should no place have been sought
[1:23:23] for the second for finding fault with
[1:23:25] them he said behold the Deeds come saith
[1:23:28] the Lord I will make a New Covenant with
[1:23:31] the house of Israel and with the house
[1:23:33] of Judah
[1:23:34] not according to the Covenant that I
[1:23:36] made with the fathers and the date and I
[1:23:38] took them out of the land of Egypt
[1:23:40] because he continued not in my Covenant
[1:23:43] and I regarded him not said the law see
[1:23:45] the priesthood in the Old Testament was
[1:23:48] made a certain way offer but God said
[1:23:50] I'm going to make a new thing this
[1:23:52] priesthood that he came under not that
[1:23:54] Catholic priesthood because he had for
[1:23:55] no father mother but this priesthood was
[1:23:58] going to be a priesthood of worship
[1:24:02] worship is going to take you from
[1:24:04] salvation from a sinner to Salvation
[1:24:06] worship gonna take you from sin from
[1:24:09] justification and sanctification from
[1:24:11] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:24:12] Holy Ghost it's going to take you into
[1:24:13] the Holy Ghost Holiness of Holiness
[1:24:15] Jesus was showing that this bride is
[1:24:18] going to be true Tabernacle by wish
[1:24:24] when you offer a sacrifice unto God
[1:24:27] reading or praying you're going to
[1:24:30] completely yield yourself to the power
[1:24:33] and presence of Jesus that is what the
[1:24:37] bride does she yields herself to the
[1:24:40] house
[1:24:42] the husband know what the wife know what
[1:24:46] the husband wants done with the word
[1:24:49] Jesus know that you know what he wants
[1:24:52] done with it
[1:24:53] that's why the Bible said we have such a
[1:24:55] great high priest which is passing to
[1:24:57] the heavens Jesus the son of God let us
[1:25:00] not glory to God let us not falter let
[1:25:03] us not be weary but let us go into the
[1:25:06] wholeness of Holiness by the blood of
[1:25:08] Jesus Hebrews 10 and 19.
[1:25:11] we're going into the holy place by the
[1:25:14] blood of Jesus it's not nothing we've
[1:25:16] done but what Jesus has done for us we
[1:25:19] can't glory in nothing but in the cross
[1:25:22] of Calvin
[1:25:25] now look what he says
[1:25:28] for this Covenant that I make with the
[1:25:30] house of Israel said the Lord I put my
[1:25:33] laws into their minds and write them in
[1:25:35] their hearts and I will be to them and
[1:25:36] God and they shall be to me and people
[1:25:38] and they shall not teach every man his
[1:25:40] neighbor every man is brother saying
[1:25:42] know the Lord For All Shall know me from
[1:25:44] the least to the greatest and I will be
[1:25:46] merciful unto their unrighteousness and
[1:25:49] their sins and iniquities will I
[1:25:51] remember
[1:25:52] no more
[1:25:54] so don't worry about somebody
[1:25:55] remembering your sins
[1:25:56] Jesus remember no more
[1:25:59] you pass through
[1:26:01] Paul said let me go from glory to glory
[1:26:03] even by the spirit of Christ
[1:26:09] and
[1:26:10] for I will be merciful to their
[1:26:12] righteous unrighteousness and their sins
[1:26:15] and iniquities will I remember no more
[1:26:16] in that saith he a New Covenant I've
[1:26:19] made the first old
[1:26:21] now that which the chaith and wax his
[1:26:22] old is ready to vanish away
[1:26:25] 7 and 22 I'm closing
[1:26:28] by so much was Jesus made a surety of a
[1:26:32] better Testament
[1:26:35] see Melchizedek
[1:26:37] had no father no mother
[1:26:39] he met Abraham returning
[1:26:42] from the slaughter the Kings
[1:26:44] and he blessed him
[1:26:46] and he gave a tenth of all the spoil
[1:26:48] that he had
[1:26:49] thank the Lord for Melchizedek Ministry
[1:26:52] but Melchizedek Ministry couldn't save
[1:26:54] us
[1:26:56] they had to come another high priest
[1:26:58] and his name is Jesus
[1:27:00] and he passed through the heavens
[1:27:02] Jesus the son of God that's why the
[1:27:05] Bible said lay all your sins and
[1:27:07] iniquities upon him
[1:27:09] when Jesus died the Bible said he
[1:27:11] bypassed sex desire
[1:27:13] he wasn't born like we was born because
[1:27:16] Job 14 said man that's born of a woman
[1:27:18] deserve a few days and full of trouble
[1:27:20] even though the woman the man came by
[1:27:22] the woman woman has to come back by the
[1:27:24] man
[1:27:25] and if you're born of God you're born by
[1:27:28] the man Christ Jesus but if you're born
[1:27:30] of the devil and you stay there you're
[1:27:31] born by a woman now but anyone that's
[1:27:33] born of a man is born again anyone
[1:27:36] that's born of a woman is going to hell
[1:27:37] his glory to God the man was by the
[1:27:40] woman not a Woman by the man now glory
[1:27:42] to God if you understand what I'm saying
[1:27:44] if the man Christ Jesus had birthed you
[1:27:46] your birth into the body as First
[1:27:48] Corinthians 13 says in John 3 he told
[1:27:51] Nicodemus you must be born again not of
[1:27:54] just water not of just Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:56] but you must be born by the spirit and
[1:27:59] if your birth of the spirit now you are
[1:28:01] baptized into the body of Christ in in
[1:28:04] the body of Christ there's nothing but
[1:28:06] the word in there
[1:28:07] now look what it says and they truly
[1:28:10] were many priests because they were not
[1:28:12] suffered to continue by reason of death
[1:28:15] so those priests couldn't continue
[1:28:17] but you have an everlasting priesthood
[1:28:20] but this man
[1:28:22] this was no ordinary man
[1:28:25] is what no ordinary man
[1:28:28] he's a Rose of Sharon he's a lily of the
[1:28:31] veil he's a Bright Morning Star but this
[1:28:33] man
[1:28:34] Oh Glory to God if I can exalt this man
[1:28:37] if I can get weak like John the Baptist
[1:28:40] this man John said I must decrease and
[1:28:42] he must increase I think the ministry
[1:28:45] right now should be in decreasing and as
[1:28:48] we decrease about what we've done and
[1:28:49] who we are I think he'll increase John
[1:28:52] said let me decrease and let him
[1:28:54] increase John said the bride groom has
[1:28:57] the bride first John 20 Saint John 1 and
[1:29:00] 29 the bride groom has the bride John
[1:29:03] was sending them to go with him and they
[1:29:05] locked John in prison and John began to
[1:29:08] look and his ego I was dimming over and
[1:29:11] the disciples came to him and said John
[1:29:13] John told him said ask him if this is
[1:29:16] him or shall we look for another and
[1:29:18] Jesus told John's disciples you follow
[1:29:21] me just a little while you see the death
[1:29:23] the death he or the leper's cleanser the
[1:29:26] blind eyes are open and they went back
[1:29:28] and told John what they saw and what he
[1:29:30] done Jesus said if you believe me for
[1:29:33] the very work sake I don't believe that
[1:29:35] I'm marrying Joseph's son I'm the Son of
[1:29:37] God made flesh that your sins might be
[1:29:41] eradicated in my blood
[1:29:44] but this man because he continued ever
[1:29:47] having an unchangeable priesthood
[1:29:50] see the Old Testament has a priesthood
[1:29:51] that was changing
[1:29:53] the priest went in in the Old Testament
[1:29:56] had a chain on him
[1:29:58] and a bell made a sound holy to the Lord
[1:30:01] and if he didn't approach God right
[1:30:04] they drug him out under the curtain did
[1:30:08] and sometimes we come into church every
[1:30:11] Sunday
[1:30:12] with problems
[1:30:13] instead of knowing that Jesus can heal
[1:30:15] us
[1:30:16] every Sunday from in and out we come
[1:30:18] with problems and don't know all we got
[1:30:21] to say
[1:30:22] As Romans 10 and 9 said if Thou shalt
[1:30:24] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:30:25] and believe in thou art that God has
[1:30:26] raising from the dead thou shall be
[1:30:27] saved with the heart with the heart man
[1:30:30] believe it with the mouth confessions
[1:30:31] made unto salvation
[1:30:33] so once you confess to Jesus
[1:30:36] and you believe it in your heart that he
[1:30:38] can do it it's done
[1:30:40] just read the scriptures about the Fig
[1:30:42] Tree Peter said the Fig Tree we just
[1:30:44] passed it Lord are we coming back by and
[1:30:46] it's withered away he said if you
[1:30:48] believe
[1:30:49] Mark 11 and 22 said
[1:30:51] if you believe you see all things
[1:30:54] but you got to believe you got to trust
[1:30:56] and believe and the only thing can bring
[1:30:58] that type of faith in believing is the
[1:31:01] Holy Ghost you've got to get Beyond the
[1:31:03] Veil when life begins that's what brings
[1:31:06] the faith of the Holy Ghost back there
[1:31:09] if you got a sickness get back down it's
[1:31:11] gone
[1:31:12] just like that
[1:31:14] just like that it's gone
[1:31:16] look what he says
[1:31:17] unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is
[1:31:20] able to save them under the utter moves
[1:31:22] that come unto God by him seeing he ever
[1:31:25] liveth to make intercession for them for
[1:31:27] such and high priests became who
[1:31:30] you and I
[1:31:31] for such and high priest became us
[1:31:35] and if you're a priest
[1:31:37] that means you in service
[1:31:40] not a woman preaching now
[1:31:42] you in service
[1:31:44] to offer spiritual sacrifices unto God
[1:31:48] which is your reasonable service see
[1:31:52] Jesus saying it's your reasonable story
[1:31:53] but if you don't want to do it you don't
[1:31:54] have to do it but it's your reasonable
[1:31:56] service and be not conformed to this
[1:31:58] world but be you transformed by the
[1:32:00] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:32:03] what is the good and acceptable and
[1:32:05] perfect will of God
[1:32:08] session for such and high priest became
[1:32:10] us who is wholly harmless undefiled
[1:32:12] separate from Sinners and made higher
[1:32:14] than the heavens
[1:32:16] who needeth not daily as those High
[1:32:18] priests to offer up sacrifices for first
[1:32:22] his own sins and then for the peoples
[1:32:24] for this he did once when he offered up
[1:32:27] himself
[1:32:29] so if he did one sacrifice to save us
[1:32:32] you only need one sacrifice to be saved
[1:32:38] for the lawmaker of men High priests
[1:32:40] which have infirmities but the word of
[1:32:43] old which is was since the law make of
[1:32:45] the son who is consecrated forevermore
[1:32:50] that's our preached this morning
[1:32:53] I'ma stay with what I say I'm closing
[1:32:56] I got 20 more scriptures
[1:32:59] but such an high priest became us
[1:33:02] identified Christ of all ages
[1:33:05] and when you identified with Christ
[1:33:08] there's something take place in you
[1:33:11] a metamorphosis take place
[1:33:14] in you death takes place in you and
[1:33:18] Christ is Resurrected
[1:33:20] and when he's resurrected all power in
[1:33:23] Heaven and Earth Jesus said in Matthew
[1:33:24] 20 and 19 is given unto me
[1:33:27] in him was the fullness of God first
[1:33:30] Colossians 1 and 26 in him dwelleth all
[1:33:34] the fullness of the godhead body
[1:33:37] so you are complete in him which is the
[1:33:41] head of all principalities all powers
[1:33:44] all things
[1:33:46] in him
[1:33:48] so when you eat him you above all
[1:33:50] principalities you're above sickness
[1:33:52] you're above trouble you're above trials
[1:33:54] but you got to be in him
[1:33:57] in him
[1:33:58] but first it must be Romans 10 and 9.
[1:34:01] you must confess
[1:34:02] and not only confession you must believe
[1:34:04] what you say
[1:34:06] and it shouldn't be your belief it
[1:34:08] should be God and but it's where you are
[1:34:11] keeping yourself
[1:34:12] if you're keeping yourself in the most
[1:34:14] holy place all things are possible to
[1:34:17] them that believe
[1:34:18] God bless you
[1:34:24] let us bow
[1:34:27] if you want prayer you can come
[1:34:29] as the brother sane to brother Gordon
[1:34:32] sings
[1:34:33] if you want prayer you can come
[1:34:37] if you say Lord
[1:34:38] I don't know where I'm placed at in the
[1:34:40] Tabernacle
[1:34:42] but I want to be in the most holy place
[1:34:46] you can lift your hands where you stand
[1:34:50] and we'll pray with you or if you want
[1:34:52] to come up we'll pray with you
[1:34:54] the Lord I I've been going up and down
[1:34:57] and in and out
[1:34:58] and I'm not consistently reading my
[1:35:00] Bible every day
[1:35:02] I'm not consistently praying every day
[1:35:03] but I want to get closer to you
[1:35:07] you can come or lift your hands
[1:35:11] Lord I know that this world is coming to
[1:35:13] a close
[1:35:15] they won't let you preach after a while
[1:35:19] unless you see the mark in your hand or
[1:35:21] your forehead
[1:35:25] Lord let us make a fool
[1:35:28] advantage
[1:35:30] of our opportunity
[1:35:32] in Christ
[1:35:36] Lord
[1:35:37] the ministry preaching sweating
[1:35:40] tears praying and crying
[1:35:44] that Souls would come to the kingdom
[1:35:47] people would continue to grow in Christ
[1:35:51] Lord help your people this morning
[1:35:54] what bothered us last year shouldn't be
[1:35:57] bothering us this year
[1:35:59] the things we went through last year we
[1:36:01] shouldn't go through this year
[1:36:03] God is going to keep the tests
[1:36:06] upon you until you overcome it
[1:36:10] said Lord help me to overcome
[1:36:12] by the blood of Jesus
[1:36:15] by New and Living Way which is
[1:36:17] consecrated
[1:36:18] for us through the Veil
[1:36:21] Lord help the little church in Camden

[1:36:32] are needed
[1:36:33] for salvation
[1:36:37] help us to do and say the things that
[1:36:39] drive us
[1:36:40] to the Holy Ghost
[1:36:43] the very presence in life of Jesus
[1:36:45] Christ in US
[1:36:47] not a denomination
[1:36:50] but your word
[1:36:52] Jesus is the truth this morning
[1:36:56] you can accept him or reject him
[1:36:59] but I believe you will receive accept
[1:37:01] him this morning

[1:37:22] and it's going to take more Mercy Lord
[1:37:25] put our lives to get us where we need to
[1:37:26] be
