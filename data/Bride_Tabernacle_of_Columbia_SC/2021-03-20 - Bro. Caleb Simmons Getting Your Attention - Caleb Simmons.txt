speak to every need speak to every heart tonight lord jesus bless your word lord let us move out of the way that you may get all the glory the honor and the praise in jesus name we pray amen let us turn to look at exodus chapter 3. you gotta say man amen and it reads now moses he kept the flock of jephro his father-in-law the pre the priest of midian and he and he led the flock uh to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great thing why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i amen god had a blessing to the remnants of where it may be seated amen we'd like to speak on a little topic tonight of getting your attention amen in the scripture here in the book of exodus moses this is after the time and he had left run away from egypt left the king's palace and he got to the point in time he's on the back side of the desert heard and sheep all the time moses knew that he was a chosen vessel and that that the lord had called him to something special something great and he decided that one day he wanted to take it into his own hands and not and not follow god's plan so he got to the point he killed an egyptian so he had to run for his life he got on the back side of the desert and god said one day after after he had been through some trials and some tests in the desert he said i got to get his attention so he sent the burning bush but he didn't let it be consumed because he knew that's what he needed to get moses attention and moses turned aside and he said after the lord recognized that he he saw what was going on he said moses moses and moses answered here am i because he recognized that god was getting his attention all throughout the bible there are scriptures and stories about how god used different things to get people's attention and each person was different moses god knew that he needed to fight to show him that to get his attention let's turn to the um the book of first kings chapter 19. we'll start at the first nine at this time elijah he has jezebel is after elijah and it says in verse 9 he said he came he came through there into a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto elijah what dost thou hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down on altars and slain thy prophets with the work with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by in a great and strong wind rent the mountain and break it in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after a fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what dost thou hear elijah now these are two different stories in the bible where god gets his servant's attention and the first one he used to use the burning bush and this one he used a small steel voice and in this one he test elijah he wanted to see if elijah was listening first he sent the wind then he sent the earthquake and then he said he sent the fire but god wasn't in those he was in a little small still voice and sometimes god does that even in our own lives to see whether we're paying attention and we ask the question some people ask the question how do you know it's the voice of god the answer to that question is that the message that you receive will be in line with the word of god you can always take it back to the word to fact check it as i say you can look back because the bible is your fact book it's your checkbook it's your guideline it's the thing that you can look back at and say let's just line up with the word of god the bible says try the spirit by the spirit amen amen so in here he uses he uses different things to grab their attention even in our own personal lives sometimes i tell people don't discredit the message because of the messenger so some of the best advice i got in my life one time came from a man that looked homeless he might not have been he could have been but he sent me a message that was a word that i knew was nothing but from god because he spoke into my life and he said he told me i was going through some things that he couldn't have known because i've never met him i've never seen him he wouldn't know what i was doing or what i was going through and he spoke a message and it was to get my attention now if i would have looked at him i never would have received or maybe even come to him to respond to him in the correct way because i'm looking on what i see not on what not on what he what the lord is trying to speak to me in this moment in this situation in this time god just recently took me through something and he used a child to send me a word he and i was looking at it and i was like now most people would have thought oh that's just a story or would have just passed it along but if you're listening to what god is trying to speak to you sometimes a children can speak a child can speak in the bible he is you have the yeah balaam in the donkey he used the donkey to speak to him it wasn't nothing great he used the animal and the prophet of god tells a story but in his life how opossum came to his house and he didn't know that god was trying the possum laid there for 24 hours sick and lame and he's god was trying to show that and show show others that it doesn't take something great it doesn't take like everybody doesn't have a paul experience on the road to damascus well lights shine from heaven everybody doesn't have what a donkey speaks to him but everyone god speaks to you in some way and he knows exactly how to get your attention he knows what it takes he knows how far to go and he always he said in his word he never put more on you than you could bear he always makes sure that in your time and in your season there's a word for you there's something there if you're going through trials and tribulation there's something a word of deliverance will come but you got to be expecting it you also got to be ready for each situation here god knew that moses was ready he had been through some trials he had been through some tests he had been through some tribulations but now he was ready he was prepared for the word that god was going to send him elijah he had run from jezebel he thought he was the only one lord i'm the only one left jesus but god showed him he had to speak to him and say no it's not you i got over 7 000 that's still here serving me even in this time where we just stealing the pandemic and going through different things where they say the best way to defeat to to defeat an enemy is to the bottom is to separate them but if you're listening to what god is trying to say to you you'll never be off the word because god will just tell you what the word says he'll just send a message that it'll back it up with the scripture with the word so you can be in line and just if you have questions then you go back to the word and say lord i need you to show me because not everything is revealed to you straight off moses didn't know the plan that god had for his life he didn't know that god was gonna he was gonna have to sin run for his life go to the desert and then god was gonna bring him back as an old man to save god's people he thought while i'm young and strong i'd do this myself but he had to go through some things and go through some trials in life to end up to where he was able to save the children the children of israel god just used different things in life to get your attention if you were his child he said i've never lost one he never lose he'll never lose one so he'll always send things and you'll say lord why am i going through this lord why am i going through that and recently i had someone reach out to me and they said man why why do you think i you people go through certain things i said god sometimes takes you takes you through things to see what will your response be and sometimes he'll take you back through a similar situation to see have you learned your lesson yet he'll take you back around and say i guess you didn't have the right response yet he said brother branham spoke i suppose um told the story about sister hattie wright and he asked her what did you want what would you want and she said lord i want the salvation of my two sons he said that's the right answer he takes you through certain things to to see what your response will be because sometimes you think i made it over i've crossed over i shouldn't be dealing with this no more but then he'll bring it back and say let me see have you really overcome have you really gotten through and actually broke through or you just made it to the door and thought that you had made it and he uses different things to get your attention sometimes he says son daughter is trying to get closer to you let me let me do something to just you everything going well but let me do something to disturb it so that you can get closer to me he uses different things to get your attention as is many examples all throughout the bible where he just points out and he shows us that where he just even the story of david and bathsheba in the book of second samuel chapter 12 he goes there and he says for this one to get david's attention he sent a prophet he sent nathan to tell him a story about the lamb the rich man who takes the poor man's he has plenty of sheep and everything and then he goes and he takes the lame man he takes his lamb the only thing that he has a and david gets upset and said say that man ought to be he needs to be punished and nathan turns around and says you are that man and david said he he is immediately sorrowful but it goes to point the bible says that david was a man after god's own heart and he still made mistakes he and he still was human even though he was a man after god's own heart god still had to use something he had to use his his servant to get his attention so we all but it's it's are you willing to recognize that god is speaking to you are you willing to recognize that first they said the only way to solve a problem first you got to admit that you have a problem you'll never solve a problem that you that you don't admit that that is there and so god uses different things to get your attention to send you a word in due season to tell you different things to speak to you he sends people he sends situations he sends circumstances in life that just point to you to show that sometimes you just need to get closer to him you just need to sometimes it's the message that you need to pray more you need to read your bible more i was listening to the prophet of god he said you can tell you can tell certain things about people by the things that they read and it he said i when i go to a house you can tell by the books that they have sitting on their bookshelf the different things about them he said i want to go by the person that has that has that bible right next to him that has the word of god that's you can tell that it's been read it's been worn pages are worn and it was just things that god was pointing out to me that sometimes he you he's using different things people in different situations to get my attention to speak to me to say this is time that we we all need to get closer to him because we because you never know what's coming what's on the path god is preparing you for a reason not just oh well i can wait why or i'm gonna have another chance because we don't know what if another pandemic hits and we not able to come together take advantage of the things that that god has given us in this space and time because you never know when you when the time is when your time is coming when things are coming that that time period the thing that god was trying to get your attention to prepare you for our opinion and you miss the opportunity god because before judgment god said he always sends a warning and he uses many things to get your attention whether it be people whether it be things where whatever it may be but you have to be ready and listen watching for the things that god says amen appreciate the word tonight getting your attention amen you know god is so good just sitting there thinking you know as he was ministering tonight you know he was saying some things that i was telling my wife before we came to service tonight i said you know uh like he was saying uh we can miss a lot of times what god is saying to us because of the messenger and i said a lot of times we do miss god we miss god all the time because god you know i was thinking i was telling my wife i says you know i was on my knees yesterday praying and i said lord you know because god can start showering you with blessings start doing all kinds of things in your life and spiritual things as well i was telling my wife some things i i said they'd be working with you all the time and i said but i was on my knees and i was praying i said lord i said no matter what happens in this life no matter what where i find myself no matter where you take me i said lord don't let me change but let me stay on my knees you know let me stay into the place to where i'm always depending on your grace i said no matter what happens because i was telling my wife i said you know a lot of people got destroyed because no doubt you know things started happening with them god maybe started blessing them but they were lifted up to their own destruction i says but you know one place i said lord no matter what happens i just want i want to stay to in a certain place of of all my needs and humility and reverence for god always understanding one thing that without him we ain't nothing you know that scripture came to my mind that i think it was psalm 8 he says when i consider the heavens and the work of thy hands what is a man that thou art mindful of him i said when we look around to what we got or what we can brag about i said consider the heavens and the work of god's hands and i said what is a man what are you capable of but nevertheless i says god is sovereign you know i was trying saying to myself i said lord you sovereign all by yourself you don't need no help when god want to bless you or god want to do things he don't need nobody's help he don't have to sit we get with counsel with nobody when god want to do something he can do it without no help come on i said god you sovereign i said we lo we we serve a sovereign god we serve a god that when he want to bless you can't nobody stop it you know i think about joseph and how you know god wanted to bless joseph nobody couldn't stop him put him in a pit put him here put him in jail come on but nevertheless god was gonna make room for him and i thank god i said all the time where are we at in life where are we we're god making room for us in the midst of the pandemic a lot of people lost their jobs a lot of people sick a lot of people lost a lot of things but god made room for us and i thank god for making room for us come on i thank god don't you thank god for making a way for you for opening doors for you doing things for you that you say lord i'm not even worthy of your blessings i'm not even worthy lord of what you or what you what you've given me and what you're doing in my life i ain't worthy of it lord i believe like jacob said lord i ain't worthy of the least of your mercies but nevertheless god is still pouring out his grace and his blessing i said lord don't let me change but let me stay on my knees let me stay worshiping you let me stay giving you glory stay given you praise god why because i'm here to do one thing and that's to worship you hallelujah you know i was ministering on sunday about what faith does and i was saying you know the lord made a statement he says and in the scriptures the bible says that when i return shall i find faith will he find faith when he returned because he knew that that would be the one thing that the people would lose he didn't say what i find big churches or or what i find faithful members and all that he says but when i find will i find faith when i return because you know i said as i was sharing with the church on sunday i said the thing is i says when a person is faithful going to church or faithful panic tithes or faithful in that aspect we say oh they're a believer but that's not what jesus said a believer was that that's the the misconception of what a believer is because they wear long dresses that's not a believer but he said that these signs shall follow them that believe he said in my name they'll cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll take up serpents they'll do these things he said these signs shall follow them that believe i said that's a believer not just being an outward member like that i said but come on these signs are following the believers so i asked the question even sunday i said so are you a believer come on do you believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever do you believe the holy ghost is still real you believe god is still healing and delivering all this thing as time go on what happens what's happening as time go on people losing their faith people losing their their because they their concept of god was all messed up and so they losing that as time go on as time go on people like to say losing their religion all these things but what it is that just the more impossible it seemed that's the more that we starting to see god to do what he promised that he'll do come on how many believe that tonight i says you know you know god getting your attention thank the lord i said you know because what it is like a lot of times like i said we miss god we may god god do a lot of things but we miss it he speak to a lot of people but we miss it like brother caleb was saying tonight he's speaking through children he do it all the time and we miss it he speak to a homeless man and we miss it come on god uh veil coming back to to do something for us and and if we could only if we can only receive no matter where it comes from if we can only receive a word don't you don't you know how powerful a word from god is he said i sent my word and it's going to do what it accomplished he says i sent my i sent my word and it healed him come on you know how much power is in a word from god no matter who it came from if it's a word from god to receive that word it has the power to transform it has the power to create it has the power to heal it's going to accomplish the whatever god sent it to do no matter where it comes from if it's a word from the lord it's power in that word come on but if we allow the word just to sit dormant and don't take it come on and don't uh like mary pondered all these things in your heart then it won't do nothing for you come on it'll sit there you know you say a lot of people they believed and they didn't get healed they died come on that did not take away from god's word that did not take away god came to do a job he says uh the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel come on to the poor to heal the sick the broken heart and all he said they kept it free god he came to do a purpose and he didn't leave without accomplishing what he came to do it's still real no matter how many critics around it no matter how many people saying it ain't real it's still real come on god is still doing the same things he's been doing and we're still looking and depending on him as time goes on for him to still be real how many depending on him tonight i says but what it is a lot of times he's challenging your faith it's what he's doing you know i was thinking i said uh in in saint john 5 how the bible says that when the water was a certain season the water got troubled an angel would come down they believed that those people didn't have scripture on it but they believed that when the water was troubled you say why the water had to be troubled you think about you know the water you're rushing or whatever just trouble water look like if you sick or an ailment you wouldn't get in trouble water you wouldn't get in water like that but when you got faith come on when you when or when let's say when you desperate you'll do whatever to get your healing you know when you desperate like uh brother caleb was saying tonight god put us in places sometimes you know that like he did moses he put us in places sometime to get our attention or he backs us in a corner to where we have no other uh hope or salvation but him come on so i said that when that water was troubled no matter what ailment there was they was trying to get in because they believe that if i can just get in that water and i'm worried about whether i'm a swim drown all that but if i can get in that water come on my faith telling me that god is going to do something supernatural if i can get in that water come on and i says what it is your faith god you got it's something in you that you got to know that when you when you believe god you got to know that when you take hold to the word you got to know that when all that fails you holding on to the word it's your faith got to tell you that god he's still god he's going he going to handle the situation how many believe that tonight i said god will handle it for you if you only if you're only allowed that's that's my my uh challenge tonight is allow allow god to move in your life step back and let god be god step back and say god you i'ma let you come on i'm just here to worship you lord i'm i'm just gonna worship you i'm just gonna lift my hands you mind lifting your hands tonight say lord thank you lord i thank you thank you for your grace lord and thank you for your mercy you said you're trying to work something up come on but ain't nobody trying to work nothing up come on it's something about god he comes down and he dwells in that when you worship the lord when you tell the lord thank you come on blessings will be outpoured you'll shower out his blessing his spirit come on somebody need their joy god to give them their joy back somebody need their peace god to give them their peace back if you learn how to worship god lord i'm stepping out in the troubled waters god i'm letting go of myself i'm letting go of all things lord i'm here to worship you lord thank you jesus thank you for your grace lord thank you for your mercy lord i'm a walk on the water lord i'm gonna walk into my healing i'm gonna walk into my deliverance i'm gonna walk god into the grace of god lord thank you the fire is all around me but yet lord i'm walking in peace hallelujah walking in my deliverance hallelujah the violent take it by force you need what you need from god take it hallelujah he said they give it all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah god i believe lord and i'm taking it by force i'm walking tonight with the lord how many want to walk hallelujah don't you just love the presence of god don't you love the holy ghost hallelujah when he comes down and he begins to feel and touching it somebody that just came in and they weren't feeling it but now they're feeling it and something that got hold to him hallelujah stirs you up it makes you on fire again hallelujah somebody said did you get it yet come on oh jesus i'm walking in it why because god promised it to me did you get it yet i'm walking in it because god promised it to me did you receive it yet thank the lord like the man said for healing me thank the lord for opening my eyes thank you hallelujah he walked into what he confessed and all of a sudden one day hallelujah he was a walking testimony to what he confessed hallelujah i don't know about you but i'm walking in it hallelujah i'm walking in miracles that song says i know who i am hallelujah come on i'm walking in miracles i'm walking in these things why because god declared that these signs shall follow them that believe hallelujah and as god take you on that ride and like i said stay humble hallelujah is god take you on that ride of grace you just walk in and hallelujah you just thank god because god taken you somewhere hallelujah hallelujah to a higher plane as i was sharing with the congregation of the sun that said fly eagles fly come on i said when that eagle learned how to fly come on he starts soaring soaring high those wings were there all the time but he had to learn how to use them [Music] hallelujah praise the lord amen god is good amen you get to our attention in many ways amen so glad that he got my attention praise god it's been a long long time ago he got my attention praise god and you you must meet god amen for yourself and once you meet god you'll never be the same amen nobody that met god came out and they were the same amen your life changes when you meet god so he got you when he gets your attention not just coming to church not just shout not just dancing but when god really gets your attention except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of god he cannot see it it takes the holy ghost to open your understanding to the kingdom of god there are some things that i was writing down today as i was praying and um and i was listening to the prophet today and he was saying some things and scripture tells us it reigns on the just and unjust reigns on the jets and unjust so the spirit of god when it comes down he said i'm gonna give those people that's believers i'm gonna let the rain fall in the church but it's only gonna fall on the believers but the rain falls on the just and the unjust when the rain falls on your naval garden you'll fall on and he'll fall on the wicket as well as god didn't sit in rain he said i'm just going to shower my reign on the good on the righteous but i'm gonna just end the unjust so many people that the anointing of god would be on their life but down in their soul they got to be seen sometimes people can have the anointing and have gifts and have gifts of healing
