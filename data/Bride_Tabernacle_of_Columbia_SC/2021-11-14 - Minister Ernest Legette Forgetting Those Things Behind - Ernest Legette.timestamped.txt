[30:53] we'll begin
[30:55] at the
[30:59] beginning first first you got to say
[31:01] amen
[31:02] and it reads finally brother and rejoice
[31:05] in the lord
[31:07] rejoice in the lord to write the same
[31:09] things to you
[31:10] to me
[31:11] and
[31:12] to you to me indeed is not grievous but
[31:16] for you it is safe beware of dogs beware
[31:19] of evil workers beware of the con
[31:23] concision
[31:25] concision
[31:26] for we are the circumcision
[31:28] which worship god in spirit and rejoice
[31:31] in christ jesus and have no confidence
[31:34] in the flesh
[31:35] though i might also have confidence in
[31:37] the flesh if there if any other man
[31:40] thinketh that he
[31:41] have whereof he might trust in the flesh
[31:44] more circumcised the eighth day
[31:47] of the stock of israel
[31:49] of the tribe of benjamin
[31:51] a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the
[31:54] law of pharisee concerning zeal
[31:57] persecuting the church
[31:59] touching the righteousness
[32:00] which is in the law blameless
[32:03] but what things were gained to me
[32:06] those i counted lost
[32:08] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[32:12] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[32:14] of christ jesus my lord for whom i have
[32:17] suffered the loss of all things and do
[32:20] count them but done
[32:22] that i may win christ and be found in
[32:25] him not having mine own righteousness
[32:27] which is of the law
[32:29] but that which is through the faith of
[32:31] christ the righteousness which is of god
[32:34] by faith that i might know him and the
[32:37] power of his resurrection and the
[32:39] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[32:42] conformable unto his death if by any
[32:45] means i may obtain unto the resurrection
[32:48] of the dead not as though i have already
[32:50] attained either were already perfect but
[32:53] i follow out the
[32:55] follow after if that i may apprehend
[32:58] that for which also i have apprehended
[33:00] of christ jesus brethren i count not
[33:03] myself to have apprehended but this one
[33:06] thing i do
[33:07] forgetting those things which are behind
[33:11] and reaching forth until the things
[33:13] which are before are pressed toward the
[33:15] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[33:18] god in christ jesus let us therefore as
[33:21] many be perfect be thus minded and if
[33:24] any
[33:24] and if anything you be otherwise minded
[33:27] god shall reveal even this unto you may
[33:30] god bless you to the reading of his word
[33:32] you may be seated
[33:34] this morning by the grace of god i just
[33:37] want to minister to you for a moment
[33:40] and i entitled it for getting those
[33:42] things amen
[33:44] forgetting those things
[33:46] i like you know how
[33:48] you know paul says
[33:50] you know in here and he was saying that
[33:52] you know brother and i counting out
[33:54] myself to apprehend it
[33:56] that to have apprehended but this one
[33:58] thing i do
[33:59] come on he's saying
[34:01] you know as he we can look at paul maybe
[34:03] in all of his achievements and things
[34:06] and maybe he looked at himself as his
[34:08] achievements and where he was in god and
[34:11] even some might have looked at him and
[34:12] say how the almighty man of god he was
[34:15] but he just letting the people know
[34:17] hey even though you might look at me as
[34:20] being a certain place i just want to let
[34:22] you know that i ain't there yet amen
[34:24] that i ain't apprehended yet he says but
[34:27] i'm still pressing myself
[34:30] he says toward that mark
[34:32] so
[34:32] and i says that you know even i was
[34:35] telling brother gerald this morning like
[34:36] my grandmother she was saying used to
[34:39] say sometimes that i wish the lord would
[34:41] just go ahead and take me on and i said
[34:44] to her many times i says well the lord
[34:46] ain't gonna take you until you're done
[34:48] with you yet come on i said long as
[34:50] you're still here that means that you
[34:52] still got a work to do
[34:54] and god is still working on you amen so
[34:57] we look at it that way that you know
[35:00] god's got us here for a purpose
[35:02] the reason why we're still here today
[35:04] and many have gone on is because god has
[35:07] still got something that he wants us to
[35:08] do
[35:09] and this even as paul was
[35:12] encouraging them there that you know
[35:14] that come on he says let us all be thus
[35:16] minded we got a race that we gotta run
[35:19] you believe that this morning
[35:21] we gotta race that we gotta run he says
[35:22] that he said i ain't apprehend he says
[35:25] but i'm pressing towards the mark of the
[35:26] high calling but this morning by the
[35:29] god's grace uh my my topic that i want
[35:32] to uh uh make emphasis on is even in
[35:36] doing your pressing towards the mark he
[35:38] says he says that you got to forget
[35:41] those things that are behind
[35:43] come on it's hard to move forward when
[35:45] you're looking behind
[35:47] it's hard to make any ground in progress
[35:50] when you're always looking back you
[35:52] believe that
[35:53] a man that's trying to move forward if
[35:55] he's looking back he might walk into a
[35:57] ditch or he might wreck into a car in
[35:59] front of him why because he's constantly
[36:01] looking back
[36:02] but paul says looking here though is
[36:06] many things that you might can reach
[36:07] back to
[36:09] i want you to forget about those things
[36:11] come on and and i know that that's hard
[36:14] sometimes as an individual and we want
[36:17] to deal with some of that even today i
[36:19] said you know sometimes it's hard to
[36:22] deal
[36:23] to not to forget certain things come on
[36:26] certain uh memories to deal with the
[36:29] memories some certain things in your
[36:31] life are certain there may have been
[36:33] certain turning points or certain places
[36:36] where you were in your life sometimes
[36:38] you know it's hard to forget those
[36:40] things and sometimes even that certain
[36:43] things that you won't forget come on but
[36:45] as i was sharing i was and i just kind
[36:47] of get over myself i was said lately you
[36:49] know that i've been kind of in the
[36:51] encouraging mode trying to encourage you
[36:54] know individuals that hey we got a race
[36:57] to run
[36:58] because what happens with the memory
[37:00] sometimes that the enemy he'll keep us
[37:03] captive to our memory
[37:05] he'll keep us captive to our past to
[37:08] where we can't go no further why because
[37:10] we're held in captivity but i says that
[37:13] god don't desire for us to be held in
[37:16] captivity sometimes we wonder why god
[37:19] does certain things
[37:20] i was sharing with my cousins last week
[37:23] and
[37:24] trying to encourage them after the
[37:25] funeral i says you know sometimes i says
[37:28] i don't ask god why anymore i know
[37:31] brother brother gerald was was preaching
[37:33] to me my sermon this morning well i said
[37:35] i don't i don't ask god why anymore come
[37:37] on i said because god's got a plan and
[37:40] everything come on and no matter how we
[37:43] look at the situation or how the
[37:44] situation looks
[37:46] we got to remember one thing
[37:48] that god's got it all in control
[37:51] and that all things
[37:53] going to work together for the good of
[37:54] them that love god
[37:56] god bringing stuff out of you but like i
[37:58] said being in an encouraging mode i was
[38:00] sharing with those i said there's
[38:02] certain things
[38:03] turning points in your life certain
[38:05] things that happen in your life that yes
[38:08] they they become a part of you so you
[38:10] can't forget them come on but i began to
[38:12] tell my cousin i says that you wonder
[38:15] why sometimes look like god will take
[38:17] the strongest link
[38:19] even in a family come on god or move
[38:21] them out of the way or sometimes in a
[38:23] church god move the strongest link out
[38:26] of the way and sometimes you wonder why
[38:28] god does that but god's got a purpose
[38:31] and everything come on because sometimes
[38:34] he wants you to rise up hallelujah
[38:36] he i believe it was isaiah said the year
[38:38] i mean he said the year that king gozai
[38:40] died he said what i saw the lord
[38:43] god moved to crutch what it was become a
[38:45] crutch from god moved it out away so
[38:48] then he can rise up hallelujah not
[38:50] saying that you say i'm a dethroned
[38:52] person and take their place no but god
[38:54] wants you to learn how to lean and
[38:57] depend on him do you believe that this
[38:59] morning so we find that i said so
[39:01] sometimes you know as things happen but
[39:04] nevertheless and i said god uh uh
[39:06] sometimes we go back down those memory
[39:09] lanes those uh memory lanes sometimes we
[39:12] go back down those those places and i
[39:14] said and i'm gonna say it like this is
[39:16] sometimes there's nothing wrong with
[39:18] look with going down that place because
[39:21] you human sometimes and that that
[39:23] becomes a part of you but don't let it
[39:25] drag you down come on
[39:26] don't let it bring you into captivity
[39:29] sometimes you got to mourn about it a
[39:31] little bit and then you got to pick up
[39:32] and go home come on in the middle of the
[39:35] battle you can't afford to stop and just
[39:37] give up and just start crying on the
[39:39] battlefield come on why because you in
[39:41] the you're in the heat of the battle
[39:43] it's a fight you got to remember the
[39:44] total objective is we got to win this
[39:46] race
[39:48] we got to fight this battle come on
[39:50] we still we still got demons and devils
[39:52] we got to fight
[39:54] we still got to pick gird up our lawns
[39:56] and go on after the enemy how we gonna
[39:58] do that when all the times we we
[40:00] allowing the devil to bring us back into
[40:02] captivity come on no that's why paul
[40:04] says forgetting those things
[40:06] which are behind i do what i press
[40:09] towards that mark how many want to press
[40:11] this morning so we find that i says that
[40:13] what it is a lot of times you know
[40:16] that's what the devil uses there's a lot
[40:18] of times of memory we know that uh uh i
[40:21] says how many times you know that when
[40:24] when god i say it like this coming out
[40:27] ain't it ain't the hardest thing going
[40:29] in is
[40:31] it's easy sometimes for god to bring a
[40:33] person out
[40:34] but not only did he bring you out he
[40:36] didn't bring you out just to stand there
[40:38] and lose come on delusion
[40:40] i say it all the time god didn't never
[40:42] save you to lose you
[40:44] come on but he that we just started to
[40:46] work he's able to finish the work
[40:49] and that's why we come to those places
[40:51] in our lives and understand that hey
[40:54] when you might have a lot of trials and
[40:57] tribulations may come your way lord i
[41:00] didn't start this journey on my own but
[41:02] god it was you that called me
[41:04] and the same one that called me i said
[41:06] lord i'm looking for you to finish it
[41:07] come on and the devil might come to you
[41:10] and like we're saying the other night
[41:11] look at your insufficiency look at what
[41:14] you ain't capable of but remember i
[41:16] wasn't never capable from the beginning
[41:18] i was lost from the beginning i was
[41:21] without hope from the beginning but the
[41:23] god that i served hallelujah he picked
[41:25] me up
[41:27] then and not only did he do that but he
[41:29] put me on my feet and i'm dependent on
[41:31] him
[41:32] hallelujah they're carrying me on the
[41:34] rest of the way i said are you depending
[41:36] on god this morning and that's what you
[41:38] know i say is that a lot of times you
[41:40] can look you can uh uh paul like he says
[41:43] forgetting those things he began to hear
[41:46] in the scriptures encourage the people
[41:48] he says what i want you to do
[41:50] when we look back at our past sometimes
[41:53] we look back at things that we can brag
[41:55] on
[41:56] so paul
[41:57] begin to let you know that if anybody
[41:59] can brag imma be the one that brag come
[42:01] on
[42:02] he says that how he was taught at the
[42:04] graffiti gamalia he says that i was a
[42:07] hebrew of the hebrew concerning zeal i i
[42:10] i i persecuted the church of god i got
[42:13] things that if we gonna brag i can brag
[42:15] for a while he says but all those things
[42:17] don't mean nothing come on
[42:19] he said all those things i had to count
[42:21] what loss
[42:23] i had to forget those things that were
[42:25] behind and when i came to god it's not
[42:27] that god what i could do for you but
[42:29] lord here i am lord clean me up
[42:32] oh jesus how many want god to clean him
[42:35] up this morning i said that's what it is
[42:38] he says that he don't want us
[42:40] here in the scriptures he don't want he
[42:42] says i don't want you to have confidence
[42:44] in the flesh
[42:45] come on
[42:47] confidence in your flesh and what you
[42:48] can do
[42:49] and that's why i believe that come on
[42:52] the grace of god is leading us to to do
[42:54] what let go of what your flesh and what
[42:57] you can do
[42:58] helpless
[42:59] in a case because if it ain't for god
[43:01] what will we be this morning
[43:03] but you know i say as he says here and
[43:06] you know i said how many times that god
[43:09] you know
[43:10] work to work in someone's life
[43:12] save them by a great deliverance and we
[43:15] can go through the scriptures save them
[43:17] by great deliverance only for them to
[43:20] not go into the land
[43:21] i said coming out is easy but going in
[43:24] is another come on because why when you
[43:27] come out yes it's god working miracles
[43:30] signs and wonders but you didn't see
[43:32] the the battles that were up ahead you
[43:35] didn't see the cold nights you didn't
[43:37] see the cold winters and the in the
[43:39] storms that were upper head but
[43:41] nevertheless to keep your eyes on the
[43:44] mark come on
[43:45] keep pressing towards the high calling
[43:48] that lord hallelujah it was you that
[43:51] brought me out i'm looking for you to
[43:52] take me in and that's what uh uh made
[43:55] the difference you know we look at
[43:58] i said many many things how uh we look
[44:01] at how
[44:02] god work delivers him many lives only
[44:04] for them to stumble along the way you
[44:06] know i says that many are called but
[44:08] what few are chosen
[44:10] you believe that this morning come on i
[44:12] come i come to encourage you it says you
[44:15] know god you know
[44:17] paul many times he always referred back
[44:20] to israel and how
[44:22] you know he's like i don't want you to
[44:24] be like them and how god will save them
[44:27] with a great deliverance
[44:29] to only do what destroy them because of
[44:32] their unbelief
[44:33] only for them to to to fall by the
[44:36] wayside all because they couldn't
[44:38] believe in god
[44:40] all because they they even though they
[44:42] came out naturally
[44:44] in their in their flesh in the body they
[44:46] came out but yet their hearts never came
[44:49] out yet the spirits were still in
[44:52] bondage to what memories of what took
[44:54] place in egypt how many believed that
[44:56] this morning why how did you know
[44:59] because every time that something went
[45:01] on every time in the journey when it
[45:04] looked like that god wouldn't give them
[45:07] uh what they wanted when they wanted
[45:09] hallelujah when it looks like that that
[45:12] god may have stepped aside which god
[45:14] never steps aside because he said i'll
[45:16] never leave you nor forsake you but when
[45:19] it looked it like that they always went
[45:22] back in their memory didn't they and
[45:24] began to say that hey were there no
[45:27] graves in egypt oh we can say some
[45:29] things sometimes when it looks like that
[45:32] god
[45:33] ain't doing like like they say what he
[45:35] said he'll do sometimes the devil
[45:37] through the memory will let us look back
[45:39] through those things and say i was
[45:41] better off hallelujah
[45:44] yesterday
[45:45] come on
[45:46] but nevertheless you know i said god
[45:48] know what he doing you know i was i was
[45:51] rebuking someone one time and they was
[45:54] getting talking about like i said how
[45:56] paul says forgetting those things that
[45:58] are behind
[45:59] i was talking to someone once and they
[46:01] was talking about how
[46:02] how they used to have such a good time
[46:05] in the nightclub and how they used to
[46:07] have such a good time and how they got
[46:09] together and we used to have a good time
[46:11] is what they say come on and i says what
[46:14] it is you saying that that reminds me of
[46:17] egypt and how they say i mean israel how
[46:19] they said oh when we were in egypt how
[46:21] we had bread and how we had meat and how
[46:24] we had those things come on you want to
[46:26] talk about the good old days hallelujah
[46:28] when you were bound in sin the good old
[46:31] days when you were bound to alcohol
[46:33] drugs and the things that had you bound
[46:35] sometimes we look back at those things
[46:37] in memory and call them the good old
[46:39] days
[46:40] hallelujah but how you think how you
[46:42] think when god when that reaches up to
[46:44] heaven how does god hear those things
[46:46] come on
[46:47] god is thinking about those times when
[46:49] you were in bondage but i said no the
[46:51] good days started hallelujah when god
[46:54] showed up the good thing they started
[46:56] when god began pulling on my heart when
[46:59] i didn't know what was calling me
[47:01] something was calling me out that's when
[47:02] the good old days started the good old
[47:05] days started when i could lift up my
[47:06] hands and walk into the house of god and
[47:09] freely worship him that's when the good
[47:11] old days started the good old days
[47:13] started when i could look to the cross
[47:15] and see a savior hallelujah
[47:19] i can realize that he done it for me
[47:21] that's when the good days started good
[47:24] day started when i realized that
[47:26] hallelujah that he died for not only the
[47:28] sins of everybody else but it was for me
[47:31] too that's when the good old days
[47:32] started good old days started when i
[47:34] could let down my burdens when i got up
[47:37] out the altar and the weights was lifted
[47:39] off of my shoulder that's when the good
[47:41] old days started hallelujah
[47:43] oh jesus
[47:45] come on
[47:46] but sometimes how i say how you think
[47:49] god feels looking out down on the people
[47:52] that he delivered by great deliverance
[47:55] come on but when times get a little
[47:58] tough
[47:59] come on then they say hey were there no
[48:01] grazing egypt come on why did god bring
[48:04] us out here to die he should have left
[48:06] us come on we might not say that from
[48:09] our natural mouths but in our spirits
[48:11] sometimes
[48:12] come on that's how we conduct ourselves
[48:14] do you believe that this morning
[48:16] come on finding ourselves in those type
[48:19] of conditions but i said god help us but
[48:21] what it is we got to forget those things
[48:23] that behind we got to forget about all
[48:26] of that and look forward hallelujah
[48:29] i said do you want to look forward this
[48:30] morning but we find that i say it's what
[48:32] it is you know
[48:35] god what he wants to do with you today
[48:37] just as you know god forgets your past
[48:41] do you believe that
[48:43] god wants you to let it go as well
[48:45] come on
[48:46] when you come to god and you know you
[48:48] accept what he's done for you at calvary
[48:52] except the blood that's been shed and he
[48:54] wipes away come on put you on a new page
[48:57] he says your sin and iniquities i would
[48:59] do what remember no more come on i want
[49:02] you to press forward i want you to go on
[49:04] hallelujah go on
[49:06] but sometimes that's hard for us to do
[49:09] isn't it
[49:10] sometimes that's hard for us to move
[49:12] past that place
[49:13] but we find that you know that's that's
[49:15] where god is calling us to do you
[49:17] believe that this morning i said as long
[49:19] as
[49:20] you know israel
[49:21] as long as even when they come out like
[49:23] it says forgetting those things that was
[49:25] behind as long as they couldn't forget
[49:28] those things that were behind what were
[49:30] they doing they were only spinning
[49:31] wheels
[49:33] come on
[49:34] they couldn't go forward
[49:36] long as they still had
[49:38] the things that have passed in their
[49:39] memory
[49:41] in their hearts they couldn't go forward
[49:44] they even know they went out and yes god
[49:46] was still with them leading them but
[49:47] they couldn't go into the land
[49:49] why because they couldn't be purged
[49:52] god couldn't purge them
[49:54] of those of their memories god couldn't
[49:56] purge them of the things that have
[49:58] passed so they can only do what spin
[50:00] wheels
[50:02] and many times that's what we find and i
[50:04] said come on you come past this mountain
[50:07] long enough lord i don't want to spin
[50:09] wheels no more come on but god i want to
[50:11] move forward come on he says leaving the
[50:14] the the principle and all these things
[50:16] he said let's do what let's move on
[50:18] let's go on in guard god's got places
[50:21] that he want to take you to he don't
[50:23] want to you don't want to
[50:24] deal with your dish here and deal with
[50:27] your next year on the same things or
[50:28] maybe you not even move forward but you
[50:31] move back a little bit but come on as
[50:33] the time go on and the years go on god
[50:36] wants you to move on and go on and go on
[50:38] inning guard do you believe that this
[50:40] morning hallelujah and that's what we
[50:42] find ourselves all the time even in
[50:45] those places come on we said lord
[50:48] yesterday is gone tomorrow may never be
[50:50] mine but lord i want to forget about
[50:53] those things and press towards that mark
[50:54] of the high calling i said do you want a
[50:56] press this morning
[50:58] but as long as you know
[51:00] as long as you know they can keep those
[51:02] things in their mind you know
[51:05] have the the fantasies
[51:08] or the things in their memories to keep
[51:11] those things in their minds
[51:13] come on it would always do what keep
[51:15] them and held them
[51:17] keep them held captive you know i
[51:19] thought about paul and how paul even he
[51:22] can go back even in his mind he had some
[51:25] low spots in his mind didn't he he had
[51:28] some low spots in his past so where he
[51:31] even persecuted the church of god i
[51:33] believe it was stephen and holly stoned
[51:35] and all these things but he understood
[51:38] that when that it was all in working it
[51:41] was all in the plan of god you say how
[51:43] could those things be in the plan of god
[51:45] we don't know sometimes how things work
[51:47] out but it was all in god's plan but
[51:49] somewhere in his paul's spirit somewhere
[51:52] in paul's walk he had to learn how to
[51:54] forget about those things he had to
[51:56] start over all over again and say hey
[51:59] let me start the day hallelujah and work
[52:02] and give god all i got but he had to
[52:04] find a way to do that but i said as long
[52:07] as we can fantasize on those things what
[52:10] it does it's top side it stops our
[52:12] events
[52:14] long as we got those things in our mind
[52:16] it stops our events come on
[52:18] long as we don't learn to forget those
[52:20] things i thought about
[52:22] lot's wife
[52:23] and how how hard like i said is
[52:26] forgetting those things that are behind
[52:28] come on she couldn't forget those things
[52:30] that were behind and what happened to
[52:31] her come on
[52:33] god brought him out didn't god bring him
[52:35] out
[52:36] but it wasn't long even after giving up
[52:38] because what he told them he even told
[52:40] him when he was bringing them out the
[52:42] bible says that while they yet lingered
[52:45] god being merciful to them come on grab
[52:47] them by the hands i say oh god is being
[52:50] merciful to us even today we see the
[52:53] signs of the time we know that god could
[52:55] come at any time and take his bride and
[52:57] catch his own home but yet what are we
[52:59] doing sometime in our spirit we're
[53:01] lingering
[53:03] come on
[53:04] lingering with the things of the world
[53:05] playing with the devil all the times but
[53:07] yet what is god doing even here this
[53:10] morning god is being merciful hallelujah
[53:13] god is grabbing us by the hand calling
[53:16] us to prayer calling us the consecration
[53:18] telling you i want you to let go
[53:20] hallelujah oh jesus do you believe that
[53:23] this morning come on god is soon to come
[53:27] we can preach that year in and year out
[53:29] but what happens in our spirit lingering
[53:32] come on
[53:34] but what it is god is calling us but the
[53:36] bible says god being merciful to them
[53:39] what were they lingering for hallelujah
[53:42] seeing that the city was going to be
[53:44] destroyed but nevertheless
[53:46] i believe that they can look around at
[53:48] sodom and gomorrah and the devil could
[53:51] have their minds blinded to the to the
[53:54] doom
[53:55] that was getting ready to hit the city
[53:57] have their minds blinded to the chaos
[54:00] that was getting ready to come because
[54:02] all of that looked more appealing
[54:04] hallelujah than the call of god what
[54:06] does the devil did to do today same
[54:09] thing make the world look more appealing
[54:12] hallelujah give you more money give you
[54:14] better cause give you better houses make
[54:16] everything look appealing to blind your
[54:19] eyes to the doom that's on the city come
[54:21] on but nevertheless god is still calling
[54:24] somebody'll hear that call somebody will
[54:26] say i want to let go of the world
[54:28] somebody will say i don't want money and
[54:30] i don't want fame but in the morning
[54:32] when i rise hallelujah give me jesus
[54:36] hallelujah
[54:37] i said in the morning come on let go but
[54:41] what it is they couldn't forget those
[54:43] things hard forgetting those things he
[54:46] came out one thing that the angels began
[54:48] to tell them hallelujah god brought you
[54:51] out but don't look back hallelujah
[54:54] forget those things that are behind you
[54:56] go on hallelujah
[54:58] enjoy the blessings and the grace of god
[55:02] but though they went out i could see
[55:04] that in her heart hallelujah she's still
[55:07] looking back wasn't she
[55:09] and what happened we know the story come
[55:12] on i said forgetting those things that
[55:14] are behind
[55:16] god calling us out to do what he says i
[55:18] want you to press
[55:21] paul said forgetting those things that
[55:22] are behind i want you to press
[55:25] come on
[55:26] press towards that mark
[55:28] are you pressing this morning come on
[55:31] forget forget what's behind you press
[55:34] sometimes like we said certain things
[55:36] that's embedded inside of you yes but
[55:38] nevertheless don't let it take you don't
[55:41] let it hold your cap hallelujah what you
[55:43] got to do sometimes you got to deal with
[55:46] it you gotta sometimes you gotta ask the
[55:48] lord to help you deal with it god help
[55:51] me hallelujah help me in my spirit god
[55:54] make me strong lord help me god and move
[55:57] on
[55:58] because if i stay here i'm gonna die
[56:00] lord if i stay here god i'll miss
[56:03] miss you're coming come on i said do you
[56:06] want to miss god coming this morning
[56:08] come on
[56:09] nobody don't want to miss god coming
[56:11] do you
[56:12] but what it is you want to press what
[56:14] all you got i said as long as they as
[56:16] they did those things come on
[56:18] fantasizing what happened
[56:22] that they couldn't move forward
[56:24] and it came to a place to where you know
[56:27] they never they never really were free
[56:30] they never really came out of bondage
[56:33] but what god did there in the end come
[56:36] on he had to deal with them and tell him
[56:39] all right he says since you don't know
[56:41] how to since you couldn't let the things
[56:44] of the past go
[56:45] he says that you know y'all won't y'all
[56:47] won't enter in he says but the young
[56:49] ones come on
[56:51] somebody that i can deal with
[56:53] hallelujah somebody that that maybe they
[56:56] didn't they were little children so
[56:58] maybe their memories in those areas
[57:00] didn't affect him he says but i'ma take
[57:03] of them and carry them into the land
[57:05] come on i say everybody quiet this
[57:07] morning
[57:10] forgetting those things come on
[57:12] but to take take those one and and bring
[57:15] them in what is god doing for us this
[57:17] morning come on
[57:19] i said where where are we sometimes we
[57:22] look at our lives and we look at year
[57:25] like i say it's 20 21 and i said god
[57:28] where are we come on
[57:30] what would the devil love to do woo our
[57:32] minds and say hey we just going on we
[57:35] just going on come on but this ain't
[57:37] where god intended for you to be come on
[57:39] god still intended for you to progress
[57:42] god is still intending
[57:44] for us to move and be changed from glory
[57:46] to glory sometimes we can't hear because
[57:49] of all the noise of the world because
[57:51] all of the noise and everything else
[57:53] around us but god is still beckoning his
[57:55] people god is still calling the voice of
[57:58] god is still going out but he says that
[58:00] he that hath the ear let him hear come
[58:02] on how are you going to have an ear
[58:04] because the holy ghost has to give you
[58:06] the ears come on you can't hear without
[58:08] the holy ghost you can't hear what the
[58:10] spirit is saying but he said that he
[58:12] that hath an ear i says god open our
[58:14] ears let us hear you calling god because
[58:17] if we can't hear you calling we'll miss
[58:19] you
[58:20] come on if we can't hear what you're
[58:22] saying we'll miss you
[58:24] i don't know about you but i says we
[58:26] don't want to run this race to miss him
[58:28] at the end what good would be all of the
[58:30] testimonies and how god brought you out
[58:33] and all the testimonies and all the
[58:35] shouting and the dancing on the reds on
[58:37] the other side of the red sea do if you
[58:39] don't make it over until the on the land
[58:42] to the into the land i said coming out
[58:44] is the easy thing but going in
[58:46] hallelujah oh jesus
[58:49] come on when they was going into the
[58:51] land what did god tell joshua he says
[58:54] that you're going to have to fight come
[58:55] on
[58:56] he says the land i'll give to you every
[58:58] place that the sole of your foot touched
[59:00] he said i'll give it to you hallelujah
[59:03] but you're gonna have to fight for it
[59:05] you're gonna have to press don't you
[59:07] worry about the giants that's in the
[59:09] land i've already displaced them for
[59:11] your sake but i still want you to fight
[59:14] hallelujah i still want you to press
[59:17] i don't know about you but i says when
[59:19] god calls a man he tells lets that man
[59:22] know that come on i'll never leave you
[59:24] nor forsake you i'll be with you even in
[59:27] you don't worry about the journey ahead
[59:29] i'm gonna fight all your battles
[59:32] hallelujah the night the night the
[59:34] nights might get dark sometimes the way
[59:36] it might get hard like paul says i had
[59:38] to suffer some things
[59:41] come on didn't paul say that he said i
[59:43] had to i had to suffer some things come
[59:46] on
[59:46] but nevertheless we counted all what joy
[59:50] because we know that weeping are doing
[59:52] for a night
[59:53] but joy is coming in the morning after
[59:55] you suffered a while come on god is
[59:58] going to strengthen you establish you
[1:00:00] and settle you hallelujah do you believe
[1:00:02] that this morning

[1:00:06] suffering through my pain and all those
[1:00:08] things i'm not worried about it why
[1:00:11] because i'm laying in the bosom of
[1:00:12] al-shadiyah hallelujah oh jesus

[1:00:21] to pray and ask god to help you
[1:00:24] come on
[1:00:26] sometimes you got to pray
[1:00:29] i say you got to pray
[1:00:31] and ask god to help you
[1:00:34] help you to overcome these things
[1:00:36] paul said forgetting those things which
[1:00:39] are behind sometimes you got to pray and
[1:00:41] ask god to help you
[1:00:43] sometimes you got to pray and ask god to
[1:00:45] give you strength sometimes you got to
[1:00:48] go tell them and say i'll shout y'all
[1:00:50] come on i want to lay in your bosom just

[1:00:56] old hallelujah jesus are the new god i
[1:00:59] need you sometimes you got to pray and

[1:01:08] need your peace sometimes you got to
[1:01:11] pray and ask god for things hallelujah
[1:01:14] oh jesus come on
[1:01:16] he said you have not because you asked
[1:01:18] not you know god liking us unto sheep
[1:01:22] why because they're such a helpless in
[1:01:24] the defense living defenseless animal
[1:01:26] come on
[1:01:27] they can't they have no defense against
[1:01:29] themselves but they look for the
[1:01:31] shepherd to be their defense
[1:01:33] come on and that's how god is is liking
[1:01:36] us to today what it is somebody says i'm
[1:01:39] a strong man i
[1:01:40] got strength and i got guns and i got
[1:01:42] all these things that don't mean nothing
[1:01:44] come on
[1:01:45] what it is we ain't fighting against
[1:01:47] flesh and blood but it's principalities
[1:01:50] and powers spiritual wickedness and high
[1:01:53] places but the weapons of our warfare
[1:01:55] are not carnal they're mighty through
[1:01:57] god hallelujah in the pulling down of
[1:01:59] strongholds yes there's powers that
[1:02:02] we're fighting but i know hallelujah the

[1:02:09] hallelujah the rain might be falling but
[1:02:12] i know to make all the rain
[1:02:13] hallelujah oh jesus come on i said
[1:02:17] forgetting those things you know i like
[1:02:21] that how paul was talking about it he
[1:02:24] says that i might know him in the power
[1:02:26] of his resurrection and the fellowship
[1:02:28] of his sufferings come on
[1:02:31] we know that that says what it is this
[1:02:33] morning we got to forget those things
[1:02:36] which are behind like i said
[1:02:38] it is hard i said it's hard but some
[1:02:41] things you know i was the lord was
[1:02:43] dealing with me
[1:02:44] on some things like i said even with
[1:02:46] memory i said what it is

[1:02:59] with brother gerald and i'll say it like
[1:03:01] this i says that you know even when my
[1:03:03] when my grandfather passed away i said
[1:03:06] it took me over a year to get over it
[1:03:09] i says it took me a while to deal with
[1:03:12] it
[1:03:13] because why i had all these things that
[1:03:15] would always come up
[1:03:17] come on in your memory all these things
[1:03:19] and which i said you can't get rid of
[1:03:21] certain things it says but it took me a
[1:03:23] long time not saying you got over it but
[1:03:26] to learn how to deal with it
[1:03:28] but what it is in the end you found out
[1:03:30] what it was it was the enemy come on
[1:03:33] working with certain
[1:03:35] places in your spirit to do what keep
[1:03:38] you from progressing keep you from
[1:03:40] growing keeping you from doing what
[1:03:42] going on in god as we said today that
[1:03:45] sometimes i mean the other night we look
[1:03:47] at those that have gone on and we say
[1:03:49] hey when lord knows we're going to see
[1:03:52] him again one day but in order for us to
[1:03:54] see him again one day we got to finish
[1:03:56] the race that we're running come on we
[1:03:58] still got a race to run we still got
