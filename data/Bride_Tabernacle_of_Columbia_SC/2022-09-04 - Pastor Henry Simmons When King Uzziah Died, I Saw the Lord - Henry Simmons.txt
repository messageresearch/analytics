yourself to us lord that we can draw closer to you in jesus name we pray amen isaiah 6 1-8 i read the first you read the next one we read they first together in the year the king uzziah died i saw [Music] also the lord setting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple too and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory for then said i woe it's me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwelled in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the lord of host 6. and he's and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched our lips and thy knickers is taken away and the sins perished together also i heard a voice of the lord saying whom shall i sin and who will go for us then said i hear am i send me amen god bless you read this word you may be seated isaiah was facing a period of time in life amen with his eyes as the prophet of god says his eyes was fashioned on king god's eye and ozzie was the thing that he was seeing because as i was a good king and other perhaps of somebody that the young isaiah the prophet could look up to and sometimes we have people in our lives that we look up to and um and sometimes the person that's in our lives are the thing that's in our lives and we want to talk to you uh this morning about when king anzai died i saw the lord when king as i uh uzziah died i saw the lord when king uzziah died i saw the lord now like i said as the prophet brought out there sometimes we're looking at the somebody that's got great influence in our lives and we're looking at them and i'm i i i'm to say you know sometimes i've looked at people that you want to try to be like this or be like this one or be like that one and sometimes we think that that's what they're successful especially looking at somebody that looked like god was with him and god was blessing him and the man looked like he had a fear of god and um so it was a good person no matter how good the person is sometimes things can blind you from seeing the lord sometimes we can put our confidence and our trust in what appears to be good sometimes it could be your father your mother your sister sometimes it can be the pastor it can be the prophet or whatever whatever your king is now realizing that he didn't have his confidence and his faith and anybody this person was a king and the bible tells us he was a good king but sometimes even with all our good sometimes we can allow a little bad to come in are you with me i'm going to um focus a little bit on the second chronicles 26. things happen in king azad alive and no doubt isaiah was a witness to things turning in the king ozzie life desire life and caleb being up front i wanted to read something but that's all right josh your mind getting it second chronicles 26. okay 26 16. go right here josh oh but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for the transgress against the lord his god went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar now the bible says here but when he was strong you know sometimes not when we're weak that we do things but when he was strong his heart was what his heart was lifted up are y'all with me you know sometimes we could be strong in the lord and god can use us in great ways but in his strength his heart got lifted up amen brother and sister and you know that's what god you know we have to be careful and watchful we can go on with the lord and god can use us in mighty in great ways but it's easy to get lifted up and think amen that we can do what we're not supposed to do we can uh do what we're not supposed to do brother and sister we always gotta stay humble humble before god for the minute we think that we are so blessed that we can do what we want amen and nobody can say or do nothing about it because i am strong in the lord the bible said when he was strong his heart got lifted up not when he was weak you see that many times when we're weak we depend on god amen we stay humble and we trust the word you should have left it down that's all right but anyway well when we strong it's hard to tell somebody you know things when they're strong it's hard to get it over to somebody when they're strong because you can't tell a strong person no amen amen you see what i'm saying right sometimes spiritually we get strong in the lord and in the power of his might you know and sometimes the thing just twisted a little bit just don't take but a little bit of self to get in it just a little bit of you getting it just a little bit of flesh the devil just twists you just just a teeny bit and there's no more god are you with me now this is what happened to uzziah um she said and when he was strong his heart got lifted up to to his destruction [Music] go ahead read boy he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense okay what's wrong with that what's wrong with him doing something that is good to offer incense before the lord go ahead and azariah the priest went in after him and with him four score priests of the lord that were valiant men you know this man was a king so as a riot get me some help this is the king and me going against the king i'm just i'm just a priest but this man is a king and the king he's supposed to know better you know sometimes we take for granted that the king would know better we take for granted that the spiritual and strong and the person that god used modernly and powerful ought to know better sometimes we think the pastor ought to know better sometimes we think amen uh uh mama ought to know better daddy ought to know better we might think that the one that's more spiritual than i ought to know better ought to understand what they're doing but it don't take but a little deception for our heart to get lifted up amen just a little twist but because we know that we are strong and we know that the lord is with us and we know that how blessed we are and how god has moved in our life and how god has demonstrated his glory and how the power of god is with us okay okay okay god is with me and god is working in my life and god oh god is favoring me this king had done exploits he wasn't just anybody he was blessed of the lord go ahead and they withstood uzziah the king so it's it takes tolls that even though the king was strong and god had blessed him and no doubt where israel was and how blessed israel was the king had a lot to do with that because his zeal for god and how he stood for god he had a lot to do with their blessing but yet amen they saw the king hard you know you got to be careful you got to you got to watch the word and you got to stay with the word regardless of who it is amen because regardless of their position or their title or who oh god you got to stick with the word it doesn't make a difference who it is i'm glad for as a writer go ahead he said you got a lot he got a lot of help sometimes when somebody get off it's hard to find help the help the person that's got off somebody get off and use they off the word after work can you come help me oh no you take care oh no i i ain't messing with that you ever seen somebody off and you wanted some help and and i ain't getting involved with that that that between them and law why it may be it may be your king it may be the one that you you you know you're looking at the one that's you know you know that's causing you to be blind amen and not when you you're not gonna touch because they he was strong in the lord so you say well i i don't touch them because you know the bible said touch not my anointing and do my prophet no harm are you with me so you say well i'ma leave that alone but i i believe that somebody was there to see amen he's doing something that he's not supposed to do and i and we're going to go to him and tell him don't you do that go ahead don't read in an opportunity not unto thee isaiah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the son of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense see certain things belong to the ministry you don't go and share things that i pertain to the ministry are you with me [Music] see he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and some teachers and these things were for the perfecting of the saints for the edified in the body of christ are you with me so we have to stay in our position we just can't say because uh who i am because i'm strong in the law and god is working mightily with me then i can take on my own headship are you with me the bible said his he got lifted up and i'm gonna do my own thing it doesn't matter what the words say i'm gonna do what i because i am who i am i am strong in the lord so i'm gonna do what i say oh oh wait a minute what what happened go out of the sanctuary for thou has trespassed neither shall it be and not honor for the lord god okay what you're doing it will not honor the lord you're not supposed to do it it will not honor the lord are you with me see what we do is it for god's honor and what is it according to the word or will it honor the lord not because i can do it i'm saying will it honor the lord amen amen amen are you look man it wasn't the you know it it looked like it was all right they offer incense to the lord it's all right to do this until the lord it's all right because amen that's what we're supposed to offer and sent to the lord but it's not your position to do amen it's the priest's position to do that amen okay you are out of your position amen are you with me okay go ahead then uzziah was robbed and had a sentence can you see people who oh i'm king i'm strong and low you're telling me me your king what to do can you see this king will god doesn't use him mightily powerful king there was a right in the side of the lord powerful king but he getting off and somebody going to challenge you off the wire king ain't too many people when they get off the word once they've been used moderately and powerfully they can humble themselves down amen to listen to anybody because i am the pastor are you with me i am the pastor i'm the bishop i'm just can you humble yourself can you get off your high horse and humble yourself when you're wrong when you're off the word will you be humble enough to admit i am wrong i told him not in mullins the other night i said many times i made mistakes then i was asking the minister you ever made a mistake how about you i said we can't admit we make mistakes it's something wrong if the preacher in the pulpit every time he get up if he always saying a hundred percent you can trust and he don't get off sometimes something wrong but i have to come back and say y'all forgive me i got off a little bit maybe and not so much what you say how you say it are you and then you got to say well i you know some sometimes somebody has to remind you come to you and say pastor hey say oh y'all forgive me amen that's one thing i used to always say to the sanctioned mullen i would always appreciate brother flagen i know he had my back all the time and sometimes i you know sometimes pressure can get on you pretty heavy in the pulpit and sometimes you can come in to put bit and you can go all foo foo and i sometimes i would come especially as a young fellow he'd come to me right now you need a break you need a break you need to go take a risk y'all forgive me and then he said take up take a break take a break you need a rest sometimes it all in needing to rest sometimes and because he loved me and cared about he didn't want me he meant to look like that in front of the people see what i'm saying somebody got your back and you know i and i asked him i said brother did when you corrected me that ever i say you're wrong don't help no i said thank you it was always thank you i appreciate that you see what i'm saying i said through the years i said you know and that's what you want you want somebody to say something and and you'll be humble enough to say thank you for giving and telling people forgive me you know what i'm saying so by the grace of god when we cannot do that no more amen then it causes us to get a little bit lifted a little bit more higher but we got to be always willing to be corrected amen because sometimes when other folks see you you can't see yourself and sometimes you can inflict amen pain that you don't know nothing about somebody was telling me that the day sometimes we can set things we didn't even know we heard somebody feel it and they they hurt and hurt and bad and you would never do it until they told you but sometimes it took years before they told you but when they told you oh lord didn't even know it you know what i'm saying so brother and sister and you might tell me oh oh you're the only one do that i'ma tell you something the only way you never done it i don't do it you the same as a perfect man are you offended not in the word are you with me that means you can't talk because sure enough some kind of way you might talk just a little bit but some kind of way the devil might twist what you're saying are you with me and i found some mighty sweet people that i said they just is loving and kind i can't find a phone in them but i guarantee you they still make mistakes okay go right here and had a sensor in his hand to burn incense see first of all he got mad and when you get mad at somebody that's the wrong spirit anyway he got wrong he got mad somebody come to you to try to help you stay with the word and you get mad at him let me tell you the first thing when somebody tried to correct and you know one brother was telling me something he was 100 right on what he was telling me and i believe he was right but you know what he started doing he pulled out all the faults in the people in the church and when he did that i said huh that's the wrong spirit amen i ain't gonna handle the situation for him because one what he did was he pointed out the fault of everybody in the church that was off that he knew see what i'm saying and i said now once you've done wrong deal with your wrong and you deal with that alone are you with me he was saying what that one wrong doesn't wrong that one and so and they were worse than me now you come for repentance and you come to get right and you're telling me about all these other folk in the church i was you know handling the case for him and a situation for him and i said that brother ain't ready you want to come back to church when he ready to come back to church because you don't begin to justify if you're wrong and you got the right spirit of repentance just go ahead on and say lord it's me it's me oh lord standing in the lead of breath not nobody but me that's all i want to deal with because don't measure yourself by yourself by other folks just deal with you let god deal with with them on their own thing and god deal with you but here he got he got angry i i guess he said well the way god used me you might have used me more powerful than you priests look what look what god had done in under my administration is king amen if if if i wasn't king y'all wouldn't have been where y'all are look what kind of condition y'all was in when i became king and look what i had to do amen to get the kingdom back on track and y'all come up here telling me what i can't do watch me watch me show y'all you see what i'm saying you see what we because he was strong in the lord because god had used him so favorably he said and you say i was wrought with the incense and while he was what while he was wrought with the priest what happened left to say what in his forehead that's a good place for it to rise up where everybody can see it left as it rolls up in his forehead are you with me the mark in the hand and the mark in the head he's talking about the mark of the beast leftist rolls up in his forehead and and forehead before the priest in the house of the lord from beside this incent altar read on kill in azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from dents yea himself hasted also to go out you know sometimes we wait till god had to do something about it sometimes we we don't listen to god saying i i'm going because he love i believe god loved this king amen because his love for the king he smote him with lepers he could have killed him and just dropped him dead amen are you a man because what you're doing is not pertaining to you you know i i believe the king thought y'all can do it i do a better job you know i i i know i i know what need to be done you know sometimes folks take matters in their own hand they don't wait on the lord to handle things i'm gonna take things in my own hand you know you can tell when leprosy spiritual legacy had caught a hole people began to separate themselves from the other people thanks why because and because they meant they become contagious [Music] legacy was a type of sin and sin will cause you to be separated from the people of god and from the house of god and from the temple of god are you a man see sin amen immediately when lapis distracts even not only did they do it but the uzziah did it himself are you with me but let me go back to isaiah here and uh in the year king as i died i i won't be long i hopefully we we're getting the point home in the year king oz i died i saw the law amen i saw the lord praise god evidently this man was a prophet of god ordained before the foundation of the world yet his gift that was in him [Music] was blinded by a king that he loved and admired the gift that's in us sometimes it meant it's hindered and blind by a king that we are a king i want to say who or what is your desire that's keeping you from seeing the lord what is it who is it or what would do that what would blind you amen from seeing the lord and and what happened to isaiah amen us he had to die he meant because god wanted you to see the lord when god wants you to see the lord amen he began to move things out of your way that's obstructing and keeping your sight from amen seeing the glory of god because god wants you to see his glory because god has a things he meant that he wants to do with you places he wants to take oh god god wants to do something in your life they meant so sometimes god has to stop for a minute began to move things off even from you move conditions and problems the situation that hinders you that will stop you from seeing his glory amen god wants you to see his glory praise god and god wants to amen for you to see him and when uh uh there was another king that god wanted to introduce isaiah to amen and i and isaiah amen he said i saw the lord and he was high and he was lifted up oh hallelujah and his strain filled the temple his glory amen oh god let your glory fill my temple lord let the glory of the lord fill the temple amen praise god isaiah saw the one that set it on the throne he saw that amen the king amen that was above him and that physical thing that was blinding him that thing that was actually it meant he got a chance to look into the heavenly and he saw the real king the one that he was supposed to be looking at the one that amen was waiting amen for isaiah to step into his ministry to step into his glory to be exposed amen to what god wanted to do in his life i'm saying to you what god wants to do in your life amen how god wants to use you as an individual amen things amen praise god sometimes would hinder they meant god for moving and showing you his glory praise god hallelujah and he said i saw the lord amen and he was high and lifted up and his train did fill the temple and then he began to strive amen holy holy is the lord god almighty praise god hallelujah isaiah said ha-ha wait a minute oh whoa is me oh hallelujah now god is dealing with isaiah before he met praise god oh he was dealing with uzia and isaiah was a mine he was a spectator amen but now i ain't that praise god god wants to use him amen god wants to use him to take him into a place amen of higher heights and deeper depths and god wants to use you to take you in places they meant that you've never been before hey god god wants to do that in your life amen now amen but before he does that amen you got to recognize i must repent i must say loud amen i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwelled in amen among the people with unclean lord i'm undone i need help i need your grace i need your mercy lord i want it amen praise god when you saw the lord he wants to come he began to humble himself before the lord and realize the lord amen because i've seen your glory amen i've seen amen once you looked up amen and you see calvary lifted up and you see jesus was lifted up for you amen you see jesus died for your sins and you see yourself as a sinner and you see yourself oh god you're my savior you're my lord you're my king and i need you hallelujah i need you jesus amen praise god because when he saw him he saw the need and he saw his condition he saw how frail he was he saw how how sinful he was he needed help because he saw how holy god was it wasn't talking about nobody else it was a god dealing with him and god wants to deal with you as an individual praise god not your usia not to he meant not somebody else not the king that's blind in you not the thing that that's keeping you blind and away from the presence of god and god you're using you i want to use you praise god each and every one of us god wants to use you in his own special way and we must yield and surrender to him and isaiah said that god took coal off the altar and he touched my lips amen god realized that isaiah cried out and god amen took the cold and he touched him because he understood he was unclean and he needed help god can come to your rescue amen you got to see your condition [Music] until you see your condition amen you're not going to ask for help amen praise god and you see a holy god a god that you need mercy and grace from and he wants to give it to you they met the reason why god shows isaiah himself i mean him his glory because god wanted him to have it praise god god showed it amen because this is what i want you to have praise god i want you to have the glory of the lord praise god i want it to be in your life praise god that's what god i'm gonna tell you that's what it's all about you come in the house of the lord and god wants to amen for you to enter into his glory praise god god wants to glorify you amen the glory that i had with you the father before the world was that's what jesus father glorified them amen even as amen the glory amen that we had which before the world was amen god give me that glory again you amen father make them one even as we are one amen god i want you to give them the glory praise god i want you to have the glory this morning i want you to have that glory amen that you saw in the temple even when as i died i saw the law praise god then if one flew one of the servants flew having a live coal in his hand which had taken with the tongue from off the altar and he laid up it upon my mouth and said lo this touched our lips and the iniquities are taken away amen and our sins purge and he said and also a verse said also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i are you with me whom shall i what sin whom shall i sin whom shall i sin and who will what i want to know can you hear him is he speaking to isaiah say lord speak to me lord speak to me let it not just speak to isaiah but lord you spoke to isaiah for lord speak to me how would you like for god to speak to you this morning where you say if he speaks to you then what do you want him to do lord speak to me and then isaiah said when lord spoke he says what here are you there are you there this morning he said here am i what see he wasn't ready to go because josiah was there and i said i wasn't ready to go he was so busy looking at josiah and he said send me what i will god was waiting he's just waiting on you to get that thing that's blinding you out the way and god has to take it out the way for you to go let us stand for you to go praise god are you willing to let the king the thing that seemed to be dominant in your life that's keeping you away from the glory of god and from god using you to the full extent as you know he would like to are you willing to let that king died to let the king of glory come in let the king of glory the king of kings the only potent king praise god who has immortality and brings it to the light through the gospel are you willing to let the king of kings come in who will go for us who will i send and who would go for us and he said let us buy our heads as our heads up our hearts are looking to him said send me how many you willing if god would speak to you this morning are you willing to go will you say sin thank you send me lord thank you i'm willing to go i'm willing to let us i the king uzziah die this morning and send me i'll go thank you for all your hands of hearts father in the precious name of jesus christ lord it's just about everybody's hands is up hard to open god because somewhere you knocked somebody is opening the door somewhere you
