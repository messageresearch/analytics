[32:46] jesus wonderful name we pray amen
[32:51] hebrews 1
[32:55] praise god
[32:57] and one
[32:58] god who in sun-dried times
[33:02] and in divers of different manners
[33:05] speak in time past until the fathers by
[33:08] the prophets has in these last days
[33:11] spoken unto us
[33:12] by a son whom he has appointed heir of
[33:15] all things but whom also he made the
[33:17] world
[33:18] will be in the brightness of his glory
[33:20] the express image of his person
[33:23] and upholding all things by the word of
[33:25] his power
[33:26] when he had by himself purge our sins
[33:28] sat down at the right hand
[33:31] of the majesty on high
[33:34] god bless the religious words you may be
[33:35] seated
[33:40] god is good i was
[33:43] just praying i have several things that
[33:45] i would like to share with you today
[33:48] and hopefully they'll come out and
[33:51] try to
[33:52] duck tail together if they don't then
[33:55] they may god bless you
[33:58] okay we just want to speak some things
[34:00] that's on our heart
[34:02] it's we were praying about
[34:05] different things and
[34:07] in psalms 46 we noticed that we were
[34:10] saying that we will speak on christ
[34:13] revealing his own word
[34:15] this morning and
[34:17] then hebrews tell us god in sun-dried
[34:19] times in different manners speaking time
[34:22] fast to the fathers by the prophet has
[34:24] in these last days spoken at us by son
[34:28] so by the grace of god we know that
[34:30] the holy spirit
[34:32] amen is in the church today and god
[34:36] speaking through us through his son
[34:38] through the holy ghost
[34:40] so by the grace of god
[34:42] as we look at psalms 46
[34:45] i want i chose for a sub-topic
[34:48] god is our refuge
[34:51] god is our refuge this morning
[34:54] and uh i may dwell more on one of the
[34:57] other god is our refuge
[35:00] he says god is our refuge and our
[35:02] strength
[35:03] a very present help in trouble
[35:08] god is our refuge and our strength a
[35:10] very present help
[35:12] in trouble
[35:14] the prophet of god says and
[35:17] christ revealed in his own word he's
[35:19] talking about
[35:21] that
[35:23] something that would help stabilize the
[35:26] people
[35:29] god would give god has given us
[35:31] something and he was talking about the
[35:32] word of god giving them something that
[35:34] would stabilize the people
[35:37] you see it becomes
[35:38] of the condition of the world
[35:40] and that's back then it was very
[35:43] neurotic time
[35:45] people are in such a nervous condition
[35:48] the world
[35:49] and then he says the statement is
[35:51] he says it said
[35:54] he was talking about the future that
[35:56] we'll be passing through
[35:58] on dangerous and treacherous waters
[36:02] we'll be passing through dangers dangers
[36:06] and treacherous waters
[36:09] in the midst of passing through dangers
[36:13] and treacherous waters
[36:16] we're going to need a refuge
[36:19] amen he said the plagues
[36:21] things that's going to hit the earth
[36:25] we're gonna be we're gonna need god he
[36:27] says
[36:28] because these
[36:30] vows he was talking about
[36:32] so by the grace of god we know that god
[36:36] is preparing his people
[36:38] amen for what the oncoming stone
[36:42] so god is preparing you and i to get out
[36:44] of here
[36:45] now whether we take advantage of the
[36:47] preparation that god has afforded us
[36:50] that's up to you and i
[36:52] but for those that signed crime because
[36:55] of the abomination done in the city
[36:57] those that would seek god no those would
[36:59] that would see the need of an urgency
[37:03] is in my spirit that
[37:06] uh that would take the word of god
[37:08] seriously
[37:11] see because a lot of folks are not
[37:13] serious about their soul salvation
[37:18] they're not serious about their walk
[37:20] with christ
[37:22] the bible says that we ought to take the
[37:24] most earnest he
[37:27] to the things which we've heard at least
[37:29] at any time
[37:32] we'll let him slip
[37:34] then he said how shall we escape
[37:36] who neglect so great in salvation
[37:39] god is looking for us to take them on
[37:42] get serious about
[37:44] going to heaven
[37:48] get serious get down to business
[37:51] amen we need to take take take your trip
[37:55] to heaven seriously
[37:57] and sometimes i think we don't take it
[38:00] our soul salvation serious
[38:04] we don't really get down to earnestly
[38:06] considering
[38:08] that i had a soul
[38:12] and that
[38:13] god one day you gonna say your soul is

[38:44] you value your job more than your value

[38:52] to offer
[38:53] because it's more valuable are you with
[38:56] me
[38:57] but seem as though we don't even value
[38:58] our lines that's why people are just
[39:00] shooting one another down that's why
[39:02] folks are throwing it away
[39:06] because they don't see any value
[39:09] any value in it
[39:12] if you don't see value you'll throw it
[39:14] away
[39:15] i mean you'll put it in the garbage can
[39:18] put it on the trash pile
[39:20] it has no value
[39:22] and some people are just trashing up
[39:24] their lives
[39:25] is it their value
[39:27] because they don't have no value
[39:30] they don't have no nothing
[39:32] no principle nothing their life ain't
[39:34] worth nothing
[39:37] they're smoking up their dope it up
[39:39] they're shooting it up they'll
[39:44] they don't care how they treat it
[39:48] this is like a individual in the natural
[39:50] don't care how they treat their bodies
[39:54] they'll fornicate they'll commit
[39:56] adultery they'll do anything
[39:58] and not they don't value it
[40:01] it's not nothing sacred about it nothing
[40:03] holy about they don't care this just do
[40:06] what you want with it it ain't no good
[40:08] anyway
[40:10] just do what you want ain't no good
[40:12] i said i value it
[40:14] i don't care how i look i don't care how
[40:17] it's only when
[40:21] when one is laying on the sickbed one is
[40:23] in a in a desperate situation
[40:26] and then they get to want to live and
[40:28] not die they begin to cry out
[40:32] somebody help me
[40:35] if god if you're there or do something
[40:38] then it becomes valuable
[40:40] but other than that
[40:42] we it has no value
[40:44] we just wake up in the morning i'm just
[40:46] here i don't even know why i'm here
[40:49] i'm just living i don't even know why
[40:50] i'm living i don't know where you i
[40:53] don't even have a purpose
[40:54] i don't even have a care i don't even
[40:56] have a purpose i don't even care one way
[40:59] or another live or die
[41:02] and that's what we're facing
[41:04] moses was telling me about the school
[41:07] house
[41:08] and uh that the children just gone wild
[41:10] crazy
[41:12] and you know then rachel was telling me
[41:14] about it and everybody's talking about
[41:16] the school it's just it's out of control
[41:20] so
[41:21] i know when
[41:23] we're in desperate times where
[41:26] people are unstable mentally
[41:28] tick-tock is taking advantage
[41:31] i don't even know what it is but y'all
[41:33] know what it is
[41:35] you know
[41:36] but by the grace of god we got to come
[41:39] down and get serious about god
[41:42] is your life of any importance and
[41:44] anything of value to you as a person do
[41:47] you care anything about
[41:50] your soul
[41:52] do you care anything about you
[41:55] do you want to
[41:57] be blessed do you want to prosper do you
[41:59] want to have value
[42:02] you know
[42:03] the dollar is losing its value
[42:06] everything is losing value
[42:10] see something that is valuable to you
[42:12] you hold it dear
[42:15] it's precious to you
[42:18] you know sometimes our marriages
[42:20] lose value
[42:22] sometimes you know our family loses
[42:24] value
[42:26] and sometimes
[42:27] the thing that we value god does not
[42:30] value
[42:31] sometimes we the things that we put in
[42:33] front of god
[42:35] sometimes the things that is more
[42:36] important to us than our soul then god
[42:39] looks down at it
[42:41] and god understands that you're putting
[42:43] things in front of me
[42:46] and you're valuing
[42:47] things more than you value me
[42:50] he said i'm a jealous god
[42:52] and i have no other god before me
[42:56] see sometimes we
[42:58] we think that god
[43:00] is
[43:01] god you're not important to me
[43:04] you're not valuable to me
[43:07] it's only when we need him is he
[43:08] valuable
[43:10] when we need him then he means something
[43:14] he's valuable he's important but as long
[43:16] as we don't need him he's of no value
[43:20] are you ready
[43:22] praise god
[43:24] the spare tire is not important till you
[43:26] get a flat
[43:29] are you with me
[43:30] but god is like a spare tire we don't
[43:33] need him until we get a flat
[43:36] are you with me
[43:38] and then you see the value of having
[43:40] this oh god don't don't do god like that
[43:44] because when you need him
[43:47] he may not be there for you
[43:49] why
[43:51] because amen you
[43:55] when he
[43:56] gave you the opportunity to serve him to
[43:58] worship him to trust him
[44:02] and to know him
[44:04] you didn't want him
[44:06] but when you need him you say well okay
[44:08] god come on
[44:10] you know it's like god is
[44:13] you know he's not look like a puppy on
[44:16] the string or something like that you
[44:17] can just do it like you wanna
[44:22] god is the one that made us
[44:26] amen not we ourselves
[44:28] so you can't do god any kind of way and
[44:31] expect
[44:34] god just to be there for you
[44:37] that's what the world doing
[44:39] well i you know
[44:41] i just party do any kind of crazy stuff
[44:44] and i said oh god
[44:46] thank you for being my god
[44:48] you know
[44:51] they give god no respect
[44:54] they give god no honor
[44:57] god is irrelevant
[45:00] he's not important but yet we say he's
[45:03] god
[45:04] do you believe in god i believe in god
[45:07] do you believe in jesus i believe my
[45:09] savior
[45:11] okay
[45:12] here
[45:14] david
[45:15] says god is
[45:17] i mean the song it says
[45:18] god is our refuge
[45:21] and our strength
[45:24] a very
[45:25] present help
[45:27] a very present help not just a health
[45:30] now
[45:31] he's a
[45:32] present help sometimes we think about
[45:34] the god of the past
[45:39] god of yesterday
[45:41] to every to most people god is a god of
[45:44] yesterday and not a god of the presence
[45:49] but you really must understand that god
[45:50] is a god present he's a present tense
[45:53] god
[45:55] and the bible tells us
[45:57] god is revealing his own word
[46:02] in the beginning was the word
[46:04] and the word was with god and the word
[46:05] was god
[46:09] god was revealing himself in david as
[46:12] king and then solomon this peace
[46:17] he was revealing himself unto abraham
[46:20] as
[46:21] the father of the faith
[46:23] god was revealing himself with moses as
[46:25] a deliverer
[46:28] are you with me
[46:30] god reveals himself an elijah
[46:33] amen
[46:35] praise god he had as the one that
[46:38] restored the people back to the world
[46:40] god was in the prophets
[46:43] god was revealing himself in his own
[46:44] word throughout all ages christ was
[46:47] identif identified throughout all ages
[46:51] praise god
[46:52] but brother and sister we come down to a
[46:55] place
[46:56] in god that we need our
[46:59] own
[47:00] personal experience
[47:04] we must have our own personal experience
[47:08] not moses
[47:12] knew him as
[47:14] a deliverer
[47:18] and noah knew him as a
[47:22] as a savior that he was able to save him
[47:25] from the flood
[47:28] but
[47:29] god revealing himself to noah in that
[47:32] day
[47:32] and gave him a revelation what he was
[47:34] requiring in that day
[47:37] see when god reveals himself to you
[47:40] in his own word then he also gives you
[47:43] amen a revelation he gives you
[47:46] a refuge
[47:48] he gives you a place
[47:50] amen that you can go
[47:53] and hide
[47:55] so god gives us a safety place
[47:59] so it's very important that's why uh
[48:02] the bible says
[48:04] uh the name of the lord is the strong
[48:06] tower the righteous running thing in and
[48:09] they're safe
[48:11] see we need to be safe save from all in
[48:14] the school the children need to have a
[48:16] safe
[48:17] a place of safety
[48:20] i mean in a world
[48:22] that's full of chaos and darkness
[48:24] where can i find safety
[48:27] where can i find a place
[48:29] to
[48:32] hide i'm i'm talking about
[48:36] as dangerous as this world is getting
[48:39] we need a place of safety
[48:42] now
[48:45] let me go in the time
[48:47] it
[48:48] helped in trouble
[48:50] a very present help in trouble
[48:53] job talked about in job 14 a man that's
[48:56] born of a woman is a few days in full of
[48:58] what
[48:59] now if you don't have any troubles then
[49:01] maybe you weren't born of a woman
[49:04] children are have troubles and problems
[49:07] have difficulty
[49:08] have times where they don't even know
[49:11] you know
[49:13] they don't even know why they are
[49:15] trouble
[49:17] they don't know why they are feeling the
[49:19] way they feel
[49:22] sometimes they feel lonely sometimes
[49:24] they feel forsaken sometimes they feel
[49:26] like what is my purpose
[49:33] the answer is in god
[49:36] the answer is here for you
[49:39] but sometimes we don't want to end
[49:41] we don't really value we don't really
[49:44] want the true answer that god has given
[49:46] us
[49:47] god is our refuge and our strength
[49:51] a very present hell
[49:56] the very present help
[49:59] in trouble
[50:01] okay
[50:02] so i know
[50:04] i know about trouble
[50:06] and i know that we're facing troubled
[50:08] times
[50:10] and i know the world is in trouble
[50:13] praise god and i know you're going to
[50:15] run into trouble
[50:18] you might not want to face your trouble
[50:21] that's why sometimes we try to do things
[50:23] to escape trouble
[50:26] we try to do things to shape trouble
[50:29] but trouble is facing you every day
[50:32] when you wake up and look in the mirror
[50:33] you're looking at trouble
[50:36] when you look at your job trouble
[50:39] look at the school trouble
[50:41] look at the world trouble
[50:44] everywhere you look trouble
[50:47] but
[50:48] the option the place is saying god is
[50:51] our refuge
[50:55] in the time when we need strength
[50:58] god will give us strength
[51:02] in this presence the stress this present
[51:05] atmosphere that we're living in god will
[51:09] give us strength
[51:12] brother and sister we need strength
[51:15] strength to keep children out of prison
[51:20] the
[51:21] lines our minds
[51:23] to keep our hearts
[51:25] we need
[51:27] we need an anchor
[51:29] we need help
[51:32] we need help
[51:34] and he's got present help
[51:37] if we allow him to help us
[51:40] if we want help
[51:43] then i say give it to god brother
[51:46] give your heart to god give your life to
[51:49] god because he can help us
[51:54] but we don't want him to help us
[51:58] who's going to help us if god don't help
[52:00] us
[52:02] the president says you can't find help
[52:04] anywhere else
[52:07] amen you say well if i get this degree
[52:10] if i do this if i do that then i'll be
[52:12] all right no you need god
[52:19] that's the only help that we're going to
[52:21] security our refuge our safe place our
[52:25] security
[52:27] you want to be secured
[52:31] are you with me
[52:33] because you're not secure in any other
[52:35] way your job won't give you security and
[52:38] your money won't give you security
[52:40] amen
[52:43] you're not secured
[52:46] a refuge a place of safety a place where
[52:49] i can feel like i am safe i'm secured
[52:54] only in god
[52:58] and why
[52:59] why see sometimes the devil is just
[53:03] he just got a soul
[53:05] he got us so blinded so twisted up
[53:08] tangled up mixed up
[53:10] that we won't we don't want to hear
[53:13] we don't want to hear that
[53:16] we don't want to i don't wanna i'm not
[53:18] feeling it
[53:19] i i'm not gonna feel it though i don't
[53:22] care what you say i ain't feeling it i
[53:24] won't listen i'm not gonna let him in
[53:27] no no not me
[53:30] it ain't for me
[53:35] we put all kind of shields and all kind
[53:38] of protections all kind of things to
[53:41] stop god's word from penetrating our
[53:44] hearts and take oh god
[53:47] it's god our help comes from the lord
[53:50] but we'll do everything we can do to not
[53:54] we don't want him to help us
[53:56] because i don't believe he
[53:58] he can help me
[54:02] i don't want him
[54:04] to help me
[54:08] we do everything we can do
[54:11] praise god
[54:13] that god not help us
[54:17] you know sometimes we'll turn away from
[54:19] god for the last time
[54:22] and judgment is strike
[54:28] when you can see a young man laying on
[54:29] his bed paralyzed
[54:32] when he's just when you can see somebody
[54:35] that just lost it all
[54:38] and you look at them since they had the
[54:40] opportunity
[54:43] they had the opportunity but they didn't
[54:45] believe it
[54:49] they had the opportunity
[54:51] to go god's way
[54:54] but they didn't believe it
[55:01] let me
[55:02] say this
[55:03] in the next verse
[55:04] it says
[55:07] therefore will not we what
[55:13] therefore
[55:16] will we not fear
[55:21] men's hearts failing
[55:23] because of fear
[55:25] of the things that's coming on the earth
[55:30] therefore
[55:32] we would not fear
[55:34] brother and sister
[55:36] fear is gripping folk
[55:39] they don't know how to deal with the
[55:40] fear
[55:42] the fear of being alone
[55:45] a fear of anybody caring about me
[55:50] a fear of folks don't understand you
[55:55] a fear of losing
[55:57] family members fear of
[56:00] you know people are are so fearful today
[56:05] he said men hearts will fail because of
[56:07] fear
[56:11] and i believe we're living in a fearful
[56:13] time
[56:15] he says god is our refuge and our
[56:17] strength very present help in the time
[56:20] of trouble
[56:21] and he says
[56:23] therefore
[56:24] will
[56:26] therefore will not
[56:28] we fear
[56:31] are you with me
[56:33] but i'm going to tell you something
[56:36] if god is not your refuge you're living
[56:38] in fear
[56:41] you actually living in fear
[56:46] folks are being tormented
[56:48] they can't have peace
[56:53] because there's no future in this world
[57:00] there's nothing that you can look
[57:01] forward to that would relax you that
[57:04] would calm your nerves that would make
[57:06] you feel he meant that everything's
[57:08] going to be all right it doesn't matter
[57:10] how amen a politician says it's gonna be
[57:13] all right it's something not inside you
[57:15] you don't believe that
[57:20] but god will make it all right
[57:24] therefore we would not fear
[57:27] though the earth be removed
[57:31] and though the mountains be carried into
[57:33] the midst of the sea
[57:36] things are happening earthquakes are
[57:37] happening every day
[57:41] things are happening throughout the
[57:43] earth
[57:44] that's causing fear to grip the haunted
[57:46] people
[57:51] they said it's global warming they said
[57:53] it's just that but i'm gonna tell you
[57:55] something
[57:56] because sin has increased
[58:00] because of nicotine abound
[58:04] and you wonder why the love of many
[58:08] hearts are going to whack squat
[58:10] cold people are cold-hearted that's why
[58:12] they can do
[58:13] such heinous crimes because they're
[58:16] cold-hearted
[58:19] because of nicotine about
[58:23] people know to do good and they won't do
[58:25] it
[58:28] know they'll they're doing wrong and
[58:30] they keep doing it
[58:36] i'm gonna tell you something we ain't a

[58:40] anchor our faith in god and trust him

[58:48] midst of the sea and though the waters
[58:49] they'll roar
[58:52] and be troubled
[58:53] though
[58:56] the mountains be shake
[58:59] with the swelling there
[59:01] now he gives us confidence
[59:05] you see the volcano is erupting and this
[59:08] that all of that shaking with the
[59:10] swelling is there
[59:13] he says
[59:14] there is a what
[59:17] there is a river

[59:22] river
[59:23] there's a river of life springing up in
[59:25] me
[59:27] he said he that believeth on me as the
[59:29] scripture said then out of his belly
[59:30] shall flow what
[59:34] rivers of what
[59:36] there is a river
[59:38] i will not leave you comfortless

[1:13:02] and by the word of their testimony
[1:13:06] you can't have a testimony till you've
[1:13:07] been tested
[1:13:11] brother and sister you and i are going
[1:13:13] through testing time
[1:13:16] that we might
[1:13:18] have the testimony that we overcame him
[1:13:22] by the blood of the lamb
[1:13:29] your testimony won't be mine
[1:13:32] you got to have your own individual
[1:13:36] experience with god
[1:13:39] amen for one woman said if i can touch
[1:13:41] the hymn of his garment
[1:13:48] i'ma tell you something that was her
