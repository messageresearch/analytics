[47:22] two and four
[47:28] god is good amen
[47:32] we want to talk about souls in prison
[47:35] [Music]
[47:36] now
[47:38] reason being that we're so in prison
[47:41] because the bible says
[47:44] and adam all died we know
[47:47] eve was the mother of all living
[47:50] but adam amen after the flood
[47:55] you know we see an adam all died
[47:59] because of disobedience
[48:03] but the last adam which is christ in
[48:06] christ
[48:07] all were made alive are you with me
[48:11] so we talk about father's day we look at
[48:14] the
[48:15] first adam and the last adam are you
[48:18] with me
[48:20] souls that are in prison now it says
[48:24] here in ii peter
[48:26] 2 and 4 if god spared not
[48:29] the angels that sinned but cast them
[48:33] down
[48:34] to hell deliver them into chains of
[48:38] darkness
[48:39] to be reserved unto the judgment
[48:42] and spare not the old world but save
[48:46] noah
[48:46] the eighth person a preacher of
[48:49] righteousness bringing in the flood upon
[48:52] the world
[48:52] of the ungodly i'll just read the next
[48:55] verse anyway
[48:56] and turning the cities of sodom and
[48:58] gomorrah into ashes condemned them with
[49:00] the overflow
[49:03] overthrow making them an example until
[49:06] who
[49:07] those that should what
[49:11] afterwards after should live ungodly
[49:16] let's check our lives up because our
[49:19] destiny amen is to determine
[49:23] how we live our lives
[49:27] it'll determine our destination where
[49:29] we're going from here
[49:31] god bless you you may be seated
[49:35] first peter 3 souls that are in prison
[49:39] now
[49:41] the dimensions of blending
[49:44] there's been a blending of dimensions
[49:48] praise god as i said that
[49:52] amen the saints that goes on and be with
[49:55] the lord that are sleeping in christ
[49:58] they go into the sixth dimension which
[50:00] would some would call it uh
[50:02] paradise some would call it an altar
[50:04] different
[50:05] names for it but they when they die they
[50:08] don't go
[50:09] into the seventh dimension where god is
[50:12] amen it's only when
[50:15] they met somebody talks about abraham
[50:17] bosom and different things like that
[50:20] but we realize that there's a place that
[50:23] you it's a waiting place the saints that
[50:26] are sleeping and waiting
[50:28] amen the prophet of god looked and
[50:31] he went out of a body experience and he
[50:34] went into the other dimension
[50:36] amen and he called him you know beyond
[50:39] the curtains of time
[50:42] amen when he goes out of the body and
[50:45] goes into a place that he calls uh
[50:48] sublime and he calls it those that were
[50:51] there he said nothing but perfect love
[50:53] can enter here
[50:55] so if you don't have perfect love you
[50:57] can't go into that dimension that place
[51:01] amen it takes perfect love amen
[51:05] so if you got anything against anybody
[51:08] you ought to forgive them
[51:10] amen because the only perfect love can
[51:12] enter there
[51:14] praise god it's not something we speak
[51:16] of it's something that
[51:17] amen is manifested in our lives amen
[51:20] but we only can have perfect love till
[51:22] we have the one that is perfect
[51:26] amen without him amen you cannot be
[51:29] perfect he said be
[51:30] perfect as your father which is in
[51:32] heaven is perfect
[51:34] amen amen praise god so god
[51:37] amen wants to amen perfect us
[51:40] through his word amen he sent his word
[51:44] and it brings us into
[51:46] a a state of perfection
[51:50] because his word is the incorruptible
[51:52] seed
[51:53] and if you have the seed in you amen oh
[51:56] god
[51:57] he said he that born of god does not
[51:59] commit sin because
[52:00] his seed remaineth in him and he cannot
[52:03] stand
[52:03] because he's born of god amen because of
[52:07] the seed of god
[52:08] because of amen the the very life of god
[52:12] being inside of you amen
[52:16] you're born again not of corruptable but
[52:18] incorruptible seed
[52:20] amen praise god hallelujah thank god for
[52:24] passing from death to life
[52:26] are you with me oh god those that
[52:30] believe
[52:30] past from death to life

[52:44] i got my scriptures going today but 3
[52:47] 18. i hope everybody got their bibles
[52:52] 3 18. it says for christ
[52:56] also has once suffered for sin the just
[52:58] for the unjust
[53:00] that he might bring us to god being put
[53:03] to death
[53:04] in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
[53:10] by which also he went and what
[53:14] preached unto the spirits what and we
[53:18] were saying this
[53:19] souls in prison now
[53:23] the spirits down
[53:29] in prison which sometimes
[53:34] were what 21st was sometime or what
[53:38] disobedient when once the long suffering
[53:41] of god waited
[53:42] in the days of noah while the awkwards
[53:44] are preparing weighing in
[53:45] few that is what
[53:49] eight souls were saved by water
[53:54] i wonder how many souls will be saved
[53:56] now
[53:58] probably god talk about one in a million
[54:02] brother and sister if it's just one in a
[54:03] million that means amen we got to amen
[54:06] if the righteous scarcely be saved
[54:08] what should a sinner and ungodly appear
[54:12] if you're gonna barely make it amen and
[54:15] god has to shorten the days for the
[54:16] election where are we standing
[54:20] brother and sister amen this is not a
[54:22] time just to play church or play around
[54:24] with the soul
[54:26] eternity means something what we go from
[54:29] here
[54:30] should mean something that means we
[54:32] ought to take the
[54:33] give the most earnest heed to the things
[54:35] that we've heard
[54:36] at least at any time we shall let them

[54:43] so greatly salvation
[54:45] the salvation that amen praise god the
[54:47] price has been paid

[54:56] we are not amen uh kind of you know
[55:00] uh you know just just coming to church
[55:03] and
[55:03] just hearing the word and it it's not
[55:06] really resonating
[55:07] it's not really settling down in our
[55:10] spirit
[55:11] it's not really doing anything for us
[55:13] because
[55:14] it's not falling on the right ground
[55:17] rather than it's got to fall on the
[55:19] heart that wants god
[55:23] somebody just said god i need something

[1:07:19] ephesians 2 and 5.
[1:07:22] the bible tells us in ephesians 2 and
[1:07:25] you has a quickened you has been made a
[1:07:27] lie
[1:07:28] amen even
[1:07:33] when you we were dead in
[1:07:36] sin has he what has he made us alive
[1:07:40] as he quickened i mean you got to
[1:07:43] realize where god brought you and i
[1:07:45] from you has he made alive has he
[1:07:48] quickened has he made a lie
[1:07:51] i'm glad that god because he live i live
[1:07:56] amen isn't that right you got a father
[1:07:59] that gave his life for you
[1:08:03] amen that you can live amen
[1:08:07] jesus died that we could live
[1:08:11] praise god and when we die amen
[1:08:15] to ourselves he lives
[1:08:19] praise god souls that are in prison we
[1:08:23] know the nature of the spirit is the
[1:08:24] soul

[1:08:49] he said the soul that sinneth it shall
[1:08:51] what
[1:08:52] die amen all souls are mine
[1:08:56] but the soul that sin is that you die
[1:08:58] isn't that right
[1:09:00] so an adam all died because of sin
[1:09:03] amen so here we are again

[1:09:12] died
[1:09:13] it was the nature of

[1:15:22] you free
[1:15:24] amen oh lord
[1:15:28] souls that are in prison people are
[1:15:31] are living in a i said the the
[1:15:35] the dimensions amen there's been a
[1:15:37] blending of dimensions people are
[1:15:39] actually
[1:15:40] living in a the world has come where
[1:15:43] hell
[1:15:44] lead has been taken off and there's been
[1:15:46] a blending where hell is
[1:15:48] virgin on earth
[1:15:52] the prophet of god was in uh j.c
[1:15:54] pennings and he saw
[1:15:56] what he saw in hell
[1:15:59] and he said to himself am i in hell
[1:16:01] again
[1:16:04] are you with me because when he was
[1:16:07] dying he
[1:16:09] went over there in that dimension and he
[1:16:11] recognized that he was lost and he asked
[1:16:13] god to save him
[1:16:15] because he realized that he was lost
[1:16:17] then
[1:16:19] amen the dimensions amen are blending
[1:16:21] again
[1:16:22] but in jcpenney what he saw in hell he
[1:16:25] saw the women looking like that
[1:16:29] just like what he saw when he was in
[1:16:30] hell when he was in
[1:16:32] that place of dying
[1:16:35] and i'm gonna tell you something amen
[1:16:38] the prophet of god says now
[1:16:40] i want you to understand that we're
[1:16:42] mammal
[1:16:43] the difference between an animal and a
[1:16:45] man
[1:16:46] is we have a soul
[1:16:50] amen and because we have a soul
[1:16:55] amen when god made man he was spirit man
[1:16:58] in genesis one he was spirit man and man
[1:17:01] was in the image of god
[1:17:04] but in genesis 2 he made man of the dust
[1:17:06] of the ground because he had no man to
[1:17:08] tear the soul
[1:17:09] are you with me so here god
[1:17:12] amen looking at man and amen
[1:17:16] and they needed someone to saw so he
[1:17:18] made man
[1:17:19] of the dust of the ground and then he
[1:17:22] blew in his
[1:17:22] nostrils to breath in life and man
[1:17:24] became a what
[1:17:26] a living soul okay okay so man had a
[1:17:30] soul now
[1:17:32] praise god but in the image of god amen
[1:17:35] praise god he wasn't worried about
[1:17:36] nothing
[1:17:38] praise god even with the living soul man
[1:17:40] could walk around
[1:17:42] and had no shame he was naked isn't that
[1:17:45] right
[1:17:46] he didn't need no clothes no other
[1:17:48] animal had clothes and no other animal
[1:17:50] have clothes
[1:17:51] the only animal that has clothes is man
[1:17:55] and what is what are the clothes there
[1:17:57] for to hide their what
[1:17:59] their necking is their shame not now in
[1:18:02] this age
[1:18:06] in this age amen there's been a blending
[1:18:08] of dimensions
[1:18:10] are you with me so people are not shamed
[1:18:14] to walk around naked because why no
[1:18:17] animal
[1:18:20] so men are acting like brute what
[1:18:24] rupees are you up man
[1:18:28] so the man is trying to take on his
[1:18:30] animal like nature
[1:18:32] that they want to be naked amen but
[1:18:35] because they have a soul
[1:18:36] that should be shamed amen
[1:18:40] but because a man should be shamed but
[1:18:43] he's not ashamed
[1:18:45] to be naked because
[1:18:48] in the layout of the series they'll be
[1:18:50] blind naked wretched
[1:18:51] poor miserable and they wouldn't even
[1:18:54] know they're naked
[1:18:56] they're blind and don't even know
[1:18:58] they're blind
[1:19:00] amen this is the most deceptive age amen
[1:19:03] praise god people are so blind till they
[1:19:06] have come to church
[1:19:07] and they're set up and they're naked and
[1:19:10] the preacher
[1:19:11] scared to say something about it
[1:19:14] are you with me praise god
[1:19:18] they're trying to sit down with what
[1:19:20] they got on and trying to pull it
[1:19:22] now amen there is nothing but a fig leaf
[1:19:27] amen but when god the holy ghost come in
[1:19:30] the place
[1:19:31] of god ever come in praise god it'll
[1:19:35] bring about ashamedness and they'll try
[1:19:37] to hide
[1:19:38] praise god to people amen they're just
[1:19:41] not hearing the word lock the heart
[1:19:44] praise god but if god presence and god
[1:19:46] anoint and come in it'll change
[1:19:49] folks out loud praise god it'll change
[1:19:52] what they praise god people will be
[1:19:55] ashamed to come in the house of the lord
[1:19:58] for in his presence amen praise god
[1:20:03] it's something about you bringing the
[1:20:05] presence of god in the house
[1:20:08] amen it's something about you bringing
[1:20:09] the anointing of god inside of you
[1:20:14] folks can walk in your presence and not
[1:20:16] feel condemned
[1:20:19] praise god you're talking about walking
[1:20:20] in the church and not feeling condemned
[1:20:22] we're walking in your presence they
[1:20:24] should know that the presence of god is
[1:20:26] in you
[1:20:28] the anointing of god is in you
[1:20:31] you don't have to tell them that
[1:20:34] praise god is something about the
[1:20:36] presence of god
[1:20:38] praise god the people feel condemned
[1:20:41] praise god then what happens when a
[1:20:44] person is
[1:20:45] running from the presence of god then
[1:20:47] they run from you
[1:20:49] run from your presence they'll avoid you
[1:20:52] because
[1:20:53] there's something inside of you condemn
[1:20:55] them

[1:21:28] the reason why folks are condemned
[1:21:30] because they're not in him
[1:21:33] they just imagine they are they presume
[1:21:36] they venture without authority they
[1:21:38] think they are

[1:22:57] message
[1:22:59] not because you say brother simmons i go
[1:23:00] to broad tabernacle
[1:23:03] not because you said amen it's because
[1:23:07] god testifies of himself
[1:23:12] praise god you love the truth
[1:23:15] amen amen but if you love a lie
[1:23:22] amen if you don't love the truth god can
[1:23:24] give you a strong delusion

[1:24:40] seek those things what y'all what where
[1:24:44] christ said it's on the right hand of

[1:24:48] on things above and not on the things
[1:24:50] that what
[1:24:52] i'm gonna tell you there's so many doors
[1:24:54] open in the spirit realm
[1:24:56] and and so many doors open in the
[1:24:58] natural realm
[1:24:59] that a lot of times i could just see
[1:25:01] amen the devil offered you if you want
[1:25:04] to become an instant millionaire here it
[1:25:06] is
[1:25:07] and i can say oh lord bye
[1:25:14] then sometimes you say show me whether
[1:25:17] you can be an instant millionaire

[1:26:18] but god will give it to you
[1:26:21] if you just wait on god and let god work

[1:30:53] and those souls that are in prison look
[1:30:54] at the world
[1:30:57] amen as the lids have been taken out for
[1:30:59] hell
[1:31:00] then we see the demons that has
[1:31:04] has pressed themselves into human beings
[1:31:07] and they're tattooing and cutting
[1:31:09] themselves putting all kind of images
[1:31:11] all over their self
[1:31:12] and not a shame i said what makes a
[1:31:16] a woman would put all kind of images
[1:31:19] writing all over her
[1:31:20] and then uh men uh they're so tracked up
[1:31:24] and
[1:31:25] the bible talked about don't put
[1:31:27] comments on you
[1:31:29] and images but people are
[1:31:32] going to get a tattoo because demons are
[1:31:35] driving them into those
[1:31:36] tattooed houses when you when you pass a
[1:31:40] tattoo house you look
[1:31:41] it's almost demons spirits settling
[1:31:44] there
[1:31:45] and inviting those that are uh uh are
[1:31:48] blind and naked
[1:31:49] come on and get a tattoo
[1:31:52] amen and they get in there they tell
[1:31:54] when they get one of jesus
[1:31:56] getting one of the cross and getting one
[1:31:58] of oh god

[1:32:02] not wash
[1:32:04] graven images isn't that right and
[1:32:06] they're getting engraving images on them
[1:32:09] isn't that right so we're going into a
[1:32:12] place where hell
[1:32:13] lead souls that are in prison now
[1:32:16] people walk around then they lost it
[1:32:21] the last message in the days of noah

[1:32:59] around dead
[1:33:02] praise god without god they can hear the
[1:33:06] word but they can't cross back
[1:33:09] because the rich man heard and saw
[1:33:12] ladders but he couldn't cross back over
[1:33:15] they heard noah preaching but they could
[1:33:17] not cross back over
[1:33:20] praise god when the reigns came and the
