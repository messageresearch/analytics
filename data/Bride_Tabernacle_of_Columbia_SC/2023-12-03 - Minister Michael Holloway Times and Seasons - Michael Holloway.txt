another Lord a hand clap if you would hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen I bring greetings in the name of our Lord Savior Jesus Christ and also from my home church back home only believe Tabernacle I think the last time I was here our pastor had the privilege of speak in a Sunday evening service with you and uh certainly enjoy being here that day and uh pray the Lord to bless our service here this morning if you have your Bibles I'm going invite you to turn me the book of Ecclesiastes the third chapter Ecclesiastes the third chapter we're just going to read one verse and I'll try not to be too long this morning a little bit different Ministry than your pastor so uh I'm not here to hear him preach so I don't know how long he preached but I got a feeling from knowing him it's probably not not very long but um and I don't typically preach very long either but but it might be just a little bit longer than you accustomed to so if it is just bear with me Ecclesiastes chapter 3:1 and before we read let's bow for a word of prayer dear heavenly father Lord I Want to Thank You for Your Grace this morning thank you for all that you've done for us Lord thank you for the Amazing Grace Lord not only to save us Lord but to your longsuffering to bear with us oh God as you work with us and work on us to get out of us what you created us for and Lord I believe we're coming to that hour Lord that you're looking down oh God and you're seeing a bride come to maturity oh God and it's a thing that you long for Lord since the foundation of the world lord it's right here at hand God help us this morning Lord to see our place in it just open our eyes by your grace we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Ecclesiastes chapter 3 just one verse to everything there is a season I really want us to catch that to everything thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven let's B our heads again dear Lord I want to thank you for the reading of your word Lord that's all we can do as a man I ask sincerely Lord you help us to step aside you know the people that are standing before me Lord I don't you know the need a very Heart Lord I pray that you address them Lord so I commit the gift in your hands we ask it in Jesus Christ's name May the church say amen amen you may be seated I want to take for a title this morning take for a title times and Seasons times and Seasons being humans we're creatures of time you know we were born in time each one of us if we have a birth certificate there's a date on it there's usually a Time that you were born it seems like everything we do in this world is managed by time as more as mortal beings we manage our days and our life by time and we understand many things in our life by time that doesn't make us sinful that just means that we're human but as morals we tend to plan all of activities around time church starts at a certain time church starts on a certain date we worry about when things are going to start and we get there we're about how long is it going to last this it going to be a short service this going to be a long service everything we do seems to be effective by time but if we look back at the scripture that Solomon is talking about here he's not talking about time just in the sense of Quantified hours and minutes and days he's talking about time in a little bit different context a little bit deeper thought and he's talking about it in terms of the purpose of how things relate in the junction of time and when they happen in time and that it don't just happen by chance these things happen at a certainty at a certain time by God's timing if you go back to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 again verse one I want you to notice here he says to everything there is a season and I want you to get this and a time so there's a season and then there Comes A Time listen now in that season we're going to get with that in a minute to every purpose under heaven so everything that's happening in these seasons and at certain times there's a purpose behind it now watch what he say these things and events are Salon refers to them as purpose and Solomon is about to give us some examples of what he calls seasons and what he refers to as purpose he said there's a time to be born Birth has a Time listen now birth serves a purpose God told Noah go forth and replenish the Earth the way he did it was what mankind has to give birth we're not in this time frame to live here forever if nobody gave birth guess what the human race would cease to exist so even in birth listen there's a time for it and there is a purpose for it are you follow me now I want you to watch this so there's a season for time and in time and there's a season for things to be be born if you look at where we are right now we in we're in winter but when you talk about Springtime what is that Springtime is a time for things to come forth the trees begin to give life and and the Animals begin to reproduce are you follow me what is it there's a certain season and that season is when things begin to give life it's a time of birth are you follow me so even Birth has a season and it serves a purpose but I want you to watch this spring is the season to bring new life but there's also also according to Solomon there's a time to what time to die we're in a season right now where there's certain things now that are dying what if you look at your flower beds if you women that have flower beds in your yard guess what there's probably not a whole lot of flowers in it right now and if there's is there's not much life left to it why it's a season and in this season we expect what to take place certain things to what die it's a season for it couple of months ago I got stung up in my yard doing some yard work by some yellow jackets in the ground that I didn't know were there I count felt sorry for the fellas when when they stung me I made up my mind that day I said I'm going to get rid of these guys and I went they pour me some G gas in the cup and I was going to finish him off and I felt little convient aside said you know what don't pour the gas on them I said they they were just protecting their nest I didn't know they were there if I didn't know they were there I'd went around them so I didn't kill him but guess what I said come the winter time there's a season brother Simmons I ain't got lay hand on them but in winter time because the season guess what they can't handle the cold so it's a time for them to what die but in the springtime The Nest that they got on their own guess what there'll be new life come up again are you f me there's a time and season for everything is the point I'm trying to make to you so winter is a time when we begin to see death come forth because there's a season where death serves a purpose when our Lord came to Earth as wonderful as that life was there was a season he had preached the gospel he had healed the sick he had confirmed the word but there came a season what was that season it was time for him to what die so even death serves a purpose he didn't die in vain he died that you and I might have life are you follow me so there's a certain purpose for everything and if you look at St John chapter 12 there was a great purpose in his death it says verse 24 verily verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth what much fruit so his death was not in vain there was a season for it and there was a purpose for it that you and I might be here today we're the fruit of that death I want you to watch this now not only did he die death serve a spiritual purpose but our death listen now serves a purpose as well if you look at Romans chap 6:3 it says know ye not that so many of us that were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so also we should walk in the newness of Life by his death came a birth and by our death comes a new birth are you following me there's a season for these things and there's a purpose for these things now we might not always understand what God is doing but I'm just trying to give you some samples or some examples to go by as I begin to to build a platform we might not always understand God's season and God's purpose but I'm hoping this morning that this message will help us to understand a little bit better the season you in right now but every action under Heaven Solomon says has a purpose now let's not limit this thought to our purpose because the scripture is not emphasizing our purpose if you read it carefully Solomon is emphasizing God's purpose if you look at Ecclesiastes chap 3:1 I want to read that to you because I want you to understand we talking purpose I'm not talking about our purpose I'm not talking about your purpose I'm talking about God's purpose if you look at chapter 3: 11 Solomon says he has made everything beautiful in listen his time so this season and his times and his purpose is not our season it's not our time it's his season and his time and it's also his purpose cuz Paul said ye are called according to his purpose not your purpose I want us to get there now watch this notice the next word in his time he had made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart that's speaking of you and I that's mankind he set the world in our heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end so even though he has a time and he has a season and he has a purpose he so arranged this thing Solomon said that you and I will never figure out what his time is you'll never figure out what his purpose is but the only way to know brother Simmons is by his grace he's got to reveal it to you because we'll never by our human thinking figur out his time his season or his purpose but now watch this I want to get into his purpose this morning so every work that is to serve his purpose but his true purpose is a mystery to mankind although we listen play a part in it Although our natural ease will see our eyes will see it as it's coming in the pass I walked in this morning I appreciate hearing your pastor as he was dealing with the Sunday school and he was trying to tie in as he Springs me the back Daniel 70 weeks and some things that the prophet said and this morning I heard him come I came in I heard him talk about Israel and what was happening over there right now in this war do you realize this is in scripture what's taking place over there is not just the world looks at as a national event how can we have peace talks this is not about peace talks there'll be no peace until shallow come what we're seeing is scripturally fulfilled but guess what it's a season that Israel's got to enter this battle because why it's the season for it and it was in the scripture foret told that it was coming now watch this we can see what's happening a lot of times but can we really discern what we're looking at I want to take my time we can see it but can we discern really what we're looking at look at Ecclesiastes again verse chapter 3 verse 11 and he has set the world in their heart speaking of man so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end God has so arranged a thing that man cannot figure out what he is doing yet God has foretold every major event in time that he has predestinated for man and he placed it listen right here in the word so what God is doing is not something that's so much hidden in the corner he's placed it in plain sight in his word but it will take the Holy Spirit to anoint your eyes it'll take the Holy Spirit to anoint my eyes to recognize what's in the world in the word and then look at the world around us and be able to place what we're seeing right back in the word and then when you can see it by the word then and only then can you really recognize what God is doing people can try to surmise what they think he's doing they can try to pontificate on what he's doing but they'll never really know what he's doing until God himself takes it back and reveals it by the word now I want you to watch this so he placed it here in the word and all we got to do is ask for for God to open our eyes to show us the time that we're living in let me show what I mean by this many young kids recognize the days of Noah what was that season you'll ask them oh that's when the flood came and everything died the little child could tell you that it was a season of death now listen to me now the little church could tell you that from Sunday school you can ask some same little kids what about Moses oh Moses was the deliverer they can recognize there was a time that the prophet told us a nation was being born out of a Nation it was a time of birth but they might not looked at his birth but when they came out God said that was my son God saw his son not just the people his son being born out of a Nation or you follow me it was a time to be born but yet when little kids look at the Bible they can tell you the story but they can't understand what God was doing but that was for another age you and I don't want to just know what God did in that age the same way there was a purpose in what he was doing there right now where you're sitting and living there's a purpose to what God is doing now let me go a little further when they came out of Egypt it was a season of time to be born because why everything that was happening at that time listen was pre-planned God told Abraham 400 and something years before they came out of that Nation he said this is what I'm going to do and he revealed them by his word to Abraham and yet they knew by the word certain events was supposed to happen but when they were happening they didn't recognize them and they thought Moses came as a troublemaker but Moses was not a troublemaker he was actually the man God was using to fulfill his word but to the people he was a troublemaker and when John the Baptist came it was a season but what did the church think they thought he was a troublemaker he was not a troublemaker he was the man God was using to fulfill the word in this season and in our age there something happening God is is not stiring trouble to be stiring trouble but what is it doing bringing a division because this is the age where the righteous and unrighteous is going to be divided let me keep going let me keep going everything that's happening listen now is pre-planned get that now just like those ages were pre-planned this age you're living in Sister it was pre-planned and I want you to understand something you were pre-planned with it Moses didn't show up by chance he was planned to be there Israel wasn't a nation by chance God planned it to be there John didn't have them a chance God planned them to be there the Pharisees weren't there by chance God planned them to be there but Jesus said if you only recognized your season you wouldn't act the way you were acting are you follow me but those that recognized it were blessed when they recognize their season what are you get the holway I want you to recognize your season I want you to be a part of that blessed group that recognize your season now watch this all things were pre-planned they were clearly foretold by God but yet there were a mystery in his promised word he said when there would be and he said what would happen when the season came and he said what the Believers would do when that time came so there is a time and a season for everything and there was a time and a season for me to be born and there's a purpose for Michael Hollow to be born and not just be born but there's a purpose for Michael Hollow to be born at this time remember now not my purpose to be born his purpose for me to be born you understand now watch this God had a spiritual purpose in my birth and so did he have one in yours those little girls sitting in front of me they might have a mom and daddy in this church church right now they're here cuz they're here with parents but there's a purpose in them sitting there you said brother H explain it to me I can't brother Simmons might not be able to explain it but listen there's a purpose in them being there now watch this brother Brown said this in a message things ought to be he said you were all pre-planned by God put yourself in that you are all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance they're not didn't here by chance you say they here because their mama's here that might be our thinking but God might be thinking something different one of them two ladies might be the Lexi that's about to have a body change and God wanted to put them under the opice of the word that they might hear something that could literally change their bodies they're not hanging out with Mama they're here for a purpose listen nothing happens by chance with God he know it all about it it's all pre-planned plann before many generations back so that you could be here tonight you're here right now because God pre-planned it you're not in this church by accident I'm not in my home Church by accident we come to places of Fellowship because you might think I'm here because of so and so I'm here because of it is but brother Brown said no sir if you're a seed of God God pre-planned it watch this he said did you know that the congregation amen this mystery of his time and season was purpose by him and God has hid those things in the word but he has also revealed them in types and shadows in nature let's go back to Solomon again let's go back to Ecclesiastes 3 I'm laying a foundation because I want you to understand something there's times and there's seasons and there's relevance to times and seasons and if you don't know your time and season you can be walking right past something and don't even realize what you're walking right past but if you can recognize your time and season listen you begin to look for things you know I got these flowers that come my yard but every year I didn't plant those flowers when I bought my house 20 years ago the people that owned my house before I got there they knew a whole lot more about Garden than I do because they that was a pretty pretty landscape when I bought it ain't as pretty as it used to be CU I don't know how to keep it like they kept it but 20 years later brother Simmons it's still producing why cuz they knew what they were doing but I understand certain Seasons now because when certain times come around certain things in my yard begin to bloom and when the season changes I begin to expect it because I know the season and I know the potential of what them people 20 years ago planted in my yard if you can understand what God planted before the foundation of the world and recognize your season you begin to expect certain things because it's the season listen Ecclesiastes 2 a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and the time to pluck up that which is planted now listen this is nature Solomon is looking looking at and God hides himself listen in nature watch what the prophet said about nature God accepted his provider we're at the end time let me take something in nature because nature listen what he says was my first Bible not the King James nature nature was my first Bible I know God is a Creator and he created nature and he lives in his Creation in nature natur the prophet said my first Bible was nature and the reason it was a Bible because nature can reveal God you said brother holl where you get that from look at what Paul said you believe Paul's writing let's go to Romans chapter 1 watch what Paul said in Romans 1 Romans 1:18 Paul says for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all unrighteous ungodliness of men who hold a truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifest best King James says in them but the right translation is to them God has showed it to them when I watch how God showed it to him for the invisible things of him that's God from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by things that are made that's his creation if you want to understand God Paul is saying you can see him in his creation if you know what you're looking at do you understand so the prophet said he didn't first see God in the Bible he first saw in his creation and Paul said even a mystery of the godhead can be understood by simply looking at nature now I want to show you if you want of those little times of season learn nature cuz all of nature that we know about is governed by what times and Seasons now watch this watch this even God's deepest Mysteries can be understood by nature and we can begin to understand his purpose in it if you look at brother Bram said the message the Harvest time he said now that's how we find God sometime listen is to look into nature now the reason I'm taking my time and showing you Paul I'm taking my time and show what this Prophet said is because I'm going to talk a little bit today a lot today about nature and I want you to understand why I'm focused on nature because the prophet said it and Paul said it sometimes if you want to know God's Mysteries both prophets pointed us Back To Nature brother B said now that's how we find God sometime is to look in nature seasons rotating around proves God that's where I first found it now these prophets use nature look at John the Baptist Matthew chap 3:9 when John was preaching his message John used nature to reveal the Revelation that he had watch how John did it St Matthew chapter 3:9 and think not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children PR what did he do he's now pointing Back To Nature watch this and now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees wherefore every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is hooed down and cast where Into the Fire what is he doing he's preaching a message and you might just say it's a parable but it's more than a parable he had a revelation and to help them understand that where did he take him back to brother he took him back brother Gordon to Nature now watch this John was preaching the revelation of yah but he did it using nature now I want you to look at Jesus Jesus preached his message and what did he use nature look at St John chap 15 verse 5 he says I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit but without me listen ye can do nothing now he's talking about Vines and branches I want to know about the word brother Simmons I don't want to know about Vines and branches but what he was doing he was using Vines and branches to reveal the word what was he preaching the mystery of Pentecost and that was the promise of that age but how was he revealing it through nature now watch this Jesus used nature to reveal Pentecost look at Acts chapter 1 and watch the Fulfillment of what he's talking about acts chap 1 verse4 and being assembled together with them commanding them they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which you said ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you should be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence you can't do nothing without me you stay here till you get the Holy Ghost cuz it's the life of the vine that's got to work through the branches he was preaching a Pentecost but to the carnal mind they say oh he's talking about nature he ain't talking about nature he was revealing the hour by the nature that he was living or seeing that's what I'm getting I want to take you into nature this morning but I want to show you brother Hollow ain't some limb bringing some crazy typology the prophets use nature John use nature Solomon preach nature Jesus preached nature and our own Prophet preached nature I want to deal with nature CU I want you to see your time in your season you see we can coast along and say I'm in the message and and mean that I'm not talking about hypocrites sincere hearted people my brother believe it but you're in the message the message came in a certain season but now what time are you in that season you understand me you can say I'm in the summertime what as the beginning of summertime and then there's the fading out of summertime where are you in summertime do you understand I want to know that I'm in the message but I want to see my season cuz if I know my season then I know what to expect listen in that season because you could be in the season and be looking for the wrong thing let's look at the scriptures and the types of Nature and see our season let me go a little further you see God is in his message and he's using nature to express it so our Prophet did the same thing he used nature to bring out certain things even our time and our season and the age in which we living and what God has doing right now in that age if you look at the message trying to do God of service without being his will brother BR says even nature itself tells us today as we see the Nations breaking the Earth sinking in the handwriting is on the wall how do you know it brother Adam looking at the Nations I'm looking at the Nations but then I take National events Back To Nature well what's happening how does National events have anything to do with nature the Bible said there's a time to be born what did Brother Brown say National events was revealing he said as I begin to see these nations rise up and I begin these wars rising up he said what is it he said this world is going through a birth pain he said the first world war he said was a birth pain he said the second world war was a birth pain and when he began to see the tension rise up he said what is it leading to he said it's leading us to another world war he said to the final birth plane before A New Earth comes forth he saw the birth of a new Earth what is that birth it's called the Millennium this Kingdom won't be about ruled by man it'll be ruled by Jesus Christ but before that kingdom comes in and gives birth there's got to be a bride that leaves here before a millennium sets in so he's looking at natural event headlines and he's taking it back to Nature because before that birth comes forth somebody else has got to go now watch this cuz when he comes back to give the New Kingdom guess who comes back with him so we got to go before he comes back so when he comes back we could be with him when he comes now watch this he was looking at world events by nature and he could recognize this world was falling apart and he recognized that in order for the New Kingdom to come in that this Old Kingdom has to die away he was revealing Nature by prophecy now watch the rest of this statement even nature itself tells us today that we see Nations breaking the Earth is sinking in the handwriting is on the wall we see the church and the state it's in we see the bride listen and the state she's in this is what I want to deal with the state that the church is in and the state that the bride is in watch this and We Know by Nature look at what he looking at that the church is getting ready to leave here if you can see the condition the church is in and if you can see the condition the bride is in then you know what happens in that season and it changes your expectation and what did it do for the prophet when he could place those things by nature and by the word he said I see something the bride is getting ready to leave here let me keep going what a glorious time it's a time that all the prophets have longed to see now watch this why could he be so sure the church was leaving but because the final birth pain which was World War I he could see that that war was at the door and according to scripture this bride was going to be going before it happens now watch this how did he know God's church was getting ready to leave the Earth he saw it in nature and nature themed up with the written word of God so the prophet could see the coming of the Lord by watching nature and scripture look at St Luke 21: 29 and he spake to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees now what is he doing he's going back where nature now I'm going to take my time on this little part here what does he using nature to do he's using nature to show the coming of the Lord where did he get that idea from Jesus used nature to show his coming are you following me now watch this and he spake to them a parable Behold a fig tree and all the other trees and when they shoot forth listen ye know of your own self that summer is not at hand so Jesus saying when you see certain things take place it's a sign you're in a changing season and when the season is coming you should know what happens next in that season now watch this so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is what not at hand if you can see the season and you can see the signs you know what's happening next now whates watch what he's doing this Prophet I'm speaking of he's revealing prophecy by using nature to reveal what God had hidden inside his heart Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 24 another Parable put he forth saying unto them the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man which sold good seed in the field but while men slept his enemy came in and S tears using nature Amongst the Wheat and went his way and when he Blaze was sprung up he brought forth fruit then appeared tears also so the servant of the household came and said unto him s did thou not sow good seed in thy field from whence has it tears and he said unto them the enemy has done this the servant said unto him will thou that we go and gather them up but he said nay least while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let them both grow together listen until the Harvest brother Hol what are you talking about I'm talking about the Rapture Christ is using Parables of nature to hide the mystery of his coming now to some people people had to bypass that and say oh it's a parable oh it's nature you're bypassing the very thing that God hid himself in but for the elect they see it and recognize the season now watch this he's talking about the Rapture and he's hiding the mystery in nature and in the time of the Harvest watch what he says I will say to the Reapers gather you together first the tears and bind the bundles for them to be and bind the the bundles to burn but gather you the weed in the BN what is he saying at the time of the Rapture there's going to be a separate ation there's going to be two Gatherings first is going to gather the bundles of the of of the tears then the weed is gathered to the barn brother man said what was that first Gathering it was the World Council of churches coming together but as they came together he said what was to happen next the bride was to get ready to get out of here and we've already seen the Gathering of the World Council what season over here the bride should be expecting it's time to get out of here but we we getting comfortable in churches I'm not speaking of this church I'm talking around the message that ho my church we get comfortable with church we think that next Sunday we'll be here for the next service we think that next year we'll be here for the next New Year's everything is always time time look into the future but there's going to come a time when time ceases and God takes her home but for those that recognize the season they were looking for it cuz they're recognize their season when it came time for Jesus to go to Calvary did it take him by surprise he saw a season when Paul was going home did he take him by surprise he saw a season when the flood came to take Noah by surprise he start a season are you follow me these people knew how to recognize their season and what God was about to do how much more the elect bride of Jesus Christ she's gone beyond just church she knows that there's a season she was born in and there was a purpose for That season and she's looking for her life listen to manifest that purpose that God put her here for in this season let me go a little bit further so Jesus Christ was preaching the the mystery of his coming by dealing with the the the the the the parable of the wheat and the wheat being gathered was speaking of the Harvest Time and the Harvest Time speaks of the Rapture which is the time listen I'm going to get ahead of myself which is the time you and I are in now now we're not in the time where the seed was sewn seed sewing is over you're in the time that the wheat is now about to be gathered into the barn we're late in the stage we're late in the game and I want to make sure if I'm in that season where the reach spot to go home I want to make sure I'm weat ready to go home now watch this one group be taken another group is going to be left because that's the season we in because God uses his Harvest to represent the Rapture let me go a little bit further James chapter 5: 7 how many still with me I'm only using nature to show your season and I'm STI I'm trying my best to stick with scripture and stick with the message to show you that we're supposed to by the scripture and by Nature see God watch the James says James chapter 5 I'm going to give you another apost James 5:7 be patient therefore Brethren unto the what come to the Lord back to the Rapture again notice a parallel behold the husband man waiteth for the precious what we Back To Nature again when you start talking about raptures when you start talking about this mystery of his coming there's something about nature that God says if you'll just catch it it's your coming it's my coming it's your going home and it's right there in front of you in nature watch this Behold a husband man waited for the precious fruit of the earth he has long patience for it listen until he receive the early and the latter rain be patient and establish your hearts listen this is what I want to get to this is my message brother BR taught on this establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draw nigh he didn't say brother get saved he said establish your hearts to the believer who's looking is now time to if you ever was a time you turn your head to Christ listen this is that time if there was every time you sought the Lord to understand what he's doing and who you are and why you here this is that time it's time for us to turn our attention not part of the world world not part of Christ but it's time for the real believer to turn his heart holy to what the thing that's drawing him because body life has one thing to draw it is not the water it's not the dirt what draws the body life the sun my wife is not a farm over she'll tell you from growing little plants in her house if you take a plant and sit in the corner it could be leaning to the right but if the sun rises on the left that PL in a day or two or do what it'll turn completely around why cuz the sun draws the life and if you got life in you the sun right now is drawing on that life pulling you to himself now watch this they talking about Harvest Time so the prophet saw the time in which we was living in and he compared it with two things the prophet saw it in the word but he also saw it in nature now watch what it says in the Masterpiece because I want you this now this is where I'm going to turn the corner a little bit Watch what it says his Masterpiece notice it started out as the original this is Pentecost as Jesus said the word of God is a seed that the SE sow and he was the so and the seed was the word now I want you to watch this this is where many theologians miss it the seed was the word and notice any seed that abides alone never does nothing it's got to fall into the ground to bring forth its productive again so now Christ is telling us that no seed that abides alone if you take that seed and you put it up here on this pull pit and I don't care how much sunlight you or how much light you have shine on it it'll never produce a plant why it needs to go into the ground it's got to get into the ground where the dirt actually breaks down the outside around it and then the life that's hidden that seed has a chance to grow and establish roots and it can't do it on the pull pit it's got to die and go into the ground to do it now watch this and the seed that perfect Church fell into the ground at n Rome now watch this whenever Jesus Christ said except the corn of wheat falling to the ground it abideth alone every Theologian brother Simons appointed that to Jesus Christ and guess what he was the seed and he did go into a ground but it took a message to tell us that the scripture has a calm pound meaning many times when God speaks a word it doesn't speak to just one generation that same scripture can guess what apply to more than one generation but it takes a prophet to bring out how to apply that seed to your generation it's not for me to figure out what God had in his mind or what his purpose was but it was right there in the scripture but it took a prophet to tell us what did that scripture really mean to the church Christ went to the ground but he said also the church had to go into the ground why she was the seed of Christ manifested in that first age now let me go a little further watch this the church became the seed and just as Jesus had to go on the ground and die so did the crop at Pentecost watch what Jesus said in St John 16:7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for me that I go away for if I go not away the coving will not come unto you but if I depart I will send them unto you what is he saying I've got to die and go into the ground listen that life can come forth again I've got to die and going into the ground that the Holy Ghost that's in me can come forth again so when the church listen of that early age died and went to the ground why did it go into the ground brother Gordon so life could come forth listen again brother Bram said cuz every seed has to go on the ground to bring back another production of itself so what kind of church is God looking for in his last days in this season if the seed went in the ground in the Dark Ages when it came forth he wasn't coming for a tassel he wasn't coming for a stalk he wasn't coming for pollen what was he coming for it's got to come back to the original production cuz that's what God's looking for you've got to see what he's doing by nature and if you see that Original Seed brother Simmons you know you're looking the time is at hand do you understand let me go a little further he had to die but so did this church have to die if she became the seed and I don't have time to go into it but but Jesus Christ taught in Matthew Chapter 13 if you want to go back and read it that the church will become the seed she's called the seed of God or the children of God's Kingdom right there in this Parable You and I by the word become the seed but that church seed had to die now watch this and in her appointed season she had to die and the theologians missed that prophecy but watch what the prophet said in the message Masterpiece you know I read a book here not long ago sometime wrote a book said the silent God you might have read it he said I forgot where I got it he said he said but I I got a copy of it back there on my shelf he said the silent God God through thousands of Dark Ages listen set still and never moved a hand he watched faithful mortars go to the Lion's pit and burnt and and the burnt by the Romans assassinated of all kinds women dipped in their clothes listen set on fire their long hair and with tar and burn remember short hair first began at Rome and the women of Christians had long hair so they dipped their hair in tar and set them on fire and burned them and they were and then they stripped them naked and fed them to the Lions and this writer goes on to say where is that God he says oh the blindness of man sometimes do you not know that that seed had to die when the church went through the persecutions most people that know church history know that millions of Christians were mortared but do you realize there was a purpose for that death there's a time and season for everything and a purpose purpose and a time for every purpose under Heaven There is a time to that church had come to its time where it had to die oh brother holay but that was for Jesus a prophet brought out and said that was also for the church let me go a little further he never tried to deliver them speaking of God they went down in Victory they went down bleeding and dying giving their lives why it was a seed it had to fall into the ground as 1 John 12 tells us a corn of wheat if it got to fall into the ground and there die and not only die but rot but little did the denomination know that that life was still there though the church itself died listen God they couldn't take the Holy Ghost life out of the earth they killed the bodies of the people just like they killed Christ body at Calvary but did they kill the life no the life was still there and what it do it came back at Pentecost and when they killed those real Pentecost Believers in the Dark Ages did they sto the life no it came right back in marttin Luther and what did it say it said God still here and the just shall live by faith nature was showing you can destroy the the shell but you could not destroy the life but what was God showing he was showing nature now the plan came forth said but what was it he said that little stalk that came up by Mont Luther screaming a Jud should live by faith he said that's not the fullness of what Paul preached it was part of his message but it wasn't all of his message but God couldn't come for a bride church until the same seed that went the ground no Farmer harvest when he sees a stock the farmer can't Harvest until he sees the seed again so there was no Rapture going to happen his age cuz it wasn't the season but yet it was the life of God so brother don't put him down cuz that was true Holy Ghost life it was just in a carrier stage carriers change seeds never change the same seed that goes in the ground is the same seed you get at Harvest but the plant changes it's just a carrier on the way back to the original Crop you see what I'm getting at then the next thing after Luther was Wesley they got brother said oh you had Baptist shoots you had Presbyterian shoots you had Lutheran shoots he said but when Wesley came he said now we're back to tsel that's what pollen is pollen can move where the other plant part of Plant can't move pollen can be blown by the wind that was the missionary age he said but that still wasn't seed so then came the Pentecostals now listen what happens in the Pentecostal age he said now you got well looks like seed coming back on the plant he said but it wasn't real seed what was it it was shook it was something that looked almost like seed but it didn't have the same life or the same strength that that first seed had because it wasn't a seed it was only a coding that was to protect the seed and where did our messenger come from where did he preach many of those sermons that you and I listen to where did they come from they came out of Pentecostal churches out of a Pentecostal age where that Prophet was saying as a p Pentecostal messenger sewing the seed for the last day and where was it growing right there in the Pentecostal reals but when the fool word came listen it wasn't just part of the truth but when God opened those Seven Seals what was he doing he was taking the church back to the fullness of the word we had a messenger that preached the same thing that Paul preached what was it doing bringing a bride back to full seed and it said what happened when that seed opened up the Pentecost was pulled away why it was shook are you following me it wasn't attached to the seed it was just carrier life but it pulled back and exposed the seed well brother Holloway where does that put us brother BR said now with the open word we're back to the seed age man this what I want to get you to when the seed was revealed brother Brown said but this is the deal it was green did you know that it was green you don't Harvest Green Seed it might me do it might rot you don't Harvest Green Seed watch what this Prophet said bear with me for a minute watch what he said in Christ revealing his own word the thing that do was to matter with this message now watch this today is those who obtain an in their hearts now remember what James said establish your what Hearts those that obtained in their hearts must lay in the presence of the son to get ripened you see we're not in seeds to an age anymore are you following me we're in ripening stage not a time to be am I sure I'm in the church am I sure I'm saved am I sure I believe his message am I sure brother Sim is my pastor yes see we got to move past being shaken tossed to and fro we're at a stage now where God is getting the real Believers ready by ripening them you know I watched a little video because I want to understand by Nature I said I know I'm teaching nature I said I know what the prophet said I read a little bit I want to see some more about real wheat razors real wheat Farmers so I went and watch one video on wheat farming just to get a little bit more understanding about wheat he said in weed farm and he said when it's in this green stage he said it looks like seed it's not the Chuck no more it's actually real seed he said but if you pluck that seed off the plant and squeeze it brother Simmons you know what you get you get a little milk come out it's a little milk come out you can't do nothing with a seed full of milk he said but if you let it stay in the field a little bit longer you see that Prophet brought back the seed but why didn't the Rapture come God had to leave you and I here a little bit longer why the seed had to ripen yes we got the word the seed is here but the seed has got to ripen he said leave it to feel a little bit longer he said what is it doing he said the more the sun bakes on it the more the sun bakes on it he said that little milk on inside begins to firm up and get harder and get more dense and get harder and what does it do it gets heavier and when it does that what happens that weed begins to bow it begins to bow it be what brother Brown said what does it doing is humbling itself before the sun that's calling it and and it's changing from Green it's literally changing on the outside Brother s you can see the change on the inside manifested on the outside this bride's got to have such a life such a character such a personality of Christ she ain't just changed out here but you can see it on the outside she's more humble and she ain't green no more she's turning golden brown do you understand you can identify her now now her character is showing it why she's laying in the presence of the son and is calling her home she knows what season she's in the heavier she gets the more dense that that seed on the inside grows gets harder and harder not hard against the world but it's getting solid on what it believes his faith is becoming anchored it's becoming a real Rock a real Revelation to her do you understand what I'm getting at you've got to look in nature to know your season and when you can see your season you know what's happening next when is it coming I don't know we don't know day or the hour the prophet said you might not know the day the hour but there's no reason why you can't know the season I can't tell you what day my tomato is going to be picked but I can tell you when the season's coming you take a woman that's pregnant I can't tell you what day she going have a baby well the doctor said November 22nd that's what the doctor said how many times the doctor's wrong about her pregnancy November 22nd I can't tell you what day she going to be born but when she start wobbling a little bit more she start breathing a little bit harder she oh oh something's changing I can't tell you today but I know brother Samons we entered into something the outside is testifying what she's entered into what is it birth pains are starting and when those birth pains are starting what is it doing it's testifying we might not know the hour but we know the day and the season that we're not living in what because her body's changing this bride is changing and if you can't recognize it now we're in a certain season now we're in a Time inside of that season it's time for this bride to go home let me go a little bit further brother Bram said those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened see you pick up the message and then let the son listen now bake all of the greenness out of you making you mature Christians do you see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christian for him to receive wheat has got to get ripe all right he wasn't coming for Green Seed he was coming for mature ripe seed The Prophet's going off the scene after he has swn the Green Seed but the seed is no not green anymore it's becoming flesh and that seed flesh bride has got to be a ripened seed let me go a little further I'll let you go how many understand I'm getting that we're in a season it's not seed sewing season it's not stock season it's not tassel season it's not shuck season and I want to make it real plain it's not Green Seed season so much we got the word we got the word we got the word the word is a seed but has that word matured in you listen has it become real to you has you and that word become one and the same that's mature seed that's what brother Holloway is hungering for Lord I want you to bake so much of the greenness out of me till there's nothing left but Christ brother bramman let the light turn on 1964 turn on the light it's coming Harvest is ripen the grain shall mature with the light but the thing of it is today the church grain don't want to mature it wants to stay like it was back in Moody's times sankis fny Knox Calvin they were all right they were the light of the hour but this is another hour it's another day it's the advancement of the Gospel is coming to maturity our age and our season now that we have the seed restored is the coming of maturity listen so we can't live in what Luther said Wesley said or some other the rest of them said we're living in a light that's predicted for this day what the word said about this season we're in the seventh Church age not the third fourth Church Age The Grain should be able to receive it if it doesn't it falls off and it means nothing to it but the grain is matured with the light if it goes ahead with the light we have to stay under the light of this age in order for the grain to be ripened by the light of this age I'm going to say this in closing and I told the pastor I really appreciate on his his teaching when I came in I kind of wish I felt like I needed to get back there and get quiet before I came out here this morning but I sure would have liked to sit out here and listen on what he was teaching he said he was working on Danel 70 weeks I said I'll be honest I ain't never taught on Danel 70 weeks I've studied it but I ain't never taught on it but I like hearing it t because it's part of the light of this age that we need to know to recognize where we at but I planted some Garden this past year and again I'm learning from nature I'm not a farmer naturally speaking but I want to be a better farmer because I like eating healthy I'm getting a little older now and I find that certain foods my body can do better with so I'm trying to eat healthier and I'm trying to grow my own crop and so when I planted certain produce or actually I didn't plant it we bought certain produce from the store wife and I realize the best fertilizer you can put on your garden is compost I didn't have much compost this past year so I said next year I'm I'm going plant me about five or six big compost piles and when I start my farming next spring I'm going have plenty of compost to mature that crop and so the way we make compost is we take food scraps not no meats and nothing like that just vegetables off the table and vegetables you got left over rice grains anything like that just throw it in the pile with some leaves and man that makes some of the best compost that's the best fertilizer you can come up with so as I'm putting my food scraps in this compost pile but the Simons I come out there one day in order to make compost you got to turn it you just going to throw it out there and walk away you got to work it you got to work it you follow me I came out one day to work my compost pile and I looked and I had three or four plants growing in my compost pile I said I ain't planting nothing in that compost what in the world is this I watched it and I could tell about a leaf I said it looks like a zucchini or squash or something so I took it out the compost I had to turn it and I put it in a flower pot I said I'm going to watch it just to see what happens with it and it began to grow and it begin to grow the vine got B by as far as me that that almost as far as me to that Pew right there and began to put the prettiest flowers and all of a sudden those flowers began to turn into produce and I saw something coming there about the size of my thumb I said honey I think we got zucchini I said but one problem brother Simmons it came out of season listen now in order for it to produce it came out of season if it had only came at the right time I could have had zucchini but just when it really began to take form and make zucchini guess what happened the frost came you see it tried to come forth at the wrong time if it had come forth about two months earlier it would have produced the mature crop but it missed its season yet it was the right seed do you understand we don't want to miss our season let's be sincere as James said turn our hearts towards God say Lord mature this seed whatever I'm lacking bake that out now while the sunlight still shining but there coming a day real soon people are going to want this light and it's not going to be here and the bride that followed the word and sat under that light she have come to mature seed ripen seed and the husband man has taken her from the earth let's just lay in the presence of the son and be real sincere about it and say God reveal yourself to me let me see who I am let me see this word of this age and let me see my place in it cuz this is my season and I don't want to miss it musicians come let's bow our heads let's bow our heads dear heavenly father I want to thank you for your grace thank you for giving us eyes to see giving us ears to hear to recognize this the hand of God moving upon the Earth and in this age as you have in every age there's not been an age Lord where you have had not your work being done in the earth men might not see it they might not recognize it but that doesn't mean you're not here working so many look back and say God sent a prophet and I believe that Lord or I wouldn't have quoted him today many look ahead and said there coming of rapture that's coming to Millennium I believe that and Lord I'm looking for it also but God I know that there's something happening right now the holy spirit is moving right now and Lord your spirit inside the heart of the real believer is drawing him closer to the Sun Lord you're baking out all the greenness you're baking out all the foolishness all the selfishness all the
