to visit also the other groups around surely ever since we came it's been good for us and we have really enjoyed us day thank you for keeping us thank you for all you did for us we like to appreciate the Brethren uh for being so good and know when we come together around this word is so good for us well it is my pleasure to minister to you this morning and I also bring you greetings from our people uh back home now I would like to just pick a little some little subject and um as we open to the Bible on 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 and also Ecclesiastes 3:1 2 Corinthians 5:1 reads for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens Ecclesiastes 3 one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen may God add blessings to reading of his word as we take our seats now I want to title my message seasons change seasons change but with a subheading or a thought bodies that die and bodies that don't die amen rightfully we know that for sure that we have seasons in the whole year from January to December we have seasons some have three seasons some have summer autumn winter spring some have summer and winter depending on where you are settled in this part of the globe and this seasons were ordained of God for a purpose that's why we see right there in Ecclesiastes chapter three to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven so in other words when God set out Seasons he set out purpose for every season there is a purpose that God wants to accomplish and while we see these Seasons also changing from Summer to Winter to Autumn to Spring there is also seasons for our lives that change from time to time amen we don't go just in one season but our seasons of life also changes families of Seasons you have seasons whereby everything is moving on smoothly but you come to a season also where things are just STP stey upside down there's Seasons when you are enjoying good health but there is also season when you are sick there is Seasons also for individuals there is Seasons when you are in job and there is season that you're out of job job and all those Seasons you find them in all aspects of Life the same applies we have seasons also for an individual you have seasons also for a church churches have their Seasons they Seasons when everything is okay but there is Seasons also that we go under trials but God has prepared those seasons for a purpose amen we don't shine Seasons because we don't have capacity to shine them but what you can do as a Believer is to try and comply with season because when you try to fight season you suffer the consequences Hallelujah say maybe is is the hot season and then you say no it's not hot you take a heavy jacket on you you take a heavy shirt on you the next time thing is you sweating the next thing is you collapse the next thing is you die because you are fighting season so you better comply with season God is seasons for your life amen amen when it becomes the hot season you should also put on light cloths amen you should also uh throw away your jackets but when it comes to the H H winter season you say I'm a strong man I don't put on a heavy jacket and the next thing is you shivering the next thing you are cold the next thing you have pneumonia and the next thing you die why those are the consequences of not complying with Seasons so seasons are such that they are forced upon us and when they are forced upon us we have to comply with season no doubt in your life my brother I don't know what season you're going through but some are going through the season of mouring some are going through the season of comfort that's why there you see to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose there is a time to die there is a time to leave there is a time to be comforted there is a time to gather there is a time to throw away those are the seasons of God and we have got to watch carefully when those Seasons come in God's word there is always what God says about our Seasons amen when we are in our seasons of sickness God has got a word of us oh here you oh Israel the Lord your God Health all your diseases them that believe they shall lay their hands upon the sick and the sick shall recover that's a word for the season of sickness amen amen when you lowed down and cast down when you think no one knows me when you think no one knows love don't that no one loves you no one sees you but in that season God has a word for you that God his eyes is upon the sparrow His Eye Is upon every creation His Eye Is upon the end and I want to declare this morning the eye of God is upon you no matter what season you are going through no matter what season you are suffering no matter what season lays ahead of you but God is right he is there to comfort the bered he is there to give soless to those who have lost their loved one it's a season of mourning it's a season of crying but God is right there to comfort amen amen no wonder why then the Bible shows that comfort you one another with these words so the Lord has got words of comfort he knows at some point we need to be comforted he knows at some some point we we we we are weak at some point we are crying at some point things are not moving well but he says wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen amen as much as we have words to say as much as we have things to give as much as we have cause to help with but he said Comfort one another with these words what Comforts us is God's word amen amen that's first Thessalonians 4 verse 18 wherefore Comfort one another with these words oh in the season of morning in the season of bement in the season of heaviness comfort you one another with these words that's why verse 13 of First Corinthians 4 says but but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope amen so in that season some sorrow without hope but there are some who sorrow with a hope but those who sorrow with the hope they are comforted by these words and Paul says I don't want you to be ignorant if you choose to be ignorant yourself then you can just be ignorant but you don't have to be ignorant you have to be comforted by his word when you come into God's house when the minister stands to minister is to give comfort and soulless for those who feel heavy for those who feel the loss amen amen amen so he says if we believe Jesus died and rose again so even them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with them so when you lose a loved one you can feel so sorrowful you can feel so bitten down but he says because Jesus died and rose again amen so if your loved one has died and gone to be before the Lord when Jesus comes he will bring your loved ones all you need is to be honest sincere before God then you know you'll be able to meet One of These Fine days so our source of comfort is in God's word amen amen we understand it's a change of season you cannot fight season you cannot withstand season you cannot run away from season but when season come you got to comply so as Christians how do we comply with our seasons of life we comply with our seasons of Life by the word and through the word amen amen amen and there Paul begins to mention that we who are Liv shall not hinder them who are asleep he is talking about those who have gone on before us that though they are safe and sound in the Lord but there is two groups there right who go into the change of body the one who sleep in Christ and the ones who are still alive we who are alive shall not hinder them who have gone who are dead in Christ who are asleep in Christ amen those dead in Christ shall rise first amen amen and then we who are Al second group shall be change in the twinkling of an eye then we shall go to meet up in the air and together we shall go to meet the Lord and the scripture says when we see him we shall know him why shall we know him because we will be in a body which is just like his he comes down in a glorified body and we because of the change we are also in those bodies so we will see him as he is and he will see us also as we are amen so we have a hope to comfort one another with that at least one of these five days there is going to be a gathering in the air there's going to be a meeting in the air Hallelujah Redeemer Jesus we are going to meet my brother this Stone and T body cannot be able to hold up that which God has prepared for you so this body has got to be changed this body has got to be transformed for when you die this body will lay it in the ground am because this is dust amen first God created man in his own image he was a spirit man but then he formed that man of the soil and he breathe the breath of life amen that's what when we go to the Grave we say dust Thou Art and unto dust shall thou remain this is for this natural body but for the soul which came from God which is the gene of life which is your representation because you're either represented from on high or you represented from the pit of Hell so what happens here is you are represented somewhere amen and I thank God with you and I we are represented from on high amen amen So when you say d Thou Art and unto D shall thou remain that's this body that was not say to the soul but the soul goes back to the owner because that's the gene of life that's the GTI Gene of God that's the life that God imparted unto you am amen so do you see that my brother my sister so you see in Seasons as seasons change the seasons of Our Lives also change we have the season of mortal life the season of mortal life is the season when we are living this body of life this house of glay One of These Fine days shall best wide open One of These Fine days shall give up oh I'm looking forward for a day when I give up this body and that body that's waiting for me I go into it no sooner do I step out of this body I enter into a Heavenly Body I enter intoh that Celestial body and Heavenly Body so when you die you don't just move around like a spirit but there is a body that's waiting for you and that body that's waiting for you is that one whereby it cannot get sick that one cannot get tired that one cannot get old I am longing for that body I am longing and ending for that body whereby I will never be sick whereby I'll will never die whereby I'll never have gray hair whereby I'll never get tired all that day is coming Hallelujah so you see right there we have mortal bodies which is our natural bodies where we stay so we have the season of natural bodies the season of mortal life in the season of mortal life we get married in the season of mortal life we have wives in the season of mortal life we have children in the season of mortal life we go to work in the season of mortal life we get old we get tired we get young in the season of mortal life because we are governed by time amen as time moves our bodies show how much time we have moved amen amen that's a season but my brother my sister there is yet another season when we step out of the season of mortal life we step into the season of Immortal Life Immortal Life is a life that cannot die Amen in other words when you have eternal life then you cannot die in that body my brother my sister we stand in his presence in that body We Are Forever More there Hallelujah no more bad thoughts no more bad ideas why because we are in the season of immortal life amen now in that in that season we don't stay natural houses in the season of mortal life you stay in your house which is built of morar which is built of dager but in the season of immortal life you don't stay there he says in my father's kingdoms are many mansions how can a kingdom have in my father's house are many mansions how can Mansions be in a house that is a domain that is a kingdom in my father's kingdom are many borders in my father's kingdom are many houses that when you step out of this house you go into that house no wonder why Jesus said oh he says about his body destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up some thought he was referring to Solomon's Temple yet he was referring to his own body so when you're speaking about the temple there he speaking about your body amen so we have another season that's coming that's a season of immortal life that's a season oh because everything has got Seasons amen amen even Ministries have got Seasons you've got them in their High season and they go into their middle season and they go into their Pig season amen life always has got his season you start young energetic you go in the middle there and then you come now to the Old Stage amen it's seasons of life and as seasons of Life come God has prepared us for each stage of the season of life amen hallelujah amen so you see right there as seasons change we comply with the change of season oh this morning it is my prayer that God can undertake for you also that if you're in the season of sickness that God can be able to heal you in the name of Jesus Christ we want to bind all sicknesses we want to evict all sick sickness and disease in Jesus Christ's name you be delivered why God has a better season for you and the better Seasons where you can enjoy your good health oh my brother my sister maybe you are too long in your season you are not married but you want to be married God can change your season God can be able to Grant you a a a a a partner for Life a husband for Life a wife for life can he can change your season amen maybe youve been looking for a job for too long but you canot get a job somehow but God can change your season and give you yet a job to live by amen amen maybe you've been looking for a breakthrough you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost you feel that I want more and more of God it's a season God Can Break Forth That season before you and give it to you amen amen seasons change amen allow the change of season don't continue in yesterday's season you need a season of today when you take breakfast in the morning it's one season but you cannot take breakfast at 12 12 noon you have to take lunch because it's now another season so a season dictates to you what you are to feed upon what you are to eat on and when you come to supper you cannot take lunch because it's another season the same applies in our lives like in this time we are living in the end times time is far spend we are living the closing moments of life of of this world things are top stey why it's another season it calls upon us to be ready I want to be ready I want to be ready to walk in Jerusalem just like John it's a season when we need to eat that word like never before it's a season when we need to be persistent like never before it's a season when we've got to come to church like never before it's a season when we've got to praise him like never before it's a season where we've got to be honest like never before it's a season where we have to look up to God like never before Hallelujah of Jesus that's our season amen when people are finding no use to save the Lord we are saying this is our season amen though we are getting gray haired we will saving all the same if the young people refuse to save him we will save him with our gray hair until we rest it's another season my brother you better say Lord help me I don't want to miss my season I don't want to miss the season of the hour I don't want to miss what God has prepared for us for this day amen seasons change amen amen amen and when season change you have to comply with season you have to move with season so there is a time to be born there is a time to die there is a time to plant there is a time to plant now there is nothing wrong with each one of these Seasons amen but it's when you don't know why that season has to be there that's why you are worried it's a time to plant but after planting you're waiting for the time of pling Amen so when you get to understand that in planting God has a purpose in pling God has a purpose that comforts you to know that is all moving according to season amen so season is a time frame in that time frame once you fulfill God's purpose he takes you off now when you fulfilled God's purpose for your life amen then God takes you into another season you find with plants they grow up they get big green leaves but somewhere around this time or whatever winter you begin to see the leaves are turning yellow why because they have served their purpose and once theyve served their purpose you are looking forward for another season am you see God put us here on Earth to see save a purpose and that purpose is to save him we save him with our lives if we are a mechanic you save him with the life if you a doctor you save him with the life if you are a preacher you save him with the life then it becomes God in you and you become written Epistles that are read by all men amen amen so you see seasons have got to have a purpose and seasons are supposed to be there though rough though difficult but God has a purpose for each and every season amen amen amen how do you know if it's not the breaking forth of another season in your life amen maybe you've been struggling so much maybe your vision is not been clear maybe you were thinking of backsliding maybe you thinking of B giving up maybe we now just so loose but let me tell you my brother my sister you are the bring of the breaking forth of another season amen would you want to step into that season this morning amen would you want to have that season this morning may God help you and Grant you the grace God bless you amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise God Amen that was too short [Laughter] huh praise God we thank the Lord amen it's your season Amen to be blessed amen somebody great God we thank God for pastor Danny we thank you for his son and and I want to say this morning whatever you need the Lord has it praise God it's time that you recognize your season [Music] it's your season to be blessed it's your time to give God you all to praise him with everything you [Music] got I think I was telling brother Nathan to somebody his life is like a Vaper it's it's gone before you know it but it just vanishes out your sight and nothing in this world is worth dying for but there's a world that God has prepared for us that's worth living for amen amen amen nothing in this world could feel the void the deep that it's calling to the Deep amen the thing that we need nothing in this world is worth it am nothing in this world is worth your soul amen amen you'll find out that this life will be many [Music] disappointments you'll be disappointed if all you had was this life all your achievement at the end of the road you find out none of this was worth it my soul Amen brother and sister I would give up this Vanity Vanity said the preacher all is Vanity but I want something that's real because all of [Music] this even this is not to real you it's a result of the fall but the real one is the inside inner man so by the grace of God do you want to make a change are you willing to make a change and say God I want to serve your purpose because I believe the pastor
