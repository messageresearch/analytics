[48:38] chapter by the grace of God try not to
[48:41] hold you long this morning amen God is
[48:43] good ain't
[48:45] it we want to talk about the invisible
[48:48] realm this morning amen the invisible
[48:52] realm Hebrews
[48:54] 11:1 if you got it say amen amen
[48:57] and it reads now Faith is the substance
[49:01] of things hoped for the evidence of
[49:04] things not what seen seen for by it the
[49:08] elders obtained a good report yes that
[49:11] through faith we understand that the
[49:13] worlds were framed by the word of what
[49:17] come on now not by the word of some
[49:20] great bishop or Apostle or preacher
[49:24] right or church but we know that it was
[49:27] framed by what the word of God Amen so
[49:31] the word of God has power in it doesn't
[49:33] it it's power in his word amen amen to
[49:36] what create right amen so so that the
[49:40] things which are seen were not made by
[49:43] the things which do appear you may be
[49:45] seated this
[49:47] morning God bless the reading of his
[49:49] word and read a little bit more but we
[49:51] want to talk about the invisible real
[49:53] this morning amen the invisible Realm
[49:57] when you when you talking about
[49:58] something invisible you you're defining
[50:01] a force that can't be seen with the
[50:03] natural eye
[50:05] right can't be seen you know just out
[50:09] like that but sometimes you have to take
[50:12] instruments to see that which is
[50:14] invisible right I you know electrician
[50:18] by trade I always tell people that you
[50:20] know as an electrician you dealing with
[50:23] something you can't see you have no even
[50:26] real knowledge of it's there you can't
[50:28] see it you can't smell it is no way that
[50:32] the five senses unless you grab hold to
[50:35] it can tell that it's there now you'll
[50:38] know it's there then you grab hold to it
[50:40] the wrong way right but we do have
[50:44] certain things that we can use to gauge
[50:47] how much voltage or or or amperage is
[50:50] flowing through something right but it's
[50:53] there but all the time but we we can't
[50:55] see it right
[50:57] so when we thinking about like we said
[51:00] the invisible real we talking about
[51:02] stuff that you can't see right so we
[51:05] know that you know many of times we only
[51:10] look to the things that we can see
[51:11] without natural eyes right and some of
[51:15] the people that can't see they only look
[51:18] to the things that where they can touch
[51:20] right feel Conta in his five senses so
[51:25] the body itself is is limited to this
[51:27] world right but I'm preaching to you
[51:31] this morning that is another realm out
[51:34] there
[51:35] hallelujah it's another place
[51:38] Hallelujah that we don't know about
[51:42] sometimes but in that place there there
[51:45] is no law of gravity Hallelujah there is
[51:49] no law of the five senses in that in
[51:52] that realm Hallelujah all things are
[51:55] possible amen that real you ain't
[51:58] limited by what the doctor say
[52:00] hallelujah or what your bank account
[52:02] saying or whatever it might be in that
[52:04] realm you're not limited Hallelujah
[52:06] because in that realm all things are
[52:09] possible so a lot of times as we say we
[52:12] we govern ourselves by this by by that
[52:17] this realm we living in but you know in
[52:20] that realm you know as we talk about
[52:23] instruments to the the the contact
[52:25] things in other Realms and and that real
[52:28] the the instrument that's needed I would
[52:30] call it to contact that real is Faith
[52:34] Hallelujah faith will unlock things for
[52:38] you in your life you know it's something
[52:41] about faith that you know you can have
[52:44] faith in many things right people can
[52:47] have faith in the doctor have faith in
[52:49] this and that's all right sometimes but
[52:52] your faith can't rest in that because
[52:55] when that fail
[52:57] then that's the end that's the end of
[52:59] the line Hallelujah because that's where
[53:02] your faith ended at right but you know
[53:06] uh I often say sometimes about you know
[53:10] uh Moses and this he was born his mother
[53:14] you know she HD him for so many months
[53:16] long as she can hide him right but when
[53:18] she couldn't hide him no more Hallelujah
[53:22] and they took that basket and put it out
[53:24] in the river she least that the God it
[53:28] was no longer in her control now she was
[53:31] looking to the invisible realm right she
[53:35] take it out of her hands now the
[53:37] situation is out of my control now I'm
[53:40] putting it in God's hand come on that's
[53:43] when Faith started right there at the
[53:45] river Hallelujah and what it was in that
[53:48] real Hallelujah the crocodiles or
[53:51] whatever was in the river at that time
[53:54] they couldn't touch that basket or that
[53:56] Arc that he was in because he was
[53:59] protected by something that was
[54:02] invisible y'all believe that this
[54:03] morning come on Hallelujah they might
[54:06] have been 9 10t long or so powerful
[54:10] might have had hippos or whatever out
[54:12] there but they couldn't cross that
[54:14] barrier that God had around them
[54:18] Hallelujah it was a hedge around that
[54:20] basket come on now somebody says that
[54:24] was a miracle yes it was a miracle God
[54:27] still work miracles don't and you know
[54:30] many of times our situations look
[54:32] hopeless don't it looks might bad but in
[54:36] the other realm somewhere come on it's
[54:39] Angels yes it's barriers around you the
[54:43] devil and all the signs want to breach
[54:47] that barrier but they can't J Hallelujah
[54:51] God's got a barrier around me ain't you
[54:53] glad this morning that God has a barrier
[54:56] around
[54:57] you glory to God God knows what he doing
[55:01] don't he come on but I says in the that
[55:03] that room you know and that's we we so
[55:06] limited a lot of times but the hour that
[55:08] we're living in you know even though the
[55:11] world and all of its goods and all of
[55:13] its resources even here in America we
[55:16] coming back to that time to where it
[55:18] ain't going to mean a thing come on now
[55:22] how much money you got ain't going to
[55:23] mean nothing after a while how young you
[55:26] are ain't going to mean nothing after a
[55:27] while even if you live long enough
[55:30] that's going to change ain't it come on
[55:32] now but you know say I'm young come on
[55:35] but I know that you know even Caleb had
[55:39] had a testimony once he said I was 40
[55:41] something years old when Moses does
[55:44] promised me the mountain and I'm 85 now
[55:46] he says but I'm just as strong today as
[55:49] I was back then why because it wasn't a
[55:52] natural strength that he was looking at
[55:54] but it was the strength in that other
[55:56] realm Hallelujah I'm just as strong as
[55:59] my faith is hallelujah I'm just as
[56:02] strong as my God is oh Jesus
[56:07] Hallelujah but we find that I says you
[56:09] know many times you know you got faith
[56:11] in many things but your faith if if it's
[56:15] resting on anything else when that thing
[56:17] fa fails your faith your faith fall with
[56:20] it your situation fall with it but faith
[56:23] has to find a resting place and the
[56:26] resting place that faith loves to rest
[56:29] in and that is the proven word of God
[56:33] Amen come on how many know God's word is
[56:35] proven this morning come on now I ain't
[56:38] talking about something that they just
[56:40] came up with and they don't know whether
[56:41] it's going to with stand the the Fire or
[56:43] the floods come on but I'm talking about
[56:46] something that's already been battle
[56:48] tested already been proven that it'll
[56:52] withstand the hardest of Trials the
[56:54] hardest of storms the Great greatest of
[56:57] wins Hallelujah God's word will
[57:00] withstand all of that want it come on
[57:03] you know I I worked in
[57:05] U out in the in in uh in in the military
[57:09] we had the Doomsday bunker on the base I
[57:13] was at you go so many feet down below
[57:16] the ground and they said they got enough
[57:18] supplies to last so many years down
[57:20] there you know and the thing is they
[57:22] they only had room for the president and
[57:25] his immediate family and his cabinet and
[57:29] their immediate family so you and I will
[57:31] be left out right but they said it the
[57:33] barriers could withstand so much of a
[57:36] blast and this and that but our question
[57:38] was how do y'all know has it it has it
[57:41] been tested out yet come on now see they
[57:45] just talking in theory of what it could
[57:48] do but it ain't facts because it ain't
[57:50] been tested yet come on so they putting
[57:53] a confidence in a theory right something
[57:58] that might fail and it might not fail
[58:00] Hallelujah but you and I won't have to
[58:02] worry about going down there anyway
[58:04] because we Wen invited come on but this
[58:09] morning our conference ain't in the
[58:11] Doomsday bunker amen amen ain't in a
[58:14] theory of man but our confidence is in
[58:17] what the proven word of God hallelujah
[58:21] and in his word it says that heaven and
[58:24] earth will pass away
[58:26] but my word shall not pass right come on
[58:30] now oh Jesus I'm my faith is resting in
[58:35] The Proven word of God that he said try
[58:38] me and see won't I do what I said that's
[58:41] way my faith is resting at when no food
[58:44] is on the table Hallelujah I never seen
[58:47] the righteous forsaken nor SE baging for
[58:50] bread God's got blessings for us come on
[58:54] now I said your faith come on in The
[58:57] Invisible realm but we find that like we
[58:59] says you know uh uh those things aren't
[59:02] aren't proven right or they in theory
[59:05] because they'll fail you sometimes you
[59:08] know I was sharing at the church Friday
[59:09] night I said you know I was in prayer
[59:11] the other day and I was meditating and I
[59:15] said Lord the scripture came to my mind
[59:17] that God is not a man that he should lie
[59:20] come on now and it was so powerful
[59:24] because you can begin to think about
[59:27] what's bothering you right now
[59:29] Hallelujah you can think about what El
[59:32] you right now right and I know one thing
[59:35] that God is not a man that he should lie
[59:39] whatever God promised you you and I this
[59:41] morning all of his promises are yay and
[59:44] not n and that's why we can walk
[59:47] Victorious that's why we can have joy
[59:50] unspeakable and full of Glory that's why
[59:53] we can shout when we come in the house
[59:55] of God that's why we can lift up our
[59:57] hands and say praise God
[1:00:00] anyhow Hallelujah anyhow that's why we
[1:00:04] can do those things because we know that
[1:00:07] our God can't lie the promises that he
[1:00:10] made us come on now
[1:00:14] hallelujah oh Jesus I was saying that
[1:00:18] the other night I says the scripture
[1:00:20] came to my mind I says God is not a man
[1:00:22] that he should lie come on God God is is
[1:00:26] still a Creator I started saying to
[1:00:28] myself God is still a Creator God can
[1:00:31] create when all the resources and
[1:00:34] everything fell God can
[1:00:36] create I believe it Hallelujah that's
[1:00:39] what my faith says hallelujah oh Jesus I
[1:00:44] started saying God Is A Healer
[1:00:46] Hallelujah come on
[1:00:49] now body wrecking with pain or whatever
[1:00:51] it might be God Is A Healer I meant to
[1:00:54] tell uh brother Sim the other day I my
[1:00:57] leg was hurting me on the left leg it
[1:01:00] was hurting me bad and all the everybody
[1:01:03] at work caging me you need to go to the
[1:01:05] doctor go to the doctor and I told him
[1:01:07] I'd go see the doctor but that Friday
[1:01:10] night I asked R Sim to pray for me back
[1:01:12] there in the back and he prayed for my
[1:01:16] leg and as I was sitting here on the
[1:01:19] front row seat I started feeling like it
[1:01:22] was something tight on my leg to me I I
[1:01:25] felt felt like I said is that big knot
[1:01:27] on my leg shrinking that's what I
[1:01:29] started thinking but you know by the
[1:01:32] next day that thing was gone half down
[1:01:34] the size it was and so even you know it
[1:01:37] hadn't the pain and all hadn't come back
[1:01:38] to this day now it's just like a a
[1:01:40] little lump or something there but I
[1:01:42] says what it is God is still healing now
[1:01:46] God is the Healer the boys at work asked
[1:01:48] me they say you went to the doctor I
[1:01:50] said no I had to passor pray for it
[1:01:52] Hallelujah and I believe that come on am
[1:01:56] but what it is if your faith don't if
[1:01:58] you don't believe in that come on you
[1:02:00] only limited to this real come on but in
[1:02:03] that invisible real in that place
[1:02:07] miracles happen healings take place
[1:02:10] Revival breaks out things happen in that
[1:02:13] place Hallelujah am oh Jesus and that's
[1:02:17] the place we want to live in this
[1:02:19] morning but we find it I say many of
[1:02:22] times you know we we have we we we're
[1:02:26] governed by this realm I want to I I was
[1:02:28] meditating I says what it is you know
[1:02:32] uh what you can talk sometimes and and
[1:02:35] you don't understand many of times the
[1:02:38] power that your your your words have you
[1:02:41] don't understand the power that you got
[1:02:43] in your mouth come on come on now he
[1:02:46] says in one place that if you say to the
[1:02:49] mountain not touch it not do anything
[1:02:51] but if you say to the mountain be thou
[1:02:54] removed it'll remove itself he says but
[1:02:56] you got to have what faith and don't
[1:02:59] doubt it if you speak to the mountain

[1:03:22] testifying how about it speak it and
[1:03:25] start worshiping God
[1:03:28] hallelujah oh Jesus it's power in what
[1:03:31] you got in your mouth come on now life
[1:03:34] and death is there you know I was I was
[1:03:37] demonstrating that the other day to the
[1:03:39] CH children in Bible study I was
[1:03:43] explaining to them I I started talking
[1:03:45] to them about uh the the forest and the
[1:03:48] green leaves and then the winter comes
[1:03:51] and I started describing how the winter
[1:03:54] comes and all the leaves fall off now
[1:03:56] you can see through and but I was making
[1:03:57] it intentionally describing it right and
[1:04:01] I can see them go until days my My
[1:04:04] Little Children right and I said see
[1:04:07] just by me talking about it you already
[1:04:09] got an image in your
[1:04:11] mind I said just by me speaking talking
[1:04:15] like that it already created an image in
[1:04:17] your mind you can see it already can't
[1:04:19] you Hallelujah and my little daughter
[1:04:22] Mary said yeah can I said see what it is
[1:04:24] what you're saying Ain got power in it
[1:04:27] that's right when you're speaking
[1:04:28] negative and you speaking about all the
[1:04:30] bad things and all the signs Hallelujah
[1:04:33] and all the pain and all the hurt when
[1:04:36] you talking about it something is being
[1:04:38] created by what you're talking about
[1:04:41] when you talking about oh it might not
[1:04:43] be and how all this and all the doubts
[1:04:46] and the fears it creates a image in the
[1:04:49] mind come on now and it may determine
[1:04:52] the outcome oh Jesus I can see how those
[1:04:57] 10 spies they come back or 12 Spies they
[1:05:00] come back from seeing the land
[1:05:02] Hallelujah even though they brought the
[1:05:05] fruit of the land Hallelujah they
[1:05:08] brought back the evidence that the land
[1:05:11] is just like what God promised it to be
[1:05:15] God didn't lie to us it's flowing with
[1:05:18] milk and honey hallelujah oh Jesus they
[1:05:22] brought back the evidence of it
[1:05:25] Hallelujah the grapes and the fruit of
[1:05:27] it I can see Israel rejoicing when they
[1:05:30] saw the evidence of it come on God has
[1:05:33] brought us through this and he's brought
[1:05:35] us through that and he's told us and
[1:05:38] made us promises and now we at the point
[1:05:41] of a breakthrough and the land is just
[1:05:44] like what God said it to be hallelujah
[1:05:47] oh Jesus God I'm brought some of us from
[1:05:50] a mighty long way and sometimes we right
[1:05:53] there at the point of a breakthrough
[1:05:55] Hallelujah I said Don't Let The Devil
[1:05:58] stop you when you at the point of a
[1:06:00] breakthrough oh
[1:06:02] Jesus
[1:06:04] Hallelujah but you see how powerful the
[1:06:07] voice
[1:06:08] was what did those spies started doing
[1:06:11] the 10 or whatever they started saying
[1:06:13] yeah the land is what God Said but it's
[1:06:16] Giants in the land yeah they started
[1:06:19] describing the cities and the wall
[1:06:21] cities and the Giants and then one of
[1:06:23] them even says we in our own eyes are
[1:06:25] like
[1:06:26] grasshoppers Hallelujah got fear broke
[1:06:30] in the hearts of the people right
[1:06:33] because of the words that they spoke it
[1:06:35] it created a image in their mind right
[1:06:39] that they saw themselves as grasshoppers
[1:06:41] they saw themselves as a defeated Church

[1:08:57] ministry today tries to get the people
[1:08:59] to see Hallelujah that don't put your
[1:09:01] trust in this in this world don't put
[1:09:04] your confidence in the church Hallelujah
[1:09:07] don't put your confidence in some man or
[1:09:09] Creed a Dogma don't put your confidence
[1:09:12] there because all these things will be
[1:09:14] shaken soon sooner sooner or later in a
[1:09:18] little while these things will be shaken
[1:09:20] but if your confidence is in the word of
[1:09:23] God hallelujah that's what the whole
[1:09:26] reading of the scriptures was about by
[1:09:28] faith they move mountains by faith they
[1:09:32] top of armies by faith Hallelujah
[1:09:35] Miracles all these things were wrought
[1:09:37] by faith God did the

[1:09:44] for you somebody give the Lord Praise
[1:09:46] this morning come
[1:09:48] on I said it's the invisible realm you
[1:09:52] know what what stirred me we were having
[1:09:55] Bible study at work the other day I call
[1:09:57] it Bible study cuz we all just getting
[1:10:00] in but I was sharing with them I say the
[1:10:02] thing is you know I was telling them I
[1:10:04] says it's things in this room right now
[1:10:07] that you can't
[1:10:08] see
[1:10:09] Hallelujah I said you can't see I said
[1:10:12] let me it's for example I I begin to
[1:10:14] talk about how you know you can cut you
[1:10:17] can cut your radio on on a certain
[1:10:19] Channel if anybody on there talking
[1:10:21] you'll pick it up right and that channel
[1:10:25] a and and that radio ain't connected to
[1:10:26] nothing on the other end it's just all
[1:10:28] through waves right but I said you turn
[1:10:30] the radio on right now to a certain
[1:10:32] Channel you can pick it up right I said
[1:10:35] how why because it's already in the room
[1:10:36] going through right now but we just
[1:10:38] don't have no knowledge of it but man is
[1:10:41] found a way to to catch what's in that
[1:10:43] room ain't it Hallelujah so I begin
[1:10:46] breaking down things like that to him
[1:10:48] and I says you know that's the same
[1:10:50] thing I says sometimes we look at God
[1:10:53] and Heaven and all that to be somewhere
[1:10:54] far off
[1:10:55] but it ain't it's right here among you
[1:10:58] how how many believe that this morning
[1:11:00] he says we're now in Heavenly places in
[1:11:02] Christ Jesus right if we in Heavenly
[1:11:04] places then we is where God is at right
[1:11:07] come on I says right now in this room
[1:11:09] it's unseen forces it's things in this
[1:11:12] room right now hallelujah it's angels in
[1:11:15] the room and there demons in there too
[1:11:17] come on but I said it's angels in the
[1:11:20] room it's things in the room that you
[1:11:21] don't have no knowledge about come on in
[1:11:24] that the things that you can't see are
[1:11:27] greater than the things that we're
[1:11:29] seeing come on but God has got to open
[1:11:32] your eyes hallelujah amen that you can
[1:11:35] quit looking at your situation amen you
[1:11:38] can quit looking at what you fa with
[1:11:40] quit looking at what you're dealing with
[1:11:43] come on and look to that unseen realm
[1:11:46] look to that unseen Force that's in the
[1:11:48] room hallelujah oh Jesus come on now but
[1:11:52] what it is we we can't do it sometime we
[1:11:55] struggle with that don't we come on we
[1:11:57] struggle with that but I says the thing
[1:12:00] about it is you know the Bible declares
[1:12:02] here in the here in the in the uh six
[1:12:05] verse 11 and 6 he says but without faith
[1:12:09] it's what come on now it ain't even
[1:12:13] possible to please God come on amen amen
[1:12:16] to please God he says without faith is
[1:12:19] what imposs come on it ain't even
[1:12:21] possible come on why would God make it
[1:12:25] that way he's God he can do whatever you
[1:12:27] want right but without faith it's
[1:12:30] impossible to to please him amen but he
[1:12:33] says that for he that cometh to God must
[1:12:37] believe that he what he is and that he
[1:12:40] is a what rewarder of them that do what
[1:12:45] come on now what if it don't happen
[1:12:46] after the first day come on what if it
[1:12:50] don't look like God moved after the
[1:12:52] first week come on he says you got have
[1:12:55] faith right sometime God tries your
[1:12:58] faith you say Lord I got faith for God
[1:13:00] will try you by that Faith won't he come
[1:13:02] on but one thing about it he's not a man
[1:13:04] that he should lie right come on he'll
[1:13:07] show up every time War him come on now
[1:13:09] you your faith going to be tried now you
[1:13:12] going to be Tried by what you say you
[1:13:14] believe you know those Hebrew boys they
[1:13:16] was tried wasn't they come on now they
[1:13:19] believed in a God that could deliver
[1:13:22] amen hallelujah amen do do you believe
[1:13:25] in a God that can deliver come on now we
[1:13:29] ain't going to obey the king's order my
[1:13:31] God can deliver amen oh Jesus amen I'm
[1:13:36] not looking at how big the situation is
[1:13:38] I'm looking at how big my God is God can
[1:13:42] deliver right come on now but their
[1:13:45] faith was tried wasn't it come on you
[1:13:48] know God allow them to go all the way to
[1:13:50] the fire didn't he not just to the door
[1:13:53] but he allowed them to get in the Fire
[1:13:54] come on
[1:13:55] but it's something about it they believe
[1:13:57] that their God could deliver right they
[1:14:00] said King we know that even if he don't
[1:14:03] he's still able that ain't taken away
[1:14:05] from who he is come on now I believe God
[1:14:09] can smile on somebody with a faith like
[1:14:11] that come on but when they got in there
[1:14:13] fire what happened God showed up right
[1:14:16] there along with them didn't he come on
[1:14:18] now but you got to have faith to believe
[1:14:20] that right you know I remember little
[1:14:23] testimony one night I was at work
[1:14:26] and years ago when I first got saved and
[1:14:30] you know how it is when you first get
[1:14:32] saved you stirred and you telling
[1:14:33] everybody about Jesus come on everywhere
[1:14:36] you go Jesus is on your lips sometime

[1:14:40] Wildfire is better than none at all come
[1:14:43] on now out there witnessing and I was I
[1:14:46] was sharing with the guys I say hey you
[1:14:48] know I was talking about the Hebrew boys

[1:14:53] about the fire and how they got in the
[1:14:55] fire Hallelujah and how not even the the
[1:14:59] the the clothes that they they that they
[1:15:01] had on smelt like smoke God took care of
[1:15:03] them boys in the fire Hallelujah so I
[1:15:06] was sharing that with him and the
[1:15:07] Jehovah Witness guy told me he says now
[1:15:10] do you I know you don't believe that
[1:15:12] Hallelujah he said you got to be crazy
[1:15:15] to believe that I said well I may be I
[1:15:18] must be crazy then because I believe it
[1:15:20] amen he said was you there no I wasn't
[1:15:23] there but I heard it and I believe it am
[1:15:26] I believe my God can answer Hallelujah
[1:15:29] he is the consuming fire but I was
[1:15:32] sharing that with those and so we went
[1:15:34] back to working that night and I had on
[1:15:37] some some windbreaker pants nobody they
[1:15:39] don't wear them no more but the art from
[1:15:42] the art from one of the Sparks and one
[1:15:46] of the things must have got out and got
[1:15:48] all on my pants God is my witness so I
[1:15:51] was standing up after I got out that
[1:15:54] pipe from Weller and I stood up and I
[1:15:56] says you
[1:15:58] know felt a little
[1:16:00] warm right and I says when I fli my
[1:16:05] welding shell up Flames was coming all

[1:16:10] so I stopped and dropped and roll you
[1:16:12] what you call it get myself out right
[1:16:15] but the miracle was when I put myself
[1:16:17] out everybody looked at me oh they
[1:16:19] thought I was burned up but they looked
[1:16:21] at me and all of the windbreaker pants
[1:16:24] had burn turn all around my leg nothing
[1:16:28] but my underwears was showing come on
[1:16:31] but not one part of my skin was
[1:16:33] blistered or burnt or anything it burned
[1:16:35] all the way around there come on now
[1:16:38] that was right after I got done
[1:16:40] testifying about how great my God is
[1:16:43] come on now and they said you want to go
[1:16:46] to the doctor I said no take me to that
[1:16:48] Jehovah Witness hallelujah oh Jesus God
[1:16:52] is my witness when I got to him I says
[1:16:54] God is able to do what he said

[1:17:01] able come on now they was like Ernest
[1:17:04] you want to go home and change clothes I
[1:17:06] said no I'm going to work like this all
[1:17:08] night because I want somebody to ask me
[1:17:10] what happened so I can testify
[1:17:13] Hallelujah about how good God is and
[1:17:16] about how great God is hallelu I held on
[1:17:20] to those pants for a long time as a
[1:17:22] memorial I can look back and say that
[1:17:24] God is the fire Hallelujah he is the
[1:17:27] consuming fire if God can do that what
[1:17:31] can't God do
[1:17:33] hallelujah oh Jesus come on now
[1:17:37] sometimes God do things to to shut up
[1:17:39] all the doubts come on to shut up all
[1:17:42] the critics Hallelujah it ain't that you
[1:17:44] get no glory but God is getting all the
[1:17:46] glory because people don't call you
[1:17:48] crazy and they talked about you I like
[1:17:50] that whisper a prayer when men don't
[1:17:52] believe you Hallelujah but God do it
[1:17:56] want come on now but you got to have
[1:17:59] faith right in the what invisible realm
[1:18:02] come on now but I say that what it is
[1:18:05] God does those things before you come to
[1:18:07] him you got to have faith right and
[1:18:10] believe amen cuz without faith it's
[1:18:13] impossible sometimes when you talk to
[1:18:16] people and try to help them with
[1:18:18] situations they come with all of the
[1:18:20] things that's wrong right and all of the
[1:18:23] problems and all of the the nose right
[1:18:26] but you try to point them to the Bible
[1:18:28] and wear all of your nose God says yes
[1:18:32] come on Amen when everybody say no God
[1:18:36] say yes but you got to believe that he
[1:18:39] can do it for
[1:18:41] you but you don't know you don't know I
[1:18:44] might not know but I know who do knows
[1:18:47] and that's God hallelujah and he is able
[1:18:51] come on now oh Jesus but I says that
[1:18:54] what is looking at that so I was sharing
[1:18:56] you know we were having Bible study the
[1:18:58] other day I was doing all the
[1:19:00] talking but they were stirred amen cuz
[1:19:04] I'm giving them something to to think
[1:19:06] about now I said you know one thing
[1:19:09] about it you know uh a science always
[1:19:12] try to discredit God don't they always
[1:19:16] try to I was talking to them about the
[1:19:18] the partho Genesis I think I preached a
[1:19:21] message on that one time and how some
[1:19:23] animals can reproduct without you know
[1:19:26] the the the sperm or or whatever and
[1:19:28] they were saying that that possibly what
[1:19:30] happened to Mary come on and talking
[1:19:32] about they they call it the the the
[1:19:34] Virgin birth phenomenon Hallelujah so I
[1:19:37] read a little bit about what they
[1:19:39] talking about and they call me crazy
[1:19:41] Hallelujah they call you and I that
[1:19:43] believe that the word of God framed the
[1:19:45] world's crazy but go listen to what they
[1:19:47] talking
[1:19:48] about come on but the thing is I was
[1:19:51] explaining to them that I say what the
[1:19:53] Science World calls it they they call it
[1:19:55] it the God particle they don't
[1:19:58] understand where the intelligence come
[1:20:00] from and I was talking with the guy he
[1:20:02] was talking about how you planting a
[1:20:03] tree and I was asking them do you know
[1:20:05] how that tree survives in the winter
[1:20:07] time come on because all the sapl or the
[1:20:09] life or whatever that's in the tree
[1:20:11] before the fall and the winter comes
[1:20:14] it'll go down into the roots of the tree
[1:20:16] Hallelujah that that tree might look
[1:20:18] like it's dead come on in the winter
[1:20:21] time but it's still life the life is
[1:20:23] down at the roots it it's just going
[1:20:26] through a little season right now but
[1:20:29] when that season is over the life is
[1:20:31] coming back out oh Jesus come on now all
[1:20:35] right I said that tree just going
[1:20:37] through a little something right now
[1:20:38] come on now but that's the same way it
[1:20:40] is in our lives ain't it come on
[1:20:43] sometimes we look at situation people
[1:20:45] don't realize come on but they might
[1:20:46] just be going through a little something
[1:20:48] right now come on don't worry about it
[1:20:50] because of the life of God was ever in
[1:20:52] there it ain't going to die come on oh
[1:20:55] Jesus but was was talking about that and
[1:20:58] and how you know they was trying to
[1:21:00] figure out how the tree has its own
[1:21:03] intelligence how the the the animals
[1:21:06] have their own intelligence and all
[1:21:07] these things it said if we can crack
[1:21:09] that then we can crack the God particle
[1:21:13] we can break into things that we'll defy
[1:21:16] gravity we'll be able to live forever
[1:21:17] and all these things but what they
[1:21:19] looking for Hallelujah God has already
[1:21:22] revealed it to us hallelujah we didn't
[1:21:25] have to spend no money in all this
[1:21:27] research to find out about it Hallelujah
[1:21:29] but it's by faith these things are found
[1:21:31] out come on they looking for how you
[1:21:34] live forever but God has given us the
[1:21:36] answer didn't he Hallelujah he says I'm
[1:21:40] the way the truth and the life
[1:21:42] Hallelujah am oh Jesus come on
[1:21:46] now God so loved the world he gave his
[1:21:49] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:21:51] believeth in him Hallelujah come on
[1:21:55] amen God has already given us the ab but
[1:21:57] I was sharing that with them I said what
[1:21:58] it is come on you looking at something
[1:22:01] they want to be able to man always want
[1:22:03] to find a way that they can tangibly
[1:22:06] touch it feel it or yet they won't
[1:22:09] believe it they restrict it come on but
[1:22:12] if you would only know Hallelujah to
[1:22:14] reach out as these in faith God called
[1:22:18] them but the thing that they had to do
[1:22:20] they had to hear the voice amen and
[1:22:22] after they heard the voice they had to
[1:22:24] move move upon the voice that they heard
[1:22:26] going out not being able to see it but
[1:22:29] the Bible says that Abraham though he he
[1:22:32] he when he God called him come on he
[1:22:34] says he he was surging on the strange
[1:22:36] places right going to and fro looking
[1:22:40] for a city whose Builder and maker was
[1:22:42] who God come on now let's let's read
[1:22:45] that here in the in the eth verse he
[1:22:49] says by faith Abraham when he was called
[1:22:52] to go out into a place which should have
[1:22:55] after receive for his
[1:22:58] inheritance obeyed come on now he had to
[1:23:00] obey God didn't he come on now he was
[1:23:03] called but he had to obey him right so
[1:23:06] many people say God Ain never I never
[1:23:08] seen God do I never seen God do have you
[1:23:10] obeyed the Lord this morning have you
[1:23:13] stayed long enough to wait on the Lord
[1:23:16] come on patience is more precious in
[1:23:18] Gold have you stayed long enough to wait
[1:23:21] on them come on now he says but
[1:23:25] and he went out not knowing where he
[1:23:28] went come on he didn't seem to have no
[1:23:30] direction did he seem to have no
[1:23:32] leadership come on he didn't know where
[1:23:35] he was going all he know that a voice
[1:23:37] was calling him and he was following the
[1:23:39] voice and that's how many of us in our
[1:23:41] Christian Journey came about come on God
[1:23:44] called you I don't know what it was at
[1:23:46] the time but I knew something was
[1:23:48] tugging on something was pulling on my
[1:23:51] heart telling me you don't belong Where
[1:23:53] You Are
[1:23:54] get up and get out of there come on
[1:23:57] something was calling on me oh Jesus
[1:24:00] might didn't know where I was going but
[1:24:03] the Lord was leading you come on and
[1:24:05] there's no greater leadership than God
[1:24:07] himself come on he says didn't know
[1:24:10] where he went by faith he sojourned in
[1:24:13] the land of promise as in a strange
[1:24:16] country dwelling in the Tabernacle with
[1:24:18] Isaac and Jacob and HS with him of the
[1:24:21] same promise for he looked for a city
[1:24:24] which have foundations Hallelujah come
[1:24:27] on how many know this world we living in
[1:24:29] ain't got no
[1:24:31] Foundation come on now ready to break
[1:24:34] apart at any time ain't it come on don't
