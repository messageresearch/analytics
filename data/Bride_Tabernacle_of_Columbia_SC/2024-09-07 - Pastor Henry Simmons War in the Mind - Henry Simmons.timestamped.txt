[34:14] that's going on within your mind amen
[34:18] the wall of the
[34:21] mind it says Romans 8 and5 for they that
[34:26] are after the flesh do mind the things
[34:29] of the flesh but they that are after the
[34:32] spirit the things of the spirit for to
[34:35] be caral minded is what but to be
[34:38] spiritual minded is what
[34:41] life because the caral mind is imity
[34:45] against God it is not subject to the law
[34:47] of God neither indeed can it be so then
[34:50] they that are in the flesh cannot what
[34:53] please God but ye are not in the flesh
[34:57] but in the spirit if so be the spirit of
[35:00] God dwells in you now if any man have
[35:03] not the spirit of Christ he is
[35:07] what and if Christ be in you the body is
[35:11] dead because of sin but the spirit is
[35:15] alive because of
[35:17] righteousness but if the spirit that
[35:21] raises up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[35:24] you he that raised up Christ from the
[35:27] dead
[35:28] shall also what Qui your moral Quicken
[35:32] your mortal bodies by the spirit that
[35:34] dwells in you amen therefore brethren we
[35:38] are dors not to the flesh to live after
[35:40] the flesh for if you live after the
[35:42] flesh you shall what die but if ye
[35:45] through the spirit do mortify the Deeds
[35:47] of the body ye shall what for as many as
[35:50] are led by the spirit of God they are
[35:53] Son of God God bless the re word you may
[35:55] be seated
[35:58] so by the grace of God glad to see s
