[1:19:03] millennials does anybody recognize who's
[1:19:06] who's a millennial in here anybody
[1:19:08] recognize that they are a millennial
[1:19:11] praise the lord my daughter's a
[1:19:13] millennial
[1:19:16] my gracious boy this is good
[1:19:18] participation
[1:19:22] the first the last i just went back 10
[1:19:25] of them
[1:19:27] one of them was called the lost
[1:19:28] generation i don't think i want to be
[1:19:30] there
[1:19:32] all right
[1:19:33] the last
[1:19:34] the next one was the
[1:19:36] inner bellum
[1:19:38] the brain generation i don't think i
[1:19:40] want that
[1:19:42] all right and the next one was the
[1:19:44] greatest and the greatest generation
[1:19:46] started world war one
[1:19:48] so i don't think i want that and the
[1:19:50] next one was the silent generation and
[1:19:52] the silent generation started world war
[1:19:55] ii
[1:19:56] so i don't think i went even either
[1:19:58] there
[1:19:59] the next one was the one unfortunately i
[1:20:01] was born in and it was called the baby
[1:20:03] boomer
[1:20:04] amen
[1:20:05] the next generation was x or baby bust
[1:20:11] the next one was
[1:20:13] zeaniel
[1:20:15] the next one was millennial
[1:20:18] the next one is generation x
[1:20:21] and now
[1:20:23] we are in generation alpha
[1:20:27] we have come back to the beginning
[1:20:30] there is something about that and this
[1:20:32] generation ends in two years
[1:20:35] in 1923
[1:20:38] alpha will be no more they all have the
[1:20:40] next one up
[1:20:42] praise the lord
[1:20:44] did you just feel that anointing that
[1:20:46] just swept through there because
[1:20:47] everybody's starting to realize wait a
[1:20:49] minute we are in a generation that's
[1:20:53] calling their self the beginning
[1:20:56] and there's only one beginning
[1:20:58] is that right i am the alpha i am the
[1:21:02] omega is that right there's only one
[1:21:05] beginning
[1:21:06] praise the lord now
[1:21:08] hang with me today please saints
[1:21:11] now really remember he said here in
[1:21:13] ephesians that it was ages to come he
[1:21:16] would show his enriched grace towards us
[1:21:20] so it wasn't paul said it's not in the
[1:21:23] age i'm standing in that i will see that
[1:21:27] enrichment but it will be an age
[1:21:29] somewhere down the line to where i would
[1:21:33] the god's grace will be enriched
[1:21:36] so pure and so true
[1:21:39] is that right
[1:21:40] i'm here to tell you today i believe
[1:21:42] we've reached that age to where god's
[1:21:45] grace is greater than any
[1:21:48] any age before
[1:21:50] why because it's so much sin
[1:21:53] so much impurity in this world and we
[1:21:56] need god's grace
[1:21:58] and grace always rises to the need of
[1:22:03] the other of the time
[1:22:04] praise the lord a drunk needs a lot of
[1:22:07] grace
[1:22:09] amen some of you church-going kids don't
[1:22:12] need quite as much grace as a drunk does
[1:22:14] but a drunk needs grace and god supplies
[1:22:17] all the grace he ever needs is that
[1:22:20] right
[1:22:21] amen praise the lord
[1:22:23] praise the lord see
[1:22:25] grace
[1:22:28] becomes the power
[1:22:30] that we overcome with
[1:22:33] see satan throws things at us how many
[1:22:36] knows that praise the lord
[1:22:39] y'all quiet
[1:22:41] please help me preach
[1:22:43] please help me preach all right
[1:22:46] how many realizes
[1:22:48] that god's grace is not to and see we've
[1:22:51] got the definitions all messed up of
[1:22:53] grace
[1:22:54] when we use grace nowadays most people
[1:22:56] means compromise
[1:22:59] see
[1:23:01] see they want they they want to be able
[1:23:04] to do whatever they want to do
[1:23:06] and justify it i've got grace
[1:23:10] but that ain't grace
[1:23:12] because the power of god's grace comes
[1:23:15] in your life and he is a very help to
[1:23:19] you
[1:23:20] to overcome whatever god's put whatever
[1:23:24] the devil's put there amen
[1:23:27] praise the lord
[1:23:29] see grace
[1:23:31] is what gives us victory
[1:23:33] romans 6 15 for sin
[1:23:36] shall not
[1:23:38] have dominion over you is that right
[1:23:41] for we're not under the law but we're
[1:23:44] under grace
[1:23:46] grace gives us the victory
[1:23:48] come on say it grace gives victory
[1:23:52] amen praise the lord
[1:23:54] amen see
[1:23:56] he set forth a pattern
[1:23:58] and god
[1:24:00] always
[1:24:01] sets forth patterns
[1:24:03] you know and it's really nice because
[1:24:05] once you find his pattern once you step
[1:24:07] into
[1:24:08] god's pattern
[1:24:10] then then it just you know the next step
[1:24:14] you know the next step you know the next
[1:24:16] step because you're in god's pattern
[1:24:19] see
[1:24:20] see the devil
[1:24:22] he never forms the exact pattern over
[1:24:25] and over and over again
[1:24:27] praise the lord he's got all kinds of
[1:24:29] manipulable things that he me
[1:24:33] there
[1:24:35] my tongue is tired
[1:24:37] i got to get a drink
[1:24:40] all right
[1:24:42] so he manipulates to whatever he wants
[1:24:45] it to be
[1:24:46] is that right he can't create but he
[1:24:49] manipulates
[1:24:51] praise the lord and see with that
[1:24:54] manipulation he then starts blinding
[1:24:57] their eyes to what he's doing
[1:25:01] praise the lord
[1:25:02] and what look good
[1:25:05] is actually bad
[1:25:07] praise the lord so god's got a
[1:25:10] continuity a plan and this is where
[1:25:12] where i want you to follow me see
[1:25:14] god didn't mean to throw any surprises
[1:25:17] with us is that all right
[1:25:19] you know people say wait a minute god it
[1:25:22] sure was a surprise that god moved
[1:25:24] then where was your faith
[1:25:28] where was your faith at
[1:25:30] because if you're surprised you didn't
[1:25:33] believe to begin with
[1:25:37] because faith is the substance that i'm
[1:25:40] holding in my head
[1:25:43] and i refuse to let it go
[1:25:46] amen so we see we
[1:25:49] anybody surprised today of god moving
[1:25:51] then sorry you didn't believe
[1:25:54] but it won't surprise me when he moves
[1:25:57] because i believe he'll move
[1:25:59] amen praise the lord
[1:26:01] see
[1:26:02] so god always used two types of people
[1:26:06] and and
[1:26:07] all through history and i plan on
[1:26:08] proving this
[1:26:10] uh through the word he uses the old to
[1:26:13] lead
[1:26:15] all right
[1:26:16] and unfortunately you young young people
[1:26:19] here
[1:26:20] he always
[1:26:21] uses the young people to bring things to
[1:26:23] pass
[1:26:26] oh
[1:26:27] man i heard them
[1:26:29] on that
[1:26:31] you know well that's good i'm glad you
[1:26:34] um
[1:26:36] you can say amen too if you like
[1:26:38] praise the lord
[1:26:40] see because god
[1:26:42] god realizes that the young the older
[1:26:45] folks we are supposed to be leading the
[1:26:48] young people
[1:26:50] praise the lord that's what's supposed
[1:26:52] to happen is that right
[1:26:54] all through scripture you can see this
[1:26:56] manifested
[1:26:57] all right for example when joshua went
[1:27:00] to spy out the land is that right
[1:27:03] he didn't send a bunch of old fogies
[1:27:05] over there
[1:27:07] come on
[1:27:08] the bible says in joshua 6 23 and the
[1:27:12] young men
[1:27:13] that were spies
[1:27:16] praise the lord how many is a young man
[1:27:20] oh my gration
[1:27:24] come down there
[1:27:27] praise the lord i thought i was going to
[1:27:29] stay up here but i'm going to come down
[1:27:30] there
[1:27:34] let me find one of them fellas that
[1:27:36] didn't raise his hand
[1:27:38] let's start with that guy right there
[1:27:42] you liar
[1:27:44] you're a young man aren't you
[1:27:47] don't tell me you're 59 years old
[1:27:50] come on
[1:27:51] is that true
[1:27:53] no
[1:27:54] so why didn't you raise your hand
[1:27:56] you ashamed of it
[1:27:58] no
[1:27:59] you just couldn't get your hand up hey
[1:28:01] man that thing weighed 25 pounds
[1:28:04] oh
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:13] don't get mad at me
[1:28:15] okay okay
[1:28:18] see
[1:28:19] god sat there and he he chose
[1:28:23] deliberately young men
[1:28:26] hey you think i could have climbed the
[1:28:28] wall
[1:28:32] you know
[1:28:36] but instead who did he choose
[1:28:39] he chose a young man
[1:28:42] and he said the young will go go spy out
[1:28:45] the land
[1:28:47] and come back and give us a report on
[1:28:49] how hard it's going to be to take it
[1:28:53] he depended upon the truthfulness
[1:28:56] of the young man that he said
[1:29:01] he trusted them
[1:29:03] praise the lord
[1:29:05] come on old folks where's our trust
[1:29:08] where's our trust
[1:29:12] man we're afraid to turn a young person
[1:29:14] loose a little bit
[1:29:18] but joshua wasn't afraid
[1:29:20] he said i'll send the young ones
[1:29:22] and don't be truthful and i can depend
[1:29:25] upon them to come back
[1:29:29] praise the lord
[1:29:32] is that right
[1:29:33] praise the lord
[1:29:35] and did they come
[1:29:36] back praise the lord is that right
[1:29:40] see
[1:29:42] see well why not joshua
[1:29:44] because joshua was a young man when
[1:29:48] moses sent him in
[1:29:51] but see
[1:29:52] he couldn't lead
[1:29:54] because he was a young man
[1:29:57] so god let him wander in the wilderness
[1:29:59] for 40 years
[1:30:01] getting some age
[1:30:03] getting some experience
[1:30:06] come on
[1:30:08] so he could lead
[1:30:10] and then god give him young man
[1:30:13] hallelujah so you see how this is
[1:30:16] building
[1:30:17] god's given him young men now
[1:30:20] praise the lord to do the work
[1:30:23] praise the lord
[1:30:24] see
[1:30:25] we've actually done the same thing in
[1:30:27] our household for years

[1:30:33] dad says i ain't doing it
[1:30:36] mom says son
[1:30:38] daughter take out the trash
[1:30:42] come on saints
[1:30:44] we didn't realize we were were
[1:30:46] being like god when we did that did we
[1:30:51] i should have heard a bunch of amens
[1:30:53] from some parents out there somewhere
[1:30:56] sister kylie please say amen

[1:31:00] we didn't know we were
[1:31:02] doing what god did

[1:31:48] hammer
[1:31:50] and he'll pull it right out
[1:31:52] praise the lord amen
[1:31:54] praise the lord now see
[1:31:56] joshua according to what i read
[1:31:59] how old do you think joshua was when he
[1:32:02] was thrown into the pit
[1:32:08] hell

[1:32:39] now if you were picking someone
[1:32:43] to preserve life
[1:32:47] how many of us would have picked a 17
[1:32:49] year old
[1:32:51] come on be truthful
[1:32:54] but god knew
[1:32:57] he needed a young man
[1:33:00] he didn't need somebody that was old he
[1:33:02] didn't need somebody that was
[1:33:04] experienced he needed somebody that was
[1:33:06] tough and rough and could take it
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:12] so he chose what a 17 year old
[1:33:22] throws him in the pit without any water
[1:33:26] is that right
[1:33:28] man i
[1:33:29] see i've done drunk i have a half a a

[1:33:45] because why he's young
[1:33:47] and he's got the experience
[1:33:50] with god
[1:33:51] he don't have the experience in life but
[1:33:54] he has the one that does have the
[1:33:56] experience and that's god
[1:33:59] and he knows him
[1:34:02] see
[1:34:03] and he knows god you must have something
[1:34:06] major in store
[1:34:09] he gets pulled out sold into bondage is

[1:34:52] yeah i know us fellas do it about twice
[1:34:55] as much as you do but you still lust
[1:35:00] and she lost it
[1:35:02] after that young man

[1:35:12] and say come here honey
[1:35:14] i'm gonna teach you some things
[1:35:18] huh
[1:35:21] but he sits there and says ain't no way

[1:35:28] god
[1:35:30] and this is not lawful
[1:35:35] my god's greater than this
[1:35:40] you don't have to cave to those
[1:35:42] temptations
[1:35:45] let me tell you you don't need to end up
[1:35:47] in the back seat of the car or sneaking
[1:35:50] around the house when nobody's home
[1:35:53] praise the lord
[1:35:55] if you knew how many young ladies that
[1:35:59] i've seen weep through at this altars
[1:36:02] through life and then say brother junior
[1:36:05] will you come to my wedding
[1:36:07] and they walk down down all
[1:36:10] in that solid white wedding game
[1:36:13] and i know they're just as pure
[1:36:16] because they received the holy ghost
[1:36:19] when they was 10 years old when they
[1:36:21] were 12 years old when they were 13 16
[1:36:24] 17 years old
[1:36:27] and god preserved them
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:38] praise the lord
[1:36:40] i'm going to tell you some something
[1:36:42] fellas
[1:36:43] there's a light switch that you carry on
[1:36:46] the inside of you
[1:36:48] and once
[1:36:49] you start flip that switch on
[1:36:54] it ain't no cutting it off
[1:36:59] it ain't no cutting it off
[1:37:02] why brother jr because your body is made
[1:37:06] to do that
[1:37:08] praise the lord that's what the bible
[1:37:10] said for this cause shall a man leave
[1:37:13] his father and mother and cleave to his
[1:37:18] and they shall be
[1:37:21] see just like us and god
[1:37:24] just like us and god
[1:37:26] praise the lord we can't have nobody
[1:37:28] else
[1:37:29] is that right
[1:37:30] and if you really have the experience
[1:37:33] you won't want nobody else
[1:37:35] praise the lord
[1:37:37] praise the lord
[1:37:38] see
[1:37:39] so
[1:37:40] so he could have done a lot of things
[1:37:43] but he said he's thrown into prison
[1:37:46] he says they're saying well
[1:37:48] and what what everything his hands god
[1:37:51] bless us
[1:37:54] but wait a minute
[1:37:55] god
[1:37:56] if you're blessed me why ain't i free
[1:37:59] that thought never quickened his mind
[1:38:05] hallelujah
[1:38:07] is that right
[1:38:10] never ever pass his mind
[1:38:12] he said because i'm in the will of god
[1:38:15] god's working it out i can't explain it
[1:38:18] i can't say really what's going on but i
[1:38:21] know this
[1:38:22] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:38:26] today and forever
[1:38:28] is that right if he's a deliverer one
[1:38:31] time
[1:38:32] he has to deliver over and over and over
[1:38:37] and over and over again
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:44] praise the lord
[1:38:46] and see he took
[1:38:48] and he just waited
[1:38:50] deliverance come is that right
[1:38:53] praise the lord and finally he's exalted
[1:38:55] up right next to
[1:38:56] pharaoh you know
[1:38:59] and he's got all of this under control
[1:39:02] and he says oh where's that potiphara
[1:39:05] let me get a hold of him
[1:39:08] huh
[1:39:10] no vengeance
[1:39:15] and christians you adults
[1:39:17] that's supposed to be leading their
[1:39:19] young people
[1:39:21] you hold stuff in your heart
[1:39:24] for years and years and years and it
[1:39:28] raises anger and strife and you don't
[1:39:31] think these young people don't sense
[1:39:33] that
[1:39:35] when somebody's name is mentioned at the
[1:39:37] table and all of a sudden you go sour
[1:39:40] you don't think the young people know
[1:39:42] that
[1:39:45] and you are a leader
[1:39:50] hallelujah
[1:39:53] that 17 year old boy had more
[1:39:55] deliverance than a lot of us
[1:40:01] it got quiet

[1:40:48] that you sold me hither

[1:40:54] to preserve
[1:40:55] life
[1:40:59] oh my
[1:41:01] you young people identifying with this
[1:41:04] praise lord i hate to use the same
[1:41:05] stories over and over again that's been
[1:41:07] said
[1:41:08] with the way the lord moved on me
[1:41:11] so let's take it younger how many how
[1:41:13] many 13 year olds we got
[1:41:15] any 13 year olds we got one back there

[1:41:30] weight's starting to leave hallelujah
[1:41:33] praise the lord
[1:41:35] my gracious
[1:41:39] here's this little girl 13 years old
[1:41:42] she's a young young one in the house and
[1:41:44] guess what
[1:41:46] mary
[1:41:48] yeah mama
[1:41:49] i need water
[1:41:52] yes mama
[1:41:54] sound familiar with any any any young
[1:41:57] people identify that yeah some of you is
[1:42:00] just not in your head thank god
[1:42:03] you know that you can identify with this
[1:42:05] you know
[1:42:06] because here's mary she was nothing but
[1:42:09] a 13 to 14 year old according to history
[1:42:12] but yet guess what
[1:42:15] she was getting ready to have a
[1:42:17] life-altering experience
[1:42:21] is that right
[1:42:23] she goes after the water
[1:42:26] and instead she meets an angel of the
[1:42:29] lord
[1:42:31] who
[1:42:31] starts saying
[1:42:33] nice things about her
[1:42:35] but you know what the problem with
[1:42:38] oh my
[1:42:42] the bible says
[1:42:44] she was troubled
[1:42:46] at his sins
[1:42:49] now does that sound like the bride today
[1:42:53] i have you know i'm the bride of jesus
[1:42:56] christ
[1:43:01] yeah that's right preacher you're
[1:43:02] preaching right about me
[1:43:06] and mary sat there and said
[1:43:08] well wait a minute you know
[1:43:11] i love the lord
[1:43:13] i love the lord
[1:43:17] you know but that's all i can really say
[1:43:19] i love the lord
[1:43:22] it's nothing special about me
[1:43:25] hello
[1:43:27] see she left plenty of room
[1:43:30] for god to reach down
[1:43:33] and lift her up
[1:43:35] she didn't have to lift herself up on
[1:43:38] what she confessed
[1:43:40] god did it for
[1:43:42] if we keep our mouth shut you would see
[1:43:45] what god would really do for us
[1:43:48] and say god i just love you that's all i
[1:43:51] know i love you
[1:43:52] i love you more than anything god
[1:43:59] praise the lord
[1:44:03] see
[1:44:09] mary said
[1:44:11] the angel said
[1:44:12] you're you're going to be endued from
[1:44:14] on high and you're going to you're going
[1:44:16] to
[1:44:17] have a baby in
[1:44:20] mary goes wait a minute
[1:44:23] how is this thing to be
[1:44:27] okay
[1:44:29] because now think about it think about
[1:44:31] it real close
[1:44:32] mary
[1:44:34] was living in prophetic times but there
[1:44:37] was no prophet
[1:44:39] the word always come not through angels
[1:44:43] but through
[1:44:45] prophets
[1:44:46] see she didn't have the revelation yet
[1:44:49] about angels being messengers
[1:44:52] is that right
[1:44:53] and so she's sitting there how can this
[1:44:56] thing be because there's not a prophet
[1:45:00] is god getting ready to send a prophet
[1:45:04] let me tell you something
[1:45:06] when solomon was dedicating the temple
[1:45:11] 12 generations
[1:45:14] approximately 480 years
[1:45:18] after moses
[1:45:20] he refers back to the prophet to moses
[1:45:24] and says
[1:45:25] because of what moses have said
[1:45:28] we rest on that
[1:45:32] that's 480 years roughly if you're
[1:45:35] considering a generation 40 years is
[1:45:37] that right
[1:45:39] the prophet of god has been dead how
[1:45:41] many years 59 years
[1:45:45] and we still can't seem to rest
[1:45:55] and you think your leaders what are you
[1:45:58] teaching your children
[1:46:00] you believe this thing one time and this
[1:46:02] thing the next time and and you can't
[1:46:04] find rest
[1:46:08] but my bible says jesus christ
[1:46:11] i'm sorry brother
[1:46:13] the same
[1:46:17] yesterday
[1:46:18] today
[1:46:20] and forever
[1:46:22] he don't ever change
[1:46:25] hallelujah
[1:46:26] see
[1:46:27] and so
[1:46:29] now she wanted an explanation how's this
[1:46:32] going to happen
[1:46:33] and for the first time the word of god
[1:46:37] didn't come through
[1:46:39] prophetic lips
[1:46:42] it came in spirit form
[1:46:47] is that right
[1:46:48] what we want you to get young people
[1:46:51] the holy ghost
[1:46:53] because the bible says and the angel
[1:46:55] answered and said unto her the holy
[1:46:58] ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:47:01] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:47:04] is that right
[1:47:05] and that child shall be called the son
[1:47:08] of god
[1:47:12] is this all right
[1:47:14] see
[1:47:15] now listen and mary's actions young
[1:47:18] people
[1:47:19] she's 13 years old
[1:47:24] the holy ghost overshadows her
[1:47:27] she might have spoken tongues i don't
[1:47:28] know i wasn't there to listen
[1:47:30] it doesn't matter if she did or didn't
[1:47:33] is that right
[1:47:34] but what does matter
[1:47:36] is something clicked
[1:47:39] and she believed god with all of her
[1:47:41] heart
[1:47:42] and the bible says in that day
[1:47:47] not six months later
[1:47:49] not three months later
[1:47:52] how many of you ladies know what i'm
[1:47:53] getting at
[1:47:55] she didn't feel that first kick
[1:48:00] come on
[1:48:02] she didn't know whether she was or not
[1:48:05] as far as the nature
[1:48:09] but all of a sudden she grabs up herself
[1:48:12] and starts running to elizabeth
[1:48:14] because she knew
[1:48:17] how by faith
[1:48:20] praise the lord
[1:48:23] and you see
[1:48:24] the old leader
[1:48:27] is that right elizabeth
[1:48:30] and the young mary
[1:48:32] coming together
[1:48:35] and now you see the old leader
[1:48:38] needed the young mary
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:42] is that right
[1:48:48] do you get it
[1:48:57] young people the devil comes and says
[1:48:59] you can't do anything
[1:49:02] you're too young
[1:49:03] you too small
[1:49:05] you
[1:49:06] they don't trust you they think you're
[1:49:08] sneaking around behind their backs
[1:49:11] he gives you every reason not to believe
[1:49:14] god
[1:49:16] but that little 13 year old girl did it
[1:49:21] and took deliverance
[1:49:25] to the leader elizabeth
[1:49:29] oh mary
[1:49:31] why did the mother of my god
[1:49:34] come to see me today
[1:49:38] i said not because my child has not
[1:49:41] moved
[1:49:42] and with thy voice i it started kickin
[1:49:55] see the devil is trying everything he
[1:49:57] can
[1:49:59] praise the lord
[1:50:03] just just statistics
[1:50:05] you know we we thought we had passed
[1:50:08] enough law in the united states
[1:50:11] to finally get smoking to where it was
[1:50:13] just it was going out the door
[1:50:16] thank god
[1:50:18] you know
[1:50:24] and some devil
[1:50:26] invented a little thing about that long
[1:50:28] after some of them
[1:50:31] huh
[1:50:33] and it's twice as dangerous as
[1:50:36] cigarettes was
[1:50:40] all right you you won't know some
[1:50:41] statistics this is nine this is 2020 now
[1:50:45] not 2021 or 22 two years ago
[1:50:48] okay
[1:50:50] 30
[1:50:54] of all 10th graders
[1:50:57] was vaping
[1:51:02] 37.5
[1:51:06] in high school
[1:51:07] was vaping
[1:51:11] and what a lot of us parents didn't get
[1:51:14] stick our nose in a book and find out
[1:51:16] was that they don't have to stop
[1:51:20] with nicotine
[1:51:22] because it be it is in a liquid
[1:51:27] come on saints
[1:51:30] and so now what do they do
[1:51:32] they lace it with all kinds of stuff
[1:51:36] opiates fentanyl
[1:51:38] and your kid could be using
[1:51:41] in the next room
[1:51:43] and you'd never know
[1:51:47] hallelujah
[1:51:50] praise the lord one time
[1:51:52] a little
[1:51:54] he was either 11 or 12 years old come to
[1:51:56] me in camp and i probably told this
[1:51:58] before but i'll tell it again because
[1:52:01] he come to me in a prayer line and he
[1:52:03] said brother junior i am addicted to
[1:52:05] pornography i said how can a 11 or 12
[1:52:08] year old child be addicted to
[1:52:10] pornography
[1:52:11] so i went home and stuck myself my nose
[1:52:13] in some books and found out yeah
[1:52:16] it's the worst age to be addicted
[1:52:20] because it takes the normal marital
[1:52:23] relationship completely out of their
[1:52:26] system
[1:52:30] hallelujah
[1:52:32] you boys sitting there watching that
[1:52:34] pornography and stuff you don't know
[1:52:36] what you're doing to your bodies
[1:52:38] because what god intended to be an act
[1:52:42] of intimacy between you and your wife
[1:52:47] is that right
[1:52:49] now has turned into entertainment
[1:52:53] come on
[1:52:55] and you don't look at her as a wife you
[1:52:57] look at her as an object of
[1:53:00] entertainment for you
[1:53:03] hallelujah
[1:53:08] it's quiet
[1:53:12] praise the lord
[1:53:14] but i'm preaching
[1:53:15] this generation
[1:53:18] praise the lord
[1:53:22] and so
[1:53:23] 20
[1:53:25] of all of the high school seniors in
[1:53:27] 1920 went further than nicotine
[1:53:33] 20 of the
[1:53:35] 37.5
[1:53:38] went on past
[1:53:39] nicotine
[1:53:44] praise the lord
[1:53:46] and i tried my best to find
[1:53:50] a sound
[1:53:51] percentage
[1:53:53] of how many children view pornography
[1:53:56] but they said over 65 percent both boys
[1:54:00] and girls included
[1:54:03] by the time they reached senior in high
[1:54:05] school
[1:54:06] has looked at pornography more than once
[1:54:12] i'm giving this to you leaders
[1:54:15] get nosy
[1:54:19] you're leading them
[1:54:20] get nosy
[1:54:23] praise the lord
[1:54:25] is that all right
[1:54:27] see
[1:54:28] my
[1:54:29] see
[1:54:30] god is calling this amen how many
[1:54:33] realizes
[1:54:35] so when god wants to hurt the church
[1:54:39] if you would look over this message
[1:54:42] in its entirety
[1:54:43] you know what what when that brother
[1:54:45] stood up last night and said he has a
[1:54:48] he goes to a church that's young
[1:54:51] that tells me one thing it's a working
[1:54:53] church
[1:54:54] all right
[1:54:56] because young people work
[1:55:00] that's what god's called
[1:55:02] work in the kingdom and vineyard of god
[1:55:06] you know
[1:55:08] a preacher told me the other day he said
[1:55:10] brother i was trying to find a young
[1:55:12] brother that would lead singing for
[1:55:14] these meetings and i couldn't find her
[1:55:17] i said are you kidding me
[1:55:21] god's called you
[1:55:23] young boys to work in the vineyard
[1:55:29] that's why he wants you
[1:55:31] and so he knows
[1:55:34] us leaders are going off the scene
[1:55:39] somebody got to pick up the torch
[1:55:42] and if you don't get the expedience the
[1:55:45] experience now
[1:55:47] while we're still here
[1:55:55] and so
[1:55:57] what does he do he attacks
[1:56:01] the young people
[1:56:04] just go back here's samuel
[1:56:06] come on saints
[1:56:08] dedicated to god is that right
[1:56:11] so satan said i can't touch him
[1:56:14] incidentally
[1:56:16] he was three years old
[1:56:18] he said six he had one six and i've had
[1:56:21] one five
[1:56:22] that's the youngest i've seen
[1:56:24] seen give their heart to god and it take
[1:56:27] it last
[1:56:28] that i know it lasted all right
[1:56:31] you know
[1:56:32] five years old
[1:56:34] his mama was a prostitute
[1:56:36] and was at a camp and would not let him
[1:56:40] come and pray
[1:56:43] oh but thank god
[1:56:46] he comes running up pulling my britches
[1:56:48] leg crying and i think he's hurt
[1:56:50] but oh my
[1:56:52] when i've been down i said what's wrong
[1:56:54] buddy where'd you get hurt at he said
[1:56:56] i'm not hurt
[1:56:57] i just wanted to meet jesus mama
[1:56:59] wouldn't let me come
[1:57:01] is it too late
[1:57:03] i said son it's never too late
[1:57:13] samuel was three
[1:57:15] dedicated to god
[1:57:18] is that right
[1:57:20] but eli had two sons
[1:57:25] and god said the reproach
[1:57:29] that i can bring through those two boys
[1:57:33] when two preachers boys gets gets in
[1:57:35] trouble
[1:57:36] oh wow you're right
[1:57:40] now listen closely
[1:57:43] first samuel 2 17 if you need to write
[1:57:46] it down
[1:57:47] wherefore the sin of the young man
[1:57:51] talking about eli's sons
[1:57:52] was very great before the lord
[1:57:56] four men or for eli's sons abhorred
[1:58:00] the offerings
[1:58:02] of the lord
[1:58:05] did anybody just ring home
[1:58:09] and this is i'm going to come down for a
[1:58:11] few minutes
[1:58:13] because this makes me almost want to
[1:58:14] weep and cry
[1:58:17] because
[1:58:18] i never looked at it this way before
[1:58:23] jesus christ we're not supposed to know
[1:58:26] anything but jesus christ and him
[1:58:28] crucified is that right
[1:58:30] right
[1:58:31] he is our sacrifice is that right
[1:58:35] every drop of blood that was shed
[1:58:39] for us was shed that day is that right
[1:58:43] there's nobody shedding any more blood
[1:58:46] come on saints
[1:58:48] and so as you as young people
[1:58:52] that sits there
[1:58:54] and says you know what brother
[1:58:58] i don't want
[1:59:00] any part of that sacrifice
[1:59:07] i'll decline
[1:59:09] that sacrifice
[1:59:11] matter of fact i hate what it does to me
[1:59:19] wow
[1:59:24] then how in the world can you look at
[1:59:26] god
[1:59:28] because you're abhorring
[1:59:31] god's own sacrifice young people
[1:59:36] do you see what the devil has done
[1:59:40] when we are needing you
[1:59:43] the most that we've ever needed you in
[1:59:45] our lives
[1:59:49] god has come
[1:59:51] and started making you reject
[1:59:54] what he's done for you on the cross
[1:59:59] i don't believe brother jr that all of
[2:00:02] my sins can be forgiven
[2:00:08] is that preaching
[2:00:10] is that the word god was angry at them
[2:00:14] not because they were stealing
[2:00:17] but because
[2:00:18] they wouldn't respect what he was doing
[2:00:21] through the sacrifice
[2:00:31] here we are
[2:00:32] we're needing young people
[2:00:36] and you're sitting stiff
[2:00:39] won't even reach your hands
[2:00:42] and we're saying god we need young
[2:00:44] people because soon we'll walk off the
[2:00:47] face of this earth
[2:00:49] and we will go on and meet our maker
[2:00:53] and somebody's got to carry the work
[2:00:55] until the rapture takes place
[2:00:58] we need them
[2:01:00] and they're setting rejecting what
[2:01:02] you've done for them on the cross
[2:01:10] oh my
[2:01:12] that's all right you can tighten up if
[2:01:14] you want to
[2:01:15] it's still the truth
[2:01:20] it's still the truth
[2:01:22] see
[2:01:25] because see god
[2:01:27] through that cross
[2:01:29] we received something
[2:01:32] we received an inheritance
[2:01:39] and to the emphasis
[2:01:41] when paul
[2:01:43] was preaching the gospel
[2:01:44] the cross
[2:01:46] meant
[2:01:47] one thing
[2:01:49] come on saints
[2:01:51] and then it comes down through time is
[2:01:53] that right
[2:01:55] and we hit luther and wesley
[2:01:57] and then we walk into this last age 1906
[2:02:01] on azusa street
[2:02:05] the power of god did fall
[2:02:07] is that right
[2:02:10] and now
[2:02:11] it's time for us to pick up our
[2:02:14] inheritance
[2:02:17] because he's promised
[2:02:19] in a day
[2:02:23] that we
[2:02:25] could receive
[2:02:28] great
[2:02:30] grace
[2:02:32] is that right
[2:02:34] come on saints
[2:02:38] but instead
[2:02:39] we're busy saying
[2:02:41] i really don't need it
[2:02:43] i'm doing all right
[2:02:45] god understands
[2:02:54] two girls walked up to me
[2:02:57] oh my
[2:03:02] and like i said some of my stories i
[2:03:04] repeat because they they make sense
[2:03:08] i got a whole bunch of them but these
[2:03:10] are the ones that stick out to me
[2:03:12] that moved in my heart that made me cry
[2:03:15] and weep before god
[2:03:17] two girls walked up to me and said my
[2:03:19] mom and dad said that
[2:03:22] they would abide by your decision
[2:03:25] you know and i thought i didn't say it i
[2:03:28] kept my mouth shut
[2:03:29] thank god
[2:03:31] every once in a while i can't keep it
[2:03:32] shut
[2:03:35] but i thought i said why in the world
[2:03:37] are you asking you having your kids
[2:03:39] asking me
[2:03:41] you're the leader
[2:03:43] you're the one
[2:03:45] but see they were wanting to shove it
[2:03:47] off on somebody else
[2:03:50] come on
[2:03:51] don't you ever do that
[2:03:54] if you don't know the answer get down on
[2:03:56] your knees
[2:03:58] and pray until god gives you the answer
[2:04:01] and those young people will respect that
[2:04:05] and so here he comes
[2:04:08] we want to go see an r-rated movie
[2:04:12] and a lot of the other churches
[2:04:14] i mean a lot of the other kids at the
[2:04:16] church are going
[2:04:17] and we'd like to go to
[2:04:23] i said girls you're going to be
[2:04:24] extremely sorry that you come and ask me
[2:04:29] you have no business
[2:04:34] praise the lord that's the house of the
[2:04:36] devil
[2:04:41] see
[2:04:42] i've got an advantage over some of y'all
[2:04:44] my dad at the end of world war ii he was
[2:04:47] a light infant uh light artillery man he
[2:04:50] he operated a 30 caliber machine gun at
[2:04:54] the end of world war ii
[2:04:56] god saved him god blessed him to get
[2:04:57] through it and so at the end of world
[2:04:59] war ii what he became was a
[2:05:02] projectionist because all of the they
[2:05:06] would the united states had all kinds of
[2:05:08] films over to entertain the soldiers
[2:05:10] while while they were waiting for
[2:05:12] shipment coming back over
[2:05:14] so my dad became a projectionist all
[2:05:16] right and so he operated the movies you
[2:05:20] know
[2:05:21] and so
[2:05:23] he one day
[2:05:25] the movie projector goofed up and he
[2:05:27] started looking at the strip
[2:05:29] and right towards the end of the strip
[2:05:32] all of a sudden he started looking
[2:05:36] and there was this incredible
[2:05:38] cold
[2:05:39] i mean with with water running off the
[2:05:42] side of it
[2:05:43] glass
[2:05:45] a coke
[2:05:48] you know
[2:05:49] and so he he went a couple more little
[2:05:52] things there it is again
[2:05:54] then he goes again
[2:05:57] so
[2:05:59] he calls or writes somebody and says hey
[2:06:02] what's that doing on there
[2:06:04] he said oh
[2:06:06] that's
[2:06:07] suggestive
[2:06:09] selling
[2:06:11] you don't even see them come by your
[2:06:13] eyes
[2:06:16] come on saints
[2:06:19] you go into that thing and look at that
[2:06:21] movie
[2:06:22] you don't know what's passing by your
[2:06:24] eyes
[2:06:26] that your brain is registering
[2:06:31] and they told dad that the cells of
[2:06:34] drinks at intermission
[2:06:36] doubled when they put that on the end of
[2:06:38] tapes
[2:06:41] hallelujah
[2:06:43] are y'all getting tired
[2:06:46] man i ain't even halfway through notes
[2:06:49] are y'all getting tired young people are
[2:06:51] you getting tired say it
[2:06:53] well thank god i got one young people's
[2:06:56] i hope he ain't lying praise the lord
[2:06:59] see we are we are based ourself we've
[2:07:03] got this inheritance that is due us
[2:07:07] through the power of the cross
[2:07:11] okay but the problem is
[2:07:14] you got to come to the cross
[2:07:18] to get it
[2:07:20] and you know you can't start off
[2:07:23] shouting and dancing
[2:07:27] you know
[2:07:29] young people you're a sponge
[2:07:32] old people you're a sponge and whatever
[2:07:35] atmosphere you get in you will sup it up
[2:07:43] is that right
[2:07:46] so first of all you've got to break out
[2:07:49] of that atmosphere that you're in
[2:07:52] because you ain't in a clean atmosphere
[2:07:55] your mind ain't clean
[2:07:57] come on
[2:07:59] your heart ain't clean
[2:08:02] and you've got to break out of that and
[2:08:05] come to the foot of the cross
[2:08:09] where you will receive
[2:08:11] the cleansing is that right
[2:08:15] of the blood of jesus christ amen
[2:08:18] which gives you
[2:08:20] now
[2:08:23] the potential
[2:08:25] to redeem
[2:08:27] your inheritance
[2:08:29] but first before i go any further
[2:08:32] any everybody understands an inheritance
[2:08:34] right praise the lord
[2:08:38] man i keep looking in the paper you know
[2:08:42] they print inheritances that haven't
[2:08:43] been claimed
[2:08:45] and i just know one of these days
[2:08:47] there's going to be hassel woosley jr
[2:08:51] somebody left me a whole bunch of money
[2:08:57] see
[2:08:58] because all the time
[2:09:00] people receive inheritance and never
[2:09:03] know they received them
[2:09:07] and so a lot of us a lot of you young
[2:09:09] people has made that trip to this altar
[2:09:13] and you pleaded the blood
[2:09:16] but you didn't know that there was an
[2:09:18] inheritance that came with that
[2:09:21] yes sir
[2:09:23] because how many realizes the blood by
[2:09:25] itself is nice
[2:09:28] but without the power that is in the
[2:09:30] blood we don't have a lot
[2:09:36] because then it's just like a bull
[2:09:40] you know
[2:09:41] two total of us
[2:09:43] but see god sits there and he give us
[2:09:46] the power
[2:09:53] don't deny it
[2:09:55] receive it
[2:09:57] because let me tell you what's in store
[2:10:01] when you finally come to that place
[2:10:04] oh wait a minute there's an inheritance
[2:10:06] waiting for me i want it
[2:10:09] how many realizes he said i won't leave
[2:10:11] you comfortless
[2:10:12] i will send the comforter
[2:10:16] anybody ever look that up in the greek
[2:10:19] i know this is this is
[2:10:21] not normal youth message but i'm hoping
[2:10:24] i'm getting down every all all of them
[2:10:26] is getting a little bit
[2:10:28] the greek on that is not
[2:10:31] i'm so sorry
[2:10:34] because that's the way most people read
[2:10:36] it
[2:10:39] but it's intercessor
[2:10:42] it's someone that goes instead of you
[2:10:57] god's grace
[2:11:01] he says the first thing i'm going to do
[2:11:03] is i'm going to block
[2:11:05] god's judgment
[2:11:13] anybody feel the presence of god
[2:11:17] the first thing i'm going to do is i'm
[2:11:19] going to say hey
[2:11:21] god i
[2:11:23] he says i'll block the judgment for god
[2:11:27] because i'll place the blood in front of
[2:11:29] you
[2:11:32] you have formed a union
[2:11:35] how many understands
[2:11:37] i'm going to a quote right now
[2:11:39] god has formed a union jesus christ and
[2:11:42] foreign union with you and because of
[2:11:44] that union
[2:11:46] he won't kill himself
[2:11:51] he'll plead the blood for you
[2:11:54] enrich grace
[2:11:56] enrich grace
[2:11:58] [Applause]
[2:12:00] praise the lord
[2:12:01] y'all done quiet
[2:12:04] are you listening
[2:12:08] see
[2:12:10] because the promises to you
[2:12:13] and who
[2:12:16] we've got another promise
[2:12:20] and to our children
[2:12:27] you see this little book marker right
[2:12:28] here
[2:12:31] god dealt with me
[2:12:33] and i'll make a long story short
[2:12:37] finally it took god's speaking to me
[2:12:39] three or four times to finally get the
[2:12:41] direction of what to do with this i
[2:12:43] ordered two of them at a time from from
[2:12:45] the voice of god
[2:12:47] and i'm not a big voice of god order but
[2:12:49] but
[2:12:50] god god just quickened in my heart and i
[2:12:52] ordered to him
[2:12:56] and
[2:12:57] on mother's day this year
[2:12:59] the last thing we did before we
[2:13:01] dismissed
[2:13:03] i brought my wife down i've got two boys
[2:13:06] that's wayward
[2:13:08] but the promise is to me
[2:13:14] is that right
[2:13:18] and i said mom i didn't know what to get
[2:13:21] you for you for mother's day
[2:13:24] so i'm gonna give you your two boys
[2:13:27] all right
[2:13:29] my oldest son
[2:13:31] i haven't talked to in over 12 years
[2:13:37] three weeks later i'm at the church
[2:13:39] doing paperwork
[2:13:41] the phone rings and i look cooper at the
[2:13:43] caller id
[2:13:45] paul woosley
[2:13:49] and since then
[2:13:50] he's called he's texted
[2:13:59] i have a promise
[2:14:02] and i let the devil deny me
[2:14:06] [Applause]
[2:14:10] god give me this inheritance
[2:14:14] praise the lord
[2:14:16] see
[2:14:19] ephesians 1 10 that in the
[2:14:22] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[2:14:24] might gather together in one all things
[2:14:27] in christ
[2:14:28] both of which are in heaven and which
[2:14:30] are on earth
[2:14:32] in whom also we have obtained an
[2:14:34] inheritance
[2:14:36] being predestinated according to the
[2:14:39] purpose of him who works all things
[2:14:42] after the council of his own will
[2:14:45] god's desire
[2:14:47] to place
[2:14:49] his word
[2:14:51] inside of us
[2:14:53] is that right
[2:14:55] why
[2:14:58] brother brother jr didn't paul have word
[2:15:01] yeah he had word
[2:15:04] but the word wasn't fully restored
[2:15:07] is that right
[2:15:09] and it went all through the ages
[2:15:12] but in this last time god
[2:15:14] has given us
[2:15:16] grace
[2:15:18] see we couldn't control it without god's
[2:15:21] grace
[2:15:22] is that right
[2:15:24] and so what does he give us for an
[2:15:26] inheritance of people why can you look
[2:15:29] if this morning you won't deny that
[2:15:31] sacrifice
[2:15:33] and you accept him what can you look
[2:15:36] forward to
[2:15:39] praise the lord
[2:15:40] i'm just going through my notes i know
[2:15:42] it's going to sound choppy
[2:15:44] is that all right
[2:15:46] see
[2:15:47] because he's longing to bring you
[2:15:51] to this point
[2:15:54] i can
[2:15:56] you know a lot of people think god's
[2:15:58] just sitting somewhere
[2:16:00] i don't know how many of y'all still be
[2:16:02] able to see me or not but god's just
[2:16:04] sitting somewhere relaxed saying
[2:16:06] well i'll get excited about the rapture
[2:16:09] when that time comes
[2:16:12] i believe he's sitting on the edge of
[2:16:14] his seat
[2:16:16] i believe he's looking for the very
[2:16:18] second
[2:16:19] to appear when we're ready
[2:16:23] a prophet of god told me
[2:16:25] we were holding him back
[2:16:32] verla verily i say unto you
[2:16:35] he that believeth on me
[2:16:38] the
[2:16:39] works
[2:16:40] that i do
[2:16:41] shall he do also

[2:20:37] more and more i hang around young people
[2:20:39] one of the problems that we have when we
[2:20:42] put groups of young people together
[2:20:44] as pictures
[2:20:46] start circulating
[2:20:48] and i ain't talking about
[2:20:50] happy pictures
[2:20:54] and you gotta trail them down
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:21:00] and you try to get somebody
[2:21:02] around this computer
[2:21:04] savvy enough to delete
[2:21:06] the file
[2:21:08] [Music]
[2:21:11] why is that happening brother jr because
[2:21:14] our young people are lucky
[2:21:15] [Music]
[2:21:22] and we're not supplying the god
[2:21:25] that they need to look to
[2:21:27] [Music]

[2:21:35] you please forgive me
[2:21:37] but i've preached my heart
[2:21:43] [Music]
[2:21:48] we love the child and we love the dance
[2:21:52] but parents
[2:21:54] you don't get them to go out shouting
[2:21:56] and dancing i'm afraid
[2:22:00] it takes that long prayer life
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:09] some of us would say
[2:22:12] i ain't prayed for my young people more
[2:22:13] than 10 minutes this week
[2:22:17] but yet you're expecting them to come
[2:22:19] through the door
[2:22:21] you're expecting them to walk up here
[2:22:23] and give their life to god
[2:22:25] [Music]
[2:22:26] but wait a minute little johnny you've
[2:22:28] got a ball game and it's church night

[2:22:42] that that ball game
[2:22:43] is way more important
[2:22:46] than jesus christ

[2:40:52] but for the holy ghost to fall
[2:40:55] you know we love to see the

[2:41:04] would have no wise turned down
[2:41:06] when the tears start coming down
[2:41:09] i believe that when the tears start
[2:41:11] coming down
[2:41:12] something down touched down on the
[2:41:14] inside it went past the flesh
[2:41:18] and the spirit but something down
[2:41:19] reached the soul
[2:41:21] and i pray that this morning
[2:41:24] that we can take that
[2:41:26] what we've heard and
[2:41:28] what we received what we felt and built
[2:41:30] to build upon it amen
[2:41:33] you know i i like to
[2:41:35] reiterate something that brother woosley
[2:41:37] said this morning and
[2:41:38] he was talking about the older ministers
[2:41:41] going off the scene
[2:41:42] and i was just speaking to brother larry
[2:41:44] this morning

[2:42:02] you'll realize
[2:42:04] how much we needed those oldest
[2:42:05] ministers
[2:42:07] how much we needed those
