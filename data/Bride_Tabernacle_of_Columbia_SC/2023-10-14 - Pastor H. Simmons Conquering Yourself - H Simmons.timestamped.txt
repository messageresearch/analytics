[35:44] amen God is good
[35:47] amen the Book of James just the fourth
[35:51] chapter and six verse
[35:55] James
[35:59] just feel led in the midst of the water
[36:01] that taking place over in Israel we know
[36:04] that Israel is our time pieace and we
[36:08] know
[36:10] that when the Gentile days are finished
[36:14] God will return back to the
[36:16] Jews and we're close to that
[36:22] time
[36:25] says
[36:27] James uh 4 and
[36:30] six but he giveth more grace wherefore
[36:34] he said God resisteth the what proud
[36:37] proud and giveth grace to the what
[36:40] submit yourselves therefore to God
[36:43] resist what and he will what is that
[36:49] right Draw N to God and he would
[36:52] what clean your hands ye Sinners and puf
[36:56] ify your heart you double minded be
[36:59] afflicted and moan weak let your
[37:02] laughter be turned into mourning and
[37:04] your joy in the heaven is humble
[37:08] what in the sight of the Lord and He
[37:11] what God bless the read of his word you
[37:14] may be seated if you want God to lift
[37:17] you
[37:18] up we we come to places in our lives
[37:22] that as we said many times our greatest
[37:26] enemy is our ourselves
[37:29] right and um because we seem
[37:34] to sometimes deceive
[37:39] ourselves then we begin to lose the
[37:42] victory we must conquer
[37:45] ourselves let me just ve off to he
[37:49] saying that I said on Tuesday night uh
[37:53] we had quite a number here Tuesday night
[37:55] and I said on last night in Mullins you
[37:59] know
[38:00] where the church ought to be packed and
[38:02] people on the knees crying out
[38:05] because you know one of the national
[38:09] people got on the uh television on the
[38:12] Internet or whatever and says we're at
[38:15] the end of the
[38:17] world and it looks like it if it's ever
[38:20] been a time it looks like we're at the
[38:21] end of the world that the chaos that is
[38:24] taking place in Ukraine and then over in
[38:28] Israel Israel is the time piece now if
[38:31] God began to deal with Israel deal with
[38:34] the Jews we talking about the Great
[38:36] Tribulation period Then There was
[38:38] talking about two prophets coming on the
[38:40] scene Moses and Elijah in Revelation
[38:43] 11th chapter right and if they come on
[38:46] the scene and you'll still here that
[38:48] means one
[38:50] thing you missed the
[38:54] Rapture and the Bible say says there'll
[38:57] be 10 virgin five wise and five what
[39:01] foolish the difference between the wise
[39:03] and the foolish the wise had what they
[39:07] had the Holy
[39:08] Ghost the others thought they they had
[39:11] enough or they had some o but not
[39:15] enough are you with me they all what ran
[39:21] out are you with me the tribulation
[39:25] period is right here before for us the
[39:27] world can't stand too much more the
[39:30] earthquakes and all the stuff that's
[39:32] happening the world this Earth can't
[39:34] stand too much more it's in its birth
[39:38] pains so let me just pause for from
[39:43] conquering yourself because it's time
[39:47] that if you're not concerned about your
[39:50] own Eternal
[39:53] Destiny then who's going to be concerned
[39:56] about
[39:58] I thought about my life and I said you
[40:00] know every up down and all my mistakes
[40:05] and all my failures I said God was
[40:07] always there even when I

[40:53] hand I got to trust you with everything
[40:56] thing I got to trust you with my life I
[40:58] can't trust myself because I'm a
[41:01] failure so I got to trust
[41:04] God Amen and conquering yourself you got
[41:07] to humble
[41:09] yourself amen and let God what lift you
[41:13] up but we're so uh so much concerned
[41:17] about ourselves to
[41:20] ourselves amen we we actually defeat
[41:23] ourselves by trying amen to uh
[41:28] help
[41:31] ourselves David said I will lift my eyes
[41:34] to the
[41:35] heels from whence
[41:38] cometh my help my Help
[41:42] Cometh From The Lord amen Lord the Lord
[41:47] the Lord is my
[41:49] helper amen I I got to trust him to help
[41:53] me I can't help myself but God is my
[41:59] helper that's why David said the Lord is
[42:02] my light in my salvation Whom Shall I
[42:06] Fear the Lord is
[42:08] the strength of my life amen I'm
[42:12] dependent on God what about you amen
[42:15] amen I I I oh my life is in his hand
[42:20] amen but you got to realize amen that
[42:24] you are defeated you the devil will amen
[42:27] uh oh destroy
[42:30] you praise God you don't have enough
[42:33] strength to battle the demon forces amen
[42:38] that's out there in the
[42:39] world and you have an aary the adversary
[42:43] the devil as a roaring lion he goes to
[42:46] and fr seeking whom he may devour the
[42:50] devil wants to devour you amen but it's
[42:53] the grace of God that keeps you amen
[42:56] God's grace upon your life God's mercy
[43:00] every time I hear about somebody just
[43:02] had an
[43:03] accident brother Jim's brother he had an
[43:06] accident and was in the hospital for
[43:08] about a week and he
[43:10] died I said what's keeping uh you from
[43:14] just walking out here getting in the car
[43:16] driving down the road and yet somebody
[43:19] just come and hit you or
[43:24] whatever brother was telling me a deer
[43:27] jumped on his
[43:29] car that deer could have took him
[43:31] out are you with me anything could
[43:34] happen any time that could take you out
[43:36] I thought about it when he said that I
[43:38] said that could have been his life it
[43:39] messed up his nice car which was almost
[43:41] paid for
[43:46] but but he he was all right but that
[43:49] same accident could have been that that
[43:52] deer amen that almost to probably total
[43:56] lost his car could have total lost his
[43:59] life but that was God's grace is't that
[44:01] right so I'm saying to you Amen to
[44:05] conquer yourself is to save
[44:07] yourself now in Acts uh uh two acts two
[44:14] please galeb way up there now acts
[44:21] two ear as you right there you can got
[44:24] to pull up
[44:27] Acts 2
[44:29] and the Bible says acts
[44:32] 238 acts 238 it says then Peter said
[44:35] unto them
[44:38] what repent the problem is we're talking
[44:41] about conquering yourself then you see
[44:44] what happened the Jews had taken and by
[44:46] Wicked hand They Crucified and they
[44:48] killed the
[44:50] Lord are you with me now the Jews over
[44:53] there they looking for the Messiah to
[44:55] come but he's already come but they
[44:57] didn't know it the Bible tells us in
[44:59] Romans 9 blindness in part on Romans 11
[45:03] blindness in part as it happened to
[45:05] Israel and to the fullness of the
[45:08] Gentiles Romans 11 see it's a time
[45:11] appointed that God says amen Gentile
[45:14] Days Are Over amen I'm moving on to the
[45:18] Jews amen so the Jews were recognized as
[45:22] Joseph Brothers amen persecuted Joseph
[45:25] right and Joseph was a type of Christ
[45:27] isn't that right so when Joseph set at
[45:30] the right hand of pharaoh amen and Jesus
[45:32] set at the right hand of God isn't that
[45:34] right but his his brothers amen the
[45:37] Bible say Jesus came to his own in his
[45:39] own what s right so the Jews amen was
[45:43] blinded for to to let us
[45:47] in God blinded
[45:50] them
[45:53] amen so we we we we in the position that
[45:56] we in amen that God's one day is going
[45:59] to uh uh let Joseph Brothers recognize
[46:03] who he
[46:05] is
[46:06] amen God Amen blinded your eyes but one
[46:10] day Joseph going to tell his brothers
[46:12] hey I'm Joseph and one day they're going
[46:15] to look at the hands of him them whom
[46:18] they
[46:19] pierc are you with me and they're going
[46:22] to recognize Jesus as
[46:24] Messiah are you with me amen he's oh God
[46:29] but the Jews until this day they're
[46:31] fighting to hold on to Jerusalem because
[46:34] everywhere they went throughout the
[46:35] world Amen they they they have been
[46:39] persecuted so in 1948 Ezekiel 37 said
[46:44] Can these bones
[46:46] live amen 37 amen and he said Lord God
[46:50] thou knowest he said prophesy to the
[46:54] bones and say oh you you dry bones hear
[46:56] the word of the Lord amen are you with
[46:59] me and the bones began to come
[47:02] together are you with me so Israel which
[47:06] was dead and just dried up and looked
[47:09] like there was hopeless but God said
[47:11] Israel was going to return to be a
[47:14] nation be born in one day are you with
[47:17] me and in 1948 they they flew the flag
[47:22] and the United Nation recogniz it but in
[47:24] 46 the prophet brother brandham said God
[47:27] recognized Israel had come back in 46
[47:30] and God gave him a Ministry of healing
[47:33] Divine Healing to go to the world Amen
[47:36] as a gift of God to get the Gentile
[47:39] bride ready for the
[47:41] Rapture are you with me but the gift of
[47:45] healing was only to amen cast the
[47:47] attention of
[47:49] people are you with me amen so God in
[47:52] this last day has given us a message
[47:56] to the Gentile Church to get a bride
[47:58] ready for
[47:59] Rapture are you with me why everybody
[48:02] else going to church and doesn't don't
[48:04] know what's happening you as the elect
[48:08] of God not just as the church go but as
[48:10] the elect of God Amen as amen that God
[48:14] chose you and him before the foundation
[48:16] of the world so God said he spoke to the
[48:19] rest of them in Parables but it's given
[48:22] un you to know the mysteries of the
[48:24] Kingdom amen are you
[48:26] so God Amen as you being elect of God is
[48:30] nothing that you've done because you
[48:32] were a part of God before the foundation
[48:34] of the world just like you were a part
[48:36] of your great great granddaddy you were
[48:38] a part of
[48:40] God are you with me and God saw you
[48:44] coming before you got here God saw you
[48:47] coming and God knew the one day you
[48:50] would hear the truth of the word and you
[48:52] would recognize Jesus Christ died for
[48:55] your sins
[48:56] am are you with me and when you
[48:59] recognize there something that that was
[49:01] German in in your heart it was it it
[49:04] would Quicken your spirit and the power
[49:07] of God would take over amen and
[49:10] something will illuminate you and you
[49:13] said I know Jesus is my Lord I know he
[49:17] died for my sin and conviction set
[49:22] in if conviction never sets in
[49:26] if you say well I accept you as my
[49:29] savior no
[49:31] conviction but when you when it's
[49:34] real when it's real you humble yourself
[49:38] real power is to humble yourself real
[49:41] power you want amen real powers to be
[49:44] able to be humble enough to say Lord you
[49:48] died for my sin Lord I'm a sinner I'm no
[49:51] good I'm rich and I'm
[49:53] undone I need you Lord am I'm born in
[49:57] sin shaper in
[49:59] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[50:01] I need
[50:03] God I need help save me Lord Save Me
[50:08] Lord deliver me God help me I need
[50:13] help but if we don't see ourselves as
[50:16] Sinners amen all we want to do see
[50:18] ourselves as Church person and joining
[50:20] some church and going with some
[50:22] organized religion you know the Catholic
[50:24] church was a mother of organized
[50:27] religion and every
[50:29] organized
[50:31] uh uh religion is the daughters of the
[50:34] mother holl Revelation
[50:36] 17 are you with me and God says come out
[50:40] of her my people come out of mystery
[50:44] babon are you with me what do he want
[50:47] you to come out for to come out of her
[50:49] to come back to the

[51:05] Jesus Christ he's the word the Bible
[51:08] said in the beginning was the word the
