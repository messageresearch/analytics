[17:36] amen this time we're going to go to the
[17:38] remarks uh
[17:39] two minutes please we start with brother
[17:40] gerald murray
[17:42] then followed by kimone smith
[17:46] then mr sharon baker
[17:50] and pastor aaron bishop amen
[18:00] praise the lord saints um we thank god
[18:03] for this
[18:05] this um gratitude for expressing the
[18:06] life of our brother derrick here
[18:09] and um brother there was like a big
[18:11] brother to me
[18:12] and a good friend of mines he was he was
[18:15] down to earth
[18:16] didn't say that much he's full of wisdom
[18:20] and just by looking at him you would
[18:22] think that he didn't have no wisdom
[18:23] though but
[18:24] once you start talking to him you found
[18:26] out that he had a lot of wisdom
[18:28] and um he didn't he didn't mind
[18:30] importing that wisdom
[18:32] to anybody who's willing to listen and
[18:34] um
[18:35] i learned a lot from him like i said he
[18:37] was very easy going
[18:39] laid back but serious whenever he need
[18:41] to be
[18:43] and um like i said um
[18:47] it's kind of hard standing up here
[18:48] though but you know
[18:50] one of his last well one of his requests
[18:53] was was for me of all people
[18:54] to get up here and um to um
[18:58] speak over him but i said well
[19:01] about to just step up to the plate and
[19:03] you know for a friend
[19:05] and a brother yeah i'll go ahead and go
[19:08] for it um
[19:10] one of the main things that really
[19:13] impressed me about brother derek was he
[19:16] had a very
[19:17] interesting laughter laugh
[19:20] and no matter if he was down and out
[19:23] busted disgusted can't be trusted
[19:26] broke as a joke when he whenever he
[19:29] would laugh
[19:30] if that didn't pick you up nothing would
[19:34] so um brother derrick's
[19:39] he never complained about anything and
[19:41] one of his favorite terminology was um
[19:44] one day at a time one day at a time even
[19:47] with his medical conditions
[19:49] he never you know whined or cried about
[19:51] it and you would never know that he was
[19:53] going through
[19:54] what he was going through but you know
[19:56] he just
[19:59] you know just handled it like a soldier
[20:03] and we thank god for that and um
[20:07] oh one more thing too i remembered um
[20:12] another thing that really stood out to
[20:14] me was was um
[20:15] one time me and sister lisa we was
[20:17] having like a long conversation i i
[20:19] can't remember whether it was
[20:21] outside or over the phone but
[20:25] it was getting pretty deep and brother
[20:27] there he kept going
[20:28] interjecting his thoughts boom boom boom
[20:31] and since at least the first time i ever
[20:33] heard her get mad in
[20:35] all my years she was like um
[20:38] be quiet brother derek i'm trying to
[20:40] hear what brother gerald say
[20:42] and there was like silence and i was
[20:44] like oh lord what's going to happen now
[20:47] but brother derek was like
[20:49] whoa well baby you know i'm just trying
[20:51] to interject the things i know
[20:53] and sister elise was like i know hon i
[20:56] love you though
[20:58] so i said brother derek you handle that
[21:01] like a champ boom
[21:03] but um to sum it up though
[21:06] brother derek loved the lord with all of
[21:09] his heart
[21:10] and he didn't mind expressing it to
[21:12] anybody or
[21:13] everywhere that he went no matter who he
[21:16] met
[21:16] on a job at a grocery store in church
[21:20] outside of church he didn't mind um
[21:22] sharing his love for
[21:24] for god and um that was one of the main
[21:27] things that really impressed me about
[21:29] him he wasn't ashamed
[21:31] of the gospel and um you know thank god
[21:34] for him
[21:51] um i watched my daddy transform
[21:58] to a man when i was a kid
[22:01] and i gonna never forget
[22:04] my daddy put it back in my hand
[22:08] and he told me go out and give
[22:10] everything you got
[22:15] it takes a lot for me to stand up here
[22:18] because my daddy went perfect he didn't
[22:20] have to be perfect
[22:21] he just wanted me to be the best i can
[22:24] be
[22:28] he had this slogan holding the road
[22:35] when his nights were dark and his days
[22:37] were dark he's still held in the road
[22:40] when he was going through his condition
[22:43] he still held it in the road
[22:46] and he's looking down at all of us right
[22:48] now
[22:50] holding the rope
[22:54] and i promise and i appreciate everybody
[22:59] my daddy was a good man
[23:21] praise the lord everybody
[23:25] my name is sharan baker and i work with
[23:28] mr johnson
[23:30] um he worked at mentor for 13 years
[23:34] and i've known him for five of the 13. i
[23:37] was his program director
[23:39] and when they asked me would i come
[23:43] and represent where he worked
[23:46] i took it as an honor because
[23:49] he gave so much he gave everything that
[23:52] he had
[23:53] he carried many titles you know some
[23:56] called him mr johnson
[23:58] some called him dad some called him pop
[24:02] some called him a friend i called him a
[24:04] friend
[24:05] um because it didn't matter what
[24:08] situation was going on or
[24:10] what we had going on and not within our
[24:12] agency
[24:14] he always came with some nice spirit
[24:17] and he would call and just miss baker
[24:19] how you doing i'm just checking on you
[24:20] to see how you're doing
[24:22] and i took that as an honor because i
[24:25] didn't know anybody when i moved here
[24:27] i've been here about six years and the
[24:29] one thing that kind of connected us
[24:31] is because we're both from new york he's
[24:33] from the bronx i'm from brooklyn
[24:35] and so i knew exactly how to handle him
[24:38] give it to him straight i didn't have to
[24:41] beat around the bush
[24:42] i didn't have to sugarcoat anything and
[24:45] i respected him for that
[24:47] and you need to know that your husband
[24:51] gave a lot your father gave a lot
[24:54] and we're gonna miss him we're really
[24:57] gonna the guys are gonna miss him
[24:59] so mourn for him now i i do because
[25:03] that was my friend and he meant a lot to
[25:06] us
[25:07] so i just say thank you
[25:11] for allowing us to have him for the time
[25:13] that we did for the last 13 years
[25:15] and for the five that i knew him
[25:19] he was awesome and mentor is really
[25:22] going to miss him there's something
[25:23] missing
[25:24] within our company is because he's not
[25:26] going to be there anymore
[25:29] so if you crossed his path he always has
[25:33] something nice to say
[25:34] and i can remember a time when his
[25:37] vision started
[25:39] to deteriorate a little bit and
[25:42] i called him i said mr johnson um can
[25:45] you
[25:46] bring the van to me so we can put some
[25:48] gas in it and he didn't care he said
[25:50] okay
[25:50] you know miss baker i'm on my way
[25:52] because he had to come to the office
[25:53] anyways
[25:54] i was like well why is it taking him so
[25:56] long to get here it only take
[25:58] a 15-minute ride it was like 45 minutes
[26:01] and he hadn't gotten here yet
[26:02] so i was like okay i called him i said
[26:04] miss johnson you okay i'm coming
[26:07] somebody came in they said miss baker mr
[26:10] johnson riding the break the whole way
[26:12] there
[26:13] i said mr johnson do you want me to take
[26:15] the van here's mrs baker can you drive
[26:17] the van he said
[26:18] it's going to take me too long i said
[26:20] okay so
[26:22] but he didn't allow that to stop him
[26:23] from doing what he needed to do
[26:26] he did his job to the end
[26:30] and that's to be respected and we will
[26:33] miss him so
[26:33] once again i say thank you for allowing
[26:37] us to have him for the time that we did
[26:40] and my condolences to you and the family
[26:42] from
[26:43] south carolina mentor
[26:53] praise the lord everybody i bring you
[26:56] greetings on behalf of grace christian
[26:58] church
[27:00] which is a building off of monticello
[27:02] road if you've never been by there
[27:04] where
[27:07] the sweat equity of derrick
[27:11] still lives
[27:14] for those who don't know the history of
[27:18] my family and the power family we were
[27:21] one family
[27:23] two families that moved to a
[27:25] neighborhood called belvedere
[27:27] from new york and
[27:32] one of the things that jesus teaches us
[27:34] is to love your neighbor
[27:37] and derrick is not just a neighbor he
[27:40] was a brother
[27:42] because we became family by way of
[27:46] the neighborhood relationships but also
[27:50] by the way of relationships through
[27:52] mentorships
[27:53] i stand in a capacity that i don't feel
[27:56] i have
[27:57] the work to fulfill because i stand in a
[28:00] position
[28:00] speaking from the legacy of my father
[28:05] my father loved the boys in the
[28:07] neighborhood
[28:09] he wouldn't do anything to disturb their
[28:12] development
[28:13] but he'd do everything to lift them out
[28:15] of their changes
[28:18] and the thing that i remember about
[28:21] derek
[28:23] is that he desired to work out his soul
[28:25] salvation
[28:28] and my father would pick him up every
[28:30] day come on in
[28:32] your your daddy would walk down the
[28:34] street and ride with my daddy every day
[28:36] and it was
[28:37] the joking moment is when derek would
[28:39] ride with my father kamani
[28:41] would come knock on the back door and
[28:43] stay in our house for the whole day
[28:46] and so we we were neighbors we were one
[28:48] family
[28:50] and my dad mentored derek
[28:53] and i saw that change you just spoke of
[28:55] come on in
[28:57] and i saw him work with my dad and
[28:59] receive so
[29:00] many life lessons and wisdom
[29:03] and because of that derek became a
[29:06] mentor to me
[29:08] see when you are in a relationship with
[29:10] your father and you're trying to listen
[29:12] to your father
[29:12] there are times where you don't want to
[29:14] listen to your father but then there's a
[29:16] big brother like derek who
[29:17] helped rough out me smooth out the rough
[29:20] edges
[29:21] derek was that i thank god for him today
[29:25] because
[29:26] some of those moments when me and my
[29:28] father was about to get into it derek
[29:29] would step in and take me
[29:31] to the right up to the left and help
[29:34] lift me
[29:36] see that's what being a neighbor is all
[29:37] about but it's more about just being a
[29:40] worker
[29:42] because iron sharpens iron
[29:45] and when we shape each other through
[29:48] rough times and bad times
[29:50] that's when we become better because the
[29:52] bible says in
[29:54] revelations the 14th chapter the 13th
[29:56] verse
[29:57] workers will rest from their labor but
[30:00] their works shall follow them
[30:03] and their workers shall not be ashamed
[30:06] of the gospel of jesus christ today
[30:08] there's no reason to be ashamed of the
[30:10] hurt of death

[44:39] lord just let them cast all that cares
[44:41] upon you
[44:43] thank you for doing the lord bless me
[44:51] bless this family in jesus christ's name
[44:55] amen
[44:59] brother derek like to dance a little in
[45:02] the spirit
[45:05] and uh it would be
[45:10] something if we don't dance a little
[45:12] while
[45:15] but you know we got all of these people
[45:17] that have to work up a shout
[45:21] out dance for the lord
[45:24] but if the spirit was right
[45:28] brother darren would just get out in the
[45:29] aisle and he'd start dancing
[45:32] for the lord he didn't mind that
[45:38] he was always encouraging
[45:41] pastor i i really enjoyed that
[45:44] message
[45:48] and uh
[45:52] he wasn't about any foolishness
[45:55] didn't want to hear even if we thought
[45:59] it was important he said
[46:03] he wasn't about that
[46:06] and it was
[46:09] good that
[46:13] he wasn't about foolishness
[46:17] he likes to keep his peace
[46:22] and he wanted to be able to get along
[46:24] with everybody
[46:28] so we can reflect
[46:31] on many things about brother darren
[46:37] when i heard about brother david it came
[46:42] to me
[46:43] a man of faith
[46:47] and a man of prayer
[46:50] we call prayer meeting brother jarrett
[46:54] you all know men don't like to pray too
[46:56] much it's called for the praying women
[46:58] of the church
[47:01] but that brother jarrett he gonna be
[47:04] there
[47:05] if you're gonna pray
[47:08] it doesn't matter how he felt he wanted
[47:11] to be in prayer meeting
[47:15] faith i noticed
[47:19] a sister brought up about him his eyes
[47:22] getting but you couldn't tell brother
[47:25] derek that he wasn't 20 20
[47:28] or 2013.
[47:32] see because he wasn't going to speak
[47:33] negative even though he was going
[47:35] through
[47:36] it within himself but he wasn't going to
[47:38] speak it on himself
[47:42] if the doctor said your heart is you
[47:45] know this and that
[47:46] he said doc my heart is i'm well
[47:51] why he was speaking that with his
[47:52] stripes i'm here
[47:54] no matter what the x-rays said or
[47:57] what the doctor said with the stripes
[47:59] i'm here
[48:00] i believe that because the word said it
[48:03] and you're going to you're wasting your
[48:05] time
[48:06] trying to talk him out of it because
[48:10] he believed when when the covert came
[48:13] and i said gary
[48:15] you know we don't want the ones that got
[48:17] conditioned
[48:18] kind of sick you know to come in we're
[48:20] going to let some of the people come
[48:22] back
[48:23] and you know with the face mask and
[48:25] everything he said
[48:26] but pastor i'm here
[48:30] i said okay there you hear i said well
[48:32] you know the best thing for me to do
[48:34] just hold all of y'all up
[48:36] you know let's wait till because
[48:39] you weren't going to stop derrick from
[48:41] coming to church
[48:43] brother derrick was healed and i said
[48:46] you'll never take that away from
[48:48] an individual he spoke faith
[48:51] in the midst of any condition he spoke
[48:54] faith
[48:55] and many times i think that
[48:58] the average person would have been taken
[49:01] out
[49:03] if they would have looked at what the
[49:04] doctors and what the reports had said
[49:07] but derrick kept on getting up
[49:10] he kept on amen when it looked like all
[49:13] hope is lost there and still have faith
[49:16] he got up
[49:20] y'all might say darry oh
[49:23] you know you shouldn't be working this
[49:25] huh
[49:27] i'm just as well as anybody else and you
[49:30] couldn't keep them away because he loved
[49:33] mentoring he loved us you know the young
[49:35] people and he loved
[49:37] to try to help folk and he you know not
[49:40] that was his life if he couldn't do that
[49:43] i mean he just might as well be gone he
[49:46] he just loved doing that so by the grace
[49:49] of god i could say a lot of things let
[49:50] me get in
[49:51] give a few words to
[49:54] a family and and we can't
[49:58] i guess everybody just loved derrick and
[50:00] i mean
[50:01] we all did here and we appreciate it i
[50:04] know he loved the
[50:05] bishop family and uh pastor bishop i
[50:08] knew he loved y'all
[50:10] amen you oftentimes appreciate what
[50:12] y'all did
[50:14] and what your dad did in his life amen
[50:17] and so by the grace of god we
[50:21] want to go to revelation 21 for a few
[50:24] moments and just speak to you a little
[50:25] bit
[50:27] but uh you know you know i'm excited
[50:30] because i i would like to shout a little
[50:32] while
[50:33] but uh y'all y'all feel all right
[50:37] in all things give thanks god is good in
[50:41] spite of
[50:43] amen praise god i woke up this morning
[50:46] with my mind it's dead on jesus
[50:51] revelation 21 he says and i saw a new
[50:55] heaven and a new earth for the first
[50:56] heaven and first earth was passed away
[50:58] and there were no more sea and i john
[51:00] saw a holy city
[51:02] a new jerusalem coming down from god out
[51:05] of heaven prepared as a bride
[51:07] are done for her husband amen
[51:13] thank god for the bride amen
[51:17] the bride amen
[51:21] a dawn for her husband praise god
[51:26] and i heard a great voice from heaven
[51:30] saying behold
[51:31] the tabernacle god is with men and he
[51:34] will dwell
[51:35] with them and they shall be
[51:38] his people and god himself shall
[51:42] be with them and be their god
[51:45] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[51:49] their eyes
[51:50] and there shall be no more death
[51:54] neither sorrow nor crying
[51:59] neither shall there be any more pain
[52:03] for the form of things have passed away
[52:07] and he that sat upon the throne
[52:10] said behold i make all things new
[52:16] and he said unto me right
[52:19] for these words are faithful and true i
[52:22] skip down to the eighth verse and it
[52:24] says
[52:27] but the fear for and the unbelieving
[52:31] and the abominable and the myrtles and
[52:34] the whole mongers
[52:35] and the sorcerers and the idolaters
[52:39] and all liars shall have their part
[52:43] in a lake which burn with fire and
[52:46] brimstone
[52:47] which is the second death
[52:52] i would have talked talked to you a
[52:54] little bit this morning i mean this
[52:56] afternoon about
[52:58] heaven
[53:01] but there is a contrast
[53:04] there's something that
[53:08] uh we got to consider
[53:11] there is a heaven
[53:14] and there is a hell
[53:18] heaven or hell
[53:22] it might not encourage you to really
[53:25] know that their
[53:26] hell does exist
[53:29] in heaven exists
[53:33] the question in the young and talented
[53:35] mind today
[53:36] is and there's been debates that
[53:40] a loving god and a creator as we know
[53:43] god would
[53:45] not have a thing such thing that caused
[53:49] hell
[53:51] and that there would be no such thing
[53:54] that
[53:56] as we've read uh uh concerning
[54:00] the lake of fire
[54:03] but i want to talk about heaven for a
[54:05] little while
[54:07] heaven or hell i want to ask the
[54:10] question
[54:11] do you think that is real
[54:14] is heaven real
[54:18] and vice versa
[54:21] is hell really real isn't it
[54:24] is that such thing as an existence of a
[54:27] hell
[54:28] is it really real
[54:31] the reality in the the mind as we
[54:35] begin to reason and begin to think
[54:40] is there a heaven or is there hell
[54:43] see the bible talks about eternal life
[54:49] god so loved the world that he gave his
[54:51] only begotten son
[54:53] whosoever believe in him shall not
[54:54] perish but have
[54:56] everlasting life
[55:00] jesus said if a man live and believe in
[55:02] me
[55:03] he should never die yet we see
[55:07] he look like people are dying all the
[55:09] time
[55:11] but when jesus talked about ladarius
[55:14] and martha said i know i see my brother
[55:17] again in the resurrection in the last
[55:19] day
[55:19] he said now amen i want to tell you that
[55:23] i am the resurrection i
[55:26] am the life he that liveth and believeth
[55:29] in me
[55:30] shall never die
[55:33] are you with me so when the disciples
[55:37] saw
[55:38] uh uh was with jesus before he went down
[55:41] to martha and mary he said my our friend
[55:45] ladder sleep sleeping and they said to
[55:49] jesus
[55:50] if he's sleep he'd do it well
[55:54] he said now i want to make it clear to
[55:56] you he
[55:57] is dead but i am going to wake him up
[56:02] amen i believe the day
[56:05] amen as we consider for a little salt
[56:08] topping
[56:10] paul says to me to live
[56:13] is christ and to die
[56:17] is gain are you with me
[56:21] amen to live is christ
[56:25] and to die is gain
[56:28] hallelujah i believe that
[56:31] amanda as uh uh brother their son said
[56:36] daddy
[56:36] made changes and i could see it
[56:41] and now it's something about amen
[56:44] when god begins to transform
[56:47] amen a life that's been deformed by the
[56:51] devil
[56:53] but god got the power to transform
[56:57] hallelujah i'm so glad for the power of
[57:01] transformation
[57:02] that god could take a wretched
[57:06] center like you and i and god can
[57:09] transform a life
[57:12] oh is it a heaven or is it a hell
[57:16] sometimes the way we conduct our lives
[57:18] we believe
[57:19] that we're living in
[57:24] yeah mm-hmm yeah
[57:28] and sometimes the way we conduct our
[57:30] lives
[57:32] amen you said this is like

[1:00:03] jesus amen had put his seed
[1:00:07] down inside of darren amen for this is a

[1:00:55] eternal life is like a circle
[1:00:58] amen it has no beginning and no end
[1:01:01] praise god if you look back through our
[1:01:04] genealogy
[1:01:05] and oftentimes they go to family
[1:01:07] reunions
[1:01:08] amen i think uh brother bishop my mom
[1:01:12] was
[1:01:12] looking back and she found out that it
[1:01:15] meant that we were cousins
[1:01:17] and then uh sometimes we look through
[1:01:20] our genealogy
[1:01:21] and we're proud that i come from ghana
[1:01:23] and you come from this
[1:01:25] and amen but i can look farther
[1:01:28] back in than africa and see where i came
[1:01:31] from
[1:01:32] and that's what darren amen he had an
[1:01:35] opportunity
[1:01:36] to look back and see who was his real
[1:01:39] father
[1:01:39] and where he came from they met praise
[1:01:42] god
[1:01:43] and to be a son or daughter of god
[1:01:46] i'm talking about if your son a daughter
[1:01:49] of god
[1:01:50] then somewhere along the line amen
[1:01:54] in order for me to be a simmons uh amen
[1:01:57] before i ever knew i was a simon the
[1:01:59] amen i was in the lungs of my father
[1:02:02] david
[1:02:03] amen but i didn't know that i existed in
[1:02:07] islam
[1:02:08] but there was a gene seed that was down
[1:02:11] in my father
[1:02:12] that was in his father he meant that
[1:02:15] brought me forth
[1:02:16] in the appointed time and i want to tell
[1:02:19] you something
[1:02:20] uh about brother derek amen it's before
[1:02:23] the foundation of the world amen god can
[1:02:27] look
[1:02:28] and uh in order for him to amen to be a
[1:02:31] son of god
[1:02:32] now that means he was a son of god
[1:02:35] in the eternity before the stars
[1:02:39] before the foundation of the world god
[1:02:42] had found new him
[1:02:44] god knew his name god knew his troubles
[1:02:47] but god knew that one day
[1:02:49] amen amen he was going to hear the
[1:02:52] gospel
[1:02:53] hear the word of the lord and when he
[1:02:55] heard
[1:02:56] there was something down in his side
[1:02:59] amen does quicken him
[1:03:01] and said i can recognize amen
[1:03:04] that's the voice in that of my
[1:03:08] god amen my father called me

[1:03:46] oh the purpose of calvary they meant the
[1:03:49] lamb was already slain
[1:03:51] in the mind of god before the foundation
[1:03:54] of the world

[1:03:58] god
[1:03:59] before the foundation of the world he
[1:04:01] was slain
[1:04:02] because the lord saw you and i there
[1:04:06] and it was worth him coming down in the
[1:04:08] flesh
[1:04:09] to identify amen what was in his mind
[1:04:12] god took it from mine from thought to
[1:04:16] word
