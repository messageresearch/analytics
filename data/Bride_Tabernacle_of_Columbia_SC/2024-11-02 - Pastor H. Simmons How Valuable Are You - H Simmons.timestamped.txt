[30:29] [Music]
[30:33] I guess it's a little warm up
[30:37] here uh Matthew 16 and
[30:41] 24 I was just sharing a little last
[30:44] night in
[30:47] marins and I was talking and end up
[30:50] preaching a little bit but we'll try to
[30:53] just slow down a little bit we been
[30:57] going pretty
[30:59] steady it
[31:01] says then said Jesus unto the disciples
[31:04] If any man come after me let him deny
[31:08] himself take up his cross and follow me
[31:10] I think brother Caleb was talking about
[31:12] that and whosoever shall save his life
[31:15] shall lose it and whosoever shall lose
[31:18] his life for my sake shall find it and
[31:22] for what profit a man if he should gain
[31:25] the whole world and lose his own own
[31:28] soul and what shall a man give in
[31:31] exchange for his soul the son of man
[31:34] should come in his
[31:36] glory of his father
[31:40] and with with his
[31:43] angels and then he shall reward every
[31:48] man according to his Works God bless you
[31:51] read word you may be
[31:56] seated we were talking on last night
[31:59] about how valuable are
[32:02] you you know we find that
[32:06] people
[32:08] that don't have moral
[32:12] values usually
[32:14] don't it's a reason why they don't have
[32:17] moral
[32:19] values and then we were talking about
[32:23] the uh the Youth of the hour the day
[32:26] that we live in and look like like you
[32:29] know with all the gangs and violence
[32:31] people don't value life they don't mind
[32:35] killing one another shooting one another
[32:37] and just have no
[32:40] regard for
[32:42] life and that's the kind of world we
[32:46] live
[32:47] in then we look at the walls that are
[32:49] taking place
[32:51] and it seem as though it used to be a
[32:53] time
[32:54] when people wouldn't fight in the inner
[32:58] cities and populated areas they try to
[33:01] meet in no man's
[33:03] land and
[33:06] um where nobody dwell and they try to
[33:08] meet the enemy in that kind of place but
[33:13] nowadays we got to go into urban cities
[33:17] which is never thought of we going to
[33:20] urvan cities
[33:22] and and just
[33:26] people it doesn't matter what it is I
[33:29] mean either way people
[33:31] just they
[33:33] just just getting real violent the world
[33:36] is getting very Wicked very
[33:40] violent and you
[33:42] know it's it was like that in the days
[33:45] of Noah every thought imagination of man
[33:48] heart was continually evil it got so
[33:51] wicked got so
[33:53] violent to God looked down and he said I
[33:56] it repented me that I made man
[33:59] you know and I believe if he did it that
[34:02] in that day I believe he's doing it now
[34:05] it repented him that he's made
[34:09] man and then the book of Peter says and
[34:14] second Peter 3
[34:17] said that since the fathers fell asleep
[34:20] all men continued as his word from the
[34:22] beginning of creation he said for this
[34:24] they willingly ignorant
[34:26] of talked about how it was in the days
[34:29] of Noah and how it was in the days of
[34:31] Sodom
[34:33] God God may wait a long time but
[34:36] judgment
[34:38] coming I said judgment coming amen we
[34:41] might in our life might do our own thing
[34:45] and do what we want big and bad and
[34:48] nothing but I said how do you
[34:53] value how valuable are you do you value
[34:57] life life do you value your
[35:02] soul how valuable are
[35:04] you do you value your
[35:08] soul do you value your
[35:13] life sometimes we take it for granted
[35:16] that we're
[35:18] living why every day we live we're
[35:23] dying because what happens man born in
[35:28] the world it looks like he grows to a
[35:30] certain level then after while he
[35:33] started
[35:34] dying you start seeing the outside that
[35:37] man is really is really
[35:40] dying why because you get a little
[35:42] slower you hair get gray teeth might
[35:45] fall
[35:47] out or
[35:50] whatever steps get slow and nothing you
[35:53] can do to stop it can't run as fast
[35:59] not as strong as you used to be it
[36:02] getting a little weak so what is going
[36:05] on as the prophet said we eating the
[36:08] same
[36:10] food but what what makes us begin to go
[36:13] to he said a man that's born of a woman
[36:16] is few days full of
[36:18] trouble that's
[36:21] it but do you value you you value this
[36:25] life a lots of people people they are
[36:28] taking for granted they're building
[36:30] their bodies they're going out to eat
[36:32] and and they're trying to do everything
[36:35] they can do to preserve and to be
[36:38] healthy and live a a healthy life where
[36:43] they can walk and you know preserve
[36:46] themselves for a few more days if I can
[36:49] only live a few more days that'll be
[36:52] fine so people are doing things uh to uh
[36:58] uh show that you know I'm concerned
[37:00] about my natural health and my natural
[37:04] life I'm doing something because I care
[37:08] about my body I care about my
[37:12] mind so uh when you care about your mind
[37:16] you begin to do things that would cause
[37:19] your mind you know I I I
[37:22] never uh wouldn't tell a person to do
[37:27] certain games you almost children got
[37:31] little games I was I had a book like I I
[37:35] say it all the time Tero in the toy box
[37:38] and they said the computers and things
[37:40] that they were sending over here to
[37:44] America what the the reason why the
[37:47] children was having so much mental
[37:49] problem so those games were condition to
[37:53] put your mind in that condition there
[37:56] you know that have you uh have seizures
[38:01] and do things to you and it was noticed
[38:04] that certain games were giving children
[38:07] seizures and when that was way back when
[38:09] we study that back in the
[38:11] 70s you know just just what is it doing
[38:14] to our children today when when every
[38:16] child has got a game they're playing and
[38:19] the parents think nothing of it you tell
[38:21] them better
[38:24] then they don't think nothing of it
[38:28] why because you well people don't listen
[38:31] they used to listen they wouldn't give a
[38:34] child one of those
[38:36] games instead of give them educational
[38:39] things and things that's going to be
[38:41] Godly things they don't care what the
[38:44] child look at they don't care what the
[38:46] child play they don't care they're just
[38:49] busy parents are busy and grown up are
[38:52] busy they don't have time but it used to
[38:55] be be a time where we value things we
[38:59] value what your child looked at what
[39:01] your child did you know you value that
[39:05] now people are going to the movie and
[39:09] see demons and devils and they who and
[39:13] they wonder how their minds going to be
[39:16] messed
[39:16] up what kind of effect it's going to
[39:19] have on their
[39:21] lives and they know they don't know that
[39:24] those spirits that they left the movie
[39:26] with those Spirits sometimes they've
[39:28] gotten in their
[39:31] bodies but they don't even know that
[39:34] they have
[39:35] been captivated by these spirits and
[39:38] these Spirits have gotten in them now
[39:42] people don't want you to talk about it
[39:44] stay away from that don't tell the
[39:46] people nothing just let them you know
[39:49] you know we want to come to church and
[39:50] we want to hear the Jesus love
[39:53] you yeah he loves you and but we come to
[39:58] you know uh God wants you to be
[40:02] knowledgeable you know God wants you to
[40:04] understand that this world is full of
[40:07] deception and you got to you know value
[40:11] you got to be careful mindful for what
[40:14] you see what you look at what you spend
[40:17] your time with valueing life valueing
[40:21] you how valuable are you or how valuable
[40:26] of your Soul you heard the prophet of
[40:29] God said one soul is worth more than how
[40:32] many 10,000 what 10,000
[40:36] world you know one soul is worth more
[40:39] than 10,000 worlds
[40:42] yet you
[40:44] know uh what a man thinks about his soul
[40:48] he says
[40:49] here he said what in the 26th verse and
[40:53] what profit a man if he what
[40:57] gain the whole world
[40:59] and lose it
[41:02] Soul so what prophet of man if he gains
[41:05] the whole
[41:07] world but I'm going to tell you
[41:09] something things that are important and
[41:12] are valuable to
[41:13] us we actually you know we value going
[41:17] to school and getting education we value
[41:20] you know exercise we value things but do
[41:23] we value God's
[41:25] word is God word and important to us
[41:29] amen do you value your
[41:33] soul and I ask your question and I'm
[41:36] asking it again can you be
[41:44] bought you know it was a time
[41:47] when
[41:50] slaves they had the slave market and
[41:52] they said 40% of all the slaves came
[41:54] through
[41:55] chareston so South Carolina was a state
[41:58] that you know really had a lot of
[42:01] slaves and you said well what are you
[42:04] saying I'm saying people when I it's not
[42:08] a history class concerning slavery but a
[42:11] lot of times people don't want to
[42:14] realize that they're slaves one way or
[42:18] another you can be a slave to
[42:22] sin and a
[42:25] slave the the Bible say you cannot serve
[42:28] what
[42:29] two two
[42:31] masters are you with me you either love
[42:35] the one and hate the
[42:38] other you can't serve God in mamama
[42:41] ain't that right so whether we like it
[42:44] or not you can become a slave to the
[42:48] world
[42:50] system this world has an order has a
[42:54] cycle and I was listening to a very
[42:56] intelligent man I guess a genius for a
[43:00] little while and I said he show need
[43:04] Jesus he knew a whole lot
[43:08] about psychology and the different
[43:10] terminologies and
[43:12] read books time books and very
[43:16] intelligent and all I can say he show
[43:19] need
[43:21] Jesus so he was talking about he was
[43:24] going he was having therapy and and when
[43:27] he thought talked about it I I believe
[43:29] every one of us need
[43:32] therapy cuz he convinced me that I
[43:34] needed
[43:38] therapy and it'll help every one of us
[43:41] to get
[43:42] therapy and I thought about it I said we
[43:45] need sometimes sometimes we need to
[43:47] empty out and talk as a church we need
[43:52] we need to sometimes just get together
[43:54] and talk Fellowship because that's
[43:57] therapy you know what I'm
[43:59] saying but he says men will
[44:04] not do as women do they don't talk they
[44:09] hold everything
[44:11] in and he says well women they might get
[44:14] together and they'll tell about their
[44:16] hurts their pains what they going
[44:17] through but a man be hurting inside you
[44:22] heard his feeling he said d
[44:27] he got to be a
[44:29] man no he hurting no he didn't like what
[44:33] you
[44:34] said and the woman said you know she
[44:37] might sh a little tears and tell let you
[44:39] know that hurt
[44:41] me but a
[44:43] man got to be a man but all the time
[44:47] those things are wounding him and in the
[44:50] inside
[44:52] is and one day it it'll burst burst out
[44:57] and it caused all kind of uh mental
[45:00] battles and he said so many people go
[45:06] through so many sickness and
[45:10] mental
[45:12] battles but they don't talk about
[45:15] it what am I saying
[45:18] value valuing
[45:21] oneself to see what's wrong with you
[45:28] do you want to know what's wrong with
[45:31] you and see that man he had millions and
[45:34] millions of dollars but he wanted to
[45:36] find out what's wrong with
[45:39] me you see what I'm saying see the money
[45:43] was not answer he want to know what's
[45:44] wrong I know what was wrong though
[45:47] the so the
[45:49] um you know the therapist help him and
[45:53] realize what was wrong with it
[45:58] and I I
[45:59] think we got a way of having therapy
[46:04] telling us what's wrong with
[46:06] us and I know he it could soothe him and
[46:10] help him out for a little while but
[46:13] utterly he that that demon would defeat
[46:18] him sooner or
[46:20] later and I don't know that one day
[46:23] because of him being the genius like he
[46:26] is one one day he might find himself
[46:29] committing
[46:30] suicide because when you think you got
[46:34] the
[46:35] answer you only got a solution that's
[46:40] going to last for a little
[46:42] while but the thing is he need
[46:46] Jesus you know I wish I could get to him
[46:48] but he's so intelligent to what I'm
[46:51] saying you know God hides himself in
[46:53] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[46:56] same
[46:57] so you see the need of
[47:00] God and often times the answer is Jesus
[47:04] well who wants the answer amen amen go
[47:07] ahead the answer to your situation is
[47:11] Jesus amen but sometimes it's so
[47:14] difficult to get to Jesus when we got so
[47:17] many things that we're looking at and so
[47:19] many fears and so many you you know can
[47:23] I trust
[47:25] God can I believe that God can fix
[47:29] me that God can help me can I believe
[47:33] it am I able to receive help from God
[47:38] Amen God I need help yes Lord can you
[47:42] help me I believe he's more than able to
[47:46] help
[47:47] [Music]
[47:48] you can you be bor are you for sale they
[47:52] used to
[47:54] get the slaves from Africa
[47:57] sell them for this much sell them for
[47:59] that
[48:00] much how valuable would you be what what
[48:04] would be your
[48:05] price are you for

[48:38] silk you understand and sometime the
[48:42] devil will give you
[48:45] something something
[48:48] that you would think that's more
[48:52] valuable than your soul
[48:57] a lot of times you heard very rapidly I
[49:00] mean lately concerning those movie stars
[49:04] and everybody that's out there in
[49:06] Hollywood and all the successful people
[49:09] that in order to be successful you got
[49:11] to sell your
[49:13] soul and uh most people didn't believe
[49:16] that I remember way back I met a a a
[49:22] brother that was running for his life
[49:24] because he had left hwood and
[49:28] everything and he was telling me he said
[49:31] I'm running for my
[49:35] life he was very you know he looked like
[49:38] a movie star very hon young
[49:43] man and he said I I I found out what's
[49:47] out
[49:48] there and he start tell telling me about
[49:51] the different movie stars and all and he
[49:54] told me about their
[49:59] conditions and he said he's got to try
[50:01] to hide because they'll
[50:04] killing and that was way back now and I
[50:09] didn't see him but that one time I never
[50:12] seen him
[50:14] again but he was T and and and you run
[50:17] into people in
[50:19] life that's a price you
[50:23] pay it's a price you pay if you don't
[50:27] serve the Lord It's Gonna cost you
[50:32] amen it's a price you paying if you
[50:35] don't want God
[50:38] Amen you know they'll take a
[50:41] man you know you have to be big like
[50:46] Caleb probably go for a good price back
[50:50] in the
[50:51] day Gerald you go for half the price you
[50:55] a little smaller
[50:57] you know what I'm saying and they'll say
[51:00] you you know what I'm
[51:03] saying but here we are Amen in this hour
[51:07] thinking that slavery is gone and if you
[51:10] see the Book of Revelation it said in
[51:13] slaves and The Souls of
[51:16] men when it talks
[51:18] about you know
[51:21] those the Antichrist and the spirit that
[51:24] would take
[51:25] place in in Babylon and so forth and at
[51:29] the end of the
[51:30] road so we we're headed down that
[51:37] road that this great deception The Souls
[51:41] of
[51:42] men and
[51:45] slavery could be returning to the
[51:49] world but where will you
[51:53] be if we reap what we sow
[51:58] where would you be if this thing
[52:01] reoccur and people don't know it right
[52:06] now that there's spiritual
[52:11] slavery and people are spiritually
[52:15] bound with chains of Darkness yes
[52:19] sir but they don't know
[52:23] it because the devil is very accepted
[52:27] amen and he deceive Eve and so he's
[52:32] deceiving this
[52:35] world deception is in the making now and
[52:40] people are being deceived and you know

[53:57] testimony you better not open your mouth
[53:59] cuz they ain't going to let you open
