[30:38] Hebrews 11 and 30 it says by faith the

[30:46] after the
[30:47] working past about seven days by faith
[30:52] the ray the Holland rehab

[31:16] Women of Faith amen
[31:21] women that allowed themselves to be used
[31:25] of God
[31:28] women that
[31:30] sacrifice their life for the purpose
[31:34] and the will of God
[31:36] and they understood that
[31:39] that God had a purpose in their lives
[31:43] so rehab the Harlem
[31:46] out of all the places
[31:49] in Jericho God
[31:53] sent despised to
[31:55] rayham
[31:57] it says it specifies that it was Rahab
[32:02] the Holland
[32:04] something that we were meditating on
[32:08] God doesn't care
[32:11] Who You Are
[32:13] away you are
[32:16] I want you to know he's mindful of you
[32:20] doesn't matter the condition that you're
[32:22] in
[32:24] God sees you
[32:27] and God knows how to find you
[32:31] doesn't matter where you are
[32:34] no matter what you've done
[32:37] Women of Faith
[32:39] you know God makes certain choices in
[32:42] this
[32:43] decisions he wants to find
[32:46] somebody that
[32:48] he wants to use
[32:51] and to be a light
[32:53] and sometimes the places that God goes
[32:56] to find these individuals it
[32:58] it just started the mind and
[33:02] I said sometimes when we call it
[33:05] thinking with outside the box God does
[33:09] you know we have a box so
[33:12] that we put God in sometimes God moves
[33:15] right outside the box
[33:17] and not the way you think he said your
[33:20] thoughts are not my thoughts
[33:23] so God can move outside of you
[33:27] oh the way you think and the way you
[33:30] will look at where God want to use the
[33:33] Women of Faith what kind of women are
[33:35] Women of Faith
[33:37] what kind of women did God choose
[33:40] and that seems as though those that
[33:43] things that those those things that are
[33:46] despised those things that seem to be
[33:48] rejected and those individuals that seem
[33:51] to be
[33:52] amen something that the you know the
[33:55] world will look down on God moves on
[33:59] past that
[34:01] and he sees
[34:03] amen he sees it real women now faith
[34:07] that can be used of God
[34:10] so on this mother day we thank God for
[34:14] my mother and amen she's going on but
[34:18] she set an example amen
[34:21] and we thank God for my wife and
[34:24] I look at the children and
[34:27] I oftentimes say thank the Lord for my
[34:30] wife
[34:32] you know because
[34:35] the prophet of God said a wife will
[34:38] she is a manifestation of who you are
[34:41] she would represent you
[34:45] so by the grace of God I look at the
[34:47] children and see the fruits of her labor
[34:50] and I thank God for her and

[36:17] the light and grace of God we thank God
[36:22] now Women of Faith we said look like God
[36:27] just thinks what's outside of the box
[36:29] and your choice is not God's choice and
[36:32] he said your ways are not my ways your
[36:34] thoughts they're not my thoughts
[36:36] so we want to go Mike here to
[36:42] when we look at rehab
[36:44] out of all the people that were
[36:48] in Jericho God sent them by a place
[36:52] of a woman that was you know you know no
[36:57] way

[37:09] are living Believers of the true Living
[37:11] God here they are going in to search out
[37:14] the country the spot and then God's
[37:17] Providence sent them to the right place
[37:20] at the right time
[37:22] send them to a woman or that's a Harlem
[37:25] and she amen she hid them
[37:30] stood in the Gap and then she began to
[37:32] talk to them about amen that
[37:38] she knew that they were gonna conquer
[37:41] the city and they were gonna amen
[37:44] destroy the city and so forth and she
[37:47] had confidence in them amen not knowing
[37:50] of strangers but yet she knew that their
[37:53] God was with them
[37:55] amen
[37:57] so even beforehand she amen she didn't
[38:01] see it but she heard about the God that
[38:03] they served and she heard about the God
[38:06] that was with them and she believed
[38:09] amen even in her condition she believed
[38:13] amen so she was able to amen uh because
[38:17] of her believing she put her faith in
[38:21] action
[38:22] amen she put our faith in action because
[38:25] she hid them amen and she protected them
[38:28] while they were in the city amen
[38:31] so by the grace of God sometimes our
[38:33] faith has to move out and just not
[38:36] saying I'm believing but I want to be
[38:38] used
[38:39] when I said Women of Faith the Bible
[38:42] tells us faith without works is dead
[38:45] amen so Rahab was used amen and I said
[38:50] if I had to put a little bit Women of
[38:54] Faith I said Use Me Lord
[38:57] Lord I want to be used by you
[39:00] amen
[39:02] so as we move on along we want to look
[39:06] at
[39:07] Luke 4
[39:10] Luke 4.
[39:12] and I said thinking sometimes without
[39:14] the box and thinking God goes beyond the
[39:18] way we think and how we look at things
[39:21] and he just chooses whom he will
[39:25] does what he want to do
[39:28] uh Caleb you got it
[39:31] uh
[39:33] Luke 4
[39:36] and 23
[39:40] so by the grace of God
[39:42] look forward 23 God is good amen
[39:47] go right ahead and he said unto them you
[39:50] will surely say unto me this proverb
[39:53] Phoenician heal thy physician heal
[39:56] thyself amen
[39:57] whatsoever We Have Heard done in
[40:00] Capernaum do also here in thy country
[40:05] he said verily I say unto you no Prophet
[40:08] is accepted in his own country
[40:11] but I'll tell you of a truth many widows
[40:14] were in Israel in the days of Elias when
[40:17] the heaven was shut up three years and
[40:19] six months when Great Famine was
[40:22] throughout all the land but unto none of
[40:24] them was the life Elias sent saved unto
[40:29] servata a city of sidon unto a woman
[40:33] that was a widow and many lepers were in
[40:36] Israel in the time of
[40:41] this woman
[40:44] the god
[40:45] went all of Israel sometimes we need to
[40:49] look at different ones in them we said
[40:52] Lord use me why didn't you use me
[40:56] let's go to first king 17. why did why
[41:00] did God bypass me and go use somebody
[41:03] else that I you know look like I was in
[41:06] better positions
[41:08] he said many widows was in Israel
[41:11] but God didn't go to none of them
[41:14] are you with me
[41:16] but he went out to another country
[41:18] looked like a gentile country
[41:22] sometimes God will bypass
[41:25] what we think and what we was doing but
[41:29] he's he knows how to find who he can use
[41:33] you find somebody that he could use for
[41:37] the need for the purpose of the moment
[41:39] of the hour
[41:41] he finds somebody that want to be used
[41:44] even though she didn't even know what
[41:46] was in her until the prophet revealed to
[41:50] her that God wanted to use her
[41:53] are you with me
[41:55] so God wanted to use this woman and
[41:59] let's look at First Kings 17 and 9.
[42:03] kill him
[42:05] arise
[42:07] which belonged to Zion and dwell there
[42:10] behold I have commanded a widow woman
[42:13] there to sustain thee look at God look
[42:17] at God
[42:19] I I commanded a widow woman to sustain
[42:21] you a prophet a man
[42:24] but I'm gonna let a woman sustain you
[42:27] God thinking without look like him your
[42:30] man
[42:31] but I commanded this with a woman to
[42:33] sustain you
[42:36] but I'm gonna command her to sustain you
[42:39] it's a famine in the land you know
[42:42] it had go ahead and read
[42:45] so he arose and went to verify and when
[42:48] he came to the gate of the city behold
[42:50] the widow woman was there Gathering of
[42:53] sticks and he called to her and said
[42:55] fetch me and I pray thee a little water
[42:57] in a vessel that I may drink
[42:59] and as she was going to fetch it he
[43:02] called her and said bring me I pray the
[43:04] immortal bread in thine hand and she
[43:07] said as the Lord thy God liveth I have
[43:10] not a cake nor a handful of but a
[43:13] handful of meal in a barrel and a little
[43:15] oil in a cruise and behold I am
[43:18] Gathering two sticks now I may go in and
[43:21] dress it for me and my son that we made
[43:24] it and die
[43:26] you know I'm asking you to do something
[43:30] you know most of us how we think
[43:33] God how you you gonna use me God's gonna
[43:36] take my last
[43:39] the prophet is asking for my last
[43:43] and I'm gonna I'm talking about Women of
[43:46] Faith
[43:47] it took faith for that woman to hear the
[43:50] prophet
[43:52] him what thus said the law it took faith
[43:54] for her to move
[43:57] you know if we we we're reading about
[44:00] things that happen in Bible days and
[44:02] then time passed but these things are
[44:05] written for our example
[44:08] amen
[44:09] that when we see scriptures that it
[44:12] might build faith in us that we said God
[44:14] if you did it for them you can do it for
[44:16] me
[44:18] if you use them in the condition that
[44:20] they were in can't you use Me Lord
[44:24] I want to be usually but this woman
[44:27] okay God is asking you to do something
[44:29] that most of us would question
[44:34] a man or woman but these are we talking
[44:36] about Women of Faith Mother's Day happy
[44:39] Mother's Day to everybody but this
[44:41] that's why we're talking about Women of
[44:43] Faith
[44:45] you know
[44:47] but it would be very questionable
[44:52] that we would even question God why
[44:55] you're gonna send this Prophet this man
[44:58] of God here at this particular time
[45:01] knowing that the condition that I'm in
[45:05] you know sometimes the condition that
[45:07] folks are in
[45:09] they choose rather you know I'm saying
[45:12] that I I I I it's me and my son and you
[45:18] asking for my last uh-uh
[45:21] see some of us make decisions
[45:24] based on Amen what we see and not what
[45:28] we say we believe
[45:31] see if you're going to have faith is the
[45:34] substance of things hoped for and it's
[45:36] the evidence of things you want
[45:38] not seen it took amen this woman amen
[45:42] having enough faith I can't see it but
[45:46] yet I'm gonna believe it
[45:48] I don't understand where you're going
[45:51] with this but it's something not in our
[45:54] heart amen says you know he said thus
[45:58] said the Lord I I believe that this is
[46:01] something I I believe she believed that
[46:03] that was a man of God
[46:05] and you know he don't come all the way
[46:08] over here in this Gentile land which
[46:11] he's a Jew and he's over here with me
[46:14] and asking me to do something that
[46:16] seemed to be impossible
[46:20] see when God Moves In The Impossible
[46:24] and he wants to do the impossible for
[46:26] you
[46:27] God Moves In The Impossible and he wants
[46:30] to do that for you
[46:32] but yet sometimes because we question
[46:35] whether God is the god of the impossible
[46:38] and God want to use amen you for his
[46:42] purpose and for his will but many of us
[46:45] are not available
[46:50] there's no room I can't understand how I
[46:54] can even serve your purpose and your
[46:57] will in my life Lord what can I do
[47:03] most of the time we we're kind of you
[47:06] know
[47:06] reserve and so God has to bypass all of
[47:11] those that uh seems to be uh reserved
[47:15] and stuck up on themselves amen but God
[47:19] want to use somebody that's willing
[47:22] somebody that's willing to Amen to God
[47:26] used Me to Your Glory
[47:28] the event somebody that's gonna
[47:31] think without the box I'm not gonna be
[47:35] closed-minded I'm going without I'm
[47:37] gonna have faith I'm gonna trust God
[47:39] beyond the circumstances condition I
[47:42] know the payment is in the land and I
[47:45] know the amen the spirit of God is not
[47:47] moving like it used to move and amen
[47:50] we're not experienced amen wave after
[47:53] wave and the power of God look like it's
[47:56] not moving like it ought to move but
[47:59] God comes in a famous time
[48:03] a time of Fame and when amen it hadn't
[48:06] rained for three and a half years but
[48:08] yet God says to Elijah goes to that
[48:12] woman
[48:13] amen I'll be surprised as the Lord put
[48:17] these things in my heart it'll be
[48:20] surprising that God will bypass
[48:24] you know a lot of widows and go and find
[48:28] somebody
[48:30] amen that's out there amen that's
[48:33] wondering amen what am I going to do
[48:36] with my life
[48:37] what's my next step
[48:40] my life seems like it's perishing I'm
[48:43] down and out and I don't know what to do
[48:45] with myself
[48:47] that God will bypass amen those that
[48:51] were in Israel to go over here to this
[48:54] woman and ask her to do something that
[48:57] was very difficult
[48:59] amen would God speak to us
[49:02] and access to do some difficult things
[49:06] the Bible said he said I'm the same
[49:09] yesterday in the day and forever I'm God
[49:12] and I change not
[49:13] so if we understand how God worked
[49:16] yesterday and we know how God works
[49:19] today
[49:20] because he's the same God if he did it
[49:23] that way yesterday then God would deal
[49:26] with us in a spiritual Manner and he
[49:29] asks us about doing things that seem to
[49:32] be a little against the grain
[49:35] amen praise God these things amen we're
[49:39] going against the current amen you know
[49:43] Bishop Washington used to say any dead
[49:46] fish can go Downstream but it takes a
[49:49] live fish to go against the current
[49:52] are you with me
[49:53] so uh a lot of times amen we we can go
[49:58] with the flow but when you're going
[50:00] against the floor you gotta you got to
[50:03] have something to do that and I'm saying
[50:06] you got to be able to turn against the
[50:09] crowd against those that are all flowing
[50:12] in One Direction and you got to go
[50:14] against your grain you got to go against
[50:16] your current amen but you got to be
[50:19] alive amen you got to have faith to do
[50:21] that
[50:22] praise God you got to have I'm talking
[50:24] about Women of Faith amen that's going
[50:27] to look Beyond amen where everybody else
[50:30] is going and what everybody else is
[50:32] doing amen but they're going to take
[50:34] amen that's straight and narrow
[50:39] Women of Faith
[50:43] where did you stop it
[50:51] and die 13 13 and the largest
[50:55] settlements of her fear not go and do as
[50:57] thou has said but make me there for a
[51:00] little cake first and bring it unto me
[51:03] and after make for thee and for thy son
[51:07] okay I'm gonna tell you something things
[51:10] are gonna happen for you
[51:12] if you put God first things are going to
[51:15] happen
[51:16] seek ye first the kingdom of God his
[51:18] righteousness and things are going to
[51:20] happen things are going to get better
[51:22] but we take Women of Faith
[51:25] it takes somebody amen that's going to
[51:27] believe God
[51:30] somebody who's going to trust God things
[51:32] are going to get better but you got to
[51:34] do what God Said first
[51:36] praise God you've got to do what God
[51:38] Said first and then you watch God what
[51:41] he does for you once you do what he says
[51:44] First Watch what he do does for you
[51:48] amen
[51:50] but you gotta it
[51:54] I mean can you see yourself battling
[51:57] with it because you can't
[52:00] this is hard this is hard and I know God
[52:03] spoke to us in many occasions about
[52:05] different things in our lives but we
[52:08] struggle with amen
[52:10] I can't do that
[52:13] I ain't no ah that must be
[52:21] did not hear right
[52:23] no no he couldn't he couldn't have told
[52:26] me to do that no no no no no no no not
[52:29] me not that because he know if I do this
[52:33] then I'm gonna have he said it's not
[52:36] gonna run out
[52:38] amen
[52:40] amen things are going to work to your
[52:43] good
[52:45] amen listen to my voice and hear my word
[52:49] and things are going to work out till
[52:51] you're good
[52:52] it ain't what you can see it's what you
[52:55] can believe
[52:57] and things are going to work till you're
[52:59] good
[53:00] praise God you don't know how many
[53:02] blessings are waiting on you only if you
[53:05] would hear God
[53:07] only if you would listen to him amen you
[53:11] sometimes we want what we can see to
[53:13] bless us
[53:15] but you got to look beyond what you can
[53:17] see but what you can believe
[53:20] God wants to bless you
[53:23] but you gotta look beyond that
[53:25] amen but it takes faith it takes Women
[53:28] of Faith
[53:30] amen
[53:34] so Elijah told them what to do amen
[53:37] and and then then he was confident
[53:39] Elijah was confident
[53:42] and what he said
[53:44] he said y'all gonna have something to
[53:45] eat don't worry about nothing just just
[53:48] give me first but y'all gonna have
[53:49] something to eat
[53:51] do what God Said first and God gonna
[53:53] take care of Amen your knees
[53:58] go ahead on next verse but thus saith
[54:01] the Lord God of Israel the bearer of
[54:04] meal shall not waste neither shall the
[54:06] crews of oil fail until the day that the
[54:09] Lord sent us rain upon the earth I want

[57:09] brother Gordon said somebody prayed for

[57:12] amen praise God I I saw mother Tate with
[57:16] her mind I mean oh I wasn't calling uh
[57:18] Alzheimer's or whatever you call it amen
[57:21] but she every time I was quoting
[57:24] scripture she was quoting right along
[57:25] she knew the song Amen why she had
[57:28] something down deep
[57:30] she had something on deep it was inside
[57:32] of her everything that's gone but I

[58:31] like Mama I want to be like Grandma I
[58:33] want to you know a person of faith
[58:37] are you up here
[58:41] Women of Faith that won't give up
[58:44] amen
[58:46] they won't give up on you
[58:52] let's go on to the next version Lord
[58:58] and she went and did according to the
[59:01] sin of Elijah and she and he and her
[59:04] house to eat many days the 16th versions
[59:07] in the barrel of meal wasted not neither
[59:10] did the cruise of oil fill according to
[59:12] the word of the Lord which he spanked by
[59:14] Elijah I'm gonna tell you something
[59:17] God Will Never Let You Down
[59:22] um Ruth the first chapter God Will Never
[59:25] Let You Down
[59:27] it doesn't matter how long amen the
[59:30] famous last
[59:32] God had enough
[59:34] to take her through the fame
[59:36] because she put him first
[59:38] and I'm gonna tell you no matter how
[59:40] much trouble and how many storms coming
[59:42] in life
[59:43] if you just trust God
[59:46] put him first
[59:48] he'll sustain you
[59:50] he sustained you when the doctor shake
[59:52] the head God still sustain you
[59:55] you know if somebody says you know the
[1:00:00] women amen they had the children ripped
[1:00:02] from their stomach and all of that
[1:00:05] and they were killed they were so on the
[1:00:07] Sunday but they stood the test
[1:00:11] they were able to stand up for God
[1:00:13] regardless of the price of the cause
[1:00:17] amen
[1:00:18] they were put to death because they took
[1:00:20] a stand for God
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:24] and I'm gonna say something about those
[1:00:26] women that that have been a faithful
[1:00:30] examples
[1:00:32] amen maybe they didn't look like amen
[1:00:37] we look today and maybe they didn't have
[1:00:40] amen but I think they the battles that
[1:00:44] they have faced is the same battles that
[1:00:46] we face but they're just spiritual
[1:00:48] battles
[1:00:50] and those spiritual battles that we Face
[1:00:52] we got to be mindful amen that there's
[1:00:55] no temptation taking you but such is
[1:00:58] common to man but God would with the
[1:01:01] Temptation he'll make a way of Escape
[1:01:03] for you
[1:01:04] so what you go into and what you've been
[1:01:07] through God is mindful of that and God
[1:01:10] knows how to make a way of Escape for
[1:01:12] you
[1:01:13] and you got to be well grounded to

[1:03:13] knocked down
[1:03:14] he will surely bring you out
[1:03:16] yes he will
[1:03:19] roof one and one
[1:03:23] in a reason I came to pass in the days
[1:03:26] when the judges ruled that there was
[1:03:28] payment in the land and a certain man of
[1:03:30] Bethlehem Judea went to sojourn in the
[1:03:33] country of Moab he and his wife and his
[1:03:36] two sons and the name of the man was
[1:03:39] elimelech and his wife Naomi in the name
[1:03:42] of his two sons Mylon and chill on Carol
[1:03:47] go ahead
[1:03:50] foreign
[1:03:54] and they came into the country of Moab
[1:03:58] and continued there and eliminate
[1:04:00] Naomi's husband died and she was left in
[1:04:03] her two sons and they took them wise of
[1:04:05] the women of Moab the name of one was
[1:04:08] Oprah in the name of the other Rule and
[1:04:11] they dwelled there about 10 years a mile
[1:04:14] on in China died also both of them and
[1:04:19] the women were left of her two sons and
[1:04:21] her husband
[1:04:23] then she arose with her daughters-in-law
[1:04:25] that she might return into the country
[1:04:27] of Moab from the country of Moab where
[1:04:30] she had heard in the country of Moab how
[1:04:33] that the Lord had visited his people and
[1:04:35] given them bread wherefore she went
[1:04:38] forth out of the place where she was and
[1:04:40] her two daughter-in-laws with her and
[1:04:43] they went into the way to return into
[1:04:45] the land of Judah
[1:04:46] and Naomi said unto her two
[1:04:48] daughters-in-law go return each to their
[1:04:51] mother's house the Lord did kindly with
[1:04:54] you as ye have
[1:04:56] dealt with the dead and with me the Lord
[1:05:00] grants you that ye may find rest each of
[1:05:03] you in the house of her husband then she
[1:05:05] kissed them and they lifted up their
[1:05:07] voice and wept
[1:05:08] and they said unto her surely we will
[1:05:11] return with thee unto thy people and
[1:05:14] Naomi said turn again my daughters why
[1:05:17] will you go with me other than yet any
[1:05:20] more signs in my womb that they may be
[1:05:24] your husband turn again my daughters go
[1:05:27] your way
[1:05:28] but I am too old to have a husband if I
[1:05:31] should say I have hope if I should have
[1:05:34] a husband also tonight and should also
[1:05:37] bear Sons would you tarry for them till
[1:05:39] they were grown would you stay for them
[1:05:42] from having husbands name our daughters
[1:05:45] for it is for grieveth me much for your
[1:05:49] sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone
[1:05:51] out against me and they lifted up their
[1:05:53] voice and what again and over kissed her
[1:05:56] mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her
[1:05:58] she said behold thy sister-in-law is
[1:06:01] going back into her people and unto her
[1:06:04] God and to her what God's gods go ahead
[1:06:08] return Thou after thy sister-in-law and
[1:06:12] Ruth said and treat me not to leave thee
[1:06:14] or to return from following after thee
[1:06:17] for whether thou go as I will go excuse
[1:06:19] me hold it now
[1:06:21] Naomi had a testimony
[1:06:25] you see what I'm saying when you got a
[1:06:26] testimony and that testimony is anchored
[1:06:29] you see what I'm saying Naomi had a
[1:06:33] testimony
[1:06:35] and her testimony was Amen exemplified
[1:06:39] in her daughter-in-laws but one of them
[1:06:43] she just you know didn't have it deep
[1:06:45] enough
[1:06:47] amen so she said Return to your gods
[1:06:51] but that was Ruth that she held and she
[1:06:54] cleaved
[1:06:56] are you a man I'm gonna tell you
[1:06:58] something if you ain't got it deep
[1:07:00] enough you might do lack awful
[1:07:03] and you might go back and serve
[1:07:05] amen the gods of the world Amen
[1:07:10] but if you got it deep enough you said
[1:07:12] uh you know I I'm Not Gonna Let You Go
[1:07:15] amen because I've seen in you now oh man
[1:07:19] I got confidence in you I'm talking
[1:07:22] about Women of Faith
[1:07:24] I believe that Naomi had exemplified
[1:07:28] faith I believe that she had testified
[1:07:32] of a God Amen that was in Israel
[1:07:37] and she had told them uh Ruth about this
[1:07:40] one God
[1:07:42] are you
[1:07:44] and the rule favor it must have by
[1:07:47] Revelation and anchored in her

[1:07:52] talking about women of God Women of
[1:07:54] Faith this morning

[1:09:06] living God

[1:15:53] I gotta move on to the next story
[1:15:57] in the
[1:15:58] that's John 4th I don't want to bypass
[1:16:01] this one
[1:16:03] and then I'll close hopefully
[1:16:06] John 4
[1:16:08] I know we heard the story but
[1:16:10] nevertheless
[1:16:12] the 13th verse
[1:16:15] John 4.
[1:16:17] and 13.
[1:16:23] Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:16:25] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:16:28] thirst again but whosoever drinking of
[1:16:32] the water that I shall give thee shall
[1:16:34] never thirst but the water that I shall
[1:16:36] give him shall be in him a well of water
[1:16:39] springing up into Everlasting he met a
[1:16:42] certain woman at the well you know I
[1:16:44] said God makes a decision and chooses
[1:16:48] I I say he chose somebody that wasn't
[1:16:50] even in Israel with a woman in another
[1:16:52] country Gentile chose her
[1:16:55] he took rehab to Holland and he chose
[1:16:57] her
[1:17:00] amen so sometimes God thinks without the
[1:17:03] Box because some folks don't want to be
[1:17:05] used
[1:17:07] some folks are saying hey I'm too
[1:17:09] obviously I'm you know they got their
[1:17:12] mind even if God would have came to them
[1:17:14] and asked them they wouldn't uh uh not
[1:17:17] me I know no no but these women was able
[1:17:22] to make the right decision and said use
[1:17:24] me
[1:17:26] okay go ahead
[1:17:30] woman saith unto him sir give me this
[1:17:33] water that I thirst not neither come
[1:17:36] either to draw and Jesus said unto her
[1:17:40] go call thy husband and come hither
[1:17:43] go ahead
[1:17:46] the woman answered and said I have no
[1:17:48] husband and Jesus said unto her thou has
[1:17:51] well said I have no husband for thou has
[1:17:55] had five husbands and he whom down now
[1:17:58] has is not thy husband and
[1:18:02] that says Thou truly the woman saith
[1:18:05] unto him sir I proceeded thou art a
[1:18:07] prophet our father's worship that woman
[1:18:09] didn't say stay out of my business
[1:18:14] leave my business alone what are you
[1:18:16] doing messing with me
[1:18:18] you know what I'm saying
[1:18:20] the Pharisees are up in here
[1:18:23] and told Jesus
[1:18:25] you know
[1:18:28] what you did in the other country come
[1:18:30] here and do it for us you see what I'm
[1:18:33] saying but this woman she wasn't picky
[1:18:36] and going on like you know some folk
[1:18:38] will say you know she was Meek and
[1:18:41] humble
[1:18:43] are you
[1:18:47] picking on me
[1:18:49] you know what I'm saying see because
[1:18:50] what the Jews call invisible Prince of
[1:18:53] devils isn't that right
[1:18:55] but this woman here that was in the
[1:18:57] condition that she was in
[1:18:59] yet
[1:19:01] she was in the right place at the right
[1:19:03] time and God knew where she was
[1:19:06] he knew all about her all about her past
[1:19:09] all about what she was going through yet
[1:19:12] he chose her
[1:19:14] uh-huh that's what he does
[1:19:16] who you think I I you know how did this
[1:19:20] point that one would probably went
[1:19:23] through a lot of stuff in the church
[1:19:27] for
[1:19:28] doing all kind of stuff amen should I
[1:19:31] met through a whole lot of stuff
[1:19:35] but she and she couldn't even get water
[1:19:38] with the rest of the women
[1:19:40] she had to go there alone by herself
[1:19:42] sneak and get us some
[1:19:45] are you with me
[1:19:46] but here you know sometimes we feel like
[1:19:49] amen I I I I can't be around the rest of
[1:19:53] them
[1:19:54] are you up
[1:19:56] but God knew that that woman needed
[1:19:58] something
[1:20:00] I'm gonna tell you something you know me
[1:20:02] going through this message I said God
[1:20:04] knew she needed something
[1:20:06] and God knew when we need something
[1:20:10] amen God knew when we need a word from
[1:20:12] him
[1:20:13] we needed encourage men
[1:20:16] we need to know that God understand the
[1:20:19] seeds what I'm going to
[1:20:21] understand my problems
[1:20:23] God God look at me now
[1:20:26] so the woman here at the well
[1:20:29] and he's telling her amen I'm gonna give
[1:20:32] you some water amen
[1:20:34] that you're never thirst again
[1:20:38] go ahead on Brett kill
[1:20:40] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[1:20:42] and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place
[1:20:45] where men ought to worship and Jesus
[1:20:47] said unto her woman believe me that our
[1:20:50] cometh when ye shall neither in this
[1:20:52] mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship
[1:20:54] the father he worship ye no not what we
[1:21:01] know what we what we worship for
[1:21:03] salvation is of the Jews but the our
[1:21:05] cometh and now is when the true worship
[1:21:08] pressure worship the father in spirit
[1:21:10] and in true for the father seeketh such
[1:21:14] to worship him God is a spirit and they
[1:21:17] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:21:19] spirit and in truth she said he had
[1:21:21] enough time to go by and deal with that
[1:21:23] woman needs and speak to her concerning
[1:21:26] things that he couldn't tell them about
[1:21:30] are you with me because they would they
[1:21:33] didn't want to hear him because they
[1:21:34] call him visible amen they they didn't
[1:21:36] you know the folks in the synagogue they
[1:21:39] didn't want him
