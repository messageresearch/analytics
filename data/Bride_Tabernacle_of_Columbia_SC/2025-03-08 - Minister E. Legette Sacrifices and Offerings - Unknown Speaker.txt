oh God that would give us oh God what what we need we thank you Lord we love you we appreciate you for all things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen we want to look at the Book of Malachi by the grace of God Malachi 1 won't be long tonight amen God is good amen Malachi 1 and we'll start at the first verse Malachi 1 and one if you got it say amen and it reads the burden of the word of the Lord to is Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayth the Lord yet ye say wherein has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayeth the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness where is where is Edom say where we are impoverished but we will return and build the desolate places thus sayith the Lord of hosts they shall build but I will throw down and they shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom the Lord have in indignation forever and your eyes shall see and ye shall say the Lord will be magnified from the border of Israel you may be seated I'm going read down a little further a son honth his father and his and a servant his master if then I be a father where is my honor and if I be a master where is my fear sayth the lord of the host of host un to you oh priest that despise my name and ye say wherein have ye despised we despise thy name Ye Ye offer polluted bread upon mine Altar and ye say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of the Lord is cont temptable and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is that not evil is it not evil and if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy Governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person sayeth the Lord of hosts and now I pray you beseech God that he will be gracious unto us this have been by your means will he regard your persons sayeth the Lord of host who is there among you that would shut the doors for not neither do you Kindle Fire on M Altar for not I have no pleasure in you sayth the Lord of hosts neither will I accept an offering at your hand at your hand may God bless to the reading of his word tonight by the grace of God we want to minister on a little short topic amen and I I entitled it sacrifices and offerings amen sacrifices and offerings you know here we finding that you know the people they were they were giving something to God as we said they were giving the offering to God but it wasn't what God was God wasn't accepting it was he one thing one thing they had lost and I I was seeing here in the sixth verse one thing they had lost he says if I if I'm a father where is my honor right and he says if I'm a master where is my fear right because the people had stopped fearing God right and that that was in that time and I believe we live in a time right now where the people don't fear God no more you know my grandmother used to say uh something all the time she say a man that don't fear God or do anything amen and that that's to be the truth cuz he don't fear God right but we find that that's the hour that we live in today how many believe that but I says that you know sacrifice and offerings you know you can you can be making a sacrifice but just cuz you making a sacrifice that don't make it God's will that's right come on you know it's it's a thing it's something about you know God's will you can be in his perfect will or his permissive will or sometimes just not even in his will altogether right but we find that in God's perfect will that's the place that you and I want to be at you know in the permissive will you'll suffer for some things won't you come on God might allow some things but look at the aftermath of what God of the thing and that's what sometimes you know individuals in their heart you know they they like like I was saying the other day they have a a buzzer or something go off to let them know that what you doing ain't right right or what you about to do leave it alone right but they go past all the buzzles all the stop signs and all they run those things over and they go and do it anyway right and sometimes God God allow permit it you know he want destroy you right there but you going to suffer for those things come on and sometimes people look at it and they say well I'll just do it and I'll just suffer but I want to say one thing when God get done with you come on sometimes people think that they they can bear but when God get done with you you wish today you had never done that you know I thinking about once in uh scriptures David and and Bash Sheba and how you know was caught up in the flesh and done those things we would say oh that was God's you know perfect will for Solomon to come and then you know you can say it was God permission will that he allowed it but look at the aftermath of it come on the aftermath of it was bad so sometimes people compare themselves to certain sins like that but you don't want to do that Hallelujah no at all at all cause at all times you want to be in God's perfect will I don't know about you but I want to be in God's perfect will at all times you know what happens is God's perfect will for your life a lot of times it doesn't agree with what your flesh want come on it ain't going to be what the flesh want right that's what it is the way this road to to to Heaven it ain't no it ain't no Cakewalk come on people want to get there without no cross without a cross but he says you know any man that come after me got to First deny him what self take up his what cross and follow me you know we here on this Earth we got to Bear a cross right no it's blessings in the cross but I'm going say you ain't getting you ain't walking that straight and that narrow way without a cross but so many people run from that cross don't they come on but like I said the other day should Jesus bear the cross Alone come on but we find that like it says sacrifice and offerings God had a problem with their with their offerings and their sacrifice didn't he come on they they it's not that they wasn't giving one but the one that they was giving God had a problem with it didn't he come on and I thinking today I said you know God got a problem today with sacrifice of the people you know God only permit I believe God only put up with stuff so long right then after a while God ain't putting up with it no more I believe that come on you know that's why you know we we weigh our own actions right sometimes we can say well you know uh oh this person been through that and been through this and and that may be true but that doesn't necessarily mean just because you've been through something you get out the will of God right come on God permit things for a certain amount of time but what it is the trial and the tribulations you go through should not take you away from God that's right it should draw you closer to God if it took you away from God and something wasn't right from the very beginning but when the hardest the things come it should draw you even that much closer to God come on y'all believe that but what happens a lot of times many times people go through things and it draw them further away from God right they begin to doubt in God but you know one thing about job and all that he was going through he said the Lord give and he take away every every trial job went through it looked like it drew him closer to God right come on because the thing is you know that you got to you ever come to that point in your life and I know I have all the time that God is my only hope and salvation amen come on when things falling apart if I if I draw away from him or he draws away from me then that's like what else what else do I have I have no other options but God right come on though he slay me yet I'll trust him I have no other options he's the only he's the only option that I have that I know that's going to be sure every time come on things everything else will fail but it's one thing I know that'll be sure every time yes and that's the Lord he gonna be sure every time come on he's gonna be solid like they say he going to be on your side he going to be solid every time even those times in those times where it seems like he's silent don't you know God is still working he's still working he's still moving I believe that Hallelujah come on but we find that what happens today like he says uh uh uh if I be a father where's my honor people don't honor God do they come on they don't honor him sometimes when they when they got it all think they healthy think they strong think they they all right they don't honor God right and God knows it that arrogant Spirit don't he he knows that people walk around with it don't they come on because and they what it is you know God God dwells in humility that's where he dwells at Hallelujah and that's something that we can't put on ourselves but we got to get lay before God and ask God to give us that Spirit of humility right to be able to walk before him because when he blessing you how easy it is when God blessing you to walk on the rooftop and say look at what all I've done right come on how easy it is to look out over the kingdom and look look at what all I've done right because God is blessing you but you want to stay in that place to where you know where your blessings come from come on God you want to stay in that place that where you walking and say Lord I know where my help come from Lord all my help come from you come on Lord thank you for what I got thank you what for what I don't have because you didn't need want me to have it Anyway come on but God no matter what let me walk humbly before you because I know one thing that these things are temporal right things can tomorrow they can take everything whatever you can have you can be lost tomorrow right laws change you lose your job everything tomorrow right then what does it you put your trust in those things but if you stir up Hallelujah where your heart is there where your treasure be I don't know about you but my heart is in the word hallelujah come on in the word of God not in church now come on not in a group but my heart is in God's word come on because that's where the that's where my treasure is that's where my hope Hallelujah lies in the word of God I believe that come on and you got to esteem that more than your necessary meat that's right come on you got to realize that everything you need or everything that that you can obtain good in this life you got to realize that it's locked up in this word hallelujah amen come on that you can draw from God that's what it is people thinking that they drawing from their job drawing from Money drawing all things but but those things will fail but when you drawing from that living well come on when you drinking from that living water that won't fail that's why when Things Fall Apart job lose whatever happens in your life people walk away from you come on situations change you still drawing from that well come on and that well won't run dry Hallelujah that well will give you Joy in the Midnight Hour yeah that that that well will give you peace Hallelujah in the midst of all the storm everybody turmoil what's going to happen next in the government all that we we we drinking from that living well Hallelujah and in that well is peace Hallelujah we in this world but we ain't of the world we in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Hallelujah governed by a whole another kingdom y'all believe that amen come on but it's got to be valuable to you amen come on what what it is you know the people in that day they had a they had something they were saying in their heart and God God heard him God heard their heart he said yeah have I loved you right and they said God heard them because they were saying Lord when you love them cuz they were looking at their present condition right and he said I want you I want to tell you something now he said I love Jacob but I hated Esau hallelujah look at look at your brother look at where where your brother at look at where you could have been but look at where I blessed you at Hallelujah come on but you had a problem when I blessed you you wouldn't give me no honor come on when I blessed you you wouldn't bless me back hallelujah how you going to bless God back with his praise with your praise come on I I bless you you wouldn't even clap your hands Hallelujah you wouldn't even lift your voice you wouldn't even pray and cry to me when I blessed you gave you a voice you wouldn't even use it right right but you used it to do other things with didn't you come on I was sharing with the the kids the children the other day I said what if God did us like we do him come on oh I forgot to pray this morning what if God forgot to wake you up this morning come on what if he forgot to breathe the Breath of Life in you this morning what if he forgot to be with you when you was on the dangerous highways traveling down the road come on but one thing about God he don't forget he's always on guard Hallelujah he's always on post watching when you slumbering and sleeping God Is Watching come on you going about carelessly forgot all about him God is still watching he don't do us like we do him come on and I'm so glad but I say God when I forget bring my memory back hallelujah hallelujah when I when I when I forget God bring it back to me Hallelujah when you bless me bring me back to praise God come on how many want that tonight come on I was sharing someone the other week I said you know the thing about it is when you talking about uh uh uh uh sacrifice and offerings a lot of times people talk about tithes and things right but I says one thing about it a lot of times people struggle right with that 10% don't they God bless you with so much and all he asking for is 10 right and people struggle with it right and then I said go ahead struggle with it I said but the car going to break down come on pipe going to bust under the house all kind of things going to happen right but what it is you curse yourself with a what curse didn't you that's the word of God ain't it come on but people oh that area is hard right but the thing about it is God want to bless you how many believe God want to bless them tonight come on God want to bless you Hallelujah he don't want you to be Cur curse but sometime you got no he had no other choice you curse yourself don't you come on but I don't know about you but I want to live in the blessings of God where I fa to Lord help me to get back on the right Road Hallelujah that's what I desire tonight but I said sacrifice and offerings what it is a lot of times you know when you talking about sacrifices people make sacrifices right but just because you making a sacrifice that don't mean that's what God want a lot of times you make sacrifices in the name of the Lord but you want it do it because it's your own benefit right y'all believe that people do it I'm making this sacrifice but in your heart you doing it because you you want to benefit something right come on and God know that God can see one thing about God we can play we can pull the the cover over everybody but not God that's one person one person you God looking God looking at it just like how it is naked open right come on but you know I I says we want to make sacrifices but but it not being in God's will but but just cuz you make a sacrifice that don't mean God got accepted but the problem today is people make sacrifices and they they tell God what he need to accept come on and then God say and accept it then they get upset don't they I did all this and I did all that but that ain't what God wanted come on God know what he want yes and you know what God want Hallelujah God want his word don't he he says he says does the Lord Delight in sacrifices and offerings come on rather than obeying the voice of God right Hallelujah come on somebody say Amen tonight come on now the hearken come on it's better ain't it ain't that the Bible come on but we got a problem today with people obeying God's word ain't it come on that's what you know we we find that all over the place don't you people want to give sacrifice they want to give God what they want and think he ought to accept it I thought about Cain Cain he gave God he made a sacrifice it wasn't that he didn't make one he made one didn't he but it wasn't what God wanted but Abel he made one Hallelujah and God can smile on him I can see God tell Cain you see that that that's what I love Hallelujah you do what your brother doing and I accept you ain't that what God told him but instead of him giving God what he want Hallelujah instead of him giving God what God wanted he got mad with his brother I want to give him what I want to give him right but God wasn't accepting that was he and that's what happens today God bless people hallelujah because they giving God what he want and God tell you come on you got to give me more your time more your time in prayer Hallelujah more your time in sincerity you got to give me more and I'll bless you people get upset cuz everybody around them being blessed and they say why a god telling you how to get blessed I need more Hallelujah more of you Hallelujah more of your dedication more of your time come on Hallelujah I was telling someone the other I mean the church the other day I said you know sometimes God just be want to spend time with you amen come on I says what it is he wake you up sometime in the middle of the night come on and we get up and do all kind of other stuff but God want to spend time with you I said riding down the road in the car you know God want to spend time with you sometime right a lot of time I said people don't believe God is like that God is so he no God want to spend time with you amen come on God want to just talk to you he already know your problems and your struggles but he just want to talk to you Hallelujah and encourage you then everything going to be all right come on sometimes just in that little talk you have with God he helps you refocus on some things right come on where you done drifted off God helps you refocus come on Amen that you got all these things bogging you down and weighing you down your blood pressure up and all everything else come on but just talking it over with God God just gives you that comfort and that assurity Hallelujah and don't you worry about these things I'm going to take care of them Hallelujah you don't have to stay up all night worrying about that I got it all under control come on I'm the Lord hallelujah I like how he told I believe it was Abraham is there anything too hard for the Lord God when he speaks to you he's talking to you he reminding you sometimes come on but God want to spend time do you have time for God come on I say today the church world don't have time for God they put him out didn't they come on yes sir I was talking the other day I was I was with the Bible study with the children I was saying you know the thing about it is I says that you know they God God made the after the rain in no days he put a rainbow in the sky didn't he and he said it'll be a covenant between him and man that he won't destroy the Earth by water no more right come on so I don't know I said I'm telling the children I said every time I see a rainbow it stirs me up that's a supernatural sign that God still kept his word from then until now I says but you know when you ask the children of somebody about the rainbow today they talking about a pot of gold and a leprechaun come on and all kind of other stuff was talking about Easter I said how they how I said what if Jesus sitting in church and on on Good Friday and Easter Sunday and everybody worri about Easter baskets and Easter eggs come on traded that time was supposed to be celebrated as a as a something for him right come on sacred time representing his death burial and Resurrection right and a great thing that he did for you and I Hallelujah they pierced his hands and his feet didn't they he was whipped crowned with a crown Thorns but he did it all because you and I if he didn't do it Hallelujah you wouldn't be able to make it into the kingdom amen was was fit for the Judgment died go to hell right but he came down from Glory didn't he amen hallelujah came down to go through all of that for you and I didn't he amen come on that ought to be when that time or when all of it we celebrate it every day right we thank God for it every day amen but that time is it's a sacred Time Lord thank you for what you did for me come on I said when the last time you thank God for dying for you when the last time you thank God for for doing what he did Hallelujah cuz if he hadn't done what he did don't you know we wouldn't even be here tonight come on because of what he did right Hallelujah we only here because of what he did but today people Minds ain't on that all right Hallelujah where they Minds on Easter Easter bunnies and eggs like Aaron say chocolate eggs come on but that's what the devil did ain't it traded Christmas what they call it Christmas we know all that how that go Santa Claus right people that just just took I said Jesus you you you Jesus sitting in church today right and every Everybody mind on everything else but him right come on his name ain't even called don't even talk about Jesus right everything else but Jesus amen come on there ain't no church without Jesus y'all believe that amen come on he is the sinner Hallelujah he is the reason we gather together amen is to worship him and tell him thank you amen hallelujah y'all believe that come on but we find today like we say the people Minds have gotten all the way from that haven it come on gotten all the way Char Charlotte was telling me the other day she said she ain't never saw it before but they was having uh uh a best dress contest in the church say the brothers Brothers was coming up by the altar in their suits and they was I guess judging who the best dressed brother was in church I said no the like the prophet of God was saying he was saying it took the the the the Catholic Church A Thousand Years 2,000 years to get in the shape that it's saying he says but at the rate the Pentecost and all going the day he says it'll take way less than that because of the drifting right but you think sometimes you say what what what if you know Jesus he's sitting there Jesus sitting there looking at that going on right come on how do you think that make Jesus feel Hallelujah come on but you can't say nothing about it can you because why people have go Minds have gone so far away Jesus ain't The Sinner no more Hallelujah but he's going to be the cner in
