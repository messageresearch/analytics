those that are here touch those that are watching Lord Jesus and Lord we ask that you come in our midst Lord speak to every need Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to you turn to the Book of Luke Luke chapter 15. when we start at verse 11. very familiar scripture if you got it say man amen and it reads Luke chapter 15 verse 11 and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that followed to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the youngest son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with righteous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and when he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent for sent him into this field to feed swine and he would feign have filled his belly with the husk that the swan did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have bred enough to end to Spirit I perish in our Parish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee amen God bless the reading of this word may be seated amen amen I like to speak on a little topic this morning said if not now then when if not now then when and look at verse 15 and verse 6 15 he said and he went and joined himself to citizen of that country he was sent him into the field to feed swine in verse 16 he would feign to fill his belly with the hust that the swan did eat and no man gave unto him and I was looking at description it came to me if not now then when and this if you know the story it was about we call it the prodigal son and there were two sons and one he went out and he lived his life but he got into hard times and he had to make a decision he had to decide whether he wanted to do what was right or continue to live the way that he was and I want to ask you the question if not now then when when is it going to be your time that you're going to turn and say I want to do what's right when is going to be the appropriate time for you to decide that I want to do what's right and as a subtopic I put down I said examine yourself see where you are and understand this young man he had to go through a time and he said he said I'm out here feeding the pigs I'm out here doing this and in my father's house this even the servants have food enough to spare he examined himself and he said why am I doing this why am I where I am today he was examining himself and he asked he might have asked himself the question if not now then when when is it going to be the import the time for me to turn when is it going to be the time for me to return to my father's house if not now and I'll come to this Crossroads where I'm out here and I don't have nothing to eat I want to eat with the pigs to eat now I know that's not good for me and he's saying if not now then when when am I going to turn to him when am I going to say that I need help when am I going to decide that I've done enough and that this is my turning point and each turning point is different he got down to his lowest moment but there are some examples of people that didn't get there but they realized they needed help see if not now then when it said in Ezekiel he said remember now God created in the days of thy youth if you turn to Ezekiel because I want to read the read the full scripture Ezekiel chapter 12 verse 1. Ezekiel chapter 12 and verse 1. it says remember now thy Creator in the days of thy used while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I not have no pleasure in him and while the Sun or the light of the moon or the Stars be not dark in nor the clouds returning to the Rain in the days when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinder cease because they are few and those that look out on the Windows be darkened and the door shall be shut in the streets when the sounds of grinding is low and he shall rise up at the voice of the birds and all the daughters of music shall be brought low and and let's drop down to the 13th board verse and he said let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments but this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil see here it says and sometimes it says examine yourself if not now then when it says that God's going to judge every man with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil so he gives you an opportunity to come to him to turn to him and to see and ask you the question if not now then when if not now if this isn't the moment then when it's going to be a good moment for you to turn when are you when is it going to be a good moment if this is not the moment then when when are you when it's going to be a good turn for you to examine yourself for you to see it say that I need to do right I need to do better and examine yourself and say lord it's me it's not anybody else it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer not just my mother my father but it's me sometimes we look at everyone else and we can see everyone else's faults but we can't see our own because we never examine ourselves because we never ask ourselves is it time for me to turn is the time for me to go in a different direction maybe everyone else is going and that may seem right for them but it's not it's not right for you it's and it says I wrote something down and said here that says it's easy to slide down a hill but it takes strength and resolve to climb up it sometimes it's easy when you're going downhill it's easy to run fast it takes a lot more strength and takes a lot of the heart to run up a hill you got to struggle sometimes you got to focus on times you got to figure out where am I going to put my feet and and where am I going to this might not be solid ground but I want to stand on Solid Ground and says sometimes the devil make it seems easy to say yes to sin and the more you say yes the easier it becomes and the faster you slide and the harder it becomes to stop but no one can cause you to stop but no one can cause you to stop and start climbing back up even though the hill is steep you don't have to depend on your strength and you can depend on the one who said I will never leave you nor forsake you I Am With You Always even until the end of the world see sometimes when you're sliding down the hill it's easy and and it becomes easier the worthy you slide because you get faster you get faster the longer you slide you get faster if it's a big enough Hill you keep going and you get faster and they feel good the wind blowing in your face and you're going you're going but it's hard to stop but all it takes is one moment just for you to ask yourself if not now then when is enough enough when is enough enough when am I going to say no when am I going to say no when am I going to stop and think about when is enough enough when am I going to think about if not now then when when am I going to ask myself when is my stopping point because you you continue to go and you continue to go and you continue to go it's hard to say no it's hard to stop once you go down certain Journeys and certain Pathways and that's why I came to the scripture remember now that I created in the days of thy youth because it's easier when you're in your youth it's easier because of the exposure that you have in life and God allows you to to choose him now that ask yourself if not now then when why are you young you haven't been exposed and you can't return from things that you've done and God God allows you to say choose him down choose him now you can examine yourself and say Lord I want you now I want to make the decision if not I want to make today is my win today is my turning point today is an opportunity for me to change and grow from where I am and said something I used to hear when I when I was growing up the older people they would say that they would say there was something that I wrote down and said the devil will take you further than you ever thought you would go the devil will take you further that you ever thought you would go because he takes you on a journey down a hill he never tells you that when you get to the bottom there's a lake of fire he never tells you that once you slide down farther enough the fire is going to get hotter and hotter and you can't climb back up you can't get out of that Hill once you go there but Jesus Is providing a way of Escape he's inviting a way to say that that if you stop I'm going to help you climb back up that hill I'm gonna carry you up the hill where you thought it was your strength but it was his strength where you thought it was you was going to do it and he said I'm going to bring you through it it was him that was carrying you that's going to lead you and guide you up that hill see but the devil makes it easier he tries to make it easier and something I used to hear that I wrote down and said that if you lie you were still they used to say if you then if you're still you were killed and people's like why why are you being so dramatic that's not how it happens what what I wrote down and said but sometimes you don't know where the simplest things can lead because as you go each time you make a wrong decision it's like sliding down a hill it becomes easier and anything that you practice anything that you do often enough it's like practicing it you're gonna get better at it you're gonna get better at it even wrong things you're gonna get better at it because it becomes easier to you because you're sliding down a hill that you seem that you can't stop on and it becomes easier to you as you go when you keep going but the smallest things you never know what I can leave and people's like well well for example I'll give you an example saying well I only took a dollar out the purse my mama purse so and people just well that was nothing all I wanted was some candy and she said no so I only took a dollar that was an example but no one ever told you that one day you may end up robbing bigger and better things because of one simple decision that you made when you were young one simple decision that you made that you said well that's not where it's going to go but then if if you keep going you're going to get better at it that's why they said stay away from Evil things stay out of ways of trouble that's why people lead you and guide you and say this is the right way don't do these certain things that's why God put laws in the Bible that we wouldn't do certain things so that we could stay away from sliding down those those Hills sliding down the hill where we couldn't return from and wonder why we got to where we are but there's this is just an example of one small thing that can lead to so many greater things because once you do something and you repeat it you become better at it and it becomes easier to do so make sure that you're doing the right things ask yourself if not now then when ask yourself you might get away with it now but one day it'll catch up to you what's done in the dark one day it'll come to the light one day it's going to come before you and you're going to have to face the Judgment for the sins that you have done whether on Earth or in heaven it's going to come that day and you're going to have to face it well Lord Lord and he going to play it before you and say did you do this and there's no way you can deny it so if not now then when when are you going to make the positive decision that I want to do better will it be tomorrow will it be next week will it be 10 years from now but what if you don't have that time what if you don't have the time to make that decision in the future what if today is your last day what is this moment after this service is over for you and you no longer get to ask yourself if not now then when you don't get to examine yourself anymore because you're no longer here you no longer can breathe you no longer can do the things that you think that I'm young and I'm strong or I got plenty of time if not now then when when are you going to change when are you going to decide that enough is enough when are you going to say to yourself that I got to do something different I got to make this positive decision to do something different because today is my win this is my moment to change this is my moment when I can decide that Lord I want you to do something in my life Lord I want you to do something I want you to do something for me to change the way that I am I said a long time ago I caught a revelation I said you should only change for two people God and yourself because those are the only changes that that are last those are the only changes that when you make them you for yourself you try to make them last as long as possible but when God changes you there's nothing that you can do to reverse that one but you gotta want the change you gotta want to if you're sliding down the hill you gotta want to stop you got to want to make that positive decision that said this is my moment to make a decision that I'm I'm not going to do this anymore and even if you give it to God and say Lord you help me because I'm not strong enough to keep me from doing it myself I'm not strong enough to do this I'm not strong enough to to not do this Lord I need your help and God I know for sure that he will help you if you give it to him I'm a living witness that God will help you God will keep you God will if you give it to him he said what you buying on her I will bind in heaven he said what you loose on Earth I will loosen heaven so if you give it to him and say Lord I'm binding this and this is in your hands and God to take care of it God will help you through it he'll give you the strength he'll give you the result he'll give you the determination to make it through it he'll make sure that you have you have everything that you need to get through it and that little voice to come to you when you buy to do it and say no don't do this don't do this don't go don't go don't slide no more don't go back now don't take two steps backwards when God done brought you two steps forward God he gives you that voice something in you that says don't do that think about it don't do that look how far you come look how far he's brought you don't do that but you have to examine yourself you have to say what and make that decision for yourself or whether you want to slide further whether you want to go back down that Hill from when she came because you know which way that's going you know if you keep sliding you know where that's going you know it's not you may not know exactly where it may end up but you know it won't end up in a good thing you know it won't end up where you think it may end up in a positive direction if you continue to go at some point in time you got to ask yourself if not now then when if not now if this isn't my moment for change then when it will be my moment will it be next week will it be 10 years from now but what if you don't have the time what if you don't have the time that you think you do what it what if tomorrow Putin decides that he wants to start a nuclear war and you don't have that time what are tomorrow tomorrow you wake up and people are gone that you once remember what what what if that those moments happen and you don't have the time to examine yourself anymore you don't have the time to say I got so much more time to live before these days happen I got so much more time to live before these things take place that's why we all have to examine ourselves daily and say Lord if not now then when when am I going to when am I going to believe that God would do what he said he would do when am I going to believe Lord that you're going to do exactly what you promised to do in your in your word Lord you promise to heal Lord you promised to deliver you promised to set free Lord you promised to to to save those that need to be saved Lord you promise to do these things so if not now then then when when can I believe that God will fulfill his promises to me when can I believe that God will fulfill his promises to me I don't have to wait for a long future I can believe now I can believe now that God will do what he said he will do yeah I can believe now that God will do exactly what he said he would do in his word because he said that if his word came out of his mouth it can't return to him void and James he says faith without works is dead so even though you may have faith you still got to put in the works even though you may believe you still got to do something you got to enact on that Faith say Lord I believe in you but I got to have some actions behind it I got to say Lord if not now then when when am I going to put my actions behind my face when am I going to do and truly believe that all things are possible if I only believe all things are possible if I only believe so if not now then when I need to examine myself and say Lord examine me David said created me a clean heart oh Lord and renew a right Spirit In Me and Paul said I Die daily it's something that we have to do is examine ourselves and ask ourselves if not now then when if not now then when all it takes is you believing and acting on it and God can do more it can do exceedingly abundantly then we can ask other things all it takes is you believing and acting on it and God can do exceedingly abundantly that we can ask or think all it takes is you believing and acting on it see that's sometimes we believe but we don't act sometimes we act but we don't believe but it takes the combination of the two for God to do exceedingly abundantly that we can ask a thing I said there was someone in the Bible if you know the story there was a story of man named Moses who who grew up and was raised in Pharaoh's house but he was a he was an Israelite he was a Hebrew but God had placed a special gift on his life and he was he one day he thought he was going to be the second in command and to be a pharaoh one day but God didn't have that for his life and he said and I want to read something and and Moses he killed an Egyptian so he had to flee he had to flee Egypt at one point in time and then he got on the backside of the desert and said now we found out that Moses now when he was out there he 40 years he had trained himself knowing by by his mother that he was to deliver the children to Israel and he thought surely when he killed the Egyptian that the brothers would understand it but they didn't so through all of his scheme he failed and miserably failed but in five minutes in the presence of a burning bush out there God put more into him than the Seminary did down there in 40 years see Moses he had to come to that point and God said if not now then when he said he promised that he would deliver his children of Israel and he had the person but he had to wait until Moses was was ready he had to wait until Moses was prepared he had been through enough that he realized that it wasn't Moses strength anymore it was God it was God that was going to lead him through it it was God that was going to bring him through it it was God that he he started to examine himself in front of that that burning bush and he said Lord I'm not strong enough I my speech I can't talk Lord he examined himself but he realized he realized that if this was the time if not now then when and then later on he said and but when God appeared to him there in the burning bush the next day human support sapora sitting straddled a mule with the young and inner on a hip and a white beard hanging down to his waist his bald head shining and a stick in his hand going through through there glory to God his eyes looking over and she would ask him she said where are you going Moses we're going down to Egypt to take over a one-man invasion all it takes is one all it takes is one person to say Lord if not now then when Lord this is my time this is my opportunity I can be a one-man Invasion I can be a one-man Wrecking Crew I can just I can believe that God can use me to do exceedingly abundantly more than I ever thought or asked and believed that he could do but I know he can because Moses he decided that he had come to the point if not now then when even though I may be old even though I thought it was in my youth but now it's my turn to ask if not now then when and I can turn to them I can depend on them I can believe let God to see me through I can believe that no matter what he's going to bring me through but Moses had to examine himself he had to examine himself and look at him and say look and realize that he couldn't do anything he he realized that I can't do anything I can't bring myself to do anything I'm not strong enough I don't have a speech I'm not wise enough I can't do anything but Lord and the Lord said you don't have to I'm going to do it he said I'm going to do it I'm going to deliver them not you see when Moses was young he thought I was strong I can do it and they're going to Rally or when I kill this Egyptian they're going to Rally around me and we're going to take over but that's not how God had it that's not how God had had it in mind he he had to wait until until Moses got on the backside of the desert and he waited till he was maybe in one of his lowest moments to show him not now if not now then when this is the time that you can examine yourself and realize that it's not you that's going to do it he's going to do it for you he's going to bring you out he's going to cause he's going to catch you on your slide and he's going to bring you back up that hill and he's going to take you further he's going to allow you to climb higher he's going to allow you to go even deeper and further in the places that you never thought that you would be because he's doing it it's not you doing it it's him doing it it's him bringing you up it's him reaching down and saying I know that you're down low but I'm gonna pick you up I'm gonna Carry You Higher I'm gonna carry you further I'm gonna bring you into places that you never thought that you would be because it's not you doing it it's him doing it but you got to come to the point that if not now when when am I going to believe that God can do this when am I going to believe that he's going to do this in my life not in someone else's life you see God you may see God working in others but when is he going to do it for me but you got to examine yourself and said Lord am I right am I doing what I need to do to be ready for you to do this for me yeah have I come to the point have I repented of my sin have I done these things that you said in your word that you would do and to them not believe have I do I do I actually believe ask a question do you do I actually believe and have I acted on it have I come to the point that I've that Solomon said in Proverbs he said trust in the Lord with all that heart then lean not to an unknown understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct our thy path be not wise in our own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil have I departed from evil have I turned from my Wicked Ways have I turned from the things that I was doing that wasn't pleasing in your sight have I made the positive decision that Lord I want to go all the way with you have I made the state Lord I want to come all the way completely and totally with you or am I trying to climb up the hill on my own am I trying to go up this hill by myself and not depend on his strength to keep me from falling because if I depend on mine I'm going to slip and fall I'm going to make missteps I'm going to step in the wrong place but if he carries me up he knows exactly where to go he knows how to bring me he knows how to take me he knows how to move this out of the way he can move that out of the way he can carry me further and higher than I ever thought that I would potentially go by myself and many of times we try to do it for ourselves but God said I'm waiting for you to stop so I can do it for you I'm waiting for you to stop so I can bring it for you so I can work it all out for your good I can do these things for your good but if not now then when when are you going to stop when are you going to say that enough is enough what are you going to say no when are you going to look at yourself and say no and say this is enough I'm not going any further this is enough God is going to handle this for me God is going to do this for me it's not my strength but it's his strength it's not my will but it's his will it's not what I want but what you want Lord in every aspect of my life in every part of my life so if not now then when when are you going to make that decision each of us have to make that this each of us get the opportunity to make that decision each and every day that you are alive you get the opportunity to make the right decision you get the opportunity to say Lord I want you to work in my life Lord I Want You To Be My All In All I Want You To Be My Savior I want you to be my friend Lord I want you to be the My Savior and my God the one that I depend on each and every day but sometimes we think that we got so much longer we got so much longer to live but I ask you to examine yourself and ask yourself the question if not now then when when will I turn and do what you want me to do Lord when will I decide that enough is enough when will I decide to say no because each of us had that opportunity to say it to each of us had that opportunity that God places in our lives for you to come forward and say Lord today is my day today is my day to turn to you today is my day to give you everything today is my day to say Lord you deserve it all Lord you deserve it all of the glory you deserve it everything Lord you deserve my life Lord I'm nothing without you giving me the breath to breathe every single morning I'm nothing without you making my lungs expand making my heart beat I'm nothing if you don't give me that Lord Jesus so Lord I want to give you everything that you've given to me because I know you will do exceedingly and abundantly more than I can ever ask anything so Lord I want to examine myself and each and every one of us have to do that each and every day Lord examine ourselves like David said Lord create in me a clean heart and renewal rights Spirit In Me because David came to the poor place and he said Lord I know that I've sinned I've done some things that wasn't right in your eyes but Lord if if I'm not going to wait till tomorrow to turn to you I'm not going to wait till the next day Lord I want you to do it now I want you to do it today Lord amen and I know it won't be easier tomorrow but I know that you'll be here with me I know that you're going to be here with me so I can ask myself if not when if not now then when and my win is right now my chance to change is right now my opportunity to say Lord I want you is right now and Lord I want you to move in my life and be the head of my life is right now I don't have to wait till tomorrow I don't have to wait till next week I don't have to wait till things come in life until opportunities come to to moments come for me to realize the Lord I need you I can say that this morning Lord that I need you Lord I need you and I want you to come into my life Lord I want you to to rest inside of me as I examine myself I said maybe maybe we may not be where we want to be but we thank God we're not where we used to be but see there's more opportunities for us to grow each and every day there's more opportunities for us to grow there's more opportunity for us to realize that Lord we need you Lord we need you each and every day we need you and and say Lord if not now then when ask yourself if not now if this is not my moment then when will my moment come when will I decide that that enough is enough when will I decide that I'm going to stop when will I decide that I'm going to say no it is no other moment then in the moment the moment can be today let us all stay in this moment [Music] Amen Let Us bow [Music] Lord Jesus Lord we come before you today in Lords to ask that you come in our midst Lord Jesus Lord as we sit here

question to those that are here this morning if you want today to be your moment today to be the opportunity for you to come to him and for you to change then I ask that you'll just lift your hands all heads about my eyes closed and give you the opportunity to say Lord I want to change Lord I examine myself and say Lord I want to give you everything I want to give you my life I want to change
