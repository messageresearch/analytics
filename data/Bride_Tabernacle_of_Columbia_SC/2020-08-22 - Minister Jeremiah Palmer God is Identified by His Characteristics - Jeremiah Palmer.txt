honor in jesus name amen amen amen it's good to be in the house of the lord and amen you have your bibles of you turn with us to the book of hebrews hebrews 1 i want to speak just a little thought for a few minutes pray that it'll be a blessing to us tonight in jesus christ's name hebrews 1 and 1. it reads god who at saundry times in indirect manners spaking time passed unto the fathers by the prophets half in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory in the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down or right hand of the majesty on high let us pray father god we want to thank you tonight for your word god lord oh word lord lord let it live let it find a resting place god i pray that you bless it now in jesus name amen and amen maybe seated i want to use for a little thought just for a few minutes tonight on god is identified by his characteristics are the characteristics of god we understand that basically everything can be identified by its characteristics you know i was thinking about adam when he named everything there must there was something that adam saw in the animal life pertaining said let's just take the animal life that he began to name the different animals they there was something about the characteristic of the animals that that adam just drew his conclusion to do special when it comes to a dog being that he was the very express image of god before the fall adam had dominion he had authority he had power because he was the very expressed image of god and i was just looking and thinking about each and every one of us here tonight within us from our natural family line there are a certain characteristics that identified us with the palmers are whatever your name that may be you are identified by the characteristics of the family trait sometimes though characteristics are not good but yet you got to be identified with it because it's in your bloodline and thinking about jesus christ he was the very express image of god characteristics on earth his life that he lived uh he never lived it for himself but he always was saying that i only do what the father showed me he lived a life to express god to that particular generation in which he lived yet they missed him they couldn't recognize that he was god on earth in flesh to reconcile the world back to god again and his entire life was a life of complete sacrifice not for himself but he lived it for others what he was doing portraying that god's image that the life that god wanted to lay down was for the human race to reconcile the people back to god again and looking at the old testament saints and the prophets of all and the types and the shadows that their very life was expressing the characteristics of god especially joseph and moses and the prophets the things that they did how they uh uh just gave their life for israel even though god wanted to destroy them they threw their life in between god and the people to what were they doing portraying the characteristics of god and i'm took this message from god as identified by a characteristic there are some things that i really want to try by god's grace to just bring out tonight to show you and i that you can do no more than what's in you to do but notice as our natural birth brought us characteristics of palmers and one guy that i was cutting on my brother grass and he always said you know he said man if i had blindfold he said you know i was really mistaking you for being larry because y'all talk alike why because it's the characteristics it's something from birth from the natural and i didn't have to try to make myself do that and you don't have to make yourself be whoever you are it's already in you by nature and you know i find this screen because a lot of times without doing a little series but i find we struggle uh sometimes our people struggle sometimes to actually produce a christian life and the only way that could be done there got to be a supernatural experience that takes place on the inside of you because i'm i'm seeing more now that you can learn about god and you can learn how you ought to live and how you ought to talk but uh if it's not coming from the inside you only are acting something that you know you ought to be like it but it hasn't fully been or developed yet because of a nature change and i i'm learning more and more that god uh his full requirements is for us is to be in his image not palmer's image because that image won't get you very far some images we have of people and you know how people are they they want to be identified with certain people because of their characteristics or maybe of a certain uh brand name of clothing that they wear because that you you look like you got something and most of the time you don't you just have a piece of clothing that you bought that somebody else made and it makes you identify that hey look at me and it don't get you nowhere you feel good about it but then when that is over you got to find another image and we go through images to to be identified with which sometimes uh how we look or how we dress or or what we drive or where we live and the god he said that doesn't move me one bit what i'm looking for is for a change that is not natural but it's a supernatural change and it's only even in our good in our best effort that we try uh you know to be more like god because of humanistic efforts we find ourselves struggling and coming short but i'm learning that it's not how we struggle but it's how much you can yield see it's uh it's letting uh uh god have preeminence you know and in this age we find out that people can really put on some acts but the servant of god say normally when pressure comes off a trial come it brings out the real you you can pretend to be something but something about pressure something about suffering and trial it really brings out even the characteristics of god or the characteristic of your natural birth that's why i i see more and more that you've got to be born again cause without that you'll be trying and i talked to people they said i'm trying brother jeremiah i'm trying so hard but every time i try i keep failing and i say sister brother you have to fail because it's not in you trying because god already done it you accept it by faith and then let god take over i believe yes there has to be a you willingness that uh god wants preeminence and you give him the preeminence lord that whatever god that's not in me that's not right lord move it because i want to be like you and the only way you can be like god is to have the nature of god and already have the nature of god is to be born again then if we are really born again by the spirit of god see because we're understanding now that you know i'm really rejoicing because i'm looking at god's characteristics and how god is trying to mold us and to shape us not what we want to be but what he wants us to be and the quicker we realize that that life you have don't belong to you it belongs to him and god wants to come in and abide in you and we've got to let god do all the work sometimes we just want him just to be a savior but we don't want him to be the ruler that he won't control of your entire life that's why the bible said seek ye first the kingdom of god and all his righteousness and all these other things will be added to you and the more we realize that uh god knows what's best for us i learned that we can try it our way and we'll found out you just make a mess out of it all because god ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher see what god did for us that we're not recognizing that even before you were even born god already knew you and there are certain things that that god put in us you know before the foundation in the world god planted a seed and that seed if it's the right seed or if the wrong seed it got to bring forth of the kind it is i've been looking for go up me to become genesis i've been looking for this the other night and couldn't find it not couldn't find it really i just been looking over it genesis 1 you know i i hear i i used to hear and still hearing that how that we ought to be resting in god why rest because in him is complete see we sometimes and as you know to understand uh that's nature of man human people we're always trying to find out uh what to do with our life and we'll do this and do that and do everything else except ask god we try to be a muslim we are trying to be this we try to be a atheist we are trying to be a hip-hop we try to be cool we try to be slain we thought all these avenues and yet it's laying right there that god created us for his own glory and when god created he wanted you and i to understand that i made you a son and a daughter of god stop struggling to be like oprah or these superstars be like mike be like lebron be like tyson be like all of these fallen stars why not be like jesus and be like everybody else sometimes we want to be like the palmers or be like somebody else who we think is great and there's nobody great amongst us no nobody you know and i have to confess it because that i remember years back in 89 you know that how when i first you know were coming to mullins and uh they were having meetings all over and i'm new you know like a new kid on the block and and i'm going about you know seeing the meetings and the people preaching and and man and these guys were so swell you know speaking and everybody was running and jumping and hauling and and myself i still i wonder sometimes do they really know what they're hollering about you know i always will one you know my wife get up she said that my son's real like me that we just quiet people in this city and look you know because i believe in deserving things and i kind of sometimes won't know whether or not it's real or do we understand what we are excited about now i believe we ought to be excited but at least know what you excited about you know somebody say you know uh don't jump no higher than you live you know but when you get something in you and you know that uh he's there and then you got a right you know to to jump you're not just jumping because sometimes people move because other people move one shout and know somewhere i'm gonna shout but no it's because that yes we got something to be shouting about everyone because god has truly did a marvelous work in this hour and the servant of god said that we ought to be the most happiest people on earth why because we understand now by the opening of the word that the fullness of god has been made known to us all that god ever wants to do and written in his word he made it known in this generation no other generation had that they had it in parts they had you know a little here and a little dead because god always makes his word known to the people of that particular age but in this age here he had uh made all that he ever uh awarded or to express you to us his hour he opened the book and he expressed himself that i created you to be in my image oh lord have mercy when when we understand that you are not just a painter or electrician or never know a nurse you are a son and a daughter of almighty god oh my what an honor and a privilege to be able to have the very characteristics of god tabernacling in your mortal body that's what the devil don't want us to understand we're not just playing churches we that is going through a message but we expressing the very characteristics of god in this thing see this day this scripture is being fulfilled right in our ears your very life oh my disciples one time uh begin uh somebody asked them and they said sir we would see jesus and i believe there's still a desire most people didn't really want to see god and god always veiled himself in earthly vessels but the characteristics the several gods of god are not natural but they are supernatural i believe every child of god that's born of his spirit they got to have the supernatural why because it's in them the character very characteristics of god is is pushing out and saying that give me more i'm expecting more you know my daughter's on that i'm expecting great things that's how we ought to be but why because the characteristics of god it begins to make you push out because there's something in you that that wants to be expressed what is it god in you expressing the very supernatural manifestation of god for your particular hour oh lord you know what i've been saying lately i think you know we use you know uh hear people say it a lot but it's true and you notice this the little slogan that we use but now slowly it is actually said all that was in god he poured it into christ and then all that was in christ he poured it into church i'll be like my family i say but i'll say that do we have those things and if we do why are we not expressing it it's because a lot of times lack of understanding who we are when you recognize who you really are what this world is doing and what's going in it don't even phase you because within you is deity it's god you know life that's that's in you that that that you are no longer just earthbound people but you're in heavenly places you're in another dimension though we see you here but you are somewhere else you know you are living in heavenly atmosphere you are living in an age that where all things are possible everybody else sitting looking say well when is a disc going to happen when is that going to happen it's happening people always missed it the great move of god what the church ought to be in power the characteristics you know and uh the spoken word let me read you this one i really want to get that out 1 11. and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind notice this whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth forth grass and herb eating seed after his kind and the tree-eating fruit excuse me whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good see so every seed in the word is a seed if that word be planted correctly in our lives it'll bring forth fruit your life ought to be a fruit tree because the seed of god the word you know abideth in you you know i i remember brother earnest preaching the song of the sermon about speaking why because that's what god used the spoken word and if that seed of god abide in us then there is a a season that god begin to move us into that kind of anointing go up me to the book of psalms 1. i'm thinking about i mean paul and peter those and how they we're talking about how god made uh the unsearchable riches you know the unsearchable riches of christ you know what now i'm i'm understanding now that there is a season that god does certain things it's like there's a season you plant certain things in the ground to grow and if you plant it out of season it'll die so at a certain season a good farmer knows when to plant collard greens he knows you know what it's going to take to get the very fruits of his labor and i believe god knows also see when god planted these seeds god is looking for fruits no man ever plant a garlic and don't look for any kind of harvest and i believe we're in the harvest time that every seed had ever been planted it got to come to maturity no matter what seed it is it got to come up to where are to be recognized psalm 1 1-3 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law does he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season see his leaf also should not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper in other words there is a sea it was a season that every word that was spoken by god it had to come to pass from the beginning of time god had seasoned that he dealt with adam and eve he dealt with abraham he dealt with moses he gave them a particular word for the season and for the generation that they were living and that word spoken by a prophet as hebrews said you know and they spoke the word of god for that particular hour the age that liveth could have rejoiced in that word for that hour because that was the very express image of god what he was expecting of them see and in every age you know you think about the um the church ages you know how god allowed it you know so much of his word to be made known through the seven church ages you know pieces of it the pieces of it you know but even every age starting from ephesus to laodicea if you knew uh understand the definition of of each aid there was a certain characteristics it was identifying that a certain spirit that was working in the ephesus age all down the layer laodicea and the people that live they had to deal with that particular spirit because it was affecting them and in this age of laodicea we have an age of people's rights or people's justice which is identifying the characteristics how the people are going to be conformed to but to the bride to those that understand that we don't belong to those things we were called out of that and we have called we've been called to a higher calling in this eight here god is looking for perfection he said being ye perfect as your fatherly father is perfect so god is calling for a higher calling than luther and wesley and all of those other ages it's the age of the full a manifestation of god characteristics in this hour if you don't mind me reading a little something god here seven was bringing out he was talking about matthew 24 how those uh two spirits were going to be so close that if it was possible it'll deceive their very lack but he said what identifies the two is the characteristics because god always identify himself through supernatural uh events even though that even in this hour you know we have twins it always has been like that you know uh start up with cain and abel you know esau and jacob you know it always was those so close uh look just like you know the real but yet folks but he said it's the characteristic that identifies it and here he was talking about uh israel and mohammed he said look as israel was in his journey coming up out of egypt now god was with israel he shown them a great sign down there sent a prophet to him and identified his written word and as he brought them up we watch his characteristics how he met moses and the things which he did and on the road there was up another nation which was moab now mohave was a great nation also not a heathen by no means he said that was a lot daughter's children and they were believers now watch the two nations one of them is recognized as a recognized nation the other one is just a sojourner now they come to the place that uh this great nation mohamed lays right straight in the line of their path of duty to go to the promised land you know remind me so much of judas that he went so far with them you know casting out the devils preaching and all of that but it came a time that judas never made it to pentecost why because his true colors showed and you know i believe it's going to be exactly the same you know though we have this two groups that look like twins and remind me of uh matthew 25 about the uh the 10 virgins both of them clean living people they were on a journey five took lamps with their oil and five took a lamp with no oil see what was it the characteristics the five wives knew that their journey may be long so they took extra oil i believe that's what it is today we ought to understand it's going to take extra holy ghost in this hour it's going to take more than just quoting what brother branham said it's going to take more than us just repeating what he said it's going to take the very power of the holy ghost with a double potion extra oil i'll be the bible say that his bride she made herself ready or she didn't wait till the preacher call it she understand that i got to have more than this i got to have more than just good sermon i need a revelation of god for myself and uh as the uh our foolish version uh realized at the end when the bridegoon came they rose up and found out their oil was gone and then they began to tell why give us of your oil they said no not so go pray up and get your own church it's an hour now you need to get prayed up i i can't never get away from it you know brother caleb said you know we don't know what's going to happen next but i believe we are about to say be ye ready how do you get ready seek him now don't wait to the next epidemic take advantage of that lord prepare me for whatever may come god i don't know what it might be lord but you got to keep me because if god don't keep us we are lost but it's going to take something within us that is crying out lord i can't just wait till i go to church lord but i need it now oh what an hour what an hour i believe that if we don't uh get refocused let's not just come to church like time pass but let's come to church with a purpose lord you gave us another chance now we know that it's coming that our doors are going to be closed shortly and they're not going to be reopened so i believe the bible say that as we see that they're approaching us we ought to assemble ourself the more you know it used to be a time that we didn't mind coming to church twice on sundays or whatever now it almost kill us we just don't have that drive like that and i was saying lord we need restoring we need something god a fresh outpouring of your spirit that will illuminate us but as elijah said we're not going to get it until we call for it we always want the pastor to call it why if your salvation built on him our brother earnest the brother jeremiah no so why wait you call for it you know what you need you know and nobody can do it but god so why wait they always say wait always break the wagon down wait till the next meeting we wait to the next gathering we wait to the next good preacher we just wait and i learned that even from experience i had you know but god had to rebuke me on it until getting to tell me you know why you wait to do something that i told you because i was trying to get more people involved you know how we all we feel like it ought to be a collective thing but if god revealed it to you and put it on your heart then you don't wait for nobody else you know you talk to the pastor and let them know what's on your heart you know what not and then you know you begin to proceed not just doing anything but we want to uh know what we're doing we want to have the right inspiration that god you put it on and if god put it on your heart then god will manifest it here want us to read a little bit more about this moab these two nations each each of them had a prophet moses and balaam both of them were prophets both of them had fundamental uh they built all tools they did exactly god's requirement you know building the seven ought i'm gonna skip down same altar same god but one of them was wrong and the other was right you know i understand one thing that if you write and if god you know god it's right what you did you don't have to debate with anybody because god are manifested god uh you know being wrong you know and trying to foster people about this and about that why leave them alone god justify if it's of god it'll come if it's not ain't gonna come to nothing see and it's god vindicating because if god called you and if god put it on your then god gonna manifest it there'll be fruits of your labor not just doing something you know like popping up with deals and that no you you want uh something direct from god because too many times we have had too many shipwrecks and that's what people are like they are now so much shipwrecked people now can't even distance what's right and what's wrong he said this there he said now the only way that you could tell which was when it comes fundamental to the word both of them were right but you see one his motives and that's one thing you already have to check what are your motives why are you doing what you're doing what's the purpose of it for glory of your own self or for glory of god and you know like i said we got some real good actors in this hour one his mortal was wrong he was trying to cut off his brother from the line of promise that god had gave him another thing one of the prophet of balaam was fundamental but the prophet moses was identified by characteristics of god there was a pillar of fire supernatural light hanging over them and there was a great healing in their camp supernatural god showing supernatural signs and they were staying right exactly with the word of promise that god gave abraham back in the time both nations started but now notice moses had abraham's promise going to the promised land balaam also had a prophet of the lord stand there in the only way you could identify not from their fundamental teaching but by the characteristics of god see only he said there was a a sound of shout of the voice of the king down in the camp with here the atonement was there it was in effect a brass serpent see all the supernatural characteristics of god was being made manifest to identify who was right and who was wrong and i believe that if those characteristics existed then it's the same characteristics now why because hebrews 13 8 it said that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if that is then god characteristics is still being made manifested not another jesus not another god not three gods but one god with three uh manifestation see making himself known to the people of that particular generation and god will have those characteristics even today on display god bless you tonight praise god god is identified by his own characteristics we thank the lord let us bow our heads let us stand father in the precious name of jesus christ knowing that you're the same god yesterday today and failed them lord you said accent shall be given seek and you shall find you said knock on the door shall be opened lord we pray today that there's a heart the need you lord lord all they have to do is yield surrender lord we know what you all think are possible we know it's not anything too hard for you to do so lord god thanks you to look out upon this audience this people lord lord if there's a need lord lord hallelujah all you got to do is open your heart up all you got to do is call on it oh hallelujah somebody oh god lord that's dining out and have a need wanted to just ask jesus to come in what did you ask him lord i need healing i need
