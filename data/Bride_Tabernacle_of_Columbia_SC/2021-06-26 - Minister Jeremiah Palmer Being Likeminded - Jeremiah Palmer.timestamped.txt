[30:32] i had a little
[30:36] shelter tells the one right before you
[30:38] turn to the book of philippians
[30:40] the second chapter of philippians
[30:43] and uh give you a little short testimony
[30:46] one of the brothers
[30:47] bob there at the church day marion
[30:50] what i've been actually going to pray
[30:52] for he was suffering with cancer
[30:55] and he had um two rising
[30:58] one was real big on one side and other
[31:02] was
[31:02] getting big on the other side and he
[31:05] also was suffering with
[31:06] his stomach was enlarged with it was
[31:09] kind of affection
[31:11] um that he was dealing with and they
[31:13] diagnosed with cancer
[31:15] and he tell me a lot of times that he
[31:17] couldn't sleep at night at all basically
[31:19] he sits up
[31:20] sleeping and about one or two hours a
[31:23] night
[31:24] and i talked to him yesterday he was at
[31:27] the hospital
[31:29] leaving the hospital and going home and
[31:31] he said
[31:32] he was kind of still kind of shortness
[31:34] of breath
[31:35] he's doing some chemo but he was saying
[31:37] that both of the rising has been
[31:40] has gone and his stomach had then
[31:43] went out so i said he was just praising
[31:46] the lord he said you see
[31:47] sunday brother jeremiah it's gone it's
[31:50] gone
[31:51] so i said well thank the lord amen amen
[31:54] knowing that god is still a waymaker
[31:56] amen
[31:57] appreciate that in jesus christ's name
[32:00] because philippians the second chapter
[32:12] one through five
[32:16] if there be therefore any consolation in
[32:19] christ
[32:21] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[32:25] of the spirit
[32:27] if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my
[32:31] joy
[32:33] that you be like-minded having the same
[32:36] love
[32:37] being of one accord of one mind
[32:41] let nothing be done through scrift or
[32:44] vainglory
[32:45] but in lowliness of mind
[32:48] that each esteem others better than
[32:51] themselves
[32:53] look not on every man or his own things
[32:56] but every man also on the things of
[32:58] others
[33:00] let this mind be in you which was also
[33:04] in christ jesus let us pray father we
[33:07] thank you for the reading of your word
[33:09] sanctified
[33:10] in jesus name amen may be seated
[33:17] just for a few minutes tonight
[33:24] i was reading
[33:27] the book of romans where i actually
[33:29] started from
[33:30] romans 15.
[33:34] and it's kind of caught my attention
[33:37] and i thought you know
[33:40] that it may be something to be of just
[33:43] exalt for a few minutes tonight
[33:47] and i entitled it like-minded
[33:51] like-minded
[33:55] when you think of mine
[33:59] webster says having a like
[34:04] disposition or purpose
[34:07] of the same mind
[34:10] or habit of thought
[34:14] having a like disposition
[34:17] or purpose
[34:21] as we read it and i
[34:24] was thinking on the early
[34:28] church in the very life of jesus christ
[34:34] which i believe is our prime example
[34:41] paul said he had to let this mind be in
[34:43] us that was in christ
[34:49] and i like it because he said that
[34:56] having the same love
[35:00] in other words the love of god
[35:04] in the love of god is it partial
[35:11] the bible says for god so love the world
[35:16] he gave his only begotten son
[35:20] not a respectable person that god just
[35:24] but he died for the sins of the whole
[35:27] world
[35:29] he gave himself
[35:33] even for those that will reject him
[35:40] in other words he would display that i
[35:43] just didn't come for the righteous or
[35:45] for this but he gave everybody an
[35:49] opportunity to accept the love that he
[35:52] had
[35:53] and that's why he gave his life
[35:57] if you notice his very life was a life
[36:00] of sacrifice
[36:03] he didn't come uh
[36:06] high and mighty or for a certain
[36:09] sec a certain group
[36:14] but he came from those that are without
[36:20] he was the very expression of god
[36:25] and god is love
[36:29] the love of god conscrained him
[36:34] to did what he did not for himself
[36:39] but he did it for us
[36:42] everything that ever was done everything
[36:45] that was
[36:46] written you know he had a purpose in it
[36:51] he was expressing to us
[36:54] god love for humanity
[36:59] and that love he had for humanity
[37:03] that he wanted to express that
[37:06] uh how much that he went and
[37:10] how far he went to redeem us
[37:14] from the penalty of sin
[37:19] and i believe that here paul talking
[37:23] about
[37:24] having the same mind
[37:28] in romans 12 it also said that uh
[37:31] let your mind be transformed the
[37:36] renewing of your mind there's a
[37:38] a renewing of our mind that god wants to
[37:41] give us another mind setting
[37:47] here he flipping said that not don't
[37:49] think on your own self but
[37:52] think on others
[37:56] that's sometime is a a a place that
[38:01] we get stuck because seemingly we all
[38:04] hung up on ourselves
[38:08] we always talking about what i want
[38:11] what i need but have you ever consider
[38:15] somebody else
[38:18] what you want and what you trying to
[38:21] achieve and
[38:22] yet you know all that you have you
[38:25] fail to understand that there's somebody
[38:28] don't even have
[38:29] half of what you have
[38:36] but i know it takes the mind of god to
[38:39] be able to
[38:40] understand that our very life are to be
[38:43] aligned
[38:44] a life that we live for our neighbors
[38:48] who is your neighbor
[38:52] everywhere you go you meet people
[38:55] you see people you communicate with
[38:58] people sometimes we
[39:02] uh like to always um
[39:05] the mindsetting that most people have
[39:08] not saying we have here but
[39:09] it's just that we look on the good folks
[39:16] everybody that's already saved
[39:21] but how about that one that don't even
[39:22] know jesus christ
[39:26] how about that one that never even heard
[39:29] of a savior
[39:33] how about that one that don't even know
[39:35] that he can be
[39:36] rescued
[39:40] see that's when the mind of god becomes
[39:43] to be so
[39:44] evident but i know it's something that
[39:47] has to be in your heart
[39:50] it's something that come with when god
[39:53] when you really understand that
[39:56] love that he had even for you
[40:00] and we know what kind of shape we were
[40:03] in
[40:04] we know that if god didn't come and see
[40:07] about
[40:08] us where will we be tonight
[40:14] i look at myself sometime and i really
[40:18] you know it really gets to me
[40:21] you know because uh i know
[40:24] that if it wasn't for god mercy
[40:29] how would i ever be able you know to
[40:33] even
[40:33] hold my head up if it wasn't for the
[40:35] grace of god
[40:38] how would i be able to live with my own
[40:42] self
[40:42] knowing how wretched and undone i
[40:46] were then god
[40:49] came way down and picked me up
[40:53] somebody said he had to reach way down
[40:58] to get me out of the mess that i was in
[41:01] what did it it was his love
[41:08] and then we can really appreciate
[41:12] when you really understand i was telling
[41:14] my children a little study
[41:16] you know trying to just uh share the
[41:20] love and what it really meant
[41:25] and i was telling i said you know if you
[41:27] can ever obtain the love of god that is
[41:30] so
[41:30] rich in your heart then it can flow
[41:34] out of you
[41:37] and the son of god said that's what the
[41:39] world is looking for
[41:41] the love of god i mean the real love
[41:46] love that don't look at what you got
[41:50] love that look at no matter what you
[41:52] drive or where you live at
[41:54] or what clothes you wear
[41:57] but a love to let you know that you know
[42:00] there's hope
[42:04] even though you may be in a bad
[42:06] condition but god can deliver
[42:10] i know that you we get so low in ourself
[42:13] and things that happen especially now
[42:16] but yet still there is grace
[42:22] but having the mind-setting
[42:27] when you see those that are without
[42:30] what kind of mind setting do you have
[42:36] you know what i'm finding you know we
[42:38] all know this that
[42:40] some of the time some of the religious
[42:43] folks sometimes
[42:44] is some of the worst because the way
[42:46] they think about others
[42:49] as long as uh if they're not in
[42:52] our little inner circle
[42:56] if they're less than they're not in the
[42:58] message
[43:00] then we can't hardly relate to them but
[43:03] how they ever gonna come to it
[43:05] if you don't have the love of god in
[43:07] your heart
[43:10] see because i'm saying for god so loved
[43:13] the world he loved
[43:14] everybody
[43:17] even if you notice even judas
[43:22] jesus called him friend
[43:28] friend knowing he was a deceiver
[43:32] knowing he was the one that was going to
[43:33] betray him
[43:35] he treated him no different
[43:40] he was one of the disciples
[43:44] casting out devils and along with the
[43:47] rest of them and
[43:49] he didn't hate he didn't say oh i know
[43:51] you the devil get out of here
[43:56] even though he knew what he was going to
[43:57] do
[43:59] but yet you know he knew that
[44:03] the love of god you know was so
[44:06] great that he can love even his enemy
[44:11] i believe some places are written
[44:12] they're saying if you love them that
[44:14] love you
[44:14] what good is that don't the publican the
[44:18] same
[44:21] but how about loving those that don't
[44:23] care nothing
[44:24] for you loving the unlovable
[44:29] those that persecute you and ridicule
[44:31] you
[44:33] can you have a compassion for them
[44:37] you know even though you know because
[44:40] see
[44:40] when you are under the influence and the
[44:43] powers of satan
[44:45] you know you uh uh may not even be aware
[44:50] what really is going on with you
[44:54] now as many of us out of that condition
[44:56] we can look and see you wonder
[44:59] why did i even do such a thing
[45:02] because of the powers and the
[45:04] principalities of the air
[45:06] had our minds blinded
[45:09] but when god opened up your eyes of
[45:13] understanding you realize i don't have
[45:15] to live like that
[45:19] but what you heard about the gospel of
[45:23] jesus christ you heard how he made a way
[45:27] for you
[45:29] and you understood that if you continue
[45:31] the way you were going
[45:33] you were going to be destroyed
[45:36] and it's like this what could you lose
[45:40] you were already in a mess the world
[45:44] already you know man
[45:45] the our only way out is to accept
[45:49] what jesus did for us at calvary
[45:56] so when jesus was here you know if you
[45:58] notice
[45:59] he didn't went to the church folks
[46:03] when he did met him they called him a
[46:06] devil
[46:08] they ridiculed him for what he was doing
[46:11] don't he know what man of people he's
[46:13] dealing
[46:14] with they saw him eating with the
[46:16] sinners and
[46:18] things like that and they could
[46:19] understand if he's supposed to be a king
[46:22] why is he associating with those in
[46:24] other words
[46:25] low-life people
[46:28] but the bible said that you know he
[46:32] uh came to the common people
[46:36] and they heard him gladly
[46:40] they were glad that somebody took the
[46:44] time out to let them know that
[46:46] you know you can come out of this
[46:48] situation
[46:52] no doubt when jesus fame began to grow
[46:55] up on the earth
[46:56] and the religious folks saw that the
[46:59] people began to
[47:00] follow him it disturbed their church
[47:05] because he was a man that posed to be a
[47:08] king and a
[47:10] teacher a rabbi and here he is
[47:13] associating with you know those that
[47:16] were sick and demonic pressed and
[47:19] all kind of like that but that's what he
[47:22] came to do
[47:26] but it was a mindset he had the mind of
[47:29] god
[47:32] that's why we need the mind of god
[47:36] we need a very heart of god the love of
[47:39] god
[47:41] i i mean i'm i'm really talking about
[47:44] that love that uh constrains you to go
[47:48] the
[47:48] extra mile go beyond
[47:54] you know because we have little limits
[47:55] you know
[47:57] i'll go but so far but wait a minute
[48:01] but god went the whole he went beyond
[48:07] what we could even give him back
[48:11] but he gave it all
[48:15] god came left heaven
[48:21] to give us eternal life
[48:26] and to give us his spirit that
[48:29] we can have the same type
[48:33] mind that he had
[48:36] what mind is that the mind to do the
[48:39] will of the father
[48:42] to reach out to those that are without
[48:47] it's not our business worry about
[48:48] whether they're going to receive it or
[48:50] not
[48:50] you just pour out the love
[48:54] you never know what god will do
[48:58] you may not see it then but after a
[49:00] while
[49:01] i believe that if it's genuine that
[49:05] god love withdrawal
[49:09] don't don't have a measuring stick with
[49:11] your love
[49:14] but go all the way with them go to
[49:17] extra sometimes we have to go out our
[49:21] route
[49:23] it takes a wise man in one soul
[49:27] because the world has saw so much
[49:30] religious
[49:31] hypocrisy of a christianity
[49:34] debacle don't have no more hope
[49:39] because the church has failed
[49:43] why because they can't express the true
[49:46] love of god only through the holy ghost
[49:52] servant god said one of the evidence of
[49:54] the holy ghost
[49:55] is love
[49:58] when you can love in spite of
[50:03] yes you'll be mistreated yes you'll be
[50:06] hurt
[50:07] yes you'll be talked about but love
[50:10] anyhow love
[50:12] overrides
[50:15] if your love can't override faults
[50:19] and mistakes you see all of us got
[50:23] mistakes
[50:25] but with the love of god it overflow
[50:28] all that i look beyond your mistakes and
[50:32] i know you don't mean to do that
[50:35] you may get anointed by a little spirit
[50:37] you may say a little something but
[50:40] yeah i might feel a little better but
[50:42] i'll be all right
[50:44] i'm not going to hold no grudge against
[50:46] you
[50:47] i'm not going to cross the street when i
[50:49] see you i turn my back
[50:51] i'm going to say praise the lord sister
[50:55] and if i can lift you up if you're
[50:57] wounded i wanna say is there
[50:59] anything i could do to help
[51:02] i know i've went several times and tried
[51:04] to uh
[51:06] reach some people that have backslid and
[51:09] what are the man thing they've been
[51:10] saying this you know what
[51:12] they say not one person
[51:16] trying to even reach out
[51:20] you know because they don't know what
[51:21] the real cause see we don't know the
[51:23] cause
[51:24] what happens in people's life
[51:27] see things happen sometime that we don't
[51:30] have no idea we think oh there they go
[51:32] again just cutting up
[51:34] you remember that woman at the well
[51:37] how many of y'all want to sit with her
[51:39] and have fellowship with her
[51:42] had six husbands five and
[51:45] living with the sixth one she was the
[51:49] talk of the city
[51:51] did you think anybody really understood
[51:54] that she was a predestinated seed of god
[52:00] they looked at what she did and what she
[52:02] was doing
[52:04] served to god said she may had to make a
[52:07] living for her family or something
[52:10] yes it was wrong but see that's why i
[52:12] love about god
[52:14] he he looks beyond what we do and what
[52:16] we did
[52:18] and god looks deep and that's why
[52:21] jesus left take this up y'all go ahead
[52:24] in the city
[52:26] i got to go by samaria
[52:29] he told the preacher y'all go ahead on
[52:31] because they wouldn't understood what
[52:33] he's about to do
[52:35] the father led him samaria for one seed
[52:40] at this particular time at that day
[52:43] that woman that was a predestinated seed
[52:47] met jesus oh

[52:52] no sir
[52:53] did you know when you were going to meet
[52:56] god
[52:59] but god had a particular time
[53:02] he said i had need to go by
[53:05] samaria i had need to go by
[53:09] columbia or georgia or florida
[53:12] or aching or whatever i had me why
[53:15] because there was a seed of mine there
[53:19] yeah they heard about religion but i'm
[53:22] gonna do
[53:23] something that they'll know who i am
[53:28] this woman she heard about the things of
[53:30] god but when she
[53:31] met jesus in person oh that's what we
[53:35] need
[53:36] we need to meet god in person
[53:40] and when you meet him like that nothing
[53:42] can turn you
[53:43] around
[53:47] i'm glad i didn't meet god in church
[53:52] i met him in a club i say this he came
[53:56] to me huh did not god
