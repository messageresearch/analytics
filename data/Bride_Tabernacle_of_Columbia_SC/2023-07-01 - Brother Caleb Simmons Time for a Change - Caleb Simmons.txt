Deuteronomy chapter 2 and when you gotta say man and it reads starting at verse one and then we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and we can pass Mount Sinai many days and the Lord spake unto me saying you have compassed this mountain ye have can pass this mountain long enough turn ye northward amen God bless you we know this word you may be seated amen tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled time for a change it's time for a change amen I mean I was reading the scripture and I was it was talking about how Israel had come out of Egypt and they had they had come across and God had delivered them from the Egyptians and they had come through the Red Sea and they had seen the mighty miracles of god and they came to the place where they were in the wilderness and they have been circling for 40 years and they were going in circles and they were going in circles and then one day it beca it came to a point that it was time for a change it was time for them to stop going in circles and to turn northward it was time for them to go and accept all the promises that God had given them it was time for them to go get down and say you know what it's time for me to move forward it's time for me to take that's that next step in God let me go see what else he got for me he promised it to me and now it's time for my change it's time for me to change it's time for me to do what I need to do to get closer to God it's time for me to do what I need to do to get my promise is it's time for me to do what I need to do to get all the blessings that God promised me see it was time for a change and the children of Israel got to that point that they realized we got to do something different if we really want to see God move we gotta we gotta change some things if we really want to see God do what he said he was going to do we got to make some movements we got to turn northward it wasn't just something that God said it was there but there's some action had to take place some actions had to go forward they had to do something they couldn't just say oh God promised me this and and yes he promised it to you but what are you doing to get it he said I remember there was a story about a man who who went to heaven one time and he's seen this room I may have said it many times he passed a room that was halfway open and he seen all these gifts and the angel closed the door and he said what was in that room and it's long story short he got to it and then they opened the door and said that was all blessings that God wanted to give you while you was on Earth but you wasn't ready for it see there was some actions that he needed to take in order to get those blessings there was some actions that he needed to do in order to get those blessings but he had to change something he had to change some things I think about there was the Young Rich ruler and he was in he was doing some things and he was going and he finally had to come to his moment that he had to make a change he got to that pig pen and he realized I'm about to eat what the pigs eat but in my father's house there's food enough for the servants they're screwed enough for the animal there's good food for everybody in my father's house there's so many wonderful blessings in my father's house see he got to that moment that he said I got to make a change I can't keep going on this path because there's nothing there for me I'm already in the pigs pin where how much lower can I get how much lower can I get than where I am today see that that's where the that's where the that's where he was but he had to make a change he had to go back from whence he came he had to go back to his father he had to repent and say father I'm sorry see he had to want to do it you can't make a change if you don't want to do it God can't change you if you don't want to be changed her many said that you can go to God but if you don't want to be changed God can't change you he can do it but but he wants you to want to that's why he gave you a will that's why he gave you an opportunity that's why he gave you and told you that you get to make your own decisions because he wants you to choose him he wants you to come to him and say Lord I Want You Lord I want you for myself not because of what someone told me but what I want I want to make a change for myself so yeah the children of Israel had to make the individual decision to change they had to make it even though it was a collective group of people that changed and went northward but they had to make the individual choice to do it for themselves it could have been a whole group of people but it became it came down to what did you want to do in your heart what did you want to do and God asked you what do you want to do in your heart what choices do you want to make do you want to make a change many people you may say hey I'm trying to get them to do this but it's a it's a real thing one day when you come to the realization that they don't want to make the changes that you suggest they don't want to change the path today going because they think that when they get down to the end of that path it's a greatness a glamorous thing but see they might not know that you're giving them advice because you already done seen the end of the role you already done been down there and said there's nothing good down there so make the change now make the change while you can and you don't have to make the mistakes that others have made you don't have to go down those roads one day God came and he he changed some people some people came in front of him and I I said that sometimes you don't even see when the change is evident and I thought about the story of David there was a long time and you look in first Samuel chapter 16. and you notice that Samuel anointed David and David didn't become instantaneously a king he had he went back to the fields he went back to being a Shepherd before he became king see even though he was anointed king that change took a time to come it took a growth even though you may not be able to see it the change has already taken place even though you may be trying to pound it in the change is already taking place because when God changes a thing it may not happen instantaneously doesn't mean that the change hasn't happened I think of if you think of Science and you think of a butterfly it doesn't go from Caterpillar to flying there's a time period that happens it goes into that that worm stage and has to eat and then it goes into the Cocoon then it breaks out of its shell see many times things that maybe look like it's sitting still they in the Cocoon stage they sit and still don't mean that they won't change into the butterfly don't mean that they won't One Day Break Forth out of the thing that's holding them that cage that's holding them and they'll Fly Away you'll say when did that happen see God was doing the work see it was what they had in their heart it was what they got down and said Lord I want you to change me and no one else has to know that decision but you but you say Lord I want you to change me see see see that change was evident over time and see many people came to those moments where they want where God changed them and you're seeing how their life changed each and every one of us if you've been in Christ you know the story of how the Lord changed you how you came to those moments in those Crossroads where you had to make a decision whether you wanted to change or not whether you wanted to go down the path that was set before you or you wanted to do what the Lord called you to do and see there's there's many times when you come to your moment of change but how many people just let that moment pass by and I ask you are you letting that moment pass by all right have you come to that moment and God has called you and you said uh later but then you notice that later may not be promised to you later may not be promised to you and you always push it off and say later maybe tomorrow maybe this time maybe the next time but what if you never come to that time because you're always saying I got time I got time but we don't know when God is going to come and call us we don't know when tomorrow you wake up and folks that you thought was here are gone away and you realize that you missed it you realize that the ones that you was around you don't missed it because you said I got time you don't know when someone may go and push a button and a bomb drops and in the world as you know it is gone you don't know which time that you go to the bank and can't get money because they shut down the banks it can happen instantaneously because it's the moment of change but we saying that we got so much time we got so much time to live our life and I'm gonna get here and I'm gonna grow old you don't know that you don't know that so when you're a moment of opportunity of change comes take the opportunity seize that opportunity step forward and say this is my moment of change I'm getting the opportunity to make a change and I have to make it today she saw he was on the road to Damascus and a light shine from the heaven heaven and he said who out thou Lord and and God came to him that was his moment of change and even though Paul was not changed in that moment he still had to go through and was blinded until the till the man of God prayed for him and he opened his eyes so that he could see but that was his moment of change that was the moment that he got to the Lord called him to do what he got to do and later on he said that all these things that I've learned he was a scholar a scholar he said I counted as not I counted as nothing because that moment of change had changed everything for him it changed his whole outlook on life it changed everything even though he had all these maybe degrees and all these things that he had achieved in life and he realized that was nothing because he had that moment of change but God came down and showed himself to him as a real as as God and who he was and he had that moment of change and his life was changed forever his life will change forever you look at Peter and you say what what Peter he denied Christ three times and and see that God still gave him the keys to the kingdom he knew that he what Peter was going to change and he said after you have been converted strengthen your verb brother after you've been converted go strengthen your brother see there was some even though it was a it was an individual thing but it was an individuals that came together in that Upper Room and they wanted something to change and they said Jesus told him you stay there until you be endured with power because they wanted that change to happen they wanted to stay in there and they wanted to get on one Accord until something happened they wanted that moment of change in their lives they wanted they wanted God to come down so real to them that they knew that he was inside of them he was leading them he was guiding them said on the day of Pentecost 3 000 Souls were saved on one day every and when they spoke every man heard him in his language that's the power of God but it was a moment of change and you could have that moment each and every day in your life but but what are you going to change to get to that moment what are you going to change to get to that moment because whether you realize or not they made sacrifices they got to that upper room and they didn't leave that upper room until something happened they didn't leave there they said I'm going to stay here until I get my change I'm gonna stay here until something changes in my life I'm gonna stay here until God does the work that he promised me he would do he said if I if if I repented of my sins and be baptized that he would fill me with the Holy Ghost that's what he promised me and I'm gonna stay here until my change come and see they stayed there but how often do you leave before your change come how often do you get to the door and you don't go through the door because you stop there before your change come but it's a time for change it's a time that maybe you got to make some sacrifices to say Lord I need a change in my life Lord I need you to lead me and guide me and direct me and Lead Me Lord so I can get that change in my life Lord I want to walk in your power I want to hear your voice Lord I want to walk in with your Authority Lord I want you to lead and guide me Lord so that when I step in lord your presence is with me Lord I want people to feel you Lord not me not anything that I say or anything that I do but Lord I want them to feel you because that's what being a true Christian is about Lord you denying yourself and you're taking up your cross and you're following him so that people will testify that this is God this is God in the midst it's not you there and they know that that God is moving they know that God is real because they see him in you they know that God is real because a change has taken place in your life they may not ever read a Bible but they can look at your life and see the testimony they can look at your life and see how you live and say that's the one that knows God that's one that when they pray I know they can get an answer I know that when they go down on their knees the Lord hears them because a change has taken place they're no longer the same they're no longer going to the same places they no longer doing the same things because a change has taken place see it's time for a change it's time for things to change and God is moving and you have to get along go ahead and make these changes because you don't want to be left behind you don't want God to leave you behind you want to hear him say Well done my good and faithful servant you want to accomplish everything that he set out in your life to do the earlier you do that the better God the scripture says remember now thou Creator in the days of thy youth remember them now you don't get your the one thing that you never get back is time you never get your time back you never get your time back so as your time is the most precious thing that you have it's the most valuable thing that you have and sometimes you have to sit down and reevaluate how do I spend my time how do I spend my time could I be doing more for for the Lord could I be doing more with my life could I be evaluating myself and say where the opportunities the Lord I want you to use me more but even with the more you got to sacrifice more even with the more you got to be led more because you don't want to be doing the wrong doing God a service without it being his will you don't want to be doing things outside of God's will see it's time for a change and God is calling us to to get ready for this change I believe God wants to do great things and more than we can even see or imagine what God wants to do it but it takes a change it takes people getting together on one Accord and saying Lord do something in my life Lord do something in my life Lord I I don't know what you want to do but Lord Do It In My Life see all it takes is one that's all it takes is one person it only took one person to set a whole city on fire when that woman of the world when she had got her change when she met Jesus she went back and told everybody and the change that had taken place led a whole city on fire it only takes one see but it's time for your change [Applause] praise God it's time for a change amen thanks brother Kelly to come and greet us tonight in Jesus Christ's name we thank God for him coming to stop by and just holler at us and greet Us in his own way in Jesus name he glad for a change amen there's been a change in my life amen Jesus he's the one that changes us any other change won't last but if Jesus does it he knows how to do a good job amen God bless you God bless you Saints it's always an honor to come and be in the presence of the Lord you know I tell you I just he just made a way for you servant through that worship service is that right he was already here he just had to come and finish him off is that right because with the Lord if we're right with the service is that right the last song that is saying I'll fly away is that right rate and service nobody knew what he was going to preach but the holy spirit so we come and I'll fly away is that one day that's what we're looking for the change of the body is that right but we know when he gave us the Holy Ghost is that right when he gave us the holy ghost from the time we got the Holy Ghost until the time we change as he said what are we doing between that time now I'm not adding to take him away just anointing his head what is we doing between that time now right huh we gotta we gotta take away we got to do what it got to be a change is that right because the change we're getting ready to go to a war out there is that right and you are the bride not just the title but you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and now the change is here is that right time is soon we're about to wrap you in our body changes that he said I'll have you not what to be ignorant why of these things but he said what I shall what descend from heaven where it was for the voice with a child is that right we're going to cry and it's out here because it's come to do what change us is that right you don't have to yield you don't have to fall down to no devil no sickness no diseases sister when he sang that song How Great Is Our God how great is our God how Mighty Is Our God our god is awesome is that right we thank the lord we coming in just passing through by the grace of God and we said well I ease in here because I know how you past this writing like that grab a hold of me but I said let me just let him go in and get started you know brother Jeremiah and just sit there and enjoy it tonight becoming greeting you from spoken word Tabernacle then Gastonia North Carolina and for my pastor Stephen shimbo continue we just a young Fellowship in three years so we thank the Lord when we're able to come by and just Feast a little bit and you see the young soldiers raising up is that right keep them in prayer keep the ministry in prayer you know it's a great movement you got your meeting coming up next month seems like God always give me Grace to come by a little bit before you have your meeting and I enjoy it you know so we got some soldiers coming home is that right you're grown from a year when you're grown from a year now whatever you claim sacrifice that's what the holy spirit is saying claim if you need to lay in prayer don't move it's just like Jacob did is that right Jacob wrestled all night when he wrestled all night he knew that God was going to do a move for him is that right you can hold on to God uh who can hold on to God what holds on to God is your inner man is that right Paul was going through nature is that right he was Warren with the flesh but the inner man inside of him he said I Delight in the word of God in the Inner Man is that right God's brought us a word from the foundation of the world and we came before the foundation of the world he he was telling him is that right self-existing one we are there all by himself then when he came to that he left Genesis 1. he made Man created man in His image and his likeness then after he fell down again he jumped over the revelations to I mean res Genesis 2 is that right he formed that's what from the dust of the earth is that right in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with God the word became flesh then he dwelled down in US is that right well now what body spirit and soul see taste feels smell and hear consists of the flesh is that right then we come with the spirit man and now we're talking about the inner man that's talking brother Ernest he in the man feeds off one thing what is that the word of God down in the soul move back Satan God's bride is stepping out don't be afraid of anything be rejoicing praise God for the souls that's going to come during the 10 meeting during the Revival praise the Bell because you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you know when we go in there I go and Minister about three sometimes four times a week in the prisons in the jails God opened those doors back but you know when you're coming in when I go in there I'm specifically coming for one reason to get back God's children is that right is that right we are the bride he's given us the message of the hour and again so we don't have to fear anything any of your loved ones tell them to come out to the meetings get prayed up Believers you don't have to go through the prayer line let the Sinners come when we come let them come so they can get set free is that right I remember the time when you was with your wife brother he was there he wasn't your wife yet I'm coming up in the church up there Mullins is that right it kind of prayer line that day she had problems with her back I'm telling you about the supernatural God that we serve when moving into the what brother a change the change is coming you got to hear what the Holy Spirit was saying and when he got there in that line you know the little sparkles we have a Fourth of July and you get over there and they sparked like that Bros you was up there preaching in the anointing fell and it was all over it was all over God let me see in a different realm and not just rejoice in the shadow because I knew she was healed come on Satan speak it when you speak it rejoice it it's not you speaking it's the inner man that's speaking inside of you God bless you we love you praise God get ready well you're blessed get ready for the 10 meeting amen somebody says uh red Simmons we we kind of we're trying to you know fix a meal for you before the 10. before you start fast and I said we already started they were late I said we already started fasting for the meeting so by the grace of God I hope some of y'all already started have your hands started starting when you Holy Ghost tell you amen but we usually try to tell the church waiting after the fourth because some of y'all want to eat during the fall but after the fourth you know it's time to go into fasting and we wanted we want to label before God In Prayer brother Hammett said he's going to try to bring his church down and I think he said he got about 45 youth uh and so by the grace of God and they want to come amen so by the grace of God we want to look forward to God moving you could get under expectation amen for the Holy Ghost to move in a special way and I tell you the sacrifice you make in prayer and then fasting and seeking God when you come with expectation for God to move amen so we thank God tonight for the change has come amen for you have been changed amen and if you haven't been changed what are you waiting on if you're waiting what are you waiting on amen you can't get it unless you want it amen Jesus is not going to force himself on you he already did enough he died he shedded his blood he's not going to force himself amen whosoever will he said let him come you said well I'm too young for a change praise God but I want to change now amen God want to change your life and make it make you ready for rapture ready to go back to Glory when because you may not this world may not last another 10 or 15 years 20 years the bomb can fall anytime but are you ready it's better to be changed now because if you're not changed now you won't be changed then are you with me if you don't give your life to Jesus Christ I wonder how all those people going to heaven and they didn't want to worship God here but when they die they go automatic go to heaven see the Bible said as the tree falls so let it lie are you with me praise God you can't make a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit are you with me if you die in your sin don't expect to rise up in righteousness are you with me so a lot of people under expectation all of a sudden they just spent their time in the nightclub singing for the devil you know doing all kind of devilish stuff but when they die or that person was a good person and oh Lord Mata was nice personality but didn't live for the Lord didn't give their life to the Lord we need to give our hearts and our life to him and know Jesus Christ is the Lord and let him lead in God our life are you with me God bless you tonight I trusted you George brother Caleb and brother Kelly amen thank God for you
