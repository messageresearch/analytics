be instant in season and out of season praise the lord is that right praise the lord and and you know you you pray and and you seek god earnestly as a minister of the gospel what can i say praise the

you will if you need a title for your notes this present generation amen praise the lord this message i'm going to tell you it's going to be for young and old both praise the lord because you're going to find young people how important you are praise the lord and us old folks are going to find out how important we are in this kingdom amen praise the lord if you will then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not my might not my power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before the ruble thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring the headstone thereof with shouting crying grace grace unto it amen praise the lord then if you will please turn over to ephesians 2 and 6. amen and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus is that true church that wasn't loud enough is that true church that in the age to come he might show or shoe the exceedingly riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus amen is that right he's showing his grace is exceedingly riches of his grace in his kindness towards who oh my that was sick us come on us praise the lord i know you're getting tired you went through the anointing for two straight services but we got another one this morning and i let the devil have it are you praise the lord praise the lord let's pray father we thank you dear god for your mercy your grace god oh my god without your grace where would we be now lord this morning god let junior woosley step out of the way let them get a glimpse god of god the shekinah glory of god fill this place god every young person lord that doesn't hasn't ever repented god let them repent this morning lord every young person god that has not received the baptism of the holy ghost let it be this morning god every old person god that sees they need to move up closer to you god let it be this morning god for we give you the praise for it all in jesus name we thank you amen praise the lord you can be seated praise the lord i have here the last 10 generations how many realizes they named generations you know and praise the lord you know the last one i kept up with was the millennials does anybody recognize who's who's a millennial in here anybody recognize that they are a millennial praise the lord my daughter's a millennial my gracious boy this is good participation the first the last i just went back 10 of them one of them was called the lost generation i don't think i want to be there all right the last the next one was the inner bellum the brain generation i don't think i want that all right and the next one was the greatest and the greatest generation started world war one so i don't think i want that and the next one was the silent generation and the silent generation started world war ii so i don't think i went even either there the next one was the one unfortunately i was born in and it was called the baby boomer amen the next generation was x or baby bust the next one was zeaniel the next one was millennial the next one is generation x and now we are in generation alpha we have come back to the beginning there is something about that and this generation ends in two years in 1923 alpha will be no more they all have the next one up praise the lord did you just feel that anointing that just swept through there because everybody's starting to realize wait a minute we are in a generation that's calling their self the beginning and there's only one beginning is that right i am the alpha i am the omega is that right there's only one beginning praise the lord now hang with me today please saints now really remember he said here in ephesians that it was ages to come he would show his enriched grace towards us so it wasn't paul said it's not in the age i'm standing in that i will see that enrichment but it will be an age somewhere down the line to where i would the god's grace will be enriched so pure and so true is that right i'm here to tell you today i believe we've reached that age to where god's grace is greater than any any age before why because it's so much sin so much impurity in this world and we need god's grace and grace always rises to the need of the other of the time praise the lord a drunk needs a lot of grace amen some of you church-going kids don't need quite as much grace as a drunk does but a drunk needs grace and god supplies all the grace he ever needs is that right amen praise the lord praise the lord see grace becomes the power that we overcome with see satan throws things at us how many knows that praise the lord y'all quiet please help me preach please help me preach all right how many realizes that god's grace is not to and see we've got the definitions all messed up of grace when we use grace nowadays most people means compromise see see they want they they want to be able to do whatever they want to do and justify it i've got grace but that ain't grace because the power of god's grace comes in your life and he is a very help to you to overcome whatever god's put whatever the devil's put there amen praise the lord see grace is what gives us victory romans 6 15 for sin shall not have dominion over you is that right for we're not under the law but we're under grace grace gives us the victory come on say it grace gives victory amen praise the lord amen see he set forth a pattern and god always sets forth patterns you know and it's really nice because once you find his pattern once you step into god's pattern then then it just you know the next step you know the next step you know the next step because you're in god's pattern see see the devil he never forms the exact pattern over and over and over again praise the lord he's got all kinds of manipulable things that he me there my tongue is tired i got to get a drink all right so he manipulates to whatever he wants it to be is that right he can't create but he manipulates praise the lord and see with that manipulation he then starts blinding their eyes to what he's doing praise the lord and what look good is actually bad praise the lord so god's got a continuity a plan and this is where where i want you to follow me see god didn't mean to throw any surprises with us is that all right you know people say wait a minute god it sure was a surprise that god moved then where was your faith where was your faith at because if you're surprised you didn't believe to begin with because faith is the substance that i'm holding in my head and i refuse to let it go amen so we see we anybody surprised today of god moving then sorry you didn't believe but it won't surprise me when he moves because i believe he'll move amen praise the lord see so god always used two types of people and and all through history and i plan on proving this uh through the word he uses the old to lead all right and unfortunately you young young people here he always uses the young people to bring things to pass oh man i heard them on that you know well that's good i'm glad you um you can say amen too if you like praise the lord see because god god realizes that the young the older folks we are supposed to be leading the young people praise the lord that's what's supposed to happen is that right all through scripture you can see this manifested all right for example when joshua went to spy out the land is that right he didn't send a bunch of old fogies over there come on the bible says in joshua 6 23 and the young men that were spies praise the lord how many is a young man oh my gration come down there praise the lord i thought i was going to stay up here but i'm going to come down there let me find one of them fellas that didn't raise his hand let's start with that guy right there you liar you're a young man aren't you don't tell me you're 59 years old come on is that true no so why didn't you raise your hand you ashamed of it no you just couldn't get your hand up hey man that thing weighed 25 pounds oh [Music] don't get mad at me okay okay see god sat there and he he chose deliberately young men hey you think i could have climbed the wall you know but instead who did he choose he chose a young man and he said the young will go go spy out the land and come back and give us a report on how hard it's going to be to take it he depended upon the truthfulness of the young man that he said he trusted them praise the lord come on old folks where's our trust where's our trust man we're afraid to turn a young person loose a little bit but joshua wasn't afraid he said i'll send the young ones and don't be truthful and i can depend upon them to come back praise the lord is that right praise the lord and did they come back praise the lord is that right see see well why not joshua because joshua was a young man when moses sent him in but see he couldn't lead because he was a young man so god let him wander in the wilderness for 40 years getting some age getting some experience come on so he could lead and then god give him young man hallelujah so you see how this is building god's given him young men now praise the lord to do the work praise the lord see we've actually done the same thing in our household for years who takes out the trash dad says i ain't doing it mom says son daughter take out the trash come on saints we didn't realize we were were being like god when we did that did we i should have heard a bunch of amens from some parents out there somewhere sister kylie please say amen you know we didn't know we were doing what god did praise the lord amen now let's talk about joseph for a minute now would somebody please raise your hand anybody 17 years old raise your hand please anybody i got a 17 year old oh hallelujah anybody else yep two anybody else three anybody else four they're starting to get brave hallelujah ah gracious pulling you out of them tears to the altar god's gonna have to do it but let me tell you he's got a great big old claw hammer you might think you've got your tail end nailed to that chair but let me tell you he's got a big claw hammer and he'll pull it right out praise the lord amen praise the lord now see joshua according to what i read how old do you think joshua was when he was thrown into the pit hell i mean joseph thank you i am confused say joseph how old was joseph anybody yes sir how old you're right see praise the lord see me after church you get a prize brother all right see now listen he was hell 17 years old now if you were picking someone to preserve life how many of us would have picked a 17 year old come on be truthful but god knew he needed a young man he didn't need somebody that was old he didn't need somebody that was experienced he needed somebody that was tough and rough and could take it [Music] so he chose what a 17 year old throws him in the pit without any water is that right man i see i've done drunk i have a half a a thing already i want to dehydrate it down oh joseph's sitting there saying god shall deliver because why he's young and he's got the experience with god he don't have the experience in life but he has the one that does have the experience and that's god and he knows him see and he knows god you must have something major in store he gets pulled out sold into bondage is that right went into potiphar's house now how many 17 year old boys do you know would resist this huh potiphar sits there and comes goes out on on on on a business trip let's do it that way and here's potiphar's wife's looking at that 17 year old boy and you can't tell me girls you don't lost did you feel that yeah i know us fellas do it about twice as much as you do but you still lust and she lost it after that young man she might have even started to disrobe and say come here honey i'm gonna teach you some things huh but he sits there and says ain't no way ain't no way i don't give myself over to god and this is not lawful my god's greater than this you don't have to cave to those temptations let me tell you you don't need to end up in the back seat of the car or sneaking around the house when nobody's home praise the lord if you knew how many young ladies that i've seen weep through at this altars through life and then say brother junior will you come to my wedding and they walk down down all in that solid white wedding game and i know they're just as pure because they received the holy ghost when they was 10 years old when they were 12 years old when they were 13 16 17 years old and god preserved them [Applause] praise the lord i'm going to tell you some something fellas there's a light switch that you carry on the inside of you and once you start flip that switch on it ain't no cutting it off it ain't no cutting it off why brother jr because your body is made to do that praise the lord that's what the bible said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his and they shall be see just like us and god just like us and god praise the lord we can't have nobody else is that right and if you really have the experience you won't want nobody else praise the lord praise the lord see so so he could have done a lot of things but he said he's thrown into prison he says they're saying well and what what everything his hands god bless us but wait a minute god if you're blessed me why ain't i free that thought never quickened his mind hallelujah is that right never ever pass his mind he said because i'm in the will of god god's working it out i can't explain it i can't say really what's going on but i know this that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever is that right if he's a deliverer one time he has to deliver over and over and over and over and over again [Applause] praise the lord and see he took and he just waited deliverance come is that right praise the lord and finally he's exalted up right next to pharaoh you know and he's got all of this under control and he says oh where's that potiphara let me get a hold of him huh no vengeance and christians you adults that's supposed to be leading their young people you hold stuff in your heart for years and years and years and it raises anger and strife and you don't think these young people don't sense that when somebody's name is mentioned at the table and all of a sudden you go sour you don't think the young people know that and you are a leader hallelujah that 17 year old boy had more deliverance than a lot of us it got quiet praise the lord see his attitude see and what what what does the correct attitude bring every divine promise of god to pass yeah is that right thank you brother for the amen but i'd like to hear some from out there maybe come on every the your right attitude brings what every divine promise to pass thank you see be not grieved nor angry with yourself that you sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life oh my you young people identifying with this praise lord i hate to use the same stories over and over again that's been said with the way the lord moved on me so let's take it younger how many how many 13 year olds we got any 13 year olds we got one back there amen anymore 13 12 or 13. yeah we got another one we got some hey praise the lord their arms hey it's a miracle ain't it their weight's starting to leave hallelujah praise the lord my gracious here's this little girl 13 years old she's a young young one in the house and guess what mary yeah mama i need water yes mama sound familiar with any any any young people identify that yeah some of you is just not in your head thank god you know that you can identify with this you know because here's mary she was nothing but a 13 to 14 year old according to history but yet guess what she was getting ready to have a life-altering experience is that right she goes after the water and instead she meets an angel of the lord who starts saying nice things about her but you know what the problem with oh my the bible says she was troubled at his sins now does that sound like the bride today i have you know i'm the bride of jesus christ yeah that's right preacher you're preaching right about me and mary sat there and said well wait a minute you know i love the lord i love the lord you know but that's all i can really say i love the lord it's nothing special about me hello see she left plenty of room for god to reach down and lift her up she didn't have to lift herself up on what she confessed god did it for if we keep our mouth shut you would see what god would really do for us and say god i just love you that's all i know i love you i love you more than anything god praise the lord see mary said the angel said you're you're going to be endued from on high and you're going to you're going to have a baby in mary goes wait a minute how is this thing to be okay because now think about it think about it real close mary was living in prophetic times but there was no prophet the word always come not through angels but through prophets see she didn't have the revelation yet about angels being messengers is that right and so she's sitting there how can this thing be because there's not a prophet is god getting ready to send a prophet let me tell you something when solomon was dedicating the temple 12 generations approximately 480 years after moses he refers back to the prophet to moses and says because of what moses have said we rest on that that's 480 years roughly if you're considering a generation 40 years is that right the prophet of god has been dead how many years 59 years and we still can't seem to rest and you think your leaders what are you teaching your children you believe this thing one time and this thing the next time and and you can't find rest but my bible says jesus christ i'm sorry brother the same yesterday today and forever he don't ever change hallelujah see and so now she wanted an explanation how's this going to happen and for the first time the word of god didn't come through prophetic lips it came in spirit form is that right what we want you to get young people the holy ghost because the bible says and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee is that right and that child shall be called the son of god is this all right see now listen and mary's actions young people she's 13 years old the holy ghost overshadows her she might have spoken tongues i don't know i wasn't there to listen it doesn't matter if she did or didn't is that right but what does matter is something clicked and she believed god with all of her heart and the bible says in that day not six months later not three months later how many of you ladies know what i'm getting at she didn't feel that first kick come on she didn't know whether she was or not as far as the nature but all of a sudden she grabs up herself and starts running to elizabeth because she knew how by faith praise the lord and you see the old leader is that right elizabeth and the young mary coming together and now you see the old leader needed the young mary [Music] is that right do you get it young people the devil comes and says you can't do anything you're too young you too small you they don't trust you they think you're sneaking around behind their backs he gives you every reason not to believe god but that little 13 year old girl did it and took deliverance to the leader elizabeth oh mary why did the mother of my god come to see me today i said not because my child has not moved and with thy voice i it started kickin see the devil is trying everything he can praise the lord just just statistics you know we we thought we had passed enough law in the united states to finally get smoking to where it was just it was going out the door thank god you know and some devil invented a little thing about that long after some of them huh and it's twice as dangerous as cigarettes was all right you you won't know some statistics this is nine this is 2020 now not 2021 or 22 two years ago okay 30 of all 10th graders was vaping 37.5 in high school was vaping and what a lot of us parents didn't get stick our nose in a book and find out was that they don't have to stop with nicotine because it be it is in a liquid come on saints and so now what do they do they lace it with all kinds of stuff opiates fentanyl and your kid could be using in the next room and you'd never know hallelujah praise the lord one time a little he was either 11 or 12 years old come to me in camp and i probably told this before but i'll tell it again because he come to me in a prayer line and he said brother junior i am addicted to pornography i said how can a 11 or 12 year old child be addicted to pornography so i went home and stuck myself my nose in some books and found out yeah it's the worst age to be addicted because it takes the normal marital relationship completely out of their system hallelujah you boys sitting there watching that pornography and stuff you don't know what you're doing to your bodies because what god intended to be an act of intimacy between you and your wife is that right now has turned into entertainment come on and you don't look at her as a wife you look at her as an object of entertainment for you hallelujah it's quiet praise the lord but i'm preaching this generation praise the lord and so 20 of all of the high school seniors in 1920 went further than nicotine 20 of the 37.5 went on past nicotine praise the lord and i tried my best to find a sound percentage of how many children view pornography but they said over 65 percent both boys and girls included by the time they reached senior in high school has looked at pornography more than once i'm giving this to you leaders get nosy you're leading them get nosy praise the lord is that all right see my see god is calling this amen how many realizes so when god wants to hurt the church if you would look over this message in its entirety you know what what when that brother stood up last night and said he has a he goes to a church that's young that tells me one thing it's a working church all right because young people work that's what god's called work in the kingdom and vineyard of god you know a preacher told me the other day he said brother i was trying to find a young brother that would lead singing for these meetings and i couldn't find her i said are you kidding me god's called you young boys to work in the vineyard that's why he wants you and so he knows us leaders are going off the scene somebody got to pick up the torch and if you don't get the expedience the experience now while we're still here and so what does he do he attacks the young people just go back here's samuel come on saints dedicated to god is that right so satan said i can't touch him incidentally he was three years old he said six he had one six and i've had one five that's the youngest i've seen seen give their heart to god and it take it last that i know it lasted all right you know five years old his mama was a prostitute and was at a camp and would not let him come and pray oh but thank god he comes running up pulling my britches leg crying and i think he's hurt but oh my when i've been down i said what's wrong buddy where'd you get hurt at he said i'm not hurt i just wanted to meet jesus mama wouldn't let me come is it too late i said son it's never too late samuel was three dedicated to god is that right but eli had two sons and god said the reproach that i can bring through those two boys when two preachers boys gets gets in trouble oh wow you're right now listen closely first samuel 2 17 if you need to write it down wherefore the sin of the young man talking about eli's sons was very great before the lord four men or for eli's sons abhorred the offerings of the lord did anybody just ring home and this is i'm going to come down for a few minutes because this makes me almost want to weep and cry because i never looked at it this way before jesus christ we're not supposed to know anything but jesus christ and him crucified is that right right he is our sacrifice is that right every drop of blood that was shed for us was shed that day is that right there's nobody shedding any more blood come on saints and so as you as young people that sits there and says you know what brother i don't want any part of that sacrifice i'll decline that sacrifice matter of fact i hate what it does to me wow then how in the world can you look at god because you're abhorring god's own sacrifice young people do you see what the devil has done when we are needing you the most that we've ever needed you in our lives god has come and started making you reject what he's done for you on the cross i don't believe brother jr that all of my sins can be forgiven is that preaching is that the word god was angry at them not because they were stealing but because they wouldn't respect what he was doing through the sacrifice here we are we're needing young people and you're sitting stiff won't even reach your hands and we're saying god we need young people because soon we'll walk off the face of this earth and we will go on and meet our maker and somebody's got to carry the work until the rapture takes place we need them and they're setting rejecting what you've done for them on the cross oh my that's all right you can tighten up if you want to it's still the truth it's still the truth see because see god through that cross we received something we received an inheritance and to the emphasis when paul was preaching the gospel the cross meant one thing come on saints and then it comes down through time is that right and we hit luther and wesley and then we walk into this last age 1906 on azusa street the power of god did fall is that right and now it's time for us to pick up our inheritance because he's promised in a day that we could receive great grace is that right come on saints but instead we're busy saying i really don't need it i'm doing all right god understands two girls walked up to me oh my and like i said some of my stories i repeat because they they make sense i got a whole bunch of them but these are the ones that stick out to me that moved in my heart that made me cry and weep before god two girls walked up to me and said my mom and dad said that they would abide by your decision you know and i thought i didn't say it i kept my mouth shut thank god every once in a while i can't keep it shut but i thought i said why in the world are you asking you having your kids asking me you're the leader you're the one but see they were wanting to shove it off on somebody else come on don't you ever do that if you don't know the answer get down on your knees and pray until god gives you the answer and those young people will respect that and so here he comes we want to go see an r-rated movie and a lot of the other churches i mean a lot of the other kids at the church are going and we'd like to go to i said girls you're going to be extremely sorry that you come and ask me you have no business praise the lord that's the house of the devil see i've got an advantage over some of y'all my dad at the end of world war ii he was a light infant uh light artillery man he he operated a 30 caliber machine gun at the end of world war ii god saved him god blessed him to get through it and so at the end of world war ii what he became was a projectionist because all of the they would the united states had all kinds of films over to entertain the soldiers while while they were waiting for shipment coming back over so my dad became a projectionist all right and so he operated the movies you know and so he one day the movie projector goofed up and he started looking at the strip and right towards the end of the strip all of a sudden he started looking and there was this incredible cold i mean with with water running off the side of it glass a coke you know and so he he went a couple more little things there it is again then he goes again so he calls or writes somebody and says hey what's that doing on there he said oh that's suggestive selling you don't even see them come by your eyes come on saints you go into that thing and look at that movie you don't know what's passing by your eyes that your brain is registering and they told dad that the cells of drinks at intermission doubled when they put that on the end of tapes hallelujah are y'all getting tired man i ain't even halfway through notes are y'all getting tired young people are you getting tired say it well thank god i got one young people's i hope he ain't lying praise the lord see we are we are based ourself we've got this inheritance that is due us through the power of the cross okay but the problem is you got to come to the cross to get it and you know you can't start off shouting and dancing you know young people you're a sponge old people you're a sponge and whatever atmosphere you get in you will sup it up is that right so first of all you've got to break out of that atmosphere that you're in because you ain't in a clean atmosphere your mind ain't clean come on your heart ain't clean and you've got to break out of that and come to the foot of the cross where you will receive the cleansing is that right of the blood of jesus christ amen which gives you now the potential to redeem your inheritance but first before i go any further any everybody understands an inheritance right praise the lord man i keep looking in the paper you know they print inheritances that haven't been claimed and i just know one of these days there's going to be hassel woosley jr somebody left me a whole bunch of money see because all the time people receive inheritance and never know they received them and so a lot of us a lot of you young people has made that trip to this altar and you pleaded the blood but you didn't know that there was an inheritance that came with that yes sir because how many realizes the blood by itself is nice but without the power that is in the blood we don't have a lot because then it's just like a bull you know two total of us but see god sits there and he give us the power don't deny it receive it because let me tell you what's in store when you finally come to that place oh wait a minute there's an inheritance waiting for me i want it how many realizes he said i won't leave you comfortless i will send the comforter anybody ever look that up in the greek i know this is this is not normal youth message but i'm hoping i'm getting down every all all of them is getting a little bit the greek on that is not i'm so sorry because that's the way most people read it but it's intercessor it's someone that goes instead of you god's grace he says the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to block god's judgment anybody feel the presence of god the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to say hey god i he says i'll block the judgment for god because i'll place the blood in front of you you have formed a union how many understands i'm going to a quote right now god has formed a union jesus christ and foreign union with you and because of that union he won't kill himself he'll plead the blood for you enrich grace enrich grace [Applause] praise the lord y'all done quiet are you listening see because the promises to you and who we've got another promise and to our children you see this little book marker right here god dealt with me and i'll make a long story short finally it took god's speaking to me three or four times to finally get the direction of what to do with this i ordered two of them at a time from from the voice of god and i'm not a big voice of god order but but god god just quickened in my heart and i ordered to him and on mother's day this year the last thing we did before we dismissed i brought my wife down i've got two boys that's wayward but the promise is to me is that right and i said mom i didn't know what to get you for you for mother's day so i'm gonna give you your two boys all right my oldest son i haven't talked to in over 12 years three weeks later i'm at the church doing paperwork the phone rings and i look cooper at the caller id paul woosley and since then he's called he's texted i have a promise and i let the devil deny me [Applause] god give me this inheritance praise the lord see ephesians 1 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ both of which are in heaven and which are on earth in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the council of his own will god's desire to place his word inside of us is that right why brother brother jr didn't paul have word yeah he had word but the word wasn't fully restored is that right and it went all through the ages but in this last time god has given us grace see we couldn't control it without god's grace is that right and so what does he give us for an inheritance of people why can you look if this morning you won't deny that sacrifice and you accept him what can you look forward to praise the lord i'm just going through my notes i know it's going to sound choppy is that all right see because he's longing to bring you to this point i can you know a lot of people think god's just sitting somewhere i don't know how many of y'all still be able to see me or not but god's just sitting somewhere relaxed saying well i'll get excited about the rapture when that time comes i believe he's sitting on the edge of his seat i believe he's looking for the very second to appear when we're ready a prophet of god told me we were holding him back verla verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also young people more and more i'm going to come down here again and talk to you musicians you can come on back young people never before that scripture reads so true like i said i've preached to young people for 44 years it used to be i never had a young person come up to me and say brother junior i don't know what to do my mama and daddy don't live what the preacher preaches i don't know who to believe leaders where'd that come from and we're expecting and we don't understand where's their children at they get up to 16 17 18 years old walk out the door and hate going to church but he said young people this alpha age that we're living in the beginning that i'll give you power to do the works and see everybody says oh man i want the works i want to be able to lay hands on the sickness am i going to offend you okay i'm going to lay hands on the second they shall recover i'm doing the works of god you're only doing a part of the works because when jesus laid hands on that man he loved him [Applause] he looked as they were crucifying and driving the nails in his hands and said i love you i love you the works that i do yeah go ahead charlotte son i need somebody to see he feels [Music] he knows he's here [Music] the works that i do young people that's what he's calling you too all right not hypocritical not a halfway crit life halfway in half way out [Music] all the preachers coming over let us hide this [Music] see you're looking for something young people in this age and that's why so much has come open to you because you're looking [Music] do you think for one iota [Music] you know [Music] more and more i hang around young people one of the problems that we have when we put groups of young people together as pictures start circulating and i ain't talking about happy pictures and you gotta trail them down [Music] and you try to get somebody around this computer savvy enough to delete the file [Music] why is that happening brother jr because our young people are lucky [Music] and we're not supplying the god that they need to look to [Music] now if i've preached wrong you please forgive me but i've preached my heart [Music] we love the child and we love the dance but parents you don't get them to go out shouting and dancing i'm afraid it takes that long prayer life [Music] some of us would say i ain't prayed for my young people more than 10 minutes this week but yet you're expecting them to come through the door you're expecting them to walk up here and give their life to god [Music] but wait a minute little johnny you've got a ball game and it's church night just you're not going to be able to to attend church tonight and you just taught that child that that ball game is way more important than jesus christ we're shooting our own self in the feet we don't let we don't have to let the devil do it we do it ourselves [Music] so how many this morning young old [Music] come on little larry we're gonna need some singing i believe

when the tears start coming down i believe that when the tears start coming down something down touched down on the inside it went past the flesh and the spirit but something down reached the soul and i pray that this morning that we can take that what we've heard and what we received what we felt and built to build upon it amen you know i i like to reiterate something that brother woosley said this morning and he was talking about the older ministers going off the scene and i was just speaking to brother larry this morning i said you know i really love those older ministers i said that if the lord should terry you know they can't live forever but i says that we need them and i said if the lord terry one day you'll realize how much we needed those oldest ministers how much we needed those old men that you might have said was hard and rebuked and cried out against sin we'll realize that one day if the lord tarried i pray the lord come get us all at the same time amen but i thank
