to thank God for a visit to Yolanda Lloyd and all other visitors we thank God for you coming and being with us in Jesus Christ's name God is good amen trusted you blessed while you're here and come back and visit us some more amen thank God all week comes seems to do obvious just stirred because I'm looking I don't know sometimes you to reevaluate your spiritual walk and your life and then I think Caleb spoke on Friday concerning prayer and I was wondering what is it going to take for the church to be in power and been on fire for God and all I could think about is you got a Primo you know we used to have those all-night Prouds and praying for hours and all and it seems like if we have proud service just a few people can make it and uh I think sometimes we need to unite ourselves in prayer you know I think he said call for the praying women of the church and and I believe that we started getting more in prayer we'll see God move so my heart is is that the people of God be on fire for God and the lack of fire for God is caused the world to creep in and things to creep into our lives and in our homes because there's not the the prayer life that we should have it seems like it's lacking the devil got a way of making us so busy so busy that we don't have time to pray and when we got time to pray seem like we're exhausted and our strength is gone and the Bible said previous not ceasing we ought to pray always and he said well I pray all day I'll pray all day long I think sometimes you know we walk that way we are constantly meditating and on God and I thank me and my wife would get out walking and I can find myself singing and praying while we walk and um but it's nothing like kneeling down and really crying out to God nothing seems to take the place of that I don't want to prolong the time but I was hoping they got something ready okay go and say Can't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus king Nobody Do Me Like the Lord I gained nobody to be like Jesus he he's my friend oh yes King Nobody Do Me Like Jesus [Music] walking nobody [Music] heal my body told me to run on in my body yes he healed [Music] wolves have the king nobody [Music] oh you can't go oh it

special need just lift your hand and God remember those needs as I hit the ball hard to look into him father my hand is lifting my heart is open Lord we have needs this morning Lord and special requests Lord I pray God that you'll meet every request Lord God I pray that you look upon those on the prayer list Lord Lord God the brother Joshua mother Lord and family there and Lord God new very

we need your help Father I praise your blesses now as we oh god look into your word open it to to us make it real to us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen songs 42 probably God talked about thirst amen but we're going to talk about the Living God because of times in our Journeys we're wondering if our God is alive a Christian walk is that is your god alive says as the heart painteth out to the water Brook so painted my soul after the O God my soul thirsts for God for the Living God When shall I come in appear before him God blessed to read this word you may be seated the Living God Amen it's all right to come to church amen but it's a different thing that come into the presence of God you know I thought about when I was out praying this morning I said uh I said I I'm almost we used to have a a title Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever I think they still got it hanging up in Mullins and then the prophet of God put up be still know that I'm God and then I thought about when I was in Progressive and they would always uh I was glad when he said unto me we would quote that let us go in the house of the Lord and I thought about I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and I said that seems so real I was happy you know sometimes when we enter the house of the Lord he said come before his presence with Thanksgiving in his courts with what I I mean it tells you what to do and if we don't do it then we are not obeying what the word say isn't that right so but but it is common that we come and we're not uh uh uh doing what he said do we come and we sat back and we locked in on the movie theater something you know what I'm saying but when you come to the house of the Lord amen you don't set back you into you know it's just like you go to a a football game and and you said in the wrong section and all of a sudden the game uh the basketball game going and they need you know they need you to begin root dude for the team to create an atmosphere to intimidate the other people isn't that right but the devil is not intimidated the devil said oh I got y'all I got y'all look at y'all I got you and the devil said go and preach preach I guide these people to say Amen preach say what you want I I damn no I damn Say Amen I'm scared if I say Amen I'm scared to say Thank you Lord the devil have people intimidated he said now all the Demons of Hell sitting around telling God look at them look at them do they look like they're happy look at them they won't praise you you see y'all don't think the devil will be doing that stuff but what Jehovah tell you when the sons of God came together Satan came also and he said I'll tell you what to do if you move the Hedge I'll make your own Crush you to your face isn't that right so the devil amen he's still doing the same type of stuff he wants you to come to church and he wants you to be sad and miserable and nobody want what you got nobody want to serve the god that you serve because why when the folks out there in the nightclub they jump in and they're dancing and they look like they're happy somebody want that kind of God and people at the football game they going crazy and you said I I said we serve a living God isn't that right you sat back and I like nobody got to make you serve God nobody got to make you worship God nobody gotta you know work you up and tell you this what you ought to do I know you know when you come to in the Church of the Living God you have to create an atlas field for the word that's why we got to get come in early and begin to pray and cry the God God may you Amen to your anointing and your presence be there God Amen if anything that's blocking me amen from getting amen that's spiritual appetite feel and the needs that I need in my life father I ask you Amen to consecrate my life I want to be here early I want to be able to get all this you know all the stuff that amen that that is bothered me out the way and I want to pray and I want the word to come and I wanted to have power in it praise God I want to have power Amen in the word now there's no use in the preacher coming you know here at seven o'clock in the morning and crying out to God and the people come in I said Lord what's going on is the Lord hearing your prize amen I'm not getting on y'all this morning but I I'm interested in the power of God returning to the church I'm interested in the people being on fire for God I'm interested in that and if they're not on fire for God Amen then I believe amen that we need to re-examine our walk with God praise God I need a you know that's the Lord praise God I got if I got to take to the street corner again like I used to amen Lord I want to be on fire for you if I'm the only one standing on the corner by myself Lord let me take a hold of this gospel amen because I'm encouraged I mean we serve a living God amen but as a heart painted after the water so my soul touched it was a living God amen I want a God that's a lie praise God hallelujah amen praise God of that God is the god alive is he real to you you know I I I I I I I I heard they sing the song Freedom and I thought I'd use them for my subtop freedom praise God are you free are you free praise God because if you're free amen and they're saying freedom and all the young people be up jumping jumping oh I can't sing you know but they're jumping up and now and they said freedom you know because amen and somehow the the they might just be doing it because it's it's a young people thing and the music is right and all of that and they jumping up freedom freedom whether they are free or not I don't know amen but they act like they got something are you up man but people is not free amen I ain't free oh I'm not free you know you see me trying to uh tell you I'm free and I ain't free there's no reason why you can't be free there's no reason why you can't be free you said what are you talking about I don't understand the lingo I I don't understand what you're saying free am I free I don't understand that see a lot of times you take for granted that people understand what it means to be free but they don't understand what you're saying when you say are you free brother are you free sister the Bible says the way the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen you ought to be free if the spirit of the Lord is there it ought to be a liberty about you glory praise God amen but when you're not free Satan has you bound and I I thought about the children of Israel when they were in in captivity in Egypt and they were in bondage and on the slave master and the Pharaoh amen which is the devil had them in bondage amen for 400 years they were saved and in bondage but God had made a promise to him after 400 years I'm going to deliver you praise God well I can see God said and Moses down there and he said I want you to tell pharaoh to let my people go oh he was bad and I'm telling the devil to let my people go are you up there Hallelujah but you got it man you gotta know that amen The God That Sent you God in you amen you're not going alone amen God is with us look at that but if you don't see no change oh Lord hallelujah praise God I I tell you what I already had my confrontation with the devil this morning amen I already prayed through are you with me and God said if the Ministers of the Gospel don't have the power in them praise God and if you're a Christian and you ain't got no power something's wrong praise God what good is a church with no power what good is a Christian that don't have nothing praise God it's all right to speak in tongue it's all right to say what I used to have and what amen well how it used to be well what about now I say God is not dead we're serving a living God oh you want man I said this is the Living God God that is oh Lord tired of the devil beating up full it's God taking advantage of people amen God I'm all depressed amen God I'm strung out on drugs got him Pine up amen and all kind of wicked Watcher and you sit back and I act like you got to take it I don't have to take it don't go I don't have to take it I believe remember there's still power in the name of Jesus I still believe in casting our devils Hallelujah what did I can't cast The Devil out of you love the devil praise God Hallelujah we will sometimes don't want to be free are you with me you are hey pray for my child your child don't want to be free you need to pray that your God give them a desire to be free amen praise God pray to God change their mind about the demon that they're in love with amen that demon that you're in love with I don't care what the name of it it might be the name fornication it might be an adulterous demon it might oh Lord it might be an alcoholic demon if you were in love with that demon I can't cash it out until you're ready it meant to fall out of love with it praise God but I believe God is still casting out devils are you up man but if you don't if you love that devil how you gonna be free from it amen the children they wanted to go back to Egypt they want to eat you look like they they wanted Amen to devil and let us go back to Asia uh you know uh you brought us out here in the wilderness to die and some people amen they want I mean they don't want to let go next thing you know they was building a golden calf they've come out of either and then build a golden cow talking about these will be all gods they kubota's out of Egypt are you a man people so they forget that God that delivered them from all that sin and all that filth that we used to do God delivered us from that oh yeah can you see people going back to what God brought you out the Bible says in Ephesians 2 and you has it quickened who were dead I said we were dead I said we serve a living gardener you were dead and trespassed and in sin Romans 6 said he that is dead is free Pharmacy amen sin should not have any more dominion over you it does not have an authority and a power over you anymore because you died you were buried with him and baptism in the death that you can rise in the likeness of his resurrection are you up man Jesus Christ has set you free praise God but if you're not free it's only because he makes your mind has not been transformed Glory took off amen praise God he said I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercy of God that you present your bodies of what a Living Sacrifice holy I said holy you don't want to be holy God can't do it for you if you don't want him he'll never do it for you you got to want to be holy oh my God I want to be holding holy all the people that oh man Holiness was done no man gonna see the Lord are you up there amen people I don't know we seem to be laid back scrubbing and relaxed and don't want to be holy amen Hallelujah they make the world get in the whole God called you out of the world he said come you come out from among them and be your separate said the Lord and I'll be a father for you amen is it having these promises deal to be loved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and the spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God the Bible said it's a fearful thing to fall in the hand of the Living God are you a fan God is alive God is righteous peace God is righteousness God is good Hallelujah I shall have a good God praise God Garden oh Hallelujah there's no God like our God there's no God like Jehovah amen that's not enough brother sister ain't what a friend we have in Jesus there's no other friend like him amen that's not a friend like the lonely Jesus no not one praise God you don't have to worry brother sister friend amen if Jesus Christ amen can't do it it can't be if he doesn't do it for you it can't be done amen amen and it's not anything you know I I was I was just yesterday Lord you know it's not anything too hard for you to do I said not anything too hard and it just stuck in my spirit and I I just started meditating no it is not anything too hard there's nothing too hard for God I'm gonna tell you something brother sister it's time to stop playing around Run game with your soul and you want to be the Living God as a deliverer if you want to be free God will set you free [Applause] telling me you got an excuse me I can't stop doing this I can't live right praise God if you want to do it amen God will give you the strength and the power to do it amen that's it you know you're playing games trying to play like all of God is a weak God that all of God can't do what he's saying amen making God look like amen he weak so so many people claiming that they're Christian making God look pitiful amen that God can help that's why people serve the devil that's why young people don't want him because they're older folks say if they're not God why come they ain't happy I don't see no Joy about her I don't see him praise in God how come they're not happy I don't want mama God I don't want Daddy God I want a God that's going to make me happy I want a God that's a I can enjoy amen I want a God that's living praise God except you amen being an ambassador for Christ amen you got to be a living epistle your life got to be an example of a God that's alive Hallelujah oh yes amen somebody said I could join when I think about what he done for me praise God I know what he's done for me praise God I know why I would have been in a could have been but God man said are you up man it's the match of God that I'm here this morning and because God loved me enough they need to give his life for me [Applause] praise God I don't mind giving him back this old filter garment amen amen because he gave me a roll of pure white amen amen I'm not amen praise God I'm going to shame of the thing that's the way I used to live the things that I used to be involved in I'm ashamed of that and I don't even want to speak of it are you up man but thank God for bringing me out praise God oh yes praise God Hallelujah 50 something years and I'm so glad God delivered me are you up man praise God hallelujah but it looked like it's something that uh folks the Bible said he was despised amen and rejection of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with greed and if we hear that where our face is from him Lord wait a minute does he look that bad to you is he that boring to you it's God did he do anything to you wrong the Bible said all good and perfect gifts come from come from above isn't that right God is so good to us but yet and all the goodness of God and all that love of God and all that he does for us yet we don't want to serve him are you you know I thought about we serve a living God and he set us free he set the children of Israel were free from slavery from bondage the servant they were serving the Egyptian gods in other words but they stuck and the hell to God's unchanging hands some of them at least two of them Joshua and Caleb isn't that right out of two million two people held on Moses died and there's only two that came out of Egypt when in the Promised Land amen it was one in a million isn't that right about two million people came out and two went over are you with me so brother and sister you got to make up in your mind wasn't you're going to be with the Lord despise few or you want that straight and narrow way or you want that crowded way well that lead it to destruction you got to make them in your mind which way do I want to go what what I have a choice and a decision to make amen do I believe this God is a living God do I believe that he's real do I believe that he's faithful do I believe that he'll bless me more than I'm able to receive the blessings amen the exceedingly abundantly I'll bless you amen I'll pull you our blessings that you won't have a room enough to receive I'll give you a Hallelujah oh yes well if he can give them a natural land that flows to a Nook and how did how much can he give us a spiritual inheritance a Heavenly praise amen in Christ Jesus amen joy and speakable and full of Glory can he damn it to you praise God but somebody got to believe it somebody said I heard an old old story of Jesus in his glory amen I heard it amen but is it can I talk to you I look like I'm a hollering at you screaming at you but can I talk to you are you all right this morning you feel pretty good do you feel like God loves you amen if you feel like God loves you do you love him you sure do you love him somebody's devil said you better not say that you better not open your mouth and say you love him because you know you don't love him because if you love him you're what keep his commandment so I said well I I better be careful how many believe God love you don't raise your hand get the light puts you on the spot you believe God love you you believe he good you believe he'll give you eternal life if you ask you want eternal life are you with me can I have it eternal life amen what if tomorrow God call your number and you have to leave this world do you know where you're going are you certain of your destiny so much you know the question is like are you certain or where you want to go if God would call you home today are you certain of where you're going to go what is it I'm not reading your mind but here we are absolutely what is that what do you saying to God God if you call me home today am I ready to go the heaven do I want to go to heaven y'all know how we do it you don't want to be saved got free tickets to the ball game Carolina Clemson I got a thousand dollars that I'm giving away this morning who wanted y'all might stop P coming up here to get it people jumping running because they see something that's tangible but the Bible said he didn't come into God must first of all what believe that he is and he's a what amen are you uh do you believe God can give you what he's saying can he deliver on his promises amen can God back up what he said can he give you what he said can he do what he said he'd do amen I'm saying we serve a living God a god that is able to deliver he's able to deliver amen you glory to God Amen to the utmost Jesus said amen he says to the utmost it seems though you know I'm tired of I'm tired of just coming and going and people not really convicted their minds are not made up they don't know where they're going they don't know what they want but I don't want you to leave here uncertain your mind not made up you don't know what you want it's just coming to church because you're going through the motion you know that get a little boring the little tiresome people serving God today serving going to the nightclub tomorrow getting a drink smoking a joint lying and stealing them all coming to church oh he was a man God can you help me I said God can you help me is he a living God can he help you God can you help me how can God help you when your mind ain't made up how can God do anything for you when the Bible said a double mind of man is unstable in all his ways are you with me your mind ain't made up well Mama also always say you got to have a made-up mind you got to have a made-up mind you got to make up in your mind what you want you know sometimes a fella can have this young lady in that one you got to make up your mind but a young lady that's really serious you don't make up your mind and then you've got to put some solid commitment here are you with me if you really won't love me you got to commit yourself and let's go now into the courthouse you can't go to courthouse let's go to the notary and let's get a stamp on this thing because I'm on I'm a nail this thing down if you really want it then you got to separate yourself from that other one are you a man if you really want God then you got to make up your mind devil I know you're the devil and I know you don't need me no good you're no good and you I know you ain't no good amen but yet I put up with your other side I'm willing to go with the one that I know love me ain't gonna treat me right

about 30 years old and he came he said he said pastor I really want to come to your church I really want to be a part of it and then somebody came in and he saw that person following him and he said make him leave me alone he can come to church just like you you see what I'm saying you got to stand up for yourself when it comes down to the devil make the devil leave me alone you've got to make

the spirit and going back and doing the same old stuff but God won't put up with that serve the Living God Samson you know I thought about the church in this condition probably God spoke a message Church in this condition I thought about the church in this condition I thought about even the message believed was in their condition I thought about the church and the condition that is in it's got a it's just what you it's just what God called people out oh denominational systems and calling them out of mystery battle them and calling them into the word is just what he called out huh I know he looked down y'all y'all are y'all happy people are y'all really happy I don't see y'all shouting and dancing and happy Lord have mercy I couldn't even dance but you know we went to little parties and I'm they're kicking my leg and they thought it was a new dance because you know you ain't gonna just go in there and be looking around and you got to go in there you got to move and so people start getting around me and they stop moving like me I ain't got no record and they moved you know I got people following me and I don't know what the world I'm doing you know what I'm saying and that's what happens but one thing about it you're gonna make yourself be happy if you're out there serving the devil you may not be happy but you're gonna fool you know see what I'm saying but people come to church you ought to be free they're free to tell God I love you when I start thinking about what how good God is to me praise God all I have to do is go outside just look around a secret condition of the word the condition of of folk that oh Lord there's too many of my friends dead now oh you would be and the ones ain't dead they might as well be dead sometime the way they're living are you with me but it's a few trying to hold on to God's Unchained today and you see those they're trying to hold on to God's unchanging hand and you can see the difference in their life they even look you know they looked at 15 20 years younger are you a man the others look beat up run now on all you see what I'm saying I gotta close God is good y'all love it Samson did not know the Lord was had departed from him and I believe the church in its condition don't know that the power of God has gone away from them I believe people are actually saying I'm a Christian and they don't have no power are you one of them Samson had to shake himself he said once his locks had growled out because he had once he gave God his power but he gave Delight of his heart delighted cut his hair and cutting the hair was the Nazarite vile he wasn't supposed to never drink wine or cut his hair because if he cut his hair drank some wine then his strength would leave him and that's the way it is today the sisters are not supposed to cut their hair because their hands given them for a covering and long hairs for Glory so they're not supposed to cut their hair when they cut their hair they showed us that they're not under the headship of their husband their head are you with me are y'all with me so Thompson cut his hair God had his haircut the lighter put him to sleep and she found out his secret and she called in the Philistines to cut his hair are you with me and then she walk Samson up and Samson woke up thought he was just as strong so the Philistines upon you and he shook himself y'all gonna find yourself shaking yourself and finding the devil is upon you and you ain't got no strength to resist the devil why because Samson he kept fooling around with the world and kept flirting with the World to shoot till he lost his anointed he lost his strength see what I'm saying and that's what happened a church without power would get their eyes plucked down when Samson eyes was plucked out he couldn't see where he was going are you with me a church with their eyes plucked out no strength the devil is laughing at him the Philistines were laughing they made Sports of Samson they brought him out just for the show that Samson that we used to have to run from and hide from and defeated the the devil ain't got no power now a church with no power is being laughed and it's gone by the devil are you with me the devil laughed at you you ain't got no strength you ain't got no power you ain't got nothing so they made Sports acceptance but while they was making Sports of Samson Samson had grow back when it's after how they grow back and they would had this big meeting exception called a little lad and let them lead him to the pillow and Samson began to pray and said Lord just once more just one more time Lord you see how they're doing me you see what the devil is doing to my life you see how they picking at me how they mocking I'm gonna tell you the devil is picking at you he's marking you he's laughing at you and you think they love me they don't love you they'll mocking you pick it at you laughing at you because you ain't got no strength no more the devil laughing picking makes me feel sad for the people make me look down and say what you're preaching a gospel of power you're preaching a Holy Ghost Gospel a word that delivers people you're preaching an end time word and people ought to be more delivered have more victory in their life than any other people on the face of the Earth are you with me but people ain't happy people still have their head down did the world cut your hair the Philistines cut your hair took your strength away can you shake yourself I said Lord let me get my get my locks back out I believe God can do it it can cause your hair to grow back I'm talking about right now I don't you don't have to wait next week God can do it for you right now he can give you a strip back to you right now but you got to want it Samson went down in business because he knew that his strength was gone he knew that the Philistines had bought him in the plucked his eyes out and all of that but he wanted one more time to avenge I believe that that's what we need one more time for God to show his power in his church again in his people again I'm gonna show my power imma show this world I'm gonna show Colombia I'm gonna show amen the world that we serve a living God that God is alive that he's not dead God bless you let us stand God is alive I'm gonna tell you something brother and sister I'm talking to you but it's up to you to make up your
