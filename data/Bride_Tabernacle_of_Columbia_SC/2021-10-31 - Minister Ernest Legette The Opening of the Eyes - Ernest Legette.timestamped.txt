[34:16] morning
[34:17] amen i thank god for the songs and
[34:21] his grace giving us to we can be back in
[34:24] his house one more time amen
[34:27] you know things are happening so fast
[34:29] and
[34:30] i was telling uh somebody uh
[34:34] i think it was the pastor i was talking
[34:36] with him friday night i was saying you
[34:38] know
[34:38] life is so short
[34:40] isn't it
[34:42] i was thinking about my cousin that
[34:44] passed away right before we come to
[34:46] church friday night i said man life is
[34:49] so short
[34:50] you know she was the one that did our
[34:53] decorations at the wedding
[34:55] and i didn't even know she had fallen
[34:57] sick about a week or two ago
[35:00] but
[35:00] they called and everybody in the
[35:02] families heard
[35:03] said she passed away
[35:05] so i i said man that hit me so hard
[35:08] i said man life is so short
[35:11] i says you know
[35:13] i started thinking to myself for that
[35:14] little song i'm living this life so i
[35:16] can live again
[35:18] because if we put everything in this
[35:19] life
[35:20] come on it's so short
[35:22] it's full of sorrows
[35:24] a man that's born of a woman is what a
[35:26] few days come on
[35:28] and ain't that saying to be the truth
[35:31] a few days and what full of trouble
[35:34] but nevertheless he said i go away to
[35:36] prepare a place for you
[35:38] that where i am you may be also
[35:41] so i don't know about you i was just
[35:42] thinking on that way
[35:44] listen to hearing that about my cousin i
[35:46] said you know i i don't i'm not living
[35:49] this life to be here like that come on i
[35:52] said i thank god for his grace
[35:55] you know
[35:56] it's so many people that wanted to be in
[35:58] church this morning but couldn't make it
[36:01] whether whether they've been bound by
[36:03] something or whatever it might have been
[36:04] there's so many people that wanted to be
[36:06] here
[36:07] but couldn't make it
[36:08] so many people that want to worship god
[36:10] but they can't come on
[36:12] so
[36:13] just considering how short life is
[36:16] and and considering the grace that god
[36:18] has given us
[36:20] come on to be able to praise him one
[36:22] more time
[36:23] come on
[36:24] i say what we do we take full advantage
[36:27] of that opportunity
[36:28] we ain't gonna let it cease from our
[36:30] mouth to say thank you lord
[36:32] for all of your blessings toward us
[36:35] thank you lord for all of your grace and
[36:37] your mercy
[36:38] thank you lord for life health and
[36:40] strength
[36:41] thank you lord for blessing my family
[36:43] god blessing everybody around me lord
[36:46] thank you lord i ain't gonna let that
[36:48] cease from out of my mouth lord i thank
[36:50] you for one more time lord they sing
[36:53] that song one more time
[36:55] come on
[36:56] you didn't come here on your own but he
[36:57] allowed you
[36:59] come on he allowed us to come together
[37:03] somebody said i just came no he allowed
[37:05] you to come
[37:07] come on
[37:08] he allowed us to come together one more
[37:10] time
[37:12] i was telling uh
[37:13] a stinking brother charles the other
[37:15] night i was telling him i was saying you
[37:16] know
[37:17] sometimes people
[37:19] say where they could have been
[37:21] but i always say where i should have
[37:22] been
[37:24] because of the life that i lived
[37:26] and because of the things that where god
[37:28] has brought me from i don't i don't say
[37:31] where i could have been i say where i
[37:32] should have been
[37:34] but the blood of jesus hallelujah and
[37:37] what he did for me on calvary washed
[37:39] away all of my sins
[37:41] hallelujah
[37:43] all things have become new
[37:45] so where i know where i should have been
[37:48] if it wasn't i like that song for the
[37:50] mercy of the good lord hallelujah
[37:53] [Music]
[37:56] i said god is a good god

[38:01] the mercy of what the good lord i
[38:04] wouldn't be here today come on i know i

[41:22] score furlongs
[41:24] and they talked together
[41:26] of all these things which had happened
[41:29] and it came to pass that while they
[41:31] commune together and reason jesus
[41:33] himself drew near and went with them
[41:36] but their eyes were holding
[41:38] that they should not know him and he
[41:41] said unto them what manner of
[41:42] communication are these
[41:44] that
[41:45] ye have one to another as ye walk and
[41:48] are sad and one of them whose name is
[41:50] cleopas answers saying unto him are thou
[41:52] only a stranger in jerusalem and has not
[41:55] known the things which are come to pass
[41:57] there in these days and he said unto
[41:59] them what things
[42:01] and they said unto him concerning jesus
[42:03] of nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[42:06] indeed and word before god and all the
[42:09] and all the people and how the chief
[42:11] priests and our rulers delivered him
[42:14] unto death and have crucified him but we
[42:18] have trusted that it had been he which
[42:22] should have redeemed israel and beside
[42:24] all this today is the third day since
[42:26] these things were done
[42:29] yay
[42:31] and certain women also of our company
[42:33] made us astonish which were early at the
[42:35] south unite and when they found nada's
[42:37] body they came saying that
[42:40] that they had also seen a vision of
[42:42] angels which said he was alive and
[42:45] certain of them which were with us went
[42:47] to the subculture and found it even so
[42:49] as the woman had said
[42:51] but him they saw not
[42:53] then said
[42:54] then he said unto them old fools and
[42:57] slow of heart to believe all that the
[42:59] prophets have spoken ought not christ
[43:01] have to suffer these things and to enter
[43:04] into his glory and beginning at moses
[43:06] and all the prophets he expounded unto
[43:08] them all in the scriptures the things
[43:10] concerning himself and they drew now
[43:12] into the village wherewith they went and
[43:14] he made as though he would have gone
[43:16] further but they constrained him saying
[43:20] abide with us for it is toward evening
[43:23] and the day is far spent and he went in
[43:26] to terror with them and it came and it
[43:28] came to pass as he sat at meat with them
[43:30] he take bread and blessed it and break
[43:32] it and gave it to them
[43:34] gave to them and their eyes were open
[43:37] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[43:39] their sight and they said one to another
[43:42] did not our heart burn within us
[43:45] while he talked with us by the way and
[43:47] while he opened
[43:49] to up to us the scriptures may god bless
[43:52] to the reading of his word you may be
[43:54] seated
[43:56] this morning just for a moment i want to
[43:58] minister to you on a topic and i
[44:00] entitled it the opening of the eyes amen
[44:04] the opening of the eyes
[44:06] now we're seeing here a very familiar
[44:09] scripture
[44:10] of you know what is taking place but
[44:12] you know a lot of things in that day had
[44:14] taken place but
[44:16] the the the disciples are here
[44:18] walking the road to emmaus to the two
[44:21] that walk in the road to emmaus they
[44:23] were they weren't able to
[44:24] to uh comprehend what had just taken
[44:27] place come on
[44:28] so that's what we said the opening of
[44:30] the eyes a lot of times we could see
[44:32] things
[44:34] but we didn't comprehend what we just
[44:35] saw
[44:37] and so
[44:38] and that's what the the the issue was
[44:41] not only with the church world of that
[44:42] day but the issue is is the same with
[44:44] the church world today we can look back
[44:47] as the prophet god talked about we can
[44:49] look back and see
[44:50] what god has done or what god is going
[44:52] to do but we can always miss what he's
[44:55] doing right now
[44:56] so i appreciate that song that lord
[44:58] whatever you're doing in this season
[45:00] don't do it without me
[45:02] come on so i want to talk about the
[45:03] opening of the eyes it's something here
[45:06] how
[45:07] you know like it says here in the
[45:08] scriptures the men they were sad
[45:12] and they were sad because of what had
[45:13] happened come on
[45:15] and now see how
[45:17] you know jesus they were thinking about
[45:19] those things which had taken place
[45:21] and as they were pondering on those
[45:23] things then that's when jesus showed up
[45:26] do you believe that this morning
[45:28] so you know a lot of times you know as
[45:31] he said that a lot of times christ don't
[45:34] come near because we got our mind on
[45:35] everything else
[45:37] we're thinking about everything else but
[45:39] him
[45:40] but when you get your mind on jesus
[45:42] sometimes we worry we have word about uh
[45:45] why we're going through these things and
[45:47] while we're going through those things
[45:49] and it calls us to have those restless
[45:51] nights but i believe that it's something
[45:53] about the mind come on you got to get
[45:56] your mind on him now
[45:57] cause he said the mind that's on him
[45:59] he'll still keep at what perfect peace
[46:02] why how could he keep you at perfect
[46:04] peace because when your mind is on him
[46:07] that's when he'll show up come on
[46:09] lord i'm like they say lord i'm
[46:10] dependent on you
[46:12] to see us through come on in the midst
[46:14] of all of what you're going through now
[46:16] keep your mind on god
[46:18] in the midst of all the waves and the
[46:20] wind being busterous keep your mind on
[46:22] him now come on and everything will be
[46:24] all right do you believe that this
[46:25] morning so we find that it says that
[46:28] they were pondering on these things but
[46:30] you know as they pondering on these
[46:32] things and all of a sudden jesus show up
[46:35] come on and jesus began to ask them he
[46:38] said why are you
[46:39] walking and you know paraphrasing it
[46:42] being so sad come on
[46:45] and they begin to say to him
[46:47] well are you a stranger you don't know
[46:49] what happened come on
[46:51] the one that we had our faith in
[46:54] that we thought to be the messiah the
[46:57] one who we trusted in he don't let us
[47:00] down come on
[47:01] not only they said that he let us down
[47:03] but you know he told us that he would
[47:05] rise again
[47:07] and even though people came and
[47:09] testified
[47:11] that just what he said it came to pass
[47:14] that we seen him come on
[47:17] we went to where they laid him and he
[47:19] ain't there no more come on not only
[47:21] that but we seen angels come on
[47:24] not only did we see angels but we saw
[47:26] him come on he's alive and well come on
[47:30] but yet even though the people come to
[47:33] them to testify
[47:35] that just what he said he'll do
[47:37] he did it they still didn't believe it
[47:39] come on
[47:41] because they were walking and they were
[47:42] what sad
[47:43] i thought about that even today no
[47:46] matter how much somebody testified to
[47:49] you come on to tell you that jesus
[47:52] christ is the same yesterday today and
[47:54] forever hallelujah
[47:56] still when you're going through your
[47:58] time hallelujah when you're going
[48:00] through your period of doubting
[48:02] worriation hallelujah your trial and
[48:04] your tribulation hallelujah sometimes we
[48:07] still don't want to believe the report
[48:09] do you believe that this morning
[48:11] come on but we find that i said that you
[48:14] know they were walking
[48:16] they were sad but i said if they only
[48:19] knew hallelujah what had just taken
[48:22] place
[48:23] if they only knew
[48:25] the victory that was won
[48:27] what looked like was a defeat it was
[48:30] actually a victory wasn't it
[48:32] come on and how many times i thought
[48:34] about it just going down the other day
[48:36] in in the road and i said sometimes a
[48:39] lot of things happen to us that look
[48:41] like defeat
[48:43] but you give god some time come on
[48:47] let god have his way just a little while
[48:49] now
[48:50] it might have looked like a defeat
[48:52] but in the end
[48:54] when you look back at it
[48:56] you said that god meant it for my good
[48:59] you look at all those weapons that was
[49:01] formed against you
[49:02] and then you could say none of them
[49:04] didn't prosper hallelujah oh jesus do
[49:07] you believe that
[49:08] come on
[49:10] but they were worried about it wasn't he
[49:12] come on walking because it looked like
[49:14] it was a defeat they said this this
[49:17] great man this mighty prophet who we
[49:19] trusted and believe come on i could see
[49:22] how some of them may have went back in
[49:24] their minds hallelujah and say all of
[49:27] the mighty works that he done how he
[49:30] walked on water
[49:32] how he broke the bread and fed 5 000.
[49:35] how he raised lazarus from the dead
[49:38] hallelujah how when the people had so
[49:40] much faith once and they took the roof
[49:42] off of a man's house
[49:44] and laid the man down on a cot how he
[49:47] looked at that man and he said take up
[49:49] that bed and walk
[49:51] oh this mighty man
[49:54] went down in the
[49:57] they feet on but they didn't understand
[49:59] that he didn't go down and defeat
[50:02] this mighty man that that we saw do all
[50:05] these great things and
[50:06] how he let those soldiers whip him
[50:09] how he let him pull the hair out of his
[50:11] face come on
[50:12] how he let him spit on him talk to him
[50:15] like he was nothing hallelujah he went
[50:18] down in defeat looked like
[50:20] but what jesus began to show on that hey
[50:23] you were looking at it but you didn't
[50:25] understand what you were seeing come on
[50:28] you didn't understand isaiah 53
[50:31] hallelujah who has believed our
[50:33] reporting whom is the arm of the lord
[50:35] revealed it was power in what they were
[50:37] looking at
[50:38] hallelujah oh jesus
[50:40] come on
[50:42] in weakness that's when god is strong
[50:45] when i'm weak that's when he's strong
[50:47] you might be looking at my weaknesses
[50:50] hallelujah but when i get all i can do
[50:53] when i give up trying hallelujah and i'm
[50:56] just going to stand
[50:58] that's when my strength comes
[51:03] because he is my strength
[51:05] i don't know about you but i always say
[51:07] like this when situations hit i got this
[51:10] little thing i say to myself i said i
[51:12] know what i'ma do
[51:14] i'm gonna trust god hallelujah
[51:17] i say you know what i know what i'm
[51:18] gonna do i'ma wait on guard
[51:21] you know what i'm gonna do i'mma praise
[51:23] god hallelujah why because i know where
[51:26] my help come from oh jesus do you know
[51:28] where your help come from this morning i
[51:31] said but it's the opening of the eyes
[51:33] they were seeing they were seeing these
[51:35] things and
[51:36] and they didn't know
[51:38] what they were what they were seeing
[51:39] come on
[51:40] they couldn't recognize it and that's
[51:42] why jesus when he stepped out he began
[51:44] to say to him he said why are you so sad
[51:47] folk come on
[51:48] he says have not christ suffered these
[51:51] things come on and rise again on the
[51:53] third day you don't know what you're
[51:55] looking at let me let me open your eyes
[51:57] a little bit hallelujah
[51:59] and that's what the holy ghost even has
[52:01] to do in our lives today come on when
[52:03] you going through come on when the enemy
[52:06] has come in like a flood
[52:07] sometimes the holy ghost got to come in
[52:09] the room and say hey don't you know what
[52:11] you're looking at
[52:13] why are you sitting in the corner so sad
[52:15] don't you understand what's taking place
[52:18] the enemy is coming like a flood now the
[52:20] angels of god are here hallelujah
[52:22] to do what lift up the standard do you
[52:25] believe that hallelujah oh i believe
[52:28] that with all of my heart it never felt
[52:31] failed one time when the enemy came
[52:34] rushing in
[52:35] god didn't swoop down to the rescue
[52:38] god didn't take me by the hand and lead
[52:40] me on
[52:41] hallelujah do you believe that
[52:45] oh jesus come on that ought to do
[52:47] something to your heart
[52:49] don't you know god is bringing you
[52:50] through stages come on
[52:52] what you going through right now is just
[52:54] a stage to get you where you got to go
[52:56] next
[52:57] i said what the devil cast as a
[52:59] stumbling block
[53:00] god use it to make a stepping stone for
[53:03] you come on all you're doing is doing
[53:05] what's stepping a little bit higher come
[53:07] on when we talk about stepping stone
[53:09] what are you doing building your
[53:10] stairway i believe that
[53:12] onto eternity hallelujah we ain't going
[53:15] down but we going up
[53:17] do you believe that
[53:18] every round go higher and higher until
[53:21] one day god i believe will come down and
[53:23] swoop us up and take us away from here
[53:26] hallelujah
[53:28] oh jesus
[53:29] i believe that
[53:31] come on i was listening to that song
[53:33] last night on the other shore come on
[53:36] say no more sorrows no more weeping
[53:39] all of our troubles we'll be gone
[53:42] aren't you longing for that day
[53:44] hallelujah
[53:45] cause we're living in a world of trouble
[53:48] sometimes you're afraid to answer the
[53:49] phone because you don't know what's
[53:50] gonna happen next
[53:52] but nevertheless it'll be a day when all
[53:54] the tears will be wiped from your eyes
[53:56] all of the trouble will be gone
[53:59] and what we'll be living with the lord
[54:00] and joy forevermore do you believe that
[54:04] hallelujah
[54:05] but i said the opening of the eyes
[54:07] sometimes how it says you know a lot of
[54:10] what looked like a defeat was actually a
[54:12] victory wasn't it
[54:14] what god
[54:15] what jesus was doing here at calvary
[54:18] what was he doing restoring things
[54:20] hallelujah
[54:21] from where man had fallen if they could
[54:24] only see what was taking place on
[54:26] calvary even even the devil didn't know
[54:29] it he said if had he known he wouldn't
[54:31] have crucified him ain't it had he known
[54:33] that he was gonna rise like we was
[54:35] preaching with all power come on he said
[54:38] all power has given unto me in heaven
[54:40] and earth had the devil known it he
[54:41] would have never crucified him wouldn't
[54:43] he
[54:43] but to be able to look at and see have
[54:47] your eyes open to what calvary was doing
[54:50] i see those saints of old like they talk
[54:52] about elijah elijah and elijah and all
[54:55] of those can say that's what we
[54:56] testified about that's who we've been
[54:58] waiting on the savior to come hallelujah
[55:01] so what did calvary do calvary wasn't a
[55:04] defeat but calvary was a victory we
[55:07] looked at calvary as a victory victory
[55:09] over the enemy victory for our healing
[55:12] victory for our deliverance victory for
[55:14] our peace it was all wrapped up in
[55:16] calvary
[55:20] hallelujah
[55:21] that was the greatest victory ever wrote
[55:23] ain't it come on my savior come on my
[55:27] king of kings and my lord of lords here
[55:30] he is hallelujah when the devil had grip
[55:33] on your life when he had rights come on
[55:35] against your life and he can sometimes
[55:37] do what he wants but nevertheless now
[55:40] the blood is about to be said hallelujah
[55:42] and when the blood is said you can apply
[55:44] that blood over your life and the devil
[55:46] don't have no right hallelujah to come
[55:49] in your home he don't have no right
[55:52] to touch your body hallelujah why
[55:54] because the blood has been applied
[55:56] oh jesus
[55:58] and there's power
[56:00] wonder working power in that blood that
[56:02] was said that blood's got so much wonder
[56:05] work and power it can wash away your
[56:07] sins when you stand before god and then
[56:10] the devil is accusing you he don't even
[56:12] see it why because of the blood that was
[56:14] said hallelujah
[56:16] oh jesus
[56:19] one of my favorite scriptures ephesians
[56:21] 4
[56:22] how
[56:23] you know it says that we in all in times
[56:26] past walk according to the
[56:28] course of this sinful flesh and all
[56:30] these things just paraphrasing it he
[56:32] said we walk that way but then he goes
[56:34] on a little bit further to say but god
[56:37] hallelujah
[56:39] come on but god
[56:41] hallelujah who was rich in mercy
[56:45] oh yes
[56:46] i was a sinner once but god
[56:49] hallelujah and not only that i came to
[56:52] him just like i was
[56:54] hallelujah
[56:55] weary
[56:56] wounded oh my god it's sad but i found
[57:01] in him a resting place
[57:03] oh yes but god he was rich in mercy
[57:06] oh jesus
[57:08] you know that's what it is the devil
[57:09] have people bound you try to convince
[57:12] them all you got to do is give your life
[57:14] to god
[57:15] all you got to do is come to him and say
[57:17] lord come on save me i don't know
[57:20] sometimes you don't know what to say i
[57:21] said lord help me
[57:23] because i'm afraid of myself and i don't
[57:26] know what i'm capable of god i need your
[57:28] help
[57:29] and here comes jesus hallelujah coming
[57:32] to the rescue
[57:33] here come the savior carrying a cross
[57:36] hallelujah and he says follow me and
[57:39] i'll make you hallelujah
[57:43] i'm gonna change he said follow me and
[57:45] i'm gonna make you hallelujah i said
[57:48] make me god change me make me over again
[57:52] hallelujah i'm stirred
[57:55] you know why
[57:56] because the devil can't do nothing with
[57:57] it come on you know the devil can't do
[58:00] nothing with jesus
[58:01] come on
[58:03] he can't do nothing with him do you
[58:04] believe that come on
[58:07] i said but what it is god got to show us
[58:09] the opening of the eyes
[58:11] he began to he began hearing the
[58:13] scriptures come on talking those
[58:14] disciples and and then he began breaking
[58:17] down the bible says he beginning at
[58:19] moses began breaking down the scriptures
[58:21] to him didn't he
[58:22] come on doing things and i like how it
[58:25] says did not our hearts burn within us
[58:29] as he talked with us come on and as he
[58:31] opened the scriptures did not our heart
[58:33] burn within us

[58:37] pray i said lord even for our minister
[58:40] don't let it just be me get up talking
[58:41] lord but we need your spirit to come to
[58:44] do what opened the scriptures because
[58:47] when the scriptures are opened by the
[58:48] holy ghost that's when the people's
[58:51] hearts will begin to burn and when the
[58:53] people's hearts are beginning to burn
[58:55] what is it doing burning out i believe
[58:57] all impurities burning out everything
[58:59] that's not like him setting it right

[59:30] situations even may have a situation
[59:32] right now

[59:36] but you don't understand who's backing

[1:02:48] god
[1:02:49] do you believe that this morning
[1:02:51] like i said open the opening of the eyes

[1:02:56] know the private guy says something i
[1:02:57] want to i want to i want to read you
[1:02:58] something i looked it up
[1:03:00] he was saying about the uh word worrying
[1:03:03] has no value
[1:03:05] come on
[1:03:06] worriation has no value
[1:03:09] only thing it does is bring bad things
[1:03:11] on you come on
[1:03:13] but faith has all the value
[1:03:15] so i began to look at variation versus
[1:03:18] faith come on but i said worriation i
[1:03:21] looked up to see what the medical
[1:03:23] field was saying about worriation they
[1:03:25] were saying worrying is feeling uneasy
[1:03:28] or being overly concerned about a
[1:03:30] situation or a problem
[1:03:33] say with excess and worry in your mind
[1:03:35] and your body going overdrive
[1:03:38] as
[1:03:39] you constantly focus on what might
[1:03:41] happen hallelujah
[1:03:43] come on
[1:03:44] it ain't happening yet you just
[1:03:46] constantly focusing on what might happen
[1:03:48] hallelujah come on i believe in the
[1:03:51] scriptures it said the thing i feared is
[1:03:53] what came upon me didn't he come on job
[1:03:56] worried about what might happen
[1:03:57] hallelujah but what it is
[1:04:00] it says that in the midst of excessive
[1:04:01] worrying you may suffer with high
[1:04:04] anxiety
[1:04:05] even panic
[1:04:07] during
[1:04:09] during waking hours
[1:04:11] it says many chronic warriors tell of a
[1:04:13] feeling of a sense of impending doom
[1:04:16] impending doom or unrealistic fears
[1:04:21] come on
[1:04:22] many warriors
[1:04:24] they they got impending doom that's what
[1:04:26] they thinking about it or unrealistic
[1:04:28] come on fears
[1:04:30] ain't even realistic
[1:04:32] but worrisome will make it realistic
[1:04:35] it ain't even likely to happen but
[1:04:37] variation brought it to you come on
[1:04:40] that's what it did it materialized it
[1:04:42] for you
[1:04:43] come on
[1:04:45] says that only increase
[1:04:47] their worries ultra sensitive to the
[1:04:50] environment and to the criticism of
[1:04:52] others come on worriation to make you uh
[1:04:55] worry about the criticism of others
[1:04:58] instead of keeping your mind on christ
[1:05:00] come on the only righteous judge the
[1:05:03] only one that can say yea or nay come on
[1:05:06] keep your mind on him sometimes we like
[1:05:08] to say don't worry about what everybody
[1:05:10] else is thinking what everybody else
[1:05:12] saying about the
[1:05:13] situation what did jesus say about it
[1:05:15] because his vote is the only vote that
[1:05:17] matters come on his vote is the only
[1:05:19] vote that counts but when you're worried
[1:05:21] about it you're worried about what
[1:05:22] everybody else saying
[1:05:25] hallelujah
[1:05:26] but as long as
[1:05:27] he's all right with it
[1:05:29] i'm fine with it too do you believe that
[1:05:31] this morning come on it says
[1:05:34] criticism of other excessive worries
[1:05:37] warriors may see anything
[1:05:40] come on
[1:05:41] you may see anything
[1:05:43] or see anyone
[1:05:45] as a potential threat
[1:05:47] come on
[1:05:48] i say worriation it does what it has no
[1:05:51] value does it
[1:05:53] but fear i mean but faith what does
[1:05:56] faith do come on faith brings the
[1:05:59] impossible possible
[1:06:01] faith says though all the odds is
[1:06:03] against me yet lord i still believe
[1:06:06] because of what your word said it was
[1:06:08] somebody that's going to have faith come
[1:06:10] on
[1:06:11] that and when jesus died they still went
[1:06:13] to the tomb to anoint his body but it
[1:06:15] was somebody that was going to have
[1:06:16] faith to say did not he say that after
[1:06:19] three days he gonna rise again and i
[1:06:22] believe
[1:06:23] what he said do you believe that come on
[1:06:26] what does worrying do tell you how your
[1:06:28] body feel and all these things worrying
[1:06:30] believes in your doctor's report and
[1:06:32] brings unrealistic things to you but
[1:06:35] what does faith do hallelujah faith says
[1:06:37] with his stripes i am healed hallelujah
[1:06:40] faith says i'm more than a conqueror
[1:06:43] hallelujah through what christ jesus
[1:06:45] that gives me strength that's what faith
[1:06:47] says
[1:06:48] do you believe that this morning
[1:06:50] but what it is the opening of the eyes
[1:06:52] but what he had to he had to come to
[1:06:54] them come on and it's something i like
[1:06:57] how he says as he opened to us the
[1:06:59] scriptures he had to come to them begin
[1:07:02] opening up the scriptures not only
[1:07:03] opening up the scriptures but showing
[1:07:05] them come on in the word the holy ghost
[1:07:08] had to show him come on same as it did
[1:07:10] then in the opening of the eyes the holy
[1:07:13] ghost has to open our eyes today
[1:07:15] to show us that we're not we're not
[1:07:17] defeated come on
[1:07:19] but god we're still in god's holy plan
[1:07:22] we're still in god's mind he knows
[1:07:23] exactly where he got us at come on but
[1:07:26] what it is it ain't it ain't in sin
[1:07:28] what's around us but god open our
[1:07:30] spiritual eyes do you believe that this
[1:07:32] morning
[1:07:33] but we find that i says that you know a
[1:07:36] lot of times a lot of times
[1:07:38] we
[1:07:40] when i say the opening of the eyes we
[1:07:42] can believe those things that we see
[1:07:44] natural but remember faith is the
[1:07:46] evidence of the things not seen come on
[1:07:49] faith i mean faith now faith is the
[1:07:51] substance of things hoped for the
[1:07:52] evidence of things not seen for by it
[1:07:55] the elders obtained a good report that
[1:07:57] by faith through faith what the worlds
[1:07:59] were framed
[1:08:00] talked about how you know the things
[1:08:02] that we don't see those are the real
[1:08:04] things but the things that we do see
[1:08:06] those are the things that fade away
[1:08:08] so the things that we see were made by
[1:08:10] the things that do not what appear that
[1:08:13] we can't see so what it is when i say
[1:08:15] the opening of the eyes what what am i
[1:08:17] talking about not of your natural eyes
[1:08:20] come on but the opening of the spiritual
[1:08:22] eyes the eyes of faith that i can begin
[1:08:25] looking to the unseen i can begin
[1:08:27] looking into a realm that nobody else
[1:08:30] don't know about that when the rest of
[1:08:32] the world is looking here in the natural
[1:08:34] yet we're looking through the eyes of
[1:08:35] faith
[1:08:36] we know that we are more than conquerors
[1:08:39] we know that we're overcome by the blood
[1:08:41] of the lamb and the word of our
[1:08:43] testimony oh but everything is against
[1:08:46] what you're saying
[1:08:47] nevertheless i know hallelujah that my
[1:08:50] redeemer lived and in the last day he'll
[1:08:53] stand on the earth i'll say it like this
[1:08:56] he'll call my name
[1:08:58] one day i'll answer and that's what i'm
[1:09:00] living this life for hallelujah hear my
[1:09:02] name call one day
[1:09:04] hallelujah do you believe that this
[1:09:06] morning

[1:09:10] on taking
[1:09:11] taking a guard opening your eyes
[1:09:14] to
[1:09:15] to see and when you know their whole i
[1:09:18] can see that their whole continents
[1:09:20] changed
[1:09:21] their whole attitude changed about the
[1:09:24] situation

[1:09:27] the bible says and when their eyes were
[1:09:29] open they knew him they didn't even know
[1:09:31] who he was until their eyes were open
[1:09:33] and then he vanished out that sight but
[1:09:36] the joy that he left him with
[1:09:38] not only the joy they left him with but
[1:09:40] he left them with open eyes
[1:09:43] now they can go out and testify
[1:09:44] hallelujah that he is risen that he is
[1:09:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:50] what does god open your eyes for today
[1:09:52] so you can go out and testify god didn't
[1:09:55] just heal you so you won't have to tell
[1:09:57] nobody but he wants you to go out and
[1:09:59] testify that the same god that heal me
[1:10:01] he can heal you too

[1:11:58] see like i said when when those brothers
[1:12:00] when their eyes were open it changed
[1:12:02] their whole continents changed the whole
[1:12:04] way they're looking at things and when
[1:12:05] the people eyes are open today what does
[1:12:07] it do it brings about a change

[1:12:20] can tell somebody something a thousand
[1:12:22] times and they ain't heard you come on
[1:12:25] but when god began to deal with them
[1:12:28] when god began to do something now and
[1:12:31] their hearts begin to turn
[1:12:32] then they come back to you and say i
[1:12:34] never saw it that way come on but what i
[1:12:37] never they may even say i never heard it
[1:12:39] like that come on but what it was it
[1:12:41] took god to do it didn't it it took god
[1:12:43] to begin dealing with that individual
[1:12:46] turning them around and i want to say
[1:12:48] god can deal with anybody do you believe
[1:12:50] that this morning i seen where some of
[1:12:52] my friends like a friend of mine uh now

[1:13:04] what it is we might have heard uh from
[1:13:07] the preacher we might have heard it year
[1:13:08] in and year out but one day when god
[1:13:11] stepped in hallelujah one day when god
[1:13:14] began to speak our hearts begin to turn
[1:13:17] and that what made the difference our
[1:13:19] eyes begin to open and it begin to burn
[1:13:22] within us i said let that happen right
[1:13:25] here let that happen right now may
[1:13:27] somebody's heart begin to burn may
[1:13:29] somebody's heart begin to turn god open

[1:13:45] your heart burden because you say lord
[1:13:48] could i have done more
[1:13:50] to reach out
[1:13:52] to family reach out to those but then
[1:13:55] you know it's a scripture
[1:13:58] says god knows them never hears

[1:14:38] with all of my heart let us stand
[1:14:42] is good amen
[1:14:43] i said the opening of the eyes
[1:14:46] come on
[1:14:48] when their eyes were open
[1:14:50] then they knew them
[1:14:52] in a moment things changed for them

[1:14:58] today i don't know what kind of
[1:14:59] variation the heartache of pain you

[1:15:03] but when your eyes is open
[1:15:06] and you know him
[1:15:08] and you know that it's him it's jesus
[1:15:09] come on
[1:15:11] jesus is here when your eyes is open
[1:15:13] and you know that the master is in the
[1:15:15] shield
[1:15:16] when your eyes is open
[1:15:18] says he says fear not a little flock
[1:15:20] come on
[1:15:21] when your eyes are open then you know
[1:15:23] he's been in your corner the whole time
[1:15:25] when your eyes are open and you see the
[1:15:27] host of the lord and kept all about you
[1:15:30] like we said ready to do what ready to
[1:15:31] go to battle when your eyes are open you

[1:15:36] they say what happened is the situation
[1:15:38] over no but i'm just praising it in the
[1:15:40] midst of it because i already know that
[1:15:42] the victory has already won now my eyes
[1:15:44] is open now that god is in control of
[1:15:46] this situation come on
[1:15:49] i believe david said the lord is the
[1:15:50] strength of my life and whom shall i be
[1:15:52] afraid come on
[1:15:54] didn't he say that
[1:15:55] come on the lord is my light my
[1:15:57] salvation whom shall i fear the lord is
[1:16:00] the strength of my life who shall i be
[1:16:02] afraid come on everybody else is worried
[1:16:05] about all this about him but he said the
[1:16:07] bible said david encouraged himself in
[1:16:09] the lord why because he had an opening
[1:16:11] of the eyes he understood that many of
[1:16:14] they said that rise up against me many
