the precious name of Jesus Christ we thank you for the blood of Jesus the washes makes us clean father I just pray God that the word might find preeminence in our hearts Lord something said or done Lord calls you o God to be glorified and to come on the scene for father I thank you in Jesus name amen the book of First Corinthians 9 and 22. First Corinthians 9 22. to the week I became weak that I might gain the week I made all things used to all men that I might by all means save some and this I do for the Gospel sing that I might be partakers there are with you know you're not that they which run in a race run on but one received at the prize so Ron that ye may Attain every man that strives for Mastery is tempering in all things now they do it to attain a corruptible crime but we an incorrupt of a crown I therefore so run not as uncertainty so fight I not as one that beat it the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection least that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway may God bless to read his words you may be seated and Paul talks about in the 25th verse says now they'd do it to attain a corruptable crown but we an Incorruptible crown in Matthew 24 and Matthew 16 and 24 Matthew 16 and 24. Matthew 16 and 24. we want to talk up to you this morning about no cross no crown it's a familiar sand no cross no crown and for a subtopic we should wear a crown everybody feel all right God is good regardless of what we've been through what we're going through amen God is good amen it seem a little quiet and looked like we're missing quite a number this morning but I still God is still good still love the Lord still pressing the Bible I was so excited this morning I just I I find myself just speaking in tongue because I was so excited about the goodness of the Lord and just feasting you couldn't keep still sometimes so you get up and just walk around and just thank the Lord for his goodness you know sometimes amen uh folks amen if you don't experience the goodness of God it's an individual thing you as individuals got to you know pray and got to dedicate yourself to the Lord praise God I can't bring you on fire you got to have your own liquefier amen your all is your amen when it's time to buy you gotta buy for yourself it's an individual walk amen it's not a church it's not a group walk it's an individual amen it's God deals with you as an individual you can't look for the one that's sitting next to you and wanting to set behind you in front of you it's an individual wall no cross no crown oh you will so he says here and uh Matthew 16 24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man come after me let him what we have a problem with that we have a problem because too much of us is in the way too much of uh see if a man deny himself you know Jesus said not my will but let what let your will be done in my life I want God to will for my life but when you get to know Jesus or get to come in contact with Jesus Jesus Jesus revealed to you who you are because sometimes we think that we are a man of one persuasion or another persuasion we have our life already mapped out but God planned for us and God's purpose for our lives may be all together different from what we think that we ought to be and what we want to be or what we should be God has amen his own expectation of you and I you know I thought about in Galatians 4 it talks about uh because we are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts whereby we cry out by father he didn't say amen he said because ye are Sons amen God gives us the Holy Ghost because of who we are you know I I thought about we cannot make you worship God or serve God mama can't make your daddy can't make it it doesn't matter how much Holy Ghost falls on you amen whatever's in you when the rainfall that's what's going to come up amen when the Holy Ghost fall on you you cannot be a Son of God if you never were you a man so you cannot live a Christian Life until amen unless God had ordained you before the foundation of the world to live it I don't care what family you're in I don't care who your mama or your daddy is except you were predestinated in the mind of God before the foundation of the world you will never be able to become a Son of God except you were with God from the beginning I could never be a Simmons amen unless and I was in my daddy are you up man so I have a father amen you know he cried we cried out my father that God is our father isn't it we're Sons and Daughters of God why others don't have that relationship they don't have that amen though they can set in the church and become a church member that can join the church and they can go through all emotions you can never become a son except you were in the father from the beginning are you up man praise God it's by amen by germ seed by or amen full knowledge of God that he foresaw you amen and that's why those Sons and Daughters of God when they're here the Sheep the the shepherd voice they're able to respond others cannot respond they may jump they may shout they've been speaking tongues but the life would never be there amen the only kind of Life they can fruits they can bear is corrupt fruit oh you want me but if the life of Jesus Christ be there if the life of God be there there are bad good fruit and their fruits shall remain why because they got the bloodline of the father they met there of God and their children of God and they're going to bring forth the word of God because they are seed of God are you with me and I want you to know on this Father's Day that we have a father and in my father's Kingdom In My Father's House there are many palaces if it were not so I would have told you amen and he's gone away to prepare please for us that where he is that we may be also are you a man God has a place prepared for you amen only those that haven't healed is here can hear what the spirit has to say to the church others that don't meet a thing because it's not amen he's not their father amen he's not their God so they don't have amen are here to hear What God Says remember those that are chosen of God Amen they are a special inner peculiar people they met their willing Amen to obey their father amen sometimes whom the Lord loveth he chastens he corrects them that he loves are you with me and they're willing to separate your God for your correction thank you God Amen for sin about me in no chastisement of the present seem to be glorious but I had to work oh Hallelujah praise God the mama weapons and daddy weapons it may not seem good at the present time remember when it's all over you appreciate amen the chastisement of your parents isn't that right you may not understand it when you're young but when you get a little older you said thank you Mom thank you Daddy I appreciate it amen praise God hallelujah so no suffering of this present time amen no cross no crime amen maybe I veered a little bit but thank God for the Holy Ghost I just want to obey him amen God is a good god I want to tell you that First Timothy I mean second Timothy 3 you don't have to turn second Timothy 3 and 1 says uh I I I'm not one I'm just going to skip down he said oh I think that's 11 verse all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus not some I want to tell you all them that live Godly yay all that will live God are you sometimes folk wanna they won't they want a crown but they don't want what goes along with get that crime and see all that will live Godly not not some of us amen people think that when they're going to and they're being persecuted amen I don't deserve to be persecuted amen no you're done that's why you act like you act that's how you take chastisement some folk get mad at Mom and Daddy some folk run away from home some folks choose not to obey and not to respect Mom and Daddy oh you want me but you know what happens to those type of children are you with me that cannot ex respect mama and daddy amen they get this set in a lot of trouble they find a lot of problems in life they cannot handle life in a situation amen but just have time to get you ready Amen to handle the things that you're going to face in life so Mom and Daddy correction is trying to get you ready for Life Experiences but some of us won't take it praise God and we run from correction we don't listen to those that amen already passed that way before already experienced some hardships and some pain and some trouble amen and they're trying to keep you from experiencing what they experience in life are you up there but yet we we choose our own path as though mama and daddy don't know but they already experienced the hurt and the pain and the Sorrows of life and they're trying to keep you away from a lot of trouble are you so sometimes we disregard disrespect and sometimes when it comes down to the word of God we have uh those that are children of God have respect for the word of God those that are not amen though they said in church though they go through the motion play their tithes and the offering and all the good things they do amen amen none of that would save them yet in their spirit in their heart their disobedient children because when it comes down to opening the word of God and living for God they cannot live it don't matter how much Holy Ghost for all look at how much they shout how much they speak in tongue they still gonna do their own thing praise God no my no matter what how much the love of God is available for them no matter how many blessings are available to them in the kingdom of God they cannot see Their Blessings they want to make their own blessings they want to do their own thing they want to aim and bless themselves amen but God has a His blessings are beyond that which we can answer we can think God got so much better for us but we cannot receive God a better because we think amen that we can get our own righteousness oh you want me that's a generation that appearing on our own eyes but yet they have not been washed under filthiness that way there's a way to seem right to a man but the way they are death are you up man see sometimes we want to make our own way and do our own thing but we don't want to obey God we have a father that we got to respect and here's the word Jesus said when you see me you see the father amen praise God and he said I am a father of one the Bible said in the beginning with the word the word was with God and word what's God and the Word was made flesh are you with me so God comes down the logos of God the spirit of God come down make himself a body gets inside of the body the Bible said that God was in Christ to reconcile the world to him self isn't that right he came down to die for our sins and that we might not go amen into the Lake of Fire amen he suffered for us amen he didn't have to do it but he did it because he loved you because he cared for you he loved you enough Amen to take your pain and take your shame are you with me so because he took our pain and our shame amen praise God they stripped the neck and he was that was uh that was his it was all shame that they stripped him naked and they nailed those Nails in his hand and they crucified him because he had done nothing wrong amen it was what we did and what we're doing now amen we're ashamed of him amen amen because amen because we don't love him we're ashamed of him we're ashamed of the Cross but he said if any man come after me are you with me for before you can get to Jesus he said let him what deny himself well we don't want to do that we think that I can I can have part of me and then I can still get dark no you got to deny yourself none of you God don't need nothing you have and you can't bring none of that over here in the kingdom of God not your money not your education not your knowledge not your wisdom God don't need nothing you got what God has for you amen is far beyond what you can ever imagine praise God what haven't even entered into your heart what God has prepared for them to love him and if you love God you're willing to forsake all amen this this thing that you're gonna bring over are corruptable they're not gonna last they're only temporary so I don't want nothing that you can bring over here because we are not talking about a corruptible crowd but we're talking about a word an Incorruptible crime so the life that God has given you is not a temporary life a life that's gonna last for a few years but we're talking about eternal life so with this eternal life God has prepared a place for you to live are you with me so God is talking about eternal life a life that you your flesh know nothing of praise God this world know nothing of so God's going to introduce you to another dimension he's going to translate you from the power of Darkness into the kingdom of his dear son amen the only way you could come in the Kingdom of his son is that you were chosen and ordained of God before the foundation of the world to come others that can't even hear don't mean a thing they come to church they don't hear nothing they don't believe nothing and they don't care whether they uh whatever the preacher's saying don't mean a thing to them they have no regarding they disregard the word amen because they have established their own righteousness they're already in themselves think I'm all right everything gonna be all right I'm all right well you got to get rid of that self-righteousness you got to realize that I need God and I need God more than ever no matter how much Holy Ghost you got amen your body gonna Echo and no and that devil gonna bring the old flashback and Paul says there's a war going on in my mind so the devil is going to fight your mind it's going to battle you every day you can't wake up in the morning without a fight praise God but you fighting for a purpose amen I got a purpose implant in mind Hallelujah sometimes folks will give up Paul said I fought a good fight I kept the faith amen I know there's a crime of life amen a crowd of righteousness a crime of life amen it's waiting on me there amen praise God you got amen we should wear a crown brother I said we should wear a crown Shake somebody hand tell them we should wear a crown oh Hallelujah we should wear a crown Hallelujah praise God we may not look good now remember when your father now later praise God you might look good and glorious and all right to the world but later on amen God got white rules for you Hallelujah and that is the righteousness of the Saints isn't that right praise God it's all right to be righteous amen it's all right to be holy nothing wrong with being holy Glory took on nothing wrong with it Hallelujah hallelujah it's it's despised and rejected the men amen we come amen when we saw him that was no beauty that this flesh desired of him are you a man you don't try to be beautiful in this world Amen try to be holy praise God because we find beauty as vain amen praise God all this world has often called beautiful it's a vain amen praise God God wants her amen uh daughters that got a hard Amen to serve the Lord amen to please God isn't that right praise God not the art with us going in but that which is of the heart amen praise God we get caught up in how we look on the outside and our inside full of dead men bones are you with me well we want our inside to be right amen God Amen praise God what's on the inside will reflect on the outside that's why we want to look all crazy like amen we got a crazy spirit inside of us amen when you're crazy on the inside it's going to come on the outside because that's what the devil isn't going to make you manifest praise God the devil's going to make you manifest what's on the inside of you praise God you don't have no choice praise God if in the inside of you you've got a nasty who mean this position if that spirit inside of you you're gonna be mean nasty are you a man if it's filthy you're going to be filthy no matter how you try to clean yourself and wash yourself you'll never be clean with soap no matter how much deodorant you put on you're still gonna be filthy your spirit is going to be filthy no matter how pretty she is how glamorous she looked she's still gonna be filthy no matter how handsome he is and how cute you think he is he's still going to be filthy rotten and no good no matter how he walked and how he carries himself what kind of outfit he put on he's still gonna be a no good rotten no good somebody are you up man because his smearing in the inside it's nothing but the devil are you up there we're in time ties with Children of Disobedience we walk according to the course of this world according to the prince and power of the air and what by Nature the children of Wrath amen but I'm so glad God loved me and it's all my condition he saw what Richard I was and he said come on my child let me clean you up come on daughter let me clean you up praise God aren't you glad that you came to Jesus just as you were just as I was I came and God I found in him a resting place but he has made me glad I'm glad to be a Christian now I wasn't I looked at it oh no no no no no no no no no not me but now I'm so glad

unless you you were chosen and ordained of God to do it you'll never give up this world because you what kind of Worthy you wouldn't think God could give you more than what you want but God can give you more than what you want more than what you asking more than what you think are you with me but we don't believe we serve a God Like That amen we think that we're going to miss out on life miss out on uh on a whole lot of things only thing you're going to do miss out on a lot of trouble amen because the troubles that amen The Temptations and the thing and the trials and tests that we go through as a Christian amen it ought to make us happy are you up there uh no cross I mean the disciples they were thrown in jail Paul inside the water was in jail and still saying for Jesus because they were preaching Jesus they lock them all and they they said in the prison they said about me somebody who can bail me out nope you know instead of doing like some of the people by biting their fingernails and thinking that it ain't real One Day You're Gonna care more about your fingernails then you're gonna care about God one day amen You're Gonna Miss God because in your mind you don't want him your attitude about him one day you're gonna miss him disciples didn't no no talking about Jesus nope that's why some of y'all do I did right and the preacher did me like that it's about to do me like this and the times did me like that how you want to serve a god what did Jesus do to you somebody said accept what God what except what God allows he didn't say cry because somebody did you wrong are you a man sometimes God allows certain things to come your way amen that if God didn't do that what else can he do to make you upset and make you perfect what else can he do to help you be what you are he said well I I just think God just ought to give me this kind of test or this kind of trial I don't think he should take me through oh yeah I know you in control of what kind of trial God gonna give you you want to tell God if you only let somebody slap me and spit in my face I I know I'm a Christian I know it's you Lord and I'll be able to say thank you Jesus they slapped me to spit in my face baby that ain't for you maybe somebody just talking about you and what you need oh you want me oh boy I haven't been through some of that stuff are you up man sometimes sometimes folk can make you cry are you with me I mean folk will make you cry all night long and they think they doing God of service are you up man and they think they the only one everyone [Music] cause you the right one to pick on are you a man God Amen allows folk to pick on you because God is trying to perfect you because it's you that they picking on you got to deny yourself realizing that I'm in it for the glory of God if that's the way God chooses to make me perfect then Lord let me recognize that the Trials come only to make me only to make me strong are you with me God is taking you to the course and he strengthening you every day aren't you growing how did you handle your trial I handled it I told everybody about the law Endeavor lied on me and he told a lie on me and he talked about me and she talked about me and he did this he did that no cross are you with me on that job I just told him a piece of my mind because I was tired though I was a Christian I won't let nobody mess over me foreign [Music] fortitude it fortifieds us sometimes and keeps us in the mindset that we fill a wall around us because our attitude began to develop our character are you with me our character is being formed how we react to our trials and our temptation so we become characterized not as a Christian character but our character becomes one of a corrupt nature one of a Fight Fire With Fire One That Ain't Gonna Take No Mess off of nobody are you with me but when we let God fight our battles as we God I'm telling you about it I know they did it to me God they spit on Jesus they stoned Stephen to death they lied on him and Jesus said why but what you don't let them live no cross Noah we know we don't do that we get out of this lord said some of those demons because the Angels ain't gonna do it isn't
