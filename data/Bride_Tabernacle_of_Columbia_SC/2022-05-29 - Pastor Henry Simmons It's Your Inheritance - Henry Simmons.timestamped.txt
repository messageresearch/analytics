[51:32] and distribute unto the poor
[51:35] and thou shall have treasures in heaven
[51:38] and come
[51:39] follow me 23.
[51:46] and when jesus saw that he was very
[51:50] sorrowful he said hardly shall they that
[51:54] have riches enter into the kingdom of
[51:56] god 25.
[52:05] and they that heard it said who then can
[52:10] be saved 27.
[52:17] then peter said lo we have left all and

[52:34] together who shall not receive money for
[52:38] more in this present time and in the
[52:41] world to come everlasting life god bless
[52:44] you you may be seated
[52:46] amen
[52:49] the young man says
[52:52] good master
[52:53] what must i do to inherit
[52:56] eternal life
[52:59] and i want to talk to you for a few
[53:01] moments we don't have much time but
[53:04] to talk with you for a few moments about
[53:06] your inheritance
[53:08] amen an ephesian warren would
[53:11] you know we play some emphasis there
[53:14] in ephesian one and
[53:16] your inheritance
[53:18] they meant
[53:20] inheritance is not what you
[53:22] labored and worked for
[53:24] inheritance is a gift that was provided
[53:28] to you from someone else
[53:31] amen
[53:32] sometimes the parents will labor to
[53:34] leave the children inheritance are you
[53:36] with me
[53:38] and somebody might you know leave you an
[53:41] inheritance and
[53:43] but i i think the greatest inheritance
[53:45] we want to talk about that greater your
[53:48] inheritance what you really have amen
[53:50] that god has given you inheritance
[53:53] and a young man knew that there's
[53:55] something that jesus could give him that
[53:56] he didn't have
[53:58] the bible said he was a rich and he was
[54:00] a ruler but he didn't have this what
[54:01] jesus had
[54:03] and he said i want it amen so he
[54:05] recognized that he was something that he
[54:08] didn't have that he wanted
[54:10] and that was eternal life
[54:12] i don't have that amen i got money in
[54:14] the bank
[54:16] amen
[54:17] i'm a ruler
[54:19] amen but i don't have eternal life and i
[54:22] want to know
[54:23] what must i do how about you brother
[54:25] sister friend
[54:27] do you want eternal life
[54:29] amen then the answer then to god this
[54:32] morning ought to be a question to god
[54:34] from you good lord what must i do
[54:39] i want to know what you want me to do
[54:42] that i personally might have
[54:48] eternal life
[54:50] oh god he just didn't talk about what
[54:52] much i can do to have more money in the
[54:54] bank or have a bigger house or have a
[54:56] better car amen have friends
[55:00] but i want eternal life and i want to
[55:02] know what i got to do to do get it
[55:05] what must i do to get it
[55:10] so he says here in ephesian
[55:13] it says
[55:14] 1 it says blessed be god the father of
[55:16] our lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[55:18] with all spiritual blessings uh in
[55:21] heavenly places in christ he said he
[55:23] already done that
[55:25] talking to us that saved the christians
[55:27] god has blessed you with all spiritual
[55:29] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[55:32] this is what you have amen
[55:34] so he says according as he has choke oh
[55:37] are you with me i called him as he has
[55:39] what
[55:41] he's chosen us
[55:43] in him when
[55:46] before the foundation of the world you
