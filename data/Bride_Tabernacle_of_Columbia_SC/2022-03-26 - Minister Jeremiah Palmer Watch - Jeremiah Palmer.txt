pray god for the power of god lord to hold him up oh god lord we ask you oh god for your mercy your grace upon your people tonight bless the word lord we ask you god to take control in jesus name amen amen have your bibles tonight we turn to the book of saint luke the 12th chapter in the 35th verse through 40. and i'm gonna let you be seen after i read that and i'm gonna read some something else also but saint luke 12. 35 through 40. let your loins be girded about and your likes burning and ye yourselves like until men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching and that's what i want verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meet and we come forth and serve them if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants and this know that if the good man of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through be you therefore already also for the son of man cometh at an hour when you think not lord we ask you to bless your word in jesus name amen be seated i also want to read luke 21. 21-36 watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that should come to pass and to stand before the son of man amen tonight i want to use for a little thought tonight watch watch i looked up to the word and this little thought here was as i was kind of reading my daily uh devotion in the quarter of the day that i tried to do daily and sometimes even during the day something in it just seemed to caught my attention and i felt like it was so appropriate for where we are at now we were was working with any man working with a sure word of prophecy now and the reason why it is so sure because we are seeing what god has spoken happening right before our eyes and to you and i hope to myself i i say this when we see these things taking place though we have heard of them though we have uh listened to be uh spoken but yet to be able to understand what is going on in this time right now and the servant god was saying that there is nothing taking place that already been spoken of by god and what we are seeing going on in uh ukraine and the different countries and looking at russia and looking at all of these things and threatenings of nuclear war and nuclear bombs and all this terror and terrorizing and killing and and just throwing the whole economy i don't care again and i was saying men's hearts begin to fail because of what they see is taking place many hearts and pretty much well the whole world is is shooking up because they are feeling a threat of world war three they just can almost anticipated that if they do too much to uh intervene it will push this thing right out and they're trying to hold a middle ground they're trying not to really get involved you know in what's going on but it's difficult because you look at lies being slaughtered i'm just not talking about a regular wall but i'm talking about innocent hospitals and children being killed nothing even to do with the real world just civilians and it's supposed to not to be taken place because uh you know it's against the law to target hospitals and with children ad and uh then putting up sign that where they can identify their children are in here in uh the women's hospital where they are expecting uh to have children and babies that have it difficult but it seemed that they don't even care and then they hear the people complaining everybody seem to be touched by what's going on and react to me because they're human beings lives that are being slaughtered they're being killed for no reason at all and i believe sometimes as christians uh we're not uh concerned enough about uh what's going on not even there but where are we at in the prophetic wheeling of god we've heard it a lot we've heard it so much that it will become an old proverb it's later than we think what more uh uh could happen that that's gonna cause the people of god to understand that um it's the urgency and the word watch i like the several definitions of it read it means to keep someone or something under close observation to be a tentative or viligent to keep guard a state of alert in continuous attention in other words we are the worldwide media we ought to be uh on alert i want to say hi alert and though we are not there physically uh in what's going on but yet we are being affected by it one of the major things right now we are seeing is the gas prices and everybody seemed to believe to have something why why why and you know this this or that but the real thing ought to be am i ready are we ready for what is about to take place and if we are not ready what are we doing to get ready you know the bible said this he said examine your own self we are admonished by god that let's take inventory lord where am i at am i concerned about uh my soul do i have enough oil to make it i have i just like the foolish versions took their lamps but didn't took no oil and it's getting dark you're going to need some light but if you got no oil in your lamp how are you going to refill it if you don't have the holy ghost and if you do have it do i have enough see there is no place that you can get comfortable anxiety and say well i'm all right because i'm in a message that ain't gonna work remember the bible says the letter killeth but the spirit give life if the spirit of god has not came and quickened that word over make that word come alive in you sister brother you can't just rely on what we have heard and what we have yes it is the truth but has all my life been effected the way it causes as it said there in luke that your likes are burning oh my let me go back to luke 12. because i believe this is the hour we can't afford it at our laps go out i mean the scriptures say well uh well no our wood is then the fire go out 35 let your loan be girded about in your lights burning this is the hour you got to have something burning burning down in your soul that'll cause you to understand that i don't have time to play around we'll be all just coming to a church service and and singing and and then going back home but yet when we get back out there of a home our life still is not seemed to be asteroid about god we are more concerned about earthly possessions where i can go and what i can get and what i can build and you're bound full and running over and you tear down the old bars and build newborns yet your souls say that i need water the fire is about to go out how do we get the fire to burn again how do you get yourself on fire again see the bible says you have to learn to encourage your own self don't wait on nobody to encourage you don't wait on no preacher at no particular meeting you got to get on fire right now you got to call on god for yourself they understand this is the individual journey and god and nobody else don't want to go lord then take me hard set me on fire regardless of what's going on around me regardless of the education the job market god i need a fire we need a fight that's going to burn continually the burn in the midst of even what you're going through the fire still can't go out see i understand what the devil is using he's using our surroundings he's using our economical status and using these things around us to get our focus off what really matters y'all nothing else matters but jesus come on have what you will here but let me tell you something you better look up it's late you know sometimes you have to pinch your own self and you look around and you look at the conditions of people lives and you look at even the church world you look at you know the message people you look at you know what's going on you know around you and you say god it's like uh a spirit of slumber doesn't ease in and because that we think because of what god has given us in the hour we are all right the disappointment people is not the people on the street the great disappointment is those that went to church but failed to get the oil they failed to get what god is requiring them to have in order for them to make it they're sitting around looking artists saying why do they do it but there's going to be some people that god is going to hurt that's gonna press their way through regardless of what goes on here come on we're not worried about that i worry about what i got up there you may never own anything oppress but so what so what give me jesus you have all of america you have all the good you will have the best of this and the cattle and the great places and the great cars but give me jesus that's all going to matter everything else is material it's going to burn up but you label we work we struggle we we sacrifice for what to get to get to get to get to get to get just about to kill us don't you and the bible say the kids of this world will suck the very life of god out of you but notice this now you have to watch what are you watching i'm watching the fulfillment of the word of god in my day oh whoa whoa ii peter i have to read it because i just can't seem to get away it's like a peter 1 19. listen to what he said he said we have we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you dewell that you take heed taking heed of a more sure word not just any word but a more sure word of prophecy drop down with me 21st verse the same chapter he said for the prophecy came not in old town by the will of man but holy men of god spake and they were moved by the holy ghost and as they were moved they were actually prophesying everything they were speaking of was winding up till this time right here here they were speaking about hundreds of years because the holy ghost moved on them but what they actually was speaking of this time here could there be someone say there has never been a day sister brother like this day we have the days of sodom and gomorrah the days of lot we see all of this coming to pass we see all this happening our laws and everything are just changing to be more corruptable in other words to legalize sin and it gets them so bad that this is going to be no place for us to live you know why because this stay in our home not like this after it burned off and god destroyed the elements and everything that demon powers and everything at the field yeah there will be a command not like this man i have no other hope than just eat live and be merry and died and miserable we ought to be looking forward to the coming of the lord that's why you say my his wife had made herself ready she didn't wait on nobody to do it she didn't wait for no preacher to do it she did it herself why because she was watching and understanding by revelation that day and hour i'm living in we are here now in other words we have a more sure word of prophecy why is it so more sure because they only spoke of it but here we are to see it and yet it's like it don't move us i was saying that our church door ought to be open daily we ought to be laying on the altar oh god i need the holy ghost [Music] lord we need a revival excuse me let me say this lord i need a revival see because we have been trying and and i know that our pastor had been laboring and and the spirit of god moving and warning and and trying to plead to the people come on let's get the holy ghost when 911 helper and different things are happening with uh katrina and i think everybody's saying pray pray pray pray keep come on everybody anybody i don't care what church to go to our door let's pray but you don't hear that call now but god is still calling see that's not man anymore now is god doing it and what he is calling those that he has elected and he put something in them that they got a thirst and a burden for oh god don't let me be this come amen just don't let me come to church god don't let me just sing a song god but move in me [Music] loose that cold spirit off of me god break these yolks but i like him because god said he will have himself a bride amen he will have himself a bride we can all claim to be that but i want to tell you something your actions gonna show your action how you moving with god are we just sitting still relaxing taking it easy to look all that we got now i believe if you want to you can have so much materialistic things can be running out of your mouth but at the end of it what good is going to do you to gain the whole world and lose your soul oh lord go with me to first corinthian i'm going to have to stop watch keep guard be attentive to what's going on in your hour the bible says study just show yourself approve you don't have to put a proof to god but always studying are we seeking the bible says seek ye first [Music] oh you might think you need a house first you might think you need a husband first or wife first but yo you need god first and if you have him you got everything you need you got a house already prepared for you no mortgage on it no light bills streaks of gold on your house no dirt roads no flowers you got the water it is so but the bible said i have not seen is had not heard the thing that god has in store for them that love him do we really love god now you say you do but jesus said if you love me keep my commandments the word that i speak to you their life so to actually show forth you love god keep his word how you gonna keep it except the holy ghost keep you you know my prayer i remember david said like this he said lord hide thy word in my heart that i may not sin hide it lord lord hide the word because uh this word that you're reading it ought to be your food morning noon day and night you've got to get the word to abide in here god got to have something to work with that's why you say if you will abide in me and my word about it then you can ask but if ain't no word in there see the holy spirit lives off the word and we have necessary natural food there's also spiritual food and that's why so many people are drying up and backsliding because they are not eating the word they are not meditating upon what god is doing right now in this particular time of life right now i'll be also remember reading that scripture i didn't go there but it says that something about um about establishing us in the present truth she did a lot of truth but we're talking about present day truth the truth for you luther had truth wesley has all of them had truth but we have present day truth the word for your hour the word that god sent for us to prepare our door he said america behold i send you elijah to turn our hearts back i wonder sometimes whether our heart has really been turned let me tell you something when your heart is turned on god nothing else really matters yes you do the thing you have to do but your focus is i got to keep my eyes on jesus no matter what i where i go or go to school i'm keeping my eyes on jesus i go to work i'm keeping my eye where if i go lord i know you're soon to come you may have missed a lot of things in life that you regret but don't miss this oh no you may have missed a lot of trips you may have listed my good career but you don't want to miss this because this is what as christian what we're living for is the second coming of jesus christ so whatever it's time to get you bind up and entangle shake it off come on somebody shake it off i don't have time for this brother i don't have time for this dipper dabbing to scoop it and loop it i got to shake it off get the devil off here let them know you mean peter the devil know when you mean business you go around saying well you know some of the saddest thing i hear from most christians is this they say well when god get ready um to take this away i said no brother i said there's something you got to do god ain't gonna force you to do nothing but you're gonna have a desire god i don't want this thing i hate the spirit that's trying to hold me into bondage you are not to be bound by these things of this world you ought to be free what did god die for brother simmons did he die to put us in bondage no no no no no what did the message come to do to set us free from these religious spirits that have been holding us in bondage you know one of the saddest things that i've seen and i say about the lord the most terrible thing i've seen when i see christians are in bondage they ain't bondage because they don't want to fight their way out they want somebody to come and say i'mma make this devil leave no you can pray all you want for somebody but if they don't want that thing to go you'll sweat and you'll work you fall out and they still be the same there got to be something happen on the inside of them that they say i don't want this thing anymore i don't want the world anymore i don't want what this world had had to offer me yeah i want jesus and if that means me walking alone so be it come on somebody you gotta turn that down look if you don't wanna go don't handle me i gotta race the run sister you gotta race the run and you better run oh i don't know faster first corinthians i'm going to close 16. thirteen watchy stand fast into faith quit you like men be strong let all your doings be done with what charity with love whatever since these are satanic songs and whatever you do for jesus let it be real come on somebody it's time for us to lay aside every weight whatever is trying to get ahold of you and hold you into bondage you got let's say shake it off i can't afford to be shackled down by nothing but by nothing and nobody [Music] sometimes it get real close but this is the individual journey remember that you love people you love family but you got to save yourself because some people don't want to go [Music] you pull and you try to come on come on come on you better work yourself tired and you wonder why you're so exhausted you're trying to make somebody get something they don't want i mean we got to come to reality we know we want all to be saved we really want you we really wrote everybody you know come on y'all let's get in the ark let's get in the word let's let's get serious about where we at because remember somebody gonna push that wrong button [Music] somebody said well i'm going to wait till i see a certain thing happen that i'm going to really get serious no you won't because if you're not preparing right now we ought to be preparing right now lord make me desperate lord hallelujah make me desperate for you god to give give me a thirst for god like i never had lord lord restore restore that fire lord restore my prayer life you know sometimes you know we got to cut loose some things because we get so busy busy busy so busy doing everything else except god watch little brock watch watch and pray for us later that we think soon and very soon it's going to be over will you be ready will i be ready and brother god is saying that song sometimes he said i'm going to press my way through it it's not going to be a picnic nobody else will just say that come on you come back no no no these you're going to have to press your way through obstacles and say lord give me strength lord to go through god bless you tonight [Applause] god bless you amen praise the lord watch amen but you know not what i or your lord do coming amen when he come let him find you so doing isn't that right our
