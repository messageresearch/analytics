they need a touch lord they need a word god they need something from you and god as a man we can't give it to him but god you said that if we ask anything oh god in touching the greed lord god on this earth that you'll do it lord i pray god tonight that you might bless your children god you might help the those that are in need lord oh god send your word and it'll heal them god i pray that we said i've done anything that's not like that god you would forgive us oh god help us to move out of the way speak to us lord oh god bless your children everywhere all over the land god how we need you thank you in jesus christ's name amen want to look at the book of revelation by god's grace revelation the second chapter is good amen revelation 2 and we can just begin at the begin at the first verse you got to say amen and it reads until the angel of the church of the ephesus write these things saith he that hold the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake have labored and have and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat ought against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore whence thou art fallen and repent and do thou and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove that candlestick out of its place except thou repent but this thou has that thou hate is the deeds of nicholas which i also hate hear he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god the god of the blessed green of his word you may be seated i want to go down a little further to the 18th verse and continue on it it dropped down to the 18th and it says until the angel the church of thy tower write these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like into a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass i know thou works in that charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which called herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication to eat things sacrificed unto idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i would cast her into a bed into them and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i would kill her children with with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searches the reigns and the hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you i say and until the rest of thy torah as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none of none other burden but that which you have already hold fast till i come and he that overcometh and keep it my works until the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and vessel potter shall they be broken to shove shivers even as i receive him of my father and i will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches tonight by god's grace just for a moment i want to talk to you and i entitled it the window of opportunity with a subtitle space to repent amen space to repent you know just look in here and you know we can read on further down but you know just for the sake of time we're talking i want to dwell more on that on that space to repent you know it's something how uh each age you know god here was speaking out you know he was calling out to the angels or the churches but he was telling them uh john i want you to write these things he says because what he was identifying was spirits that would you know attack the churches or be in the churches throughout all the ages but you know it's something like i i it's about god how in each salutation that he gives out what it is is a call to repentance it's a call it's a call to get back to where you left off at it's a call to expose the workings among you spiritual workings among you to let you know that hey you're not where you where you should be and i'm giving you an opportunity a space i'm giving you a call to come back to me and that's what we love about god is that god you know his graces is just something that's what we call it amazing grace his grace is something that we don't deserve never would we deserve it from the way we was born we was born uh uh sinners you know should have been cut off uh from the womb but god by his grace come on so when we speak we only speak about the grace that god has given us you know i think i says lord you know even yourself whatever you do or or if you speak it it's just you it won't have no faith but i can only speak to you concerning the grace that god has given me amen so we live our lives only by the grace of god so we find that here like it says he's called it's a call uh uh to to repentance though the majority of the of the people you know would fall or the majority of the people wouldn't uh take uh uh opportunity like we said that window of opportunity that space to repent though the majority wouldn't take that space to repent you still had a select few and god knew that it would only be a few you know the bible says straight as the gate and narrower is the way and only a few gonna find it so but yet he still extends that that creates that call out because he knows that he's gonna have somebody to receive what he's saying and somebody that's gone won't you know they're gonna see themselves as i believe in the mirror of the word and go see how wretched and undone they are and they gonna realize that lord i need more of you the church world is going on but god what i got ain't enough lord i need i need an overflow and like david said lord let my cup run over he knew he would have somebody that would come to that so he called that's why he says after each salutation to him that overcometh come on hey you know sometimes the world wants you to settle but you don't have to settle because god already declared that somebody gonna overcome somebody and what it'll be it'll be his elect it'll be the wheat it'll be his bride come on then you ain't overcoming by none of your ability because you know we talk about it's not by might nor about power but it's by my spirit sayeth the lord come on and we know that when the capstone was coming they were shoutings of grace and that's what it is it's going to be something that oh that overcome but it's gonna be because when they gave up come on when they got when they got to where they couldn't bear it no more god did the rest how many believe that tonight and i thank the lord for that i say is what it is god works in windows you know it's like we call it seasons and and cycles it's windows you know of opportunities come on you know i remember when i first got saved and you know i had to had to learn that you know you can't always pray like you want to because sometimes your your body or just the present things you're going through won't allow you to to stay as in prayer as you would desire come on but it then it's those seasons where you're able just to pray you're able just to get in there and just flow and the spirit of god come down and that's what it is what it is it's a window of opportunity it's it's space that god is is giving come on and then in those times you you you you uh uh get all you need in those times you store up in those times because maybe what i would say is the winter is coming but nevertheless it's windows of opportunity that god is is working through by god's grace so you know it's windows of opportunity for healing you know god is some opportunity sometimes god he gonna heal you as i was sharing with with somebody even in the scriptures i said that you know the lord said when i came to heal you i found iniquity among you come on the people was crying out for healing and god said i came to heal you but when i came to heal you when that space was open when that window was open i found things among you that i couldn't work among you he says but you got to get that right and i believe that the bible says come let us return unto the lord and he will heal us come on they had to realize that god you know he'll heal us but let us return to him i was sharing with the church on sunday i said the thing is you know he says he that i mean to his children he says that all they that are called by his name that if they humble themselves and pray come on seek his face and turn from their wicked ways he said then i'll hear from heaven and i'll heal you i'll share and i said it don't do no good to pray if you ain't gonna turn come on it don't do no good to cry out if you ain't willing to turn from your wicked ways turn from those things that's holding you back but you know what i said sometimes we don't get desperate enough sometimes the devil ain't beat us up enough i was sharing with my brother i said the thing is i said everybody rock bottom ain't the same i said but you'll know it when you get there come on and sometimes the lord has to do that take you down a little further or get you because god you know you being his child you being his seed he ain't gonna let you go he got you in in the palm of his hand he ain't gonna just let the devil have you so things might get rough and shaken but that's the time you know uh god i was sharing with someone to call the other week and i said the thing is i said god sometimes gets us in those places that we can get rid of the other voices that surround us get along he'll cause people to forsake you he'll cause everybody to walk away from you to get you alone that you can be able to hear from him and i don't know about you but i say when god does that hearing from him means everything hallelujah how many believe that tonight but he says he that hath an ear come on let him hear god works and it's a call to repentance he works in in in windows and in opportunity you know even like we said tell my healing we always share with with the young children that you know about receiving the baptism of the holy ghost come on it says that the thing things only happen in certain atmospheres so when the atmosphere is right then you got the yield to god you can't just sit there like you don't know what to do you got to raise your hand sometimes you got to learn how to enter in come on because why now god is pouring out a spirit i think about those on the day of pentecost when they were up in the upper room come on they stayed there for so many days and we know that the prophet god was talking about them written and work out their differences but when they were in one place and one mind and one accord what happened the atmosphere got right it was a window it was an opportunity it was space and time where god was pouring out of spirit come on was it about to pour out of spirit you didn't want to miss that opportunity you don't want to miss that opportunity even here now you know i don't believe god is done with his people yet if he was done with his people then the rapture would already taken place so it's not that we say that the revival is already passed we know that maybe in the mass calling but god is still working with individuals your revival is still here right now come on all you got to do is enter entering god is calling out to that select few come on and said i'm doing something right now can you see what the lord is doing that's why he says he that hath an ear let him hear i said god open my ears tonight god give me spiritual wisdom and understanding because it'll keep calm as a thief in the night come on when everybody else is slumbering and sleeping remember there was a midnight cry that went out and and after you when that midnight cry went out some found out they didn't have enough all that what the the go out meal so they went to go by all but they didn't know it was too late the window of opportunity that they had they wouldn't have that space to go out and buy oil so when they went out the bible says that the door was shut and they was left out of the marriage supper come on and i said right now is our space in our window of opportunity god like we said he called out throughout all ages whatever he doing calling to a space of repentance that first age he could see them getting off he could try to call them back they wouldn't come back come on majority of them then you could see the next saves and how further and further it got away from from the original how further and further it got away but nevertheless god still had a remnant even in that the thy tyrannies you see how he says that that i gave her space to repent and she repented not come on but even in that how he cast judgment on the age he still has some he said it's still a few that ain't defiled it's still a few that hadn't known as he said the depths of satan and he said and unto them come on he says i want you to hold fast until i come hallelujah we think about it even now you know in the age and in our uh ease that we live in i was thinking i said you know i was looking at something and i said oh god how much the the music has drifted away how much the music has gone come on and you know i was looking at something and what it did it grieved your heart real bad because i said the thing is the music come on was supposed to be something that uh brought the presence of god down was supposed to be before they went out to battle they called for the musicians go out come on and and play get the atmosphere right that when the word come forth people can be delivered the presence of god is already there before the preacher even come out the music was supposed to be something that god used hallelujah you know david when he played the heart when the evil spirit was on saul come on it was it was a presence in that it did something it lifted the evil spirit off of saul's life but look at what the devil has done look at how far away the people have drifted come on satan has come in but i said god you know it's i believe that god can give us the right the right tunes come on he can give us the right song he can give us the right spirit to bring it back come on lord i said lord we desire that when we sing and when we worship god your presence can come down and do something for us get to get the atmosphere right that when the word come hallelujah we're welcoming christ on the scene we'll welcome him into his presence somebody need healing somebody need deliverance somebody life needs to be changed get the atmosphere right hallelujah and i believe that you know i was i had to go and do a little procedure the other day and he was asking me what kind of music you want to listen to and i said i said only you know gospel they said well what kind of gospel and they name some names i was like no no and then it was like well then that's like i said just maybe some southern gospel or something so they got to put it on my ears and and i went in to do the procedure and the first song was seemed to be pretty nice the next one was some rap gospel stuff and the next song seemed to be a pretty nice next one with some rap gospel stuff i said lord have mercy you know just listening to it but i was beginning to think i said lord i i thought about i said it's the truth come on you know you think about in that first stage he says he says i know thy words come on he said and he said and i i he he uplifted them he says because you got patience he says you you hate those uh uh the nicholas and which also hating all these things said but i got some ought against you because you left your first love he began to talk to them about the drift come on you know it might start as a drift but if you don't get a hold to it if that anchor if you don't put that anchor down in inc and uh contain that drift then you will begin to look back and you'll be so far out come on that you won't be able to get back to the presence of god you think about it i said that's what it is when when we see our lives or are god'll expose it see ourselves going in a drift i said god ankle me back down god refill me again god do something lord that i can get back right with you god because i don't want that drift to get me so far away from you that god i can't see your presence hallelujah how many believe that tonight but it says that you know he's called he called out you know to each age a salutation you know of a call about calling out a repentance i see where you are but i want you but i want you to you know to come back to me i want you i want you to come back come on get yourself uh uh back in tune with me come on a space an opportunity a chance to repent i said what it is you know that that there's there's those you know that don't it's like you got to take your christian journey serious come on it's got to be something you know in your heart you know they talk about in in the end how the wheat and the tears would be so intertwined together that you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference come on until when until the harvest time see they talk about the tears then they can talk about it but they won't go all the way in come on they can't go all the way into the new birth why because the the seed isn't in them but the weak they'll go all the way in but look how deceptive it is that they'll be so intertwined that you won't even be able to tell them apart come on but i thank god that god has put something in us that we never believe that we've arrived or we've obtained but all your life all your christian journey you're in a search that god i need more god i got things in my life that i still need answers to god is places in me that i'm still empty and i still need to be filled god you feel me but lord feel me again god do something again in me lord i want that double portion not just enough just to be on my flesh down in my spirit but god i need something god that'll help me hallelujah to know that the battle is over help me to be able to fight the good fight of faith against the enemy and that's what god has called us to you know even as as paul you look at even in his whole life he was always pressing he said i pressed horse mark he said i'm the least of all brethren i ain't obtained yet i ain't arrived yet i need more come on i need more all the time you think i'm dying daily i need more god give me more i said do you want more tonight well there's more of god to get come on he said he says that they did overcome in the first days i'm gonna give to eat or the tree of life come on no longer as you see the chairman's guarding that tree but god has restored us now that we can go back to that tree come on we don't have to stay out here and die come on but you can cross you can pass from death to life even tonight by how to do the spirit of god come on you can eat of that tree don't sit there and starve to death eat of the tree hallelujah you got access tonight you know god has opened the book and it's and it's accessible to you and i come on the book is open as we see the battle between god and satan come to a head god is lifting up lifted up a standard for you and i we're expecting to do the greater works we're expecting to be restored back to when we speak god uh life comes about hallelujah why because that's what god promised us that's how we got the fight come on we ain't gonna be able to fight the enemy on our own you know thinking about how i was reading up upon some things and how the roman catholicism and and how even now today how they was saying about the baptism and i was sharing it with my wife the other day and how they were saying that they was about about this baptism and correct if you've done it that way but what in a lot of the churches are feeding into it come on a lot of them saying they got to go and redo it again all these things i said but what it is intellectual men come on being demon possessed come on smart and make it sound good make it sound right but it's doctrines of devils i said we need more than just intellectual teaching but where's the power where's when the man of god speak i don't want to see what you're talking about show me what you're talking about hallelujah i believe when peter spoke the word the holy ghost fell come on hallelujah i said that's what it is and and you know we look at how how we said the age is drifted that white horse rider come in come on with false teaching he know that the first thing he had to do was get him off of the word get him get him away from the word begin to mix in it then he can come in and bring all kind of chaos all kind of havoc to it drifted to a place the way god he's saying come on y'all got to come back and repent y'all got to come back to him but even though he knew that the majority of the world wouldn't come back he found even in the layout of cnas he says behold i stand at the door and knock come on think about it having church without god in there he had the door knocking but the cry now is not just going out to the church but he said he that happened here come on you open the door to me come on i'm gonna commune with you i'm gonna suck with you when nobody else ain't getting this hidden man i'm gonna suck with you i'm gonna reveal to you things that the world don't know about i'ma give you of that hidden manner how many want that tonight i thank the lord that says what it is space don't you know that you know the call has gone out but one day you know that space to repent that call that door will be shut one day that door gonna be shut and he that is holy let him be holy still he that is filthy let him be filthy still it ain't that god didn't call give us space and opportunity open the window but we rejected the call we harden our hearts but as we said that few come on that elect they are here to call they'll hear what the man of god is saying they'll hear as the word going forth and it'll do something for them how many want to be in that select few tonight but we thank the lord i say the thing is you know you and i as individuals we said you know those windows of opportunity you know made me think about those that were at the uh pool of bethsaida come on you you couldn't you didn't have time as you was waiting on the angel to come in you didn't have time to get up and go to do nothing to go and check on this so go that but you had to be there because you knew that there was a space there was a window or when god was gonna come down and trouble the waters so not were you just only sitting there but you were waiting i said that's what it is come on are you expecting now are you waiting you want the expectation for god to do something you know i said we don't just come to the house of god without expectation but we come to the house of god expecting lord if it don't happen this service i'm looking forward to next service if it don't happen the next service i'm looking for the next service you coming under expectation when you get down on your knees you coming under expectation god i want to learn how to let go let you have your way let go hallelujah lift me up to a place what it is you expect as long as you're under that expectation when it happens you won't miss it hallelujah because you were waiting on it you think about it it says you had to be there when when the water was troubled you had to get in hallelujah i believe they went on the expectation every day but we find that it says what it is what it is even is our our expectation level tonight you know i want to i just want to encourage you encourage come on as that call of out for repentance he says i know thy works come on i see where you are i see come on and i'm calling you to come i'm calling you he that hath an ear let them hear come on i want you to overcome i don't want you to be swallowed up come on with the spirit of this age i don't want you to be contaminated come on with the works of satan i don't want you to be taken and not know what spirit you of but i want you to realize where you are i want you to know who you are i want you to realize where you are therefore you might be able to uh receive the full blessings and what god wants to give you how many want to receive those blessings tonight i said well we got to get desperate enough come on we got to get to that point to where we're looking like we said under expectation god has given us a space amen amen praise god amen space to repent amen appreciate it brother maurice and family this night space to repent amen i believe that god is doing something in the supernatural realm and i believe what god is doing if if you're you're not careful it'll pass right through you right by you praise god if there's ever been a time that the sanctuary don't know what to do with the word this ought to be the time praise god i'm telling the church if the church don't wake up it'll be it'll pass right by you and you'll miss it but we got to wake up he said awake now to sleep and rise from the dead amen awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god this i speak to that chain it's time to wake up church praise god i believe the people have been sleeping too long praise god this last lap you got to give everything you got it's not going to be but if you make it but the fuel that's going to make it those people going to get amen they're going to get about their father's business nowhere you're going to get there except you came from there praise god you had to be amen if you're a son of god now then you always you were there then as a gene see there's a thought in the mind of god before the foundation of the world amen god foresaw you and he for knew you praise god god saw you there and it's mine so much and so that he wrote your name on the lamb book of life praise god even before you were born god said jacob have i loved and he so have i hated god had a amen knew the end from the beginning i'm telling you something got to wake you up something got to go deep enough you got to recognize who you are praise god if you know who

of the holy ghost is moving and it's sweeping praise god is no more amen former and cold you can't fake the holy ghost amen you can't make god vindicate what you're talking about but the holy ghost will vindicate if god is speaking amen it's no more you that speak but he's speaking through you god comes down to vindicate his word hello god praise god that that's why the days of ananias and sapphira is coming cause people have been too long those spiritual minded devils have amen judge the holy ghost too long the animation safari to lie to the holy ghost but god said now the days of
