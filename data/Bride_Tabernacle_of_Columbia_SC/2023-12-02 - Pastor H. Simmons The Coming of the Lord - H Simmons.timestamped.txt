[39:09] are asleep that you sorrow not
[39:12] is even as others which have no
[39:16] hope for if we believe that Jesus died
[39:19] and rose again even so them also which
[39:23] sleep in Jesus would God bring with them
[39:25] for this we say unto you by the word of
[39:29] the Lord that we which alive and
[39:32] remain until the coming of the Lord
[39:36] shall not prevent them which are
[39:39] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[39:41] descend from heaven with a shower with
[39:43] the voice of an archangel with the Trump
[39:45] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[39:48] first then we which are alive and remain
[39:51] shall be caught
[39:53] up together with them in the clouds
[39:57] to meet the Lord in the air and so shall
[40:00] we ever be with the
[40:02] Lord God bless the read word you may be
[40:06] seated I want to talk to you tonight
[40:09] about the coming of the
[40:14] Lord the coming of the Lord he
[40:19] said in the F 15th verse this we say
[40:23] unto you by the word of the Lord
[40:27] that we we which are alive and remain
[40:30] until the coming of the Lord shall not
[40:33] prevent them that
[40:35] asleep the saints that died in the Lord
[40:38] and went to sleep they because we know
[40:41] uh uh child of God cannot
[40:45] die but he said whosoever liveth and
[40:47] believe in me shall never die that's why
[40:50] Jesus said my friend that latter sleep
[40:53] and they said if Lord if he do sleepeth
[40:55] he doeth well
[40:57] and he said he said he's sleeping and
[41:00] I'm going to awake him and then they
[41:02] didn't understand he he said lers is
[41:06] dead amen so he went there and he
[41:09] realized lers was dead and they all were
[41:11] crying and Jesus even wept but he knew
[41:15] that when they said they'll see their
[41:18] brother again at the latter day and so
[41:21] forth and Jesus told them that I am the
[41:25] resurrection
[41:27] he not that I shall be but I am present
[41:31] tense and just as much as he said that
[41:35] then he send and now we're looking
[41:36] forward to the coming of the Lord some
[41:39] looking forward to the Rapture the
[41:42] Rapture means to be caught up the word
[41:44] rapture is not in the Bible some people
[41:46] are debate it and they'll tell you no
[41:49] such thing as Rapture is not in the
[41:50] Bible but we're just talking about being
[41:54] caught
[41:55] up
[41:56] the
[42:00] so sometimes people strain at a KN and
[42:03] they swallow
[42:04] camerel but it means to be caught up the
[42:08] Bible says we'll be caught up together
[42:10] to meet the
[42:12] Lord
[42:13] amen we which the 17th verse says we
[42:17] which are alive and remain shall be
[42:20] caught up with them caught up together
[42:25] with them in a the
[42:27] clouds last night at Mullins I was
[42:30] talking about the cloud but I don't want
[42:33] to get so far in talking about the cloud
[42:38] because you know the prophet of God
[42:40] talked about the Rapture in three phases
[42:44] the shout the voice and the
[42:46] trumpet and we realized that the shout
[42:50] was the
[42:51] message and we realized that on Sunset
[42:55] Mountain
[42:57] the cloud came
[42:59] down and he
[43:01] said he was caught up in the consolation
[43:04] of seven angels and he was caught up in
[43:07] the SE constellation of those seven
[43:08] angels and the Seven Seals of the Book
[43:11] of Revelation which to be
[43:13] open and he was to go
[43:16] back and
[43:18] uh God would reveal the Seven Seals of
[43:21] the Book of
[43:22] Revelation so by the grace of God we
[43:24] realize that
[43:26] the message the Bible was a sealed book
[43:31] as Daniel was told to seal it the
[43:34] prophecy of the book until the time of
[43:36] the end I'm taking my time are y'all
[43:40] With Me Seal up the says of the prophecy
[43:43] to the time of the end not trying to get
[43:46] too excited just want to talk to you
[43:48] tonight but we're at that cycle of time
[43:53] but
[43:54] somewhere in the Bible we have to come
[43:57] to the realization that we at the
[44:00] end and if we I we are at the end then
[44:05] the book was to be sealed to
[44:08] the the end time of the end so by the
[44:12] grace of God let's look at um Matthew
[44:16] 24 the coming of the
[44:20] Lord some people you know says the
[44:23] coming of the Lord and his appearance is
[44:26] two different things and we don't want
[44:29] to get into the debate on that his
[44:31] appearance and his
[44:33] coming but
[44:35] nevertheless we know that through the
[44:38] revealed word of the hour that an
[44:41] invisible Union is taking place
[44:44] now and you and I amen that are the
[44:48] Bride of Jesus Christ we're being
[44:52] united and we are
[44:54] being it's a union bride and the Brom
[44:58] groom coming
[45:00] together
[45:01] amen he said the bridegroom
[45:05] cometh the coming of the Lord the Lord
[45:08] is coming the bridegroom cometh but to
[45:11] you and I it's an invisible Union taking
[45:14] place
[45:16] so the marriage of the Lamb has come and
[45:21] his wife so he said his wife has made
[45:23] herself ready so
[45:26] when
[45:29] you are not married
[45:34] amen but this reunion that is taking
[45:37] place
[45:38] now God is calling you I show you the
[45:42] bride the Lamb's
[45:44] wife so you and I are not just coming to
[45:47] church and not just saying we're
[45:50] Christians but we realize that there has
[45:53] been a invisible Union the the Lord
[45:56] himself has
[45:58] descended and the prophet of God brings
[46:00] out he bring he does three things in his
[46:04] descension the shout the voice and the
[46:07] trumpet are you with
[46:09] me so we know that if he's descended
[46:13] then where is it he's here he's here in
[46:16] our midst are you with him so if the
[46:20] Lord himself is here then where is
[46:24] he
[46:26] amen the bride and the groom becoming
[46:30] one it's a it it has to be that way are
[46:34] you with
[46:35] me so I'm just talking to you but hope
[46:38] you understand when you listen and study
[46:40] the word for your the hour that you
[46:44] understand who's who you
[46:47] are and what's taking place in the
[46:51] spiritual realm because if there nothing
[46:52] that's taking place with you amen and
[46:56] then you see uh Israel and what's going
[47:00] on over in the Middle
[47:02] East Israel is our time piece and we're
[47:04] watching that seeing what's taking place
[47:07] over there then something is taking
[47:08] place
[47:09] here because the natural types is
[47:12] spiritual so something should be taking
[47:15] place in your midst
[47:17] now God is moving now amen but if he's
[47:22] not moving in you amen then something is
[47:28] wrong so by the grace of God I say I
[47:32] ain't going to get excited because I
[47:33] won't bring out nothing I just get
[47:35] excited 24 and
[47:41] three and as he sat upon the mountain of
[47:45] olets the disciples came unto him priv
[47:49] privately saying tell us when should
[47:53] these things be and what shall be the
[47:57] sign of the
[47:59] what thy coming coming of the Lord when
[48:03] you thy coming now they ask him when
[48:07] shall be the sign of thy
[48:09] coming talking to Jesus
[48:14] right he was there with him talking to
[48:18] him are you with me what should be the
[48:21] sign of thy coming and of the
[48:24] what so if he was that with
[48:27] them now they're talking about and the
[48:31] end of the world so you have uh uh
[48:34] references here that I we we're
[48:37] concerned about when the world going to
[48:39] come to end if they were concerned about
[48:43] the end of the world and we were seeing
[48:46] that the nuclear powers and all the
[48:48] earthquakes and all the things that are
[48:51] taking place shouldn't we be concerned
[48:53] about the end of the world
[48:56] but they were more concerned about the
[48:59] coming of the Lord because they knew
[49:03] that you know if we recognize that the
[49:06] world was coming to the end then we know
[49:10] that the coming of the Lord can get us
[49:11] out of here are you with me so God comes
[49:16] to amen he promised that I I'm coming
[49:19] back for you ain't that right he said
[49:22] don't let your heart be troubled I'm
[49:24] coming back for you but the problem is
[49:27] he want he wants us to be ready when he
[49:29] come are you with me but our Readiness
[49:33] is not depending on what we can do is
[49:36] what he's doing for
[49:38] us amen so the brine makes yourself
[49:42] ready because he inside of you is
[49:46] quickening you and changing you and
[49:48] bringing you to the place you need to
[49:51] be so the as you eat the word amen you
[49:55] become the
[49:56] word are you with me so God wants you to
[50:00] eat on the word I I was just reading my
[50:02] Bible this morning and I said how many
[50:04] people read their Bibles anymore maybe
[50:06] they so busy studying the message I said
[50:09] this Bible it it it it must always
[50:13] become life to
[50:15] you the Bible always got to become I
[50:19] said Lord this how good this word is I
[50:21] said it always don't never let the world
[50:24] become stale
[50:27] or something that you don't
[50:28] need the word God will be you pick up
[50:32] you you read in the morning and read you
[50:34] know you go through the day yeah Lord
[50:36] I'm thinking about the goodness of what
[50:38] your word
[50:39] say Amen because he
[50:43] said servant of God said if you want to
[50:45] get closer to the Lord he said read your
[50:47] what read your Bible and pray so that
[50:51] that's the secret of getting closer to
[50:53] the Lord reading your Bible and pray
[50:55] pray he could said well I want you to
[50:56] listen to my tapes and I want you to
[50:58] study them uhuh he said read your Bible
[51:01] and what
[51:03] pray okay some you know I listen to this
[51:07] court I listen to that's fine but he
[51:09] said read your Bible and pray are you
[51:12] with me and and and don't let nothing
[51:15] take the place of you reading your Bible
[51:18] in your prayer life because if things
[51:21] begin to get in your way and you don't
[51:23] read your Bible and pray you know I I as
[51:27] a young preacher we used should have you
[51:28] know ministers meetings all the time and
[51:31] back you know even before we came into
[51:34] the message and and all the teachers
[51:38] that would teach the young ministers and
[51:41] all they always said you spend more time
[51:46] in prayer than you do
[51:50] studying so they always stress if you're
[51:52] gonna St you spend more time praying
[51:56] that God can give you something to give
[51:59] to people then studying something to
[52:02] give to people always spend most of your
[52:05] time in prayer so it's always an
[52:08] emphasis on prayer where's your prayer
[52:11] life so a as it is to the minister it's
[52:16] also important to your Christian walk
[52:19] that you spend your time in prayer
[52:21] because God will let you know things
[52:24] that are to come come are you with me
[52:27] he'll show you things to come but God
[52:30] can't show you nothing if you don't
[52:33] spend time with him
[52:35] praying are you with me your your your
[52:38] prayer life has to be uh very essential
[52:42] very important to you and you learn amen
[52:46] the moving of God and you learn amen how
[52:50] God you you know he He makes himself
[52:53] it's a relationship and you can listen
[52:56] to God
[52:58] and see if you if you're not praying and
[53:01] really getting in tune with God then you
[53:04] just go through the motion and you're
[53:06] always going to depend on outside help
[53:08] and not him he wants to help you he
[53:11] wants to lead you he wants to guide you
[53:14] he wants to be in control of your life
[53:17] so you must
[53:19] pray are you with
[53:21] me so they said in the end of the world
[53:27] so he he told them many things he said
[53:29] Jesus said Jesus answered and said unto
[53:32] them take heed that no man what now the
[53:36] first thing I want you to know
[53:38] concerning your questions take heed that
[53:41] no man will deceive
[53:43] you amen for many shall come in my name
[53:48] saying I'm Christ and shall what shall
[53:51] deceive
[53:54] many
[53:57] many people going to be
[53:58] anointed okay and you shall hear of
[54:01] walls and rumors of walls see that you
[54:04] be not troubled for these things must
[54:07] come to pass but the end is
[54:11] what for Nations shall rise against
[54:13] nation and kingdoms against kingdoms and
[54:15] there shall be famin and pestilence and
[54:18] earthquakes and divers
[54:22] places all these things all all the
[54:26] these are the
[54:29] what the beginning of Sorrow if it's any
[54:33] sorrow is happening all over the world
[54:36] cuz these things are happening and all
[54:38] these things are the beginning of Sorrow
[54:40] okay it says then shall they deliver you
[54:45] up to be
[54:47] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[54:51] shall be
[54:54] what
[54:56] hated of all
[54:58] Nations and you know Israel looks like
[55:01] the victim of that and as Israel is the
[55:05] victim in the natural people of God and
[55:08] out of all the religions of the
[55:12] world Israel the Jews are spotlights
[55:16] just in that little place called
[55:18] Jerusalem and Palestine in that area the
[55:22] Jews uh you know all nations got their
[55:25] eyes on Israel it doesn't matter how how
[55:29] they uh killed those people over
[55:34] in the Israelites I mean the the Jews or
[55:38] whatever the everybody's looking at how
[55:41] many Palestines you killed or whatever
[55:44] so it's a political thing we don't want
[55:45] to get involved in that but we know that
[55:48] as all nations turn and going to hate
[55:52] you for his name's sake so I'm I'm
[55:55] saying you're going to be hated for his
[55:57] name's sake now you think people just
[56:00] going to hate you because you go to
[56:02] church because you say you're a
[56:04] Christian you don't have no problem how
[56:05] many you been hated because you say
[56:07] you're a
[56:09] Christian now it's got to be something
[56:12] that's going to cause folks to hate you
[56:15] amen because your Christianity got to
[56:18] it's got to stand out
[56:22] above and it's got to be something that
[56:24] you you have that that caus them to hate
[56:27] you you know the Pharisees and the
[56:30] Sadducees all came together and they
[56:33] United themselves against uh uh Jesus
[56:36] isn't that right and they came against
[56:39] John the Baptist amen they they see what
[56:43] I'm saying once you become United with
[56:48] him in the right kind of way that a
[56:51] persecution
[56:53] follows
[56:55] because light does not have fellowship
[56:58] with
[56:59] Darkness if you for real and you mean it
[57:02] for real and you want Jesus for real and
[57:07] you're not playing around and playing
[57:09] games uh folk come to church they come
[57:12] to bride Tabernacle they go to church
[57:15] and they say I'm message Believers and
[57:17] all of that but you know if you're
[57:18] really for real you going to go through
[57:22] something it's going to be a different
[57:26] your life must be a
[57:28] different because why it's an invisible
[57:31] union he he he's going to come in and
[57:36] appear in the cloud and we're going to
[57:38] see his corporate body but he has
[57:40] appeared to you as an individual in the
[57:43] form of the revealed word of the hour
[57:45] and that's your
[57:47] mate are you with me so you must
[57:51] recognize amen Who You Are God has
[57:55] revealed himself to you as an individual
[57:57] that's been a
[57:59] uniting you and the word becoming
[58:02] one amen when and and the rest of the
[58:06] world look at it who are you I I I got
[58:09] many scriptures here but like I said
[58:12] before that's what that was the
[58:15] problem the even the woman said Lord we
[58:19] know when the Messiah coming you know
[58:23] what I'm saying we know when the I
[58:26] cometh and she didn't know what was
[58:29] going on neither does the rest of the
[58:31] world know what's that going on now
[58:33] because uh that woman they was expecting
[58:36] him to
[58:38] come and he said when he come she said
[58:41] when he come he will tell us all
[58:46] things are you with me he would tell us
[58:50] all
[58:51] things so it was something about him
[58:54] telling all things he said
[58:57] because she said shall I proceive that
[58:59] you a
[59:00] prophet and when you when you come
[59:03] you'll tell us all
[59:05] things so when she Jesus said I'm he she
[59:09] ran and told it that comes to a man that
[59:12] told me what you think he told her all
[59:16] things amen that ever I've
[59:19] done are you with me see what I'm saying
[59:22] once a word strike you
[59:25] in the right kind of place and God
[59:28] reveals himself to you in an intimate
[59:31] way it goes down
[59:33] deep amen it changes your whole
[59:36] life it makes a difference to you praise
[59:40] God it brings you out amen of a
[59:43] religious spirit amen I she didn't have
[59:46] to come to that mountain no more amen
[59:48] praise God because Jacob build the well
[59:51] amen praise God and neither in Jerusalem
[59:54] but he said the hour cometh and now
[59:57] is amen that the true worship is going
[1:00:00] to worship me in spirit and truth
[1:00:04] brother and sister it's coming a time
[1:00:06] when you're going to worship Him in
[1:00:08] spirit and truth it doesn't matter what
[1:00:11] folk
[1:00:12] say but you got to get in
[1:00:15] him praise
[1:00:17] God and you're going to worship God in
[1:00:20] spirit and truth you're going to come
[1:00:21] praising the Lord your eyes ain't going
[1:00:23] to be on Amen I'm tired I'm I'm going
[1:00:26] worship God in spirit and
[1:00:28] Truth amen God I love
[1:00:31] you I found myself in the hospital just
[1:00:35] you know
[1:00:36] preaching praying
[1:00:39] preaching Lord I love you and brother
[1:00:42] Jones right that with
[1:00:45] me I said and he repeat going right on I
[1:00:49] said to we wake up this whole Hospital
[1:00:52] shake up this Hospital amen so by the
[1:00:56] grace of God but I I I you know you you
[1:01:00] you you can't hold you know this thing
[1:01:03] back now you got to be bold
[1:01:07] soldiers you got to you got to you can't
[1:01:10] hold back letting folk know amen I'm not
[1:01:13] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:01:17] because it is the power of God under
[1:01:20] salvation to everyone that believe
[1:01:23] praise God
[1:01:25] Hallelujah don't be ashamed of your
[1:01:30] testimony so I'm not going to get into
[1:01:33] the depths of you know about the Fig
[1:01:35] Tree and he said now 32 32 he says he
[1:01:39] said now learn a parable 24 and 32 he
[1:01:44] says now learn a parable of fig tree
[1:01:45] when his branches is yet
[1:01:48] tender and put it forth at leaves you
[1:01:51] know that some is not now the fig tree
[1:01:54] is
[1:01:55] Israel Israel had not been a nation for
[1:01:59] over 2,000 and something years they were
[1:02:02] cut off and they were carried into uh
[1:02:05] the Jews were carried into Babylon and
[1:02:08] then the the the 10 tribes are scattered
[1:02:11] in the Syrian and so forth and it was
[1:02:14] just scattered abroad but as far as them
[1:02:17] coming together as a nation they wasn't
[1:02:20] a nation they weren even reckon among
[1:02:22] the Nations they were scattered people
[1:02:24] but God said in Ezekiel 37 son of man
[1:02:28] can these bones live and he said Lord
[1:02:29] God thou know it he said prophesied to
[1:02:32] the bones said oh you dry bones hear the
[1:02:34] word of the Lord and the Israel came
[1:02:37] back together in
[1:02:39] 1946 The Prophet said but in the reckon
[1:02:43] among the nations in
[1:02:45] 1948 Israel came back after being off
[1:02:48] the map as a nation for over 2,000
[1:02:51] somebody said 2500 years they came back
[1:02:55] to be a nation are you with me when
[1:02:58] Israel came back to be a nation let me
[1:03:00] let me read this and show you what he's
[1:03:02] saying uh the the Fig Tree when you see
[1:03:05] the Fig Tree put it forth the leaves
[1:03:07] know that summer is what n amen so we
[1:03:13] getting a little closer we if you read
[1:03:15] the rest of that chapter it says some is
[1:03:17] n so likewise ye when ye shall see all
[1:03:21] these things know that it's
[1:03:24] what you know that it's near even what
[1:03:29] even at the door see it's closer it's at
[1:03:32] the door now now if it's been at the
[1:03:35] door since
[1:03:38] 1948 and he said then he went on to say
[1:03:41] in the 34th verse that's why everybody
[1:03:45] just about that new Bible prophecy and
[1:03:48] studyed the Bible in 88 they was looking
[1:03:50] for the world to come to an end and the
[1:03:52] Rapture to take place and all and and
[1:03:54] everybody was anticipating how many of
[1:03:55] you was born in in
[1:03:58] 88 most of y'all weren't born in 88 how
[1:04:02] many of you wasn't born in
[1:04:04] 88 and after the Raptor with it to place
[1:04:07] y'all would have
[1:04:08] minut you see what I'm saying y'all
[1:04:11] wouldn't have been a part of it so what
[1:04:13] happened God held up the Rapture for
[1:04:17] y'all you know what I'm saying because
[1:04:19] he said here in the 34th verse verily
[1:04:22] verily I say unto you this
[1:04:25] what and they said the generation
[1:04:27] usually is 40
[1:04:29] years okay cuz they the the children of
[1:04:33] Israel wandered in the wilderness how
[1:04:35] long 40 years right and the the young
[1:04:39] people that was born in the wilderness
[1:04:41] they went over into the promised land
[1:04:44] but all the people that came out except
[1:04:45] Joshua and Caleb even Moses died there
[1:04:48] you know what I'm saying and the they
[1:04:52] died except Joshua and Caleb and they
[1:04:55] went on into the promise
[1:04:58] so people that studied Bible said 40
[1:05:02] years is the generation it says here
[1:05:05] 34th verse again verily verily I say
[1:05:07] unto you this generation shall not what
[1:05:10] pass until
[1:05:12] what so
[1:05:14] we I mean 88 and we still here so what
[1:05:20] what are we saying brothers and sisters
[1:05:22] God must have waited on some of y'all
[1:05:25] are you with me he knew y'all was coming
[1:05:29] and he waited other than that back then
[1:05:32] we were so stirred up so fired up we
[1:05:34] thought we were going to
[1:05:37] heaven I wasn't thinking about getting
[1:05:39] married CU I'm going to
[1:05:41] heaven are you with me but we didn't
[1:05:45] go so Caleb is here Josh and
[1:05:49] Rachel you see because we were so
[1:05:51] stirred up because we thought we were
[1:05:55] gone and then the next st came and
[1:06:02] uh the next ster big ster coming in the
[1:06:05] year 2000 because what
[1:06:08] happened
[1:06:11] uh it was the seventh
[1:06:14] day one day is with the Lord is what
[1:06:18] thousand years and a thousand years is
[1:06:20] what what did God do on the seventh day
[1:06:25] okay so 6,000 years so everybody was s
[1:06:28] oh the computers going to crash world

[1:15:55] me it's it's it's getting
[1:15:58] close now okay the natural types is
[1:16:01] spiritual if they doing it there what
[1:16:04] about

[1:16:09] this and I'm against that I ain't G to
[1:16:11] say these things but y'all know what I'm
[1:16:13] talking about what you stand against
[1:16:18] sin amen and people want to sin and they
[1:16:22] don't want you to say nothing about it
[1:16:23] they want you to tell them it's all
[1:16:25] right and they going to go to heaven
[1:16:27] doing the stuff they do and living the
[1:16:29] way they live and you you tell them no
[1:16:32] sir you ain't going to heaven man sister
[1:16:35] you won't go to heaven looking like that
[1:16:37] you won't go to heaven brother doing the
[1:16:40] stuff you doing you're not going to
[1:16:42] heaven oh man you condemn me Jud the I
[1:16:46] say judge you not no the word judge you
[1:16:48] I didn't judge
[1:16:49] you are you with me the Bible judge Jud
[1:16:53] you God judge you judgment begin in the
[1:16:57] house of God okay I got to close Okay
[1:16:59] let me see and I will pour out upon the
[1:17:02] House of David and upon the inhabitants
[1:17:05] of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and
[1:17:08] what supplication and they shall look
[1:17:12] upon me whom they have what whom they
[1:17:15] have pierced and
[1:17:19] see now how in the world they going to
[1:17:22] look upon him whom they had
[1:17:25] pierced except they look in this word
[1:17:28] and see what they have
[1:17:32] done are you with me you think Jesus is
[1:17:36] going to say look upon me whom you pierc
[1:17:38] no those true prophets going to be
[1:17:40] preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and
[1:17:42] they going to recognize that Jesus is
[1:17:45] the one that we crucified and kill whom
[1:17:49] you pierc they G to say oh
[1:17:53] and they're going to repent 144,000 of
[1:17:57] them and they're going to be killed
[1:17:59] because they accept the
[1:18:02] gospel are you with
[1:18:08] me and and and that's what I'm saying
[1:18:10] people look for Jesus to come in a
[1:18:13] corporate body but Jesus comes in the
[1:18:15] form of the word and they can't
[1:18:17] recognize him because the Bible said in
[1:18:19] the beginning with the word the word was
[1:18:20] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:18:23] word was made flesh are you with me so
[1:18:25] when Jesus come in the form of the word
[1:18:27] they're looking for him to come the
[1:18:29] coming of the Lord Jesus is come in the
[1:18:31] form of the word but you didn't
[1:18:33] recognize Jesus because he was in word
[1:18:36] form are you with me but he always came
[1:18:39] that way when you saw Moses come it was
[1:18:43] a God that was in Moses amen and
[1:18:45] fulfilling the word that was spoken by
[1:18:47] the prophet Abraham Isaac and Jacob that
[1:18:50] God said you're going to discern you're
[1:18:51] going to be in the land for 400 years
[1:18:53] after 400 years I'm going to deliver you
[1:18:56] are you with me so what happens is when
[1:18:59] God comes in the form of the word the
[1:19:01] coming of the Lord the Lord come down
[1:19:03] I'm come down to deliver them but God
[1:19:06] didn't come he sent
[1:19:08] Moses are you with me and see when when
[1:19:11] when the Lord comes in the form of the
[1:19:14] rapturing of the bride and getting the
[1:19:16] church ready for Rapture the Lord comes
[1:19:19] according to the word but we missing
[1:19:22] because some sometimes he's
[1:19:25] veiled he's veiled in flesh just like
[1:19:28] you and I amen as the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:31] Christ they don't believe that you amen
[1:19:34] a m Jesus Christ amen you don't they
[1:19:37] don't believe that because they didn't
[1:19:40] believe he was and they can't see amen
[1:19:44] but you it's because of what you believe
[1:19:46] you see and you believe you've accepted
[1:19:50] amen what the blood oh
[1:19:53] that was shed for you him whom they
[1:19:56] pierc and it
[1:20:00] says and they shall mourn for him as one
[1:20:05] mourneth for his only son and shall be
[1:20:09] in bitterness for him as one that in
[1:20:15] bitterness for his first born and in
[1:20:18] that day shall there be a great mourning
[1:20:22] in
[1:20:23] Jerusalem as the morning
[1:20:26] of
[1:20:28] ha da in the valley of
[1:20:34] me I'm telling
[1:20:36] you it's all going to be over after a
[1:20:40] while and will you be ready uh for the
[1:20:43] coming of the Lord if he comes in word
[1:20:46] form would you recognize him and I said
[1:20:50] he has come as he said said Lord we
[1:20:54] thought that Elias was first come and
[1:20:57] restore all things and he said I'm
[1:21:01] telling
[1:21:02] you Elijah has come
[1:21:06] already and you missed
[1:21:08] him and that was John the Baptist that
[1:21:11] he's talking about are you with me but
[1:21:13] he said Elijah shall first come and
[1:21:16] restore all things and he comes to
[1:21:19] restore all things in this hour but who
[1:21:21] going to believe that
[1:21:23] P he didn't believe John he cut his head
[1:21:25] off neither do people think we don't
[1:21:28] need you we got Moses Abraham Isaac and
[1:21:30] Jacob I'm saying brother and sisters it
[1:21:33] comes a time when you as the Bride of
[1:21:35] Jesus Christ wake up and see amen God is
[1:21:39] soon to come this thing is
[1:21:42] getting it's getting
[1:21:45] rough some of the news reporters they
[1:21:47] said that America is backing up from
[1:21:51] Israel
[1:21:53] and the nations are getting the little
[1:21:55] that's back in Israel they it's a lot of
[1:21:58] pressure getting out there it's a lot of
[1:22:01] pressure they want to be they want to
[1:22:04] want to stick with them but it's a lot
[1:22:06] of pressure it's a lot of chaos going on
[1:22:10] you got to know where you
[1:22:12] standing you got to know what's going on
[1:22:15] you got to know that you got to keep
[1:22:16] your eyes on
[1:22:18] Jesus and and your walk with God you got
[1:22:21] to know that any time this thing can
[1:22:23] break wide
[1:22:24] open and if it does where you going to
[1:22:28] be if it does
[1:22:33] happen God only
[1:22:35] knows I want to keep my eyes on
[1:22:38] Jesus and I want to be ready for the
[1:22:42] Rapture because all of this I can so I
[1:22:46] said well you you're saying that the
[1:22:49] Jews are right and Palestinians wrong I
[1:22:52] getting involved in all of that all I
[1:22:55] know is that we got to be
[1:22:57] ready are you with me I'm not getting
[1:23:01] involved with the Palestines with the
[1:23:03] Jews all of that I said you got to be
[1:23:06] ready are you with me said brother
[1:23:09] Simmons you know you need all that

[1:23:14] world Satan got control over with all of
[1:23:17] that amen but God people shall be
[1:23:21] delivered and that's what we got to be
[1:23:23] concerned where you standing with God
