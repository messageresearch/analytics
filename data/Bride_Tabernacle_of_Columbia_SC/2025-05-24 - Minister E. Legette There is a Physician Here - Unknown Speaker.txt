Because you never fail, Lord. So, I trust you. I trust you to see us through. I trust you to touch tonight. touch you to meet trust you to meet each and every need. Lord, oh Jesus, you never failed and you never will. Lord, we thank you tonight, God. We pray, Lord, by the Holy Ghost, Lord, tonight that if we said or did anything that ain't like you, Lord, that would hinder the move of God. Lord, I pray, oh God, that you would help us, God, to get out of the way and oh God, forgive us of our sins, Lord. Oh God, bless your children tonight. Look over the sick and afflicted, Lord. Oh God, those that need a touch, Lord. Those that are going through mind battles, oh God, situations have got them in dire straits. But nevertheless, oh God, you can lead them in wisdom and direction. Help your children tonight. Bless us, God, in a mighty way. For we look to you. We love you with all our hearts. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Let the church say, "Amen." Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We want to look at the book of Jeremiah by the grace of God tonight. I trust in God. Amen. I was laying on bed the other day. I must have forgot all about that song. I was laying on the bed the other day meditating on the Lord and I I just kept saying, "God, I trust you." Amen. Amen. Sometimes we say you don't know where to go. He might show you things to come, but he don't always show you how you going to get through it. Amen. But I said, "Lord, I trust you." Amen. One day at a time. Amen. Amen. One step at a time, one mountain at a time. I know one thing. He never failed. Amen. So, I put my life in his hands. Amen. I put everything I got in the master's hands. Cuz I know he'll hold it. Amen. I have no doubt about that. Amen. God is good. Tonight, we want to look at the book of Jeremiah 8. by the grace of God. And we'll drop down to the we just go down to the to the 17th verse. We start let's we can just start here at the 20th verse. Let's cut the time short. 8 and 20. You got to say amen. Amen. And it reads, "The harvest is passed. The summer is ended, and we are not saved. For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt? I am black. Astonishment have taken hold on me. Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?" May God bless you. You may be seated. Amen. Tonight we want to talk here just for a moment. Amen. Won't be long. And I entitled it there is a physician here. Amen. Amen. There is a physician here. You know I think I know God God has hallelujah been blessing us. Amen. I says you know here God has sending Jeremiah out to cry you know against the sins of the land in that day. And right here he's saying, you know, he's I guess standing wherever he's standing at prophesying, he's saying, you know, is there no bomb in Gilead, right? Is there no physician? Because looking at the condition of the people, you would think there wasn't one. Amen. But not only is there a physician, was there a physician here? There. And as I say tonight, there is a physician here, but he is the greatest physician. Amen. He's the greatest of all, right? But yet the people are still, you know, sometimes, you know, I I remember I was reading in second Kings, I I believe it was in in uh the king of Samaria and how he that war with Moab and fell through the the roof of what whatever it was, and hurt himself. So he he sent his people to go ask of of the God of acron will he get up off of that bed. But God, you know, gave Elijah a word. And that word he came to him and met him. He said, "Is there no God in Israel?" Come on. That was an insult. He said to him that there is a God there. But yet you going, he said, "And why you going to ask Bible?" Right? And many of times you'll look at some of the things of of of lives and the the the judgments I mean or or the uh you know things they choose and you might say is there no do they not know it's a god? Amen. Do they not have a god that they can go to? Cuz of the choice they made. You would think they didn't have a god they can go to. Come on. But we go to sometimes everybody else but God, right? We talk amongst everybody else talk and make decisions swift whatever and say, "Oh, that's just minor, minor, minor." But you know the Bible says to trust in the Lord with what? All thine heart and lean not to your own understanding. But in all of your ways, right? All of your ways. Say that's a minor. This is something small. All of your ways do what? Acknowledge him and he'll do what? He'll direct you, won't he? I don't know about you, but we need direction of the Holy Ghost. Amen. I says I was I was sharing uh I said, you know, the Lord sometimes he'll do supernatural things and show you things to come, show you times that's coming up ahead, but he don't necessarily always show you how you going to get through them, right? And sometimes you say, "I know the battle that's coming. I know the storm that's raging." But then you get down on your knees and you start praying, Lord, give me the wisdom to get through it. Come on. Cuz whatever you're trying to uh get out of me or whatever you're trying to do in me, I don't want to have to deal with this again. So Lord, help me to get through it. Amen. So that's what we pray, Lord, as we see things uh uh coming down to its climax in your natural natural lives, right? in your in your closer families everything around the world itself you say God this is the time now I can't live loosely right but this is the time now that I I have to really draw from the wisdom of God right really draw from not only his wisdom but you got to draw from his strength amen hallelujah so I says that you know he was asking the question is there no physician here you know he is the great physician do y'all Y'all believe that tonight. Amen. You know, I was I was thinking the other day they called us in and my grandmother down there, but they were saying, "Anybody want to come see her, come see her." You know, didn't think she going to make it through the night. You go there, she's just sitting there and uh she hadn't really been eating in a long time. So, everything is look like it's taking its toll. But after everybody done came through and praying, Amen. After all, everybody came through and prayed and did all that, the next day my mom them called me and was like, "Yeah, she up. She want to talk to you." So I I'm thinking, "Yeah, okay." So they put her on the phone and she talking just you wouldn't know she's in the hospital. And she kept saying, "Jermaine, she called me Jermaine, I want you to come see me." And that got me because she don't really remember who I am for months now. And they said she done drunk coffee, been eating. And then she told me while I was on the phone, I'm hungry. Right. And several people saying that's all she been saying how hungry she was. But they said they couldn't give her no solid food, whatever being. So she said, I want you to come see me tonight. And it's it's, you know, about late already late in the evening. I said, "Grandma, I can't come tonight." She said, "Well, I want you to come in the morning, you know." So I said, "Okay, I'll come in the morning." So I end up going down there uh Tuesday. Got off work that Tuesday morning. But and I went down there. When I went down there and seen her, she looked like she kind of went back to what she was Sunday. But a lot of times people say, "Oh, they're going to have one one last thing." And and they come up with these sayings and some of them may be true, but what I look at is this. All it takes is for God to move his hand. Come on. We can put it on the wisdom of doctors, science, all this and and and and great sayings, but what I look at is like this. All it takes is for God to move his hand. God to move his hand to restore appetite, restore mind, restore all if he want to do it now. Come on. Come on. That's right. Now I said that because just looking at that situation, that's I you know, you always believe that. But I says that God's will going to be done, you know, in every situation. But what I'm talking about to you personally tonight, God has complete control. Amen. But what happens? We don't we don't remember that he is the great physician. Come on. God can move mountains, right? Charlton was telling me the testimony of the person that got healed from cancer. I think Sister Anna was talking about the other night. But God moves mountains, don't he? He's He's still the great physician, ain't he? Come on. He's still the healer. But see what it is today, people's minds are are they they going so much into because of they know so much, know this, and know that. This is how it always been. This right. But the thing I'm looking at is it's not in what we know. That's right. And what we can do physically, but everything is moving by the power of God. Come on. Everything. Come on. Not by you ain't about the one that can run and all that. It's by the power of God. Come on. That all these things are moving. So we we start living life everything you know it is moving by the power of God. Right. And I said, "Lord, that's what it is." See, we come to that place. I was I was sharing with Charlotte today about something, you know. I says, "This situation right here, I ain't worried about that because God is the righteous judge." That person right there or that situation is can only do what God allowed them to do. Amen. Come on. And that's for real. Amen. I They only can do only power they got is the power that God give them. Amen. And the and the the judgment that God's making, he's a righteous. I know his his decision, the judgment he make is right. Amen. Come on. So when it when it all comes down to the end, I can say, "Lord, thank you." Come on. Because you did right, didn't you? Come on. And all things Hallelujah. I'm going to give thanks, right? Come on. Because all things work together for what? Good of them. Oh, look at where you at. Come on now. Uh-uh. All things work together for the good of them. Come on. We're not Say we ain't doing that. Come on. All things. Come on. Whether you're up, whether you're down, it's working for your good. Whether it got worse, whether it didn't, it's working for your good anyhow. Come on. But the thing is, I I says, I don't know about I I says, we come to church, right? But do you really believe that God is all powerful? Come on. Many people go to church, but they don't believe in the supernatural. Come on. So, not to believe in it, they don't look for it. Right. Amen. They look for sayings and all these things. But I says if God ever was God, he's still God. Right? Come on. And his power is the same. He don't fade or or lose with time. It don't matter what nobody says. He is the same yesterday, today, and what? Forever. The things he done, he's still capable of doing them. Come on. And can't nobody take you away from that. Once God do something, that's why you need God to do something for you. Come on. That's why it's got to become a personal relationship. Cuz mama gone, grandma gone, whoever gone. Then do you know God for yourself? Come on. You got to know him for yourself. Hallelujah. But in order to do that, he's got to do something personally for you, right? Come on. And then when when God do see, nobody can't shake you away from that because you know it was God. Come on. And it's still God right now. But I says, you know, there is a physician here. Come on. God is still still healing. Now, now there's two types of healing we can look at. Uh uh sickness is natural and spiritual. Come on. But to be healed in the natural and yet your soul is sick didn't do you no good. That's right. Did it? Come on. I was thinking of somebody just the other day he got rushed to the hospital and and uh said he almost hemorrhaged to death and is in ICU and it's like everybody say a prayer. So you know I I said I'm I'm praying for him, right? So pray for him and all and and then uh you know that's that person we praying for that's in ICU. They responded back all is well. Amen. But by the end of the day that person was right back to normal before they even got out the hospital. I can't wait you got out the hospital this. And I said see it don't do no good for natural healing. Come on. Amen. If your soul is sick, right? Amen. Come on. Somebody say amen tonight. I know I ain't by myself. It don't do no good. Don't do it. I'd rather this body perish but my soul be saved. Hallelujah. Come on. And to be right with God. Reason why we can't see sometimes that the soul is sick. Right? That the church world is sick. They jump, they shout, they holler, all that. But when you look at it from God's eyes, they sick. Come on. How are they sick? Because they ain't in his presence. Hallelujah. It's a lot of emotion. Come on. But I don't know about you, but I want the presence. Why? The presence brings changes. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. It does. The presence will bring a change. Come on. But what it is, God got to show you got to get so sick of yourself. Come on. You got to I'm not satisfied with myself. Come on. Amen. Amen. Come on. God, I need more of you. Hallelujah. Amen. And I'm under expectation for you to do more in my life. Amen. Hallelujah. And God will do it, won't he? But what it is, the people, like I said, is God got to open your eyes to that. And I thank God that that he does that. But it, like I said, is is is two types of sickness. Natural and spiritual, right? But I said, we we we concentrate so much on the natural man. But we'll find out one day that the spiritual man was the one that you needed, come on, to concentrate on because that part of you, Hallelujah, when it it would go back his body go back to the dust, that part of you is going somewhere. Hallelujah. But I says that you know I if God is is really and I I'm just saying it as a question but because there is a physician here. There is and don't let nobody tell you no different. There is a physician here. He's healing the natural body and the spiritual body. Come on. But sometimes people minds like I says they what what's going on? That's why you you you wonder just like Jeremiah here questioning. He said, "Is there no bomb in Gilly? If there's no physician here, then why is the health of my daughter not recovered?" Come on. Is there no God in 2025? Then why? Hallelujah. The people look like sometime they go backwards instead of forward. Why instead of coming to God, they go everywhere else? Hallelujah. Come on. I was talking with Moses the other day. I was having a nice little talk and I said, "You know, one thing I say is what's wrong with Jesus that people don't want him." Come on. They might not profess to you from the mouth they don't want him, but when they reject his word, they show you they don't want them because he is his word. Right? But I says we we we started taking examples out of the scriptures. And I say it's one thing, one thing uh Judas when he sold Jesus, you know, for the 20 or 30 pieces, he say Moses was saying, "Well, was that a lot of money?" Come on. I said, "It don't matter how much money it was. It could never meet up to the value of what Jesus gave." Come on. Hallelujah. But he he thought of it more valuable than Jesus. Come on. And we started talking about the value of Jesus. It's just me and Moses in the garage having a good old barn, right? But I says the value of Jesus, what was his value? I said Jesus value was hallelujah. He was healing the sick everywhere he went. Come on. Struggles and things that been on people for years, but now the healer is here. Hallelujah. Come on. You don't have to worry about it cuz you spent all your money at the doctor and he didn't do you no good. But we got someone that's greater than the doctor. Hallelujah. Come on. His value is way. Come on. His value was Hallelujah. Be thou healed according to your faith. Right? Come on. I said, "What was the value of Jesus when they was hungry?" Come on. He know how to He know how to create, didn't he? Give me the little bit that you got and I'll make sure it won't run out. Hallelujah. And you'll have extra to take up. His value was worth way more than the money. What could that money have done to him that Jesus couldn't have gave him? Think about that. We was talking about that. I said, "What? What could the money have done?" But you know what? That's what the Bible is saying. The love of money, it's not money, but the love of it is the root of all evil. Right? Come on. It was saying the other day bust up families, bust up homes, bust up churches, bust up. It's a destroyer everywhere it go. Right? Come on. But the love of it, right? When you love something, when you love something, it'll control you. Come on. Whether it's whether it's money, whether it's alcohol, drugs, whatever it might be, whatever you love, it's going to control you. Come on. It'll become your master. You believe that? Come on. And you say, "Oh, I ain't demand." But it becomes demanding. It's controlling, right? And you're going to be a servant to it. Come on. But I said, "God, I thank him that I once served sin, but God has made me free." Come on. And God not delivered me, then why should I be bound? Hallelujah. Come on. Serving in the liberty of God. Come on. I don't know about you, but I say yes. There is a physician here. That's the question. Is there Yes, there is a physician here. What are you dealing with? There is somebody that can help you out. Come on. I've been talking to people like, "Oh, you going through that? I got I know somebody that can help with that." And what his phone number is. Hallelujah. Come on. Acts 2:38. Come on. Bless. Come on. Hebrews 13:8. Amen. Come on. Matthew 28:19. Come on. I got we I I know somebody they say I know somebody who Yeah. Come on. They say, "Oh, you No, but what it is Jesus is He is the answer." Come on. He said, "For Abraham was, I am." Come on. He is. You can't lift nothing. You can't lift nothing higher than Jesus. Come on. You might try, but it can't go no higher. He is the standard. Hallelujah. Amen. Come on. And people will find that out one day that Jesus is a standard. Come on. And if they would only put their trust in and and depending on him, he would have took care of all their situations. I believe that. I I I'm living by that. Hallelujah. I'm living by that. God, that's true right now. Hallelujah. Come. Sometimes God got to take your eyes so he can lead you. Hallelujah. Cuz with your eyesight, you looking trying to navigate your own way. But when he takes it, sometimes he got to lead you. God leading. That's what I want. How many want that tonight? Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Amen. I said God God specialize it, don't he? Come on. Amen. He specialize it. I was saying the other day, you know, we was talking about wounds and scars. Sometime you can have a wound that leave a bad scar, right? Amen. And every time you see that scar, it reminds you of the trauma that happened, right? Amen. But I was think I was talking about non. I said it's amazing how he went down there and when God cleans them of leprosy like I says the skin was like new. Hallelujah. Come on. Wouldn't leave not even a scar. And that's what God does even spiritually speaking. Right. See God can heal the deep wounds. Amen. Come on. The deep wounds that nobody I'm saying there's a physician here tonight. God can handle the deep wounds that nobody don't know about. No. Nobody don't know what. No. Nobody don't. But Jesus does. Amen. Come on. That's the truth. We might not know what you going what you're dealing with, but Jesus knows. Come on. All about it. Amen. Come on. And he wants to help you. Come on. Amen. You You didn't know how free you could be. Yes, Lord. And it's already a finished work. It ain't nothing he got to come do. He already done it. Amen. Come on. Amen. You got to have faith not to believe it. Go to Calvary and know that it was for me. Hallelujah. That he died. That he shed his blood. I thank God that he did it for me. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh Jesus. The world don't want to accept it. But I say God, I want to accept what you did. Hallelujah. The church want to live below its privileges, but God, I want to live at my privileges. God, I want to ask, God, and receive from you because you said we can ask and receive. Hallelujah. And you said we have not because we do what? Ask not. Come on. But God, come on. He wants to do. That's why I thank God. I said, "Lord, you know us saying I said the Holy Ghost, he shows us things to come." Come on. That's what he He'll do that now. He'll show you things. He not He ain't just I got the Holy Ghost and I just feel jump shout. Come on. No. He's coming to teach you something. He's coming to reveal some stuff. He's coming to clean your life up. Come on. He's coming to change you from the inside out. Come on. That's what he's coming to do. That inner voice will speak to you. Hallelujah. You'll begin to see the word like you never saw it before because now you're not just reading it as a story or hearing it as intellectual. Come on. But it's something really speaking to you. And God is demonstrating it. Come on. He's showing himself alive and well by many infallible proofs. Hallelujah. Sometimes you can't tell people because they don't believe it. I say God do it for them. Hallelujah. God open their eyes and let them see. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. Come on. Do you want to see tonight? Come on. I said, "We be alone tonight, but there's a physician here." Amen. Come on. There is. I said I said when the king of Samaria was going to the God of Acron, come on. That was an insult. He said, "Is there no God in Israel?" Cuz you wouldn't think so, right? Come on. I say, "Is there no God in Colombia?" Hallelujah. Come on. Is there no God in the in America today? Come on, Jesus. Maybe I know what he's in. He's in living in individual lives and hearts. Amen. He's in his word, but you got to open up your heart and let the word come in. Amen.
