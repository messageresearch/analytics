[45:08] 8. For by grace
[45:11] are you saved through faith,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. It is the
[45:16] gift of God.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Not of works least any man should boast.
[45:22] For we are his workmanship,
[45:26] created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[45:30] which God hath before ordained that we
[45:32] should walk in them. Let church say
[45:35] amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; The lesson that we're going to preach
[45:37] today is well, the workmanship of God.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the book of
[45:42] Revelation, the third chapter.
[45:44] Revelations 3.
[45:46] Then I'm going to let you be seated.
[45:50] Revelations the 3rd chapter and verse
[45:52] 14.
[45:56] And unto the angel
[45:58] of the church of the leadyans,
[46:00] write these things saith thee, amen, the
[46:05] faithful
[46:07] and true witness, the beginning of the
[46:11] creation of God. Let us pray. Father, we
[46:14] thank you today, Lord. We thank you Lord
[46:17] for this love letter called the Bible.
[46:22] Lord, we give your name the praise and
[46:24] the honor and all the glory.
[46:28] Father, because we know that you are
[46:29] Jehovah Shama. You're the God that's
[46:32] present. And you are Jehovah Gyra, the
[46:35] God that provides all of our sacrifice,
[46:39] all of our needs. So, Father, we give
[46:41] this service over into your hands in the
[46:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We thank
[46:47] you. Let's just say amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; You can be seated.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; So, just to
[46:54] kind of get you on the same page of
[46:56] where we are as far as workmanship.
[47:00] Amen. Workmanship.
[47:02] Uh the word workmanship means that which
[47:05] is made, a work of art.
[47:08] It refers to a masterpiece.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. What Paul is saying is that all
[47:15] God's children are his masterpieces.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody looked at somebody and
[47:20] said, "Hello, uh, brother, sister,
[47:22] masterpiece."
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. Come on. Say it with
[47:27] enthusiasm. Hello,
[47:31] brother.
[47:33] Masterpiece.
[47:34] Give the Lord a hack praise. Amen.
[47:37] Hallelujah.
[47:39] That's right. Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; The Hebrew definition of workmanship is
[47:44] um it refers to a new creation
[47:49] &gt;&gt; that God has made in Christ. Emphasizing
[47:53] that believers are the product of God's
[47:56] creative work.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. In the Greek, it's an idea of
[48:03] something brought into being through a
[48:04] creative process.
[48:06] Amen. So in Ephesians the second
[48:09] chapter,
[48:11] it emphasizes that Christians are not
[48:13] just saved by grace
[48:16] but also transformed
[48:19] into something new,
[48:22] &gt;&gt; something
[48:24] uh God actively created and designed.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] Believers are his masterpiece,
[48:36] &gt;&gt; carefully crafted and shaped for a
[48:40] specific purpose.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Let her say amen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let her say amen.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many believe that salvation is
[48:48] all of God?
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that ain't
[48:50] nothing you can do to save yourself?
[48:52] &gt;&gt; And how many know Jesus did it all?
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Jesus
[48:57] did it all.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:01] Thank you, Jesus.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; So, we are the workmanship
[49:07] of the master sculptor.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'll just drop this one. It's on
[49:13] my mind. And God's servant William
[49:15] Brandon preached a lesson on
[49:16] masterpiece.
[49:18] Amen. If you if you follow this message,
[49:20] you know that he came out of Isaiah 53rd
[49:23] chapter. Amen. Where the Lord Jesus was
[49:26] marred and bruised. Uh, Amen. and for
[49:29] our transgressions.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; And he was uh talking about
[49:33] Michelangelo's effort to uh sculpt out
[49:37] Moses. Amen. And how that they didn't
[49:40] have any pictures of Moses. So he had an
[49:42] image in his mind of Moses. Amen. And he
[49:45] worked on that marvel and and rubbed on
[49:48] it and chipped on it and until such time
[49:52] that that statue uh reflected what was
[49:56] in his mind.
[49:58] And when it when it became the reality
[50:01] of what he was thinking in his mind
[50:03] became real in front of him, inspiration
[50:06] struck him and he smoked the statue on
[50:10] his knee.
[50:12] And a piece came off his knee and he
[50:14] cried out, "Speak."
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because what was in his mind now
[50:20] came into reality. And it was so real
[50:23] &gt;&gt; that he decided that that thing ought to
[50:26] be able to speak. Yes.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Let church say
[50:28] &gt;&gt; amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; And when he smoked it,
[50:31] &gt;&gt; that piece came off of that statue.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; God's servant said that's what made it
[50:36] the masterpiece.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; The stroke.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; The piece that fell off of it is what
[50:44] made it the masterpiece.
[50:47] How many know today that we are God's
[50:49] people and God is the great uh I want to
[50:53] call him a sculter but I want to I want
[50:55] to use these terms potter.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Say amen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible in the book of Psalms 139 said
[51:03] I will praise thee for I'm filthully and
[51:06] wonderfully made.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[51:11] knoweth right well. My substance was not
[51:14] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[51:17] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[51:20] parts of the earth. Curiously wrought.
[51:23] That word wrought it it means to be
[51:26] beaten.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Into shape. How many thank God
[51:30] today that that's the way we were
[51:33] &gt;&gt; when we were out there in the world.
[51:35] Amen. Doing our thing. And I don't know
[51:38] about y'all, but I was out there doing
[51:39] my thing. And I know many of y'all was
[51:42] out there doing your thing, too. But how
[51:44] many know that God saw you when you were
[51:47] not perfect?
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many know God saw you when
[51:51] you was out there doing your thing?
[51:53] Glory to God. And and he watched over
[51:56] you. Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he intervened in in your thing
[52:01] that you was doing.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he caused you to come at the
[52:05] appointed time.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And he protected you. Amen. Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; He protected you from all hurt, harm,
[52:14] and danger.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he had something in his
[52:17] mind.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; He was working on you.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He had you on that
[52:24] potter's wheel.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He put you on the potter's
[52:28] wheel.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He turned you and he was shaping
[52:32] you and molding you. Glory to God.
[52:35] Hallelujah. and everything that was
[52:37] going on with you, he had his hands on
[52:40] it.
[52:42] [Applause]
[52:50] &gt;&gt; We are fearfully
[52:52] &gt;&gt; and wonderfully made.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; We were made in secret
[52:58] &gt;&gt; and wrought in the lowest parts of the
[53:01] earth.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I say a lot of times to the
[53:05] people in Aken to kind of get them a
[53:08] little bit uh off their guard. I said
[53:11] Jackson was lower than a worm.
[53:15] Lower than a worm. I share this little
[53:19] story here. I said my wife, bless her
[53:21] heart, um she came from a holiness uh uh
[53:25] tradition. Amen. They they went and when
[53:29] they went to church, they tear it for
[53:30] the Holy Ghost.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then they they prayed through.
[53:35] Amen. I didn't do that. Amen. My daddy
[53:39] was my granddaddy was a preacher,
[53:41] Baptist preacher. Uh I came up to a
[53:43] Baptist tradition and um and I was out
[53:46] there in the world doing my thing. Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to tell you all that I was
[53:52] doing because I don't want you to hold
[53:54] all that dirt on me.
[53:56] Thank you, Jesus.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; But one day I had inspiration to go to
[54:03] church and me and my buddies went to
[54:04] church at Second Nazareth Baptist Church
[54:07] and they decided to go and get baptized.
[54:10] And I decided to go get baptized, too.
[54:14] Amen. I said, "My buddy's getting
[54:15] baptized. I'm going to get baptized,
[54:16] too."
[54:18] But, you know, it wasn't no conversion.
[54:22] It wasn't no conversion. And when I went
[54:24] and got baptized, I went down a dry silt
[54:27] and came up a wet one.
[54:30] Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I know ain't none of y'all done
[54:33] nothing like that. But one thing about
[54:35] it, and I just say this, when I got
[54:38] baptized
[54:40] and the preacher said, "I baptize you in
[54:42] the name of the Father, the Son, and the
[54:44] Holy Ghost."
[54:47] When I got done, came up out the water,
[54:49] it was a question in my mind.
[54:52] What is the name?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; What is the name?
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And that followed me all the time I
[55:03] stayed in that church. And and and I I
[55:06] won't go I won't go long on this. Is
[55:08] that all right? Cuz I'm looking at that
[55:09] clock up there. But
[55:12] [Laughter]
[55:15] &gt;&gt; but Fred, I was sitting I was sitting
[55:17] out in the audience one day when the
[55:19] preacher was preaching and all of a
[55:21] sudden a voice started speaking to me. I
[55:24] didn't know nothing about spiritual
[55:25] things but that voice told me he said,
[55:27] "Look at your preacher up there." He got
[55:29] on his, you know, preacher coat and his
[55:32] turn round collar and long robes and
[55:34] everything. And the voice spoke to me.
[55:36] He said, "If the Roman Catholics get in,
[55:38] y'all will too.
[55:41] That's what the voice said to me. From
[55:43] that time, I left that church. I didn't
[55:46] know why I left that church. And I and
[55:49] and and don't don't don't you know it
[55:51] was no spiritual journey. Um but it was
[55:55] a journey out of hypocrisy
[55:58] into total complete chaos.
[56:03] Amen. Cuz I made it up in my mind I
[56:05] wasn't going to be no hypocrite. I'm
[56:07] going to sit up in there and play like
[56:09] I'm I'm churched and and know in my
[56:12] heart that I'm still in the world.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; So I decided I'm going to go 110% in the
[56:16] world. Randy and I went out in the world
[56:20] and by the grace of God
[56:24] &gt;&gt; God kept me
[56:26] &gt;&gt; from all her harm and danger.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; I was curiously wrought
[56:30] &gt;&gt; in the lowest
[56:33] &gt;&gt; points of this earth. Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you all the things that I
[56:36] did. Uh because that ain't none of y'all
[56:39] business.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; God knows what I did.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; But I I'll say this. I'll say this. I
[56:48] wouldn't go but so far
[56:50] &gt;&gt; because something was there influencing
[56:53] me.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Something was there keeping me from
[56:55] going, you know, all the way
[56:58] &gt;&gt; uh all the way where my other buddies
[57:01] was going.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um,
[57:05] so what did God do? God let me meet that
[57:09] Holy Ghost firebaptized
[57:12] person
[57:13] called Kathleen Bolton.
[57:18] Holy Ghost filled fire baptized.
[57:22] Here I am out in the world. Now you say,
[57:24] was it a spiritual attraction? No. I was
[57:27] out there playing basketball in Latimma
[57:29] Mana.
[57:31] Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. thought I could play too.
[57:38] Playing basketball
[57:40] and all of a sudden something came
[57:42] walking up the street.
[57:50] I said, "My God, who is that?
[57:55] Who is it?" One of my buddies said,
[57:57] "That's Kathleen Bolton." I said, "My
[58:01] God, I need to meet that child.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?"
[58:11] &gt;&gt; One of my buddies, Larry Ball,
[58:15] he said, "I know her. I'll take you and
[58:17] introduce her to you." Oh, by the way,
[58:19] she lived two doors down from you. I
[58:22] said, "What?"
[58:23] went met her. And to fast forward from
[58:28] that time,
[58:30] I was never the same.
[58:37] I was never the same. And I didn't know.
[58:40] I thought it was a physical attraction.
[58:41] It was, but it was more than that.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; It was more than that because um they
[58:47] used to have prayer meetings under
[58:48] underneath the house. Ba, did you ever
[58:50] go to them them prayer meetings
[58:52] underneath the house?
[58:54] Oh, you did? I can. I don't know whether
[58:57] I can believe that, but
[59:02] said underneath the house it was
[59:04] prophesied that she was going to marry a
[59:06] preacher,
[59:09] but she didn't. She married me.
[59:16] Now, I I'm using up a lot of my time to
[59:18] say this, but I'm trying to get it over
[59:19] to you that God works his wonders
[59:24] &gt;&gt; even when you don't know it.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; God works his wonders
[59:34] &gt;&gt; even when you don't know it.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I was getting into.
[59:40] She thought she had married a devil.
[59:47] She actually told me that.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; She told me. She said, "I'd made a
[59:50] mistake. I married a devil and I was
[59:54] supposed to marry a preacher."
[59:58] Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; But God was working.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Say amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many believe that? Say
[1:00:08] amen.
[1:00:10] She didn't know. But God was working on
[1:00:12] me. And and and the fast forward, long
[1:00:14] story short, um the Lord kept me through
[1:00:16] all types of things in the military. I
[1:00:18] was a military officer. I thought it was
[1:00:19] the God's gift to women.
[1:00:24] Don't y'all go out and tell anybody
[1:00:25] listening. Oh, it's on video, is it?
[1:00:32] I thought I was God's gift to women.
[1:00:36] Kathleen there, my blessed faithful
[1:00:40] wife. on my dick like a fool.
[1:00:43] But the Lord kept us together. You know
[1:00:45] how it wasn't on her account cuz she
[1:00:48] would have left me a long time ago.
[1:00:51] But it was her mama.
[1:00:53] Her mama, Miss Pay, she said, "You ain't
[1:00:56] leaving that boy." Because when you
[1:00:59] marry him, you marry him for life.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; So you just suck it up. You stuck with
[1:01:05] him for life. And I thank God for Miss
[1:01:07] Payne because my wife stuck with me
[1:01:10] through thick and thin.
[1:01:13] Come on, give God praise. Come on, give
[1:01:16] God praise.
[1:01:18] Amen. And she was praying for me. I knew
[1:01:21] she was praying for me. And then at the
[1:01:23] appointed time, God called me. Amen. and
[1:01:27] and and and you know sometimes things
[1:01:29] happen in your life where you don't know
[1:01:33] why they happening but what it is God's
[1:01:35] got you on that potter's wheel.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's working on you.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's he's he's molding and shaping
[1:01:43] you through the events that take place
[1:01:45] in your life.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And what event happened in my life was
[1:01:49] that I was up in Michigan, Midland,
[1:01:51] Michigan. My daddy died.
[1:01:54] My rock died. Amen. And I'm on a plane
[1:01:58] going home to his funeral.
[1:02:01] And that same voice that spoke to me in
[1:02:04] that Baptist church, it spoke to me. And
[1:02:07] it said
[1:02:08] even before I decided to to go home, it
[1:02:12] said, "Go home, my son, and help. Go
[1:02:15] home and help." I thought, for Simmons,
[1:02:19] I thought I was um pretty smart fell. I
[1:02:22] thought I was supposed to go home and
[1:02:23] become a lawyer. Amen. And I thought I
[1:02:25] was supposed to go home and call a
[1:02:26] lawyer. But that voice spoke to me and
[1:02:30] told me to go home in hell. And what did
[1:02:32] he do? As I was down there by that
[1:02:35] casket crying my hearts out about losing
[1:02:38] my daddy, he spoke to me again. And what
[1:02:42] did he say? I am your daddy now. How
[1:02:45] many thank God today for the voice of
[1:02:47] God. Oh, somebody give him praise. The
[1:02:51] Lord spoke to me and said, I am your
[1:02:53] daddy.
[1:02:54] I thank God for that.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; But
[1:03:00] it it took something
[1:03:04] it took a visitation of the spirit of
[1:03:06] God to uh to really work on me. And how
[1:03:10] did that happen? It happened uh through
[1:03:14] God supernaturally giving me a job in in
[1:03:16] South Carolina. And the first person I
[1:03:18] saw was a Holy Ghost filled firebaptized
[1:03:22] preacher by the name of Charles
[1:03:25] Anderson.
[1:03:26] Amen. He walked in Caroline Eastman come
[1:03:28] in with his Bible in his arm. He wasn't
[1:03:32] ashamed of the gospel at all.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when I came in, he took me on
[1:03:37] as a project. Amen. I wasn't too stirred
[1:03:40] about no Bible study in my house.
[1:03:44] I really wasn't. I had a pool table in
[1:03:46] my basement and I had my big buddies
[1:03:48] coming over. We drink beer and shoot
[1:03:49] pool.
[1:03:52] Brother Anderson said, "I want I want I
[1:03:53] want to come talk to you." That brother
[1:03:56] came in the station wagon with the pool
[1:03:58] pit in the back and brought it and set
[1:04:01] it up in my living room and we had
[1:04:03] church in the house.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; What was going on? God
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; was working.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; His mysterious work.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And while I was in the lowest
[1:04:14] parts of the earth,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; he had me on that potter's wheel. Give
[1:04:19] him praise today. Amen. Oh, somebody
[1:04:21] give him praise. Somebody say, "Thank
[1:04:23] you, Lord."
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were dwelling in the Lord's
[1:04:27] possible direction. We were sinners in
[1:04:29] the flesh and needed to be broken.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; We needed to be broken. We needed our
[1:04:37] eyes enlightened
[1:04:39] to the anointing that was dealing with
[1:04:42] us. Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it wasn't for the grace of God,
[1:04:45] I would have went on like that and
[1:04:47] wasted my whole life.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; But God,
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; but God,
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; somebody say, "But God,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; who's rich in mercy."
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Saw it fit to reveal himself to
[1:05:00] me.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; And how many thank God today that God
[1:05:04] saw it fit to reveal himself to you.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Amen.
[1:05:10] Somebody give me praise today. Amen.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; And when he reveals himself to you,
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; he puts you on that partner's will.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Spins that will and begin to shape and
[1:05:25] mold you.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; What does he do? He allows the
[1:05:29] experiences in your life to mold
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; to shape you.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Thank you for the
[1:05:38] trials."
[1:05:39] Somebody say, "Thank you, Lord, for the
[1:05:41] trials that you let me go through."
[1:05:43] Hallelujah. You did not leave me. You
[1:05:46] did not forsake me. You were with me all
[1:05:50] the while. Oh, somebody shout
[1:05:52] hallelujah. Come on, shout praise the
[1:05:55] Lord. You were there all the while.
[1:06:02] [Applause]
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Our lives needed to be broke. Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah said, "Rise and let's go down
[1:06:14] to the potter's house."
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; And there I will cause thee to hear my
[1:06:19] words.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; And then I went down to the potter's
[1:06:22] house. And behold, he wrought a work on
[1:06:24] the wheels,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and the vessel that he made of clay was
[1:06:28] marred in his hand. Yeah. Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; What did he do
[1:06:35] when he had us in our in his hands?
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And and we weren't living up to
[1:06:41] standards.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did he kick us aside?
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Did he throw us aside and just discard
[1:06:50] us?
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; No. He what he did was
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; he broke it and then he put it back on
[1:06:58] the wheel
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; to make it another vessel.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; How many thank God today that God rich
[1:07:05] in mercy he broke you but he put you
[1:07:08] back on the wheel. How many thank God
[1:07:10] for that today? Come on. How many thank
[1:07:12] God today?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody say please
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; say it with me. Please
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; be patient with me.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Be patient with me.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; God. God
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; is not through with me yet.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; He is.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; But when God
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; But when God
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; get through with me,
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; with me,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come forth
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; like pure gold.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; How many feel that way today?
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many feel that way today?
[1:07:40] Come on. How many really believe that
[1:07:42] that's your journey in life? that God is
[1:07:46] going to put you on the part of his
[1:07:48] will, mold you and shape you.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; But after he gets you into that image
[1:07:53] that he wants to see,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; he puts you in the fire.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He throws you in the fire.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's something else
[1:08:05] needs to be purified
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; out of your life.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; So he allows you to go through a fiery
[1:08:12] trial.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when the potter allows us to
[1:08:26] go through the trials, sometimes we get
[1:08:28] a little bit discouraged.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank that he done left us, but
[1:08:33] you don't realize that the potter got
[1:08:35] his eyes on you. Glory to God. He knows
[1:08:40] what he got in store for you.
[1:08:44] I
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I'm Randy back there. Stand up, Randy.
[1:08:47] Stand up, Randy.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Don't he look like a big healthy man.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; A big healthy man.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; But how many know what about a year ago,
[1:08:59] Randy? It's about a year ago.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Seven months ago, Randy got shot
[1:09:06] with a 45.
[1:09:08] And I got I got a 45 bullet back there.
[1:09:11] I thought I was going to bring out and
[1:09:12] let you look at is a big bullet.
[1:09:16] Shot eight times
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; with a 45.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Randy shouldn't be standing there.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Randy should not be standing there.
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; But God,
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; rich in mercy,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; had him on the pot as well. Amen. And
[1:09:40] had somebody praying for him. And God
[1:09:43] performed miracle upon miracle upon
[1:09:45] miracle upon miracle upon him. And now
[1:09:48] he's standing there as a testimony that
[1:09:51] God
[1:09:53] the master potter is able to keep us.
[1:10:00] Glory to God. God is able.
[1:10:05] You can be seated around. Give God
[1:10:07] praise today. Amen.
[1:10:09] Give God praise today. Amen.
[1:10:12] Give him praise today.
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; He's the potter.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; We're the clay.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; You know, like the potter
[1:10:30] Jeremiah was going down the pot to be
[1:10:32] broke up.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me say this.
[1:10:37] If you don't allow yourself to get
[1:10:39] broken,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; you never can be made over.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; A lot of time folk carrying all this
[1:10:47] pride and and all of this made us and
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; and all these thoughts.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; God want to break you.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; But God is not breaking you to destroy
[1:11:00] you.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; I'm reminded something God's servant
[1:11:03] said. It's about this little lamb.
[1:11:06] Amen. He's a shepherd. And this little
[1:11:09] lamb wouldn't pay no attention to what
[1:11:11] he had to say to him. So what did he do?
[1:11:15] He took the little lamb and broke both
[1:11:17] his legs.
[1:11:19] You said, "That's a that's a mean
[1:11:20] shepherd, isn't it? That would break the
[1:11:23] lamb's legs."
[1:11:25] Amen. That's a mean shepherd, isn't it?
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; But he knew what he was going to do.
[1:11:33] Somebody asked him, "Why did you do
[1:11:35] that? Why'd you break the lamb's legs?
[1:11:38] He said, "Because I want to give it
[1:11:40] special attention.
[1:11:43] I'm going to put it on my shoulders and
[1:11:46] I'm going to uh uh take care of it."
[1:11:50] Amen. I'm going to give it special
[1:11:52] attention so that when it gets well, it
[1:11:56] will know my love better than when it
[1:11:59] did when it was out there cutting a
[1:12:00] fool.
[1:12:01] How many thank the Lord today that
[1:12:03] that's what God does with us. Amen. When
[1:12:06] we act like we know it all,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; act like we can't be taught.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; God, let something break you.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that he can give you special
[1:12:16] attention.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; So that he can show you his love.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody give him praise before I
[1:12:22] get there.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; But it was a lady uh before I get there.
[1:12:27] But it was a lady uh was a relative of
[1:12:31] brother singingly and sister singing
[1:12:33] actually it's is poti was uh s singly
[1:12:37] sister and I don't know what stage of
[1:12:39] cancer she had it might have been what
[1:12:43] is the fourth stage of cancer is that
[1:12:45] the large is that the most critical
[1:12:48] stage
[1:12:49] well she was in the hospital and and uh
[1:12:53] doctor was saying ain't nothing more
[1:12:54] they could do for her and they were
[1:12:56] basically giving given up on her. And um
[1:13:01] make a long story short,
[1:13:03] uh succinctly went to the hospital and
[1:13:05] and when she went there, she was in bad
[1:13:07] shape. You know how cancer patients had
[1:13:10] all that pain and they groaning and and
[1:13:13] moaning and Amen. And it's almost like
[1:13:17] it's a little lost cause.
[1:13:21] She quietly went in the room behind her
[1:13:26] and while she was groaning, she just
[1:13:29] called her name
[1:13:31] Poti.
[1:13:33] And then all of a sudden, Poti said,
[1:13:35] "Tiny."
[1:13:37] She stopped groaning and moaning and she
[1:13:39] said, "Tiny."
[1:13:41] Things begin to change.
[1:13:44] They came to church that Sunday and said
[1:13:47] pray for Poti because the cancer done
[1:13:51] took over and you know about taken out.
[1:13:56] We had prayer at the front of the church
[1:14:00] and um that was over a week ago.
[1:14:05] The testimony that we got I got got it
[1:14:10] Thursday night of this week. I I guess
[1:14:12] that was this Thursday gone that the
[1:14:15] doctors checked out Poti
[1:14:18] and they declared her cancer free.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; What
[1:14:31] the potter
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; the potter
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; is allowing us to go through the fire.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. to show
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; that he's in control.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Lord, have your way in my
[1:14:48] life."
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Have your way, Jesus.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; You are the potter.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; We're the claim.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody say yes Lord.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; We read Revelation the 3rd chapter in
[1:15:19] verse 14
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; and it reads and unto the angel of the
[1:15:23] church of the le of sins. Write these
[1:15:25] things sayaith the amen. Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; The faithful and true witness,
[1:15:30] the beginning of the creation of God.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's who the Lord Jesus say. He is the
[1:15:38] beginning
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; of the creation
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; But those words don't mean exactly as
[1:15:46] they sound.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You say the words don't mean what it
[1:15:49] sound. No, just taking them the way they
[1:15:52] sound. It make people think or get the
[1:15:56] idea that Jesus was the first creation
[1:15:58] of God, making him lower than Godhead.
[1:16:02] Then this first creation created all the
[1:16:05] rest of the universe and whatsoever it
[1:16:08] contains. But that's not right.
[1:16:12] That doesn't line up with the rest of
[1:16:13] the Bible
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; because the words
[1:16:19] really mean this. He is the beginner or
[1:16:24] the author of the creation of God. Come
[1:16:28] on. How many How many understand what
[1:16:29] I'm saying? Say amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; He's the author of the creation of God.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's say amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:41] We know that in John 1:3 the Bible says
[1:16:44] all things were made by him.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And without him was any not anything
[1:16:51] made that was made.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; He's the one that was said in Genesis
[1:16:55] 1:1, in the beginning God created the
[1:16:58] heaven and earth.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It says in Exodus 2011, for in six days
[1:17:03] the Lord made heaven and earth and the
[1:17:05] sea and all that in them is and rested
[1:17:07] the seventh day. Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt that our Lord Jesus is
[1:17:11] the creator.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; And he was the creator of a finished
[1:17:16] physical creation.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Let us say amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; So we can see by these words, what these
[1:17:24] words mean to have any other
[1:17:26] interpretation would mean that God
[1:17:28] created God. And how can God be created
[1:17:32] when himself he is the creator?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:37] Now I'm going I'm going to bring it home
[1:17:39] now.
[1:17:41] I'm going to bring it home. So now in
[1:17:45] our day,
[1:17:47] in the worst church age there is,
[1:17:51] a church age that he rebuked and said
[1:17:54] that it was blind, naked,
[1:17:58] miserable,
[1:18:00] and don't even know it. That's right.
[1:18:03] in the final
[1:18:06] uh closing church age.
[1:18:11] He made that statement standing in the
[1:18:14] midst of the church. He stands there
[1:18:16] revealing himself
[1:18:19] as the author
[1:18:21] of the creation
[1:18:24] of God
[1:18:26] in the darkest hour
[1:18:29] that the world will see.
[1:18:33] Now I got your attention.
[1:18:36] So
[1:18:38] in this dark hour,
[1:18:42] he's declaring
[1:18:45] that he's creating something
[1:18:48] in this dark hour.
[1:18:53] This is a new creation.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Let say amen.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; It's different from the original
[1:19:02] creation.
[1:19:04] The Bible in 2 Corinthians the 5th
[1:19:06] chapter and verse 17 says, "Therefore,
[1:19:07] if any man be in Christ, he is a new
[1:19:12] creation." Let her say, "Amen."
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Old things have what? Passed away.
[1:19:18] Behold, what? All things have become
[1:19:22] new.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; How many in here today are in Christ
[1:19:25] Jesus?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many of today are in the
[1:19:29] revealed word for your day?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody shout hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; So what does it is that new creation is
[1:19:37] inside of you.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Any man be in Christ, he's a new
[1:19:46] creation.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Old things have what?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Passed away. Behold what?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; All things are become new.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you still holding on to some of
[1:19:59] them old things, you need to get in
[1:20:00] Christ. If you still holding on to
[1:20:02] temper, you need to get in Christ.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; If you still holding on to selfishness,
[1:20:07] you need to get in Christ
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; because all those old things pass away.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; When you're in the revelation of Jesus
[1:20:15] Christ.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the creative power of God
[1:20:19] is working on you.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody give him praise today. Amen.
[1:20:24] Oh, somebody give him praise. Oh,
[1:20:26] somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:20:28] Thank you, Jesus. Oh my God. This is
[1:20:32] another creation.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; This has to do with the church.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; A special designation of himself.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; He is the creator of that church.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom is creating
[1:20:47] himself a bride.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that I can say that I'm
[1:20:54] one of them.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody say, somebody say it with
[1:20:57] me. I'm so glad. I'm glad
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I can say
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; I can say
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a minute.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. And I I I I know
[1:21:15] that God's people
[1:21:18] um
[1:21:20] haven't been brought into
[1:21:23] a channel where they understand the
[1:21:25] grace that God has poured out upon us in
[1:21:28] this hour.
[1:21:31] We understand intellectually,
[1:21:34] but have it been quickened to us on who
[1:21:39] we really are?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] When those seals was breaking
[1:21:46] and that seven churches messenger was
[1:21:48] addressing the church, he said, "I don't
[1:21:51] call you no more church.
[1:21:54] I call you bride."
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because only the bride is going to
[1:22:01] know the deep secrets
[1:22:04] of the father. Only those whose names
[1:22:09] were in the book of life from the
[1:22:11] foundation of the world are going to
[1:22:13] have ears to hear what the spirit is
[1:22:16] saying in this day. And I don't know
[1:22:18] about you today, but I thank God that I
[1:22:20] can say that I'm one of them.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And by having ears to hear, by having
[1:22:25] ears to hear, by having ears to hear
[1:22:28] that word, you have passed from death
[1:22:32] unto life.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It shows that eternal life is
[1:22:36] inside of your body.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you today, but
[1:22:39] I'm getting old. Amen. I I I'll be 73 my
[1:22:43] birthday. And I thank God to know that I
[1:22:45] got that treasure of eternal life in my
[1:22:49] body. Amen. Oh, somebody shout
[1:22:51] hallelujah. Somebody shout praise the
[1:22:54] Lord. Hallelujah. I don't have to be
[1:22:57] afraid of death. Death, where is your
[1:22:59] strength? Grave, where is your victory?
[1:23:02] Thanks be to God that's given me the
[1:23:05] victory even in my Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:23:07] Christ.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he has appeared.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He has appeared
[1:23:20] [Applause]
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; in our day.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; You know, I thought, brother Simmons, I
[1:23:32] was going to preach on the the pool of
[1:23:34] Calvary.
[1:23:36] How many know the Lord Jesus said in St.
[1:23:38] John the 12th chapter,
[1:23:40] he said this? He said, "If I be lifted
[1:23:45] up,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I will draw all men unto myself, unto
[1:23:53] me." What was he lifted up at? At the
[1:23:56] cross.
[1:23:58] At the cross is where he was lifted up.
[1:24:00] So what came out of the cross? What came
[1:24:03] out of the cross is a pull
[1:24:06] an attraction.
[1:24:08] Amen. To draw the predestinated
[1:24:11] seed to himself.
[1:24:14] Let us say amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] At first Paul healing ministry
[1:24:27] healed many. But did that change their
[1:24:30] hearts? No. Did not change the hearts.
[1:24:36] God manifested that first pull in the in
[1:24:38] the service of the ministry all over the
[1:24:40] world.
[1:24:42] Multitudes of people were healed. But
[1:24:45] did that change their hearts?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; No. Second pull came
[1:24:50] discernment.
[1:24:52] Amen. Showing
[1:24:54] uh things that happened in their lives
[1:24:56] that's hindering them from moving on
[1:24:58] with God. Amen. That happened multitudes
[1:25:02] of times. Did that change the heart? No.
[1:25:07] Actually, it caused doors to close on
[1:25:09] them.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that Holy Ghost, that
[1:25:11] light would come into the room and begin
[1:25:14] to show things. Amen. Not only did it
[1:25:17] show hindrance of healing, but it showed
[1:25:19] also demonic spirits that's working in
[1:25:22] the religious realm.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; So what did it do? It caused doors to
[1:25:27] close on them. But the third pull, let's
[1:25:31] just say the third pull.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's changing the hearts.
[1:25:39] That's what's changing the heart. That's
[1:25:42] what's converting the hearts. That's
[1:25:43] what's cleansing the heart. That's
[1:25:45] what's producing a bride
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; The revealing of the mystery secrets of
[1:25:53] God.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; It's what's changing the hearts.
[1:25:59] How many thank God today that you are
[1:26:02] the recipients of that third pull?
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him praise today, man. Come on,
[1:26:07] give him praise. Somebody give him
[1:26:09] praise.
[1:26:11] Somebody say, "Thank you, Jesus."
[1:26:14] Another creation. And that's what he's
[1:26:15] doing.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; By revealing himself in those seals,
[1:26:21] what is it doing? It's it's it's causing
[1:26:24] a pull to pull us not
[1:26:28] to the holy place,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; but pulling us behind the veil.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; In the presence of Shakana glory.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; In the presence of that light. In the
[1:26:39] presence of that pillar of fire that
[1:26:41] came into his ministry. That's where the
[1:26:44] bride is abiding.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Underneath the shadows of his wings.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Underneath the anointing that breaks
[1:26:52] every yoke.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Underneath the anointing that raises the
[1:26:55] dead.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Underneath the anointing that heals the
[1:26:59] sick. Underneath the anointing that
[1:27:01] changes the seat of the affections of
[1:27:03] our heart. Why? It's the creative power
[1:27:06] of God.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Let church say hallelujah.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God created the universe by
[1:27:12] his spoken word.
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He created the universe by his spoken
[1:27:21] word.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; And now in this day, he's creating a new
[1:27:28] creation of people
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; by his spoken word.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:36] And remember in Genesis 1 when he got
[1:27:39] done creating the uh original creation,
[1:27:42] he made this statement. Not only is this
[1:27:45] good, but it's very good.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; How many thank God today that God is
[1:27:50] speaking the same thing in our day
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; for those have received this revealed
[1:27:56] word and really received it in their
[1:27:57] hearts. What is he saying? He's the
[1:28:01] author of a new creation of people. And
[1:28:04] what is he saying about them? They're
[1:28:06] not only good, but they are very good.
[1:28:11] Oh, reach over to somebody and say,
[1:28:13] "Hello, new creation."
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say it like with
[1:28:17] authority. Hello, new creation.

[1:28:40] the earth that can manifest the true
[1:28:42] sons and daughters of God.

[1:43:35] I'm a praying man.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; I love to pray.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; I prayed so hard and when I went back,
[1:43:44] they said, "You ain't got to have no
[1:43:46] surgery."
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:51] Say, "You ain't got to have it."

[1:44:04] 37 lbs rapidly. And folks be to laugh at
[1:44:10] me, tease me. After I'm going to sit
[1:44:13] down. After I preached my wife funeral,
[1:44:15] my family turned their backs on me.
[1:44:19] Some of them didn't even come to the
[1:44:20] funeral. They turned on me. I don't have
[1:44:24] no kids. I'm down in here by myself. I'm
[1:44:26] from Baltimore. I don't have no family
[1:44:28] here. And God healed my body. They was
[1:44:32] hoping that I die.
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; They was hoping that I die because
[1:44:40] holiness is right. Kill you. My mama, my
[1:44:43] daddy. You hell bound. You hell bound.
[1:44:45] You in sin. You need to come out. The
[1:44:47] preacher preached it. Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I'mma go to my seat. They said, "You
[1:44:53] going to need surgery done, Mr. McCrae."
[1:44:55] I got down on my knees. The Bible said,
[1:44:57] "This poor man cried."
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; He was talking about the broken spirit.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; He wasn't talking about the money that
[1:45:04] he had a few bucks.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "This poor man cried
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; and the Lord heard him."
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I want to let you know
[1:45:16] preacher, the Lord heard me.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Heard my cry. Oh, sister. I had five. I

[1:45:24] one. I got five left. If I got a card
[1:45:28] other than my sister Da Lo Ricky, they
[1:45:31] were there for me.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; But God, when nobody else is there for
[1:45:35] you, God is with you.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bible say God is our refuge, our
[1:45:42] strength, a very present help in
[1:45:45] trouble.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I didn't have nobody to call on but the
[1:45:49] Lord.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I had retinal cancer while I was
[1:45:54] preaching my wife
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; and hope that I died. After I prayed so
[1:46:00] hard and I the Lord healed my body.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; They said they wanted to do radiation.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; They done radiation. They said we going
[1:46:11] to have to do chemo and we going to have
[1:46:13] to put you on some bags. I am not
[1:46:16] Frankenstein.
[1:46:18] I might look a little funny, but I
[1:46:23] pray
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; and I pray and the Lord heal my body.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; I don't want no king. He said, "Well,
[1:46:33] you got to have it." I peed like
[1:46:36] something big.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "I ain't born in this body."
[1:46:41] Holy Ghost in my body.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything in there that you don't
[1:46:46] find, God will find.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; I feel my brother.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; My body.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; I didn't do no chemo at all. I said,
[1:47:00] "Keep me. I don't want it.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; You know what God done after smoking all
[1:47:07] the weed I smoke? I wish I I wish I had
[1:47:10] a witness. After running all the

[1:47:59] there in Lexington. I prayed so that
[1:48:03] every time I went in there, I gained
[1:48:04] weight. I started feeling sorry for
[1:48:07] other cancer patients. I went in there
[1:48:10] in the waiting room. I started singing
[1:48:12] about how sweet I
