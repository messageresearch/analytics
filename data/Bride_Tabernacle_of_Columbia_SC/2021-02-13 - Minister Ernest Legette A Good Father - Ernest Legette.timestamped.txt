[27:53] in the name of jesus christ amen
[27:57] [Music]
[27:59] amen we want to look at the book of
[28:00] hebrews by god's grace
[28:02] hebrews 12.
[28:18] hebrews 12 and we'll begin at the first
[28:20] verse
[28:23] [Music]
[28:27] you gotta say man
[28:31] i gotta get it myself
[28:41] hebrews 12 and one it reads
[28:44] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[28:48] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[28:50] let us lay aside every weight
[28:52] and the sin which does easily so easily
[28:55] beset us
[28:57] and let us run with patience the race
[28:59] that is set before us you may be seated
[29:05] he said run with patience the race that
[29:07] set before you
[29:09] you know i want to read a little further
[29:12] down
[29:13] says looking unto jesus the author and
[29:16] the finisher of our faith
[29:18] who for the joy that was set before him
[29:20] endured the cross
[29:21] despising the shame and is set down at
[29:24] the right hand of the throne of
[29:26] god for consider him that endure such
[29:28] condition of sinners against himself
[29:30] lest ye be weary and feign in your minds
[29:34] ye have not resisted unto blood striving
[29:37] against sin
[29:38] and ye have forgotten exhortation which
[29:41] speaketh unto you as
[29:42] to children my son despise not the
[29:46] chastening of the lord
[29:48] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[29:51] for whom the lord love he chasteneth and
[29:53] discourages every son
[29:55] whom he receiveth if you endure
[29:57] chastening
[29:58] god deals with you with with you as with
[30:01] sons
[30:02] for for what son is the whom the father
[30:06] chasing is not
[30:08] but if you be without chastisement
[30:11] where of all are partakers then ye are
[30:14] what
[30:16] and not sons amen
[30:19] furthermore we have had our we have had
[30:22] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[30:26] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[30:29] much more
[30:30] rather be in the subjection unto the
[30:32] father of spirits
[30:33] and live for for their for they verily
[30:38] for a few days chastened us for their
[30:41] own pleasure
[30:42] but he for our prophet that we might be
[30:44] partakers of his holiness
[30:46] now the chaz chastening from the present
[30:50] for the present seemed present seemed to
[30:54] be joyous
[30:55] no chase now no chastening from the
[30:57] presence seemed to be joyous
[30:58] but grievous nevertheless afterward it
[31:01] yielded
[31:02] the peaceable fruit of righteousness
[31:04] unto them which are exercised
[31:07] by thereby wherefore lift up the hands
[31:10] which
[31:11] hang down and the feeble knees make
[31:13] straight to pass for your feet
[31:15] lest that which is lame be turned out of
[31:18] the way
[31:19] but let it rather be healed
[31:23] amen tonight by god's grace i just want
[31:26] to minister to you
[31:27] for a short moment and i entitled it
[31:30] what a good father a good father
[31:34] and what it takes to grow amen
[31:37] a good father and what it takes to grow
[31:41] you know we can look at many things in
[31:43] the scripture
[31:45] i like how he says that here you know
[31:48] let us run with patience
[31:49] the race that is set before you i know a
[31:52] lot of times we want everything quick
[31:53] fast we want to hurry up and get done
[31:56] but he says i want you to run this race
[31:57] with patience
[31:59] i want you to take your time come on
[32:01] it's going to be a lot of things
[32:03] you know in a way a lot of things coming
[32:06] because
[32:07] god is no matter what's taking place in
[32:10] our lives
[32:11] you know we got to come to the to the
[32:13] understanding
[32:14] that god is doing something he's working
[32:17] something out
[32:18] i told my my grandmother a while back i
[32:21] said
[32:21] you know she was having her little time
[32:24] faced with some things and i said you
[32:26] know you might be 80 something years old
[32:29] but
[32:29] god ain't done with you yet i say your
[32:32] work ain't finished
[32:33] because if your work was finished then
[32:35] you would have no need to you know
[32:37] be here but the lord got you here
[32:38] because your work ain't finished
[32:40] so sometimes we we
[32:43] want to hurry up the race as we say it
[32:46] but
[32:46] you know he says with patience i want
[32:49] you to take this race
[32:51] and whatever god the things that that
[32:54] come
[32:54] a lot of times situations don't have to
[32:57] be as bad as
[32:58] as what they are in our life it's just
[33:01] how we look at those situations
[33:03] they don't even have to be that bad but
[33:07] we have to change i believe that
[33:09] sometimes
[33:10] in the way we we're thinking the way
[33:12] we're looking at it and that
[33:14] no matter what comes my way i'm gonna
[33:16] i'm gonna get something out of it
[33:18] i'm gonna find i'm gonna find growth
[33:21] in what i'm going through i'm gonna find
[33:24] i'm gonna find i'm gonna gain
[33:25] something and what the lord has taken me
[33:27] through so
[33:28] where i'm where i'm at right now i'm not
[33:31] worried about where i'm at right now
[33:33] like to say
[33:34] i know where i'm at i'm not worried
[33:35] about it come on
[33:37] and i was praying last night and i said
[33:39] you know it comes
[33:40] some things happen in our life but the
[33:42] lord he don't show us every road
[33:44] that's before us he don't show us the
[33:47] way
[33:48] i said sometimes look like we're moving
[33:51] we don't know where we at we don't know
[33:52] i mean which road to take
[33:54] god don't show us every road but i
[33:57] i was praying to myself and it came to
[33:59] me that when the lord
[34:01] put you at a certain place your
[34:04] testimony will
[34:05] will it always be i'll bless the lord
[34:09] he said bless the lord at all times his
[34:12] praise shall what
[34:13] continually be in my mouth so i i was
[34:16] praying i could see myself
[34:18] you know it's look like you had a place
[34:20] and you don't know the direction
[34:23] where you got to go but i said in that
[34:25] place
[34:26] i'm still gonna bless the lord i'm gonna
[34:28] still trust you god
[34:30] because just as a sheep need a shepherd
[34:32] lord you are my shepherd
[34:34] i'm not leading myself i want you to
[34:36] leave me
[34:38] and wherever you lead me i'll follow
[34:40] whatever situation you know you find
[34:42] yourself
[34:43] in like i said lord i'm gonna grow out
[34:45] of this situation
[34:46] i'm gonna find i'm gonna find what are
[34:48] you what do you want me to learn in this
[34:50] place
[34:51] what are you trying to teach me because
[34:52] remember the holy ghost is the teacher
[34:54] he come to teach you all things you know
[34:56] just as
[34:57] i always say you had to learn when you
[35:00] were born
[35:01] how to operate in this world you had to
[35:03] learn how to walk
[35:04] you had to learn how to hold things you
[35:06] had to learn how to
[35:07] even some simple things that we take for
[35:10] granted
[35:10] you take your spoon and you just pick up
[35:12] and eat but you one day had to learn how
[35:14] to do that
[35:15] you had to learn how to use a fork you
[35:17] had to learn certain things in the
[35:19] natural life
[35:20] and it was most of the time taught by
[35:23] our parents
[35:24] or sometimes you had older siblings or
[35:25] things or some things you just knew
[35:27] how to do by instinct but just as you we
[35:30] had to learn
[35:31] how to function how to operate what was
[35:34] what in the natural realm
[35:36] the same way the holy ghost has to teach
[35:38] us on the spiritual side
[35:40] how to operate that why you say run this
[35:42] race with patience being born again
[35:45] you didn't come out you don't come out
[35:46] the womb running but you got to learn
[35:49] you learn
[35:49] you crawl you know you have to learn how
[35:51] to crawl
[35:53] you imagine that as a baby babies have
[35:56] to learn how to crawl
[35:57] they don't even know how to crawl they
[35:59] have to learn how to crawl then they
[36:00] have to learn how to sit up
[36:02] they have to learn you know there's
[36:04] certain things that they have to learn
[36:05] they
[36:06] their muscles got to get stronger for
[36:08] them to do things come on
[36:09] it's and what it is they they growing
[36:11] into that place
[36:13] and just as those things after a while
[36:15] you take it for granted but
[36:16] you were in the learning process one day
[36:18] you had to learn those things
[36:20] then as time go on you learn a lot of
[36:23] other key things in life some things
[36:25] only come with
[36:25] age and time you want to be there but
[36:28] you got to learn
[36:30] you have to learn those things but i
[36:33] said all that in the natural
[36:34] because we're looking at it from a
[36:35] spiritual sense no
[36:37] like i said the holy ghost is the
[36:39] teacher he come to teach you all things
[36:41] he wants to teach you how to operate in
[36:43] the realm of faith
[36:44] he wants to teach you how to excel with
[36:48] nothing
[36:48] come on how to make like they say how
[36:51] you make something out of nothing he
[36:53] want to teach you that
[36:54] and how are you going to do that by
[36:56] faith he want to teach you how to walk
[36:58] on water come on
[36:59] he says you say to the mountain be thou
[37:01] remover to be cast to
[37:03] see god want to teach you how to operate
[37:05] in realms that you don't know nothing
[37:07] about come on
[37:08] but it's all in the learning process how
[37:10] many believe that tonight
[37:12] so he says that you know a good father
[37:15] and what it takes to grow
[37:16] i said it's something god we know he he
[37:20] has
[37:20] attributes that he want he wanted to
[37:22] express
[37:23] from the beginning of time he had things
[37:26] in him
[37:26] that he wanted to express to us to show
[37:29] him to show us who he who he
[37:31] is and that you know a lot of times you
[37:34] look for something
[37:35] people are looking for things but he is
[37:38] what you're looking for
[37:39] he's got what you're looking for how
[37:41] many believe that
[37:43] so we find i says that you know he's got
[37:46] attributes and
[37:47] one of the things on an attribute i want
[37:49] to
[37:50] dwell on tonight by god's grace says he
[37:53] is a father
[37:55] not only is he a father but he's a good
[37:57] father
[37:58] come on many times we forget that part
[38:01] about it
[38:01] we see him as being god the master come
[38:04] on but but
[38:05] he's a father he wants to he and he
[38:07] wants to show you
[38:09] you know uh what a what a good father is
[38:13] you know a lot of times uh we as those
[38:16] that have children
[38:17] can we we consider ourselves to be
[38:19] parents fathers and stuff but
[38:21] he he wants to show us what a good
[38:23] father is
[38:24] he wants to you know and that's god god
[38:27] god cares about that
[38:29] yo yo yo daily principles in life come
[38:32] on
[38:32] he just don't want you just to be any
[38:34] kind of way but god wants to work on you
[38:37] with daily principles god wants to work
[38:39] on you from every wit
[38:41] to be or to become what he desired or
[38:45] what he see in his
[38:46] mind of you i thank the lord tonight
[38:49] but i said i want to deal with that
[38:50] sometimes we forget that
[38:52] that that god is is a father but you
[38:55] know i says that you know looking here
[38:57] he talks about how he says in the ninth
[39:01] verse
[39:02] he says furthermore we have had fathers
[39:05] of our flesh
[39:06] which corrected us and we gave them
[39:08] reverence
[39:09] shall we not much more be under
[39:11] subjection
[39:12] to the father of spirits a lot of times
[39:16] you know we have to uh i believe
[39:19] examine how we treating god you say
[39:23] okay how you treat god a lot of times
[39:25] you look at how you're dealing with the
[39:27] ministry
[39:28] remember the man of god is he's god's
[39:30] mouthpiece
[39:31] he's god gives him a word he's using
[39:34] that man to speak through you
[39:36] so it's not that that man is trying to
[39:39] establish
[39:40] dominance over you in that way but what
[39:42] it is god is delivering to you
[39:45] what he desires what he wants
[39:48] uh with the word so we we see that
[39:51] you know it we like he said you give
[39:53] your natural
[39:55] father's reverence how much more when
[39:57] they corrected you he dealt with that
[39:59] correction
[40:00] when they corrected you you gave them
[40:02] reverence come on
[40:04] you try to a good child try to
[40:07] please their parent try to please their
[40:10] father or whatever dude to do what
[40:12] whatever they think will be pleasing in
[40:13] sight so
[40:15] to do that he said how much more are not
[40:17] we to have reverence for the father of
[40:19] all spirits
[40:21] for the how much more if you want to
[40:23] please your natural parents would you
[40:25] want to please god just so much more
[40:27] god is god is so good i said lord
[40:31] that's what it is we we got to start i
[40:33] believe that
[40:34] by the grace of god uh looking at
[40:37] looking at it
[40:38] in a little different from a look i've
[40:40] been looking at it in a little different
[40:41] aspect
[40:42] i said you know what it is god knows
[40:44] like we said a good father
[40:46] he knows what it takes for us to grow he
[40:49] knows
[40:49] just just what to do i was thinking
[40:51] about sometimes
[40:53] you and i was staring at sunday we could
[40:55] see these mighty trees sometimes
[40:58] mighty oak trees and or whatever it
[41:00] might be i just use the
[41:02] oak tree but we see them standing tall
[41:05] some of them 50 100 years old and and we
[41:08] might marvel
[41:09] at the at the statue of the presence of
[41:12] that tree
[41:13] but we never one time took in account
[41:17] or come to in our mind to
[41:20] to uh to understanding or even think
[41:23] about what did it take
[41:25] for that tree to get to where to the
[41:27] point to where it's at now
[41:29] what did it take you know for that tree
[41:31] to become that statue
[41:33] i says that you know if trees could talk
[41:37] maybe they'll tell you about some cold
[41:40] winters they had to endure maybe they'll
[41:42] tell you about some
[41:43] storms that they've been through and all
[41:45] these things but nevertheless
[41:48] all of that was the makeup of what they
[41:51] became
[41:52] and you know i said too much anything or
[41:54] kill you
[41:55] you know and god knows that's what you
[41:58] know even for growth
[41:59] too much anything will kill you but it
[42:02] takes a mixture
[42:03] a mixture of sunlight a mixture of water
[42:06] too much water achilles too much
[42:08] sunlight to kill it too much
[42:09] just so it takes a mixture of things to
[42:12] for that for that tree or for that or
[42:15] whatever
[42:16] we're dealing with to grow it take some
[42:18] mixture
[42:19] and sometimes you know we don't want to
[42:22] uh uh um receive uh the mixture of
[42:26] things that god is putting on us
[42:27] in our life but he knows what it takes
[42:30] for us to grow
[42:31] a lot of times i was saying on the other
[42:34] day
[42:34] it's a price that you pay for the
[42:36] anointing
[42:37] it's a price you pay come on it's not
[42:40] that he says that
[42:41] in one place if the many man will follow
[42:44] me let him first deny himself
[42:46] is what he says come on it's hard to
[42:49] deny yourself
[42:50] it's hard to deny yourself forget about
[42:53] you
[42:54] it's hard to forget about you because
[42:56] well we
[42:57] a lot of times we think about ourselves
[42:59] and we want to excel
[43:01] but he says if any man come after me got
[43:03] to first do what
[43:04] he got to deny himself deny himself not
[43:07] only he's asking you to deny yourself
[43:09] but he says but i want you to pick up
[43:10] your cross come on
[43:12] and follow me god is going to do
[43:16] something with you
[43:17] but the first thing he asks you to do is
[43:19] deny yourself
[43:20] then when you deny yourself i want you
[43:22] to carry your cross come on
[43:24] i like how you told paul and one place
[43:26] he says uh
[43:28] i'ma he says he's so told um
[43:31] uh not cornelius but anyway he's told
[43:34] him he says i'ma show him all that he
[43:36] got to shuffle
[43:37] for my namesake come on i'ma show him
[43:40] what he what he's got to suffer so god
[43:42] knows
[43:42] like i said is what it takes you know uh
[43:45] for us to grow
[43:47] a lot of times like we're saying too
[43:49] much anything
[43:51] or kill it but a lot of times it takes
[43:53] depth to grow
[43:55] it takes depth takes you dying
[43:58] come on it's not not looking so much as
[44:01] a naturally but it takes you dying
[44:02] spiritually
[44:04] you know we forget about that sometimes
[44:07] in the in the journey we get relaxed so
[44:10] god throw things your way
[44:12] so you have to get back down on your
[44:13] knees again and die
[44:16] get back down on your knees again you
[44:17] know we look at though like
[44:19] it says those mighty trees you can ask
[44:22] them or see what they've been through
[44:23] it took yeah they went through the
[44:25] spring they went through time of life
[44:27] they went through time of rejoicing but
[44:28] they also have to go through a time of
[44:30] death every year
[44:32] every year they gotta die come on you
[44:34] say the tree
[44:35] did it die no well it look might look
[44:37] like it died but it was still life
[44:39] somewhere down in the roots
[44:41] but god does those things sometimes as
[44:44] the scripture says he purges it come on
[44:46] that he can make a new a more abundance
[44:50] to come forth god's got to purge
[44:52] come on and i thank the lord you know
[44:55] just because we know like
[44:57] he says here in the scriptures that uh
[44:59] the suffering
[45:00] a lot all the chastisement at the time
[45:03] don't seem to be
[45:04] pleasurous or joyous he says but the
[45:07] end fruit of it it the end is going to
[45:10] bring what it's going to be a glorious
[45:12] end to it
[45:13] it's going to be a fruitful end to it if
[45:15] we can make it through that part
[45:17] then it's going to be a fruitful end to
[45:19] it and i thought about that by the grace
[45:21] of god i says what it god
[45:23] being a good father and what it takes to
[45:25] grow god knows
[45:27] like it says uh uh how to
[45:30] how to get us where we need to be at
[45:33] in life you know i think about he says
[45:35] the
[45:36] isaiah said that the year that king azad
[45:38] died i saw the lord
[45:39] come on it took it took god moving
[45:43] things out of his way in order for him
[45:45] to grow you know
[45:46] we we got to understand what what
[45:49] that it ain't it ain't in us but it's in
[45:52] what god is doing come on
[45:54] moving thing god is allowing things to
[45:56] transpire move for what for you to grow
[45:59] you know one thing happens one thing god
[46:01] is a good teacher
[46:02] he ain't one of those teachers that just
[46:04] gonna allow you
[46:06] he know that you ain't understanding the
[46:08] problem or you ain't understanding
[46:10] the test but he gonna just let you slide
[46:12] by but god will fail you
[46:14] he'll fail you because what he wants you
[46:16] to take that test all over again
[46:18] god allow that test to come back come on
[46:20] he is not one of these like he says
[46:22] bad bad teachers or bad followers that's
[46:25] just going to say okay that's all right
[46:26] we'll let you back and you
[46:28] and you didn't get nothing you didn't
[46:30] gain nothing come on
[46:31] but you might have just by memory pass
[46:33] god ain't like that
[46:35] but god wants to see that you grab
[46:38] something out of the equation you grab
[46:40] something out of the situation then what
[46:42] it's time to move on to the next test
[46:45] so we find lord why am i here again look
[46:48] like i'm routing circles
[46:49] look like i've come back to the same
[46:51] place come on the teacher no you ain't
[46:53] quite got it yet
[46:55] the teacher know that it's something
[46:57] that he wants to
[46:58] he he wants the revelation we'll use
[47:00] that word he wants a revelation to click
[47:02] down in your soul
[47:04] he wants something to happen on the
[47:06] inside that you say oh
[47:07] i got it now come on then he anything
[47:10] when it comes your way you got it it
[47:12] clicked
[47:13] it's like second nature to you come on
[47:15] hallelujah how many
[47:16] believe that tonight but i said that's
[47:19] what he does
[47:20] he does that to each and every one of us
[47:23] and you know looking at it i says you
[47:26] know him
[47:26] him being a good father i like how i
[47:29] already said and i say it again
[47:31] you know bill gates made a statement
[47:33] once so people was
[47:34] was was ragging on him and saying that
[47:37] you know
[47:38] all the billions you got says that
[47:41] you're going to take all those billions
[47:42] you and your wife and put it in charity
[47:45] come on and he said he's give you going
[47:47] to give his children at one point only a
[47:49] million dollars a piece
[47:51] come on then they said i'll give them a
[47:53] 10 million dollars a piece
[47:54] some of us wish we had that now but he
[47:57] had
[47:58] he had he got billions that he would
[48:01] give him
[48:02] but they asked him why wouldn't he give
[48:04] it to him
[48:05] he said because if i gave it to him it
[48:08] would destroy them
[48:10] he said they would never develop their
[48:12] own character
[48:14] they'll never find themselves in life
[48:17] he said so he'll do what he can do to
[48:20] help them
[48:21] find themselves in lives not give them
[48:24] something
[48:24] that could potentially destroy them
[48:26] because he was more interested he's more
[48:29] interested in
[48:30] them building character them developing
[48:33] something that could be a beneficiary to
[48:35] the world and
[48:36] others than them giving something giving
[48:38] them something that would destroy them
[48:41] and he began to talk about certain you
[48:43] know individuals and look at what
[48:45] you know the money did to him look at
[48:47] what this did to him it destroyed him
[48:49] you know but listening to that it always
[48:51] something always stuck to me
[48:53] because i said you know even as
[48:56] natural fathers can can see certain
[48:59] situations and
[49:00] and have wisdom on that aspect how much
[49:02] more does god have wisdom
[49:05] on that because because not only that
[49:06] god he sees
[49:08] the beginning but he knows what the end
[49:10] of the story gonna be like
[49:12] he knows it a lot of times we cry we ask
[49:14] for things
[49:15] not knowing but god knows that if he
[49:17] give it to you it'll kill you
[49:19] he know it'll destroy you so what he
[49:21] does as a good father
[49:23] and we can't understand sometimes others
[49:26] might talk and say
[49:27] well why y'all dad this and why you did
[49:29] come on but
[49:30] nevertheless he's a good father he
[49:32] understands that if he give it to you
[49:34] it'll destroy you
[49:35] it'll kill you so he allows us to go
[49:38] through that that trial go through that
[49:40] because he says i want to
[49:41] build character in you i want you i want
[49:44] something
[49:45] in you to develop that won't just be a
[49:48] prophet to you
[49:49] and those around you but that will have
[49:51] an effect on the whole world
[49:53] hallelujah and that's what god wants us
[49:56] to
[49:57] to extend from just amongst your family
[50:00] extend
[50:01] from just amongst your household but god
[50:03] wants to release something in you
[50:05] that'll be
[50:06] a benefit to the whole world then when
[50:08] people
[50:09] see you they'll say ain't these the one
[50:11] that turned the whole world upside down
[50:14] everywhere you go you can be a blessing
[50:16] to somebody else
[50:17] hallelujah you know i was thinking about
[50:20] today
[50:21] on the job and i said you know you look
[50:23] at
[50:24] the out the path that god brought you
[50:26] down you look at
[50:28] where god brought you from sometimes you
[50:30] embarrassed of it sometimes you ashamed
[50:33] but nevertheless i learned to reach back
[50:36] into that place
[50:37] and grab uh uh trophies out of there
[50:40] hallelujah
[50:41] cause i can see i was here hallelujah
[50:43] but now
[50:44] god has picked me up and placed me here
[50:47] i was there once but look at what god
[50:49] did you know i was thinking about that
[50:51] today
[50:52] i said i was on the job and just talking
[50:55] with uh somebody from corporate and you
[50:58] know
[50:59] i said like he was talking to me about
[51:02] he wanted to have a one-on-one talk when
[51:03] we had to talk and
[51:04] you know and i could see certain things
[51:06] he was saying and
[51:08] you know he was going on and talking and
[51:10] and then he says man i don't i don't
[51:13] he cuz i told him i said you know he was
[51:15] talking about
[51:16] certain positions at the job and i said
[51:19] you know my thing is you know
[51:21] i i love to be in church you know i said
[51:24] i love to be in the house of god
[51:26] i said because i said some people
[51:29] they they can say they're saved be
[51:31] christians you know but it don't matter
[51:33] to them whether they come to church or
[51:35] not don't matter to them
[51:36] whether they read their bible or pray or
[51:38] not come on i says but
[51:40] i'm just a little different i said
[51:42] because
[51:43] i said the way he brought me from i said
[51:45] if you only understand or only know
[51:47] what the lord has done for me i said
[51:50] then then you would you would know
[51:51] why i said maybe sometime we get another
[51:54] time i'm gonna sit down and i want to

[52:25] way

[52:42] okay and he says you know he says man
[52:45] he said you know just talking about
[52:46] going to church he says
[52:48] he and just like that he said oh he says
[52:50] you know mike
[52:51] the supervisor no i mean maintenance
[52:53] manager he said yeah he told me you love
[52:55] to go to church
[52:56] he said but he asked a question what if
[52:58] everybody want to go to church
[53:00] i said you know i said well that would
[53:02] be a good thing
[53:03] if everybody wanted to go to church but
[53:06] he began to say
[53:07] he began to say uh yes he said i don't
[53:10] mind
[53:10] you going to church he said but can you
[53:12] come to work at the church
[53:15] come on i said you know the lord is good
[53:18] anyhow amen
[53:19] but i said you know a good father and
[53:22] what it takes to grow
[53:23] god knows i believe that what it takes
[53:26] for you to grow
[53:28] and like i said he he he does things
[53:31] you know sometimes you say he withhold
[53:33] things or whatever but i'm learning we
[53:35] always
[53:36] a lot of times in our mind i mean or in
[53:40] our spirit
[53:40] we're on the asking part lord would you
[53:42] give me this lord would you do that lord
[53:44] would you do this come on
[53:45] but instead i says lord instead of in
[53:48] our mind always be on the asking side
[53:50] i want to say lord what would you have
[53:53] of me
[53:54] time is short come on they say time is
[53:56] winding up time down wound up
[53:58] and if the lord should tarry still yet
[54:01] time is short
[54:02] what what would you do with the look
[54:04] with the time that god has given you
[54:06] god i want to say that lord i gave you
[54:09] all lord
[54:10] i gave you everything every wit every
[54:12] being my mind my whole
[54:14] body soul was subjected of uh uh uh
[54:17] under subjection lord to you to give you
[54:20] all all what you
[54:21] uh have out of my life i don't know
[54:23] about you but i said i want god to use
[54:25] me up
[54:26] hallelujah i was sharing with the church
[54:29] and something that i was saying the
[54:30] thing is
[54:31] you know we always struggling or
[54:34] battling to get
[54:35] back to we want god to be who he was
[54:39] at where what who he was but we got to
[54:42] get back to what we
[54:43] what we used to be we got to get back to
[54:46] that place you know that desperate cry
[54:48] that you cried when you were in trouble
[54:51] that desperate cry when you were in a
[54:53] hole somewhere and looked like that you
[54:55] might die in the morning
[54:56] and yet you cried out so desperate that
[54:59] god
[55:00] and god heard that cry that cry that you
[55:02] cried then it moved him
[55:04] come on that cry moved god that said
[55:06] sometimes we got to get back
[55:08] to that crowd that moved god that cry
[55:11] that makes him
[55:12] get up off his throne that cry that
[55:14] makes him stand up and let all our
[55:16] enemies be scattered that cry
[55:18] that he hear a young one say i got to
[55:20] come to his rescue
[55:21] i said lord get us back to that cry lord
[55:24] hallelujah and a lot of times it takes
[55:27] desperation
[55:29] to get us back to that place and i don't
[55:32] know about you but i said sometimes
[55:34] you know with the with the way things
[55:36] are happening and trans
[55:38] and transpire here now even so quickly
[55:41] it out just it ought to shake you
[55:44] it ought to cause you to stir come on
[55:48] the time go on you know i looked at
[55:51] i said they they dying left and right
[55:54] come on
[55:55] trouble is hitting left and right things
[55:58] are and everything that can be shaken is
[56:00] shaken
[56:01] right now but nevertheless i says that
[56:04] we
[56:04] we lord right now are needy people
[56:08] god we need your help we need your
[56:10] anointing
[56:11] we need the double portion we need the
[56:14] fire
[56:14] come on again in our life the drought
[56:17] has about
[56:17] killed us all lord we need you to send
[56:20] the rain again
[56:21] think about elijah three and a half
[56:23] years no rain the people were dying come
[56:26] on
[56:26] the grounds was dried up hallelujah but
[56:29] it
[56:30] came a time that god was going to send
[56:32] rain again came a time where he says
[56:34] if your god be god and let them answer
[56:36] by fire lord
[56:37] we need to reign again come on the
[56:39] drought is everywhere it's hidden it's
[56:41] taking folks out
[56:42] killing sometimes churches at the time
[56:45] lord we need to reign again
[56:47] the enemy has come in and and swept
[56:50] through come on i was thinking about the
[56:53] great robbery come on
[56:54] the devil has come rob the church of
[56:57] their blessings
[56:58] robbed in search of the spirit the true
[57:01] baptism of the holy ghost like they had
[57:03] it in the book of acts one
[57:04] that they can stand up and say that this
[57:07] is that
[57:07] hallelujah we need that today
[57:10] you say how why it's not just for a show
[57:13] but we need it
[57:15] people are dying people are sick
[57:18] people are losing everything including
[57:20] their minds
[57:22] hallelujah but it's going to take god to
[57:24] hold us together
[57:25] it's going to take his spirit i believe
[57:28] that coming down giving us a refreshing
[57:30] again
[57:31] a refreshing to get our mind off of the
[57:33] world get our mind from being relaxed
[57:36] hallelujah give us a refreshing to pick
[57:39] us up and carry us
[57:40] into those heavenly places so where we
[57:42] can sit down and hear god's voice again
[57:45] i don't know about you i said lord but
[57:47] we long to hear your voice
[57:49] we long to see your spirit we long to
[57:51] see you do something again
[57:53] in our lives how many want that tonight
[57:56] but a good father come on he knows what
[57:59] it takes
[58:00] for us to grow he knows what it takes to
[58:04] get us to get us to that place you know
[58:06] i want to say
[58:07] some other things and you know just to
[58:09] dwell on it
[58:10] on that on that good father you know i
[58:13] said sometimes
[58:14] you know he knows and i can't i can't
[58:17] get there i said
[58:18] he but he knows what it takes you know i
[58:21] thought about
[58:22] joseph and how what he went through to
[58:24] get where he got
[58:26] but look at the character that he
[58:28] developed through that
[58:30] it took him going through those things
[58:33] to become who he was
[58:35] and even in that he realized looking
[58:38] back
[58:39] that he could tell his brothers you know
[58:41] as we were saying that
[58:43] here in the scriptures how it says no
[58:45] chastisement at the present time seems
[58:47] yours but the end of it it's going to
[58:49] bring peace if you would endure or you
[58:51] hold out
[58:51] it's going to bring a fruitful end and i
[58:54] could see joseph
[58:55] telling his brothers you didn't uh uh do
[58:58] it
[58:59] you didn't do it you had nothing it was
[59:01] god that done it
[59:03] god sent me here that come on like it
[59:05] says
[59:06] not to to just be something about
[59:08] himself but that he can be a blessing to
[59:10] others it was god
[59:12] that sent me here come on and now he
[59:14] realizing
[59:15] it took him it took him down that road
[59:17] he went through some things
[59:19] they get where he was at but the father
[59:21] knew what it take because
[59:23] he nevertheless you know joseph was
[59:25] going to be a ruler joseph
[59:27] was going to be in a position to rule
[59:29] but god knew
[59:30] what what to do to get him to that
[59:33] position that where
[59:34] when he got in that position to rule
[59:36] come on power
[59:37] without character he said satanic but
[59:39] power with characters fit the rule god
[59:42] knows
[59:43] what it took to get him there and
[59:44] sometimes when we think we're ready god
[59:46] no we still ain't ready
[59:47] he still takes us and carries makes us
[59:50] and moses
[59:51] into the place to where he says now i'm
[59:54] gonna put you in charge
[59:55] how many believe that tonight and it
[59:57] still won't be you because you
[59:59] are always in subject to the under
[1:00:02] subjection to the father
[1:00:03] you're always looking for his guidance
[1:00:05] you always looking for his leadership
[1:00:08] in him to be the rule of your life how
[1:00:10] many want that tonight
[1:00:11] i said a good father amen
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:15] [Applause]
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:28] praise praise the lord amen
[1:00:31] we thank the lord for the word tonight
[1:00:35] we appreciate it
[1:00:40] appreciate the word amen god is good
[1:00:44] love the lord you heard my cry amen
[1:00:49] great greetings from saints down in
[1:00:51] mullins say
[1:00:53] praise you
[1:00:57] we had a wonderful service down there
[1:01:00] the thanks seem to be
[1:01:02] really stirred in the lord and
[1:01:05] appreciate
[1:01:06] brother gordon and saints carrying on up
[1:01:08] here we certainly appreciate that we
[1:01:12] kind of took some of the musicians and
[1:01:14] everything and
[1:01:15] when i looked at the service and y'all
[1:01:17] made it through thank the lord
[1:01:20] god bless y'all amen we just thank god
[1:01:23] for
[1:01:25] if we're faithful to him that's what
[1:01:27] makes the difference
[1:01:29] amen when it's all said and done how
[1:01:31] faithful are we to him
[1:01:33] it's not how faithful we are to
[1:01:34] ourselves but how faithful
[1:01:36] are we to god amen
[1:01:40] sometimes i just saying lord you're so
[1:01:42] faithful to me
[1:01:43] but how faithful are we to him that's
[1:01:46] another thing
[1:01:48] and i tell you it's the little things
[1:01:50] that we do for god that makes the
[1:01:52] difference
[1:01:54] and it's the little things that we don't
[1:01:56] do that's going to make the difference
[1:01:58] it's not
[1:01:58] it won't be this great big thing amen
[1:02:01] the reason why some folks said lord lord
[1:02:04] then i do
[1:02:04] many wonderful works in your name cast
[1:02:07] out devils i did all this he said depart
[1:02:09] from me
[1:02:10] your work was of iniquity it could have
[1:02:13] been that little small
[1:02:14] person that you thought was insufficient
[1:02:16] that you thought was
[1:02:17] nothing and you just looked over that
[1:02:19] one and
[1:02:20] it could have been that you know little
[1:02:23] thing that god said spoke to your heart
[1:02:25] said i want you to do this
[1:02:27] and you say well that's too it's too
[1:02:30] small for me
[1:02:32] sometimes it's the little things as he
[1:02:35] said the little foxes spoiler blind
[1:02:38] vine and it's a little level that leaven
[1:02:40] the whole lump
[1:02:41] it's the little things that god is going
[1:02:43] to ex require of us it's not the big
[1:02:46] things amen it's just like name a name i
[1:02:48] wanted to
[1:02:49] you know why you're going to ask me to
[1:02:50] dip in more than muddy jordan
[1:02:53] it's the little things in our lives that
[1:02:55] god is going to require
[1:02:56] just being faithful to him just being
[1:03:00] faithful to god not to man but to god
[1:03:03] i think we get it mixed up sometimes we
[1:03:07] think
[1:03:07] what we do we're doing it for the church
[1:03:09] we're doing it for the pastor we're
[1:03:11] doing it for a man
[1:03:12] but we don't know what we do we're doing
[1:03:14] it for god
[1:03:16] and when we do it for god and we're
[1:03:18] faithful to him
[1:03:20] then god will reward you because you're
[1:03:23] doing it
[1:03:24] as unto the lord and
[1:03:27] it's another thing is i listened to him
[1:03:31] you know i thought about the pain
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:34] that i was having just to walk
[1:03:38] and then a lot of times i took the stick
[1:03:42] the cane and my wife went and bought me
[1:03:45] a cane
[1:03:45] and i was you know in so much
[1:03:49] severe pain i thought about it's a
[1:03:52] blessing to be able to
[1:03:53] walk up here and not be in pain
[1:03:57] and i thought about uh today when i was
[1:04:01] taking the blood pressure and i can see
[1:04:04] you know 120
[1:04:05] something over 77 i says
[1:04:08] you know i didn't take the blood
[1:04:10] pressure medicine and
[1:04:12] and i said thank the lord i didn't take
[1:04:15] it
[1:04:15] a couple days you know and i'm still
[1:04:18] seeing
[1:04:18] you know the you know no pressure
[1:04:23] god is good and i said well
[1:04:27] i'm not telling you don't take your
[1:04:28] medicine
[1:04:30] but a lot of times god
[1:04:33] god can do what he want to do if you
[1:04:36] trust him and you believe in him
[1:04:39] then you let god do what he does well
[1:04:43] and i said it's just a privilege i'm so
[1:04:47] inspired i'm so happy because
[1:04:50] i know within myself there's no way
[1:04:54] that i know what to do
[1:04:57] when it comes down to leadership
[1:04:59] guidance it's no
[1:05:01] way that if i get in myself for two
[1:05:05] minutes
[1:05:06] we probably have two people left
[1:05:10] see what i'm saying but if i let god
[1:05:12] handle things
[1:05:14] he knows what's best for each and every
[1:05:16] one of us
[1:05:18] and that's why it takes pride it takes
[1:05:20] god
[1:05:21] moving in our lives and i pray
[1:05:24] god you move in each and every one
[1:05:28] of your children's life each and every
[1:05:30] home
[1:05:31] each and every family god you move in at
[1:05:33] home you move in their life
[1:05:35] if you don't make changes in our lives
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:38] there's no use you know somebody said
[1:05:41] well i'll do what you say
[1:05:43] no do what the spirit says do what god
[1:05:46] says if you do it for man
[1:05:48] then you'll start doing it but if you do
[1:05:52] it for god
[1:05:52] and you make changes that go for god
[1:05:56] and you know your relationship is with
[1:05:58] the father
[1:06:00] not amen not with man with the father
[1:06:03] your relationship was with the father
[1:06:06] god amen and that's what i
[1:06:10] i was talking to somebody i said you
[1:06:13] know
[1:06:13] it's very real that people
[1:06:16] can get all i think brother david in
[1:06:20] something
[1:06:21] i said people can get all the knowledge
[1:06:24] all the mysteries and then
[1:06:27] with all the mistress they they they
[1:06:29] have no relationship personal
[1:06:31] relationship with god
[1:06:33] and don't know if it's god it's god in
[1:06:36] them they're not saved they don't know
[1:06:38] what it means
[1:06:38] to talk to god and to listen to god talk
[1:06:41] back to them
[1:06:42] they have no relationship with god
[1:06:46] and i i you know to have a relationship
[1:06:48] with god
[1:06:49] that means your your life began to be
[1:06:53] conformed to his image you begin to walk
[1:06:57] like god
[1:06:58] talk like god you begin to
[1:07:02] amen nobody somebody can say well
[1:07:05] i know that person is saved i know that
[1:07:07] person people
[1:07:08] if if you hadn't heard it lately it's
[1:07:11] something special about you
[1:07:13] it's something different about you if
[1:07:16] nobody tells you that
[1:07:17] constantly but you have to tell people i
[1:07:20] am saved
[1:07:21] you know what i'm saying don't say
[1:07:23] nothing just go on your job
[1:07:26] work hard don't even talk about the lord
[1:07:29] just just be godly and watch what people
[1:07:33] do
[1:07:33] if you your light is shining you'll find
[1:07:36] people say something is different about
[1:07:38] you
[1:07:39] you say what yeah something's different
[1:07:42] then you got your chance
[1:07:44] are you with me but if you got to
[1:07:49] you know i want to tell you you need to
[1:07:51] be safe you need to do this you need to
[1:07:53] do that
[1:07:53] no no no no no you need to be quiet
[1:07:57] and pray for that person and the person
[1:08:00] that's doing the
[1:08:01] the that's persecuting you and doing the
[1:08:04] worst things that
[1:08:06] on the job they really just tearing you
[1:08:08] down
[1:08:11] that person is perfecting you
[1:08:14] are you with me i was going to preach a
[1:08:17] message promotion
[1:08:20] you know when um shadrach and meshach
[1:08:22] and abednego got promoted
[1:08:26] after they went in the fire then the
[1:08:29] king said we're going to promote them
[1:08:31] are you whooping now what you do
[1:08:34] you mess with your promotion when you
[1:08:37] think somebody's throwing you in the
[1:08:39] fire
[1:08:39] and you respond and react in the wrong
[1:08:42] way
[1:08:42] amen you lose the victory and you're not
[1:08:46] promoted because you did not pass the
[1:08:48] test isn't that right
[1:08:50] but when they went through after they
[1:08:52] went in the fire
[1:08:53] the king said it's time for what
[1:08:56] y'all to be promoted look at joseph
[1:08:59] everything he went through
[1:09:01] but it was taking him to what promotion
[1:09:05] amen and that's what god want to do he
[1:09:07] wants to promote you maybe
[1:09:08] maybe i'll talk about it suddenly if
[1:09:11] you're ready to be promoted
[1:09:13] amen then it's a way that god's going to
[1:09:16] test
[1:09:17] and prove you and see whether or not

[1:09:41] doing you wrong
[1:09:45] y'all hear me when you think people are
[1:09:48] doing you wrong
