Us in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight we turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll start in verse 19 and it reads speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourself one to another in the fear of God and amen we'll turn to one more scripture first Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians 5 we'll start in verse 15 says see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good among both among yourself and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you amen God bless reading of the word you may be seated amen tonight I speak on a very simple topic and I entitled it be thankful be thankful and I read the scriptures here because in verse 18 it said in everything give thanks in everything give thanks in the good and the bad give thanks and everything that that life may throw at you give thanks and said sometimes sometimes we go through life and I remember there was a a short story there was a they said there was a pig and he was under an apple tree and the pig was Under The Apple Tree and the apples kept falling out the tree and the pig kept eating and the pig kept eating but never once did the pig look up to look where the apples were coming from never once did the pig look up to be grateful that the apples was falling down and they had something to eat and it reminds us that sometimes that when God is doing great things and wonderful things in your life sometimes you you may you counting all the blessings but you're always wanting more and you forget to be thankful you forget to turn around and say Lord I Thank you for what you're doing Lord I Thank thank you for how you Blessing Me Lord I Thank You for Your many wonderful blessings that you're providing over my life and I thought about it I said many times we turn around and we see everyone and God is doing Mighty and wondrous works but sometimes we have to be careful to say Lord I Thank You Lord I Thank you for all the things that you've done as he said in James and everything give thanks and for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you it's something that God concerns us with that we remember that where I help come comes from we remember that what he's done for us and even when we look like in our lowest moments we can still give God thanks because we can realize that God is just working on us he's molding us and building us and building that character only so that we can make it in he said he's building us into a statue of a perfect man that's what God is doing and in the test and the trials I can still be thankful as the songwriter said cuz God is not through with me yet said God is doing a work that no man can do no man can can do I said I think about it as they said he's the pot and we're the clay and sometime God got to break the mold he got to break those things so that he can remold you he can refashion you said Lord I can be thankful that Lord you're making me into a worthy vessel Lord you're making me into something that you can use said one song writer said I want to be a willing vessel an instrument that you can use so I can be thankful in the text I can be thankful in the trials and be careful the Lord to give you all the things said there was some people in the Bible that showed us that even through the test and the trials they could give God thanks even through the hardships they can give God thanks and the most one that everyone should think about is job all the things that the devil took from him job said naked I came into this world and naked I shall return and he would never turn back on God he was always thankful to God for what he was doing even though he didn't understand it sometimes you may go through something and you say Lord why Lord why is this happening to me why is this happening to me now but those are the moments where you say Lord I want to give you thanks I want to come to you and say thank you Lord that you still are working on me I said as I spoke the last time I said how do you know that God loves you is because he's still working on you every day that you hear that voice that tell you right from wrong says that God is still there working on you he's still moving in your life and I can be thankful that God is doing that and he says says here in I'm gonna read real quick says here in James chapter one and I I'll read it in James chapter 1 and verse 2 it says and my brethren countered all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting n nothing see and if anyone if any of you lack wisdom let them ask of God that God give it to all men liberally and unrath not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering but he that Werth is like a wave of the sea toss With the Wind with the wind and tossed for let for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in his ways let the brother of low degree rejoice in he that is exalted but the rich in that he is made low because of the flower and the grass shall pass away for the sun is no sooner risen with the burning Heat but it withth the grass and the flowers therefore falleth and the grace F the grace of the fashion of it perish so also shall the rich man fade away but blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord ha promised to them that loved him see there's something to be thankful for even in your test and trial there's something to be thankful for cuz he said bless is a man that endureth temptation but when he is tried he shall receive a Crown of Life I think Pastor said one time he said he said oh Lord it escaped me I I remember that and then it was gone oh Lord yeah it'll come back but he was speaking about our here he basically said no Crown no glory or something like that so sometimes you got to go through something to get something sometimes you got to do something to get something if you want something to happen sometimes in order for your car to start you got to turn the key in order for you to open the door you got to turn the door knob or push the door it doesn't just many of times it doesn't open by itself unless you have the automatic doors where you're waving your hand in front of it everybody understand what I'm saying so the door you have there's a for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction that's that's what you learn in in science in school so there has to be something but even with those I can be grateful for what God is doing I can be thankful for what God is doing knowing that he knows all things he knew my end from my beginning and he allowed me to go through it because he wanted to get Glory so I can give him thanks because he wanted someone to give him thanks that's why he went to Calvary that's why he shed his blood so that he could be a savior that's why he went there and took the stripes on his back so that he could be a Healer he said byy your stripes I am healed so he had to go through that to to to get to to be a Healer and he had to go through that to be a Healer he had to go through that because he was he wanted to be a savior and he and he did that because he loved us and said I want to read something here he said and Jesus was here confronting the greatest test that he had ever had um Gethsemane laid just before him where that he once and finally all sufficient test must come this was talking about when Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane right before they came and Judas portrayed him he said that he came to the greatest test that ever was performed he said said when the burdens of the entire world was laid upon his blessed shoulders just think about it when Jesus was there and he was praying and interceding the burdens of the entire world all the burdens that ever was and ever would come was on his shoulders and there was no one in all heaven or earth that could ever stood it but him there's no one that could take his place and and to know that all the sins of past sins and present sins and future sins rested upon this decision see that was this was a Monumental decision that was about to happen and it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his great messiahship as when he said to God not my will thine be done see that was one of the most pivotal decisions of History cuz that was the only time that was the only moment that was the moment that God allowed us to to have a path to get back to heaven after Eve had fell and everything that had transpired Jesus came and he was the only one that could do it he said not my will but thine be thine that was the greatest Victory he had ever won all the Demons of Torment was was around to tempt him and try him and when we get right with God when our hearts become pure and the Holy Spirit has taken his place in our heart it's the most glorious thing to have testing the Bible tells us that our testing and trials are more precious to us than silver and gold of this world so we are should be thankful so they said we should be thankful cuz our test and trials are more precious to us than silver or gold of this world see that's that's what it is sometimes you look and you say and and you wonder why but God said it's worth it you got to realize that it's worth it and I can be thankful and grateful because I know it's worth it sister wi sings the song I know it's worth it I think God is worth it to make Heaven my home it's it's worth your dying it's worth your you're living and all you're giving say I know that it's worth it to make Heaven my home so I can be thankful and I can be grateful because I know it's worth it see there's no doubt in my mind that living a Christian Life is worth it there's no doubt in my my mind that what God can do for me is greater than what the devil can what the pathways that I choose are important and I can be grateful that God has allowed me the choice to choose the right thing I can be grateful that God has given me an opportunity each day I live and breathe the Lord I choose to do what you want me to do and I and I wrote down something I wrote down something that I was thinking about it as a different thing and I was thinking about it and I asked the question are you sad satisfied I said are you satisfied with what God has given you and I said I think about some times in the Bible there was people that got unsatisfied they looked at all they had and they said we want more we want more but they wasn't grateful they wasn't thankful I think about Nimrod and the Tower of Babel where they decided that they they didn't want to just have the Earth they wanted to go to heaven too they wanted to build something that they could be just like God they they wanted to go to the heavens but God God had to come and said they weren't thankful and grateful for what they had and God came and he confused the languages and dispersed them all across the Earth cuz they weren't grateful and thankful I think about the children of Israel well they they were getting the Angels food they were getting what the Angels were eating and they weren't grateful and thankful and they complained they complained about what God was giving them they complained about the the M they didn't realize it was a miracle that every day show up and have food on the ground it was a miracle to have meat come out of nowhere it was a miracle to have water come out of a rock see that it was a miracle and they weren't grateful and thankful for the cloud by day that was something they had gotten so used to seeing that cloud they wasn't grateful for it no more they wasn't they forgot how God had brought them out of Egypt they might have not thought about what how tremendous of a blessing it was for him to destroy all the enemies in the Red Sea it how grateful or how amazing it was for God to bring them through the plagues and only one plague come against them but God made a way of Escape for them by just applying the blood to their doost see they wasn't grateful and they got there and they started complaining they got they started saying why we got to eat this every day why we got to do this and why we got to this I don't like this and many of times sometime have you heard yourself saying I don't like this or I don't or I don't want this I had this yesterday that I don't want this food I had this yesterday why we got to eat the same thing and see that's when you come to the point where you realize that L am I not grateful am I not grateful for the ones that's providing this for me am I not grateful for the ones that's putting this food on the table and saying thank you for all the hard work and if they parent if your parents do that what more do you think God does for you what more do you think God does for you when he is the one that wakes you up every morning it gives you breath in your body just to live and then he gives you strength in your arms and your legs to walk around and pick up things and strengthen your hands and strengthen your body what more does he have to do for you to turn around and say Lord I Thank you said that he healed when I remember the story in the Bible where there was 10 lepers and they came to Jesus and he healed all 10 of them and he said go show yourself to the priest and they went running off and only one came back to say thank you shows you that all the rest of them they got what they wanted and then they once they got what they wanted they would they didn't need Jesus no more they didn't need Jesus no more but there was one that realized you know this is something special that just happened here I could have still been a leopard if it wasn't for Jesus I could have still been in my sin if it wasn't for Jesus I could have still been going on and being separated from everyone else and I'm grateful and I'm thankful for what he did for me and I want to tell him so I want to tell him so and sometimes you realize that you know what do I thank those ones that are around me the ones that I realize that it it is a sacrifice what they do even though you sometimes you say well they should do it cuz they such and such they my parents or they my grandparents or or they this they should do it but no they don't cuz there's people that don't have that that don't have that provided for them but am I grateful and thankful for what's being given to me each and every day am I grateful and turn around thank you for providing the food thank you for going to work thank you for your sacrifice thank you because there's some that don't sacrifice there's some that go out and they live their life and say you you figure it out but God has allowed you to have people in your life that provide for you that provide for you and if they do it how much more does God do for you each and every day say are you satisfied with what God has given you sometimes we we live in a society where we always want the next thing we always want more or want better we always and there's nothing I think you should always continue to improve and do those things but are you grateful for what's being given to you right now are you thankful and saying Lord I Thank you for what you've done thus far and if you don't do nothing else I'm still thankful if you don't do nothing more than this Lord I'm still grateful Lord if you if you don't give me more Lord I'm still thankful Lord I'm thankful I said sometimes they say that God can't give you more because you're not using what you got and and God he sometimes he waiting for you to turn around and say Lord I Thank you for what I got I thank you for what I got thus far and I'm grateful and I'm thankful for what you give given me thus far and Lord and Lord and and then God can bless you with more God can give you more when the children of Israel got grateful they realized that that that once they realized that they could go over and those ones that had passed away that said we can't go in the promised land those on God had to let them pass away to A Whole New Generation came so that they could go into the promised land and Joshua could lead them and say what God Joshua and Caleb they believe that what he's given us it's ours it's ours we can go get it and we can be thankful and grateful because God has already given us the victory God has already given us the victory I think about what what in Joshua knows in the story of aen God had given them that City and they and Joshua Joshua knew that God had given them the Victory and he question he said why are these why did why did these soldiers die something must not be right at home he had to go back and examine what what was in his home what was going on and they found out achen had took those things when they were supposed to leave it and and God God punished aen it wasn't anything that man did but God did it and then they went and they took that City cuz God had gave it given it to them and they was grateful and thankful CU what God has done many of times you don't understand the depths of what God has done for you many of times we can't understand the depths of what God has done for us we can't understand how many things God has blocked and kept away from us because of his rich and mercies on our lives because someone was praying for you when you thought you was in your low moment and didn't realize how much lower it could have been you don't realize how much worse it could have been when God just allowed you to see a glimpse or to experience a glimpse of how far it can go but God raised you up and said no Lord I Thank you and I'm grateful for what you've done I'm grateful for how much you spared my life I'm grateful for how much you blessed my life I've seen others that were beside me that have stumbled and fell but Lord I Thank you for what you're doing in my life Lord I'm grateful for what you you brought me out of Lord I'm grateful for what you taught me Lord I'm Grateful that I'm alive today to stand here and say thank you Lord that I can lift my hands and say thank you you Lord that I can get on my knees and say thank you Lord that I can stand and pray every day and say Lord thank you Lord Lord you didn't have to do it but you did Lord you didn't have to die but you did Lord you didn't have to wake me up this morning but you did you didn't have to give me life health and strength but you did and I can say thank you Lord s this is the season of Thanksgiving but every day is a moment to say Thank You Lord each and every day when you get up and you have food on your table it's a day to say thank you than you Lord you have a roof over your head to say Thank You Lord cuz there's people that don't have it every day that there's peace in your home you can say thank you Lord we can just look at Israel and see there's bombings there's people that's dying every day go to Ukraine and see how they're living and you we have the nerve to say I want something and they living in poverty they're living in war turn and everyone's carrying guns where they are and we're not thankful and grateful that God has still allowed us the opportunity to come into to his house they come into his house and say thank you Lord I can come with a song of Thanksgiving and a song of praise cuz I know that God is still merciful and gracious to me to allow me to walk into these doors to say Thank You Lord thank you for allowing me to be here thank you for allowing me to listen to your word again Lord thank you for allowing me to still read my Bible to still be able to pray and not be persecuted that's that's the god that we serve that even in you say Lord in Wrath remember Mercy cuz God can take this away just like that and then one day you wake up and you can't go to church you can't you can't you got to hide and do these things but God is still allowing us a little bit of grace and mercy to be here to come together say I I got to take advantage of these opportunities CU you never know how many more you got left just in the hospital the other day and I I was looking there and I was said Lord God can do anything because he's God but some days you got to think about it well if God don't raise you up are you ready are you ready to go and every day everybody's walking around even if you're healthy you could be gone tomorrow just like that and you just say I seen people young people that's gone they wake up one day and then they then they gone the next day you say what happened they can't even find some some of the things that are wrong with them but each and every day I can be thankful and grateful to God that God has given me an opportunity to give him praise God has given me an opportunity to come to him and say thank you God has given me an opportunity said Lord if this is my day Lord I want to make sure everything is right with you I want to make sure that my house is in order I want to make sure that Lord you order my steps today Lord I want you to move in my life so that you can get the glory Lord I want to move on my job so that people know that you are God I want to be a witness for you Lord I want to be a willing vessel and Lord I want you to use Me For Your Glory see that's the reasons that we can all look up and say Lord I want to be thankful I I and you say I might not have much to thank you for but each of us got something to thank God for no matter how old you are how young you are you got a reason to say Lord I thank you because of what you've done for me and you may not stand everything but you can thank God for what he's done for you in the small things in the Small Things cuz God has been good whether you recognize it or not God is still good says sometime God is keeping you from things because somebody is praying for you somebody is praying for you and God Is Watching Over You he's putting a hedge around you like he did job said Lord put a hedge around him and God is doing that he's interceding cuz somebody's praying for you and you can be grateful and say Lord I Thank you for what you're doing for me I thank you for being so good and so gracious to me that you allowing me to see one more day that you allowing me to see one more minute one more second Lord I thank you because there's some that don't thank you for life health and strength because God is that good he's just been that good to us and that's more and more reasons that we can give him thanks amen [Applause] amen Ry Thanksgiving and folks was thinking about eating eating eat eating and not thanking the lord for providing amen so we thank God for I was in the restaurant and had a buffet and um had a young fell in there he probably in his 30s or 40s and I look like he's just finished eating look like and he must have wor about 4 500 pound and I I saw him because he had a walker he was rocking in his seat trying to get up and I thought about I said Oh I thought about my days working in the hospital how patients couldn't get up and nobody wanted to help them so I said even though I'm old and gray-headed I thought in my head myself let me go over here help this man CU he look like he finish eating I'm going to help him get up and now um you kept rocking and something said hold up I said okay hold up and he rocked and he rocked and he got up and I thought he was going he got two plates and stack stacked them up I said Lord have mercy I I said I'm going to help him go back to that bar again and get two more plates and pile them up I said you know that's something you know I felt so sorry for it I felt so sorry I said Lord and then I was thankful as I was listening to the message tonight I was thankful when I got my fence go for the year and the doctor called me he says everything is good everything is good you said just lose some weight you need to lose some more you need to lose weight and every with no diabetes no high blood no this no that you all right just lose some weight now okay so uh I was thankful because I was feeling pretty good when you hear good report like that and you feel so good and you want to get out and maybe run a mile or something you feel so good you know you go to the doctor and he tell you I'll see you next year I don't want to go at all just to get a report I just don't like going to the doctor just you know I thought about some days you wake up and you're in pain most of these young people don't know what it feels like to really be in terrible pain but but if you had a day of severe pain and most of the time you lived long enough you've had some days where you had some aches and some really serious pain and sometimes when you don't have the pain you can say thank you Lord It's good to wake up and I can walk and I'm not in pain and not hurting feeling good good some days you get up you got arthritis some days you get up and you just sluggish and they but when you can get up and you feel good and sometimes I think when you're young you don't even think about feeling bad and if you felt bad you think you Fe you think you really bad
