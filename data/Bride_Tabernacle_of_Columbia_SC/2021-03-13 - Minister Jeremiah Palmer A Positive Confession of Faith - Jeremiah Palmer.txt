heavenly father we want to thank you tonight for your mercy god and for your grace that you stood upon each and every one of us father we actually forgive us of our sins lord and cleanse us from all unrighteousness of the flesh and the spirit lord we pray for the special needs lord our brother larry nichols though god in recovery father we ask you to continue to touch him in a mighty way lord

in the name of jesus christ amen and amen you have your bibles tonight you turn with us to the book of romans the fourth chapter [Music] again i do want to appreciate each and every one of you for your cards and your gifts and your calling and just praying for us and family uh through the time bereavement we appreciate each and every one and my family do send their regards again to you and thank you for everything amen in jesus christ's name tonight the book of romans the fourth chapter let's start at the 13th verse and to the 21st romans 4 and 13. for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of non-effect because the law worketh wrath where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i had made thee a father of many nation before him whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and calleth those thing which be not as though they were who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead wherein he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of sarah roon he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform let us pray father we thank you god for the reading of your word and we pray that you quicken it lord sanctified it'll be nurtured into our body in jesus name amen may be seated [Music] i want to use for a little thought tonight a positive confession of faith a positive confession of faith and when we look at the word positive it means fully assured or confident that something will be or will happen but it got to be a positive confession we all time like to say that uh you know we don't really realize it i believe to the fullness that what you say out of your mouth has power in it one person life in depth is in the power of the tongue but the call gave us a book being said hung by the tongue and i believe as you know as uh you know being in the body that and how we were born that is simply to be such um easy thing to always dwell on the negative because a lot of times we weren't taught certain principles we weren't taught that be careful what you say or you might have it and being in sin but i believe that's why it's so important that when we become a new creature we have been born of the spirit of god then we want to try to develop the characteristic that god has and that's positive amen in other words we now are in training to train ourselves and sometimes we get a little you know carried away but you have to put yourself back in check and understand that i can't be saying anything out of my mouth i can't do well on how i feel or what's going on with me i got to look at the greater picture and say lord thank you for everything i'm learning saying that somebody's singing and learning how to lean it depends on jesus but i understand that we always know and quote that uh the greatest battle we have with this is being able to uh confess positive is because the mind-setting and i'm learning that i don't mind is a devil workshop where we struggle the most and don't really understand that when you let your mind just run away with things but understanding that no no no i can't allow that you can't just allow your mind as one person said you know you can't stop the thought from coming but you don't have to let them build a nest there when they do come and i'm going to read something on that but i i'll merely uh want to you know and i and i'm learning myself you know they say you're never uh too old to learn and we are learning god is training us the word that he gave us is teaching us uh to change our tone of speech you know that we want to inject but be sure that what you injecting is is something that's gonna help somebody you know and not because i i found that when a person is already down the worst thing you can do is to try to add he needs to be lifted up i believe that's what god wanted he want to lift us up we we're dwelling in a country and especially now with all negative on everywhere the radio negative the tv negative facebook negative youtube negative hospital job church and where you going the grocery store this negative but let's let's turn it turn this thing inside yes it but god is in control of it because if we don't we become victims of things that we really don't want here i'm looking uh at abraham and you know when god made this promise to abraham it was nothing that abraham had to do because it was under unconditional god said it from the beginning and we understand that um if it was something that you know how we make promises that we can't hardly keep you know but god is not like that when god ever promised something he can and will perform it but it depends on the people that receive that you don't want to say one place that faith come by hearing and hearing the word but that word just a letter but that word we don't have to say that faith is a revelation it's a substance of things hoped for not the evidence of things not seen or seen what you see is not faith so faith has to be something that god reveals to you as an individual and i believe as you need uh to know that uh when special when you are sick you know we have so much promises on that but one isaiah killed it all by his stripes we are healed now healing your healing don't dwell on how you feel it doesn't matter what kind of report you might even get from going to the doctors but faith looks beyond reports faith looks at god in god there isn't never will be any failure he has never said anything that he cannot perform i like it one place when he's saying how's that it says that my word has gone out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void but a positive confession when you see things that may be going in a different direction in our lives how you perceive it how you look at that it's going to determine what kind of results you're going to get we have in this day so much there's been bombarding that has been told us and this and that and this and that and just listening to it it'll make you feel bad but you can't just sit in that kind of uh atmosphere you got to create a positive atmosphere there is god table and please say that you are more than able why because i made the way already for you you don't have to worry you don't have to feel he said feel not little flock you know one day i i know that this word has got to come to a reality that there's gonna be a people that's gonna not just take it as information spoken but it's gonna be a revelation that they know that this is what god promised me now every promise in the book is yours but it depends on how you are taking it all by to say all these precious promises that god has given to us and sometimes we just sit and look at them i wonder you know what i need to do sir god say one place here he said now faith is the only direct of sense he said faith is more than sight but it's a supernatural sixth sense he called it it looked beyond the conditions it looked beyond symptoms it looked beyond what's going on and is seen positive it's seen victory it sees overcoming power in spite of what's going on in the world i'm not going to let the devil steal my joy oh that you're going through it oh that's what's going on i still got joy regardless of what they are talking we're not listening to that we're listening to another voice oh my i wonder how we heard that voice lately let me tell you something you sit there and listen to them other voices uh just it's sadly but he said faith is direct it don't dwell on how you feel it don't dwell on how it looks not i would tell us why i said a you may be seeing it just right with your natural eye what you saying is it's nothing but the truth but you looking beyond what these eyes see see but you're looking in the eyes of a spiritual being and that's why the son of god he said revelation to a true believer means more to you than what you think he said not just the book of revelation but all revelation so god said if you begin to confess you were not saved he said then you are not saved and then your life gonna exemplify what you say that's why working with the people in maryland i'm telling them you know about the holy ghost i say when you understand that it's a promise that god gave to you then you can claim that you can you ain't just claiming something you know that no no it's your problem because he said to you and to your children and many that are far off it's given to you after you repent be baptized in the name of lord jesus christ for the remission of your sin ye shall receive the holy ghost confess it if you did the requirement you can say lord according to your word and all that i know to do lord i did what you told me father god now lord let your word be made manifested in my life in other words be it unto me oh i imagine how mary said that thing you know when it came to her she said be it unto me according to your word and she brought forth but a positive confession we understand that you can create a certain atmosphere with your confession something always wrong nothing nothing never right if the sun don't come out i wonder why if it rains why it raining so much when it stops i wonder when it gonna rain again it just we do that because we fail to understand that you know whatever one player said whatever state you find yourself in be content but now if it's a negative state you got to come out of that don't stay there and just drown in drowsiness you know this drowsy drowsy drowsy no no you have to change the way you speaking you have to reverse that thing and you're the only one that can do it the pastor can't no preacher can it's you and god is is training us to understand now let me let me tell you something he said now nothing can happen to you unless i allow it and if i allow that to happen i got a purpose so everything that happened to your life god got a purpose and if it's god's purpose the lord thank you i may not understand it but thank you anyhow i may don't see why but lord i know it's working for my good everything god allowed to happen is working for your good yes tragedy working for your good and that's what god is wants to do he he he wants to purging us he want got to get all the drugs and all of this uh worldliness of how we you know some people you say well why are you he said well i always been like that and my mama was that daddy and so i'm always that kind of person but is that the kind of person god wants you to be because all of us inherit things down through those genes but there's some things you got to understand that no no no i don't need that you know and you got to understand that to cut that thing off under the blood cut it off if it's not profitable if it's not like god cut it off you got the war against that thing if you got issues in your life that you talk a lot and you get high tempered you got to pray on that thing lord break it i want your spirit i want your character i want to be more like jesus more and more and more and more i want to be like him i can't be like the promise no no no no no i understand when you understand the family you understand the good there is good and there is bad but i want to dwell on the good the bad i i don't need that you know because it's not going to profit me see we all want uh uh to be possible we want to learn that how i can walk in victory how i can walk into humbleness and in the spirit of god and that takes prayer prayer the only thing can break it we've got to uh uh make ourselves fight our way and get somewhere along with god amen that's the only way i say prayer is the most powerful weapon that we ever have not really not singing not preaching but praying pray always without ceasing praying in the morning praying at noon praying at night pray when you don't feel like it that's the best time to pray that's the hardest thing christians most don't have no problem with anything else but when they come prayer lord have mercy and the devil know it as long as he keep you can talk so god says we can talk too much we can we can sing too much and we can preach too much but you never can pray too much i remember the time that uh brother sibling was involved in in the time that you know you should do whatever so often you know we sing sing sing and one time every time that he shut it down no more singing 30 days we're gonna just pray i'm gonna come out and preach no singing any comment no song service just praying and then the word but let me tell you something something happened it calls us when we did went back to saying it gave us something to sing about because something had developed and i understand now that he was trying to get the people to a mold that let's pray more than anything you know if we can pray more everything else will work out but prayer breaks you into a mode you know of you calling on god and laying your petition and and not looking wrong with everybody else doing god going but lord it's me that's where the trouble at lord it's not my wife or my husband or children lord but it probably is with me and we know that we are the worst enemy there is no other enemy you got but you and i was telling me man i said we stopped worrying about this and that focus on you and if you can put all the time on you and not look what anybody else is doing and the faults you'll find out lord i got more faults than they do and i realize that i i don't have time to you know to look and and talk no no no lord i got issues lord crucified his flesh lord fill me with love because love covers a multitude and i believe that's what we are right kid when it's the rich gender my love of god we don't see faults because all of us got that but we understand love will cover we pray one for another we pray lord bless my sister bless my brother lord bring him out of that situation that's what love does but if there ain't no love there we help kill them then we want to i wonder what happened not love well it displayed i'm gonna go to one place talking about positive the book of numbers and i made this paraphrase most of it but i thought about this in dealing with the numbers of these 20 23. if that's what i want i'm not sure yet well that's one the story though it says the numbers are 23 and 19 it said god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent have he said and shall he not do it or has he spoken and shall he not make it good see god is able to make every promise good what i was thinking about the story i'm not going to go to it but to see numbers also dealing with you know the 10 spies that god told moses sent them out to he gave them a land and he multiples that get 10 spies and let them go and spot some moses uh you know had 10 spies that went out and and talking about the land and how good it is and who all was in the land and how good the land was and these spies went out you know to see and then they all had to bring back a report and we know the story that how that eight of them brought back a year report but why they were looking at what was in the lane they would not considering that god said it's ours but joshua and caleb said they had another spirit they wasn't looking at the giants they were looking at all those walls and yes the people were big but to joshua and caleb that's nothing because god said it's ours so i mean when they brought that report to moses are more than this until men and the bible said when they got that evil report they said the people feared came over the whole congregation but then joshua and caleb said wait a minute they had to try to quiet the people down and say wait a minute god said the land was ours it didn't matter who was there it didn't matter what was there only one thing they knew god said so they were positive in the midst of the giants you have to be positive in the midst of your giant [Music] yes giants will come but like like like david i like that davis david told that philistine yeah you come boasting me with a sword and all but i'll come to you in the name of the lord i'm gonna take your head off yeah david was no match you will know back for the devil no we can't not in ourselves but the bible said greater greater is he that is in who you you greater is he and that greater that is in you is able to take everything through christ that's why we don't rely upon ourselves that's why we don't look to any of our uh kind of how strong or smart we can be come on the devil are tell us apart but we understand this as long as i stay with king jesus as long as you stay fortified behind the word you can't lose how can you he's the greatest of battle axe i know of there has never been one time he ever lost the battle but he conquered it all for you and for me god bless you tonight [Applause] [Music] [Music] we thank the lord amen god is good we appreciate everyone the pressure we are tonight amen we look to the heels from whence coming to our help amen for our help coming from the lord amen we let everyone understand appreciate the word tonight god is good amen i have to have a positive confession call those things to be not as though they are amen looking to the unseen listen to the prophet today he said be certain of god be certain amen you must have your own personal as brother jeremiah said you must have your own personal revelation you must be per personally certain of god amen you must know god for yourself amen you cannot depend on others knowing god you must have your own personal experience brother and sister you're not gonna jump on goliath if you hadn't met the bear you got to be meet the bear in the lion before you get to goliath are you with me step by step amen little by little i said little by little amen praise god he shall prosper you amen so thank god for the little that god is doing in your life and you know learn about little amen you gonna amen drive out all the enemies amen it looks like amen but little by little praise god hallelujah you got to have those build on your experiences build on the things that god have done already in your life if he saved me amen then what else has he already done he's already healed me amen i'm saved because of god's grace and mercy i'm healed because god already purchased paid the price so i got to keep on reminding myself because the devil ain't made a cut he tried to make you out of liar now you got to make up in your mind who's telling the lie amen are you lying on the devil line god god cannot lie amen so the word is right praise god amen the devil trying to make you out of a liar but you got to make the devil out of a liar amen you got to let the devil know amen i believe god's word and i'm trusting in god's word god bless you let us bow father in jesus name you're the same god today as you were yesterday god none of your word will fall to the ground all the promises in god christ is yea and not nay lord as we look to you tonight if there's one that have a need lord in the body may you touch them now there's one that's not saved lord you said amen it's already done 2 000 years ago when you died and shed your blood it was already done before the foundation of the world the lamb was already slain in the mind of god all we got to do is receive what you've already done receive our salvation receive our healing whatever the need is for father you conquered death hell and the grace father god all take the possible to them that i believe and to them that will receive it lord that all things are possible oh god we believe today we oh god reach out and faith god
