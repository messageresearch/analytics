[24:18] we were ministering on Friday night the
[24:22] created power of the word of God God
[24:26] word has power to create we understand
[24:31] and Hebrews by faith we understand that
[24:34] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[24:38] God the Bible says in Genesis warn in
[24:41] the beginning God created the heaven and
[24:43] earth and then the Bible says in the
[24:47] beginning in Saint John 1 in the
[24:49] beginning was the word the Word was with
[24:52] God and the Word was God God said in
[24:57] Genesis and let there be light and there
[24:59] was light
[25:00] I want you to know that it tooks the
[25:03] Word of God to create the world and I as
[25:09] we look this morning at Colossians 1
[25:14] again what God created in Genesis a
[25:19] world that was free of sin and sickness
[25:22] and chaos God began to recreate with his
[25:30] second item which what the Lord Jesus he
[25:35] began to recreate they met a man in His
[25:39] image and in his likeness and God
[25:45] introduced us to a new
[25:49] but it was they invisible God bringing
[25:57] the people to see the invisible so this
[26:03] morning as we look at the Creator we
[26:08] want to talk to you this morning concern
[26:11] seeing the invisible God of seeing the
[26:17] invisible Colossians 1 and 12 that reads
[26:26] giving thanks unto God giving thanks
[26:31] unto the Father which has made us meet
[26:34] to be partakers I want you to know that
[26:39] your paw take us you're part of this
[26:42] that's happening in this generation and
[26:45] in the world in the dot would you happen
[26:48] by then your particles now the
[26:55] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[27:00] has delivered us from the power of
[27:03] darkness and hath translated us into the
[27:07] kingdom of his dear son seeing the
[27:12] invisible that God blessed arena much
[27:16] worried
[27:18] but as I continue on I want you to
[27:22] understand the Wow cannot see God in it
[27:30] because he is the invisible God but you
[27:35] and I will worship God because we're
[27:40] looking until they I'd seen for it takes
[27:46] a faith to see God without faith you
[27:52] cannot see or you cannot understand God
[27:57] and John said it
[28:00] and is born again he cannot see I
[28:05] understand the kingdom of God the
[28:10] kingdom of God that you are particles
[28:14] are inherent his love that kingdom
[28:18] rather sister friends then seeing the
[28:25] invisible God is translated you and I
[28:32] and you might use the five senses he
[28:39] retains feel and so forth but we are
[28:43] talking about children that are on the
[28:48] sixth sense with all the faith seed of
[28:53] Abraham we're talking about children of
[28:58] faith that have entered into another
[29:02] dimension will entered into in the
[29:07] Noctis world but the kingdom of God that
[29:12] took the sixth sense to bring you into
[29:17] revelation and manifestation that God
[29:22] can vindicate who you are brother and
[29:27] sister your children from above you've
[29:32] been back from another world
[29:35] you've been back from heaven you are the
[29:40] children of the invisible God Paul Paul
[29:47] talks about it in Marcille he said
[29:51] unknown God he talked about they were
[29:55] easily a washer in him we live we move
[30:00] and we have our beads and he said
[30:04] because brethren I mean I want you to
[30:07] know that you are the upstream of that
[30:10] God
[30:11] that's invisible you are children of God
[30:22] here we says in the 14 verse and whom we
[30:27] have redemption through his blood even
[30:32] the forgiveness of sin hallelujah we
[30:38] have redemption through the blood of
[30:41] Jesus God had to redeem us back back to
[30:51] God but his image back to back knees
[30:57] back to God seeing the invisible brother
[31:03] sister who is the image running sister
[31:10] this is what Jesus the Bible say who is
[31:14] the image of the invisible God don't
[31:25] sound reasonable to man he meant the man
[31:29] cannot see the wind but they cannot see
[31:34] the effects of the wind when you see the
[31:40] trees MN o being tossed to and fro
[31:46] because the wind is blowing but I can't
[31:51] see the win but he win but the children
[32:04] of God to see because God had me
[32:11] provision for you and I that we might
[32:16] see the invisible God he said the
[32:22] firstborn
[32:24] of any creature for by him all things
[32:30] all things created that are in heaven
[32:35] and that are in earth visible and
[32:38] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[32:41] dominions or principalities or powers
[32:45] all things were created by him amen and
[32:53] for him so by him all things and he is
[33:00] before all things and by him all things
[33:05] consist of the body the church the
[33:14] church is the mystical body of Jesus
[33:19] Christ how can this be that detaches the
[33:26] mystical body of Christ if it's a
[33:29] mystery it was a mystery that God was in
[33:34] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[33:39] it's a mystery the crisis in Utah and
[33:45] healed the hope of glory he's hid in
[33:52] [Music]
[33:54] what he said we have this project I'm a
[34:01] gospel be hid
[34:03] it's here to do that allows and whom the
[34:07] god of this world has blinded the minds
[34:11] of them that believe not believe that
[34:16] see when you believe you can look to not
[34:22] see you can see the glory of God you can
[34:28] enter into the kingdom of God the
[34:31] kingdom of God is for believers for
[34:35] though they were take home
[34:37] the faith it's a god I believe that you
[34:41] all for he that cometh to God must
[34:44] believe that he is and that he is a
[34:49] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[34:52] Him see evil oh why he may be found call

[35:17] body the church who is the image who is
[35:22] the beginning the firstborn from the
[35:25] dead that in all things he might have
[35:30] the preeminence some folks don't want
[35:34] God to have preeminence in their life I
[35:39] said let God if you only recognize who
[35:44] he is you must let the word of God have
[35:48] the preeminence in your life amen
[35:52] you must extreme God as you hate because
[35:57] he is the head of the body the church
[35:59] and you must give him that respect and
[36:04] that reverence that I'm not my own head
