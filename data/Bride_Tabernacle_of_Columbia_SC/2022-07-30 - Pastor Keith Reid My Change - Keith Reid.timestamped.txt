[1:11:14] we read from luke that we go to saint
[1:11:16] john chapter 4.
[1:11:19] so verse 16 says
[1:11:21] and he came to nazareth where he was
[1:11:24] brought up and as his custom was
[1:11:28] he went into the synagogue and the
[1:11:30] sabbath day
[1:11:31] and stood up for to read
[1:11:34] and there was delivered unto him
[1:11:36] the book of
[1:11:37] the prophet
[1:11:38] isaiah and when he had opened the book
[1:11:41] he found the place where it was written
[1:11:45] there was a word for a day
[1:11:48] so you found the word for that day
[1:11:52] i would to god we'll find the mind of
[1:11:54] god for today
[1:11:56] hallelujah
[1:11:58] and this the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:12:01] me
[1:12:02] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:12:05] gospel to the poor
[1:12:08] he has sent me to heal up the
[1:12:10] brokenhearted
[1:12:12] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:12:15] the recovering of the sight of the blind
[1:12:18] to set at liberty
[1:12:20] them that are bruised
[1:12:23] to preach the acceptable year
[1:12:26] of the lord
[1:12:28] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:12:31] again to the minister
[1:12:33] and he sat down
[1:12:34] and the eyes of all them that were in
[1:12:37] the synagogue were fastened on him
[1:12:41] and he began to say unto them
[1:12:44] this day
[1:12:46] today
[1:12:47] is this scripture fulfilled in
[1:12:51] your
[1:12:52] years
[1:12:54] then we turn over to saint john
[1:12:57] chapter four
[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:06] i love the scripture
[1:13:10] in verse 22 he said
[1:13:12] you worship
[1:13:14] you know not what
[1:13:16] we know what we worship
[1:13:18] for salvation is of the jews
[1:13:22] but the hour cometh
[1:13:25] and now is
[1:13:26] when the true worshipers shall worship
[1:13:29] the father in spirit and in truth
[1:13:34] for the father seek it such
[1:13:36] to worship him
[1:13:38] god is a spirit
[1:13:41] and they that worship him must worship
[1:13:44] him
[1:13:45] in spirit
[1:13:46] and in truth
[1:13:48] may the lord that is blessing to the
[1:13:50] reading of the word you may be seated
[1:13:54] hallelujah
[1:13:55] you know we said what kind of man is
[1:13:57] this
[1:13:58] we would like to talk about the lord
[1:14:00] jesus
[1:14:02] hallelujah
[1:14:04] you know the bible said that there was a
[1:14:06] stigma about his birth
[1:14:09] because you know
[1:14:12] they said he was virgin born
[1:14:16] but how could a woman
[1:14:19] have a child
[1:14:20] without knowing a man
[1:14:23] and so you see they they never believe
[1:14:25] it
[1:14:26] and that stigma was there
[1:14:29] that oh god that day when he come to the
[1:14:32] the synagogue
[1:14:34] hallelujah in the bible said that he
[1:14:35] took the scroll
[1:14:37] from the ends of the priests and he
[1:14:39] found the place where it was written of
[1:14:42] him

[1:29:59] out of the church

[2:03:39] any that cried out it is finished
[2:03:42] man's redemption has been paid for
[2:03:46] you don't know

[2:05:31] but if you're not sick you don't need no
[2:05:34] physician
[2:05:37] jesus said i come not to call
[2:05:40] the righteous
[2:05:43] but sinners
[2:05:45] unto
[2:05:46] repentance hallelujah
[2:05:49] but romans

[2:05:57] and come short
[2:05:59] of the glory of god
[2:06:01] brother simmons i remember when i was a
[2:06:03] sinner
[2:06:07] i remember being on my first job
[2:06:10] sitting out on the bench when i took the
[2:06:11] break
[2:06:13] and a minister come sit by me and he
[2:06:15] began to witness to me about jesus
[2:06:18] and i remember i began to tell him on my
[2:06:20] fingers as smart
[2:06:22] the things that i'd commit
[2:06:25] the things that i was wrapped up in
[2:06:27] why i can't say yes to jesus
[2:06:30] and i could look at his face and he'd
[2:06:32] look at me
[2:06:34] and i saw the look when he meant to i
[2:06:36] had
[2:06:37] no hope
[2:06:40] is that right
[2:06:42] but i tell you that day
[2:06:45] brother had a night come to jamaica and
[2:06:47] he was preaching sin
[2:06:49] and i was sitting there
[2:06:52] and i'd say oh glory
[2:06:55] all the bloody words struck my heart
[2:06:59] hallelujah
[2:07:01] and i lift my hands and with tears in my
[2:07:03] eyes
[2:07:04] i saw that i was a sinner and i needed a
[2:07:08] savior
[2:07:11] amen i tell you i said many
[2:07:14] hallelujah cards of repentance even back
[2:07:17] there in the baptist church it couldn't
[2:07:19] help me
[2:07:20] but that day
[2:07:22] oh and sin
[2:07:23] becomes real to me amen i surrender my
[2:07:27] life
[2:07:28] to the lord jesus christ i was baptized
[2:07:31] in the name of the lord jesus even and
[2:07:34] he filled me with the holy ghost
[2:07:36] i'm never the same again
[2:07:44] but brother brooks
[2:07:45] there were times when i tried to
[2:07:47] remember
[2:07:49] what was it
[2:07:51] that i told that man that day
[2:07:54] and i can't remember the first thing
[2:07:57] you see jesus
[2:08:00] he took my sin
[2:08:02] i don't know about you tonight
[2:08:04] but jesus
[2:08:06] when he saved me
[2:08:08] it took my sin
[2:08:10] and he put them
[2:08:12] in the sea
[2:08:13] of forgetfulness
[2:08:20] i don't know somebody
[2:08:22] that knew me back then i remember
[2:08:25] but i thank god
[2:08:27] he don't remember
[2:08:28] and i don't remember
[2:08:32] all that i can remember
[2:08:35] his calvary
[2:08:37] calvary
[2:08:39] calvary
[2:08:41] and the shed blood
[2:08:42] of the lamb that was shed for me
[2:08:45] he will not tell you
[2:08:47] the bible said for the wages
[2:08:50] of sin
[2:08:52] brother keith you're going to make it
[2:08:53] that simple sure
[2:08:59] maybe tomorrow i preach on the opening
[2:09:01] of the word
[2:09:02] the seventh seal and the third pull
[2:09:05] but tonight
[2:09:07] i just want to preach
[2:09:09] repentance
[2:09:13] sometimes we've been in church for so
[2:09:15] long
[2:09:16] your backslid many years and you're
[2:09:18] still there
[2:09:21] hallelujah
[2:09:23] and you begin to tell yourself that
[2:09:25] everything is all right
[2:09:27] but deep down inside of you you know
[2:09:30] it's not all right
[2:09:32] because you're there in the church but
[2:09:35] you're backslidden
[2:09:37] and nobody knows about it but i tell you
[2:09:40] tonight jesus
[2:09:42] he knows about it
[2:09:48] you don't have to tell anybody to that
[2:09:52] but jesus knows
[2:09:54] he knows all about your troubles
[2:09:58] he knows that not when the tears were on
[2:10:01] your pillow
[2:10:02] amen because you're suffering in pain
[2:10:05] hallelujah sometimes it's not physical
[2:10:07] pain but emotional pain you're suffering
[2:10:12] you're suffering because you're in a
[2:10:14] home where things are not right but on
[2:10:17] the outside everybody think that it's
[2:10:19] all right
[2:10:20] amen i've seen families suffer amen i
[2:10:23] see all glory to god the evil that men
[2:10:27] do
[2:10:28] even when you have children that are
[2:10:30] molested
[2:10:32] and you're covering the wrong
[2:10:34] because you're trying to protect
[2:10:37] him in the family name aiming of what
[2:10:40] pastor did came into your daughter and
[2:10:43] to your son amen but i'll tell you
[2:10:45] tonight the blood of jesus christ can
[2:10:49] re-rock your life
[2:10:53] i come to tell you tonight
[2:10:55] that jesus knows her aim and the pain
[2:10:59] that you've suffered hallelujah the
[2:11:01] problems you have i mean deep down maybe
[2:11:05] because what people see on the outside
[2:11:07] maybe they think that everything is all
[2:11:09] right anybody if they should know her
[2:11:12] even i said if your heart amen was a
[2:11:15] window
[2:11:16] that they could look through
[2:11:18] they would see the pain
[2:11:20] and the scars are aiming at your face
[2:11:23] but i'll tell you tonight hallelujah
[2:11:25] tonight is a night for your change
[2:11:34] jesus
[2:11:36] i would to god
[2:11:38] that my yesterday
[2:11:40] i could forget about it
[2:11:45] because the devil remind you
[2:11:48] every day
[2:11:49] and every time you try to step up
[2:11:52] it remind you
[2:11:54] of your yesterday
[2:11:56] but i tell you tonight
[2:11:58] jesus christ
[2:12:00] he come to set
[2:12:02] the captive
[2:12:04] free hallelujah
[2:12:11] i remember i preached back in our church
[2:12:15] about the scars
[2:12:17] that men have in their lives
[2:12:20] that women have in their lives
[2:12:23] people were molested
[2:12:25] in the home a family member
[2:12:28] you've got to keep that a secret
[2:12:30] they said for the pride of the family
[2:12:34] and you can't talk about it but every
[2:12:36] time you try to move forward the old
[2:12:38] devil tells you
[2:12:40] you're there at the altar and you're
[2:12:41] holding up your hands and he reminds you
[2:12:44] and you can't praise god
[2:12:46] but i tell you tonight
[2:12:48] the blood of jesus christ
[2:12:50] speak
[2:12:51] and rewrite that wrong
[2:12:53] in your life
[2:12:56] you can tell the devil tonight satan
[2:13:00] you can hold me captive
[2:13:03] for one more
[2:13:05] day
[2:13:07] for the time of that change
[2:13:11] has come
[2:13:16] and your greatest enemy
[2:13:19] is your pride
[2:13:22] oh brother keith if i go there
[2:13:25] the preacher would want to know
[2:13:28] the ministers would want to know
[2:13:30] and we'll have to expose but let me tell
[2:13:32] you this
[2:13:33] any demon
[2:13:36] that you're keeping secret
[2:13:39] is going to keep living
[2:13:41] and surviving
[2:13:47] because he knows
[2:13:49] that you love him
[2:13:52] but if you let him go
[2:13:55] young man
[2:13:57] spirit of lust that is on you
[2:14:00] and you try to live a christian life
[2:14:03] but you can't get that spirit
[2:14:05] off of you
[2:14:08] young women
[2:14:10] you can't bring your body
[2:14:12] on the subjection to the word of god
[2:14:16] because it seems like
[2:14:18] there's a demon that it lets loose on
[2:14:21] your life
[2:14:23] you see we got to pray for our young
[2:14:24] people because the music of today
[2:14:29] it's got a spirit
[2:14:31] and an anointing
[2:14:34] hallelujah
[2:14:36] and i'll tell you what you need
[2:14:38] is deliverance
[2:14:41] and jesus is here tonight
[2:14:44] to deliver you
[2:14:45] of every demon and power
[2:14:48] that bind you
[2:14:53] resist the devil
[2:14:55] and he will flee from you
[2:14:58] that spirit of loss
[2:15:02] is just a demon
[2:15:05] and if you expose him
[2:15:07] he will go
[2:15:09] you believe that tonight
[2:15:13] the spirit of witchcraft
[2:15:16] oh hallelujah
[2:15:18] that spirit of hate
[2:15:20] that is inside of you
[2:15:22] that you battle your fat and it's still
[2:15:25] there
[2:15:26] tonight is you're not
[2:15:29] you've got to come to the point
[2:15:31] to say today is my day
[2:15:38] and as i close the night
[2:15:40] the woman with the issue of blood
[2:15:43] oh my brother preacher
[2:15:45] said for 12 long years
[2:15:48] she carried that spirit
[2:15:53] hallelujah
