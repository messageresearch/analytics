on and we were talking on last week it said change your mind but we're talking about a new mind God it's giving you an IRA a new mind what's our minds were corrupt but now God has given us a mind to please God Ephesians six and 10 we want to talk about the greatest battle ever fought the power says here feeding six and ten finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand out for heaven your lungs girded about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith wherever you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints God lesterenanne of his word in Jesus name the day we want to continue with the message Kadir dealing with the mind and the greatest battle ever fought subtopic control control we realized that there's a battle for power control I'll deal with control as we talked about the battle we talked about the battle that we you and I are facing for yes there is a wall that's taken place that wall Amen you cannot achieve each and every one of us oh we're in a battle and we got to fight in order to survive but you must make up in your mind whose side are you on you must make in your mind and it is searched that you would all have to make whose side am I on I want to ask you a question we're talking about control I want you to think about your life the life that you're not living who's in control but we understand that there's two piles first of all let me talk about control for a minute the definition of control is to have power a ruling of ruling guiding managing to hold back as to control your temper so lose control in your life but what's control in your life for we might mind you but there are many folks today of being controlled by drugs and substance they have lost the ability to function because they're being controlled by alcohol and drugs so who's in control of your life or what's in control greatest battle ever fought there must be a better ground when we are fighting the war there must be a place that the two opposites meet to fight and I said there are only two powers that we are talking about everything else is minor there is Satan and as God there is the power of life and the power of death day is a battle they talked about one of the horse riders riding in the book of Revelation and they talk about different hail was riding in knowledge that's one of the seals and we realized that death and hell riding global communities to our city to our country to the world to powell's not a pattern for control the battleground is and who controls the mind controls the individual and I want you to understand that when something has its controlling you that means that thing or that individual that power embed rules and reigns in your life the Bible tells us in 1st Peter 5 for speed of 5 here it tells us in each the verse 8 first 1st Peter 5 in verse 8 he says be sober be villager because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour the Bible tells us in st. John 10 and 10 he said I come amen Jesus come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly he said but I want you to know that the devil amen he comes amen you have something to fight with weapons in God oh yes brother sisters God is training us giving us the weapon to fight wilt he meant said the weapons of our warfare they're not carnal but they're mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds yes the devil may have build a stronghold but the weapons of our warfare they pour down to lose they cast down imaginations that exert itself against the knowledge of God God what the Word of God the sword of the Spirit they had the Word of God hallelujah salvation the shame of faith we our walls the fight look like oh wow why are you fighting well yes we are about we must wall Satan cease he's trying to devour but the Bible tells us and Peter here in the ninth verse he said whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that I into Isle amen but the God of all Greece who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that year of work suffer who we might suffer a little while free Oh somebody call him - undefeated champion never lost the battle he is all back that we can trust and depend on him God when you make the right decision when you make the right choice the right side somebody said the right side oh Jesus master our stands will Jesus come in the night but joy comes in the morning don't be all right God is gonna fetch it here second fire don't worry but your faith in God the battle is region we have battles that take place in our body for their five senses that we have to contend with and those five cents a sight smell hearing taste and touch we have to contend with those five senses and then that's it our bodies to contact the earth and the call to room they met but Satan decide that you make a decision that is going to be let's go back have it in your body st. wants to control your body because your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost so he walked through these five senses to try to control your body do the deed he'll make you see things that he wants you to see he wants to show you those things he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world it is you by God and why should be I'll give it to you oh yes that was a wall gone oh nothing after Jesus had fasted forty days and forty nights after a detector came to tip him if he tempted Jesus what about you and I well yes but he was no match for the captain of our salvation he was made perfect tipton at all ports not as we what God is evil come on victoriously hallelujah if he came then he'll come out victory and more than a conquerer in your life they met the thief comes to kill steal and destroy but jesus said I'll come that you might have a life and that you might have it more abundantly amen Jesus wants to give a life but the devil Satan wants to give you death amen but you got to make a decision what looks like he meant joy and pleasure now there's only working death out in they met in one day at the end of the road the decision that you made they Mendte you have to even have the final judgement whether your soul will be Laos or what are you going to be with the law I'm saying brother sister showdown time it's coming decision that you make you gonna be tested and try and see whether or not you committed Amen what a knot it was staying late have you committed of to the load and you've accepted him and you know that he's Savior and you know that he's God and you know that he's able he's able to keep back what you have committed into him against that day I persuaded that neither life nor principalities nor powers I don't care what comes up or what goals separate me from the love the law your stand for the law I know you're gonna be tempted and I know you will be you got to make up in your mind you got to love God more than everything the devil is offering they murder the pleasures of Siena is only for season the devil is only gonna lies just a little while but what God is giving you eternal weight of glory can't stop God to love praise God destroy this body and wait on God to stop what we don't tell them that would hold out that will keep fighting I felt a good fun yes I give up I kept oppression oppression no surprise tada brother sister stand the price don't give me don't let the devil tell my away from the promises of God Amen away from the blessings that God had in store for them that love him if you keep all Prosser God got him something better waiting on you waiting on you and off stay in the press I said stay in the press he meant somebody said it's hot this morning but you made it this long you made it this morning it's hot outside but all time it Bishop says it's hotter than that in hell but thank God you made it I'm gonna see your effort God see what you're going to God he knows how he said whatever right I'm a pea for being in the Sun for all your tone if I keep pressing on gagana a prize at the end of the road there is a prize that God has with him that wins those that will not give up those that would keep the fight though that would not turn back to the world but those that would say Lord I mean it all the way control you might let God control a little bit of your life but I want you to know a little bit a little blessing but if you let have control to control when God is in total control go with him all the way because I know I'm gonna be alright brother Matt sad because God is in control [Music] I'll go in the fire because I know it'll be alright because I got to fight understand like shot right I got to stand like me shot I gotta stop indigo I'll go in the fire yes brother sister don't try to get around - Lee what you got to go to because God got a blessing keep let it be in control they may give it in preeminence I want to say brother Copeland get me a song ready because I'm gonna come to conclusion I'm not gonna hold you in the heat but by the grace of God musicians can come god is good imagine we're looking to a faithful God faithful God that promise cement if you make the right decision God got so many blessings that he wants to bestow upon our lives but what happened in spirit rim there's imagination as consciousness memory reasoning and affection sometimes Amen I was praying and I said it's so many people they didn't get caught up and looking back soldier kid somebody said God can't use and he don't want no cow of soldier I don't want you to look back so the devil want you to look behind you amen the doctor trouble what the children of Egypt children of God coming out of Egypt they look behind them and they saw the enemies you might look behind you and you look at your pass and your path is trying to pull you back but God said don't look back I want you to get out of Sodom and I want you to get out Gomorrah and I said don't look back God when just train he put on the whole armor god he didn't give you nothing from you for your back the reason our Sano many time he said I got your back toe don't worry about what's behind you I'll take care of that though
