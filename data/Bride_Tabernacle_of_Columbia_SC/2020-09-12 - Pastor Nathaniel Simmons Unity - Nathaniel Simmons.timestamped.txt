[1:10:53] you got
[1:10:55] a lot to say
[1:10:57] this ain't doing that you do it
[1:11:01] since you see everything
[1:11:04] is that all right
[1:11:06] we have a pastor to do it that way
[1:11:10] the man
[1:11:11] can't do no more god sure

[1:11:55] problems
[1:11:57] i gave up probably too
[1:11:59] i just made a
[1:12:00] rough teacher here
[1:12:04] and what you know as i got old i found
[1:12:06] that teacher was trying to help me
[1:12:10] but i didn't understand it dude
[1:12:13] that teacher was hard on me for a reason
[1:12:16] she knew i could do better
[1:12:19] she tried to do everything she could for
[1:12:22] me
[1:12:22] but when i got to the 8th grade
[1:12:25] i changed my way
[1:12:27] i changed the way i thought about a lot
[1:12:29] of things
[1:12:30] in the end of the year
[1:12:32] i was in the class of section 3
[1:12:34] something like that and the teacher she
