[33:43] amen if you have your bibles tonight
[33:46] we turn to the book of psalms a familiar
[33:48] scripture
[33:50] psalm chapter 23.
[34:14] so when you gotta say amen
[34:17] amen and it reads the lord is my
[34:20] shepherd i shall not want
[34:22] he making me to lie down in green
[34:24] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[34:27] waters
[34:28] he restoreth my soul
[34:30] he leadeth me in the path of
[34:32] righteousness for his name's sake
[34:34] yea though i walk in the through the
[34:36] valley of the shadow of death i will
[34:38] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[34:41] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[34:44] preparest a table before me in the
[34:46] presence of mine enemies thou anointed
[34:49] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[34:52] surely goodness and mercy
[34:54] shall follow me all the days of my life
[34:57] and i will dwell in the house of the
[34:58] lord forever amen god bless to read the
[35:01] word you may be seated
[35:04] amen tonight i'd like to speak on a
[35:05] little topic i entitled it never alone
[35:10] never alone and i was thinking of this
[35:12] scripture came to mind when toffee came
[35:14] and i like to come down and
[35:17] in verse 4 it said yea though i walk
[35:20] through the valley of the shadow of
[35:22] death i will fear no evil
[35:24] amen just understanding that david here
[35:27] i can imagine
[35:29] he was a shepherd and he had to go
[35:30] through some dark valleys
[35:32] he had to go down some paths that wasn't
[35:34] always straight he had to go down some
[35:37] dangerous things to rescue his sheep but
[35:40] through all of that god was always with
[35:42] him
[35:42] he get always trusting in the fact that
[35:44] god was with him and he was never alone
[35:47] even though there might not have been a
[35:49] human in sight he was never alone god
[35:51] was always with him in this scripture he
[35:54] said he said yay though i walk through
[35:57] the valley of the shadow of death i will
[35:59] fear no evil for thou art with me see he
[36:02] god was with him and just made me
[36:04] realize even through life you go through
[36:06] valleys
[36:07] you go through valleys where you where
[36:09] you're up sometime and then there's some
[36:11] real low moments and in those moments
[36:13] you have to remember that you're never
[36:14] alone he's always there with you he
[36:17] always has your hand he's guiding you
[36:19] and leading you even in the darkest
[36:21] times even when you feel like you're by
[36:23] yourself and there's nothing and you
[36:26] don't know how you're going to make it
[36:27] out those moments but god is always with
[36:30] you
[36:30] he's always there to carry you through
[36:32] even when you don't it don't seem like
[36:34] he's there he's still there listening to
[36:36] your prayers listening to you and
[36:38] hearing you and you say my prayers ain't
[36:40] getting through but god always hears
[36:42] your prayers he always when you get down
[36:44] on your knees and pray in earnest god
[36:46] always hears you he always knows what
[36:48] you're going through but he always gives
[36:50] you the ability and the tools to make it
[36:52] through what you're going through
[36:54] because he said that you're never alone
[36:56] let's turn to the book of first kings
[36:59] chapter 19. see there was someone in the
[37:01] bible it was a prophet in the bible that
[37:03] thought he was all alone
[37:05] he thought he was all alone god there
[37:08] came a persecution on the church and he
[37:10] was hiding out and
[37:12] he thought he was all alone second kings
[37:14] first kings chapter 19.
[37:24] first kings chapter 19 and verse nine
[37:32] and you gotta say man
[37:34] and he came through unto a cave and
[37:36] lodged there and behold the word of the
[37:39] lord came to him and he said unto him
[37:41] why dost thou hear elijah
[37:44] what dost thou hear elijah and he said i
[37:47] have been very jealous for the lord god
[37:49] of hosts for the children of israel have
[37:52] forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine
[37:55] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[37:57] sword and i even i
[38:00] only am left and they seek my life to
[38:03] take it away
[38:04] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[38:07] mount before the lord and behold the
[38:10] lord passed by
[38:11] in a great and strong wind rent the
[38:14] mountains and break pieces to rock
[38:16] before the lord but the lord was not in
[38:18] the wind and after after the wind an
[38:21] earthquake but the lord was not in the
[38:23] earthquake and after the earthquake of
[38:24] fire but the lord was not in the fire
[38:27] and after the fire a still small voice
[38:30] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[38:32] he wrapped his face in his mantle
[38:34] and went out and stood in the entering
[38:36] in of the cave and behold there came a
[38:38] voice unto elijah and said what dost
[38:40] i'll hear elijah
[38:42] and he said i have been very jealous for
[38:45] the for the lord god of hosts because
[38:47] the children children of israel have
[38:49] forsaken their covenant thrown down
[38:51] thine altars and slain thy prophets with
[38:54] the sword and i even i
[38:56] only am left and they seek my life to
[38:59] take it away and the lord said unto him
[39:01] go return on thy way to the wilderness
[39:03] of damascus and when thou coments anoint
[39:06] hazel to be king over syria and jehu the
[39:10] son of nemtshi
[39:12] shalt thou anoint to be king over israel
[39:15] and elijah the son of shafat of
[39:18] abel
[39:20] hola
[39:21] shalt thou anoint to be the prophet in
[39:23] thy room and it shall come to pass that
[39:25] him that escaped the sword of hazel
[39:28] shall jehu slay and him that escapes
[39:30] from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay
[39:32] yet i have left me seven thousand in
[39:36] israel all the knees which thou
[39:39] which have not bowed unto baal in every
[39:42] mouth
[39:42] which hath not kissed him
[39:45] amen we'll stop there but there was a
[39:47] key things that he said in the scripture
[39:50] elijah repeated
[39:51] multiple times he said i even i
[39:54] am left and they seek my life to take it
[39:57] away and i wrote something down i said
[39:59] the devil tries to get you isolated
[40:02] and tell you that you're the only one
[40:03] going through
[40:05] he tries to get you in a dark corner and
[40:06] say i'm the only one why me as brother
[40:09] ernest was saying the other night and
[40:12] he tries to get you all alone
[40:14] or
[40:16] make you feel like you're the only one
[40:18] that's going through the things that
[40:19] you're going through but jesus said i'll
[40:22] never leave you nor forsake you so you
[40:24] don't have to worry about being alone
[40:26] and being the only one you there's
[40:28] always someone else that's fighting the
[40:30] elijah saw that he wasn't the only one
[40:32] god had seven thousand out there but he
[40:34] seemed like he was isolated and by
[40:36] himself and so he was the only one that
[40:38] was going through but he was never alone
[40:42] there were more that was out there that
[40:44] was praying there was more that was out
[40:45] there that was living right there was
[40:47] more that was out there that was
[40:48] worshiping god and doing what god asked
[40:50] them to do they was never alone there
[40:52] was no one there was never elijah was
[40:55] never by himself but because of where he
[40:57] was standing he could only see his
[40:59] problems
[41:00] because of where he was hiding he could
[41:02] only see his circumstances he could only
[41:04] see what he was going through but he
[41:06] wasn't alone there were many out there
[41:08] that was still fighting there were many
[41:10] out there that was still progressing and
[41:12] doing the right thing and he always knew
[41:14] that god was with him
[41:16] no matter if he felt alone god was still
[41:18] there in his midst he said in matthew
[41:21] lord i will be with you
[41:22] even until the end that's the great
[41:24] commission in matthew chapter 28 see god
[41:27] said if you go
[41:28] if that he will be with you even until
[41:31] the end until the end of everything
[41:33] until the end of time he will be with
[41:35] you
[41:36] that you don't have to worry about am i
[41:38] alone am i by myself and i came to the
[41:41] second part and i said i want to ask
[41:43] everyone the question do you trust them
[41:46] do you trust him
[41:47] see many of times when you feel alone is
[41:49] because you've lost faith you've lost
[41:52] trust in something something that you
[41:54] held on to and now it's no longer on the
[41:57] level that you thought it was
[41:59] but i want to question you and ask you
[42:00] do you trust him
[42:02] because he said he would never leave you
[42:03] so do you trust him in the moments that
[42:06] you in your deepest moments do you still
[42:08] trust him when you down there and you're
[42:10] not feeling good do you still trust him
[42:12] that he's still your healer
[42:14] when you're going through mind battles
[42:15] do you still believe that he's a
[42:16] deliverer do you trust him that he will
[42:19] bring you through that you are never
[42:20] alone and he's still there fighting with
[42:22] you even in those and he can deliver you
[42:24] from anything all you have to do is pray
[42:27] and ask him lord take this away from you
[42:29] lord take this that i'm going through
[42:31] and and lord you fight this battle it's
[42:33] not mine and lord i came to the altar to
[42:36] leave it there and i didn't want to pick
[42:37] it back up
[42:38] many times i said we come to the altar
[42:40] and we leave it there but then we start
[42:42] to think about it it's brought back to
[42:44] our mind of what what it was and we
[42:47] still try to figure it out
[42:48] but sometimes you got to leave it in
[42:50] god's hand and let him work it out not
[42:52] you figure it out but let god work it
[42:54] out because you're not alone he'll fight
[42:56] you about us he didn't say you fight
[42:57] your battles he said i'll fight your
[42:59] battles but you got to give the battle
[43:01] to him
[43:02] before you before you
[43:04] you can't win the battle if you're still
[43:06] fighting but you gave it to him
[43:08] that's like you going you're fighting
[43:10] someone that's bigger and stronger so
[43:12] you go get your friend and you say hey
[43:14] you bigger than me you take my battle
[43:16] but then you still jump in the middle of
[43:18] the fight
[43:19] why would you do that when you got
[43:21] someone there that said i'll fight all
[43:23] your battles and not only that i win i
[43:26] don't ever lose i always win see you can
[43:29] know that you're never alone in the
[43:31] battles that you fight and the things
[43:33] that you go through it's just maybe your
[43:35] perspective
[43:37] it's maybe because you haven't went to
[43:38] the one and said lord do i truly trust
[43:41] you
[43:42] do i truly trust that you're going to
[43:44] work all things to my good do i truly
[43:47] trust that no matter what you working
[43:49] this out no even though i can't see how
[43:51] it's going to work out but do i trust
[43:53] you that you are going to work it out
[43:55] that you are going to see me through
[43:57] these moments that you are going to
[43:58] strengthen me in my time and need that
[44:00] you're going to provide when i need you
[44:02] to provide lord do i trust you
[44:05] that's the question do you trust him
[44:08] in proverbs it's one of my favorite
[44:09] scriptures he said trust in the lord
[44:11] with all thine heart and lean not to not
[44:14] own understanding in all thy ways
[44:15] acknowledge him and he shall direct our
[44:17] path and i always like to remember that
[44:20] scripture because it's something that
[44:22] you gotta sometimes quote daily to
[44:24] remember to remind yourself it's a daily
[44:27] reminder lord i still gotta trust you
[44:29] i may not understand how it's gonna work
[44:31] out but lord i still trust you because
[44:34] you you said in your word
[44:36] that if i lean not into all my
[44:38] understandings in all that ways
[44:40] acknowledge him and he will direct my
[44:42] path like you will do it lord not me
[44:45] not me doing it but you will do it and i
[44:48] look in the scriptures and i
[44:50] seen in luke chapter 7 there was a
[44:51] centurion
[44:53] that had a servant
[44:55] and the servant was sick
[44:56] so he went to jesus and he said
[45:00] and he said lord my servant is sick
[45:03] and jesus said well well let's go down
[45:04] to him and let's lay hands but he said
[45:07] lord i believe in you i trust you so
[45:09] much that all i need you to do is speak
[45:12] the word
[45:13] i don't need you to go there to the
[45:14] place where this where it's happening
[45:16] lord just speak the word and i believe
[45:18] that that that he will be healed
[45:20] and jesus said he spoke the word he said
[45:23] i have found no greater faith in all of
[45:25] israel see see sometimes when that was a
[45:28] trust that that centurion had in the
[45:30] word
[45:31] and sometimes god asked us to trust his
[45:33] word the same way
[45:35] you may not see or understand it but he
[45:37] said trust it
[45:38] and the centurion he trusted it that it
[45:41] was going to do what god sent it out of
[45:42] his mouth to do because it couldn't turn
[45:45] return to him boy he trusted that these
[45:47] things were going to return and now when
[45:49] he got back home that situation was
[45:51] going to be worked out that situation
[45:53] was going to be taken care of he and and
[45:56] i asked the question do you trust him on
[45:57] that level
[45:59] that when you look at your problem you
[46:01] say lord it's yours
[46:02] and then you leave it there
[46:04] do you trust him on the level that lord
[46:06] i'm not alone in this
[46:08] i'm not i'm not alone in fighting this
[46:10] battle lord you got this battle and it's
[46:12] yours and i trust you to see me through
[46:15] i don't know how it's going to work out
[46:16] how it's going to turn out but i know
[46:18] that it's going to be for my good i know
[46:20] that when you get done working it's
[46:22] going to be for my good i can step in
[46:25] and mess something up but i know that
[46:26] you're gonna work it out so it's for my
[46:28] good i can go in there and maybe say
[46:31] this and say that and turn it all the
[46:33] way around and it'd be worse than it was
[46:35] but you can turn it around for the good
[46:37] no matter how bad it looks lord i trust
[46:39] you
[46:40] i trust you to do what you said you
[46:42] would do in your word and everything
[46:44] that you said you would i can hold on to
[46:46] it the prophet of god said i can rest on
[46:48] that i can rest on these things that you
[46:51] put in your word because it's a promise
[46:52] to me it's a promise to abraham seat and
[46:55] all this the seat after it's a promise
[46:57] that you're going to do what you said
[46:58] you were going to do
[47:00] and that i can't i can't worry about how
[47:02] it's going to happen
[47:03] i can't you waste time on worrying about
[47:06] what's going to happen i got to leave it
[47:08] in your hand to say whatever happens
[47:10] it's your will
[47:12] whatever happens you meant if you meant
[47:14] it to happen whether it looks like i'm
[47:16] struggling to make it maybe those are
[47:18] the times i read something recently it
[47:20] said the days that break you are the
[47:22] days that make you
[47:24] it's the mo it's your darkest times that
[47:26] show you what your character is truly
[47:28] made of
[47:30] it's those moments where you're in the
[47:31] valleys that make you appreciate the
[47:33] mountaintop so much more when you get
[47:36] done fighting and you're on when you're
[47:38] in your lowest moments and god bring you
[47:40] through you can always look back and say
[47:42] lord you brought me through this lord
[47:44] you brought me through that and so i
[47:46] know you'll bring me through to what's
[47:47] coming next i know that you can provide
[47:50] i know that you can do these things i
[47:51] know that you're a healer cause when i
[47:52] had a cold you healed me when i got a
[47:55] little bit sicker you healed me so if
[47:57] it's something greater i know you can
[47:58] still do it because you're the god
[48:00] you're the same yesterday today and
[48:02] forever and i don't have to worry about
[48:03] what happened yesterday because i know
[48:05] that you are the able you're the god
[48:07] that always provides i can hold and hold
[48:10] on to that and i can trust in that that
[48:12] lord you able and your provider and you
[48:14] able to do what you said you wouldn't do
[48:17] see
[48:18] a lot of that's why i asked the question
[48:20] do you trust them
[48:21] and it was been the thing that god has
[48:23] been working on me you said that you you
[48:25] laid these situations in my hand
[48:28] but what level is your faith and trust
[48:30] in me
[48:32] because many times we get in life and we
[48:34] want things to happen a certain way or
[48:36] we see this path and we want it to
[48:38] happen this way
[48:41] but if it don't go that way it throws us
[48:43] off kilter it throws us all where we
[48:46] thought we was going and our
[48:47] trajectories and where we thought things
[48:49] would go in life
[48:51] but in those moments i have to remember
[48:53] lord do i trust you
[48:55] do i trust you in the moments when the
[48:57] path don't look like it's going the
[48:59] right way
[49:00] do i trust you in the moments where i
[49:02] can't tell you what's going to happen in
[49:03] the future
[49:04] when i can't see where this is going
[49:07] but do i trust you
[49:09] and know that i'm not alone that you
[49:12] promised to fight all my battles but i
[49:14] got to give them to you so and get down
[49:16] on my knees and get a get a prayer
[49:18] through to god and say lord i trust you
[49:21] i trust you to see me through i trust
[49:23] that you no matter what i'm going
[49:24] through you're going to make it through
[49:26] you're going to allow me to make it
[49:27] through and it's going to work to my
[49:28] good see you have to remember that it no
[49:31] matter what you may go through no matter
[49:33] what may be happening to you
[49:36] lord do i trust you
[49:38] do i trust you
[49:40] and remember that when the devil tries
[49:42] to defeat you further and said no i
[49:44] trust god
[49:45] when he tries to take you further into
[49:47] deeper and darker places lord i still
[49:50] trust you
[49:51] joe before it all before the sun rise
[49:54] it's always the darkest
[49:55] right before the sun rise it's always
[49:58] the darkest
[50:00] so sometimes it maybe seems like it's
[50:02] getting darker but the light is coming
[50:05] the light is right on the way but you
[50:06] got to break through so many times you
[50:09] get you get right to the edge of your
[50:11] breakthrough and never cross over
[50:13] because you say that's it
[50:15] i've taken enough
[50:16] i've been through enough i'm not going
[50:18] through no more but that was right in
[50:20] that moment was the moment that if you
[50:22] would have pushed a little further
[50:24] god was about to do great things
[50:27] god was going to do great things if you
[50:29] trusted him just a little bit more than
[50:32] where you are today
[50:33] so i asked the question to you do you
[50:35] trust him
[50:36] do you trust that you're never alone do
[50:38] you trust in the fact that lord i know
[50:40] that you're always right there beside me
[50:43] david did
[50:44] david didn't know that one day he was
[50:45] going to face goliath but the trustee he
[50:48] had in god bringing him through the
[50:49] valleys
[50:50] trust that he had in god to carry him
[50:52] through the mountain through the lion
[50:54] through the bear through through the
[50:56] lion and through the bear it was the
[50:57] same faith that he said lord i trust
[50:59] that you're gonna defeat the goliath i
[51:01] have no doubt that goliath is going to
[51:03] fall i have no doubt that lord you're
[51:05] going to destroy this this this thing
[51:08] that's in my way he had no doubt because
[51:10] he trusted him he trusted him in the
[51:12] valley he trusted him through the lion
[51:14] and the bear and now he got to goliath
[51:16] and he said i'm not worried about you
[51:18] i've seen how much god has already done
[51:21] so i can keep going and i can keep
[51:22] trusting i can keep believing because
[51:25] god has brought me too far for me to go
[51:27] back now for me to start doubting that
[51:29] lord oh i'm scared now no i ain't scared
[51:32] no more because i haven't seen how far
[51:34] that trust in you has brought me i can
[51:36] keep going i can keep believing that no
[51:38] matter what else comes in my way lord
[51:40] you're able to take me through it lord
[51:42] no matter how big he looks and how small
[51:44] i am i know that you are greater because
[51:46] i'm never alone that you will god this
[51:49] stone you will take out all the enemies
[51:51] that's in my way so i can believe in
[51:53] that and i can trust on that and then
[51:55] and david he didn't worry about goliath
[51:58] and he said no he said don't worry about
[52:00] that because i know that if goliath
[52:02] falls everyone else gonna scatter
[52:05] if i can take out goliath all the
[52:07] philistines started running because that
[52:09] was the one that was holding them
[52:10] together
[52:11] that was the one thing that was the one
[52:13] problem that had no multitude back
[52:16] behind it but when the one problem fell
[52:18] because you trusted god all the mother
[52:20] things started to move out the way
[52:22] and it was a vast you had victory over
[52:25] many different things that was in the
[52:27] way because god you could try
[52:29] you trusted him through those moments
[52:31] and god defeated goliath
[52:33] and then after that the rest of the
[52:34] philistines were yours but you have to
[52:36] defeat goliath you got to trust in god
[52:38] to defeat the goliath but god has
[52:40] brought you through things that you can
[52:42] trust in and say he brought me through
[52:44] this
[52:45] and it may seem small
[52:47] but it's just it's the small victories
[52:49] that eventually win the war
[52:51] it ain't always the massive ones it's
[52:53] the small victories you're piling on
[52:55] victories and say lord you brought me
[52:57] through this you brought me through that
[52:59] and you brought me through this and by
[53:01] the time i get done thanking you for
[53:03] what all you brought me through and what
[53:05] all you're going to do i don't even
[53:07] think about my problem because you
[53:08] brought me through so much
[53:10] you brought me through so much this that
[53:12] i can it's increasing my face to
[53:14] remember where you brought me from
[53:16] remember what you've done for me and
[53:17] it's increasing me to know that if he
[53:19] did bring me through that i might have
[53:20] forgotten about that but lord thank you
[53:22] for bringing it back to my memory that
[53:24] what you did for me yesterday you're the
[53:26] same god of yesterday
[53:28] you're the same god today and you'll be
[53:30] the same god tomorrow so if you're the
[53:32] same god i can trust you i can trust and
[53:35] believe that you're going to continue to
[53:37] deliver me you're going to continue to
[53:39] bring me through these things
[53:40] because these things take you greater
[53:42] and farther and farther in god
[53:44] that trust in him takes you further and
[53:46] further in god even further than you
[53:48] thought that you would go but god can
[53:50] take you more and take you to higher and
[53:52] deeper higher heights and deeper depths
[53:55] and that if he bought you through the
[53:56] valley yesterday he can take you through
[53:58] the valley that comes tomorrow he can
[54:00] take you through the valley that comes
[54:02] the next day because everything ain't
[54:04] always sunshine and roses
[54:07] life is full of problems but those
[54:09] things that that are problems they come
[54:11] to build your character
[54:13] they come to make you the person that
[54:15] you are today they come to make you the
[54:17] person that you will be because of those
[54:19] problems and god can use any one that he
[54:22] wants to use
[54:23] if you let him
[54:24] if you trust him and say lord things
[54:27] might have happened these things might
[54:28] have occurred and life may seem to be
[54:30] unfair
[54:32] there are moments in life that you may
[54:34] seem like why me like elijah said i'm
[54:36] the only one
[54:38] he was in his lowest moment he said i'm
[54:40] the only one but god had to remind him
[54:43] that you're not the only one that's
[54:44] fighting
[54:45] you're not the only one i said
[54:48] i said even in in the moments that when
[54:50] god drops someone on your heart
[54:52] to pray for him pray for him
[54:54] in the moments because you never know
[54:56] what a person may be going through and
[54:59] you never know who prayer is the one
[55:00] that brings them through that moment you
[55:02] never know what god is using and
[55:04] pressing on your heart to do to help
[55:06] someone else
[55:08] so those are moments i heard this story
[55:11] and i'll tell it and because it was
[55:13] really packed full and it meant
[55:14] something said there was this man he was
[55:16] traveling down he was a missionary he's
[55:18] traveling down a road and he met this
[55:20] guy
[55:21] on the road and he was sick and hurt and
[55:22] he helped him almost like a good
[55:24] samaritan and when he got done on the
[55:27] road and he went about his way well that
[55:29] night he had to sleep on the road and it
[55:30] was dangerous and there were bandits and
[55:32] stuff on the road but that night he got
[55:35] he got he got there and he slept and he
[55:37] slept safely and then he went on about
[55:40] his way to the next city
[55:41] well in the next city he got to there
[55:44] and there were and there was the man on
[55:46] the side of the road
[55:47] that he had helped and he said he came
[55:49] up to him and he said
[55:52] he said
[55:54] i just want to let you know that last
[55:55] night
[55:56] me and my friends were going to rob you
[55:59] we was going to take everything that you
[56:01] had but when we went to take up there
[56:04] we saw that there were 26
[56:07] men guards around you
[56:09] now i'm not a missionary he knew that he
[56:11] was all alone he knew that there was no
[56:14] one else out there
[56:15] so he said he questioned 26 that's an
[56:17] odd number
[56:19] and he said well he went back home and
[56:21] he made it all the way back home to the
[56:22] church and it was pressed on him and he
[56:25] told the story to the church how
[56:27] how the lord protected him on the road
[56:29] and telling the testimony and there was
[56:31] a brother that stood up in the church
[56:32] and he said pastor a mission or a
[56:35] missionary he said when did this happen
[56:37] what day what time
[56:39] and the pastor said it happened for
[56:41] example on thursday at nine o'clock
[56:43] and so he said well he said pastor i
[56:46] want to let you know a missionary i want
[56:48] to let you know that at that day and at
[56:50] that time the lord pressed on my heart
[56:52] to pray for you
[56:54] and then i called around to
[56:56] to a couple of brothers and ask them to
[56:58] pray with me
[57:00] and then sort of so the missionary as he
[57:02] said with all y'all that stood would
[57:04] stand up that prayed for him
[57:06] and then and he got around and he looked
[57:09] and a group of people stood up and he
[57:10] started counting
[57:12] and it was the exact number
[57:14] of the people that the thieves saw
[57:16] guarding him
[57:17] it was the exact same number
[57:19] it was the exact same and he said see
[57:22] god always does things for reasons
[57:24] god always has a purpose and sometimes
[57:27] he use others to show you that you're
[57:28] not alone
[57:30] he uses others to show you that you can
[57:32] still trust in him and then he allows
[57:34] you to see it
[57:35] that he's still there he's still
[57:37] watching over you he's still leading you
[57:39] he's still guiding you and it increases
[57:42] your faith every day to remember that no
[57:44] matter what you may be going through no
[57:46] matter what how you how things may be
[57:48] going in life that you can still trust
[57:50] them you can still believe that god is
[57:52] still here with me god is able to take
[57:55] me through and able to take all my
[57:57] burdens and he's able to carry me
[57:59] through whatever i may be going through
[58:01] amen
[58:16] i appreciate the word tonight
[58:18] amen never alone amen
[58:21] i just thank the lord for the word that
[58:23] we heard and
[58:24] you know it's just a blessing that i was
[58:26] sitting there and
[58:27] and he's ministering i was thinking
[58:29] about that
[58:30] footprints on the standard time
[58:33] and how you know the man said lord in
[58:35] all of my
[58:36] hardest moments in life
[58:38] said i only seen one set of footprints
[58:41] and he began to tell him
[58:43] said son that's when i was carrying you
[58:45] because you know we we feel that way
[58:48] sometimes
[58:49] until we understand who god is
[58:52] and
[58:52] and he's like he said he'll never leave
[58:54] you one thing i thought about too
[58:57] is as you know when he was talking to
[58:58] joshua knows after moses had left
[59:01] was gone he took moses off the scene one
[59:04] of the things i always looked at what he
[59:06] told him
[59:07] he said i won't fail you
[59:09] and i said there is no failure in god
[59:12] not only that he says i ain't going to
[59:14] leave you nor forsake you
[59:16] but i ain't going to fail you
[59:18] so i want you to you know put your trust
[59:20] in me and i know that you know tonight
[59:24] we trusting in god and for all things
[59:26] you know i was saying something the
[59:27] other day and when we were doing our
[59:29] studies
[59:30] and uh it's something that struck out to
[59:33] me about a lot of times we look at god
[59:35] as being the impersonal god
[59:38] i was saying that tuesday
[59:39] we look at god as being impersonal
[59:42] we just see him as the great creator
[59:45] that created the heavens and earth and
[59:47] but for some reason in our minds
[59:50] thinking that way
[59:51] he seems we push him far off from us
[59:54] this great creator he's sometimes
[59:57] unapproachable
[59:58] or sometimes he's so great
[1:00:00] that
[1:00:01] he don't have time to mingle in my
[1:00:04] matters
[1:00:05] but
[1:00:06] he is great he is the almighty god
[1:00:09] he is all-powerful that great creator
[1:00:12] but that same one i like how i believe
[1:00:15] it was john in book of
[1:00:17] first john how he says you know we heard
[1:00:19] it from the beginning we've seen it we
[1:00:21] with our own hands have we handled it
[1:00:24] because god this great creator not only
[1:00:26] is he so great but he wants to have a
[1:00:29] personal relationship with you as well
[1:00:31] he got time out of all of his greatness
[1:00:34] hallelujah to come down and see about
[1:00:36] you
[1:00:37] out all his greatness and i believe
[1:00:39] david says when i consider the heavens
[1:00:42] and the stars the work of our fingers he
[1:00:44] says what is a man that thou art that
[1:00:46] thou art mindful of him this great
[1:00:48] creator come on the one that bridged the
[1:00:51] way back
[1:00:52] to him that was closed up
[1:00:54] from sin
[1:00:55] this great creator this great savior but
[1:00:58] yet he wants to have a personal
[1:01:00] relationship with you
[1:01:02] and i said
[1:01:03] in our studies is saying you know the
[1:01:05] way we thinking that he's so far off he
[1:01:08] said that's the wrong way of thinking
[1:01:10] we got to correct that way you know when
[1:01:12] you think god is so far off that's why
[1:01:14] you don't pray as you ought to pray
[1:01:17] that's why you don't seek god's face as
[1:01:19] you ought to
[1:01:20] because sometimes you think oh he but
[1:01:22] but god cares
[1:01:24] you know you know the bible says he
[1:01:26] cares
[1:01:27] he he cares for you to cast all your
[1:01:29] cares upon the lord because he cares for
[1:01:31] you this great yes he got time to come
[1:01:34] down and get in your business
[1:01:36] he got time to come down and see about
[1:01:38] your matters
[1:01:39] but
[1:01:40] we don't we don't we our thinking is all
[1:01:42] messed up we see him too far off but
[1:01:44] when we realize
[1:01:46] that he's that same that same god
[1:01:48] remember he came down and he spoke to
[1:01:50] moses didn't he and began to tell him i
[1:01:53] hear the the cries of my people i know
[1:01:56] what they're going through
[1:01:57] i hear him crying and tell him i come
[1:02:00] down now to come see about him that
[1:02:02] great creator yes he got time to come
[1:02:05] down and see about you that same one he
[1:02:07] had time to come in the cooler day
[1:02:09] hallelujah and go talk to abraham i said
[1:02:13] we got to start looking at god as not
[1:02:15] being unapproachable or impersonal but
[1:02:17] being a personal god
[1:02:19] that when you get down lord i need your
[1:02:22] help too
[1:02:23] god i got these struggles i got these
[1:02:26] battles i got these trials
[1:02:27] and lord i need your help
[1:02:30] god you're that same god i know you're
[1:02:32] powerful
[1:02:33] i know that you're still a creator
[1:02:35] you're still a deliverer and a healer
[1:02:38] where is this great god come on if god
[1:02:41] be god and where is all his miracles
[1:02:43] that we heard about sometimes you know
[1:02:45] you find that he's a personal god you
[1:02:48] approach him in that way come on i
[1:02:49] remember many times people talk to me
[1:02:52] and maybe dump all their problems off on
[1:02:54] me
[1:02:55] like
[1:02:55] say hey this is what i'm going through
[1:02:58] so when i let them vent what they call
[1:03:00] it but when they get done i said not the
[1:03:03] same way you talked to me don't you know
[1:03:05] god heard it
[1:03:06] but i can't do nothing for you but pray
[1:03:09] with you i said you got to get down on
[1:03:11] your knees
[1:03:12] for yourself
[1:03:13] and the same way you talk to me you felt
[1:03:16] confident in me because you thinking
[1:03:18] that i'm somebody that you can talk to i
[1:03:20] say don't you know god is somebody that
[1:03:21] you can talk to
[1:03:23] god is somebody that you can walk in the
[1:03:25] day with come on not just just say at
[1:03:27] certain times but everywhere you go
[1:03:29] don't you know god is somebody that you
[1:03:31] can talk to
[1:03:32] god is somebody you can confide in and
[1:03:34] ask
[1:03:35] god what's your will in this situation
[1:03:37] god how you want me to move as we were
[1:03:39] saying last week did you pray about it i
[1:03:42] said many times people don't pray
[1:03:44] because they're afraid of the answer
[1:03:46] that god gonna give
[1:03:48] they don't want the answer that god
[1:03:49] gonna give them
[1:03:51] i said
[1:03:52] many times
[1:03:53] people
[1:03:54] today they fall in love with the very
[1:03:56] things that they know destroy many men
[1:04:00] or women
[1:04:01] or preachers or whatever
[1:04:04] they fall in love still with those
[1:04:06] things
[1:04:07] because they can't help themselves
[1:04:09] it's in their nature
[1:04:11] to seek out the carnal things
[1:04:13] to their own destruction
[1:04:15] so that's why we we pray and we say god
[1:04:19] thank you for giving us a new nature
[1:04:22] and the new nature is going to seek you
[1:04:23] out to the things of god
[1:04:25] not the things of the world not the
[1:04:27] things that destroy men
[1:04:29] even in your flesh when it rise up that
[1:04:31] nature that's inside you will be quick
[1:04:33] to find somewhere to get along with god
[1:04:36] and say god ridden me of these thoughts
[1:04:39] ridden me of these desires come on i
[1:04:41] don't have the will to fight myself
[1:04:44] but not my will lord but let thy will be
[1:04:47] done you know when jesus in the garden
[1:04:49] of gethsemane he said lord if it be
[1:04:51] possible let this cup pass because it
[1:04:54] was a real hard trial that he had to
[1:04:57] face
[1:04:58] but then he begins to say lord not my
[1:05:00] will but let thy will be done come on
[1:05:02] and that's what we want
[1:05:04] in our lives god's will to be done you
[1:05:08] know the bible says our brother caleb
[1:05:10] read it trust in the lord with all thine
[1:05:12] heart and lean not to that own
[1:05:14] understanding but in all thy ways
[1:05:17] acknowledge him and he gonna direct your
[1:05:20] paths
[1:05:21] you know did you pray about it
[1:05:22] hallelujah
[1:05:23] because he gonna direct your paths and
[1:05:25] all your ways acknowledge him now
[1:05:28] because many times we made major
[1:05:30] decisions and we didn't pray about it
[1:05:32] we didn't ask god about it because it's
[1:05:35] what we wanted what we desired was
[1:05:36] afraid of what his answer was going to
[1:05:38] be
[1:05:39] but if we'd only asked god about it
[1:05:41] come on then god could have led us in
[1:05:43] the ways that he won't and that's what
[1:05:45] it is i was saying uh last week i said
[1:05:48] the thing is you keep doing those things
[1:05:51] and i said sooner or later you'll get
[1:05:53] yourself in the place the way you ain't
[1:05:54] gonna come back from
[1:05:57] that same hard or sad ain't it but it's
[1:06:00] the truth anyhow
[1:06:02] why because why would we venture out on
[1:06:04] our own when we got somebody that can
[1:06:06] lead us away
[1:06:09] oh we like sheep the bible say have gone
[1:06:11] astray
[1:06:12] come on
[1:06:13] but yet we got a shepherd that calls us
[1:06:15] by name
[1:06:16] you know the bible said a good shepherd
[1:06:18] know the sheep he know him by name come
[1:06:20] on and he calleth them out the bible say
[1:06:23] he called them and he leadeth them out
[1:06:25] jesus said that and i like that
[1:06:28] hallelujah don't you ain't you glad
[1:06:30] tonight to know that god knows your name
[1:06:32] you know out of all the world that's why
[1:06:35] i said he's not some unapproachable god
[1:06:37] out all the world you know he'll turn
[1:06:39] the world upside down because he knows
[1:06:41] you
[1:06:43] you were ordained you were elected of
[1:06:45] god
[1:06:46] so he changed the course of history i
[1:06:48] believe that
[1:06:50] just to save you
[1:06:52] he'll stop the hand of judgment
[1:06:55] when the devil want to cut your life off
[1:06:57] because you deserve to be cut off but
[1:06:59] yet you were the elect of god and god
[1:07:02] knew
[1:07:03] that one day you'll hear his voice
[1:07:06] one day when he called you would answer
[1:07:09] so he held back the winds hallelujah he
[1:07:12] held back the storms
[1:07:15] because i got a child in there
[1:07:17] he came down to see about you didn't he
[1:07:19] you know
[1:07:20] i look at my life that way
[1:07:22] god
[1:07:23] came to see about me
[1:07:25] i was never alone as brother caleb said
[1:07:28] you were never alone god came to see
[1:07:30] about me
[1:07:31] one of my
[1:07:32] somebody told me once
[1:07:33] man
[1:07:34] when you left everything fell apart
[1:07:37] but you know what
[1:07:38] god came to see about me
[1:07:41] god was with me the whole time don't you
[1:07:43] know god was there the whole time
[1:07:46] waiting
[1:07:47] for you to call on him waiting in line
[1:07:49] do y'all believe that tonight
[1:07:51] i thank god i says that i wrote
[1:07:53] something down i said
[1:07:54] if we only knew
[1:07:56] how much he cares
[1:07:59] if you only knew
[1:08:00] how much god cares
[1:08:02] you have not because your ass not
[1:08:05] come on
[1:08:06] you know i was say this and i'll sit
[1:08:09] down about this little story one time
[1:08:11] and how did the guy say
[1:08:14] you know we got up to heaven and they
[1:08:16] had all these little warehouses just
[1:08:17] telling a story and says that
[1:08:20] you know
[1:08:21] he
[1:08:22] found one room or a house or something
[1:08:24] in the warehouse and had all these gifts
[1:08:26] in it
[1:08:27] and he and the boxes had his name on it
[1:08:29] or so however he tell it and he said
[1:08:31] lord what are these
[1:08:33] he said these are the blessings that god
[1:08:35] had in store for you while you was on
[1:08:37] earth but you never asked for them
[1:08:39] you know
[1:08:40] and i said a lot of times god don't you
[1:08:42] know god i want to give you exceeding
[1:08:44] abundantly above all you can ask or
[1:08:46] think
[1:08:47] he owned every cattle on the hill don't
[1:08:49] he
[1:08:50] but sometimes you got to go to guard and
[1:08:52] ask god about it how many feel like
[1:08:54] doing that tonight i said you're never
[1:08:56] alone come on as our brother caleb said
[1:08:59] that encourages you know we found that
[1:09:01] out
[1:09:02] finding that out still right now but
[1:09:04] early in our christian journey when
[1:09:06] everybody forsook you forsake you
[1:09:08] and forsook you or whatever and walked
[1:09:11] on then you got in that lonely place
[1:09:13] seemed to be lonely but then you found
[1:09:15] out that
[1:09:16] jesus was a friend like no other he took
[1:09:20] up time with you people don't sometimes
[1:09:23] i've seen it people don't take up time
[1:09:25] with you
[1:09:26] people love
[1:09:27] being around you sometimes and you're
[1:09:28] healthy and god you can do for them but
[1:09:30] fall on your sick bed sometimes
[1:09:33] get that place the way you can't do for
[1:09:35] them i seen it
[1:09:36] family all these things get to that
[1:09:37] place now
[1:09:40] come on
[1:09:41] sometimes they won't come see about you
[1:09:43] let alone pray for you
[1:09:45] but nevertheless in that time don't you
[1:09:47] know god's still there
[1:09:50] don't you know don't you know god never
[1:09:51] left he's still right there but he
[1:09:53] wanted to show you something
[1:09:55] that man will fail you
[1:09:57] but god won't
[1:09:59] i'll forget about you
[1:10:01] you know sometimes you think people
[1:10:03] won't i'll forget about you but god will
[1:10:05] never forget about you that's why your
[1:10:07] trust need to be in
[1:10:09] not in a church building
[1:10:11] not in a man or any such thing but your
[1:10:14] trust need to be in god and god alone
[1:10:16] come on because you don't know what
[1:10:18] tomorrow bring
[1:10:19] but when tomorrow comes you know that
[1:10:21] god is still there amen
[1:10:35] praise god amen
[1:10:38] never alone amen
[1:10:40] we thank god for the word tonight and
[1:10:43] thank god for brother ernest and
[1:10:44] recalling different ones
[1:10:47] appreciate you
[1:10:49] never alone
[1:10:51] i wrote down some things today um
[1:10:57] none of them is lost jesus said
[1:11:00] and gave me that consolation
[1:11:02] because sometimes you
[1:11:04] you want to save everybody you want
[1:11:06] everybody to be saved
[1:11:09] and you try to reach out and you know
[1:11:13] i was telling brother nathan and thanks
[1:11:15] down to mullins last night that says
[1:11:18] god love is unconditional
[1:11:21] he loves us in spite
[1:11:24] it's not on
[1:11:25] how good we
[1:11:26] were and how good we are
[1:11:29] his love is unconditional
[1:11:32] he didn't die for us because we were so
[1:11:34] good
[1:11:36] or because of what we done
[1:11:38] but while we were yet sinners god died
[1:11:41] for the ungodly
[1:11:43] and i thank god that jesus came and
[1:11:45] thought enough of us
[1:11:48] when we were
[1:11:50] alienated when we were fall from god the
[1:11:52] enemies in our minds by wicked words
[1:11:55] but yet he thought enough about us
[1:11:57] to die on the cross for us
[1:12:00] he cared enough about us when we didn't
[1:12:02] even care about our own soul
[1:12:04] he still loved us in spite of
[1:12:07] he cared enough about us
[1:12:09] i said how much he forgave us
[1:12:12] how much more should we forgive one
[1:12:14] another
[1:12:16] how much more should we forgive one
[1:12:18] another
[1:12:19] you know sometimes
[1:12:20] we we our
[1:12:22] our forgiveness is limited
[1:12:24] that's why jesus said till 70 times 70
[1:12:28] that's how far we ought to go
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:32] that's in a day
[1:12:34] you say as your heavenly father forgave
[1:12:36] you so you can forgive men their
[1:12:39] trespasses
[1:12:40] so by the grace of god
[1:12:42] when we think about it amen we can bear
[1:12:46] one another burdens
[1:12:48] let's bear
[1:12:50] one another amen
[1:12:52] because we're living in a time where
[1:12:55] the love of many would wax coal
[1:12:59] and because the love of many waxing coal
[1:13:02] we got to have that unconditional love
[1:13:04] but we can't have it in ourselves the
[1:13:07] only way we're going to have the kind of
[1:13:08] love that god has we got to have the
[1:13:10] holy ghost
[1:13:11] other than that our love is going to be
[1:13:13] limited
[1:13:15] it's going to be limited to loving them
[1:13:17] that love us
[1:13:18] or that we think they love us and those
[1:13:21] that are concerned about us and care
[1:13:22] about us
[1:13:24] but those that really
[1:13:26] hate us and despise us
[1:13:28] are you able to love them
[1:13:30] unconditionally also
[1:13:32] those that
[1:13:34] you think hate you don't like you don't
[1:13:37] care nothing about you can you love them
[1:13:39] unconditional
[1:13:41] and that's what it is
[1:13:43] love is that unconditional love that's
[1:13:46] what god wants to see in his people
[1:13:49] that you can have enough love that you
[1:13:51] can cover multitude of sin
[1:13:54] our mistakes and our faults you can love
[1:13:57] us enough to cover up all of that
[1:14:00] and that's what god wants to see in his
[1:14:02] people i'll tell you if we're going to
[1:14:03] get out here in a rapture in faith and
[1:14:05] get out here
[1:14:07] and be caught up to meet him in the air
[1:14:10] our love got to be unconditional and you
[1:14:12] can't have it on your own
[1:14:14] it's got to be god god god pay love god
[1:14:18] coming out in you
[1:14:19] doing it for you because you cannot do
[1:14:22] it on your own
[1:14:24] god bless you let us stand
[1:14:29] praise god
[1:14:57] oh jesus
[1:15:06] there is no pain
[1:15:10] jesus
[1:15:13] can feel
[1:15:17] and there is
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:36] according to
[1:15:39] his power
[1:15:43] for
[1:15:45] the battle
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:50] is is
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:20] that is
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:34] no matter what
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] you're going through
[1:16:40] remember
[1:16:43] [Music]
[1:16:46] no matter
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:52] remember remember remember
[1:16:58] [Music]
