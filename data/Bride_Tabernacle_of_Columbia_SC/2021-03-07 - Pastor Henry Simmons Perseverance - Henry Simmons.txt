redeem the time because the days are evil god just speaks so much to my heart and encouraging me so much just to listen to god's servant amen and i want to say we ought to continually do that it's just a it's just a it'll be an encouragement to you if you do it god bless you 15 and 21 it says then jesus went dense and departed into the course of tyre siding and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a what not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cries after us and he answered and said i'm not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel then came she and worshiped him she must have fell down and said lord what lord help me i wonder how many need his help this morning lord help me i was listening i was reading i said lord help me help me i need your help but he answered and said it is not need for to take the children bread and cast it until unto dogs see in other words he was calling a woman a dog and he said what you want it belongs to the children they don't belong to the dogs and i i can't take the children bread and give it to the dogs are you with me seem pretty hard speech isn't that right but that was jesus okay but it pulled something out of that woman it pulled she had a need and it pulled something out of her and she said truth you telling the truth lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master table see for many people that would have been it for them but she and jesus answered said unto her o woman greatest thou what be and unto thee even as thou had thou wilt and her daughter was what made whole from the very that very hour god is good god bless you this morning i i like to talk to you about perseverance prayers of ignorance you know the word perseverance speaks of being persistent we must be persistent god is good amen be persistent hallelujah you know just out here by myself i was just enjoying jesus early this morning hallelujah i was just praising the lord because i was being persistent i was praising the lord because somebody said when i think of the goodness of jesus and all that he's done for me my soul cries out hallelujah thank god for saving me hallelujah i don't know what you feel like this morning but i hope you feel like being persistent i'm not going to let no devil stop me from praising my god this morning hallelujah i don't care what it's oh lord but i'm not gonna let a devil stop me from praising god i thought about that this morning as i began to praise god and began to walk around the building and say thank you jesus praise the lord lift my hand to the lord and hallelujah praise god i don't know what's wrong with the people today but seem like people won't praise him because they don't want to praise him amen but i want to give god praise hallelujah i don't care what the folk think that is kind of work up makeup i'll tell you amen that's something we ought to be doing we ought to be persistent we ought to let it make the devil know what side we own amen i'm here to praise the lord amen that's what the scripture said isn't that right you got to believe what the scripture says scripture said come into his gates with thanksgiving into his coats with what praise and if you're not doing

america and one of these it'll blow up the whole whole america a a big earthquake boom what happens brother and sister you see at any time we'll we're we're on the verge we're on the edge anything can happen at any time remember god promised that in that time amen there is a place that god will hide you even in a time of trouble i shall hide you he will hide us in his pervasion in the secrets of his time and i could he shall hide us so god got a safe place for you and i the noah's of this age recognizing amen that you must be persistent he says here he says the end has come he says i read the 13th verse again for god said and to know the end of all flesh is what is before me are you with me and he says here that for the earth is full of what a violence is that right is the earth full of violence through them and behold i will what i will destroy them with the earth amen make thee a what make thee an ark of go forward and rooms thou make it in the ark and i shall pitch it within and without god told noah to make an ark and i believe god has made you and i he made us a way for this day the ark that we are to run in the bible said the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous running into it and they are what see god want to save us but he has the ark prepared for us to run into it if we don't run into this the name of jesus and go running into that art of safety
