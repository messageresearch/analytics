the need is Lord you're more than able to meet it tonight and I pray that you would do so Lord I pray God that you will look upon these requests God and bless them Lord I pray for those that are here those that had a desire to come but couldn't make it tonight I pray God that you would be with them also Lord and oh God I just pray Lord and we said or done anything that ain't like you throughout

and let us be reconciled to you oh God that we might hear from Heaven Lord we thank you and Lord we love you and we appreciate you and God we give you all the glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to look at First Corinthians by the grace of God 10 and we'll begin at the 12th verse first first Corinthians 10 and 12. you got to say Amen and it reads wherefore let him that thinketh he stand to take it take heed lest ye fall there I have no temptation taking you but such as is common to man but God is faithful whom will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with all with the Temptation also make a way uh make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it may God have the blessing to read of his word he may be seated I'm going to read a little further down but that that is a consolation to know that you know he says there ain't no temptation taking such as common to man but God is faithful amen and he won't suffer you to go through nothing that you won't be able to bear and he says and even the things that you go through that he allow you to go through it he can also make a way of Escape for you and he says that you may be able to bear so in those times when you're thinking that you can't bear it because you're too weak guard he brought you through it to it like like I said he gonna bring you through it amen and give you that strength to make it through that so you know we always rest in that consolation I was talking I think his brother Jireh the other day was talking about something on the phone I told him I said man I couldn't bear that out he said yeah you could he kept telling me he says that if the Lord allowed it you'll be at a bear I said okay I know I can't bear that I said Lord no I Lord no I can't bear it so he can't allow me to go through it but nevertheless whatever whatever comes in your life you know God God gives us the mentality that you know no matter what comes my way no matter what challenge whatever I got to face I'm going I'm gonna make it through it it might catch me on the worst sometimes but nevertheless I'ma fight my way through it because God has brought me here and this is this is where I'm at and I'm gonna fight my way because God he said he put no more on us than we can Bear right you know I took me back to a time in my mind I was I was saying I said Lord you know what's the worst thing that's going to happen to me in this life and then I began to say you know it don't matter it don't matter what what happens because I was thinking that little song No matter um I mean what comes my way you know no matter you don't have to worry and all those things it says you know because God is going to take care of it so I said no matter what it is you know I know that I can make it I know I can stand no matter what comes my way my life is in his hands I know that so you know that's the consolation that we always uh come back to in our in our minds so you know tonight by the grace of God we want to talk about glory amen and and you know how we we make this um statement all the time it's just a part of our our speaking the the God we want to give you all the glory and a lot of times we're just saying that and it's just became the norm uh to us right so you know and uh I want to read a little further down just go down because I don't want to be too long here let's drop down to the to the 31st verse we're talking about Glory tonight amen to the 31st verse and it reads whether therefore you eat or drink whatsoever you do do all to the glory of God give none offense neither to the Jews nor Gentiles nor the Church of God even as I please all men in all things not uh seeking my own Prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved but I want to dwell on that part you know because he was talking about a lot of things that you can go home and read it sometimes you know but he was talking about you know how to conduct yourself when you go amongst the Gentiles you know whatever a man put before you eat you know and he says if we've been sacrificed to Idols don't eat it he says but you know don't offend many but always try to think on the next man and not not on yourselves you know and then you begin to I like a little one place that kind of stuck to me how he was saying you know you can't eat at God's table and at the devil's table also he said you can't drink from the cup of the Lord and drink from the cup of the devil too you can't do that so you know those those things you know just kind of stick out to you but or he was as he was going on just talking about how to conduct yourself and things but he was saying no matter what you do eat or drink or whatever you do let it be to the glory of God and you know I was I was praying the other day and then and it just dropped in my spirit I said Lord I was saying to myself I said Lord you know no matter what I do or what I become in this life I want you to get the glory out of it and that's what it is I said Lord I want you to get the glory out of whatever whatever I do or become no matter what it is Lord I want you to get the glory out of my life you know sometimes you think uh uh you know you got to be you know I guess out in Forefront the scene and all these things for God to get Glory but God wants glory out of your life he won't and I says God I wanna I wanna give you the glory and it's like I said something dropped in my spirit I can hear the Lord saying to me the glory that that that I what I call Glory ain't what you thinking of Glory is you know sometimes we look at glory it's just as you know the power and all these things but he says I'm is sending me in one in my spirit you know I could show imma show you what glory is so I began to think about it I said you know when you think about Glory we're saying it we're looking at it as the praise or worship offered in Thanksgiving to deity you know praise or worship but I say is that you know God's path to Glory a lot of times you know like he says it ain't it ain't our path and what we're looking at I thought about you know uh just as a people the Roman people at Point what their where they've always sought out there was glory and they most time they sought out there on the battlefield so when they went to battle it was whoever won as many battles the most battles they were the most powerful neither ones had the most what they call it glory and then they would sometimes call themselves to be divine and all because of the battles that they won they saw it sought out the uh Power and that and they thought that you know that's getting that kind of Glory you know you'll be I guess um lifted up in front of men so they enjoyed that they lustered after that kind of glory and I started thought about that I said you know those Spirits are still here today that's why you know even themselves they were cut throats they were they would uh cut each other's throat just to become the emperor just to become consulate and all you know friends would turn against each other and all why because they wanted that Glory they wanted to beat that power and even though you know like I said those Spirits it even dwells in the church today it dwells there you know people say God I want you to get all the glory but yet they want they want themselves to be out in the Forefront and then you know what those same way they carried out the natural they do it in the spirit just cut people down Cut You Down whatever those things why to try to get the glory but I said you know God assured me that ain't the glory you know the the path when God the glory that God uh wants out your life ain't that type of Glory come on I was thinking about so many characters in The Bible and and I says you know God the glory that the path to the glory you know I thought about Joseph yes he could he had a gift that he dreamed dreams and interpret dreams and all those things that in itself seemed to be a special gift but the glory how did God get Gloria out of that you know and a lot of times it was through the things that he suffered you know that gift that he had caused his own Brothers to hate him because of that gift that he had didn't he you know and I thought about that I said what happens a lot of times God began to stir on your heart something and I said you know what happened uh Spirits jealousy all these things that come against us fight against you a lot of times it'll be your own family friends whatever whether they fight against you and all it is because it ain't them it ain't the people but it's Spirits because they know that God is one you you're trying to carry out what the will of God is for your life and the devil's job is to stop you he don't want you to carry out the will of God for your life so he'll use in anybody and anything he can to stop the will of God and it cause you to start fighting against people fighting against that one right there why are you fighting against them because you're thinking it's them but what it is it's the devil the whole time and you can't afford allow yourself to get engaged in in that type of warfare combat like that because then you won't be carrying out what the will of God is for your life but once God put something in your heart and you know what uh God is is requiring a calling throughout your life you got to have your eyes single on that what God has called you for come on and stay with it I believe that you know Laura was showing me showing me something you know the other day and I said it's God that's what it is sometimes we'll fight fight against this and that one but if it's the Lord you know and you ain't gonna better stop it but if it if it ain't him it won't come to nothing but nevertheless what it is I said God I want you to get the glory out of my life Lord I don't want to be in confrontation with all uh spirits and all you know you're going to have to I says but whatever it is God I want my I want to be single I want my eyes to stay focused oh God what you put in my heart to do what you what you called me for that's all I want to do God I just wanna and then that way I know you getting the glory out of it it ain't me but it's God getting the glory out of my life how many want that tonight but I say is that you know Joseph couldn't help that that the gift that he had could he but it brought about a bunch of jealousy and stuff didn't it it would cause his own Brothers selling but you know I said I wasn't saying that the glory I mean it was just in the gift but when when he can go and and be sold to um to Egypt and be lied on Hallelujah and get thrown in jail not only even in the midst of that he didn't lose his testimony did he even in the midst of that he still wanted God to get Glory out his life he could have stopped right there and says well this gift that God gave me is what got me into trouble I'm in now but no even in the jail he was still using the gift that God gave him interpreting dreams and so forth but God had a place to use that gift didn't he but when it came out what it was God God got Glory out of Joseph's life and it wasn't nothing that Joseph uh done to make himself so great and all these things but it was God that took him that gave him that gift and God took him down that path that road which I believe was a character building process go through all these things and why me Lord why I got to go through why I got to suffer these things but nevertheless he still I believe found a way to give God glory and all of that and in the very end he's his brother says that you know there was a a word about him getting revenge but he said no it wasn't you but it was God that sent me it was God the whole time because he he knew what was coming ahead and he wanted people to be saved so he took me down that road I had to suffer the things I had to suffer now I can see the tender hand of God the mercy of God and all these things I understand what it's all about now I know what it's like to be lied on cheated talked about mistreated like they said you know what that's like and I know how to forgive God's glory was in forgiveness God's glory was in that I believe it I said but what it is the glory come on God says his path to glory in our path right Moses was born to Prophet Prophet child and all those things had something that God wanted to do in his life but that wasn't necessarily the way the glory was but God waited till he got to be 80 years old right because he could have did it in his strength in his Youth and all that no he waited till he got to be 80 years old weak right can't hardly talking all these things now God said now I'ma send you and even looking at that didn't even look sensible reasonable and it I can hear in the scriptures you know Moses saying I can't talk right I can't talk I can't we just paraphrase can't hold it walk how you gonna send me look like if you to use me you'd use me when I was strong sometimes in our spirit we get that way God why you didn't use me in the good times when I was up on the mountain God why you didn't use me then come on but when where the glory of God is is when you at your weakest when you down and out when you when you ain't in the good times but when you all alone by yourself when you you realize you can't do the job you ain't even counting yourself worthy to be even to be called to do the job but that's where the glory of God shows up and he says that who made man's mouth damn come on I'm sending you I'm gonna use that you where I want to get Glory out of now so the glory wasn't necessarily in him being a prophet of who he was but God did it didn't he God or got him into that place and the path to Glory was a hard path but nevertheless to God be all the glory you look at Abraham's life oh 100 years old and all these things dried up but see what it is when you look at lives you're necessarily not looking at all the acts and the power they did but you looking at what God did for their lives and you're looking at how God took nothing and he turned it into something you look at how God took the the rejected the cast out the ones that was uh uh rejected by the world and he took them and he used them because they saw themselves not worthy Hallelujah oh Jesus but God got Glory out of it and it's easy to give God glory when you realize that it was no way possible it was nothing that you could do to help Salvage the situation when you know that it is nothing the doctors couldn't help you nobody couldn't help you friends because when you realize that the situation was over and all of a sudden something changed just overnight the quickening Spirit came the power came is different it's easy to give God glory then because you can look at it and say God I know it wasn't me I know it wasn't me ain't had nothing God that was you Lord when somebody asks you how you can't even mention yourself all you can do is talk about God it was God that did it it was God that brought me out it was God that took care it was God that watched over it was God that blessed me I had done given up but God showed up Hallelujah and I want to give him glory Hallelujah come on but I say it's the glory you know God the way we look at glory sometimes a lot of times ain't ain't you know what God God I like how he told Gideon he says that I don't want you to go down to all the men for them to think that they won the battle on themselves because God wanted to get Glory out the situation didn't he so he said I'm gonna take with these 300 but these these 300 right here I'm gonna take them and I'm gonna go down there and I'm Gonna Give You Deliverance so when it's talked about years from now Hallelujah centuries from now they'll know that it was God that did it it wasn't man was no other no no no no great General devising the plan but it was God that did it God got Glory you know God wants some people that's going to give him glory God wants a man that he can use that he he won't have himself in the way a word about that's why Paul said thinking on himself don't think on Paul gave his life that others might you know he gave his life and his whole living all that sacrifice everything that he might see uh Souls come to the kingdom of God souls to be genuinely saved he might like it says been the priest and all that but he gave all that up because he saw it as as he says in one place he says I glory in my infirmities that the the power of Christ might dwell in me come on all my infirmities that's where God is getting the glory out of my life oh Hallelujah when I met my weakest that's when God is getting the glory so when I'm uh can't Holly got these things and I'm praying that God will take it away from him but no I realize God is getting Glory out of it because he helping me that I won't see myself higher than what I ought to be or think of myself higher than what I ought to be but he's keeping me at a level of humility the one the level of humility that I need to walk on for his power to be in my life Hallelujah I said God that's what I want oh sometimes we can we can bring about those things on ourselves but God said that ain't the glory I'm talking about out there thought about Luther and how you joined the the most strictest uh sex of monks and all whipping himself and doing all these things right to try to uh uh emulate or whatever the sufferings of Christ but he realized that ain't what God wanted God wanted a surrender heart God wanted to surrender life a child that no matter what he asked him to do they'll be willing to do it no matter what he asks them to give up they'll be willing to give up Hallelujah and they won't look to God as if he owe them nothing because they know that they owe him everything you know that's what we always says God don't owe us nothing but we owe him everything we owe him our life we owe him our souls Body Spirit we owe him all because he's the only reason we got the Breath of Life he's the only reason we ain't Dead and Gone he's the only reason we're in good health he's the only reason we were able to walk in the Church of God tonight so we owe him everything come on Hallelujah but it says you know I was thinking about going over that you know it was in my spirit says that you know he says I'm gonna show you the path to glory and I see how Christ the Bible says he left of himself of what no reputation right whoa he says you know he could have came down in a certain way but no he wanted to show you where his glory way God was getting Glory at where a man that didn't look like he was nothing right walking like it says with dirty feet maybe didn't look like he was nothing I thought about it when I was in prayer I said you know Jesus standing there before Pilate knows with blood dripping down his face with a crown of thorns on his head with a robe wrapped around him with dirty feet maybe bruises and all didn't look like much did it but they didn't know who was standing in front of him I said if they would only knew who that was behind all of that if they would only knew who they had standing right there in front of them but in all of that God was getting Glory out of it he said he glorified his name he said I'll glorified again God was getting Glory out of that he showed how low he could get Hallelujah oh Jesus I said they only had a no it didn't look like much that was standing right there in front of him didn't look like much God could have came down like it said all the style and all these things made a big scenery no but he he was showing you where his glory was at in the things that that that's uh uh uh well overlooked most of the time but he was showing you where his glory was at Hallelujah you know I was thinking about today I said you know God wants to get the glory out of life right I thought about Samson and how you know he was a Nazarite from birth and you know God raised him up for the purpose you know you could have said what God was using I mean the anointing would come on him and God was getting Glory yes God was using them but where the real glory came was when he had fallen come on God didn't put him in that place he ended up at his sins put him there his lust put him there but you know God even in that was going to get Glory out of it with his hair his locks chopped off I like how the Bible says but they started growing again Hallelujah God was getting ready to get Glory he was getting ready to show you he was getting ready to show that he even uh Samson know he was in a back sliding state that if that heart could genuinely come to repentance come on call out to God he said Lord just remember me but what it is even in that he says Lord let me die with my enemies come on and in that time he killed more it was talked about you know you we know he talked about him killing the lion and him pulling the gates up him doing all these uh mighty things that he's done but when you think about Samson you think about how his hair got chopped off for the most part his eyes got plucked out he's standing be in uh holding on to the pillars a backslidden state but a man even in that backsliding state with a genuine repentance calling out to God God heard him and remembered them didn't he and God glory out his life come on Hallelujah oh God I said Lord what it is you know the path to Glory he says I want to show you that that path to Glory It Ain't Easy come on it's a hard path and it's a pal that's that that that's painful painstaking a lot of times I says you know even in the younger younger Ministry you know sometimes you look at the older Saints or whatever all the Ministries and you might say Marvel at the certain things or but you don't understand that a lot of things came through suffering too a lot of things came through trials and tribulations ups and downs you didn't just get the they didn't just get the anointing and be able to walk with such wisdom and all that overnight but what happened you know God brought them through some things and when they came out because maybe you know sometimes you can feel like oh I'm I can play I could preach I could do whatever you know and maybe and maybe you can because of the gift that God gave you but he won't get his glory out of it how the glory comes a lot of times you got you give your life really over to the Lord and it ain't you speaking but it's God speaking come on but he takes you through some things he humbles you down a little bit brings you to that point Hallelujah The Way You Feel So Unworthy you feel like it God I can't do the job I don't know how to handle this situation what it is God brought you there sometimes you can say that from your mouth but it's it's a difference when God brought you there difference when God took you through something Hallelujah then he shows up y'all believe that tonight I believe it come on but I said you know what it is the glory you know we think about that Paul he's saying no matter what no matter what you do right do it all for the glory of God it says most of the time the glory of God is is mostly often you know associated with suffering and all those things I says but what it is you know God wants to get Glory out of your life a lot of times like we always talk about people say I want to be like Paul but you just want the glory and the power looking at it from that standpoint but look at all look at the suffering that he had to go through look at look at the life that had to be lived Hallelujah but you don't put yourself through those things you don't devise up sufferings for yourself come on but your job is just yield yourself as a vessel to God Lord I just want to do your will whatever comes my way just give me uh like he says uh uh uh make me able to Bear it God make a way for escape for me no matter what comes my way no matter what lot you got for my life come to that no matter what part you got for my life no matter what you're calling me to God no matter what it is Lord let me do it with all of my heart let me get out of the way Lord and let you have your way in my life come on no matter what tomorrow might bring because in the end all I want I want to make it to Heaven I want to make I want I don't want my soul to be lost I want to hear you say Well done not good and faithful my good and faithful servant of God I want to hear those words help me to get out of the way you know a lot of times that's the struggle that's the battle we get out of the way we in the way our feelings in a way we get hurt feelings hurt everything why because you were in the way but when you get out of the way and let God get Glory out of your life in the shameness in the in the rejection come on that's where God gonna get Glory out of it come on and all of that God will get Glory out of how many believe that tonight I said come on the glory of God how many want to give God glory tonight we say it often all the times Lord I want to we're going to give you all the glory and all these things it just becomes a phrase or saying sometimes it's just self-conscious or whatever say those things but nevertheless in our hearts in your heart you really want to give God glory well no matter what comes your way you got to be willing to let God use you and get out of the way like I said what happens a lot of times when you come to that place you know and you doing what God asks you to do or or what God is leading you you know the devil he he don't want to see you in that place because he know that's where God gonna bless you at he know that's where your blessings are he knows I swear where others are going to be blessed at so he don't want to see you in that position he don't want to see you in that place come on so you use any and everything you will to keep you tied up conversation and all that way you can't be effective in the house of God or in the kingdom of God but to understand that we're we're not men Pleasers but we're here to please God and no matter what God I want to do your will I just want to please you Lord no matter what my what you calling me for whatever God I want to please you I might not never be to sometimes well-known person and all these things the biggest uh preacher and all but I just want to please God I just want to see souls coming to the kingdom if all he got was just a testimony that God gave you I want to tell that testimony of God what he gave me all I want to do is tell somebody about what God did for me because I'm still excited I'm glad that God saved me I'm glad that he picked me up turned my life around changed me from who I was I'm glad Hallelujah are you glad tonight amen praise God Amen I was just thinking the days I was reading and prophet of God says to the young ministers and the young this is not only the young ministers young people he said one thing you must understand you must understand and he was talking to the young ministers and he was saying not only the young people but the oldest likewise he said one thing you must do you must do he said you must be able to Master human ability he said you must be able to master human ability and that's what I was listening to brother Ernie's and he said you must be able to master human ability and he said that when you say you can do the job do your own when you think you're strong enough or you intelligent enough and you think you can do it you can't trust your own ability because you can't do the job Moses tried to do it then he had to flee you must learn to master human ability and I was just hearing that through the message tonight you must Master human ability when you say I can do it you'll never please God you'll never be able you'll always be a failure but you realize he said God want to use those to know you want to use those that know they can't do the job once you know amen without God it's impossible to do the job but when you know through your own human ability then you can do it you see you've been you're getting ready to make a mess you're getting ready to fail because you're going to trust in your own human ability your own knowledge your own wisdom your own's strength you're gonna trust in that and when we trust in our ability and our own strength and our own intelligence it's not how intelligently we are how smart we are but God the praise God want to get the glory his brother Ernest said gotta let you get to the point that you were told of failure like Saul when he went down to the masses you had all it took human intelligence and all of that but God let a light shine from heaven and he fell to the Earth and he was blind and he said Lord what would you have me to do are you up here that's what God want to do in our lives if we're not careful we'll be trying to do for ourselves and not let God do it we'll do it with our own human effort our own intelligence but we won't let God Spirit have control if you let God's spirit have control you'll find you the father up the road but when we think that we can do the job oh yes I know what I'm doing I can do it yes go right ahead but God would never accept human ability it's got to be totally God said we got to be willing to surrender all we got to see ourselves in nothing but God you everything God I'm nothing but you all in all but we see ourselves to be strong I can do that I can do it no you can't I know what I'm doing I know how to do it no you don't I know what I'm doing I know what I want what does God want does he want think about it brother sister brother Ernest had to come with that message and then have me reading the same thing today listen to what the prophet said I trust that God spoke to you and the day maybe he spoke wanted me to hear that they're confirmed we got the one thing we must do is to master human ability when you get ready to do something Lord I can but you can everything whatsoever you do in word or indeed do it all into what the name of Jesus realizing if I'm doing it Lord let me do it in your name where you can get the glory but if we're looking for the glory that's the carnal mind and God is good amen I love him let us stand thank God forever wolf tonight praise God God is good Hallelujah appreciate your word tonight God is good [Applause] give God the glory amen Hallelujah y'all seem tired in here praise God we didn't have but a few people last night in Mullins but God really come down and I believe God was speaking tonight I really believe God's speaking let's Master human ability okay anytime we get ourselves that we can do it stop and start praying God let me get out the way let me get out your way and let you do it he said young ministers young people we know what we how to do what we want done no we can let God do it father in Jesus name we thank it day Lord thank you for Lord I know you're speaking I know you're saying something to somebody that's trying to do it [Music] maybe trying to do you a service without it being your will Hallelujah somebody in all their human abilities think that I can get the job done yes I can get it done Hallelujah but you can so many times we'll fail God because we were trying to do it on our own but let's believe God today how many want to move out the way and let God have his way in your life God let me move out the way I've been trusted in my own ability and I want to trust in your ability God I want you to get the glory out of my life whatever I do wherever I go God may you go God get Glory Lord moved his flesh back out of the way God love you to heal and you to deliver you are God have your way to me Lord you save heal and deliver set free by the power of the Holy Ghost let the name of Jesus Christ be glorified have your week now Lord in all lives in Jesus name how many wanted God to have his way how many want to surrender everything Lord we're not sufficient of ourselves and to think anything of ourselves
