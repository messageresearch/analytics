[37:39] and so
[37:41] appreciative for young
[37:43] menen right who could Market their gift
[37:47] like many are doing today um but yet
[37:50] they're serving here in the house of the
[37:51] Lord amen and we ought we ought to
[37:54] appreciate that Matthew 8
[37:59] and we're going to go down and begin
[38:01] reading at verse
[38:11] five Matthew
[38:13] 8 we're going to read verses
[38:16] 5-10 and then we'll follow up with
[38:18] another scripture but let's just read
[38:20] this while we standing the Bible
[38:25] says and when Jesus had entered into
[38:29] capernium
[38:30] there came unto him a
[38:33] centurion beseeching him and saying
[38:38] Lord my servant lith at home sick of the
[38:43] paly grievously
[38:46] tormented and Jesus saith unto
[38:49] him I
[38:52] will come and heal him he didn't say he
[38:55] might he didn't say think about it he
[38:58] said I will come and heal
[39:03] him the Centurion answered and said
[39:06] Lord I am not worthy that thou should us
[39:09] come under my roof but speak the word
[39:15] only and my servant shall be
[39:20] healed for I am a man under
[39:23] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[39:26] say to this this man go and he
[39:29] goeth and to another come and he cometh
[39:33] and to my servant do this and he doeth
[39:37] it and when Jesus heard it he marveled
[39:42] and said to them that followed verily I
[39:46] say unto you I have not
[39:49] found so great faith no not in Israel
[39:56] Lord we pray that you would add a
[39:57] blessing now into the reading of your
[39:59] word and the blessing that we desire
[40:02] Lord is that you will give us
[40:06] understanding for you said in all of our
[40:09] getting that we should get an
[40:11] understanding so have your way today we
[40:13] pray in Jesus name amen you can be
[40:18] seated my it's it's truly a blessing
[40:22] um there is something about Fellowship
[40:26] amen
[40:29] you know when I first came amongst the
[40:31] Believers um came in from the world
[40:35] though I had been raised up uh in the
[40:38] church but all we like sheep the Bible
[40:41] says have gone
[40:42] astray uh but I'm so grateful that he
[40:45] didn't leave me out there amen um he
[40:49] sent something after
[40:52] Meen and no matter sometimes how far you
[40:56] run how hard or how fast you run
[41:00] um he has a way of getting your
[41:03] attention amen amen you know I I know
[41:06] we've all seen a dog in the yard and you
[41:08] know on a chain and uh sometimes
[41:11] somebody walk past the fence and he'll
[41:13] run and run and sometime he
[41:16] forget that chain is around his neck am
[41:19] and when he runs and runs the next thing
[41:21] you know you get
[41:23] snatched right back in the place and I'm
[41:26] so grateful that uh he never
[41:28] disconnected from
[41:30] me um though I was in the world of sin
[41:33] um yet he kept his hands upon me and so
[41:37] there was something that he sent though
[41:39] after
[41:41] me and many times I believe it was the
[41:43] prayers of my
[41:45] grandmother the prayers of my mother and
[41:48] there's something about the word being
[41:54] sent something about the word being
[41:59] spoken um it has there is power in words
[42:03] what those of us who are parents um
[42:06] those of us who may be Educators or
[42:09] whatever it may be uh one thing that we
[42:13] recognize that the manipulation of words
[42:16] can have a lot of effect on
[42:19] people if you ever been a
[42:21] coach
[42:23] um seems like young men young boys
[42:25] sometime they listen to the
[42:27] more than they will they daddy
[42:29] sometime it's just something about that
[42:32] motivation and and the word has power
[42:36] yes sir Jesus made a statement he said
[42:39] my words they are spirit and they are
[42:44] life
[42:46] amen so this morning we speak life amen
[42:50] amen amen because we're speaking the
[42:52] word amen and you know I when I came and
[42:55] I heard uh the the music playing it just
[42:58] got me in the atmosphere I said let me
[43:00] just come out here um I've already
[43:03] talked to the Lord I've already read
[43:05] some scriptures I already prepared uh
[43:08] myself to speak though I didn't know
[43:10] particularly I was going to be speaking
[43:11] this morning but I I like being in the
[43:14] presence amen of the Saints I like being
[43:18] where the spirit of the Lord is for he
[43:20] promised us amen with a with a word he
[43:24] promised us that where two or three are
[43:26] gathered together in his name that he be
[43:28] in the midst amen so this morning and
[43:31] every time that I have an opportunity to
[43:33] go into the house of the Lord I go with
[43:36] an expectation amen for Lord whatever my
[43:39] situation is whatever my condition is
[43:42] you will send a
[43:45] word turn to Psalms
[43:50] 107 and no matter how many times I tell
[43:53] myself this and I try to rehearse this
[43:56] thought that I'm not get excited it is
[43:58] something about the word that stimulates
[44:02] amen for a Believer the word should
[44:05] really speak to you it should really
[44:08] move you
[44:10] amen not a word that we might get on the
[44:13] phone when somebody called not a word
[44:16] that we might get when we uh reading the
[44:19] text or searching the gram and all this
[44:23] stuff it not just that type of word I'm
[44:26] talking about a word word that has the
[44:28] power to change us amen amen
[44:33] amen I I don't like to come to church
[44:35] and uh I don't want to come in empty and
[44:38] then leave out
[44:39] empty I promise you if you pay your
[44:42] money to go to a restaurant your
[44:44] intention when you go in I might come in
[44:46] hungry but I don't expect to leave out
[44:48] hungry amen amen if that was the case we
[44:52] could ate at
[44:53] home save a few dollars
[44:57] many times I I much rather stay at home
[45:01] thank the Lord for having my wife with
[45:03] me for my wife is a good cooker I rather
[45:06] eat at
[45:07] home I already bought groceries one time
[45:09] I don't need to go out buy no more
[45:12] somebody can't even
[45:14] cook but you know when I come I I don't
[45:17] come if I come empty my prayer my
[45:21] heart's desire is fill me up Lord amen
[45:24] amen amen and I I I tell you brothers
[45:27] and sisters with all the things that
[45:29] life is throwing at us all e
[45:33] even the anticipation the nervous
[45:36] anticipation that people have even now
[45:39] as a result of Elections and things
[45:42] don't know what's coming down the road
[45:44] amen right and there's all kind of
[45:46] projections whether you watch the news
[45:48] or listen to it or read it all kind of
[45:50] projections oh the administration is
[45:53] going through this and oh the administr
[45:55] many people are apprehend
[45:58] many people are even boring on fearful
[46:00] don't know what's going to happen amen I
[46:04] work for the federal government for 31
[46:06] years and things are getting ready to
[46:08] change drastically if the Lord
[46:12] carries but I am I am not
[46:16] fearful I'm not going to worry myself I
[46:20] got nephews and my daughter works for
[46:22] the government I'm not fearful oh lord
[46:25] they're going to lose their benefits God
[46:27] Will Make A
[46:30] Way and he said I I've
[46:34] never never seen the
[46:37] righteous
[46:39] forsaken noise he begging bread oh you
[46:42] may have may have been bordering on
[46:44] hungry before but real hunger brings
[46:49] pain so we might have wanted something
[46:51] to eat but I mean that real hunger Lord
[46:54] help us to hunger and thirst yes for
[46:57] more of
[46:58] him amen I promise you he will fill you
[47:02] amen Psalm 107 I might skip around a
[47:04] little bit because there's a very common
[47:06] theme when you read Psalm
[47:08] 107 um that as you read it it it might
[47:12] come become repetitive to you to an
[47:15] extent but the purpose of that is to
[47:17] drive the point home I don't care how
[47:20] good you are with a hammer usually you
[47:22] had to hit a nail more than once to get
[47:24] it to really see
[47:27] so sometime God repeats
[47:30] himself right that's a point of emphasis
[47:32] there is there is something that he's
[47:34] trying to say and he wants to get our
[47:36] attention so he'll repeat it amen how
[47:39] many times you tell your child to stop
[47:41] okay my point should be
[47:44] taken too many times you say stop once
[47:47] and that was it you had to reinforce
[47:50] that right so I'm going to go to verse
[47:52] one and here is where the heart of any
[47:56] uh
[47:57] believer should be it says oh give
[48:00] thanks unto the
[48:02] Lord for he is good
[48:06] amen we hear that cliche repeated it all
[48:09] the time God is good all the and all the
[48:12] time we hear that repeated but in our
[48:16] behavior in our conduct sometime it
[48:18] seems like we forget
[48:21] that we serve a good god am oh well why
[48:24] does he allow this why does he allow
[48:26] that many the things that happen to us
[48:28] we bring upon ourselves amen many times
[48:33] amen if we stay into the Ark of
[48:36] protection things will come but you'll
[48:38] have some Solace some peace of mind to
[48:41] know that many are the Affliction of the
[48:43] righteous amen but the Lord will deliver
[48:46] him out of them all am the word was sent
[48:49] to comfort us
[48:52] amen when Jesus died he said if I go not
[48:55] away then the comforter won't come amen
[48:58] so he went away and he sent his
[49:02] word that's what I want to talk about
[49:04] this morning he sent his word to heal us
[49:08] amen
[49:09] amen to heal you when you don't even
[49:12] think you need healing to heal you when
[49:14] you didn't even know you was wounded
[49:17] sometime we suppress those feelings amen
[49:20] amen sometime we hide our experiences
[49:24] and don't want anybody to know about it
[49:26] out of sh shame or whatever the case may
[49:28] be but he sent a word for you this
[49:31] morning to heal you
[49:34] amen Psalm 107 says let the redeemed of
[49:38] the Lord say so amen you know people say
[49:42] oh I'm just a sinner saved by grace no I
[49:45] was a sinner but I have been saved by
[49:48] grace I'm not going to keep labeling
[49:51] myself as a sinner amen
[49:54] amen this is a body of s but the real me
[49:58] ain't never
[50:01] sin bless him Lord let the redeemed of
[50:05] the Lord say so how many redeemed do we
[50:07] have in the building amen
[50:10] amen
[50:12] amen then if you redeem then say
[50:16] so stop acting like you're in the pawn

[50:25] cares amen you're not in the pawn shop
[50:29] no more you've been redeemed amen we've
[50:33] been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
[50:35] amen let me read this it said whom he
[50:38] hath redeemed from the hand of the
[50:45] enemy I'm grateful this
[50:49] morning because I know where I could
[50:51] have
[50:53] been I know that the phase of of life
[50:57] that I'm in right now the chapter of my
[50:59] life that I'm in right now could have
[51:01] been a whole lot
[51:02] different or had I not been
[51:07] redeemed how many know that the wages of
[51:11] sin is
[51:15] deatha man and I was like the song said
[51:17] I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the
[51:21] peaceful
[51:22] Shore right but it was his love that
[51:24] Lifted Me
[51:26] well how did I even find out anything
[51:28] about his love because somebody sent a
[51:31] word say young man Jesus loves
[51:34] you all your sin all your mess all the
[51:37] stuff that you did there was someone who
[51:40] still loved you go to verse 15 I'm going
[51:44] to I'm going to move
[51:45] on um there is a
[51:48] preaching anointing here this
[51:52] morning that means somebody came that
[51:55] wanted to hear the word that's all it

[52:00] run up and down and if the Lord says so
[52:03] then hey we going to have a good time
[52:05] but nevertheless it's the word that will
[52:07] Quicken us amen
[52:11] amen the Centurion that we just read
[52:13] about he didn't even consider himself
[52:16] worthy that's right am to receive
[52:18] visitation from the Lord even though
[52:20] Jesus himself said I will come amen he
[52:23] didn't hesitate so where you live I
[52:26] ain't going over that part of
[52:29] town he didn't no he didn't hesitate he
[52:32] said I will come and heal him amen he
[52:37] will come this morning and heal you if
[52:39] you desire he be healed am amen you say
[52:43] I ain't sick well if you in sin you sick

[52:47] amen greatest sickness plaguing the
[52:50] Earth today is sin sickness
[52:52] amen but there is bomb in Gilead yesen
[52:56] for the
[52:57] healing of the people my verse 15 says
[53:01] again oh that men would praise the
[53:06] Lord for his goodness now there's
[53:09] several verses within this division of
[53:12] Psalm where that statement is repeated
[53:15] oh that men would praise the Lord for
[53:17] his goodness and for his wonderful Works
[53:21] to the children of
[53:23] men for he hath broken the gate of
[53:28] brass and cut the bars of iron and
[53:32] thunder fools because of their
[53:34] transgression and because of their
[53:36] iniquities are
[53:38] afflicted their soul abhor all manner of
[53:42] meat and they draw near unto the gates
[53:45] of
[53:46] death
[53:48] then they cry unto the Lord in their
[53:51] trouble and he saveth them out of their
[53:55] distresses
[53:58] it's it it's a shame to need help and
[54:02] don't ask for help amen
[54:04] amen there are people in this country
[54:08] Right This Land of Plenty this this land
[54:11] that had open arms to receive immigrants
[54:14] and things like that once upon a time um
[54:17] but people get upset when you see folks
[54:19] going to get
[54:21] help help is
[54:24] available all they doing is going to
[54:26] stand in the line produce whatever
[54:29] documentation the people ask for and
[54:32] they get help and folks get upset oh
[54:35] they get help we don't get help many
[54:37] times we don't get help cuz we don't ask
[54:39] for it
[54:41] BL Clos mouth don't get fed
[54:47] amen if you're hungry it's okay to ask
[54:50] amen amen if you're hungry God will feed
[54:54] us amen
[54:57] and he
[54:59] said then they CED unto the Lord in
[55:02] their trouble and he saveth them
[55:10] amen I think about often when I read
[55:13] this
[55:14] passage of the telling of Peter when he
[55:18] got out of the
[55:19] boat and walked on the water he said
[55:22] Lord is it you then if it's you bid me
[55:25] to come
[55:28] amen and and everybody think about the
[55:31] negative side oh he took his eyes off
[55:33] the Lord he went down when most people
[55:35] wouldn't even had nerve enough to step
[55:36] out the
[55:38] [Music]
[55:39] boat but they talk about oh he's su he
[55:42] took his eyes off the Lord that's when
[55:44] we go
[55:46] down that's when we begin to sing but
[55:49] you know the positive outlook that that
[55:52] I can present to you this morning about
[55:54] Peter when he be the sink he threw up
[55:57] his hand and said Save Me
[56:00] Lord we'll see ourselves going down and
[56:03] we refuse to ask for help no we getting
[56:08] weak no we getting weak but won't go to
[56:11] the your brother or your sister and say
[56:13] sis pray with me brother pray with me
[56:16] you I'm not saying oh you got to tell
[56:18] your business to everybody that's not
[56:19] what I'm
[56:21] saying a lot of time testimony service
[56:23] is people oh I thank the Lord my bill
[56:26] was do and I ain't know where the money
[56:27] was coming from bless God he paid it
[56:30] okay that's fine but how about the
[56:32] testimony to say brothers and sisters I
[56:34] want you to pray for me the enemy's been
[56:36] on my back and I need some help
[56:39] amen I ain't winning not one bit of
[56:41] detail amen if you want to go spread
[56:44] that around the town that's fine they
[56:45] said what brother said enemy was bwing
[56:48] good maybe somebody else might pray
[56:50] amen but if there is help available why
[56:54] wouldn't we ask for it amen the
[56:58] Centurion he knew he needed help and
[57:01] here's the thing that moved me about
[57:02] that it didn't say that he was asking
[57:05] the Lord to come and heal his
[57:08] son or his
[57:10] daughter he said my
[57:13] servant life at home sick of the
[57:17] pausy but if you would pray for him I
[57:21] ain't even worthy that you come under my
[57:23] roof but just speak the word
[57:28] here's here's where my thought came from
[57:30] here it say then they cry unto the Lord
[57:32] verse
[57:33] 19 in their trouble and he saveth them
[57:37] out of their distresses amen verse 20
[57:41] says he sent his word amen and healed
[57:48] them that's right and delivered them
[57:51] from their
[57:54] destructions you know I can think of
[57:57] times when um I maybe was somewhere I
[58:00] didn't have any business being or doing
[58:03] something I didn't have any business
[58:05] doing um but there was a voice that I
[58:08] could
[58:10] hear the voice of my mother speaking the
[58:15] word said boy you need to get yourself
[58:18] together yes you need to be careful
[58:20] where you laying your head down at you
[58:22] need to watch them people you running
[58:24] with and I will hear it
[58:27] what was it it was the Lord using her
[58:32] words to stay in contact sometime we
[58:36] think we get out there so far that we're
[58:38] all alone but he'll send a word to come
[58:40] and get you amen think about the
[58:44] prodical son wasted everything that his
[58:46] father had earned and left for
[58:49] him but here's the reality that many
[58:52] time when you've been raised right
[58:56] amen you know something about the word
[58:58] of the Lord when you look at your own
[59:00] surroundings
[59:01] amen am you'll come to
[59:05] yourself so even the servants in My
[59:07] Father's House living better than
[59:09] this and here I am look at where he was
[59:13] man in a dreadful
[59:16] condition but the words came to him I'll
[59:21] go
[59:22] back how many need oh God how many need
[59:25] to go back
[59:27] from
[59:30] where Lord help me to
[59:34] remember roll back the
[59:36] curtain of memory now and
[59:39] then remind me where I used to be and
[59:43] where I could have been this this very
[59:46] morning amen went on a Sunday morning my
[59:49] mom told me you coming to church and I
[59:51] was grown by this time I said I I I'll
[59:55] be there mama
[59:57] and she sit up the front and she' break
[59:59] her neck till she saw me come in that
[1:00:02] door and I'd come down one aisle when
[1:00:06] they took up the offering put my
[1:00:07] offering in and I went out and went
[1:00:09] right on out to do whatever it was that
[1:00:12] I was going to do but I didn't lie to
[1:00:13] her I told her I was coming I
[1:00:19] came but I missed the most important
[1:00:22] part of the whole
[1:00:23] service it want the singing I en enjoyed
[1:00:26] the singing I love music my entire
[1:00:28] life it wasn't the singing wasn't what
[1:00:31] was important I left before the word
[1:00:34] came
[1:00:35] for and many of those Services he had a
[1:00:38] word that would have touched me that
[1:00:40] would have healed me amen amen but
[1:00:43] sometime the medicine is in the cabinet
[1:00:45] and folks won't take
[1:00:47] it listen I don't know why if you have
[1:00:51] high blood pressure and you wait till
[1:00:54] you start feeling bad to take your
[1:00:56] medicine is too late amen
[1:00:59] amen we are people that do that I don't
[1:01:02] take it till my head start
[1:01:05] hurting if you take it beforehand the
[1:01:07] head the headache might not
[1:01:10] come if we take heed to the
[1:01:13] word amen before we allow the enemy to
[1:01:16] get us out there so far
[1:01:19] amen it won't be so hard coming back
[1:01:23] amen amen
[1:01:26] when You' been raised up in the fear
[1:01:28] right amen and here's how the enemy try
[1:01:32] to trick people up well why should I
[1:01:33] Fear God it's not talking about the type
[1:01:36] of fear that you have for a wild dog no
[1:01:39] it's respect amen it's reverence amen
[1:01:44] children love their father sometime the
[1:01:46] father might have been the
[1:01:46] disciplinarian but they still loved them
[1:01:50] but when your mama say don't make me
[1:01:51] tell your daddy when you get home that
[1:01:54] was a Godly fear that was a good fear
[1:01:56] here make them have some
[1:02:00] respect my daughter's a teacher she said
[1:02:02] she told a little girl I'm going to tell
[1:02:04] your mama tell
[1:02:08] her no no respect no
[1:02:11] reverence there's no
[1:02:14] repercussion especially not when Mama
[1:02:16] drop you off smelling like weed the
[1:02:18] smoke po child smell like weed when it
[1:02:20] come in the
[1:02:22] classroom and we wonder
[1:02:27] God is sending a word am to heal us
[1:02:31] though sometimes we think the word is
[1:02:34] coming to destroy us sometime we think
[1:02:38] your parents are your enemies or
[1:02:40] somebody just want to stop you from
[1:02:42] having
[1:02:45] fun sometime you don't know what
[1:02:48] Avenue uh that that that open door will
[1:02:52] take you when you get free I know

[1:02:56] access to go and come and do what I
[1:02:59] wanted to do right all the protections
[1:03:02] and the safeguards that my mama had put

[1:03:58] kind of late Mom I'm making an
[1:04:01] excuse to go and do what I wanted to do
[1:04:04] because I had this new
[1:04:06] freedom and it was all wrapped up behind
[1:04:08] the game football oh yeah well he ain't
[1:04:11] doing nothing wrong he just playing
[1:04:13] football the game don't last all
[1:04:19] night sometime you blowing the team out

[1:04:22] out of there early mama ain't looking
[1:04:25] for me too
[1:04:27] 11:00 man you know how much mess you can
[1:04:30] get in between 9 and
[1:04:33] 11:30
[1:04:35] 12:00 ain't too much good going on out
[1:04:39] there after 12:00 oh we having fun some
[1:04:42] folks just getting started at 12:00 I'm
[1:04:44] talking about high school
[1:04:47] 16 and you might have had a midnight
[1:04:50] curfew might have my mom said be in this
[1:04:53] house before midnight
[1:04:56] I was 167 had a little dirt
[1:04:59] mustache and I had to be in the house
[1:05:01] before
[1:05:03] 12:00 I used to get laughed at and oh
[1:05:06] but that football Set Me Free you
[1:05:10] play and ain't nothing wrong with the
[1:05:12] game of football it's a child's game but
[1:05:16] today you got multi-millionaires behind
[1:05:18] children's
[1:05:20] games they won't pay a school teacher
[1:05:23] amen won't pay a policeman
[1:05:26] M but one guy on the team have a $100
[1:05:29] million contract other players right on
[1:05:31] the team with him can't get nowhere near
[1:05:33] that kind of money amen behind a game
[1:05:39] amen but people who love you and care
[1:05:41] about you willing to tell you the truth
[1:05:44] we let their word go in this ear and out
[1:05:47] of Amen when they sending the word to
[1:05:50] try to heal you amen sending the word to
[1:05:53] try to help us amen and so when we come
[1:05:57] into this this
[1:05:59] Sanctuary
[1:06:01] um just like many people when you got a
[1:06:03] condition you'll go to your doctor
[1:06:05] you'll keep your appointment um but it's
[1:06:09] fruitless to go to the doctor and not
[1:06:11] take heed to what they're telling
[1:06:14] you you know the Bible even reminds us
[1:06:16] it said that we should give the more
[1:06:19] Earnest
[1:06:21] heed that means we should pay more
[1:06:23] attention to the things that we have
[1:06:26] heard lest at any time we let those
[1:06:30] things
[1:06:33] slip he said well he preached the same
[1:06:35] thing a month ago two months ago yep and
[1:06:38] it needs to be
[1:06:40] repeated how many time your mama tell
[1:06:42] you don't go out there without a coat
[1:06:44] put that coat
[1:06:46] on she didn't just tell me that one time
[1:06:49] she tell me that all winter I'm in a
[1:06:51] hurry I'm rushing I'm Hot Blooded anyway
[1:06:55] I don't need no coat Mama I'm all right
[1:06:58] trying to be cute yeah you do need a
[1:07:01] coat all of these things were said and
[1:07:04] I'm and I'm saying it in a humorous way
[1:07:07] but all these things were said for our
[1:07:11] benefit this word is for our
[1:07:15] benefit God doesn't speak just to hear
[1:07:18] himself
[1:07:23] speak when that man asked for prayer he
[1:07:26] was serious
[1:07:29] amen so much so that he was concerned
[1:07:32] about even his servant am you know what
[1:07:37] extent a mother would go to for a
[1:07:39] child especially for that son them
[1:07:42] mothers and them Sons I'm going tell
[1:07:44] you they will go
[1:07:47] down behind them
[1:07:51] boys and the daddy will go to jail
[1:07:53] behind his daughter
[1:07:56] being Sav I don't want nobody to try me
[1:08:01] either somebody mess around with one of
[1:08:04] them girls I'll probably be in jail call
[1:08:07] the deacons to come get me
[1:08:10] out but it's but it's love that does
[1:08:14] that it's it's love that will constrain
[1:08:18] us to go the extra mile to look look we
[1:08:22] look beyond all their faults well not my
[1:08:26] baby yeah that's your baby but your baby
[1:08:28] just got
[1:08:31] sentence you gonna need some comary
[1:08:35] money but he didn't do that he was with
[1:08:38] them yeah he was
[1:08:40] there see we what we forget is birds of
[1:08:44] a feather have a tendency to flop
[1:08:46] together amen right but I didn't do
[1:08:49] nothing of it but my nephew told me
[1:08:52] Point Blank oh I was there I didn't pull
[1:08:55] P the trigger but I was
[1:08:57] there and you did 20 something years
[1:08:59] because you was there and a man
[1:09:04] died so we send the word to try to keep
[1:09:07] you from dying spiritually naturally
[1:09:10] amen there's a word God sent a word to
[1:09:13] heal us to see he already he already
[1:09:16] knows our condition amen amen he knows
[1:09:19] us far better than we know ourselves
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:24] amen do you know when you go to a doctor
[1:09:26] he can't do nothing for you till you
[1:09:28] open up and you tell him what the
[1:09:30] problem
[1:09:31] is he can start testing you for various
[1:09:35] things but if I'm dealing with
[1:09:37] circulation in my leg and he start
[1:09:39] checking my head that ain't going to
[1:09:41] help me too
[1:09:42] much but what happen he said okay Mr
[1:09:45] Moore what is the problem and then I
[1:09:47] tell them what I'm
[1:09:48] experiencing amen and then he began to
[1:09:51] treat me and examine know which area God
[1:09:55] already know what areas that you
[1:09:56] struggling with this
[1:09:58] morning amen he already knows
[1:10:03] am and when he Brother s said something
[1:10:06] I talked to him a couple of weeks ago he
[1:10:09] said brother do do do ministers pray to
[1:10:12] see to get a word for the people not
[1:10:15] just something you think going to sound
[1:10:19] good no it it doesn't it doesn't matter
[1:10:22] how it sounds if it's what the Lord put
[1:10:25] together for you am he said if you being
[1:10:29] invited to a person's house to eat the
[1:10:32] Bible says eat what's set before you
[1:10:33] that's right amen my wife said that's
[1:10:35] why I ain't going with you
[1:10:37] overseas I can't I said no it's best
[1:10:40] it's best for you not to
[1:10:43] go it's best for her not to go if I
[1:10:46] already know she a picky eater why am I
[1:10:48] going to take her somewhere where people
[1:10:49] ain't got much but they going to serve
[1:10:52] you what they have amen and and they
[1:10:54] going to eat what you eat amen and if I
[1:10:57] take that invitation then I'm going to
[1:11:00] sit there and eat what they eat amen if
[1:11:03] not they're going to be offended amen
[1:11:06] and when we come to the house of the
[1:11:07] Lord it might not be seasoned the way
[1:11:09] you want
[1:11:12] it it might not be but if you were
[1:11:15] invited to come and you came you it
[1:11:17] would you need to eat what's set before
[1:11:19] you why because the Lord knows every
[1:11:21] ingredient that's in
[1:11:23] here amen he knows every ingredient
[1:11:26] that's in this word amen he knows
[1:11:29] exactly what I need amen
[1:11:36] amen oh that men would give praise yes
[1:11:41] to the Lord for his
[1:11:42] goodness and
[1:11:44] for his wonderful
[1:11:47] Works to the children of men amen
[1:11:51] yes you know being raised in the church
[1:11:53] is one thing um
[1:11:58] but it it it requires a little bit more
[1:12:00] than
[1:12:02] that see this is not a um this is not an
[1:12:06] an an a pass down thing right though
[1:12:09] traditionally we can pass it down say
[1:12:12] yeah my people went to church I went my
[1:12:14] people went to baptist church so I went
[1:12:15] to Baptist Church we can pass that down
[1:12:18] but this experience is something you got
[1:12:20] to get for
[1:12:23] yourself God don't have grand children
[1:12:25] and stepchildren and no he got Sons and
[1:12:29] Daughters same way your mom and dad had
[1:12:31] to get it you got to get it amen amen
[1:12:34] they praying for you they got a hedge
[1:12:36] around you am amen but you can step
[1:12:39] beyond that hedge sometimes yes and then
[1:12:42] when things befall us we'll do what the
[1:12:44] scripture said in their distress then
[1:12:47] they cried out
[1:12:48] Mama you ever seen them grown men on on
[1:12:52] some of these uh shows they didn't got
[1:12:53] in trouble well can I call my
[1:12:56] mom you want to call Mama now you ain't
[1:12:59] talk to her in 6
[1:13:01] months but now you're in trouble you
[1:13:03] want to call
[1:13:05] Mom you know why cuz Mom will be right
[1:13:07] there to
[1:13:09] answer so God will always be right there
[1:13:13] amen it ain't no shortcoming in God
[1:13:16] brother and sister the shortcoming is in
[1:13:20] us the average man if I extend my hand
[1:13:23] to brother Simmons and wait for him to
[1:13:25] shake it I ain't going to wait for so
[1:13:28] long if he don't reciprocate if he don't
[1:13:31] meet me halfway then I'll say oh
[1:13:35] well but God is
[1:13:38] longsuffering patient since Calvary he
[1:13:41] been there with his arm wide
[1:13:44] open waiting
[1:13:48] patiently but men get tired oh man I'm
[1:13:50] through with them man I've been L how
[1:13:53] long Lord do I
[1:13:55] deal with this stiff necked rebellious
[1:13:58] people yes that's what the prophets of
[1:14:00] old times said how long Lord do I have
[1:14:03] to suffer these people that's
[1:14:06] right when it's Lord when it's the Lord
[1:14:09] imploring through the man to reach amen
[1:14:14] right yes because just just because a
[1:14:17] person stands up here does not mean that
[1:14:20] they're above you at all I preached in
[1:14:23] the maximum security prison for seven
[1:14:25] years um and they had a little platform
[1:14:29] pull pit like we I used to tell them put
[1:14:31] the put the thing down on the floor for
[1:14:33] me on on my Sunday when I come I want to
[1:14:35] be on the floor cuz I want to look them
[1:14:38] right in the eye because I came right
[1:14:39] out of the same situation that they came
[1:14:42] out
[1:14:43] of I I was no
[1:14:46] better than any of those men who were
[1:14:48] there some had life
[1:14:50] sentences um I was no better than any of
[1:14:52] them and I wanted to make sure they knew
[1:14:55] do that and because I could relate to
[1:14:58] them I there was a riot that's the only
[1:15:00] reason I'm not preaching there now they
[1:15:03] they killed four people I think it was
[1:15:04] in one
[1:15:06] day um and they kind of limited us from
[1:15:09] going there but I I firmly believe if I
[1:15:12] hadn't been there that day that Riot
[1:15:13] happened because those young men love me
[1:15:17] and I love them I believe I would have
[1:15:18] been
[1:15:19] protected and the next day I would have
[1:15:21] went in
[1:15:22] there because there was souls in there I
[1:15:25] was concerned
[1:15:27] about so many young sisters today um
[1:15:30] especially young black
[1:15:32] women single not a whole lot of eligible
[1:15:35] men
[1:15:36] out and when you stand and you look at a
[1:15:40] group of men that are come together on a
[1:15:41] Sunday and we we would sing We would
[1:15:44] pray preach the
[1:15:46] word and
[1:15:48] um I don't have any type of Tendencies
[1:15:51] at all but I'm saying here's a bunch of
[1:15:53] young healthy what some women might
[1:15:56] consider attractive men and they all
[1:15:59] locked
[1:16:00] up why because many times the word that
[1:16:03] was sent they didn't want to hear it but
[1:16:07] now in prison guess what happened the
[1:16:09] gifts
[1:16:11] flourish there was a there was a a a
[1:16:13] young man who had taught himself how to
[1:16:15] play the bass a young man played the
[1:16:17] organ um guys who could sing and I I
[1:16:22] there's not many people on the radio one
[1:16:24] guy in particular I'm thinking about
[1:16:27] that's all I had to tell him I said boy
[1:16:28] it ain't nobody on the radio that sound
[1:16:30] no better than you he would smile from
[1:16:32] ear to ear and then he was sing like an
[1:16:34] angel but he was locked up why because
[1:16:38] he failed to hear the word that was sent
[1:16:41] to heal
[1:16:44] him the day that you hear his
[1:16:50] voice right men young men especially we
[1:16:52] hard I I know I
[1:16:55] the stories I could tell about where
[1:16:57] I've been and what I've done so I'm not
[1:17:00] I'm not glorifying the enemy at
[1:17:02] all but the reality of it is we put on
[1:17:06] this mask right to blend all right and
[1:17:10] then now right because at an early age
[1:17:13] they are fed violence that's right
[1:17:16] that's right through TV Video Games
[1:17:21] music
[1:17:23] amen so it becomes the
[1:17:26] norm then we're not even going to talk
[1:17:28] about people being underprivileged and
[1:17:30] not having opportunities and not even
[1:17:32] having community centers for them to go
[1:17:35] you know let some of that energy out and
[1:17:37] they fall right into that vicious cycle
[1:17:40] that's right right but I was in that
[1:17:44] cycle don't stop praying for your
[1:17:47] children don't stop reaching out am
[1:17:51] don't shun them when they come and they
[1:17:53] ain't dressed right
[1:17:55] that's
[1:17:57] right no let them come if they willing
[1:17:59] to come let them come amen amen but show
[1:18:02] them some
[1:18:04] love my wife sang a song Last who will
[1:18:07] be Jesus to them amen who show the love
[1:18:11] that will restore them once again see
[1:18:14] Jesus said with loving kindness have I
[1:18:18] drawn them amen I'm this is a testimony
[1:18:21] real quick there was a young man um and
[1:18:25] as a matter of fact it's very it's very
[1:18:26] relevant right now there's a young man
[1:18:28] and his wife that I had met and they
[1:18:30] were doing Street
[1:18:32] Ministry and when I had started my
[1:18:34] church your pastor had blessed me with a
[1:18:37] sound
[1:18:38] system just something to get started
[1:18:40] with but it was perfect for what we had
[1:18:44] and he said Brother Moore all I want you
[1:18:46] to do is when you
[1:18:48] upgrade bless somebody else he said give
[1:18:52] it to somebody else and so when we got
[1:18:55] ready to upgrade that couple was the
[1:18:57] first couple that I thought about and so
[1:18:59] I gave him that sound system and they'
[1:19:02] go set up on the street corner and they
[1:19:05] put up a tent and the lady would cook
[1:19:08] two or three big pans of spaghetti and
[1:19:10] make garlic bread and have something to
[1:19:12] drink and just invite anybody to come
[1:19:15] and they would sing and
[1:19:18] preach and I thought about what brother
[1:19:21] Simmons had told me see you you passing
[1:19:23] it on to somebody else El they might not
[1:19:25] ever come set their foot in my
[1:19:28] church that's not what it's all about I
[1:19:30] didn't give them that to try to draw
[1:19:31] them to come with me no keep doing what
[1:19:34] you doing amen if God put you out there
[1:19:36] God will bless it am amen but we went to
[1:19:40] set up a
[1:19:42] cookout right dead in the
[1:19:45] heart of where the Crips conducted their
[1:19:49] business and because Russell was from
[1:19:52] the street and because I was from the
[1:19:54] street R said I'm going just go talk at
[1:19:56] I'm going to go holl at him and he went
[1:19:58] and talk and I saw him talking to the
[1:20:00] young man
[1:20:01] and uh he didn't look like he was
[1:20:04] upset but he just was accepting he
[1:20:07] nodding a little bit and then when he
[1:20:09] came back he said we
[1:20:11] good as long as you trying to do
[1:20:14] something positive for the
[1:20:16] community you good how long y'all going
[1:20:20] to
[1:20:21] be they shut down they shut down all
[1:20:23] their activity
[1:20:25] for that whole afternoon and they stood
[1:20:27] over at the corner store and they just
[1:20:29] watched us for a
[1:20:31] while right and about an hour and a half
[1:20:35] in here they come across the
[1:20:38] street and they get up and I tapped them
[1:20:41] up and showed him some love and talked
[1:20:43] to him and sat him down and ate a
[1:20:46] plate of food right that don't mean that
[1:20:50] they ran to my church or they ran to his
[1:20:52] church afterward no but they heard
[1:20:55] something that they might not have heard
[1:20:56] at
[1:20:57] home man we love you bro that's right I
[1:21:02] understand some of the stuff they doing
[1:21:04] don't don't scratch the tip of the
[1:21:06] iceberg what I
[1:21:08] did and the grace of God kept me from
[1:21:12] Jes still being out there amen all
[1:21:16] because it was a word that was
[1:21:18] sent and that word found its
[1:21:22] place and I began to hear and I began to
[1:21:25] take heed and then he sent me my
[1:21:28] wife who I did everything and she did
[1:21:32] nothing opposites ATT
[1:21:35] trct and she helped pull me right away
[1:21:37] from that life till I didn't want to be
[1:21:40] out there no more amen amen so when she
[1:21:44] didn't want to go out I said well let me
[1:21:46] go to plan B I didn't want Plan B amen I
[1:21:49] didn't want to call this one and call
[1:21:51] that one if I couldn't be with her I
[1:21:52] didn't I'm staying home
[1:21:55] amen and it was all because the Lord was
[1:21:58] still ministering my mom met my wife he
[1:22:01] said why don't you make her your
[1:22:02] girlriend I said that's my friend make
[1:22:05] her your girlfriend she knew more than I
[1:22:08] knew we've been together 40
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:12] years all because you listen sometimes
[1:22:16] the Lord is speaking to you when you
[1:22:18] least
[1:22:20] expected that's right some of the ones
[1:22:22] you might think do you know the world
[1:22:24] will hold you to a higher standard
[1:22:26] sometime than you hold
[1:22:29] yourself I had a sinner correct me on
[1:22:32] the
[1:22:32] job he said all Mr so and so would broke
[1:22:35] down man I ride right past him I said I
[1:22:37] would too he said wait a minute preacher
[1:22:40] wait a minute hold it hold
[1:22:44] it you said it's okay for me to say that
[1:22:46] but you can't I said yeah you right I
[1:22:48] had to
[1:22:50] repent they will hold you to a higher
[1:22:52] standard
[1:22:56] because what you say people expect you
[1:22:58] to manifest
[1:23:01] it don't be telling me about Jesus
[1:23:03] Christ and you ain't trying to live like
[1:23:05] him
[1:23:06] am truth brother you trying to do
[1:23:09] everything that I
[1:23:11] do they buffing to you in the club oh no
[1:23:15] uhuh uh-uh you can't win them I don't
[1:23:18] want the recer when I done ran off the
[1:23:21] road and I'm stuck I don't want the
[1:23:23] record to back down there where I'm at I
[1:23:26] want him to stay up there on Solid
[1:23:27] Ground send a cable down or something
[1:23:30] pull me out don't come down here with me
[1:23:33] I'm already
[1:23:35] stuck we can't win them with the world
[1:23:39] we got to win them with the
[1:23:43] word and not not just a word spoken do
[1:23:46] you know why because the Bible says the
[1:23:48] letter kth uhhuh but the spirit gives
[1:23:51] life in other words somebody want to see
[1:23:53] you manifest has something live what you
[1:23:56] talking about and then you might
[1:23:58] persuade somebody
[1:24:01] amen King AG gripper said Paul you
[1:24:03] almost you almost persuaded me to be a
[1:24:06] Christian amen why his life yes here I'm
[1:24:11] going to close with this cuz I had more
[1:24:12] but I'm I'm going to close with this
[1:24:14] turn to St John chapter one and because
[1:24:17] we have read this scripture we have read
[1:24:19] it and read it and read it and for some
[1:24:22] reason um
[1:24:24] sometimes the emphasis doesn't land
[1:24:26] where it
[1:24:30] should St John chapter
[1:24:36] 1 see
[1:24:38] there Jesus had a Ministry an Earthly
[1:24:42] Ministry that only lasted three and a
[1:24:44] half years amen but look the effect of
[1:24:47] it is still going on today amen three
[1:24:50] and A2
[1:24:51] years but the effects are still
[1:24:55] going on today am the the number one
[1:24:57] selling book of all time will always be
[1:25:00] the Bible amen you see every year oh New
[1:25:04] York's bestseller new I don't none of
[1:25:06] them talk the word
[1:25:08] amen in the beginning God said let there
[1:25:11] be light guess what it's still
[1:25:14] light you can't stop his
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:18] word but we sometime we underestimate
[1:25:21] the the power that's in the word amen
[1:25:24] than thank you sometime we underestimate
[1:25:27] it right singing it quoting it and
[1:25:29] everything but we underestimate it when
[1:25:32] we fail to apply it to our
[1:25:37] situation St John 1 right very familiar
[1:25:41] but I want you to look at it not
[1:25:44] different but in a in a different light
[1:25:47] okay in the beginning was the word amen
[1:25:53] right and what a word is you you ever
[1:25:56] been you ever had a thought in your mind
[1:25:58] and you
[1:26:01] said you heard people say I speak my
[1:26:04] mind well if the word is in your mind
[1:26:08] you ever spoke
[1:26:11] it a word is a thought that that you
[1:26:14] express when you speak it so in the
[1:26:17] beginning God said let there be light it
[1:26:18] was a thought initially but when he
[1:26:20] spoke it it became a word it became
[1:26:22] material it became real
[1:26:24] amen amen not just a thought okay so in
[1:26:28] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:26:30] was with God and the Word was God Amen
[1:26:37] the same word
[1:26:39] amen how can a book how can a book be
[1:26:42] God it's the
[1:26:43] word we not going to get into the Greek
[1:26:46] and the logos and all that we're not
[1:26:48] getting in all that but the word right
[1:26:51] this same word is God in print amen it's
[1:26:54] the thoughts of God that were expressed
[1:26:57] okay now if you were a thought of God
[1:27:00] you are the word that's watch because
[1:27:03] your life has to fulfill the scripture
[1:27:05] think about this for a minute um
[1:27:08] everybody thinks about all the things
[1:27:09] that Jesus said right but what was more
[1:27:13] in more powerful was the things that he
[1:27:16] did watch the same was in the beginning
[1:27:19] with God all things were made by him and
[1:27:23] without him was not anything made that
[1:27:25] was made here is here is the theme
[1:27:29] that's written on the window on the post
[1:27:31] in the window in my church in him was
[1:27:35] life amen and his life was the light of
[1:27:40] men think about it it it didn't say just
[1:27:44] his word but it said in him was life and
[1:27:47] his life was the light of men so if you
[1:27:51] come around bringing the light and
[1:27:52] people in darkness light always conquers
[1:27:55] Darkness
[1:27:57] amen how come we ain't winning are we
[1:28:00] manifesting the
[1:28:01] light how come we ain't drawing more
[1:28:03] people out of Darkness are we
[1:28:05] manifesting the light amen now I'm not
[1:28:08] talking about your church doctrine or
[1:28:10] are we manifesting the light you said
[1:28:13] well how can I do
[1:28:16] that the light verse 5 says and the
[1:28:19] light shineth in darkness and the
[1:28:21] Darkness comprehended it not but when
[1:28:23] you go go down in verse 14 right the
[1:28:26] Word was God but watch what happened to
[1:28:30] the word it wasn't just good enough to
[1:28:33] be first thought not just good enough
[1:28:36] just to be spoken but now guess what's
[1:28:39] got to happen and the Word was made
[1:28:44] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:28:48] his glory the glory as of the only
[1:28:51] begotten of the father full
[1:28:54] of Grace and Truth so did that just stop
[1:28:56] with
[1:28:57] Jesus no the word must be made flesh
[1:29:00] again in you am let your light so shine
[1:29:05] amen it's all about the life brothers
[1:29:08] and sister he sent his word to instruct
[1:29:10] us what his life is like amen he sent
[1:29:14] his word to heal us when we were in sin
[1:29:17] amen and he sent his word for us to
[1:29:20] manifest Christ am somebody ought to see
[1:29:23] Christ in you why because Christ in you
[1:29:26] brings them hope
[1:29:29] amen if they if they knew me from the
[1:29:32] street and what I
[1:29:34] did and now they see my life has changed
[1:29:37] they see Christ in
[1:29:39] me Christ in you will give them hope
[1:29:43] amen man I can change amen I ain't got
[1:29:46] to stay out here man amen
[1:29:50] amen amen there is hope what when I was
[1:29:54] in the world and I realized the thing
[1:29:56] had got to the point where you either
[1:29:58] had to be willing to kill or be
[1:30:02] killed you had to take that
[1:30:05] chance somebody somebody scheming on
[1:30:07] what you got some of your so-called
[1:30:10] friends want what you

[1:30:30] and I don't want nobody to hurt
[1:30:32] me but they hadin got that serious too
[1:30:35] much money

[1:30:40] respected and be tough most of them if
[1:30:43] they didn't have that gun they won't

[1:33:20] constantly put people in my path amen to
[1:33:24] speak the
[1:33:25] word right cuz words have
[1:33:29] power right and and when you hold on to
[1:33:32] some of the things that you heard even
[1:33:34] this morning it it might not ad meit a
[1:33:36] whole lot to you but put it in your
[1:33:39] pocket what maybe something you heard
[1:33:41] this morning put it in your pocket amen
[1:33:43] you ever put something in your pocket of
[1:33:45] value and went when you went back to
[1:33:47] that pants pocket oh Lord I didn't know
[1:33:50] that was in there
[1:33:53] you might not have needed it right now
[1:33:56] but later on something that you heard
[1:33:57] today you might need it amen amen the
[1:34:01] word is Perpetual right it's it's
[1:34:05] Eternal it it doesn't
[1:34:08] stop and at the very hour when you think
[1:34:11] not
[1:34:13] Jesus you might need that oh
[1:34:17] yes I can remember so many things my
[1:34:21] mama said my granddaddy said you said
[1:34:24] boy sometime a man got to do something
[1:34:26] even if it's wrong I didn't know what he
[1:34:27] meant I know what he mean now bless we
[1:34:31] got a family take care of you got to do
[1:34:35] something but I'm so grateful that I
[1:34:37] took the time to pay attention to what
[1:34:40] was told to me by people that I knew who
[1:34:44] love me
[1:34:46] amen the church these ministers those
[1:34:50] who labor among you believe it they love
[1:34:53] you
[1:34:55] because they're concerned about your
[1:34:57] soul and and that's that's the most
[1:35:00] important attribute for your leader any
[1:35:03] leader is that they have your best
[1:35:05] interest at heart I don't care if it's
[1:35:07] on your job wherever it is that they
[1:35:10] have your best interest at heart and if
[1:35:12] they don't then they'll just use you
[1:35:15] up but somebody who concerned about you
[1:35:17] want to see you thrive do good and avoid
[1:35:21] a lot of these pitfalls in life amen so
[1:35:24] God bless you this morning um I know he
[1:35:27] sent his word when I was in the system
[1:35:30] lock down thinking I was on my way to
[1:35:33] heaven but I W even doing what the word
[1:35:37] said and I asked the pastor about why
[1:35:39] why are we doing this and the Bible said
[1:35:41] don't do this why are we doing that and
[1:35:43] the Bible said don't do
[1:35:46] that and I got excuses and and then the
[1:35:49] Lord sent a word to me amen and that
[1:35:52] word healed me amen took me back to the
[1:35:55] Bible and I'm so grateful for that this
[1:35:58] morning because it turned my whole life
[1:36:01] around so this morning let's stand to
[1:36:03] our feet it's afternoon
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:08] now I told you I wasn't going to run you
[1:36:11] up and down the aisles you didn't run um
[1:36:14] You probably get that maybe in another
[1:36:16] service but I've always been a type of
[1:36:19] person that I want to um
[1:36:24] speak in such a way that what I
[1:36:27] say might stay with somebody amen or
[1:36:31] make them think a little
[1:36:32] bit right because it takes God can't no
[1:36:36] man give you a revelation amen the best
[1:36:38] preacher that you know he can't give you
[1:36:41] a
[1:36:42] revelation only God can do
[1:36:45] that but if a man can say something to
[1:36:47] make you go back and look in that book
[1:36:49] for
[1:36:50] yourself right that's a good thing
[1:36:52] because the Bible says search the
[1:36:54] scriptures for yourself amen for in them
[1:36:59] you
[1:37:01] think that you have don't that sound
[1:37:03] kind of sketchy I well I think I got it
[1:37:07] I don't want to think I got it am I want
[1:37:09] to know and the only way I'll know I got
[1:37:12] to search that word for myself so God
