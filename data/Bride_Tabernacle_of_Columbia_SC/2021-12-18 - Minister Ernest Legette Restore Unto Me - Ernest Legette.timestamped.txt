[34:58] amen
[34:59] i like how that song says when my heart
[35:02] is overwhelmed lead me to the rock
[35:05] i thought about
[35:06] something i was talking
[35:08] to one of my brothers this week
[35:10] and
[35:11] last week
[35:12] at least last week and he was saying to
[35:14] me it's like man
[35:16] he said i just need somebody to talk to
[35:20] so
[35:20] i was talking with him he said you ever
[35:22] been like that well you just needed to
[35:23] relieve some
[35:25] something
[35:26] just get some relief just to have
[35:27] somebody to talk to and vent to is the
[35:30] word he used
[35:31] i told him i get like that all the time
[35:33] he said well who do you talk to
[35:36] i said i get down on my knees in prayer
[35:38] and i let it all go to god
[35:41] he said to me cause he called me
[35:43] germaine he said jermaine
[35:45] come on man i'm serious quit joking
[35:47] i said i'm serious
[35:49] i said he never felt that whenever i
[35:52] needed relief
[35:53] or whenever i needed answers
[35:56] when i just didn't know where to turn
[35:59] i told him i said now i can talk to
[36:01] charlotte my wife
[36:02] i could tell her anything and we can
[36:04] talk about it i said but when i needed
[36:06] real relief
[36:08] when i needed a real shoulder to crown
[36:10] come on
[36:12] when i needed to vent
[36:15] i said i did it dialed on my knees in
[36:17] prayer
[36:18] and i still do it now and i said he
[36:20] never he never failed me yet
[36:22] i said so you know i said that's what it
[36:25] is the power of getting down on our
[36:27] knees
[36:28] the devil he wants you to keep carrying
[36:30] them burdens
[36:32] he wants you to keep carrying them
[36:33] heartaches and that pain
[36:35] he wants you to keep carrying it and
[36:37] that's why he blocked your prayer life
[36:38] you believe that that's why he don't
[36:40] want you to get down on your knees and
[36:42] tell god about it come on
[36:44] he don't mind you telling everybody else
[36:47] because he know that they can't help you
[36:49] come on
[36:50] but when you tell god about it he don't
[36:53] want that because i like that song that
[36:55] says let god arise and my enemies be
[36:58] scattered
[36:59] because when god arrives
[37:01] all of my cloudy days come on they'll go
[37:04] away all my enemies will be scattered
[37:06] when god get up hallelujah
[37:08] do you believe that tonight
[37:10] so i challenge you i says that you know
[37:12] when my heart is overwhelmed as the
[37:14] songs say lead us to the rock
[37:16] i was challenging him i said you know
[37:18] just as you vent to me vent the guard
[37:20] that way
[37:21] and tell them all about it come on i
[37:23] said i i guarantee you he won't fail you
[37:26] do you believe that tonight
[37:29] amen psalms 51 by the grace of god
[37:34] you got to say amen
[37:36] and it reads
[37:38] have mercy upon me oh god according to
[37:41] thy love and kindness how many want
[37:43] mercy tonight
[37:45] he says according to the multitude of
[37:48] thy tender mercies blot out my
[37:50] transgressions
[37:52] wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[37:54] cleanse me from my sin you may be seated
[37:57] we'll read a little further down
[38:01] it says in
[38:02] for i acknowledge my transgressions
[38:05] and my sin
[38:07] is ever before me
[38:08] against thee be only have i sinned and
[38:12] done this evil in thy sight that thou
[38:14] mightest be justified when thou speakest
[38:17] and be clear when thou judges
[38:20] behold i was shaping in iniquity and in
[38:23] sinned and my mother conceived me
[38:25] behold
[38:26] thou desirest truth in the inward parts
[38:29] and in the hidden part thou shalt make
[38:32] me to know wisdom
[38:34] purge me with hyssop and i shall be
[38:37] clean
[38:38] wash me and i shall be whiter than snow
[38:41] make me to hear
[38:43] joy and gladness that the bones which
[38:46] thou has broken may rejoice hide thy
[38:49] face from my sins and blot out all my
[38:51] enemies i like this in the 10th verse he
[38:54] says
[38:55] create in me a clean heart
[38:57] o god
[38:58] and renew a right spirit in me how many
[39:00] want god to do that tonight
[39:02] come on restore unto me
[39:05] the joy of my salvation
[39:08] and uphold me with thy free spirit then
[39:11] will i teach transgressors thy ways and
[39:14] sinners shall be converted unto thee
[39:17] unto thee deliver me from
[39:20] blood guiltness o god thou god of my
[39:23] salvation and my tongue shall sing
[39:27] aloud of thy righteousness
[39:30] tonight by the god by god's grace we
[39:32] want to just minister on to
[39:34] minister
[39:35] for a moment on restore unto me amen
[39:39] you know david here
[39:41] and we'll just we'll just skip down
[39:44] to the
[39:45] to the
[39:46] i say the meat part
[39:48] david said unto me david said restore
[39:51] unto me
[39:52] my joy come on
[39:54] david wanted his joy back
[39:57] you know we live in an age and
[40:00] a time i would say that where it's a lot
[40:02] of pain
[40:04] i was praying one day a couple of weeks
[40:05] ago and i couldn't get it out of my
[40:08] spirit i said lord that's a lot of pain
[40:10] out there
[40:11] it's a lot of hurt
[40:14] everywhere you you look it's pain
[40:17] somebody's going through somewhere
[40:19] i was sharing with somebody i said you
[40:21] know when you try to encourage this one
[40:24] and help this one get back level
[40:26] the ship then you turn around and look
[40:29] and somebody else is sinking
[40:31] i says but everywhere you turn it's a
[40:34] lot of pain
[40:35] but god you know he spoke something down
[40:38] in my spirit
[40:39] and
[40:41] he was telling me that he's the reliever
[40:43] of the pain come on
[40:45] that
[40:46] if the people would only come to him
[40:49] he can heal them everywhere they hurt
[40:51] and i believe that tonight
[40:53] a lot of times you know
[40:56] we could go to god and god could do
[40:58] great things for us
[40:59] reminded me of one time the king sent
[41:02] to uh think it was beelzebub or one of
[41:05] the other gods to see if he would be
[41:07] healed from the sickness he was in
[41:10] but when the prophet met him first thing
[41:12] he asked him he said why come on
[41:15] he says is there no bomb in gilead
[41:18] come on is there no physician there
[41:22] and if there is then why come on why
[41:25] aren't you healed tonight
[41:26] why are you going other places seeking
[41:29] deliverance
[41:30] come on and i said that even today
[41:33] god is still that same god
[41:36] god is still a healer
[41:37] he's still a deliverer isn't he
[41:40] ain't he the same yesterday today and
[41:42] forever
[41:44] i said is he still all-powerful
[41:46] then why aren't we healed tonight come
[41:49] on
[41:49] why don't we have the joy of the lord in
[41:52] our hearts
[41:53] why aren't we glad
[41:55] come on as david said when they said
[41:57] unto me let us go into the house of the
[41:59] lord
[42:00] somewhere we lost our joy
[42:03] i was talking to brother damien
[42:05] and he was saying to me
[42:07] brother ernest he says
[42:09] we got to have fun with our salvation
[42:12] we got to enjoy being saved
[42:16] he said if i can't have fun being saved
[42:18] then it ain't no good to me
[42:20] come on
[42:21] because when i was out in the world
[42:23] i enjoyed being out in the world come on
[42:26] living for the devil
[42:28] well how much
[42:29] much more right now we have the joy of
[42:31] the lord
[42:32] knowing hallelujah that we found
[42:35] immortality
[42:38] that we found hallelujah the tree of
[42:40] life that we can eat and live forever
[42:43] we don't have to be afraid to die
[42:45] because we know what's on the other side
[42:48] come on we live in this life just so we
[42:50] can live and again live again
[42:52] i believe the song says living he loves
[42:54] me dying he saved me
[42:56] buried come on
[42:58] he carried my sins far away
[43:00] rising he justified him freed me forever
[43:03] and one day he's coming what a glorious
[43:05] day
[43:06] hallelujah what are we happy about
[43:09] because we know where we're going
[43:11] we know where our home is hallelujah and
[43:13] we know who our father is do you believe
[43:15] that tonight
[43:17] come on but you got to have joy with
[43:19] your salvation
[43:21] come on you got to enjoy being saved you
[43:25] know us thinking about even in a
[43:27] marriage
[43:28] when you lose that joy in the marriage
[43:31] when you lose that like the scripture
[43:33] says they left their first love when you
[43:36] lose that first love
[43:38] or when you looked in our eyes and
[43:39] something caught your attention
[43:42] way it didn't matter all you just want
[43:44] to do is be around that special someone
[43:47] come on because you enjoyed being around
[43:49] them
[43:50] hearing their voice hallelujah being in
[43:52] their presence
[43:54] but when you're in a relationship and
[43:56] you lose that come on i believe you in a
[43:58] dangerous grounds then
[44:00] you know i was listening to a testimony
[44:02] of somebody in their 90s
[44:03] they've been married uh
[44:05] well there was there was over 100
[44:07] they've been married 80-something years
[44:09] come on and they asked them they said
[44:11] could you give the young people some
[44:13] some uh uh
[44:15] wisdom on how y'all stayed together so
[44:17] long
[44:18] well the one thing they said
[44:20] they said the reason why we stayed
[44:22] together so long we never went to bed uh
[44:25] upset with each other
[44:27] said no matter what we've been through
[44:28] through that day or what disagreements
[44:30] we had we never laid down without making
[44:33] those things right
[44:34] even if we couldn't find out who was
[44:36] right or wrong we just uh solved the
[44:38] solution and we woke up started the next
[44:40] day as it was new come on but they said
[44:42] that that's the best advice that they
[44:44] can give them
[44:46] what i say is that when when you lose
[44:48] that joy even in a natural marriage when
[44:51] you lose that
[44:52] come on i believe then you're on
[44:54] dangerous grounds
[44:56] because somebody then you lost to joy
[44:58] you go seek out that elsewhere
[45:01] come on
[45:02] but not only is that in the natural but
[45:04] it's even that in the spiritual realm
[45:06] when you lose that joy come on
[45:10] of coming to the house of god when you
[45:11] lose that joy
[45:13] of striving to be in his presence what
[45:15] you're going to do you're going to look
[45:16] for it elsewhere the church world as a
[45:18] whole lost it and that's why they
[45:20] brought in entertainment
[45:22] come on
[45:23] why
[45:24] because they lost the real presence of
[45:26] god and in all reality do they want it i
[45:29] don't know
[45:30] you say why because when the real
[45:32] presence of god come down what does it
[45:34] do it cleans up lives
[45:37] it straightens out homes it puts
[45:39] marriages back together it causes you to
[45:42] repent and say lord here i am creating
[45:45] me a clean heart when the real presents
[45:47] come down
[45:48] and they don't want it why because
[45:50] they're enjoying the pleasures of sin
[45:52] come on
[45:53] but i don't know about you but i
[45:55] preached a message
[45:57] one time
[45:58] about about the withdrawal effects
[46:01] come on and i says that you know once a
[46:03] person get addicted to drugs and things
[46:06] that withdraw for them they go through
[46:07] all kind of changes
[46:09] their body go through all kind of
[46:11] withdrawal effects
[46:12] and i said i don't know about you but
[46:14] when i ain't in the presence of god i
[46:16] start going through withdrawal effects
[46:18] when i can't feel his presence near i
[46:21] start going through withdrawal effects
[46:23] when i don't have my joy i start going
[46:25] through withdrawal effects and i start
[46:28] getting down on my knees searching
[46:30] lord where did i lose it at
[46:32] hallelujah
[46:34] you know some people if they don't if
[46:36] they don't uh satisfy those addictions
[46:39] they'll die come on they'll lose their
[46:41] mind they start hallucinating
[46:44] a friend of mine told me about snorting
[46:46] cocaine he says the thing is in the
[46:49] crack smoking crack he says it takes you
[46:52] to such a high
[46:53] he says you're here and it lifts you
[46:56] here
[46:56] and he says when you hear you all right
[46:58] when you hear you're all right he says
[47:00] but when you're coming down it's the in
[47:01] between
[47:03] he said that in between are coming down
[47:05] because you your body
[47:07] or your spirit got to such a place that
[47:09] that in between
[47:11] it makes you a a nervous wreck and he
[47:13] said you'll do anything to get back here
[47:15] come on and some of them they they wish
[47:18] they had never uh got to that place
[47:21] because now they hooked
[47:23] come on
[47:24] and i said that that's even
[47:26] here
[47:28] within our lives we're looking at
[47:30] natural death but it causes spiritual
[47:32] death come on
[47:34] that in between
[47:36] oh jesus
[47:37] but i said lord lift us up
[47:39] hallelujah bring us to that place to
[47:42] where god we're on that high all the
[47:44] time come on and even when we come down
[47:47] we don't go down but we come back up
[47:49] lord dip us again i said that's what we
[47:51] need uh i was i was uh praying the other
[47:54] day i was saying lord we need another
[47:56] sweep of the holy ghost
[47:59] we need a sweep of the power
[48:02] i said god the young people need to see
[48:04] it
[48:05] because god if you don't do something
[48:07] right now we're going to lose them all
[48:10] i'm afraid i don't know about you but
[48:12] i'm afraid for my home
[48:14] i'm afraid for my children that if god
[48:17] don't do something hallelujah he don't
[48:19] come to the rescue we'll lose him all
[48:22] do you believe that tonight sometimes we
[48:25] don't want to admit it but it's the
[48:26] truth anyhow we need god to come in
[48:30] i don't know about you but i was praying
[48:31] the other day i said raising children
[48:33] god i need you lord to help me i don't
[48:35] know how to raise them i don't know what
[48:37] to say come on
[48:39] i need your help
[48:41] i was i started singing that little song
[48:43] in my prayer help me help me lord
[48:48] because i'm pretty real
[48:49] i don't know about you but i need god's
[48:51] help
[48:52] you know and i says that come on
[48:55] i'll just just go on down i says you
[48:57] know
[48:58] uh david was praying for his joy
[49:02] he was saying lord i want my joy back
[49:04] ain't that what he was saying
[49:06] so
[49:07] i asked a question
[49:08] i said where have you lost your joy
[49:12] where is your love for god
[49:14] gone what took it away
[49:17] come on
[49:18] you know what i said the world can't
[49:19] give it and the world can't take it away
[49:21] or what took girls away
[49:23] come on
[49:24] i thought about i said a lot of times
[49:27] the the the of life when we left out on
[49:30] that don't you know we missed out on a
[49:32] lot of things
[49:34] we don't understand
[49:35] the power of prayer
[49:37] to the full magnitude i don't believe we
[49:39] do
[49:40] come on
[49:42] i said the other week i was i was
[49:44] preaching on troubled times i said what
[49:46] did the people do all through the
[49:48] scriptures during troubled times they
[49:50] prayed
[49:52] they found some way to get down on their
[49:54] knees
[49:55] and cry out to god in trouble times and
[49:58] god never failed to answer them when
[50:00] they cried in troubled times
[50:02] i said what what does prayer do how
[50:05] powerful prayer is
[50:07] you know prayer is so powerful jesus
[50:09] used it
[50:11] come on i believe that jesus could look
[50:14] into what was coming
[50:16] and he began to tell uh peter he said
[50:19] the devil desire to sift you as wheat
[50:21] come on i see
[50:23] what's up the road for you
[50:25] come on he said but nevertheless i would
[50:29] i prayed for you come on
[50:31] i said prayer must be powerful
[50:34] that jesus prayed for somebody come on
[50:37] that your faith wouldn't fail you i said
[50:39] what did you what's the secret that
[50:41] jesus knew about prayer that we don't
[50:43] know hallelujah
[50:45] i believe jesus knew that when he prayed
[50:48] demons trembled
[50:50] hallelujah it invited the angels of god
[50:53] come near
[50:54] oh jesus
[50:56] prayer is powerful
[50:58] you know me and my wife the other day
[51:00] was uh on the way to work and i mean on
[51:02] the way to the church and thinking about
[51:05] how they had that other mass shooting up
[51:07] there in michigan i think it was in the
[51:09] school
[51:11] and i was telling her i was saying that
[51:13] when i was young i remember when i first
[51:14] started school
[51:16] and how every morning over the intercom
[51:18] down there in mullins they would say a
[51:20] prayer
[51:21] somebody would get up there and have to
[51:23] be nothing deep
[51:25] something simple like lord
[51:27] help us today
[51:28] watch over the children
[51:30] watch over the teachers
[51:32] come on but i said that little bit
[51:35] was powerful
[51:37] we're we seeing now how much that little
[51:39] bit uh affected the school don't we
[51:42] i believe we're seeing the effects of
[51:44] how that little bit taken away
[51:47] did
[51:48] come on
[51:49] i said lord
[51:51] why
[51:52] would a man
[51:54] want to take that away
[51:56] come on
[51:57] take that away from the school system to
[52:00] ask god to watch over the children
[52:03] and watch over the teachers why
[52:06] come on had to be demons and devils
[52:09] to get prayer out of the schools right i
[52:11] said but even though i was taken out of
[52:13] the schools it didn't have to be taken
[52:14] out your home
[52:16] you can still pray in your home
[52:19] god help my children today god help all
[52:22] the children today help the teachers
[52:24] hallelujah
[52:26] my daughter uh
[52:28] mary
[52:30] last night was talking about dad we did
[52:33] an active shooter drill at school
[52:36] and i said
[52:37] it's a dark world we live in
[52:40] to wait now
[52:41] uh uh uh it's got to be uh
[52:44] added
[52:45] to the drills not a fire drill tornado
[52:48] but an active shooter drill
[52:50] because the world has got that dark
[52:54] the way it's the potential that any day
[52:57] somebody can come in here and shoot the
[52:58] schoolhouse up
[53:00] oh dark world we live in
[53:03] hallelujah
[53:05] do we need god's protection yes we need
[53:08] god protection we don't understand how
[53:11] much we need god's grace
[53:13] we don't understand how much that blood
[53:15] mean to us
[53:17] we don't understand how much that prayer
[53:19] means
[53:20] do you believe that come on
[53:22] i said the world has gotten that dark
[53:26] so i said that
[53:27] look they got to conduct active shooter
[53:29] drills
[53:31] because they know
[53:32] that we're living in a world full of
[53:33] maniacs
[53:35] we're living in a world that's gone
[53:37] completely insane
[53:40] they know that come on but they'll tell
[53:43] you
[53:44] everything is all right we got it under
[53:45] control come on i only know one that can
[53:48] right the ship
[53:49] i only know one that's got it all in
[53:51] control you can say what you want but
[53:53] i'm gonna put my life and the life of my
[53:55] family in his hands
[53:57] because i know
[53:58] hallelujah
[54:02] that he is king come on do you believe
[54:04] that tonight
[54:06] somehow to give god praise amen
[54:09] come on like i said i just know i
[54:13] skipped down i says
[54:15] you know i didn't want to be long
[54:17] what took the joy
[54:19] of your salvation come on
[54:21] say the people just ain't happy no more
[54:24] come on say i'm happy may come and
[54:27] spurts but people just ain't happy
[54:29] come on
[54:30] i look at my own
[54:32] life
[54:33] i say what took it away
[54:35] was it money come on
[54:37] david had to have to come to the
[54:39] reckoning of where he lost his joy at
[54:42] come on didn't he
[54:44] david first thing he began to do was
[54:47] repent
[54:48] come on because he realized that sin
[54:51] took his joy away
[54:53] come on
[54:56] when he used to when he saw the ark he
[54:58] was out there dancing why because he had
[55:00] the joy
[55:01] come on
[55:02] he wrote all these psalms why because he
[55:04] had the joy
[55:06] but it came a place in his life where
[55:09] the joy was taken away
[55:11] sin took the joy away
[55:14] didn't it
[55:15] i said did sin take your jaw away come
[55:18] on sometimes we got to reckon with
[55:20] ourselves
[55:21] lord where's my joy going
[55:24] the real joy not the imitation the real
[55:27] thing not entertainment
[55:31] the real presence
[55:34] the holy spirit as they say you're
[55:36] welcome and he would come down and rest
[55:38] on you
[55:39] the real joy
[55:41] lord i want something to shake my inner
[55:44] core
[55:45] i believe david said lord you know me
[55:48] how i was born in the iniquity and all
[55:50] these things god you know me
[55:53] help me
[55:54] deliver me from myself
[55:56] i said god i want to be delivered from
[55:59] myself nobody else is the reason you
[56:02] don't have your joy you are your worst
[56:04] enemy
[56:05] come on
[56:08] i pray tonight that we all find our joy
[56:10] back pray tonight that we all found that
[56:13] place
[56:15] the way we fall in love with god again
[56:18] we can get down on our knees and cry out
[56:20] like we ain't never cried out before
[56:22] why because we love him
[56:25] we don't mind staying all night
[56:27] we don't mind telling somebody about the
[56:29] goodness of jesus and all he done for us
[56:32] because if it was for him
[56:35] i'd be dead somewhere in my grave
[56:38] the other day i was telling my wife
[56:41] something happened to me the lord
[56:44] allowed me to go see some things and
[56:47] but when i was coming home
[56:49] he began to open my eyes
[56:52] to
[56:54] just how much he's blessed us
[56:57] you look at natural things but i ain't
[56:59] necessarily talking about that
[57:02] i'm talking about
[57:03] in life in general
[57:05] you think you got struggles and you
[57:07] think you're going through but sometimes
[57:10] god got to let you look at your brethren
[57:14] not saying my natural brothers i don't
[57:16] want that to go out like that
[57:18] but i believe that you know what happens
[57:21] a lot of times
[57:22] we got selfish motives and objectives we
[57:26] got selfish attitudes
[57:29] because we ain't out in the forefront
[57:31] so sometimes
[57:33] we think people forgot about us
[57:36] come on god ain't blessing us
[57:39] but nevertheless
[57:40] he said i'll never leave you nor forsake
[57:43] you
[57:44] when all forget you you graved in the
[57:46] palm of my hand i won't forget you
[57:48] that means more to me than anything the
[57:50] world has to offer that god will still
[57:53] remember me
[57:54] hallelujah
[57:56] oh jesus
[57:58] come on
[57:59] but he began to
[58:01] open my eyes to some things
[58:03] i thought about the scripture
[58:05] how
[58:06] uh uh god told the children of israel he
[58:09] said ye have i loved you saith the lord
[58:12] and they said lord
[58:14] he said you say when if you loved us
[58:17] and he said i want you to look at your
[58:18] brother and
[58:19] their inheritance
[58:21] and look at how i blessed you
[58:23] come on where i brought you from
[58:26] come on
[58:28] i chastise you because i love you
[58:32] he told them when they come into the
[58:34] land he says i want you to be aware that
[58:36] you don't do like those people did
[58:39] you don't search out to their gods he
[58:41] says because i uprooted them for those
[58:44] things and if you do those things i'll
[58:46] do you the same way
[58:47] didn't he say that
[58:49] come on so what it is we are blessed
[58:51] people we are covenant people we can't
[58:54] explain why god blesses us
[58:57] i'm just glad he did i don't know why he
[59:00] chose me
[59:02] but i'm glad he did and i'm going to be
[59:04] happy about it
[59:06] i'm going to shout about it i'm going to
[59:08] tell somebody about it hallelujah
[59:10] oh god
[59:12] hallelujah
[59:14] come on
[59:16] he said restore unto me come on the joy
[59:20] he wanted his joy back didn't he
[59:23] come on so one thing about it
[59:25] david could look back
[59:28] at where he was
[59:29] and i believe that you know nathan
[59:32] came to him
[59:34] once
[59:35] and began to tell him
[59:36] the little story about the man that had
[59:38] the lamb
[59:39] and the other ones that had all these
[59:40] other ones and
[59:41] but he was so greedy wasn't he
[59:44] he took that mother man's lamb and had
[59:46] him slaughtered it grieved david's heart
[59:49] to hear about somebody that could do
[59:51] something like that
[59:52] but he didn't know
[59:54] that he was the man
[59:56] come on
[59:57] and i said sometimes it grieves your
[59:59] heart
[1:00:00] darn it
[1:00:02] when you look at how judah sow jesus for
[1:00:05] 30 pieces of silver
[1:00:08] but look at your life sometimes
[1:00:11] are you the man
[1:00:14] judah sold them for 30 pieces what did
[1:00:16] you sell them for
[1:00:18] come on what did you give it up for
[1:00:22] come on
[1:00:25] what did you miss out for a moment
[1:00:29] not that it was over with and he
[1:00:31] realized what he lost out on what he do
[1:00:34] when he hung himself didn't he come on
[1:00:37] i said when you look at the story come
[1:00:39] on don't let don't let nathan say thou
[1:00:41] art the man come on
[1:00:44] come on
[1:00:46] glory to god
[1:00:47] i said what it is
[1:00:49] we find that you know but i like how he
[1:00:51] began to tell him you know that you know
[1:00:53] you were blessed of god
[1:00:56] god would have gave you whatever you
[1:00:57] wanted all you had to do was ask for it
[1:01:00] don't you know we had a place tonight we
[1:01:03] know he'll supply all our needs
[1:01:04] according to his riches in glory but i
[1:01:06] believe god loves you tonight come on
[1:01:08] that you are the blessed of god that he
[1:01:10] ain't gonna leave you without sometimes
[1:01:13] he don't give you stuff because he know
[1:01:15] it will destroy you
[1:01:17] you might not understand it but in the
[1:01:19] bible when the morning comes you'll know
[1:01:22] that what god did in your life he did it
[1:01:25] for you good
[1:01:26] a lot of things i wanted in life felt
[1:01:28] like i missed that on but when i look
[1:01:30] back
[1:01:32] see where god has brought me from see
[1:01:35] where he's placed me at now i said i
[1:01:37] didn't miss out on nothing i'm still in
[1:01:39] god's holy plan hallelujah
[1:01:42] oh jesus
[1:01:43] i'm still in the will of god and that's
[1:01:45] where i want to be i don't know about
[1:01:47] you but that's where i want to be at
[1:01:49] oh jesus is that where you want to be at
[1:01:51] tonight
[1:01:52] hallelujah
[1:01:54] he got all goals and all these things
[1:01:56] which are fine
[1:01:58] but god i want to be in your holy plan
[1:02:01] let my footsteps be ordered by you lord
[1:02:04] because this life it ain't it's just
[1:02:06] here here today and gone tomorrow
[1:02:09] come on
[1:02:10] every week you're hearing about somebody
[1:02:11] passing away ain't you
[1:02:13] come on the young and the old
[1:02:16] when god called your name
[1:02:18] come on will you be ready
[1:02:20] that's all that matters
[1:02:22] i guess it's been staying here lately we
[1:02:24] living this life so we can live again
[1:02:26] that's what i'm living it for come on is
[1:02:29] that what you live in it for tonight
[1:02:31] but we find that like you said david
[1:02:34] david
[1:02:35] reckoned with where he lost his joy at
[1:02:38] come on
[1:02:40] it was by sin
[1:02:42] had come in
[1:02:43] but not only did he recognize where he
[1:02:46] lost it
[1:02:47] come on
[1:02:48] but he began to repent didn't he and
[1:02:51] asked god
[1:02:53] one of the things
[1:02:54] he knew that was important
[1:02:56] was the heart
[1:02:59] david knew how important the heart was
[1:03:03] come on
[1:03:04] sometimes
[1:03:05] we forget that how important the heart
[1:03:07] is
[1:03:08] you can give god your strength like
[1:03:11] samson and all those
[1:03:13] but if your heart ain't in it come on
[1:03:16] you can give god your voice
[1:03:18] all these things but where's your heart
[1:03:21] come on i believe the bible just
[1:03:23] paraphrasing say the heart you know
[1:03:24] deceitful and wicked no man could know
[1:03:26] it come on
[1:03:28] it's a lot of stuff in your heart that
[1:03:30] you don't know is there but god knows
[1:03:32] there
[1:03:33] i always say you know god knows us
[1:03:35] better than we know ourselves
[1:03:38] he knows what we're capable of because
[1:03:40] he knows what's down in there
[1:03:42] come on
[1:03:43] so david saw the importance of the heart
[1:03:48] so he began to say lord creating me
[1:03:51] come on
[1:03:52] i don't want to repair the old give me
[1:03:54] something new god
[1:03:56] create creating me
[1:03:58] a clean heart come on
[1:04:00] do something in my spirit again
[1:04:04] and that's what we need even here
[1:04:05] tonight
[1:04:07] god to do something in your spirit
[1:04:10] just seeing it from the intellectual and
[1:04:12] the natural they ain't doing no good
[1:04:16] but what's up get in your spirit
[1:04:19] and begin to begin to working in that
[1:04:21] come on
[1:04:24] then things will begin to change
[1:04:26] then we'll begin to see the importance
[1:04:28] of it that we ain't wrestling against
[1:04:30] flesh and blood
[1:04:33] but we're fighting demon powers
[1:04:36] come on
[1:04:37] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:04:41] ready to destroy your soul
[1:04:43] if it ain't for the grace of god
[1:04:46] we ain't fighting natural battles
[1:04:48] it's demons out there
[1:04:52] ready to destroy you
[1:04:54] ready to destroy your home
[1:04:57] ready to take your children
[1:04:59] demons devils
[1:05:01] we need the grace of god tonight
[1:05:04] come on i'll just cut off right there
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:08] [Applause]
[1:05:16] praise the lord amen
[1:05:18] we thank god amen
[1:05:21] restoring me amen
[1:05:23] restore me o lord amen
[1:05:26] it's a time of restoration i believe
[1:05:28] that
[1:05:29] me and my wife was talking about revival
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:33] they got up three o'clock the other
[1:05:34] morning and you know just started
[1:05:36] writing
[1:05:37] as the spirit of the lord i i said
[1:05:40] that's what we need amen
[1:05:42] and um
[1:05:44] i i i was listening to our brother
[1:05:46] ernest and
[1:05:48] caleb and i was up in louisville the
[1:05:51] other month and
[1:05:53] how um
[1:05:55] the pastor's son and different ones just
[1:05:58] said the youth had never experienced
[1:06:01] what we experienced in
[1:06:02] what we experience in a sense they need
[1:06:06] to experience the holy ghost like like
[1:06:09] we
[1:06:10] we experienced when we were coming up
[1:06:12] and we want that presence back
[1:06:15] praise god
[1:06:16] and i just say he's here
[1:06:20] praise god
[1:06:21] the same god is here right now
[1:06:24] praise god it's just that we got to
[1:06:26] enter into that presence
[1:06:29] amen god never left
[1:06:31] praise god is he he's the same god right
[1:06:34] now
[1:06:35] but we got to enter into that presence
[1:06:38] amen we got to know that that's what i
[1:06:40] want
[1:06:41] amen i i know what i need amen and god i
[1:06:44] want it amen

[1:06:49] power of god i need it god
[1:06:51] praise god
[1:06:53] hallelujah
[1:06:54] and i just believe it takes humility
[1:06:56] just being humble
[1:06:58] humble enough to acknowledge our
[1:07:00] transgressions since the lord and to me
[1:07:03] it just said the song says it's me it's
[1:07:06] me oh lord standing in the need of
[1:07:07] prayer
[1:07:09] god i need you
[1:07:11] i need a move of god in my life it's an
[1:07:14] individual affair it's not a group thing

[1:07:19] lord out of a pure heart to god i need
[1:07:22] you

[1:07:42] individual
[1:07:45] we got to let go and let god have his
[1:07:48] way
[1:07:49] in our lives as individuals we can't sit
[1:07:51] back and ask god to move amen but you
[1:07:55] want god to move in somebody else that's
[1:07:57] going to inspire us to do something but
[1:07:59] we got to say god amen i'm not worried
[1:08:01] about the outside world it's me lord
