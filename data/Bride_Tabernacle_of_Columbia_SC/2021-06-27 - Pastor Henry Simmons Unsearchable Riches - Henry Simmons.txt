you gentiles have you heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you lord how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote before in few words whereby when you read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages were was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow ears and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me whom least than is less than the least of all saints is disgrace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and god bless you reading towards you may be seated today we want to talk on on authority unsearchable riches amen unsearchable riches god is a rich so rich that he calls an unsearchable praise god how can i buy how can we by search and find our god amen god weighs a past fighting out but thank god that paul says it came a period of time that god had hid certain things from amen the children the sons of god but it was at a time period that god was going to release what he heard so by the grace of god as we know that in this age christ is the mystery of god revealed amen and god has unveiled himself today oh god the mighty god has been a veil before us and we have seen amen that god locking was in the uh dispensation of time and when god dealt with the jews under the dispensation of the law they met god was dealing amen and bringing amen a new revelation amen and he was uh revealing unto them that grace of god has appeared amen so what was locked up under the law amen ready to be revealed at the last time god locked it up and shielded up and nobody knew amen praise god this grace that god was getting ready to release among the people so the pharisees and the sadducees and the jews which were god chosen people amen did not have the revelation that god was getting ready to reveal what paul said he made it known unto us amen the apostles and prophets amen that we might give it to you and i want to say uh the riches the unsearchable riches are available this morning god had made certain things available that was not available beforehand amen so god in this last day amen has made available to you and are the things that he told daniel to seal it in the book until the time of the end [Music] amen but now at the time of the end god will release and make those things that was sealed up available to you and now so by the grace of god as god had hidden things in christ amen and he wanted to make them known god has a way of making things known amen and god always uses a man amen to make things known that he wants to reveal to the people amen but god chooses vessels amen in order to reveal his revelation praise god he could have just said well i'ma reveal it to everybody but god amen revealed it to paul said to us the prophets and the apostles amen he said but i i i want you to know that god had a special anointing on my life i was uh uh i was less than the least of the apostles the uh of all men i i i you know i don't i don't even have uh amen praise god uh any business amen amen that god will give this gift that god will restore upon me these revelations that i'm praise god and use me in this way i'm not worthy of it because i'm the less in the least of all are you with me so paul was showing the humility you know that's what god does when we see ourselves as insufficient amen that we're not able amen and sometimes we see ourselves as oddballs as and nobody's but god wants to do something with those that look down on those that despise and reject it god want to use oh yes he does oh god when you look like you the least of all amen then god amen wants to elevate you again amen god when we think with something when we're nothing and that's when god amen hallelujah our pride are getting our way god cannot release revelation revelating knowledge to you until you humble yourself till you recognize your condition i recognize how weak i am but when i'm weak he's strong thank god i'm not worthy but he meant of the abundance of revelation that he's bestowed upon me but by is a a gift that god has given me amen i i i he's a he's leaded to my charge he's giving me a choice to keep amen and then these revelations that amen he could have chosen anybody else but god has chosen me that's the least nonetheless the least of them all praise god i you know i persecuted the church amen i was against the the truth of the gospel i was against jesus amen i and now amen god chooses somebody that amen that was against him and despised this way the way you call heresy oh yes i i thought it was i thought it was heresy amen i thought that people going to worship another god this one called jesus who is he praise god we have abraham eyes and then jacob and we have the moses and all of them but after jesus we don't know him but amen he does some things that amen that we don't understand but i want you to know amen he or elder the lord our god is one lord and this man called jesus ain't he being a man but he's making himself god and he telling us that god was his father and they they didn't like that are you with me they met but it was uh things that were hidden in jesus amen amen the mystery of god was hidden in christ are you with me that was things that jesus had inside of him that he was going to release among the people and cause the word of god to become alive amen but it was a it was held back unto the time appointed of the father so god had a time and a season when jesus was going to step out of time out of eternity in the time are you with me so that's when amen the logos to god above us had become the god with us are you with me so god condescending amen coming down and amen the word being taken on flesh in the beginning what the word amen the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was a life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in the darkness are you with me brother sister the light shines in the darkness but the darkness comprehended it not remember but somebody there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came the bear witness of the lord he said i'm not the light but i came to bear witness are you with me oh yes amen god had sent someone to prepare the way praise god as god worked back then to the jews he sent somebody to prepare the way amen of the lord and god in this this recession of time amen god will send somebody to prepare the way amen that the bride might be ready for the bridegroom that would be a midnight cry behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him i said it should be a cry in the end time of midnight cry a voice of one crying amen come out of her my people as revelation 18 says why not come out oh what are we coming out of babylon the great is falling it's falling they've become the habitation of devils and the cage of every unclean and hateful boy i want you to know god call you out praise god i'm telling you it's a revelation it's a mystery in this age that god amen had christ they meant to come out from god amen and revealed himself to the people so god in this last age had the mystery of amen the bride that was here in christ amen as christ was heared in god amen then amen the bride of jesus christ was hid in god his wife amen adam's wife was hid in adam but it came a time when adam was put to sleep he meant that god was able to release amen and adam said she's born on my bone amen flesh of my flesh why do my word spirit of my spirit amen praise god he she knew he knew amen that she came from him amen and god knows that amen the bride came from him amen she is him in bright form hallelujah praise god you are jesus christ in bright form amen to you amen he said i don't call you no more church because god come to get a bride out of the church are you what man because the church amen goes to the tribulation but the bride is called out for the rapture are you a man are you whooping five wise and five foolish are you up man but you wise here's the mind that has understanding let him that has understanding he that has the wisdom let him count the number of the beast i'm so glad that god had to reveal to us the unsearchable riches in christ let me just let me just uh look at it for a minute here the under what's made available is the impossible is made possible yes amen so for you what what you guys believe us oh amen the impossible is made possible amen because you amen nothing shall be impossible for you and i praise god nothing is too hard for god are you with me so all that looks impossible god is saying i want to

riches the unsearchable riches of christ amen if you don't know who you are you can't take advantage of the things that god has made available for you but once you understand who you are then you know what's made available to you later god has made things available to you amen and it's unsatiable what god has made available well that's no good it's good to be a christian it's good to be saved because god has bestowed upon us unsearchable riches hallelujah hallelujah amen i don't worry about the billionaires of this world because they don't know what this is all about yeah lord hallelujah money came by oh dig down in the air and find all fine diamonds find what you want but this is untouchable you can't see you can sense the ocean you can saturn amen but you can't find this because it's unsearchable praise god only through god only through christ is just made available oh god i thank god that it just amen this that god has unveiled to you and i the mighty god has been unveiled and he's he's given us a revelation that what adam lost i'm restoring amen praise god i'm giving it back to you everything that adam lost i'm i'm restoring and i'm giving it back to you praise god if adam had spoken word i'm giving you spoken word are you with me if you can say to the mountain be thou removed oh yes you can say it amen because god has made it available and possible for you to

god has a messenger that he sent before us in this last day also are you up man praise god and god has a messenger and the messenger has a message praise god what it is amen the message of john was to get a bride ready for the bridegroom amen but in the midnight cry the message of amen might account for is to get a bride ready for the rapture are you what man oh yes you may not want to get ready but somebody would hear the voice then somebody said jesus said why you didn't believe john praise god oh yes they said that there was no greater more among the prophets that was born in him than john

be against the word are you what greater is he than he that is in the world praise god that's what's made available the greater is in you that's what he says in uh ephesians two i mean three and ten i just read the ninth verse okay he said to make all men to what see paul had a mission and a purpose and the purpose of his ministry was to make what see jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see he cannot understand the kingdom of god are you with me nicodemus said how can a man be born when he's old can he enter a second time into his mother's wound and be born but jesus answered very very loud sin is he except for man is born of what water and spirit he cannot what enter the what amen if you want to get in you got you got to come god provided way for this day amen god has never provided a way for this day not for another day but for this day are you with me and god provided way for this day you must recognize that amen christ is made available for the hour that you live in praise god amen peter stood up on the day of pentecost and he said these men are not drunk and you suppose say this but the third hour day he said what this is this is that was spoken of by the prophet joel that in the last days said god i poured my spirit upon those that believe receive come on somebody those that believe receive praise god of your believer you'll receive the outpouring of the holy ghost hey god you can have it amen it's available they're unsearchable riches amen it's available to you all you've got to do is believe in receipt praise god what happened to amen we think we believe and we don't get nothing all right amen we we walk away with our heads down all depressed and all oppressed and all been out of proportion because they meant somebody did this somebody did that amen i've been taking advantage of things ain't going right amen but who are you you've been restored god has restored you back in the head and not the tail god has given you headship god has given you dominion are you with me that's why he he's giving you dominion over the fish of the sea the birds of the and every creeping thing i'll give you dominion oh you want me praise god sin shall not have dominion over you amen praise god greater is he that's what then he that is in the world praise god all that is in the world is the lust of the what amen the lust of that and what praise god all that's in the world isn't that right but you are in in christ and your life is here in christ in god are you what praise god the devil can't get in there not unless you let it amen praise god i'm so glad that god it's so good i love him do you love him he's good to you and i amen he was good oh amen he's done so much for us only and we'll take advantage of his availability the things that he made possible you know i thought about he giving us peace you know what's available to you and i it's a peace amen hallelujah oh that compasses all knowledge and understanding you know if money could buy this kind of peace amen the billionaire will give up everything he got to get this peace amen but he's the prince of peace you got to come by him you got to receive the prince he said my peace i give you not of the world give are you god gives you a peace that compasses all knowledge and understanding and you know what in this world we shall need some peace isn't that right there's so much going on everywhere we need peace but god gives us peace like a river are you with me my peace i give you the prince of peace is the one that is made available to you and i the only thing we have to do is say lord i receive i want that peace god only you can give it it's untouchable i can't get it praise god sometimes the devil make it so complicated and so hard amen he makes it so complicated and it's so difficult amen it's like something you've got to struggle to get something you can all you gotta do is believe and receive amen amen god's peace is available to you all you gotta do is believe and receive now he says to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been what it's been heard why do god hide things [Music] amen because that's the way he if he's god can't he do what he want praise god he hid it amen and god who created all things by jesus christ so you want to wear everything made where it come from jesus christ made it are you up here somebody said i thought god made it well if you look he said when you see me you see my father i am a father oh are you with me so i want you to know that god created all things by the word of its power that the things were seen was not made by the things that do which do appear when we know but about the word of god praise god oh god ain't god good how much do you what do you want it's available whatever you need god has made it available to you all you got to do is want it and receive it and know that you can have it you don't have to struggle to get it you don't have to beg to get it all you got to do is receive it's freely given to you amen god is already oh let me just read on i got this to the intent the tempers to the attempt that now until principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made might be known by the what i you know under that law doctor should not you can't do this you can't do that you can't under the law but you see that's what i say if we only know what's available for us people the reason why people don't serve god because they they're still looking at the law well if have i come to jesus i can't smoke my joint i can't sniff my coke i can't take my shadow my little taste a whiskey every night then if i come to god look what i have to give up look what you're getting so you we're so busy looking at what we have to give up when we're not looking at what you're receiving are you with me if you only know what you you you're getting amen praise god you you'll be glad to give up come on now praise god if i ask you to give me a dollar and i'll give you uh 10 million i said give me a dollar and i'll give you 10 million folks you know of truth y'all know how it is if you give me a dollar i'll give you a million uh you know what folks who do they'll walk right past you you think i'm crazy i ain't giving my dollar you think they're going to give me a million dollars if i give them a dollar [Music] most people is it's uh it's unthinkable unbelievable i can't believe that if i give a dollar they're going to give me a million so they'll walk away they'll walk away you think i'm stupid i think i'm crazy jesus said if you give me your life i'll give you eternal life [Music] eternal life it don't don't make sense because i'm having too much fun now i'm enjoying what i got so i don't want to give it up now even though they're enjoying what they got you know what job said a man that is born of a woman is what and what now they know they got full of trouble it come with it don't tell anything so good cause if you've been living a little while you got some amen because that's what comes with the life itself a man that is born of a woman in a few days and full of trouble so trouble coming with life that's a part of living but jesus said let not your heart be true amen are you up man so god has amen a way of making your trouble your little lighter amen because you're not looking at things that are seen you're looking at things that are what oh yes you're looking into the unseen god got something far better than what you're going through right now so what i'm going through right now i i thank god that i can go through this because of the way i'm getting to my journey where i'm going ain't that praise god i got to go through this to get to that praise god i want to get down because what i go through here it may go to oh it's going to be worth it when i get there amen amen praise god but i'm already there now praise god i'm not going to get there i'm there now come on praise god as a man thinketh in his heart so it's he praise god the devil might be casting all kind of thoughts of stones and doing everything it can do to the woman amen but jesus said oh yes he without seeing cast over a stone amen they held back isn't that right but thank god the devil want to stone you and want to kill you but god in that grace is sufficient god is so messy he loves you praise god this woman done god said i ain't worried about that i see everything this woman amen want me in spite of her wretched life she wants god hallelujah i i got something for this one oh woman go and sin no more amen i i isn't that good god looks beyond your fault and he sees your needs amen hallelujah the unsuchable riches amen god is not a man he don't see like man see oh you won't be but god sees amen the heart that's right are you what man we give up but god never amen gives up on you as long as the blood running warm in your man it says might be made known unto the church the manifold wisdom of god the 11th verse according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord god had a purpose amen and you being here this morning amen he's got a purpose for your life and it's an eternal purpose god got that purpose amen it's a reason for everything that you ever go through it's a reason you been through that and god said i'll take your bad and i'll make it good because i'll work everything together to the good to them to love the lord amen the devil meant it for evil god god meant it for good are you with me because i needed to go through this to get to where god wanted to take me praise god we got some things we go through but it's gonna get us where god wants us to be just think he's got it all are you he's got it all under control so he says it's eternal purpose

and sister it ought to not be something you have to think about it ought to not be something that you just say i can do that because many people can talk to talk but they can't walk the walk are you with me praise god but god wants to amen to you to understand what's available the unsearchable riches the love of god that compasses all knowledge let me let me see he says you'll be rooted and grounded in love see because people are not rooted and grounded in love amen that's why you see people are ready to fight just push them the wrong way they go back depending on the arm of us flesh but the weapon of our warfare are not what connor god is made available to us they met the tools that within god in god god is what love isn't that right and god is released to you and i amen made

your children are the most high god amen and god has oh boy thank uh you you we're serving uh uh uh oh god that's unsearchable and god wants to say i i want you to know the availability what's available for you amen this kind of love now i'm i'm closing but let me go and try to finish this maybe the 18th verse may be able to comprehend with all the sinks the breath the lymph the depth and the height and the know the what the 19th verse and the know the what the love of christ which passes what knowledge see god love is unsearchable it passed all knowledge so you can't find out it's love praise god so god loves you in such a way that praise god nobody can love you like god love you amen people want love but the love that they are looking for is only through the baptism of the holy ghost it's only when christ can get in your heart and only when when christ get deep enough down inside you see because it's some depths of the love of god so sometimes we love i mean we feel a little of the love of god but the depths of the love of god that's what keeps you that's when you're rooted and that's when you're grounded amen but when you just you know i love the lord i love the lord i know he loved me amen not just you know on surface love but you got to go a little deeper down to it passes your your flesh and passes your spirit your you know and goes down into the soul amen and it finds root there it's got to be settled and established there the love of god got to oh rooted and grounded amen and god let god love settle down inside praise god then it begin to bring up and bring forth the fruits and the manifestation of the spirit of god because the tree has found roots amen so by the grace of god okay he says the 21st now to him that is is able to do what exceeding it

god has given you until you do that then it's just left on the shelf all these blessings that you should be taking advantage of it's just left out there because nobody's taking advantage of it instead of taking advantage of the blessings of god people are are talking about what the devil done what the devil going to do what the devil might do instead of what god has made available in heavenly places in christ all of these blessings have been made available to you so why don't you just start reaping all the benefits of being a christian amen because those benefits are for you praise god
