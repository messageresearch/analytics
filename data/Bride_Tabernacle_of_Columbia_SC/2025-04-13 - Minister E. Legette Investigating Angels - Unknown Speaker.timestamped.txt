[38:57] Amen. Amen. Are you looking for them?
[39:01] Amen. Genesis 18 and we'll begin here at
[39:06] the first verse. If you got it, say
[39:08] amen. Amen. And it reads, "And the Lord
[39:11] appeared unto him in the plains of
[39:14] memory memory. And he sat in the tent
[39:18] door in the heat of the day. And he
[39:22] lifted up his eyes, and behold, and lo,
[39:24] three men stood by him. And when he saw
[39:26] them, he ran to meet them from the tent
[39:29] door, and bowed himself toward the
[39:31] ground, and said, "My Lord, if now I
[39:34] have found favor in thy sight, pass not
[39:36] away, I pray, thee, from thy servant.
[39:38] Let a little water, I pray, you be
[39:41] fetched, and wash your feet, and rest
[39:43] yourselves under the tree. And I will
[39:46] fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye
[39:48] your hearts. After that ye shall pass
[39:51] on, for
[39:53] therefore therefore are ye come to your
[39:56] servant. And they said, so do as thou
[40:00] hast said. And Abraham hasted and into
[40:03] the
[40:04] tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
[40:07] quick quickly three measures of fine
[40:10] meal needed, and make cakes upon the
[40:13] earth. And Abraham ran ran unto the Lord
[40:16] and into and to the herd and fetched a
[40:19] calf tender and good and gave it into a
[40:22] young man and he hasted to dress it. He
[40:24] took butter and milk and calf and
[40:26] dressed it and set before him. And he
[40:28] stood by them under the tree and they
[40:31] did eat. And they said unto him, where
[40:35] is Sarah thy wife? And he said, "Behold,
[40:38] in the tent," and he said, "I will
[40:40] certainly return unto thee according to
[40:43] the time of life. And lo, Sarah, thy
[40:47] wife shall have a son." And Sarah heard
[40:49] it in the tent door which was behind
[40:52] them. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[40:54] well stricken in age, and it ceased to
[40:57] be with Sarah after the manner of women.
[41:00] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[41:02] saying, "After I am wax, old shall I
[41:05] have pleasure. My Lord being old also."
[41:08] You may be seated. I'm going to read
[41:09] down a little further. She laughed.
[41:11] Amen. Come on. God given her a word and
[41:15] she laughed. That's something, ain't
[41:19] it? Here in the 14th verse says, is
[41:22] there in the 13th verse? And the Lord
[41:25] said unto Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah
[41:27] laugh, saying, Surely I of assurity
[41:33] sure, saying, Shall I of assurity bear a
[41:36] child which am old?" Is there anything
[41:39] too hard for the Lord? At the appointed
[41:42] time, I will return unto thee according
[41:45] to the time of life, and Sarah shall
[41:47] have a son." Then Sarah denied, saying,
[41:50] I laugh not, for she was afraid. And he
[41:53] said, "Nay, but thou did laugh." And a
[41:55] men arose from then, and took towards
[41:57] Sodom, and Abraham went with them to
[42:00] bring them on the way. And the Lord
[42:03] said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that
[42:06] thing which I do, seeing that Abraham
[42:09] shall surely become a great and a mighty
[42:12] nation, and all the nations of the earth
[42:15] shall be blessed in him. For I know him
[42:18] that he will command his children and
[42:20] his household after him that and they
[42:23] shall keep the way of the Lord to do
[42:25] justice and judgment that the Lord may
[42:28] bring upon Abraham that which he has
[42:30] spoken. And the Lord said, "Because the
[42:33] cry of Sodom and Gomorra is great, and
[42:37] because their sin is very grievous, I
[42:40] will go down now and see whether they
[42:42] have done allto together according to
[42:45] the cry of it which is come unto me, and
[42:48] if not, I will know." And the men turned
[42:51] their faces from then, and went toward
[42:54] Sodom. But Abram stood yet before the
[42:57] Lord. May God have a blessed reading of
[43:00] his word this morning. This morning,
[43:02] just for a moment, I want to talk about
[43:04] investigating angels. Amen.
[43:07] Investigating angels. Now, we know that,
[43:10] you know, uh we all know that we're
[43:12] living in the end time. Amen. That's one
[43:15] thing that we can't deny that we're
[43:17] living in the end time. Even in living
[43:20] in the time of of of you know, wars,
[43:24] rumors of wars, pestilence, right? Come
[43:27] on. droughts, famines, right? One
[43:30] turning against the other. That's the
[43:33] hour that we live in. Can't trust
[43:34] nobody, can you? That's right. But you
[43:38] know, so sometimes you you wonder with
[43:42] the world and the wickedness that is in,
[43:44] you wonder sometime how much more wicked
[43:48] can the world get, right? That scripture
[43:51] came to my mind that you know that you
[43:54] know during the end it says the love of
[43:56] many was going to wax cold. Right? You
[43:58] know, you look in the amplified version,
[44:00] it's talk talking about because of
[44:02] lawlessness, right? And people would be
[44:06] living in a world to where is no law
[44:09] really apply to them, right? So, you do
[44:12] what you want to do when you want to do
[44:13] and everything going to be all right,
[44:15] right? Or you make your own rules and
[44:18] you you live by them. And and sometimes
[44:21] people do that and they think God just
[44:23] going to have to take whatever they give
[44:24] them, right? I've heard people say that
[44:27] before that this is the way I am and and
[44:30] this is the way God made me. So, he just
[44:32] got to take it this way. Right? But
[44:35] that's a great deception, right? One
[44:38] thing about it, we didn't make
[44:40] ourselves. Come on. God created man,
[44:43] didn't he? Come on. And he didn't create
[44:46] us to just do what we want when we want.
[44:48] Hallelujah. Amen. But God created us for
[44:51] one thing, and that is to serve him.
[44:53] Hallelujah. Amen. And to give him
[44:55] praise. That's why you give your hands
[44:57] for, right? We do everything with our
[44:59] hands except for what God graded them
[45:01] for, right? Hallelujah.
[45:04] He give us those hands to clap and raise
[45:07] them and worship him. But you know,
[45:08] people are shamed to do that, ain't
[45:09] they? Hallelujah. People ashamed to
[45:12] raise their hands and say, "Lord, thank
[45:14] you." Come on. Thank you for giving me
[45:16] another day. Thank you for giving me
[45:18] breath to breathe. Thank you, Lord, for
[45:20] all your goodness and your mercy.
[45:22] people, they shamed to do that, ain't
[45:24] they? Come on. But what if God took them
[45:27] hands away? Hallelujah. Come on. But I
[45:30] want to say this morning, you know, one
[45:31] thing about it, you know, he said, if
[45:33] you be shamed of him, he'll be ashamed
[45:35] of you. You deny him, he'll deny you.
[45:37] One thing about it on that day, I want
[45:40] God to be able Jesus to look and say,
[45:42] "He didn't deny me." Hallelujah. He
[45:44] wasn't ashamed of me or she wasn't
[45:46] ashamed of me, but so I'm not going to
[45:49] be ashamed of them right now. Come on.
[45:51] Come on. That's one person that you
[45:53] don't want to deny you. Come on. Mother
[45:56] deny you. Father deny you. Friends. Come
[45:58] on. But you don't want God to deny you.
[46:01] I want God to say, just like how he told
[46:03] Abraham, I know Abraham. Hallelujah. And
[46:06] I know what he going to do. I know
[46:08] what's in his heart. He going to command
[46:10] his children to walk in my ways.
[46:11] Hallelujah. So I can tell him my
[46:14] secrets. Hallelujah. I can tell him
[46:16] what's coming up ahead because I know
[46:18] what's in his heart. And I'm so glad
[46:20] today. See the thing about it is you
[46:23] know I look at my life many times and I
[46:25] says that you know there were many
[46:28] sometimes you look at that were more
[46:30] worthy than you that God could have
[46:32] raised up God could have blessed and did
[46:34] all these other things but I'm so glad
[46:37] that God knew me better than I knew
[46:39] myself. Hallelujah. He knew that in my
[46:42] heart. Hallelujah. If he give me an
[46:44] opportunity that I'll do right. He knew
[46:47] in my heart that if I got the
[46:49] opportunity, I'd serve him with all that
[46:51] I got. Now, I'm glad because I didn't
[46:53] put that there. God put that there.
[46:55] Hallelujah. Ain't you glad that God
[46:57] thought about you this morning? Come on.
[47:00] Somebody, oh, can't do this and don't
[47:02] wish I could do that. Come on. But you
[47:04] ought to be glad that God kept you in
[47:06] the number. Hallelujah. You ought to be
[47:08] glad that God saved you from a life of
[47:10] miserleness, right? Come on. There's
[47:13] many things, many places. If God
[47:15] wouldn't have kept you and let you slip.
[47:17] Come on. But the mercy of God, that's
[47:19] the age. You know, we living in the age
[47:21] of grace right now. Come on. When the
[47:25] capstone was coming, what? It was a
[47:26] shout of grace, wasn't it? Come on. In
[47:29] the world that we live in, even the
[47:31] world himself know that it's the grace
[47:33] of God keeping us every day. Amen. Come
[47:36] on. Y'all believe that? I was thinking
[47:38] about how wicked the hour is that we
[47:41] live in. I was looking at yesterday the
[47:44] the sheriff talk about the the video
[47:46] showing a video of the shooting they had
[47:48] in the mall the other day. I mean, you
[47:51] know, young people now walking in the
[47:54] mall. Two of them just had handguns, but
[47:56] one of them had a rifle.
[47:58] Now, you can't go to the store without
[48:00] carrying your rifle. What kind of world
[48:02] we living in? And they had a shootout in
[48:05] the middle of the mall.
[48:07] And they had the little the lady with
[48:09] the girl walking with the baby in the
[48:12] stroller. And it started she was caught
[48:15] right in the middle of it. And they
[48:17] showed a video of her laying down
[48:19] covering her baby. What the sheriff was
[48:21] saying, he said it was the grace of God.
[48:23] Neither one of them got hit. I began to
[48:26] think about that that even the everybody
[48:28] know it's the grace of God. Hallelujah.
[48:31] Right. Come on. Because things are
[48:33] happening. They're happening so fast.
[48:35] They're happening all the time. It's
[48:37] God's grace, ain't it? Come on. I was
[48:40] thinking about that great earthquake
[48:42] over at uh forget where it was at over
[48:44] there sees not long ago, Thailand or
[48:47] somewhere, but 7.7 or something like
[48:50] that. Come on. People just going about
[48:53] their natural business, their natural
[48:55] things. All of a sudden, the earth
[48:56] starts shaking. That's right. Come on.
[48:58] And many people lost their life. Don't
[49:00] you know that every moment we living by
[49:02] the grace of God? Amen. Somebody showed
[49:04] me a video a whole bunch of people in a
[49:06] club somewhere in the in down south in
[49:10] the in the uh Pacific or somewhere like
[49:12] that. Anyway, the roof fell in, killed
[49:14] over 900 something people. Come on. But
[49:18] what it is, that's the thing. You know,
[49:20] the world is going on doing their thing,
[49:22] right? Not knowing that your days are
[49:25] numbered. Not knowing that one day God
[49:27] going to get tired.
[49:30] Come on. Amen. Somebody say amen this
[49:32] morning. Amen. God going to get tired
[49:34] one day, ain't he? But I just pray that
[49:36] I'm on the right side. Hallelujah.
[49:38] That's why every day we wake up and we
[49:40] pray and say, "Lord, keep my mind."
[49:42] Hallelujah. Keep my feet. Guide my
[49:45] footsteps. Lord, let the the words from
[49:47] my mouth and the meditation of my heart.
[49:50] Come on. That's what it's about. Let it
[49:52] be acceptable in whose sight? God's
[49:55] sight. Right. Come on. Everybody want to
[49:58] be Everybody want men and all that to
[50:00] prove, but come on. You got to be
[50:02] acceptable in whose sight? God's sight.
[50:04] Amen. Come on. Man will be on your side
[50:07] today and turn on you tomorrow. Amen.
[50:09] Yes, they will. Amen. Family will be on
[50:12] your side today and turn on you
[50:13] tomorrow. Amen. But one thing about it,
[50:15] when God choose you, he don't turn on
[50:18] you. Hallelujah. God know who you are.
[50:20] He chose you from the beginning and he
[50:23] didn't make no mistake about it. I
[50:25] believe that. Amen. Oh, and I'm
[50:27] thankful. Hallelujah. Come on. But we
[50:30] living in a a wicked hour, ain't we?
[50:32] Come on. And in the hour that we're
[50:34] living in. Come on. We know that Sodom
[50:37] and Gomorrah is back. Come on. How many
[50:39] believe that today? Come on. There's no
[50:42] denying it, right? Come on. We living in
[50:45] that hour, ain't we? It's as it was in
[50:48] the days of Lot. It'll be the same way
[50:49] today. Ain't it? Come on. And we can see
[50:52] the signs of the times. Hallelujah. Come
[50:54] on. And y'all and your heart should be
[50:56] saying, "Come, Lord Jesus, come."
[50:58] Hallelujah.
[51:00] But you know in that hour, hallelujah,
[51:04] we're talking about investigating
[51:05] angels. In that hour, angels were in the
[51:08] earth, wasn't they? Come on. Angels were
[51:11] in the earth. Amen. You know, the
[51:13] scriptures in Hebrews uh 13 talked about
[51:16] the the the the beware that you who you
[51:18] entertain because you angels, right?
[51:21] Amen. You think they're just strangers,
[51:23] but angels are among us. Hallelujah. But
[51:26] many of times people ain't spiritual
[51:28] enough to know that angels are among
[51:30] you, right? Come on. What the these
[51:34] angels come to do, hallelujah. Not only
[51:36] do they come to investigate and see if
[51:39] the time is right, hallelujah, for God's
[51:43] judgment, but they also got another
[51:45] purpose. I believe that. And that is to
[51:48] encourage you and I that God ain't
[51:50] forgot about you. Hallelujah. to
[51:53] encourage you that the promises that God
[51:55] made you, come on, look like they ain't
[51:57] materialized yet, but in the appointed
[52:00] time, hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. I like how
[52:04] they told uh they told uh Abraham knows,
[52:07] it says, "We ain't forgot about Sarah.
[52:09] We ain't forgot about y'all."
[52:10] Hallelujah. Come on. He says, "But in
[52:13] the appointed time," Hallelujah. How
[52:15] many know that God's got an appointed
[52:17] time? See, that's what it is. We get
[52:19] impatient because we think God ain't
[52:21] moved yet. But I'm saying this morning,
[52:23] I believe that in all of my heart, God,
[52:26] when he makes you a promise, he's going
[52:28] to come through with that a promise. And
[52:31] he's got an appointed time that he's
[52:33] going to come through with it. Come on.
[52:35] It ain't in your timing, but it's in
[52:37] God's timing. Hallelujah. Come on. That
[52:40] ought to make you shout this morning.
[52:43] Come on. That ought to excite you. One
[52:45] thing about it, I look at it this way. I
[52:47] said, "God, you made the promise." Come
[52:50] on. Look like situation worse, but God,
[52:53] this is what your word said. And your
[52:56] word can't fail. Hallelujah. You're not
[52:58] a man that you should lie. Come on. But
[53:01] all of your promises are yay and not
[53:03] nay. Come on. Children getting worse,
[53:06] family getting worse, jobs going down.
[53:08] But God, you made us a promise.
[53:11] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. And I believe your
[53:15] promise. I'm holding on to your word,
[53:18] God. Oh, Jesus. Come on now. How many
[53:22] feel like holding on to God's word? Come
[53:24] on. Lord, they came to remind us.
[53:27] Hallelujah. Say at the appointed time.
[53:30] Come on. Yes, Lord. You've been holding
[53:31] out for so many years, but God ain't
[53:34] forgot about you. Hallelujah. Come on.
[53:36] You're still waiting, but God ain't
[53:38] forgot about you. Yes, Lord. Come on.
[53:40] Just just just keep holding on. I'm
[53:42] going to do what I said I'm going to do.
[53:44] Hallelujah. You just keep holding on
[53:47] now. Healing is on the way. Deliverance
[53:51] is on the way. You just keep holding on.
[53:54] Come on. I believe that. Hallelujah.
[53:58] I was thinking the other day, I said,
[53:59] God is still a healer now. It don't
[54:02] matter what, God is still a healer,
[54:05] ain't it? Amen. Come on. What happens?
[54:08] Your your faith. Hallelujah. The power
[54:11] of your faith brings the power of God on
[54:13] the scene. Amen. Amen. Come on. When
[54:15] your faith is at it in width, that's
[54:17] when the power of God take over.
[54:19] Hallelujah. I was thinking about uh Mo
[54:22] Moses mom mother and they had faith,
[54:25] didn't they? They took them and put them
[54:27] in that basket, but that's all they can
[54:29] do. But when their faith was at its end,
[54:32] then the power of God took over, didn't
[54:34] it? Hallelujah. Amen. Come on. Put them
[54:36] in there. They did all they did all they
[54:39] can do. Now it was up to God. Yes, Lord.
[54:41] And his power to take over from there.
[54:43] Hallelujah, Lord. And didn't he do what
[54:46] he promised? Didn't he keep that child?
[54:48] Hallelujah. Didn't he watch over that
[54:51] basket? Hallelujah.
[54:54] Oh, Jesus. Come on.
[54:57] When you done all you could do, watch
[54:58] the power of God then. Come on. That
[55:02] woman, all she had was a little bit. But
[55:04] what did Elijah tell her? You make me a
[55:06] cake first. Hallelujah. It took faith
[55:09] though, didn't it? Hallelujah. But when
[55:11] she gave out her last in faith, what
[55:14] happened? The power of God took over,
[55:16] didn't it? Come on. When you done all
[55:18] you can do, the power of God will take
[55:20] over. I'm a firm believer in that.
[55:23] Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. So many times and
[55:26] say, "God, I did all I can do." Yes,
[55:28] Lord. Come on. Well, you don't worry
[55:30] about it because now God's power getting
[55:32] ready to take over. Come on, God. I I
[55:35] done did all I can do. I'm trusting in
[55:37] you. It's in your hands, God. Yes.
[55:39] Hallelujah. It's in your hands from this
[55:42] point, Lord. I done did all I can do.
[55:44] It's in your hands now. God, I'm
[55:47] trusting in you now. Hallelujah. And
[55:50] watch G. We can't control God. All we
[55:52] can do is just believe him. Come on. And
[55:55] he'll do what he said. It look like it
[55:57] getting worse. So what? Hallelujah.
[56:00] Those Hebrew boys said if he don't do
[56:02] it, we still won't bow down because we
[56:05] believe he's still able. their faith
[56:08] when they turned loose. Hallelujah.
[56:10] They was even thrown in the fire, but
[56:12] the power of God took over, didn't it?
[56:15] Oh, I'm so I'm so glad this morning.
[56:18] Come on. I don't know about you, but I
[56:20] still believe in the power of God. Come
[56:22] on. Amen. So many times people look at
[56:25] situations and they look hopeless, so
[56:27] they just give up. Don't they? Come on.
[56:31] But I don't believe God wants us to give
[56:34] up. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Come on now.
[56:37] Amen. Even in death, like like the Paul
[56:40] says, "Oh, death, wears thy sting."
[56:42] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, grave where's thy
[56:44] victory. God don't want you to give up.
[56:46] Come on. But he wants you to continue to
[56:48] trusting in him. How many want to trust
[56:50] in him this morning? Come on. But we
[56:52] know that like we said in that time,
[56:55] hallelujah, the angels when they came,
[56:58] they came for some purposes right in
[57:00] that time. And I believe that we living
[57:01] in that time. See what the problem is
[57:03] today. We were saying last week, you
[57:06] know, as that people come to church,
[57:09] hallelujah, and they read the Bible, but
[57:12] yet they don't believe it. Come on. They
[57:14] might even jump and they might even
[57:16] shout, but when it comes down to the
[57:18] supernatural things, it's hard for them
[57:20] to grasp. Hallelujah. Come on. But I
[57:24] want to say, just as real as you sitting
[57:26] here this morning, hallelujah. Just as
[57:28] real as those those pews are that you
[57:30] sitting in, just as real as those
[57:33] clothes on that you that you wearing
[57:35] this morning, God is real. Just as real
[57:37] as that. Come on. Amen. This ain't no
[57:41] fairy tale or no hype sermon or that we
[57:44] try to get the people into. But this is
[57:46] some reality we're trying to get you to
[57:48] tap into. Amen. We're trying to get you
[57:51] to tap into the things that are eternal.
[57:53] Hallelujah. Amen. Because when you tap
[57:55] into those things, then you'll let go of
[57:57] these temporal things. Amen. You'll
[57:59] realize that these things ain't going to
[58:01] last forever. And you'll look to the
[58:03] things that's eternal. You'll begin to
[58:06] reaching out for those things that's
[58:08] going to that's got some weight to them.
[58:10] Hallelujah. You'll reach out those
[58:12] things that's got some lasting
[58:14] properties to them. Hallelujah. Cuz you
[58:16] realize heaven and earth will pass away.
[58:18] But the word of God, it'll stand
[58:21] forever. If I hide his word in my heart.
[58:24] Hallelujah. I don't have to worry about
[58:26] fading away. Why? Because the word is in
[58:29] me. Amen. Oh Jesus. Come on. And that's
[58:32] more important than anything. How many
[58:34] believe that this morning? Come on. It
[58:36] is. Come on. But we find that I say is
[58:39] what it is. Come on. They was down here
[58:41] investigating, wasn't it? Come on. I
[58:44] believe angels in the earth
[58:45] investigating today. What a what a mis
[58:48] not a miserable some for the world. It's
[58:50] miserable for you and I is glorious.
[58:52] Amen. What a time we live in today. Come
[58:54] on. Amen. We live in a time, how many
[58:56] can agree with that this morning? Amen.
[58:58] Amen. Where even our politicians
[59:03] debating between things they don't know
[59:05] what's right and wrong. Hallelujah.
[59:07] Amen. Come on.
[59:09] Debating things that shouldn't even be
[59:12] wasted time on. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[59:15] debating what's what's the definition
[59:18] sometimes of a man or a woman. Come on.
[59:21] Amen. Somebody say amen this morning.
[59:23] Amen. Amen. And they going to lock you
[59:24] up if you preach against it. Amen. Hey.
[59:28] Hallelujah. But nevertheless, come on. I
[59:31] believe that wherever you are, if you
[59:34] standing for the word of God, God's got
[59:36] your back. They can throw you in jail.
[59:39] Hallelujah. They can strip everything
[59:41] from you. But my God owns every cattle
[59:44] on the hill. Hallelujah. Long as he
[59:47] lives, I'll live also. Come on. I
[59:50] believe that. Amen. But that's the kind
[59:53] of world we live in. Right. Amen. Don't
[59:55] know the difference between right and
[59:57] wrong. What's happened to the world
[1:00:01] today? People minds have gotten
[1:00:03] confused. Amen. Right. Come on. When
[1:00:07] they Bible says that when they knew God,
[1:00:09] they worshiped him not. Right. as God.
[1:00:12] But they became vain in their own what?
[1:00:14] Imaginations.
[1:00:16] Sometimes people live in such imaginary
[1:00:19] worlds, they don't know how to come out
[1:00:20] of them. Amen. They've been acting and
[1:00:23] pretending for so long, they don't know
[1:00:25] what reality is. Come on. But the word
[1:00:28] of God wants to bring us back to
[1:00:30] reality. Hallelujah. The word of God
[1:00:32] wants to bring us back to what's real.
[1:00:35] How many believe that this morning? Come
[1:00:37] on. But that's the world we live in.
[1:00:40] That's the world they were dealing with
[1:00:41] in that day. Come on. But one thing they
[1:00:44] didn't realize that their lives,
[1:00:47] Hallelujah. The way they were living
[1:00:50] produced a cry, didn't it? Come on. It
[1:00:53] produced a cry. You know, God is
[1:00:56] listening all the time. Heaven is
[1:00:59] listening. How many believe that this
[1:01:00] morning? Amen. Come on. The life that
[1:01:03] you live, the preacher might can't see
[1:01:05] it. Hallelujah. The brothers and sisters
[1:01:07] of your own family might can't see it,
[1:01:10] but God, he sees the life that you live.
[1:01:13] Come on. And that got more weight than
[1:01:15] what everybody else seeing from their
[1:01:17] natural eyes. What's in your heart? God
[1:01:20] can see it. And that's why God judges
[1:01:23] the way he judges. Sometimes we look at
[1:01:26] people and say, "How could God have
[1:01:28] mercy on them?" That's because God heard
[1:01:31] what their heart was saying. God knew
[1:01:33] that they were just caught up in a mess.
[1:01:36] Hallelujah. And if they had chance, they
[1:01:38] get out of it. So God got need to have
[1:01:41] mercy on them. Hallelujah. And I'm so
[1:01:44] glad this morning that that's what God
[1:01:46] looks at. Hallelujah. We all were born
[1:01:48] in a mess. Born in sin, come into a
[1:01:51] world speaking lies. Hallelujah. But God
[1:01:54] knew us. Hallelujah. Before the
[1:01:56] foundation of the world, he knew you.
[1:01:58] Hallelujah. He knew what choices you
[1:02:00] make. He knew you love him. Come on. I'm
[1:02:04] so glad of that this morning. But in
[1:02:07] that hour, hallelujah, the world was so
[1:02:10] wicked, wasn't it? Come on. That that it
[1:02:14] it it produced such a
[1:02:16] cry that God himself, he couldn't he
[1:02:21] couldn't wait until everybody else got
[1:02:23] in that condition. He says, "But we got
[1:02:26] to go down there and see about them
[1:02:28] now." Hallelujah. Right. Come on. world
[1:02:32] in the condition. You know, sometimes
[1:02:34] you say, "How how' they get that into
[1:02:37] that condition?" Come on. How?
[1:02:40] Hallelujah. And I think about even today
[1:02:43] looking at the church world. Oh, it's in
[1:02:45] bad shape. Come on. Real bad shape.
[1:02:49] Sometimes people don't want to, oh, it's
[1:02:51] a good church. It's a good Come on. But
[1:02:54] one thing about it, Hallelujah. The only
[1:02:57] only true church, Hallelujah. They'll be
[1:03:00] living in God. Hallelujah. They'll be
[1:03:03] walking in the way God asked them to
[1:03:05] walk. Hallelujah. But the thing is
[1:03:08] today, everybody want to be the same.
[1:03:10] Everybody want to say, "Let's come
[1:03:11] together." Hallelujah. Cuz we all the
[1:03:14] same. But I want to say this morning,
[1:03:16] we're not the same. Hallelujah. We're
[1:03:20] different. Hallelujah. We born again.
[1:03:22] Hallelujah. We filled with the Holy
[1:03:24] Ghost. Come on. Walking in the light of
[1:03:27] God. Come on. You can't. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:30] Come on now. You can't be the same, can
[1:03:32] you? But what it is, I says what it is.
[1:03:35] You know, I was thinking about in that
[1:03:38] hour. Lot I said sometimes you wonder
[1:03:42] how Lot how in his righteous being a
[1:03:45] righteous person as he was supposed to
[1:03:48] be. How could he stomach living in that
[1:03:51] environment? Come on.
[1:03:54] How could he stomach? Come on. But some
[1:03:57] kind of way he was able to stomach it,
[1:03:59] right? What What caused him to be in
[1:04:04] that environment and didn't mind living
[1:04:06] in that environment? Was it because of
[1:04:08] money?
[1:04:09] Hallelujah. Was it because of
[1:04:12] popularity? Hallelujah. What was it that
[1:04:15] caused caused him to see the condition
[1:04:18] of the people and still want to stay in
[1:04:21] there? Hallelujah. It baffles your mind
[1:04:24] sometimes. says says, "You know, I I
[1:04:27] thought I said some something in him
[1:04:29] should have been disturbed." Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] Something in him should have wanted to
[1:04:34] to get away from all that. But yet he he
[1:04:37] wanted to stay down in there. What was
[1:04:40] it? Hallelujah. It's the same thing that
[1:04:42] drives people today. Hallelujah. Right.
[1:04:46] Same thing that drive people today. But
[1:04:48] I said, what is God in all his infinite
[1:04:51] mercy wanting to Hallelujah? God doesn't
[1:04:55] want to hurt you. Hallelujah. But he
[1:04:57] comes to call you out of those places.
[1:05:00] He comes to call you out and say, "Hey,
[1:05:02] I want you to come unto me. Get it from
[1:05:04] among them." Because if you stay out
[1:05:06] there long enough, you might have good
[1:05:09] intentions, but if you stay out there
[1:05:11] long enough, it's going to contaminate
[1:05:13] you if you stay out there long enough.
[1:05:16] Come on now. I believe that. Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] I'm so glad that God called my name.
[1:05:23] Aren't you glad that God called your
[1:05:25] name? Aren't you glad that something
[1:05:28] just wouldn't sit right with you when
[1:05:30] you were out amongst it? Something just
[1:05:32] wouldn't sit right with you. You knew
[1:05:35] that it was something calling you.
[1:05:37] Hallelujah. It was a purity that you
[1:05:40] wanted and you couldn't be satisfied
[1:05:43] until God spoke the word. Hallelujah.
[1:05:47] And you heard it one day and called you
[1:05:49] out of sin and shame. called you out of
[1:05:53] darkness, called you up to a higher
[1:05:55] plane. Hallelujah. That I can't just
[1:05:59] shout and dance and not see the power of
[1:06:01] God.
[1:06:03] I can't just go to church year in and
[1:06:05] year out and don't have no change. But
[1:06:08] God, I need a change. Hallelujah. God, I
[1:06:11] need you to do something real in my
[1:06:13] life. God, I need the power to change
[1:06:16] me. Oh God, have you ever felt like
[1:06:19] that? Come on. Oh Jesus. I feel like
[1:06:23] that even right now. Come on. Cuz I say
[1:06:26] one thing about it. You know, I believe
[1:06:28] that right now we going to need more
[1:06:29] than what we got. Amen. Come on. The
[1:06:32] devil is ramped up. Y'all believe that?
[1:06:34] Amen. Come on. Amen. The power of Satan
[1:06:36] is ramped up. Come on. Now, what is what
[1:06:40] is God's power to do? He said when the
[1:06:42] enemy come in like a flood, what he say?
[1:06:45] Spirit of the Lord. Spirit of the Lord.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah. It's going to do what? Lift
[1:06:49] up a standard. Come on. Amen. Not your
[1:06:51] own strength. Come on. But it's going to
[1:06:53] be God doing something, taking you on
[1:06:56] into that place. Amen. Sometimes you as
[1:06:59] an individual might see where you need
[1:07:01] to be. But remember, you can't get there
[1:07:03] on your own. It's going to have to take
[1:07:05] something from God. Hallelujah. To swoop
[1:07:07] down and kick pick you up and take you
[1:07:09] into that place. I believe that with all
[1:07:12] of my heart. It's going to have it's
[1:07:14] going to take God to swoop down and get
[1:07:16] you to where you need to be at. That's
[1:07:18] why we always pray, Lord, stir us up
[1:07:21] again. God, refill us again. God, do
[1:07:24] something new in our lives again, God.
[1:07:27] You did it once, God. Do it again.
[1:07:29] Hallelujah. God, show yourself alive and
[1:07:32] well, oh God, by many infallible proofs.
[1:07:35] Do it again, God. Because I need
[1:07:37] something to reignite me, God. I don't
[1:07:40] feel I am where I want to be, God, or
[1:07:42] where I need to be. I need your power. I
[1:07:45] need your anointing. I need it, God.
[1:07:47] Hallelujah. Swoop down and pick me up.
[1:07:50] Send that rusted body when How many feel
[1:07:53] like that this morning? Oh Jesus. Come
[1:07:57] on. But when you know the demons you got
[1:07:58] to fight, that's the way you'll feel.
[1:08:01] Come on. I thought about I thought about
[1:08:04] Elijah. Elisha when he knew that Elijah
[1:08:07] was leaving. Come on. And he realized he
[1:08:10] had to fight some demons, right? He
[1:08:13] realized there was some challenges out
[1:08:15] there. Come on. So he didn't just ask
[1:08:17] for the same. He said, "But I want a
[1:08:19] double portion." Come on. I need a
[1:08:22] little bit more. Hallelujah. Than what
[1:08:24] you got? That's my desire. And God gave
[1:08:27] him that desire, didn't he? But he
[1:08:29] didn't just sit on it, did he? But what
[1:08:31] he did when he got it, what did he say?
[1:08:33] Where is the God of Elijah? Come on. I
[1:08:36] ain't going to just profess to have him,
[1:08:38] but where is he at? Come on. And he
[1:08:41] smoked the waters. And that same God
[1:08:43] showed up. Hallelujah. Sometimes you
[1:08:46] waiting on this one or you waiting on
[1:08:47] that one. But God is the same God.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah. He the God of the old still
[1:08:52] the God of the new. How many believe
[1:08:54] that this morning? Come on, somebody say
[1:08:56] amen. Come on. God is good this morning.
[1:09:00] Come on. I says, "But what it is you can
[1:09:02] you imagine that you know in that hour."
[1:09:05] Come on. Like we say the angels were
[1:09:07] there investigating, wasn't they? Come
[1:09:09] on. They they say we ain't going to just
[1:09:10] destroy but we going to come down and
[1:09:12] see is it all together that bad because
[1:09:15] sometimes things you hear you don't want
[1:09:18] to believe it that it's that bad. Come
[1:09:21] on. But I want to say tell you this
[1:09:23] morning I believe the world has gotten
[1:09:25] that bad. Amen. Come on. The way the
[1:09:28] people mind people minds are
[1:09:31] confused. The young they don't know
[1:09:35] right what's right and wrong sometimes.
[1:09:38] Come on. You say, "What's the what
[1:09:40] what's the blame?" Come on. We know that
[1:09:43] the spirit of this hour, come on. God,
[1:09:46] this presence is lifting off the earth.
[1:09:48] But I says that sometimes you don't even
[1:09:52] want to believe the things you hearing.
[1:09:54] But when they came down to investigate,
[1:09:57] I believe that it was worse than what
[1:09:59] they heard. Right? But one thing I like,
[1:10:02] one thing I I love about even in in this
[1:10:05] position, Abraham, I like how the Bible
[1:10:08] says he stood before the Lord. He showed
[1:10:11] what it was. He showed the path of a
[1:10:14] real Christian, I believe, or the mark
[1:10:16] of a real Christian. Because instead of
[1:10:18] him saying, "Oh, they deserve what they
[1:10:21] going through or what they about to get
[1:10:23] coming upon them." What was Abraham in
[1:10:25] Abraham's heart? He wanted to stand in
[1:10:28] the gap, right? He be to stand before
[1:10:30] the Lord and say, "Lord, I know,
[1:10:33] hallelujah, or your goodness and how
[1:10:35] good you are. I know of your mercy. God,
[1:10:38] if it's 50, Lord, we just spared a
[1:10:41] city." Come on. God said, "I'll spare
[1:10:43] 40, 45, 40 going on down the line."
[1:10:46] Hallelujah. What it was, he was showing
[1:10:49] the mark of a real Christian. Come on.
[1:10:51] Somebody that'll stand before God and
[1:10:53] say, "I know that they worthy of
[1:10:55] judgment, but God have mercy, God. Lord,
[1:10:58] don't destroy them. Lord, give them
[1:11:00] another chance. Please, God, have mercy.
[1:11:03] That's the mark of a real Christian. How
[1:11:05] many people that we see that in today?
[1:11:07] Hallelujah. That's crying down on their
[1:11:10] knees, crying out for the abominations
[1:11:12] that's done in the city. Come on. God
[1:11:14] and wrath remember mercy. We see storms.
[1:11:18] We see wars. We see all these things.
[1:11:20] Come on. But are we just worried about
[1:11:22] me and mine? Hallelujah. But you
[1:11:24] remember when the devil get done with
[1:11:26] your brother or sister, he coming to
[1:11:27] your house next. Come on. That's why we
[1:11:30] pray for one another. Lord, help my
[1:11:32] brother. Help my sister. Whatever they
[1:11:35] going through, help them to get through
[1:11:37] it. God, do something in their life.
[1:11:39] Come on. Oh Jesus. Come on. That's
[1:11:43] crying out of my heart. So many times we
[1:11:45] see that, oh, they going through. Come
[1:11:48] on. But have you prayed? Come on. Have
[1:11:51] you prayed? God is so good. Somebody
[1:11:53] give the Lord a hand clap of praise this
[1:11:55] morning. Oh Jesus. Come on. I says, "But
[1:11:59] in that hour," come on. They came, the
[1:12:00] angels came down, come on to
[1:12:03] investigate. But even in that, I says,
[1:12:07] "What what is it going to take for God
[1:12:10] to get our attention?" Come on. What is
[1:12:13] it going to take for God to get your
[1:12:17] attention? to tell you, to show you that
[1:12:20] he loves you. He don't want to hurt you.
[1:12:22] Come on. To show you that the world
[1:12:26] don't care nothing about you. Don't even
[1:12:28] love its own. So, how's it going to love
[1:12:30] you? Come on. But God loves you. Come
[1:12:34] on. You you you cry that out all the
[1:12:37] time. Hallelujah. Especially for the
[1:12:39] young people, you cry it out because
[1:12:41] what it is, it looks so enticing, right?
[1:12:45] when when Lot from the very beginning
[1:12:47] when he looked over he saw that grass
[1:12:49] was greener, right? Thought, "Oh, I'll
[1:12:52] go over here because the grass was
[1:12:53] greener." But he didn't see up the road
[1:12:55] the trials that he was going to have to
[1:12:57] face. He didn't see when the war broke
[1:13:00] out. Hallelujah. And they took the kings
[1:13:02] captive that was going to take him as
[1:13:04] well. But yet somebody Hallelujah. God
[1:13:07] was going to use Abraham to come get
[1:13:09] him. Hallelujah. But even in that looked
[1:13:12] like he still would have learned his
[1:13:14] lesson. But no, still down there.
[1:13:16] Hallelujah. Come on. What was the what
[1:13:19] was the attraction? What was the draw?
[1:13:21] Hallelujah. But you know one thing about
[1:13:24] it, even when angels came. Come on. And
[1:13:27] that's what we dealing with today. God
[1:13:29] has given you and our word. Come on. A
[1:13:32] word of grace. Amen. That we don't have
[1:13:34] to walk in this world blind. Amen. We
[1:13:37] don't have to not understand what hour
[1:13:39] that we live in. We know what hour we
[1:13:41] live in. We know what's next. We know,
[1:13:45] come on, that Satan is on the move. We
[1:13:48] know that God is calling you and I come
[1:13:50] on up hills. Hallelujah. We know that
[1:13:52] we'll be changed in a moment, in the
[1:13:54] twinkling of an eye. And it could happen
[1:13:57] any time. But yet, people are still
[1:13:59] lingering. Lingering, doing what?
[1:14:01] Playing with their souls. Come on. Not
[1:14:05] knowing that God mean business. And one
[1:14:08] day he'll call for the last time. Amen.
[1:14:11] One day you'll hear the call for the
[1:14:13] last time. Hallelujah.
[1:14:16] Oh Jesus. But I find that I says that
[1:14:20] you know he lingered in that city long
[1:14:23] didn't he? Even after the angels come
[1:14:25] and told them what they purpose
[1:14:28] was. You know the Bible says even then
[1:14:31] that morning they were still there. Come
[1:14:34] on. Lot knows lingering. The Bible says,
[1:14:38] "Why you yet lingered?" What was the
[1:14:41] attraction? Come
[1:14:44] on. But I like how the scripture says,
[1:14:47] "God being merciful." How many glad for
[1:14:49] God's mercy this morning?
[1:14:52] God being merciful. Come on. We nullify
[1:14:57] how good God's mercy is. Come on. We
[1:15:01] don't take that for account. The mercy
[1:15:03] of God. Come on. Many people, many of
[1:15:07] times don't take the account of how the
[1:15:10] mercy of God is on your life. Come on.
[1:15:14] God is having mercy. Whether it's
[1:15:16] somebody praying for you or whether it's
[1:15:18] God just looking out for you, but we
[1:15:20] don't take the account of God's mercy on
[1:15:22] your life. Amen. I was thinking about
[1:15:25] that looking at that. I looked at that
[1:15:26] video. That girl, she was caught in that
[1:15:29] middle. She fell down and hovering that
[1:15:31] baby. I don't know how many rounds they
[1:15:33] said was fire, but I says that mercy of
[1:15:36] God. Can you imagine? Hallelujah. In the
[1:15:40] spirit realm, angels guarding you. Come
[1:15:43] on. Even when you don't even regard the
[1:15:45] Lord, angels guarding you. Even when you
[1:15:47] don't even account for him, angels
[1:15:49] guarding you, standing there. But one
[1:15:52] day, you'll look back and you'll realize
[1:15:54] it that it was God that kept you. You'll
[1:15:57] realize one day that it was God looking
[1:15:59] out for you. It was God that washed over
[1:16:01] you. And I hope that you praise him like
[1:16:04] he ought to be praised. I hope that you
[1:16:07] give him thanks when you realize that.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah. Oh
[1:16:12] Jesus. But we don't take an account many
[1:16:15] times, do we? Come on. I think about
[1:16:17] that. You don't don't take seems to see
[1:16:19] somebody with their leg get um bruised
[1:16:23] and next thing you know gang ring set in
[1:16:26] gone. Something has happened. Sometimes
[1:16:28] might look like little things happen and
[1:16:30] that person gone. He said, "Well, I had
[1:16:32] worse than that happened to me." God had
[1:16:34] mercy on you. Come on. I look at even in
[1:16:38] these storms that's been coming up in
[1:16:41] the last I I've been praying. I said,
[1:16:42] "Lord, no, not again." Praying because I
[1:16:45] know one thing. You ain't secure if
[1:16:47] God's mercy ain't on you. Come on. If
[1:16:50] the angels ain't there, you ain't
[1:16:52] secure. God don't dispatch them. say,
[1:16:55] "Hey, watch over. You're not secure."
[1:16:58] Come on. But you'd be just like
[1:16:59] everybody else, but God has given them a
[1:17:01] charge to watch over you. Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] Why? Because even when they down
