ainy amen I want to say Happy Father's Day again amen forgot all about it till sh that reminded me I think that was Thursday it was going to be Father's Day this today we thank God this morning amen we want to look at the book of St Luke 15 by the grace of God try not to be before you long y'all feel all right this morning amen amen God is good amen St Luke 15 we'll begin at the 11th verse very familiar scripture amen St Luke 15 and 11 if you got it say amen and it reads and he said a certain and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of of the goods that fth to me and he divided unto him them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with righteous living you may be see going read a little further down and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be want and he went to join himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the fields to feed swine and he would Fain have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when when he came to himself he said how many H Servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and no and and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hard servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him said unto him son said unto him father and his son said unto him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on his put it on him put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatest cow and kill it and let us eat and be marry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be married may God had a blessed the reading of his word this morning I like that said he was lost and now he's found amen you had to have been lost to know what it's like to be found right amen I thank God this morning for his grace I know it's you know like we said his father's day and sometimes it's kind of hard to get a little sermon together but I just wanted to preach this morning on my father has more than enough amen my father has more than enough you know and he's got some to spare y'all believe that this morning come on but you got to know who your father is Right amen come on once you understand who your father is now we know we have natural fathers you know and and and some natural fathers you have you have good ones and you have bad ones too amen we might as well say that this morning right but a good father he'll he goes through a lot sometime extent to make sure that the family is all right don't he through the I think about my dad this morning working at construction and sometimes in the Rain the cold he telling us some stories of some of the things he went through just to go down there to have enough money to pay the bills right have food on the tables a lot of times he did without why because he understood what fatherhood was about come on but and that you know sometimes carries over to the children you think about you know uh real responsibilities that you have right that you brought those children into the world right and you have responsibility to take care of them amen some people they just nullify that don't care about that at all right but a good father right he'll take care of his children y'all believe that and there's no father greater than than God himself there's no father greater than him so to think about how much you love your natural children how much more further or greater is God's love to you and I am his love is so great that he was willing to come down and give himself and die for you and I amen I've been reading here this week on in The Book of Mark and how you know when Jesus had to stand before the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the scribes and I was looking at how they mocked him I was looking at how Jesus the Bible says his soul was sorrowful even unto death he was saying father if it be possible let this cup pass but then he said not my will but thy will because he know that the road that was in front of him was a hard road but he loved his children so much Hallelujah he loved you and I so much that though the road was hard he was willing to go the distance that you and I might be able to have eternal life this morning it was a hard Road for him but he was he was the example of a real father wasn't he come on the Bible says they spit on him they mocked him they pull hair out out of his face they hid him inside the head and called them all kind of names they did all kinds of things for him but he loved his children so much right he knew that if he didn't do that then we'd go with out come on we'd be especially you and I as Gentiles we'd be still dogs cast on out but he desired to bring us in he desired to clothe us hallelujah and give us the the bread that was only for the children come on he said it ain't meat to give the CH the the children's bread to the dogs but he desired to give you and I of that bread come on but it was a sacrifice he was going to have to go through to give his children that bread amen but he was that's the thing he was willing to do it though wasn't he come on we didn't have to beg him he did it just because that's what he wanted to do because he loved you and I Hallelujah his love just stretch you think about that the love of God the love of God stretched didn't it it saved the unsavable didn't it it loved the unlovable but God desired to do that right so I says that my father has more than enough you know I can't stand before you and brag on nobody else but Jesus Christ amen amen me and my wife was talking last night I said you know one thing you know I can only preach a certain way amen and then all the glory is got to go to God Amen it's got Jesus Christ is the only reason why I'm here today he's the only he's the only thing I can brag on is him because without him ain't nothing amen come on it's not about being popular and all these things like that who are you anyway nothing but dust right if he hadn't done what he did you wouldn't I wouldn't be here this morning I know I don't have no idea where I'd be at this morning because of the lifestyle I came from but when Jesus came along and that's the thing about it he didn't meet me in a church somewhere he didn't meet me in the finest suit and the biggest place and all that but he met me down in the gutter right where I was at down I was I was telling testimony the other day why because it never gets old telling them where God met me right there in a Motel 6 calling on it what it is my father Hallelujah some sometimes you got to shake yourself but we're talking here my father has more than enough right we see here you know what happened to this in this setting of scripture this young man right he was no doubt he was raised in a good home wasn't he and we going to talk about not just for the young man but the young girls too amen right he raised in a good home amen wasn't he but but it was something about you know maybe he thought he was being uh uh withheld from something in life right maybe can look at the other young people all thought maybe he was missing out on something but one thing that he that he didn't know and that's what I say is a lot of times everybody want to be grown before the time amen can I say it like that amen come on everybody want to be grown way before the time yeah man I want to do my own thing I want to but you don't understand what the cost is to be grown sometimes right can I say it like that this morning come on now you don't understand what the cost is to be grown sometimes you don't understand the the the the hard roads the long nights the pain the getting up doing things when you don't feel like it but you ain't got nobody else to depend on but God hallelujah come on you trust in him every day but if you out there on your own on the island you know you're not looking to God you don't understand sometimes everybody want to be grown don't they come on but the thing is this young man though though he went out he went out that and and and things I says that you know uh uh it was certain experiences in life that he had to try because the devil sometimes when you're looking at it looks like a good time don't it looks like the world in itself is they having such a good time but you don't see behind the scenes hallelujah amen you don't see those nights Hallelujah when danger was right around the corner but if it wasn't for the Hedge and somebody praying amen come on amen amen but if God was to lift his hands off just a little bit amen come on but what happens the devil shows you the good time don't it and that we you sometimes you can be old and the devil still show you that don't it but what it is you got to taste and see that the Lord is good you once you taste of the Lord you'll know there's nothing greater than what he has for you hallelujah amen oh Jesus but we find out I says that you know he went out and wanted to experience certain things in life but one thing about it when he went out to experience life in the Good Time come on he didn't know what the value was of what he had come on he didn't know it because it was given to him that's right so he didn't know what it cost to get it amen amen hallelujah amen so that's why he could waste it away cuz he didn't know the value of it sometimes we don't know what the value how much it cost amen Hal Hallelujah for us to wake up this morning am with good health amen hallelujah amen with a car to drive with food to eat amen we don't know what the cost is amen Jesus does don't he amen cuz he paid the price for you and I to have joy this morning we don't know what the cost is amen oh Jesus to have peace we don't know what that cost was it was a high price amen some body paid the price amen but when you don't know the value of it you'll take it for granted amen won't you amen come on now amen but I thank God every day thank you for paying the price amen this is the day that the Lord has made we'll rejoice and be glad therein Hallelujah come on now don't let me preach by myself this morning amen come on now do you got joy this morning amen come on do you have a smile on your face this morning do you have peace are you in good health this morning come on recognize the value of it the value of your health was the stripes that was laid on his back oh Jesus Lord he paid the price didn't he come on yes he did oh Jesus come on I ain't going to be guilty of not thanking him for paying the price am come on I ain't going to be guilty of not saying Thank You Lord amen give it God glory I ain't going to be guilty of it cuz I realize the value of it I realize where I should have been this morning but God has blessed me Hallelujah to be alive and well oh Jesus so I ain't going to waste my time away I ain't going to waste that breath away but I'm going shout hallelujah every time I get a chance amen I'm a press every time I get a chance Hallelujah [Music] but he didn't know the value of it did he come on that's why he can waste it away ain't it come on you know it's somebody in pain this morning you know that somebody in the hospital this morning amen somebody down in the in can we say down in the dumps this morning amen come on Amen but God has blessed you and I hasn't he but I says that what is he didn't know the value of it so he went when he when you don't really uh know the value of it you'll go away and you'll just waste it away right because it's just given but that even that inheritance that he got from his father his father had to pay a price for that inheritance come on but he didn't see that and that's what it is I said sometimes we just look at the glory of of certain things inside but we don't know the cost of it amen amen come on I thought about those Heroes of Faith in the Bible sometimes we want signs and wonders Miracles power to follow your life amen but you got to realize it was a cost to get that it was some sacrifices to get it it was some prices to pay wasn't it am come on no cross no Crown amen ain't that the truth come on my thought about Moses the Bible says he for took Egypt and all its riches yes he didn't want to be called Pharaoh's uh the son of Pharaoh's daughter he forsook all of that amen come on because even though he know what he was going into slavery or whatever it might have been but he saw value in it amen somehow in that he saw power in that that was greater than all the treasures in Egypt yes amen he was looking through a different set of eyes am hallelujah amen that's what we looking through this morning amen a different set of eyes amen come on many times you had opportunities to do certain things make certain money and all that but you forsook it Allen why because you know that God has something greater amen come on Amen I ain't got to get what the devil off of me and all this and make this up my father has more than enough amen oh Jesus he owns every cattle on the hill don't he oh Jesus God is so good this morning ain't he come on but we look at the glory but not knowing it was a sacrifice right people look at the glory of Paul's life but it was a sacrifice wasn't it amen come on now I'm talking about forsaking all amen these Heroes of Faith they forsook everything that's hard for people to do today amen come on forsake it all walk away from everything amen That's mighty hard to do today amen come on but what it is the only thing that'll make you do that you got to see what you forsaken it for is greater than all that amen hallelujah God's got to open your eyes that you'll be able to see oh Jesus Jesus amen oh Hallelujah am come on God got to open our eyes this morning don't we come on but what it is you know your running ain't in vain can I say that this morning come on all your running ain't in vain the devil tell you that but your running ain't in vain come on keep pressing God's got a Crown of Life stored up for you when all the other ones going out doing this and saying they having a good time and all that come on wait until the end now amen wait until the end when you hear him say Well done you fought you pressed you endured you forsook all amen hallelujah amen oh that's what gives me joy unspeakable and full of Glory because the devil can't lie to me enough to tell me that serving God ain't the right thing to do hallelujah oh Jesus amen come on now amen hallelujah amen but he didn't he didn't understand the value of what he had did he come on when you don't understand the value you wasted away won't you and that's what he did it didn't take long did it threw it all away then one of the one of the cruel realities that he found out was the world don't care nothing about you amen he found that out and when he found that out he was in a far country too amen right amen he wouldn't know where where Mom and Dad could come to the rescue he found it out in a far country that the world don't owe you nothing amen and they don't care nothing about you amen hallelujah amen how many found that out this morning oh I found that out at an early age the Bible say the boy was hungry and nobody gave him nothing amen hallelujah amen they didn't give him no bread no water they ain't care nothing about him Hallelujah but my father has more than enough nobody don't care for You Like Jesus Does Can't Nobody Do You Like Jesus amen hallelujah not mama not Daddy nobody can't do you like Jesus Hallelujah the Bible says when your mother and father forsake you God will take you up he'll take time with you warning oh I'm so glad God takes time with the nobodies come on Amen yes oh Jesus amen God takes time with the Down and Out amen the common people God takes time with them ain't you glad for that this morning somebody say who you think you is it don't matter who I am is who he is and I'm his child Hallelujah no it ain't about me it's always been about him oh Jesus Hallelujah Lord come on but I said that what it is he he realized that in in a fast way you can tell young people that all the time the world don't care nothing about you your little friends they don't care nothing about you amen all they care about my daddy used to tell me that all the time he says once you you'll find out who who your friends are not when you car break down my daddy used to tell me that you'll find out who your friends is when you cop break down and that is the truth ain't it you'll find out then who real and who ain't come on but I said that you know in all those things he found that out in a cruel way didn't he come on but then he got he got to a point come on he got to a point in his life to where now you know first off he going to feed the swine that was like something like an Abomination or something but not only is is uh uh he going to do this certain job now but he's about to go further down because his appetite come on he's got so hungry that he's willing to eat anything right he got so hungry he's beat down by life hallelujah what he was being sheltered from he found out what life was all about then come on and it beat him down so bad that now he's willing to eat that stuff ain't he come on but before he ate I like how the Bible says he shook himself Hallelujah come on now amen oh Jesus somebody got to shake their self maybe somebody's at that point Hallelujah where they about to eat but you better Shake Yourself amen hallelujah amen Shake Yourself this morning wake up amen oh God but you know I was thinking about it I thought about a little testimony I says you know the devil when the devil is your master he'll take you to some extremes you say I won't go you'll go wherever your master tell you to go you'll do whatever your master tell you to do come on cuz he's your master right I thought about once this happened years ago now I was on the job and one boy he was strung out on oxycotton and I was he was so strung out so bad his family and all them tried to get him help sent him to rehab after rehab he's be good for couple of months he come back he strung out again CU of some bad doctor giving him prescriptions after prescriptions come on but he's at work one day out there at work on a little table he's telling me Ernest this is years your now is way back like an 0405 or something he say Ernest he says man try one of these pieces he said it'll take you some places man just try one please he was begging me to try a piece of that oxycotton he had it a razor blade cutting it in four pieces and I said no I don't think I'm going to try none of that I hadn't been saved too long but what God had did for me I knew was way better than those oxycotton come on Amen but a forlift came by and swung Ron and they exhaust from it blew all those pills off the table I walked off because he panicked but what what the Lord allowed me to see when I walked off and I turned around you know that boy was on his knees digging through the dirt looking for those pieces I sat there and watched him for a while digging through the dirt looking for those pieces and he think I think he found all of them but one but he was upset they little tiny little pieces digging through the dirt looking for them what it was his master come on Amen had a hold on him maybe if you have told him he'd be like that one day maybe he have told you I'd never go that distance that's right that's right come on but when the master when the demon with the addiction somebody introduced it to him somewhere somehow amen amen come on Amen and it had such a stronghold on his life amen he diging through the dirt looking for it amen come on amen he used to tell me say man Ernest I don't know why but I beat my wife up so bad last night come on his master got a hold of him come on he met me one day and asked me to come pray with him I prayed with him just hard as I could in the bathroom because I knew that what it was the devil had hold to him he wasn't born like that something happened to him come on he came from a good family had money come on but when the devil get hold to you he don't care what family you part of he don't care if your daddy's a preacher your daddy's a bishop or whoever amen amen the Devil is a devil amen come on but pray Prayer Changes Things amen prayer Hallelujah has a way to break yolks amen unhooked chains oh Jesus amen I like how Moses message was Let My People Go hallelujah amen amen you've been holding them long enough let them go amen that they might serve the Living God how many want to be let go this morning oh Jesus come on now Lord but what happens I says that the devil will take you that far he had this young man that far didn't he come on but one thing about it I like how the Bible I like how the Bible says you know when when he came to himself come on when he when he shook himself come on and maybe maybe shaking himself just dramatizing it he thought about the good times in his father's house amen hallelujah come on he went back in his mind maybe of the good times Amen in his father's house he thought about all his wrongs and where it all started at come on amen he thought about it Hallelujah I think about Samson standing there with his with his locks cut off sometimes come on but in his eyes plucked out but in memory Hallelujah he can remember when God used to use am he can remember the anointing and how good it felt to praise the Lord oh Jesus come on the me the mind is a powerful thing ain't it but something clicked with on the inside of him I Believe come on he begin to say in My Father's House amen hallelujah amen he's got more than enough I said my father has more than enough this morning amen come on I'm out here perishing with Hunger amen bounded to the devil all these things but in my father's house he has more than enough I'm going home hallelujah amen oh Jesus thank you Lord I'm going home Hallelujah you know one thing about it I says the road back was through repentance amen amen come on Amen it wasn't just I'm going go back and just be back like that but the road back

back that road back was through repentance wasn't it come on Godly sorry something in this something not I said something in him clicked I like that how the Bible says he when he he got hold to
