[37:22] where there's so much
[37:25] hate walls and room of walls violence
[37:30] everywhere
[37:32] amen think the prophet of God
[37:37] says the bride would be the only one
[37:39] that have the love of
[37:41] God are you with
[37:44] me and I want to know are you
[37:49] bride amen it's not what you say amen
[37:53] amen see he said Jacob have our love and
[38:00] Esau we love him because he first us he
[38:04] first loved uslu are you with me so it's
[38:08] a love that God had for
[38:12] us and even when we were yet sinners and
[38:16] enemies in our minds by Wicked Works
[38:19] Christ loved us am and he died for us
[38:22] amen are you with me amen so
[38:28] beyond the curtains of time going beyond
[38:30] the curtains of time what is that really
[38:33] we talking about Out of Body Experience
[38:36] the prophet had that he was talking
[38:39] about Paul caught up in the third heaven
[38:42] in the body out the body that cannot
[38:44] tell whether sleep awake or in a vision
[38:46] he says
[38:48] but I left I saw my body laying on the
[38:52] bed and I went to a place and he calls
[38:56] it beyond the curtains of time and he
[39:00] says he went there and he he described
[39:02] the place somewhat like this he said I
[39:05] Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that
[39:09] was in the room said this is what you
[39:14] preach was the Holy
[39:16] Ghost this is perfect
[39:19] love are you with me this is perfect
[39:25] love and nothing can enter
[39:30] here without it
[39:33] amen so he says I'm more determined than

[51:25] spirits
[51:27] and they'll walk with those spirits and
[51:30] you know until those Spirits are
[51:35] released it's almost like the lunatic
[51:37] man that's wanted to U punch the prophet
[51:41] he said you'll fall on my
[51:43] feet
[51:45] but it's it's it's like that he said is
[51:48] the devil going to know he loves that
[51:52] spirit and a lot of times people that
[51:55] think they're religious they got to hold
[51:57] to those Spirits I ain't going to let
[51:59] this go I know I DET turn right I know
[52:03] I'm
[52:04] right right what I know I'm telling the
[52:08] truth what truth hey it's all right it's
[52:13] all
[52:14] right oh calm down it's all
[52:17] right praise
[52:20] God but you see you have to deal with
[52:23] that until a person get the Holy Ghost
[52:26] you have to try to talk them into being
[52:29] calm being cool and Collective you know
[52:33] it's going to be all right we know
[52:35] you're a baby and babies do these things
[52:39] he said when I was a child I thought as

[53:53] that he would Grant you
[53:57] God got to granted to you that he would
[53:59] Grant you according to the riches of his
[54:03] glory to be strengthened with the might
