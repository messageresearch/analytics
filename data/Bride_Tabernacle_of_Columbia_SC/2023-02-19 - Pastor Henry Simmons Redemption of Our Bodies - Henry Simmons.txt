Book of Romans 8 and 14. Romans 8 and 14. it said I read the first you read the next we read the 23rd verse together God is good amen they said in Kentucky Ashburn College then Revival of the youth to stand around day in and day out people are coming for miles around they're in Revival at the college there and um they're praying night and day and has moved there and my wife's just telling me that I knew her I saw the winner about Kentucky but she says there's one going on in Ohio to Utah in Revival there and then it's another place on another college campus about three college campuses they're coming from all over they're praying night and day I said if they're doing this praise God then where's the bride Revival are you the young people are stirred there God is moving amen Romans 8 and 14 and I read the first year reading the next for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God 15. a spirit itself that Witness with our spirits that we are the children of God 17. for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US 19. for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of the same who has subjected the same in Hope 21. for we know that the whole creation groanings and travail in pain together until now together and not only they but we ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to the wit the Redemption of our bodies God bless you towards you may be seated this morning I guess we continue in the phase we're talking about the book of redemption we talked about amen the day of redemption we talked the sealed to the day of redemption now we're talking about the Redemption of the body this morning so continually on Redemption Redemption then amen that God frees us from the guilt and the penalty of sin amen the the transgressions amen God sets us free from that he redeems us amen then we talked about the abstract title Dee the book of redemption that God everything that Adam and lost was given back to us amen so everything that out of a loss in the garden and through sin God has restored redeemed us and amen given us made us journales with him Christ amen everything that Christ has we know that as he said servant of God said all that Christ wants he quoted all the God was he put it into Christ and all that Christ was he put it into the church are you with me so we realized that what was lost has been restored are you with me but we'll still we're still dealing with this body amen am I but look like my whole head has turned gray and um look like in this life we still deal with a little bit of pain and trouble and sorrow though we've been redeemed and we've everything has been restored back we've done amen here it says in Romans um 24 for we're saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man sees why does he yet hope for but if we hope for that which we see not then we then do we were patient what wait for amen amen so he says likewise the spirit also happened to our infirmity for we know not what we should pray for as we all but the spirit itself make its intercession for us with groans which cannot be uttered and he that searches of the heart knows what is the mind of the spirit because he make an intercession for the Saints according to the will of what will of God and we know that all what we work together for what good to them that love God to to them who are the what who are the call according to purpose for whom he did for knowing he also did to be conformed to image of his son that he might be the firstborn or what my many brethren amen it says over whom he did predestinate them he also and whom he called them he also and whom he justified them he glorify amen God is good isn't that right we're serving a good God and when I talk about uh the Redemption of the body amen we know that our souls amen God has given us of his spirit amen God has given us as as we see you know oftentimes he said let the redeem of the Lord say so that means we identified we did with Redemption we'll we've been redeemed and we know that the blood of Jesus Christ has redeemed us amen we have Redemption to his blood even the forgiveness of sin are you with me through the blood of Jesus Christ our sins have been forgiven now this body is a constantly reminder so as long as we got this uh body and we're in this body then amen we have a reminder amen of of sin and what happened in the penalty in the price and every ache and every pain we feel not only do we feel that in this body but while we're in this body amen though God has fully restored us Amen in what the blood has done it has done the work that was required amen because of justice and because of the penalty of sin the price has been paid but as long as we're in this body we have a constant reminder of what happened in the garden and how what happened to man because of Disobedience to the word amen so because man disobeyed God Amen every time amen every inch every pain every sorrow every death everything to happen is a reminder if man had not sinned we would not have pain will it not have sorrow will not have all this disappointing now we even in our minds there's a wall constantly going on because sin causes corrupt not only Corruption of the body but Corruption of the Mind amen so and until God transformed us our minds also through the blood of Jesus Christ had the the power of trans he said I beseech your brethren by the mercy of God that you want that you won't worthy amen God knew that we would go through something within our spirit and within our minds so we needed our minds transformed he said I beseech your brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice why because we're talking about the Redemption of the bodies but he said now that we're in this flesh he said that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice why amen this body I don't care when you're born in this world you start dying because why your your days are numbered and your steps even a numbered and when you're born in this world you started you look like you you you're living but you're dying daily Paul said I Die daily I put a I said we're born to die that's why he said a man that was born of a woman a few days and full of trouble so death started working and we'd fight to live because we are in this world we want to live when a baby is born sometimes the baby go through certain sickness and Transitions and things why because debate a mother a father they want a child to live life is valuable it means something yet the body that the hands sometimes traumatized it goes through changes there's all kind of diseases there's all kind of plagues all kind of things that a baby can go through and as we grow in life things just happen it says what he says here that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice so Paul is saying that I want you to come and I want you to give this body that you have as a Living Sacrifice to God he said holy and acceptable to God if you look at your body or you that you are you giving that's a body to God as a Living Sacrifice who are you living for amen are you living for God are you presenting your body as Christians we should present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice knowing that this body here is not the real thingy this body here is a is a product of sin so because it's a product of sin I want to present this body as a Living Sacrifice because God is even though this body amen was born in sin shaping in the nicotine amen God do amen has a a put in this body attraction yeah he said he put a tragic in the Earthly vessels this body houses amen the divine nature it houses amen uh a holy God amen because we have accepted what the blood has done and because of the blood of Jesus the the body amen amen is the temple of the Holy Ghost so in this Temple amen I want it to be holy and I I presented as a Living Sacrifice I have a reason why it's a reason why I want you to present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice it's a reason why it won't hurt you amen it's a blessing to do it it's not it's not something that's going to make you know when the world is styling and falling and and trying to look Purity and cute amen you want to be holy when the world even has its own fashion in his own look you want to look like Jesus you want to live like Jesus you want to be like Jesus amen but the world got his own thing going they met because the world don't want to present their bodies as a Living Sacrifice I'm talking about the Redemption of our bodies amen I'm talking about you're looking forward to something you got you know you got Heaven on your mind praise God so when we're wrapped up tied up take it up and cannot see the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that has appeared we cannot see what the blood has achieved praise God that I don't look at this body amen as something that's Eternal but I look at a temporal body something that I had temporary praise God it's not gonna last it's correct it's corrupt praise God Joel said dust I on Dust I shall return are you a man naked came unto this word nothing shall I return amen we bought nothing in this world we can't carry nothing out without character are you with me so he said holy and acceptable amen so here holding acceptable unto God which is our which is your what it's your reasonable service praise God what can I give God I can present my bodies as a Living Sacrifice why because it states that you bought with the price oh you're with me if you uh recognize you've been redeemed you've been watched in the blood of the Lamb then ought to present my bodies as a Living Sacrifice this body don't belong to me I've been bought with the price thank you Jesus the blood Hallelujah praise God hallelujah we we've been purchased by his blood are you with the blood of Jesus said paid the price praise God all I have I owe it to Jesus praise God all my life oh everything to him praise God for what he's done for me praise God my body belongs to God everything that God belonged to God oh God for the Lord give amen amen amen praise Hallelujah which is my reasonable service and he says and be not what conform to the world is Ever Changing but he remains [Music] Jesus remained the same amen amen you can't keep up with this world you'll be broke busted and disgusted are you with me so don't try to keep up with this world because you'll be in trouble the world you go from one fashion to another one look to another look oh God you trying to keep up praise God trouble in your mind trouble in the spirit young people trying to buy the right shoes and wear the right clothes and and all of that little shoes commercials cost to 200 yo it's called 500 but oh Lord we caught up trying to please not God but trying to please the world amen we need to see whether or not we can please God amen will be persecuted by the world but thank God that's what I'm sacrificing now amen I'm going to be prosecuted but thank God it's worth it are you with me for there's no suffering of those present time she is worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be run reveal in US amen amen if I suffer I'll reign if I live right Heaven belong to me but sometimes we don't we want to conform we want to look good that will be accepted by the world not accepted by God but we want to be accepted by friends and we don't want the peer pressure of the world we don't want they meant to look like you know we want to look like the world act like the world be like the world be accepted amen live in a world Amen that's falling apart and has no eternity in it it has only here and now and it'll be ending after a while he said be not conformed this world will be you what transformed by what renewing of your mind your mind has to be renewed because amen the mind that we had was corrupt it was a sinful mind the Bible said we in our minds amen we had we were enmity with God we were fighting against God's Will and God's purpose for our lives amen we were it was enmity amen amen so by the grace of God he says renew another law of mind that we that ye might prove what is that what that good and what you know what we do how we conduct Our Lives is it acceptable who is it pleasing God is it acceptable to him do we ask the question do we sit down and do we pray about what we do do we ask God will you be pleased with it uh we uh uh are we going to be like Kane don't care amen came God God didn't accept his sacrifice because it wasn't pleasing in his sight isn't that right but God was pleased with evil sacrifice isn't that right and then it caused jealousy are you with me the world gonna hate you [Music] are you with me but he said love not the world neither do I amen now don't fashion yourself after the world Amen but put on the whole arm of God put on the word of God Amen let's look at the one that's going to say you you've been accepted because you chose the hard way praise God you've chosen to despise we the rejected waited straight As the gate now is the way but that's the way you chose praise God because that's the way God would have you to walk the street and narrow way but Broad and wide is the way to lead to what destruction Amen brother where you going sister where you going where you hiding amen let's try to please God not ourselves let's not try to please our friends and our neighbors and our amen and the fellow employees let's try to please God what is God is in crime what is God looking fall when he looks at a Christian and when he looks at you what he want it doesn't matter Cain it didn't matter God says uh evil your sacrifice being accepted then he said Cain was wrong he said hey don't it's no problem just do what he did and you'll you'll be accepted too but we take the attitude I'm not going to do what God says up amen I'm not going to please God I'm gonna please myself I'm a police God if you can't accept what I give you then forget it I'll find another church it's not about the church it's about the word it's not about a preacher it's the word praise God are you pleasing God I want you to come in contact with him praise God somebody said I believe the message what is it are you a Christian do you know Christ do you have a relationship with him so what are you talking about praise God Amen I'm talking about being a Christian I'm talking about living for God I'm not talking about I'm a message believer I'm talking about do you know Jesus don't matter in the name of your church or what you claim do you know him have you been washed in the blood have you accepted what Jesus did for you who do you wash it are you worshiping Jesus Christ oh it's a man or some church or some denomination are you up we got to please Jesus I'm afraid that people are leading people to their church and not the crisis that's what the servant of God said oh blessed lead this message all these Mysteries mystified oh let's leave this over here let's leave that over there let's get to Christ first amen amen he'll teach you all things if you get him first amen thank God Amen Hallelujah thank God for the message thank God for the mistress amen because that's what we're feeding on unfailing body word of the son of man that's what we're feeding on we're not feeding on something denomination to create a Dogma we're defeated on the word are you with me but look what people made it just something to be a part of something to connect up with everybody want to connect up with something some church some Creed some dog or some philosophy some way of doing things but not the person the person of Jesus Christ you and him having a relationship you you knowing god amen God Amen has been led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God isn't that right about as long as I please what I think what it ought to be accepted in the church on the job as a Christian remember that I look like a Christian to the people in the world Amen but what is your are you pleasing God do you have a relationship does he talk with you does he walk with you does he leads you does he guard you but we feel comfortable just being traditional believers just coming to church and being traditional they've been just listening to a message or just

cattle lost everything praise God was one of the richest man in the east he lost everything and the devil will wanted him to forget God they lost everything and even his wife says you got full of Swords ball laws on it why don't you just curse your God and die told his wife you thought like I wanted a foolish women praise God he you know sometimes look like things ain't going your way in you're like one thing I said if it's not one thing it's another and sometimes you know it looked like something telling you to give up don't even know whether God's with you don't even know whether God is for you what I heard in Romans 8 he said who's laying a thing to the charge of God tonight if God be what if God be false who can are you with me you see what I'm saying regardless of what's going on in your life if God be for you who can be against you and I I want you to know God is on your side God is for you in the midst of what you're going through that's a God that's real and it's a lie Joe come to the the point that you know sometimes you have to encourage yourself when all kind of negativity David encouraged himself in the Lord all kind of negative stuff even the men that was

moving into adoption are you a man but if you don't move into adoption then you'll be still groaning are you with me but once you move into adoption I believe the opening of the word is bringing us to a place of adoption to placing to positioning yourself because the word the seals have been taken off the book to put you in a position are you with me but people say well what is adoption amen he said waiting for the adoption to the wit praise God you know this morning as I prayed and meditated on the Lord I said Lord what happened the people were so in anticipation for body change at that particular time the good day finding what's in their mind the thousands of years would take place you know some people say I don't believe no more I don't believe Paul message you no more because why Paul said It's Gonna Come shortly amen all these people are talking about the coming of the Lord is not and all of that ain't nothing happened yet it's been a thousand years and you know is the Bible
