Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance what? incorruptible &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; unto God &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; that fade not away. &gt;&gt; Reserve where? &gt;&gt; In heaven for you. &gt;&gt; Who are kept by what? &gt;&gt; The power of God &gt;&gt; through faith unto what? &gt;&gt; Salvation. &gt;&gt; Ready to be what? &gt;&gt; Revealed in the last time, &gt;&gt; weigh in yely what? &gt;&gt; Rejoice. Though now for a season, if need be ye are in what? &gt;&gt; That the trial of your what? &gt;&gt; Being much more precious than what? &gt;&gt; Though it be tried might be found unto what? &gt;&gt; Praise and honor and glory at the Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the reading of his word. You may be seated. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; The trial of your faith. We said we would just continue on on on faith. We were speaking on the key to the door and that key to the door. Faith is the key to every situation and everything that we face. And we were saying that we are it it's it's been said that the church itself has lost the key. The church as a whole has lost the key. The key to the door is faith. And we're living in a a a society, in a time where the church want to see God move, but they lost the key. &gt;&gt; They want to see, Amen. the the miraculous take place, but they lost the key. &gt;&gt; The key. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, um the reason why we have lost the key, Amen, to the door, Amen, because the key is used to lock and unlock, right? &gt;&gt; So, the reason why the church as a whole has lost the key, &gt;&gt; there's a lack of faith. The Bible tells us in Hebrews, he that cometh to God must first of all believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; He said without faith it's impossible &gt;&gt; to please him. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise God. With without faith, YOU DON'T YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE IS whether or not the Amen. the church is going to trust God. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; HAVE CONFIDENCE in God and faith in God. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT WHETHER OR NOT WE JUST WANT TO come Amen. and uh just COME AND FELLOWSHIP AND HAVE uh communion is just like a it's a ritual a tradition OR HAVING JUST A CLUB &gt;&gt; OR SOME TYPE OF RELIGIOUS SOCIETY &gt;&gt; OR do but we're NOT HERE AMEN. JUST TO COME TRADITIONALLY. WE WANT TO SEE GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO SEE GOD IN OUR LIVES. WE WANT TO SEE GOD IN OUR MIDST. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT JUST GOING THROUGH THE FORM AND AMEN. THINKING THAT IT'S ALL RIGHT TO SING. IT'S ALL RIGHT TO AMEN. JUST TO HAVE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO SEE GOD. &gt;&gt; So we would see Jesus. &gt;&gt; The trial. Your faith will be tested. Your faith will be tested and tried. YOU KNOW WHY? NOW THE Bible tells us that faith come by what? &gt;&gt; Hearing. &gt;&gt; And hearing by the what? &gt;&gt; Word of God. &gt;&gt; The word OF GOD. NOW WHEN THE WORD SPEAKS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE TELLS US THAT MAN SHALL NOT LIVE by bread ALONE BUT BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; EVERY WORD. &gt;&gt; EVERY WORD that proceeded OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD. WE THINK THAT WE CAN GET BY JUST DOING SOME. &gt;&gt; I JUST DO AS MUCH as I, you know, you know, if I don't, IF I DON'T LIKE THAT PART, I JUST PUT IT TO THE SIDE. &gt;&gt; But you got to Amen. obey every word. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU REJECT PART OF THE WORD, ANY WORD, AMEN. YOU'RE REJECTING GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GO AHEAD. Then how can you have faith IN HIM YOU NOT HEARD? AND HOW CAN YOU HEAR WITHOUT A PREACHER? &gt;&gt; AND HOW CAN HE PREACH EXCEPT he be sent? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I was telling because it's a it's a great problem. People are he said why people can't come on one accord. See before you can come on one accord WITH ONE ANOTHER YOU GOT to become on one accord with God. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; IT TALKS ABOUT THE DAY OF PENTECOST. They were all in one place and Amen. And then suddenly there came a sound from heaven. Amen. That they was in one place and they was on ONE ACCORD. AMEN. AND THEN THE HOLY GHOST FELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PEOPLE GOT TO GET ON ONE ACCORD, NOT WITH ONE ANOTHER, BUT WITH GOD. I THINK WE'RE TOO BUSY TRYING TO GET ON ONE CALL WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NOT WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; TRYING TO GET ON ONE ACCORD WITH THE CHURCH OR WITH THE BISHOP OR WITH THIS ONE OR THAT ONE AND NOT WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; WE MUST BECOME ON ONE ACCORD WITH THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. &gt;&gt; IF THE WORD SAID IT, I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO DON'T believe it. I believe THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE ITSELF is all absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. IT DON'T NOBODY TAKES THE PLACE OF THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; NO PREACHER, NO CHURCH, AMEN. NO BISHOP, NO WHO? I DON'T CARE WHAT. &gt;&gt; NO PROPHET, NOBODY TAKES THE PLACE OF THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE IS YOUR ABSOLUTE. &gt;&gt; SEE, faith come by hearing. and and and we we we say we preaching on faith, but you got to know that faith come by hearing and hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now, when you doubt just one &gt;&gt; just one word, &gt;&gt; just one word in the Bible &gt;&gt; caused all the sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil convinced Eve that she wasn't going to die. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Uh if you you ain't going to die. Just no. You're not going to die. &gt;&gt; God said the day you eat, you going to die. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; If she knew that you WAS GOING TO DIE AND cause all the sin and all the corruption. Amen. And people always say, "Well, Adam this and that and that." The Bible say Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived. Amen. Being in the transgression. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's why he said, "Amen. Let your women learn in silence with all suggestion." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we don't have women preachers. &gt;&gt; Because, Amen. She was equal with Adam at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Now, he going to be your head." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are y'all Are y'all with me? &gt;&gt; The man is going to be the head because she messed up. Now you said, "Why Adam going to be a head?" He messed up, too. That's God's business. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You leave God alone. He know what he doing. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I ain't got no problem with it. &gt;&gt; Anybody got any problem with the word? &gt;&gt; We going to tell God how to do things. &gt;&gt; Amen. God said it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, by the grace of God, see, people have problem with God. Why did God say this? Why did God I don't believe he meant that. I don't Nope. Every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Whether you understand it or not, &gt;&gt; if God said it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me go back over here in Peter. He says in the seventh verse, he says, "So many good things up above till I if I did it, I'll be here." Oh, oh, a long time. He says, I do the fourth verse. Oh, okay. Thank you. Oh, I go to the third verse. Oh, goodness. Let me go to the second one then. Okay. He said, "Elect according to the full knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit." Sometime folk don't want to be sanctified. &gt;&gt; Sanctification come Amen. by God. You got to be sanctified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God want to wash you clean. You sanctify them through thy truth. He said thy what? &gt;&gt; Word. &gt;&gt; The word is truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing wrong with being sanctified. Let God wash you with the water OF THE WORD. LET GOD CLEAN YOU UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Somebody say, "I don't need to be washed." &gt;&gt; Amen. God wash us from our filthiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said, "Amen. Cleanse us from all filthiness of the flesh and the spirit &gt;&gt; that we might perfect holiness in the fear of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because we got a father that requires that. &gt;&gt; Okay. I I got to get until until the obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace be unto you. You think he's talking to them back there and not talking to you? &gt;&gt; I believe he's talking to us, too. &gt;&gt; You and peace be multiplied. Blessed be God in the father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a what? &gt;&gt; By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to a what? &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. You have an inherit I I I know you're talking to me cuz I I'm receiving that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I got an inheritance that's incorruptible. &gt;&gt; And that's what makes me excited. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not serving the Lord FOR NOTHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS promised you something. &gt;&gt; And you must Amen. RECOGNIZE GOD HAS PROMISED ME SOMETHING. I'M NOT SERVING the Lord for nothing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY GOD HAS PROMISED ME AN INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; An inheritance incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; And it's what? &gt;&gt; It's undefiled. And it what? Faith is not &gt;&gt; faith is not in his reserve. &gt;&gt; It's waiting on me. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I GO TO PREPARE A place for you that where I am, there ye may be also." &gt;&gt; IT'S RESERVED FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; You ain't excited. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If somebody Amen. uh somebody had a couple billion dollars and said, "Amen. Praise God. you have I I'm going to give you so and so. I'm going to give you a few 10 million and and you don't be excited. SEE THE REASON WHY the church is not excited because they not they think God speaking to somebody else. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHEN WE KNOW GOD is speaking to us, it gives us SOMETHING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm happy. AMEN. BECAUSE I GOT CERTAIN TO BE HAPPY ABOUT. &gt;&gt; I GOT AN INHERITANCE. IT'S INCORRUPTIBLE. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It don't fade away. &gt;&gt; It's reserved in heaven for me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you feel like it, Lord, but you ain't talking to me. You're talking to somebody. It look like it's foreign somewhere off somewhere. It's a distance. It's distant from us. But when it becomes real to you, &gt;&gt; when your faith can say, "Lord, thank you." &gt;&gt; Your faith is saying, "Lord, you're speaking to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I believe that's me &gt;&gt; that you're talking to. &gt;&gt; It's just not written for them. It's written for me, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I'm not reading a HISTORY BOOK. AMEN.

See, some sometimes people can't love God because they ain't they don't see God. But sometimes I you have to believe that Jesus died for your sins, shed his precious blood, that he he's forgiven you of all your sins, all your trespasses, and all you have to do is receive him as your personal savior. It's an individual thing. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And if you believe, you will see. Not if you see, you believe. He says, "And whom though now ye see him not." Amen. Yet what? &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Yet believing you what? &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; That's what the trouble is. People ain't rejoicing. &gt;&gt; All right. Why they ain't rejoicing? Cuz they don't believe. &gt;&gt; They come with their head down. They go back with their head down because they don't believe. But if you truly believe, you can what? &gt;&gt; You can rejoice. Not only did he leave it, he said, "Rejoice with what? &gt;&gt; You You never been filled up with joy unspeakable."

WHY WE OUGHT TO BE praising the Lord. The devil have our minds wondering whether or not GOD CARE, WHETHER OR NOT HE LOVED ME. HE ALREADY PROVED THAT. &gt;&gt; I SAID HE ALREADY GOT ENOUGH FOR US. HE ALREADY SHOWED US HOW MUCH YOU CARE. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm taking my patent back &gt;&gt; for Minister Lee Get. He's done. If he ain't done enough, he already done enough.

You don't have to do nothing else. &gt;&gt; He's already done enough. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, by the grace of God, I know we got to go on, but I I know you got to go home, but let me I maybe I won't read these scriptures, but let me talk to you for a minute. The trial of your faith is much more precious than gold, though it be tried with fire. I want to say by faith Abraham when he was tried, praise God, when he was tested, he was able to offer up Isaac, the son that was given to him. When he he received him as though he and Sarah was dead, he said to Isaac, "God, if I kill you, I know God is able to raise you up from the dead." Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So God tested him, but he had to go all the way and ra the knife before God said, "Wait a minute. WAIT A MINUTE. PRAISE GOD. I don't know how far you have to go, &gt;&gt; but if you hold to God's unchanging hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; And he will provide. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He'll vi &gt;&gt; if he have to. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Materialize a lamb ON THE SIDE. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL WORK THINGS OUT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL DO IT FOR YOU. PRAISE GOD. IF YOU have to bring your husband from the North Pole, &gt;&gt; Praise God. He'll work it out for you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say, I don't see nobody. He didn't say what. &gt;&gt; See, he said, believe. &gt;&gt; If you pray, BELIEVE &gt;&gt; THAT MY GOD IS MORE THAN ABLE. YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I don't see nobody. Well, you're just looking &gt;&gt; instead of believing. &gt;&gt; You're trying to see. He didn't say see. HE SAID BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; SAY GOD, YOU GOD. &gt;&gt; YES, HE IS. &gt;&gt; You gave mama a husband. &gt;&gt; You gave sister so and so. Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT ME? &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET, don't pass me by. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Ain't God good? &gt;&gt; Now you got the city bleed or you going to believe anyhow? &gt;&gt; I got to get off of that. That's corner. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; But uh where now Abraham was tested and he was tried but he passed the test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you passing the test? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you willing to please God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He passed the test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe I do this on my conclusion. &gt;&gt; I skip over all the other things. How their faith was tried. Y'all know about Daniel's faith being tried. It may seem repetitious, but his faith was tried. &gt;&gt; It was tested. He was sold to the lions, but he was tested. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; But he passed the test. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego, they what? &gt;&gt; They passed the test. &gt;&gt; Okay, look at somebody say, "Are you passing your test?" &gt;&gt; Are you passing your test? Or should we put a F up there? Flunk. Flock are incomplete. Incomplete. I don't know. I'm in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I don't know which way I'm going. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Are you going to speak FAITH AND SAY I PASSED THE TEST? &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm not going to wait till it's over. Amen. I'MMA PRAISE GOD NOW. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. DON'T WAIT TILL THE BATTLE IS OVER. SHOUT NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I said I was going to do this last scripture, but I already said that was the last one, &gt;&gt; but let me just I'll quit. Save it to T I mean, no f Friday or whatever. as if I do all the preaching for a while. But by the grace of God, I thank God for you. &gt;&gt; I keep going and my time I try to let y'all out cuz I don't know where some of y'all at. Some of y'all got to go at a certain time, but some of y'all don't mind staying all day and night. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Ain't God good? Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I don't want God to put a failing grade, that I wasn't able to go through my time, my test, that I didn't come out victorious, that I said, "God, you made a mistake." that test they're blown. You know, you see because I because they they stronger than me. You give them that and give me theirs. &gt;&gt; God know what he doing. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us going to have our own trials and our own test. &gt;&gt; It was predestinated before the foundation of the world what we would go through. &gt;&gt; And God already know your outcome. But you got to thank God. God, you're my outcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've already given me the victory. &gt;&gt; And you got to claim it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm Oh, good. God bless you. Let us stand. Amen. Sometimes sometime people say, "Well, if you holling and screaming, I can't understand you. Will you slow down and you talk? I can understand you clear. Amen.

You know, last night I was looking over at it was Matthew 8 and how that centurion I said he had to go all the way out of the way knowing that he was uh the captain of the people that he was going to and wasn't even uh called consider himself worthy to be in their presence. But I said he had to go all the way out of the way, right? Because no doubt I say faith cometh by hearing. No doubt he heard the miracles that Jesus was working and he got in desperation. I was preaching to myself last night. I says, "But he says, "You don't have to come to my house. Just speak the word only." And Jesus uh saying he he looked at those he says, "I ain't found no greater faith." I can see him looking at the centurion saying, "This is where I'm trying to get y'all at right here. The faith that he got, this is where I'm trying to get y'all to." But you know what he says? Go thy way and as thou has believed it'll be done. Hallelujah. Oh Jesus. He says speak. Go. Come on. You ain't got to go to my just go thy way. He said as you believe it'll be done just like you said. And I was rejoicing last night just looking over the scriptures and I said, "God, that's what it is. Come on. You got to believe." He says, "Why? Why you marveling?" He says, "Speak the word. It'll be as you say." Come on. But do you believe this morning? Hallelujah. How many appreciate the word this morning? His presence. God is good. Amen. I I really enjoyed the word. Amen. I was a little frustrated the other night. Wasn't able to make it to church, but I was looking at it online after service is over with. I was telling uh telling them I says, "Man, if somebody come behind you, they might be a drop off." I said, "You the Lord got you going." I says we we got to keep going up. Amen. Because we all enjoying the word of God. Amen. For the season. How many believe it's a word for the season? Amen. I thank God this morning. Now, you can't doubt now. When you leave out of here, don't doubt it. No negative. We all speaking positive, right? Come on. God is good. Amen. Let us bow our heads this morning. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your grace today, Lord. Thank you for your mercy, Lord. God, the word that was preached, oh God, I know that, Lord, your word is a seed and I know that it reached the heart. So God, I pray, Lord, this the morning, Lord, that, oh God, that the word had fallen on good ground. And Lord, let it bring forth, oh God. May there be an explosion of faith, oh God. People believing you at your word, oh God, and signs and wonders following them that believe. God, we thank you. Continue, Lord, blessing the ministry, Lord. Continue, oh God, strengthening your people. Go with us now. Bless us in a mighty way, Lord, as we depart this place, but never your presence. Go with us. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
