[41:48] through a dark hour amen
[41:50] you know the world is so dark
[41:53] it's getting darker by the day ain't it
[41:56] but I like how the scripture says that
[41:58] the Good Shepherd he know all his sheep
[42:01] and he called them by name right
[42:03] and it says that you know he'll lead him
[42:06] out
[42:07] you know he won't let him go out on
[42:09] their own but the Good Shepherd standing
[42:11] at the door waiting on the sheep know
[42:13] him all by name
[42:15] I thank God for that that he knows me by
[42:18] name
[42:19] he knows before I was even born before I
[42:22] even come into the world God already
[42:23] knew you
[42:24] and he already knew the decisions you'd
[42:26] make
[42:27] so you know he looked over those things
[42:29] didn't he as I was saying the other
[42:31] night he loved me in spite of
[42:33] all of my wrong and I thank God for that
[42:36] don't you thank God for that this
[42:37] morning
[42:38] you know many of us wouldn't be here
[42:40] today we we didn't have a right to be
[42:42] here today
[42:43] because of the life that we lived it was
[42:45] so many that seemed to be somewhat
[42:48] better that should have been in your
[42:49] place right when man looks at it from
[42:52] the outward appearance but I'm so glad
[42:55] that God through predestination saw me
[42:58] and he looked beyond all my faults
[43:01] all of my wrongdoings all of that God
[43:05] bypassed all of that
[43:07] because he knew that when he went to
[43:08] Calvary and shed his blood
[43:10] that that was going to be enough
[43:12] said don't worry about it my blood will
[43:14] take care of that
[43:16] my blood covered all you got to do is
[43:18] come to me and he shared that with
[43:20] people all the time you know no matter
[43:23] the wrong that you've done God has
[43:26] already taken care of that he already
[43:28] made provision of that all you got to do

[47:22] because God is so good
[47:24] Mark 5 and 24.
[47:30] by the grace of God
[47:31] we want to continue on from a message we
[47:34] started last week
[47:35] Matt Mark 5 and 24 if you got to say
[47:38] Amen
[47:39] and it reads and Jesus went with him and
[47:43] much people followed him and thrown him
[47:45] and a certain woman which had an issue
[47:48] of blood 12 years and has suffered many
[47:51] things
[47:52] of many Physicians and had spent all
[47:55] that she had and was nothing better but
[47:58] rather grew worse when she had heard of
[48:01] Jesus
[48:02] come in the press behind and touch His
[48:07] Garment for she said if I may touch but
[48:11] his clothes I shall be made whole and
[48:14] straight away the Fountain of her blood
[48:16] was dried up and she felt in her body
[48:19] that she was healed of her plague I
[48:23] believe so Yvonne said God can instantly
[48:25] do it right like I said she felt it in
[48:28] her body right right away didn't she
[48:30] that God the Healer of that plague and
[48:33] Jesus immediately knowing in himself
[48:35] that virtue had gone out of him turned
[48:38] him about in the press and said who
[48:41] touched my clothes and his disciples
[48:44] said unto him thou see is the most too
[48:45] strongly and says Thou who touched me
[48:48] and he looked round about to see her
[48:52] that had done this thing but when a
[48:54] woman feared and trembling knowing what
[48:55] was done in her came and fell down
[48:58] before him and told him all the truth
[49:01] and he said unto her her daughter thy
[49:04] faith have made thee whole go in peace
[49:07] and be whole of thy plague may God is a
[49:11] blessing to the reading of his words you
[49:12] may be seated this morning
[49:14] this morning by God's grace we want to
[49:16] continue on on something we started on
[49:17] last week thy faith has saved thee amen
[49:21] thy faith has have saved thee you know
[49:25] he told this woman here thy faith have
[49:27] made thee whole but many many places in
[49:30] the scripture we can look and see that
[49:33] you know when God something happened
[49:35] amongst the people or healing took place
[49:37] or whatever might have happened a lot of
[49:39] times Jesus told them he said thy faith
[49:42] may be whole or thy faith has saved me
[49:45] your faith done that come on so I says
[49:48] that a lot of times as we were saying
[49:51] even on last week and I'll say that even
[49:53] here this morning like our sister
[49:55] Yvonne's testimony her faith done that
[49:57] right the sister brother Jackson your
[50:00] faith done that a lot of times you know
[50:03] sometimes we look for certain great
[50:05] things and all these other things but
[50:07] God is looking for your faith he says
[50:10] where is your faith this morning
[50:11] sometimes we like I said we look for the
[50:13] mighty things I remember it was naming
[50:15] her whoever in the Bible when he wanted
[50:18] to be healed from leprosy and they told
[50:20] him to go out there and and dip in the
[50:22] money the Jordan I believe it was seven
[50:24] times and he said well I thought he was
[50:26] going to come out and do some great
[50:27] thing didn't he he says but he all these
[50:30] other places and he tells me to go out
[50:32] there but what it was God was looking
[50:34] for Faith wasn't he so you know he
[50:37] wanted to see what his faith was so I
[50:39] asked you this morning where is your
[50:41] faith because your faith will save you
[50:43] this morning your faith to heal you
[50:45] whatever you need don't you know that
[50:47] faith has the ability to give it to you
[50:49] this morning and a lot of times you know
[50:52] I I says that you know if you can figure
[50:54] it out then that ain't faith come on
[50:57] faith you can't fit if you when you
[50:58] can't figure it out and it comes to pass
[51:00] that's Faith but when you can figure it
[51:03] out and pinpoint how it came to pass
[51:06] [Music]
[51:12] you know he says before any man could
[51:15] come to him he got to First believe that
[51:18] he what that he is God come on so you
[51:21] know and we know that the Bible also
[51:23] says faith comes by what hearing right
[51:26] and hearing the word you know I like how
[51:29] the Bible says that this woman here she
[51:32] had uh uh had this issue so long you
[51:36] know dealing with it in her body and she
[51:38] went to the um all the physicians in the
[51:41] Bible says and she suffered many things
[51:43] come on other positions don't you know
[51:46] sometimes you go to these doctors and
[51:48] I'm not speaking against uh medical and
[51:51] all that because you know we thank God
[51:53] for it amen but sometimes they trying
[51:56] things on you come on trying experiments
[51:59] right make yourself a more than than
[52:01] what it was from the beginning y'all
[52:03] agree with that this morning come on now
[52:05] like I said but the thing is she
[52:07] suffered many things of the physician
[52:09] come on she spent all are living didn't
[52:12] she but I like how it says but the Bible
[52:14] says when she heard about Jesus
[52:17] come on faith cometh by what hearing
[52:21] she heard about Jesus she heard the
[52:24] ability that was in them she heard about
[52:27] the Miracles that he had done
[52:29] and she had she was at her ends with
[52:31] wasn't she she was at the place where
[52:34] she don't exhausted everything else
[52:37] but I heard it's a man that don't care
[52:39] about how much money I got I heard it's
[52:42] a man that don't care about the
[52:44] situation all that and if I could just
[52:46] get to him Hallelujah
[52:49] touch her come on
[52:51] that's what her faith told her didn't it
[52:54] come on we know the Bible says that
[52:56] faith without works is dead right
[52:59] so her faith made her work didn't it
[53:02] the Bible says for the Press come on
[53:05] she pressed her way through
[53:07] that crowd thrown him but she pressed
[53:11] her way through
[53:12] the pain she pressed her way through
[53:16] due to sataness and and all the letdowns
[53:19] over those 12 years she pressed her way
[53:22] through because something in her told
[53:24] her that if I can get to Jesus that he
[53:28] can do for me what everybody else
[53:30] couldn't do and that's what you try to
[53:32] convince people today you got to come to
[53:34] Jesus Hallelujah you know but before you
[53:38] come to him you got the first believe
[53:40] that he can do something for you
[53:42] that he can help you and your condition
[53:44] before you come to him Hallelujah you
[53:47] got to First believe him I was sharing
[53:49] with someone the other day and they were
[53:51] telling me about some situations and
[53:54] they called me and they said you know I
[53:56] called you because I know that I could
[53:59] talk to you and you know I'm hurting
[54:02] real bad and it says that they told me
[54:05] that exact thing same thing they said
[54:07] I'm at my ends with
[54:09] they says that I'm at my ends within
[54:12] them I'm going through and and you know
[54:15] just talking about the terminology that
[54:18] they use they said I'm broken
[54:21] Hallelujah and I began to tell them I
[54:24] says well that's the place that God
[54:26] wants you at
[54:28] you're not exhausted all the other
[54:30] measures you at your ends with
[54:33] you Broken Hallelujah
[54:35] that's the way the master wants you at
[54:38] you guys you understand I said God
[54:40] allowed all those things to happen to
[54:43] you to get you to this place because he
[54:45] was trying to get your attention the
[54:46] whole time
[54:48] and I says that you know you can call me
[54:51] and talk to me and I'ma pray for you I
[54:54] says but that's all I can do is pray for
[54:57] you I can't help you but Jesus can help
[55:00] I said but you got to believe that he
[55:03] can help you
[55:04] because if you don't believe that he can
[55:06] help you you won't come to him you won't
[55:09] pray to him you won't call out his name
[55:12] because you don't see that he can help
[55:15] but I said when you believe you got to
[55:17] believe that God can help your situation
[55:21] you're at your ends with
[55:23] but it ain't over yet
[55:25] amen hallelujah you say heart ain't over
[55:27] yet because God is still alive
[55:30] as long as he's still alive the end
[55:32] ain't here yet
[55:33] all it takes is for him to show up
[55:36] and a new beginning to start right
[55:38] Hallelujah
[55:40] but I began to share with them that and
[55:42] I said that's what we try to do all the
[55:44] time is convince people you got to come
[55:47] to Jesus come on
[55:49] you running in circles trying to repair
[55:52] it and Patch It Yourself
[55:54] Hallelujah but a lot a lot of times the
[55:57] Lord is sitting back watching he'll
[55:59] allow you to do that too run and run
[56:01] around in circles trying to repair it
[56:02] trying to patch it don't get no better
[56:04] come on but when you come to your ends
[56:07] with
[56:08] when you come to that place you say Lord
[56:10] I'm broken I said just like how you told
[56:12] me you broken I say get down on your
[56:14] knees and say Lord I'm broken God I'm at
[56:17] my ends with Lord I need your help I
[56:20] said and watch what God do I say God
[56:22] been waiting on you the whole time to
[56:24] call on his name that's what he been
[56:26] doing waiting on
[56:28] to call him
[56:29] Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[56:32] and forever
[56:34] and they begin talking to me they said I
[56:36] know you and I know what God did for you
[56:39] I said if God did it for me there's no
[56:41] respect the person God will do it for
[56:43] you
[56:44] Hallelujah only thing it was is that I
[56:47] heard the voice and I came to him just
[56:50] like I was Hallelujah
[56:54] I like that little song I Came To Jesus
[56:57] just like I was amen weary Hallelujah
[57:00] wounded and sad come on a lot of people
[57:03] wounded this morning come on they warned
[57:07] it because of things happened to him in
[57:09] their life
[57:10] happy to them got them thrown off you
[57:13] know the Bible said that a wounded
[57:15] spirit is hard to bear come on if it's
[57:18] broken sometimes it's easy to repair
[57:19] that but a wound is hard but we serve a
[57:23] God that heal wounds
[57:25] we serve a God that men those broken
[57:28] pieces Hallelujah what he'll do carry
[57:32] you back to that place the way you've
[57:34] been wounded
[57:35] carry you back to that place sometime in
[57:38] your mind where the devil has your
[57:40] captive and got you bound the way you
[57:43] can't serve the Living God
[57:45] he'll tell you back to that place
[57:47] and he'll help you to deal with it
[57:50] Hallelujah I don't know about you but I
[57:52] say I thank God that he helped me to
[57:55] deal with my wounds help me to deal with
[57:57] my situations
[57:59] Hallelujah that I can be free to serve
[58:01] the Living God how many want to be free
[58:03] this morning come on but what I say is
[58:06] before you come to God you got to First
[58:07] believe it right you got to First
[58:09] believe that he is you know I said thy
[58:11] faith has saved thee come on faith
[58:14] that's what it is it's a lot of times we
[58:16] get away from that because everything
[58:18] today is so accessible ain't it so
[58:21] accessible but what is faith we talk
[58:24] about uh those senses those five senses
[58:26] as we're saying here tasty smell all
[58:30] those things that we contact this Rim
[58:32] but you know faith is a sixth sense
[58:34] faith is that sense that that supersedes
[58:38] all those other sins
[58:39] come on what your eyes tell you telling
[58:43] you showing you Faith supersedes what
[58:45] your eyes showing you because your eyes
[58:47] come on assure you you know anything
[58:49] that's going against what the word of
[58:51] God said Is A Lie come on well your eyes
[58:54] will show you things but what did the
[58:56] word say about it hallelujah hallelujah
[58:58] what did the word say about it yo yo yo
[59:01] your touch uh I'll tell you something
[59:03] but what the word say about it your body
[59:05] or how you feel in pain but what did
[59:07] God's word say about it Hallelujah the
[59:10] sense of Faith reaches out to those
[59:12] things don't it reaches out to the
[59:15] things that the census can't can't uh
[59:17] have don't have knowledge of the Bible
[59:20] says that we know that by faith the
[59:22] world's Afraid come on by the word of
[59:25] God and by it the elders obtain a good
[59:28] report didn't they because they believe
[59:30] that all these things we see
[59:33] are a product of what God spoke and if
[59:37] God spoke these things into existence
[59:39] what can't God do today
[59:41] Speak Lord I want to hear your voice
[59:44] Speak Lord I want to hear your word come
[59:47] on because it's still power in the voice
[59:49] of God Amen I believe God speak in the
[59:53] mountain sheet come on you're Tremble
[59:55] When God speaks Hallelujah I ain't
[59:58] talking about with man's speaking but
[1:00:00] when God speak right come on but thy
[1:00:04] faith has saved me come on not your
[1:00:06] money come on not your feeling but your
[1:00:09] face age
[1:00:10] like so I can say so many times in the
[1:00:12] scriptures he told your faith made you
[1:00:14] whole come on be it as what you say come
[1:00:17] on I didn't find so great of Faith no
[1:00:19] not at all Israel this man go ahead just
[1:00:22] as you say come on just that why because
[1:00:25] God was trying to show the people
[1:00:27] hallelujah that the world belongs to you
[1:00:30] come on everything in it belongs to you
[1:00:33] got to have faith whatever you say he
[1:00:36] said why are you marveling when you see
[1:00:38] this tree weathered away come on Jesus
[1:00:41] didn't have to get a shovel and dig the
[1:00:43] tree up come on a poison it and make it
[1:00:46] die but when he spoke to the tree
[1:00:49] Hallelujah the next day it was weather
[1:00:51] they was marvelous right
[1:00:54] but he said why are you Marvel
[1:00:56] he said the same power you see in me you
[1:00:59] didn't have that same power if you
[1:01:01] believe all you got to do is have faith
[1:01:03] come on it'll be as you say I said God
[1:01:07] help us to get to that place oh Jesus I
[1:01:11] don't know about you but there's so many
[1:01:13] that's in need this morning so many that
[1:01:16] need a real God
[1:01:17] Hallelujah need more than just playing
[1:01:21] Church clapping hands and singing won't
[1:01:24] work Hallelujah just hearing A good
[1:01:26] sermon won't work Hallelujah but we need
[1:01:29] Faith to bring life to the word
[1:01:30] hallelujah
[1:01:32] oh Jesus come on
[1:01:34] we got real situations don't you got
[1:01:36] real situations come on and like I said
[1:01:39] what it is Faith you know Faith
[1:01:41] supersedes all those other senses
[1:01:44] because when the other senses failure
[1:01:46] Faith still says I know it's still
[1:01:49] possible come on God still bring it to
[1:01:52] pass you know what we said last week
[1:01:54] that that hope is the greatest enemy of
[1:01:57] Faith right
[1:01:58] because hope hope says that I know God
[1:02:02] can do it but my body's still hurting
[1:02:04] and the doctor said this so I hope he'll
[1:02:06] do it but but you know but Faith doesn't
[1:02:09] look at that what faith says is it ain't
[1:02:12] even looking at the doctor's report it
[1:02:15] ain't even looking at how my body feels
[1:02:16] Faith said that I am healed with his
[1:02:20] stripes that's what faith says
[1:02:22] hallelujah
[1:02:23] hope is looking for something I'm hoping
[1:02:26] that God will do it one day Hallelujah
[1:02:29] amen but faith says it's already now
[1:02:32] I am overcoming I am a deliverer I am
[1:02:36] healed right now that's what faith says
[1:02:38] hallelujah come on but what it is why
[1:02:42] because it supersedes all those things
[1:02:44] it supersedes all of the um the other uh
[1:02:49] senses doesn't it come on and that's
[1:02:51] what Jesus uh wants us to
[1:02:55] to reach out to come on that's what
[1:02:57] that's what he's touched by it wasn't
[1:02:59] just a natural Touch of this woman come
[1:03:03] on but it was her faith that reached out
[1:03:05] and that's why you know the disciples
[1:03:08] saying Master there's so many that's
[1:03:10] touching you what what you talking about
[1:03:11] all these people touching you but if you

[1:03:51] on I've been there have you been there
[1:03:53] this morning come on let's look at one
[1:03:55] scripture Romans
[1:03:57] Romans 4 by the grace of God thy faith
[1:04:00] has saved thee come on
[1:04:04] I says you know
[1:04:07] faith is something
[1:04:12] faith is something that that gets us
[1:04:14] through
[1:04:15] donut
[1:04:17] faith faith is is a beautiful thing once
[1:04:21] we grab a hold to it
[1:04:22] come on because you come like with like
[1:04:25] somebody told me you come to your ends
[1:04:27] with
[1:04:28] you get to those situations where you
[1:04:30] just don't know what to do
[1:04:33] you get to that point in life itself
[1:04:36] where everything else you don't know
[1:04:38] where where to turn from here come on
[1:04:41] and what do you do when you get to that
[1:04:43] point
[1:04:44] you know a lot of times people don't
[1:04:46] look up
[1:04:47] because they never been instructed to
[1:04:49] come on but when you give them that
[1:04:52] option Hallelujah come on that's why you
[1:04:54] got to tell somebody about Jesus maybe
[1:04:57] nobody told him about Jesus in the right
[1:04:59] way come on but when you begin to tell
[1:05:02] them about Jesus it gives them something
[1:05:04] to look to
[1:05:05] it gives them something something in
[1:05:08] their spirit that they can say look uh I
[1:05:10] heard about you I heard about it God
[1:05:13] help me I ain't worthy of the least of
[1:05:16] thy mercies Hallelujah you ever been
[1:05:18] there I ain't worthy of it but God I
[1:05:20] need your help Hallelujah thy faith has
[1:05:23] saved me Romans 4 and 18 by the grace of
[1:05:26] God
[1:05:28] you got it say man
[1:05:30] and it reads
[1:05:32] we're talking about Abraham here in
[1:05:34] history Journey come on we're saying
[1:05:36] that faith has saved thee
[1:05:38] who against hope believed in hope that
[1:05:42] he might become the father of many
[1:05:44] nations according to that which was
[1:05:47] spoken so shall thy seed be and be and
[1:05:50] not weak and what
[1:05:52] Faith he considered not his own dead
[1:05:54] body now dead when he was about a
[1:05:58] hundred years old neither yet the
[1:06:01] deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered
[1:06:04] not at the promise of God through
[1:06:07] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[1:06:10] glory to God being fully persuaded that
[1:06:14] what he had promised he was also able to
[1:06:17] perform and therefore it was imputed to
[1:06:20] him for righteousness come on we send
[1:06:23] thy faith has saved thee says that's
[1:06:25] what God is requiring you know you talk
[1:06:27] about faith you know looking at Abraham
[1:06:30] being the father of Faith come on one
[1:06:33] you know I say is that God you know God
[1:06:36] called him out didn't he call him out he
[1:06:38] never in the land of his people but yet
[1:06:41] it was something about Abraham he didn't
[1:06:44] know who this God was he didn't know
[1:06:46] where this land was that it was leading
[1:06:48] them to but by faith he chose to get up
[1:06:51] from out of his country but you didn't
[1:06:52] come on by faith thy faith has safety
[1:06:56] Abraham didn't let nothing shake his
[1:06:58] faith now we know that even in all all
[1:07:01] those things I says that his whole his
[1:07:04] whole journey was a was a built not was
[1:07:07] built now Faith his whole journey was
[1:07:09] built by faith
[1:07:10] come on going out everything that he
[1:07:14] obtained he obtained it through faith
[1:07:16] didn't he
[1:07:17] every move that he made he had to have
[1:07:19] faith behind that move that he made
[1:07:21] because God wasn't going to show it all
[1:07:23] to him right at once but he just said I
[1:07:25] want you to go here I want you to move I
[1:07:27] want you to do this right here and I'm
[1:07:28] gonna bless you come on so by faith
[1:07:31] Abraham got up and moved come on left
[1:07:34] the left is country you don't want to go
[1:07:36] don't handle me come on but I believe
[1:07:39] that the god that called me is able to
[1:07:42] perform those things come on so by faith
[1:07:45] he got up and moved didn't he and that's
[1:07:48] what God wants today A Child by faith
[1:07:51] that a get up move
[1:07:52] then everybody else around you sitting
[1:07:55] around you they ain't hearing that voice
[1:07:56] but when he call you out I want you to
[1:07:59] get up move come on everybody else is
[1:08:01] saying this and that but by faith get up
[1:08:04] move I'ma bless you come on let me see
[1:08:07] your Works come on I ain't gonna show it
[1:08:10] to you I'm just telling you I'm gonna
[1:08:11] bless you
[1:08:12] come on
[1:08:13] he got up moved but even after that when
[1:08:16] he went to that land he made it to the
[1:08:18] land of Canaan oh it was just as the
[1:08:22] Lord had told him it was going to be but
[1:08:24] it wasn't long after he got in that land
[1:08:26] that you know a drought came didn't it
[1:08:29] come on a drought came not long after he
[1:08:32] got in the land but did that shake his
[1:08:35] faith no it didn't shake his faith did
[1:08:37] it sometimes God allowed those things to
[1:08:40] happen to try you come on he bring you
[1:08:43] out you say it by faith God I came out
[1:08:45] Lord I did what you said you got that
[1:08:48] season where God is blessing you
[1:08:50] Hallelujah but what about in the season
[1:08:52] when the drought has come
[1:08:55] what about in the season when you're
[1:08:57] praying it don't look like you're gonna
[1:08:58] get an answer
[1:08:59] what about in the season when the dogs
[1:09:02] are shut in your face I said where is
[1:09:04] your faith then
[1:09:06] Hallelujah
[1:09:07] we all have no Seasons trials don't you
[1:09:11] know many turn back middle curse their
[1:09:13] God and die in those situations but
[1:09:16] Abraham wouldn't like that Hallelujah
[1:09:19] Abraham knew Hallelujah that I left my
[1:09:22] father's house
[1:09:24] I left everything
[1:09:25] I ain't got nothing else but you God
[1:09:28] Hallelujah I got no other choice but to
[1:09:32] trust you now
[1:09:33] I don't got nothing else Lord so why
[1:09:36] should I allow my faith to fail I ain't
[1:09:38] got nothing else to look to Hallelujah
[1:09:40] so I'm gonna keep looking at him I don't
[1:09:43] know about you but that's the way I feel
[1:09:45] amen hallelujah when I came to the Lord
[1:09:48] he separates it from everything times do
[1:09:51] get hard
[1:09:52] times get tough
[1:09:54] sometimes seem like God ain't giving you
[1:09:57] an answer that you want Hallelujah
[1:09:59] but I ain't got nowhere else to go I
[1:10:02] ain't got nowhere else to turn to
[1:10:03] Hallelujah I don't have everything else
[1:10:05] behind
[1:10:07] I can't let my face fail Hallelujah come
[1:10:10] on
[1:10:11] you know and that's what happens don't
[1:10:13] it
[1:10:14] faith
[1:10:16] he didn't let his faith fell him did he
[1:10:18] come on even in those times he kept the
[1:10:21] faith didn't he come on I said you hold
[1:10:23] it out are you keeping the faith but in
[1:10:27] that he he left that he did that you
[1:10:28] know he went to so many things went
[1:10:31] through so many things and uh and God
[1:10:34] called him out went through so many
[1:10:35] things but you know I like how the Bible
[1:10:37] says because we know that he had trials
[1:10:40] out there in the desert out there in the
[1:10:42] wilderness you know from other people
[1:10:44] and going into other lands and had all
[1:10:46] these battles his nephew got kidnapped
[1:10:49] and all these things had to fight all
[1:10:50] these Kings had trial at the trial
[1:10:52] situation that's a situation and still
[1:10:55] yet didn't have the promise seed still
[1:10:57] yet didn't have the greatest promise
[1:10:59] that God had promised him but the Bible
[1:11:01] says that he didn't stagger at the
[1:11:03] promise of God
[1:11:04] through unbelief come on but he grew
[1:11:07] strong in faith giving glory to God kept
[1:11:11] confessing right that God is able to
[1:11:14] perform it I can't listen to the cloud
[1:11:16] crowd of noise around me I can't
[1:11:19] consider my own body Hallelujah like we
[1:11:22] said faith is the sixth sin he could
[1:11:24] consider his body his body telling him
[1:11:27] you owe you dried up
[1:11:29] come on you Dad
[1:11:32] and the promise ain't came yet but that
[1:11:35] sense of Faith superseded that didn't it
[1:11:38] it went beyond what his body told him
[1:11:40] getting up in the morning maybe
[1:11:43] arthritis bones hurting Hallelujah ain't
[1:11:46] got a child yet but his faith superseded
[1:11:50] that I can't look at those things or
[1:11:53] what my body is telling me
[1:11:55] but I'm looking to the promise of God
[1:11:57] and what God Said in this word I believe
[1:12:00] you Lord though my body is yet dead I
[1:12:04] believe you God that one day you'll do
[1:12:07] something Hallelujah
[1:12:09] oh Jesus
[1:12:11] he kept walking didn't he come on but
[1:12:14] that's what that sense of Faith did
[1:12:16] superseded that what I'm saying this
[1:12:19] morning come on I don't know where
[1:12:21] you're sitting at what situation you're
[1:12:23] in but when faith when you turn your
[1:12:25] faith loose Hallelujah
[1:12:28] it'll supersede all that what you're
[1:12:30] going through
[1:12:31] I told someone the other day I said what
[1:12:34] the devil's doing he want to get you to
[1:12:36] that place he gonna twist your mind all
[1:12:38] up
[1:12:38] he getting you in that dark room he
[1:12:41] gonna twist your mind all up and he
[1:12:43] gonna destroy you come on that's what
[1:12:46] the devil will do don't he I said but

[1:12:51] amen the devil is warning you yet the
[1:12:53] devil warn you God is calling you the
[1:12:56] devil wants you to come so he can bind

[1:15:04] how we heard so many times the devil's
[1:15:07] saying it's over with
[1:15:09] Hallelujah where's your God now
[1:15:13] but yet we held out Hallelujah we kept
[1:15:16] the faith

[1:16:56] hold on to it Hallelujah the doctors I'm
[1:16:59] told you no didn't he the doctor's son
[1:17:01] gave you a bad report you ain't got
[1:17:03] nothing else
[1:17:04] but Faith hallelujah what to hold on to
[1:17:07] it and supersede that's what it is
[1:17:10] I said you know Abraham I want to I want
[1:17:12] to read something here out of the
[1:17:14] Amplified Bible I said thy faith has
[1:17:17] saved thee you know looking back over
[1:17:19] Abraham's life
[1:17:21] and all of his you know I've been doing
[1:17:23] some studying on on his life and all of
[1:17:26] his this week in the past two weeks but
[1:17:29] all his going through his life and his
[1:17:32] whole journey was built off Faith coming
[1:17:34] out calling God calling even after he
[1:17:37] had the son God said I want you to give
[1:17:39] him up
[1:17:40] didn't he 'd go up there but I says that
[1:17:43] Abraham's Faith Abraham's Faith even
[1:17:45] when Isaac asked him he says he says uh
[1:17:49] father I see the fire in the wood but
[1:17:51] where is the burnt offer
[1:17:52] Abraham's Faith was he said the Lord
[1:17:55] will provide himself one
[1:17:57] come on Abraham knew that yeah God gave
[1:18:00] me this son as a it was a miracle God
[1:18:03] gave him to me if he asked for him back
[1:18:05] I'll give it back to him because I know
[1:18:06] God can raise him back up
[1:18:08] that's what my faith is saying that God
[1:18:10] can do all things come on I believe God
[1:18:13] asked Abraham once is there anything too
[1:18:15] hard for the Lord come on and I asked
[1:18:18] you that question this morning I know
[1:18:19] you got situations and Trials come on I
[1:18:22] know you're faced with mountains but is
[1:18:24] there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:18:25] come on what can't God do I was looking
[1:18:29] at the the news the other day and
[1:18:31] there's talking about the the national
[1:18:32] uh uh deficit or whatever and the debt
[1:18:36] the national debt and how it is to the
[1:18:39] ceiling now and how you know uh and what
[1:18:41] it what does that mean and all that does
[1:18:44] everybody know America busted come on
[1:18:46] money don't mean nothing does it
[1:18:49] come on it's just like they call it a
[1:18:51] promissory note but they ain't got the
[1:18:52] gold to back it up come on they give you
[1:18:55] money to spend but they ain't got the
[1:18:57] gold to back it up
[1:18:58] but God gives you his word and he got
[1:19:00] the power to back it up don't he come on
[1:19:02] God God don't give you nothing that he
[1:19:05] came back up
[1:19:06] it means something that that word never
[1:19:08] loses his value come on you said never
[1:19:11] know it never loses it value matter of
[1:19:13] fact the more time go on the more value
[1:19:15] it becomes because we in that time now
[1:19:18] where the word of God is precious
[1:19:21] Hallelujah I almost says it was in the
[1:19:24] days of Samuel I believe it was and the
[1:19:25] lamp went out come on it wasn't no open
[1:19:28] Vision the word of God was precious in
[1:19:30] those days and the word of God is
[1:19:33] precious today when everybody's taking
[1:19:35] their own thoughts so even the the
[1:19:37] sexuality of men and women doing all
[1:19:40] these things turning upside down come on
[1:19:42] and they want to kick against the word
[1:19:44] of God the word of God is precious
[1:19:46] Hallelujah
[1:19:48] and just as it was able to save in the
[1:19:51] old days it's able to save now just as
[1:19:53] it was able to heal in the old days it's
[1:19:55] able to heal now it's still able to keep
[1:19:58] now it's still got power in it come on
[1:20:00] no matter what the world is saying about
[1:20:03] it they can't see it but you and I see
[1:20:06] it Through The Eyes of Faith Hallelujah
[1:20:09] you know I was studying up on like I
[1:20:11] said Abraham and looking at how you know
[1:20:14] some of the uh they don't say he'd be
[1:20:16] the father of many nations right
[1:20:18] and how I was looking at some of the
[1:20:20] Nations that he followed and then you
[1:20:23] know but many times the archaeologists
[1:20:25] scientists and all that said that this
[1:20:27] can't be proven they even talked about
[1:20:29] Abraham and saying the Torah wouldn't
[1:20:32] tell after the the um Persian Empire let
[1:20:35] the Egyptian I mean the Israelites go
[1:20:38] back the Jews go back to their Homeland
[1:20:40] that's after that's when the Torah was
[1:20:41] written so they can't even confirm they
[1:20:43] said and that was only written because
[1:20:45] two two different groups of people were
[1:20:47] fighting over the land so one of them
[1:20:49] wrote it to say that we got inheritance
[1:20:52] to this land because this is our father
[1:20:53] so they said that it can't even be
[1:20:55] proven come on so they looking so
[1:20:57] they're saying that this is just pretty
[1:20:59] much Theory this is just what they
[1:21:01] saying this is just their beliefs and
[1:21:03] all that right come on but I say is the
[1:21:06] thing is by the by you looking to find
[1:21:09] historical facts and all these things
[1:21:10] factual you'll never see it come on
[1:21:13] you'll never see God looking for him
[1:21:16] that way
[1:21:17] because God is contacted by faith
[1:21:20] you'll never you'll never be able to
[1:21:22] prove it like that if you can and that
[1:21:24] ain't Faith come on
[1:21:25] Hallelujah but you and I why they
[1:21:28] spending all this money all this
[1:21:29] research going back doing all this right
[1:21:31] here you and I don't have to do all that
[1:21:33] come on because God has already revealed
[1:21:35] it to us come on and by faith we see it
[1:21:38] and by faith we enjoy the blessings of
[1:21:41] it to do away with Abraham is to do away
[1:21:43] with the blessings of his seed right
[1:21:46] because God made a promise to Abraham
[1:21:48] didn't he
[1:21:49] they did not see come on shall all the
[1:21:52] nations of the earth be blessed and then
[1:21:55] blessing are bless you come on you and I
[1:21:57] like I said to do away with that is to

[1:22:18] won't they I says that you know trying
[1:22:21] to find them that way you'll never find
[1:22:22] them

[1:24:39] and empowered by faith giving glory to
[1:24:43] God being fully convinced that God had
[1:24:47] the power to do what he promised
[1:24:49] therefore his faith was credited to him
