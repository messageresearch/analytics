[34:40] give God a hand clap of Praise this is
[34:42] Thanksgiving week you know this is just
[34:45] not a time to give God thanks we should
[34:47] give God thanks every day amen not just
[34:51] for the turkey we we going to eat on
[34:52] Thursday amen hey man I'm not going to
[34:55] stand before you long I want to go
[34:56] straight into the word here we start at
[34:59] uh 2 Corinthians chapter
[35:01] 12 amen I appreciate the church family
[35:05] those who were able to come out tonight
[35:07] and show up amen think I see a few of
[35:10] them out there amen amen appreciate
[35:13] Pastor Simmons he was back there in the
[35:15] in the back just filling me up with some
[35:17] good old
[35:18] wisdom I need to spend a whole day with
[35:21] him amen I really appreciate him and God
[35:24] using him I was telling him he's a he's
[35:25] a pillar in in the message man and I I
[35:27] have a lot of respect for him and his
[35:30] ministry and what he's the vision that
[35:32] God has given him for his people amen
[35:35] man second Corinthians chapter 12 we
[35:37] start at verse one very familiar text um
[35:39] we've all seen heard before whether that
[35:42] be in Sunday school whether that be on
[35:44] Sunday morning Wednesday night but it is
[35:47] one that is still very impactful today
[35:50] so we'll start at verse one it says it
[35:52] is it is not expedient for me doubtless
[35:55] to Glory I would come to visions and
[35:57] revelation ations of the Lord verse two
[35:59] I knew a man in Christ above 14 years
[36:02] ago whether in the body I cannot tell or
[36:05] whether they out of the body I cannot
[36:07] tell God knoweth such and one caught up
[36:10] to the third heaven verse three and I
[36:12] knew such a man whether in the body or
[36:14] out of the body I cannot tell God
[36:16] knoweth Paul is completely clueless as
[36:18] to what's going on he's been to a place
[36:20] and he can't even talk about what he's
[36:22] seen okay verse four says how that he
[36:25] was caught up into paradise and heard
[36:27] unspeakable Words which is not lawful
[36:29] for for a man to utter verse 5 of such
[36:33] an one will I Glory yet of myself I
[36:36] would not Glory but in mine what
[36:39] infirmities verse six for though I would
[36:41] desire to Glory I shall not be a what
[36:44] fool for I would say the truth but now I
[36:47] forbear lest any man should think of me
[36:50] above that which he seeth me to be or
[36:54] that he heareth of me and this is where
[36:56] I want to get my text from tonight and L
[36:58] I should be exalted above measure
[37:00] through the abundance of the revelations
[37:03] there was giving to me a thorn in the
[37:06] flesh now the key word that you got to
[37:08] take for your Victory is
[37:10] given it was given to me now you may ask
[37:13] who was it given to we going to talk
[37:15] about that on tonight amen so my topic
[37:17] tonight church is a thorn in the flesh
[37:21] let us bow Heavenly Father God lord we
[37:23] ask you tonight Lord to come down and
[37:25] move me out of the way that you may have
[37:26] your way and that you may speak a word
[37:28] Lord to encourage your people on tonight
[37:30] Lord we thank you for this opportunity
[37:32] Lord we do not take it for granted and
[37:34] treat it as a checking the box type of
[37:36] service Lord you have given us this
[37:38] opportunity you've woken us up this
[37:40] morning Lord to get better to do better
[37:42] to draw closer to you Lord and for that
[37:45] we thank you so Lord as I as I move
[37:48] myself out of the way oh God I ask you
[37:50] share a word for your people on tonight
[37:52] we ask these things in your name we pray
[37:54] amen amen amen
[37:58] so I won't be I me before you long I
[38:01] want to just kind of share a quick
[38:02] thought here and get out of get out your
[38:04] way um like I said very familiar text
[38:07] here a thorn in the flesh and to kind of
[38:09] give you some context of what is what
[38:12] Paul is talking about if you study the
[38:15] the book of Corinthians first uh
[38:17] Corinthians and 2 Corinthians the
[38:19] leaders of the Church of
[38:20] Corinth uh have been launching attacks
[38:23] on Paul's Ministry um with their goal is
[38:26] to uh uh undermine his I guess Apostolic
[38:30] Authority in the church um but Paul in
[38:33] second Corinthians he he's he he he's
[38:36] defending himself if you go back and
[38:37] start reading through it he's in a place
[38:39] to where he's trying to defend why God
[38:42] chose him why he's the you know the
[38:44] messenger for that day so he's he's in
[38:46] this chapter here and he makes his
[38:49] biggest argument in chapter 12 what we
[38:52] just read um these people they were
[38:54] coming against Paul they were boasting
[38:56] about their accomplishment ments and
[38:57] their Revelations and they claimed that
[39:00] Paul uh wasn't the real deal because he
[39:03] didn't have anything to boast
[39:06] about they were saying that he had they
[39:08] had all these dreams and Paul didn't
[39:10] have what they
[39:12] had but Paul was not an advocate of
[39:15] boasting if you go back and he says that
[39:16] in verse one uh but he breaks down uh
[39:21] now we know who Paul is today right we
[39:22] know God showed him a lot of things he
[39:24] was the first Messenger to the uh the
[39:27] Ephesian Church age but Paul here in
[39:29] chapter 12 does not go and explain all
[39:32] these visions that God has given him he
[39:36] doesn't go into detail he spends his
[39:39] time in chapter 12 explaining why he
[39:42] can't go into these visions and what God
[39:45] did to ensure that he
[39:49] didn't and this chapter stamps his
[39:52] approval with the Corinthian Church of
[39:54] who he is it wasn't him revealing this
[39:56] is what I know look what God showed me
[39:59] it was he was doing the opposite I can't
[40:01] show you these things God won't allow me
[40:03] and this is why that's right so if we go
[40:06] back to verse 7 here and lest I should
[40:08] be exalted above measure through the
[40:11] abundance of the revelations there was
[40:13] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[40:16] Greek word for thorn is scallops it is a
[40:19] a a sharp steak or splinter something
[40:24] pointed that can cause discomfort or
[40:27] pain that is driving you
[40:30] crazy come on now you think about a
[40:33] thorn you know the the
[40:36] rose is uh titled the most beautiful
[40:39] flower in the
[40:40] world but here's the thing about this
[40:43] most beautiful flower in the world you
[40:45] don't get the rose without the
[40:47] Thorns you cannot enjoy the fragrance of
[40:51] God's blessings his Joy his peace his
[40:54] understanding uh uh without getting
[40:56] pricked sometimes Times by The
[41:01] Thorns you may be thinking right now
[41:03] what are some thorns in my life I know
[41:06] every time I go back to the scripture I
[41:08] think about things in my life that I've
[41:10] been praying for God to take
[41:13] away and you get discouraged and say why
[41:16] is it still there I've been praying
[41:19] night after night to take this person
[41:22] this place this thing out of my life
[41:27] [Laughter]
[41:30] physical mental emotional doesn't matter
[41:32] what it is every believer will
[41:34] experience getting pricked oh yeah
[41:38] something that is agitating you the St
[41:41] you ever had a splinter in your hand it
[41:43] aggravates you you try to get it out you
[41:45] try needle nose you try to get a pen it
[41:47] is bothering you but you can't get it
[41:50] out so it's stuck there so Paul is going
[41:52] to tell them I got these Revelations but
[41:55] I can't reveal them and here is why I
[41:58] can't reveal them and here is how God is
[41:59] keeping me from revealing them to you
[42:02] yeah so what was this thorn of the Flesh
[42:05] in verse 7 there's a whole lot of
[42:07] different Scholars who went back and
[42:09] forth about what this particular thorn
[42:12] of the flesh was was Paul okay uh in
[42:16] Acts n some have said that this this
[42:18] Thorn was the bright light when he was
[42:20] on his way to Damascus you know he he he
[42:23] he was blinded others said he had
[42:25] glaucoma other was said that he had some
[42:28] type of physical infirmity the prophet
[42:29] of God even said that uh it was a
[42:32] disease um that Paul wanted to get
[42:34] healing for but he would get healed for
[42:36] a season and it would come back so they
[42:37] were going back somebody even said that
[42:39] it was Paul's wife that was the thorn
[42:42] just a bunch of different uh viewpoints
[42:45] and and and perspectives of what the
[42:48] thorn
[42:50] was now I I don't think it really
[42:53] matters what the thorn
[42:55] was I think
[42:57] God In His Infinite Wisdom intentionally
[43:00] made Paul not to give
[43:02] specifics of what that thorn was because
[43:05] I can go straight to this scripture and
[43:07] I can identify with it and I think we
[43:10] all can there are thorns in our life
[43:13] things in our life that we want to take
[43:16] away and sometimes we get distracted we
[43:18] don't we lose focus of why it's
[43:22] there sometimes we can get too caught on
[43:26] specifics I need to specific I need the
[43:28] Bible to tell me specifically what I'm
[43:31] supposed to do in this situation I need
[43:33] to know specifically how long my dress
[43:35] should be it should tell me specifically
[43:37] how this should be that should be if you
[43:40] needed specifics you wouldn't need the
[43:41] Holy Spirit to lead and guide
[43:44] you some things you got to seek God
[43:48] for that's what's wrong with things
[43:50] today people oh he said this this place
[43:52] and that that place that's wrong you
[43:54] need to let God the holy you got to have
[43:57] space to where you don't have the answer
[43:59] because in order for the Holy Spirit to
[44:01] lead you you can't know where you
[44:06] going Lord I need to know exactly from
[44:08] point A to point B what this entails
[44:11] what that
[44:13] entails that robs you of your experience
[44:15] you ever been with somebody who uh you
[44:18] watching a movie or reading a book and
[44:20] they trying to tell you what's happening
[44:21] next what's happening next you get upset
[44:23] not because what they're saying but
[44:25] they're robbing you of the experience
[44:29] and sometimes we want God to just tell
[44:31] us everything God said why would I do
[44:33] that and Rob you of my experience I want
[44:36] you to experience not knowing so when I
[44:37] show up you'll know it's
[44:40] me I'm not going to rob you of the
[44:42] experience because I need you to grow
[44:44] closer to me if I give you all the
[44:46] answers that's not an experience so I
[44:48] ain't going to rob you of
[44:51] that Lord I need to know why sir if I
[44:55] told you why you won't draw closer to
[44:58] me thank you Lord so the Greek word here
[45:02] for scallops is a sharp steak or
[45:04] splinter something pointed that can
[45:07] cause discomfort or pain something that
[45:10] is driving you crazy so all we need to
[45:14] know about a thorn in the flesh is that
[45:16] it don't feel good it hurts it's
[45:19] aggravating it gets on your
[45:22] nerves think about in your life right
[45:24] now people person place or thing that
[45:28] you've been praying and I know we all
[45:30] got them and if you don't got them you
[45:31] will get
[45:33] them that person that you can't stand
[45:36] but you can't get rid
[45:38] of because God is trying to teach you
[45:41] maybe brotherly kindness maybe God is
[45:44] trying to teach you
[45:48] Temperance you know it it it's funny
[45:52] because the world today the natural
[45:55] we're taught that as long as you do
[45:57] everything right right you pay your
[45:59] bills your lights stay on right you you
[46:01] you pay your bills on time your credit
[46:02] score goes up you keep gas in your car
[46:04] you can keep driving you keep the
[46:05] maintenance up so we're we're trained
[46:08] and Infused that as long as I do
[46:10] everything I'm supposed to good things
[46:12] is supposed to happen to
[46:14] me but that promise ain't in the Bible
[46:17] in this life you
[46:19] shall that's right brother Caleb he
[46:21] talked about that that peace I was
[46:23] telling brother Ernest this I think one
[46:25] of the reasons why the disciples were
[46:26] was so floored when that storm came is
[46:29] when Jesus told them get on the boat
[46:31] they did exactly what he told them to
[46:35] do in the will of God right dab smack in
[46:38] the me we did what you said Lord so we
[46:40] got to be good but when that storm hit
[46:42] they were confused Lord how is this
[46:44] happening I'm in your wheel you told us
[46:46] to get on the boat we right here why
[46:48] this storm is here it causes you to get
[46:51] confused and blindsided when you read
[46:53] the Scripture it says in this world you
[46:56] shall have tribulation what is
[46:58] tribulation Thorns Thorns
[47:02] Thorns pressure Affliction distress he
[47:05] says but be of ker because I dealt with
[47:07] the Thorns
[47:09] [Applause]
[47:11] too nobody is
[47:14] exempt you can be serving God with every
[47:17] ounce of your
[47:18] being
[47:20] 120% coming to church praying and
[47:22] reading your Bible and when the storms
[47:25] come who
[47:28] that's right why do you pay your
[47:31] insurance
[47:33] premiums it's not to stop the
[47:36] accidents it's when the accidents come
[47:38] you have
[47:41] coverage that's why you pay your
[47:43] premiums you can't stop the accidents
[47:45] but Lord if something happens to me I
[47:48] know I'm without a shadow of a doubt
[47:51] that you're covering me that's why I
[47:53] come to church that's why I pray and
[47:55] read my Bible that's why I keep pressing
[47:59] cuz when something comes up when that
[48:01] storm comes I need you to be my
[48:03] [Applause]
[48:05] shelter same logic the insurance company
[48:09] can't stop the accidents but if I
[48:10] getting one you better be ready to pay
[48:15] up nobody's exempt that's why first
[48:18] Peter tells us don't be shocked yeah
[48:21] when these fiery Trials come upon you
[48:24] don't think it as something strange it's
[48:26] part of the program amen
[48:30] amen so we can go back there 2
[48:32] Corinthians 12:7 it says unless I should
[48:34] be exalted above measure through the
[48:36] abundance of the revelations that was
[48:38] given to me a thorn in the
[48:42] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[48:46] me now there is a victory In this
[48:49] passage of scripture because in order to
[48:52] overcome you have to understand where
[48:54] the root of the problem is coming
[48:58] from Paul identifies it was a thorn and
[49:02] the devil was doing
[49:03] it it was a physical pain but Paul
[49:06] understood that the root of the problem
[49:08] or the equation it was spiritual see a
[49:11] lot of
[49:13] times we we lose track and see if you
[49:17] understand that go the church that this
[49:19] we not any a carnal battle the weapons
[49:21] of our Warfare are not carnal but they
[49:23] are what Mighty through God through the
[49:26] tearing down a stronghold so as long as
[49:28] you understand that people are not your
[49:30] problem amen you'll treat them different
[49:33] amen you won't talk to them like they
[49:35] the devil you'll realize it is Satan
[49:37] using
[49:39] them for we wrestle not against flesh
[49:43] and
[49:44] blood people ain't your problem that
[49:46] boss on your job he ain't your problem
[49:49] when you come to work and you're in a
[49:50] good mood and somebody just gets on your
[49:52] nerves take a minute and say that ain't
[49:54] nothing but the devil lord let take a
[49:57] minute and pray about this but you go to
[49:59] them like they the problem you'll find
[50:01] yourself out of the will of God now you
[50:05] got to repent right so Paul realizes
[50:09] that this problem the root of it was not
[50:12] spiritual so we have to understand when
[50:13] we when we're going against the enemy we
[50:15] have to address the root not the fruit
[50:18] you don't kill an apple tree by taking
[50:20] all the apples off the tree oh the tree
[50:21] is dead guess what going to happen next
[50:23] season them apples going to come right
[50:24] back you got to get to the root of the
[50:27] problem so when you're dealing with life
[50:29] situations figure out Lord where is this
[50:33] coming from amen is this you is it Satan
[50:36] take a few steps like a doctor you've
[50:38] been taking Tylenol for five years for a
[50:41] headache it's the bigger problem
[50:44] that talk to Dr Jesus he'll tell you
[50:47] what the problem is amen so we
[50:48] understand that Paul here has identify
[50:51] where it's coming from and he says lest
[50:55] I should be exal aled above measure
[50:58] through the abundance of Revelations
[51:00] that was given to me we talked about
[51:03] that earlier given to me a thorn of the
[51:06] flesh now who gave Paul this
[51:10] Thorn it wasn't the devil cuz he
[51:13] says lest I should be exalted above
[51:16] measure now you would think Satan will
[51:18] probably want him to be messed up in the
[51:20] will of God right cuz he understands all
[51:22] satan knows is that Pride goeth Before
[51:24] Destruction and a heart of spirit before
[51:26] fault so Satan in this situation was
[51:29] given
[51:31] permission to place and whatever the
[51:34] thorn was to come and attack Paul so
[51:37] this Thorn was given by God and he used
[51:39] Satan to do it but here's the thing the
[51:43] devil can be giving all he got but the
[51:47] whole time God is still in control
[51:50] working hard to take you out don't
[51:52] realize God is just moving and
[51:54] controlling the pieces thinkk he got you
[51:57] oh
[51:58] yeah Prophet God says this he says in
[52:00] the message possessing the enemy Gates
[52:02] he permits all these things and turns
[52:04] the devil loose to tempt you and he'll
[52:07] do all but take your life he could throw
[52:10] you on a bed of Affliction he could turn
[52:12] your neighbors against you he could turn
[52:14] the church against you he can do most
[52:18] anything and it's God's will for him to
[52:22] do
[52:23] it now that's tough to digest you got
[52:27] God using bad for
[52:35] good I find myself come
[52:39] on and I do this a lot that ain't
[52:41] nothing but the devil that's right
[52:43] giving the devil credit where he don't
[52:45] have any see when you in the will of God
[52:48] the devil don't have no power to do
[52:50] anything now if you out there I think
[52:51] it's first Peter says when you're out
[52:53] there H H uh murdering and and stealing
[52:55] and you a thief don't suffer as those do
[52:58] if you going to suffer suffer for Christ
[53:00] because when you're in his will you're
[53:02] what protected the prophet of God taught
[53:04] us that as long as you're in the will of
[53:05] God there's no safer place that you can
[53:08] be amen so we have to stop giving Satan
[53:11] credit for stuff that he ain't got
[53:12] nothing to do with that ain't nothing
[53:15] but the devil the devil messed with job
[53:17] the devil came with God gave permission
[53:19] for the devil to come and and attack job
[53:22] and I thought about this when the man
[53:24] came and told job you've lost everything
[53:27] he didn't say oh that ain't nothing but
[53:29] the
[53:30] devil that ain't nothing but the devil
[53:32] he got on his knees and says the lord
[53:34] giveth he knew as long as Lord I'm in
[53:37] your will you've got to be in control of
[53:40] this
[53:43] situation brother that's your Victory
[53:46] that's where you stand on now when you
[53:47] outside of the will of God God bless you
[53:50] I'll be praying for you but as long as
[53:53] you slap that that's why the disciples
[53:55] lost track of that they did did exactly
[53:57] what Jesus said he says take me on the
[53:59] boat I want to get on the other side
[54:01] they should have stood on that y Lord we
[54:03] in your will you told us to do this and
[54:05] we're doing it so we ain't got nothing
[54:07] to worry about but they lost
[54:09] track because sometimes we can get to a
[54:12] place as we're doing everything right
[54:14] that everything is going to be all right
[54:15] we're not going to come across trials
[54:16] we're not going to deal with things we
[54:18] don't understand when it's not the
[54:20] promise the promise is is I can help you
[54:22] overcome the promise is I'll be with you
[54:24] the promise is that you're Victorious
[54:26] amen amen amen so when things are out of
[54:30] control God is still in control amen
[54:34] amen it's tough to swallow but that's
[54:37] the truth anyhow amen amen so it it says
[54:41] here that he he desired um Paul desires
[54:45] to take this thing The Thorn away if we
[54:49] can pull that back up amen it
[54:53] says verse 7
[55:00] and lest I should be exalted above
[55:01] measure through the abundance of the
[55:03] revelations there was given to me a
[55:04] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[55:05] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[55:07] exalted above the heavens amen so what
[55:10] are the
[55:11] reasons uh God places these thorns in
[55:14] our
[55:15] life if you look at a
[55:17] rose uh the reason rose thorns are
[55:20] placed on roses is for protection that's
[55:23] right protection from who in this
[55:25] situation God was protecting Paul from
[55:29] himself we all know that that's can be
[55:32] our biggest enemy sometimes mother
[55:34] brandom said that the greatest enemy our
[55:36] God is William brandham he is the one
[55:38] that gets in God's way he's the one that
[55:41] gets lazy he's the one that gets to a
[55:43] place sometimes where he thinks he can
[55:45] do something about it and when he does
[55:49] that shoves God right out the picture oh
[55:52] yeah amen here's
[55:55] Paul one that was on the road to
[55:57] Damascus the first Messenger to the
[55:59] Ephesian Church age wrote 50% of the New
[56:02] Testament went to the third heavens and
[56:05] God still couldn't trust them with
[56:10] himself all God was going to do for Paul
[56:13] had done through Paul God still could
[56:16] not trust Paul with
[56:19] himself so if you get to a point to
[56:21] where you think you got it I'm in
[56:23] control that's room for Satan to come in
[56:25] and operate amen amen that's right so we
[56:29] think about the thorns in our life it is
[56:32] it is something that I I'm I'm I'm
[56:35] everybody struggles with it we all have
[56:36] thorns things in our life that we want
[56:38] God to take away but when you come to
[56:40] the realization that if you in his and
[56:42] that's not saying we going to fall short
[56:44] but when your desire is to get up and
[56:45] make it right that's in the will of
[56:48] God this Paul escorted to the third
[56:51] Heavens he's seen things that he can't
[56:52] even utter so a Paul either had a
[56:55] problem of Pride or he had the potential
[56:58] for Pride why cuz he says lest I be
[57:01] exalted above measure so here's God
[57:03] being reactive and proactive he placed
[57:06] this Thorn to either correct a sin in
[57:08] Paul's life or the potential for a sin
[57:11] why to protect Paul from himself right
[57:14] because Paul God had a greater work for
[57:16] Paul up ahead God saw that Paul was the
[57:19] only one on Earth that had been to the
[57:20] third Heavens he saw things God just
[57:23] wasn't focused on that he was looking
[57:25] ahead
[57:26] yeah amen you look at Jo um Joseph
[57:30] Joseph uh uh multiple times throughout
[57:33] his life Thorn after Thorn he's in
[57:35] Piper's house but he had no idea what
[57:38] was ahead of him but God knew so God is
[57:41] organizing all these situations in
[57:43] Joseph's life for preparation for one
[57:46] moment and God knew that brother Randon
[57:49] would preach exactly what Paul preached
[57:51] so he says Paul I don't want you to mess
[57:53] this up because my will is more
[57:55] important than what you want
[57:58] that's tough to swallow because
[58:00] sometimes our will uh we sang that song
[58:03] I'm I'm I'm uh the evidence of goodness
[58:05] running after me our good ain't always
[58:07] God's definition of good
[58:10] am so if we go back to verse 7 here lest
[58:13] I should be exalted above measure
[58:14] through the abundance of the revelations
[58:16] there was given to me a thorn in the
[58:18] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[58:20] me lest I should be exalted above uh
[58:23] measure so God placed this this thorn in
[58:25] Paul's life so when when he was tempted
[58:26] to exalt himself it would bring him back
[58:29] down to earth now here is the good part
[58:33] we've talked about the Thorns the pain
[58:35] but here's Paul's Victory verse 8 now
[58:39] what should we do brother maias should
[58:40] we just deal with these Thorns should we
[58:42] just be okay with them here's what Paul
[58:45] said not just as Paul the man of prayer
[58:46] says pray without sissing he says for
[58:49] this thing I besought the Lord
[58:53] Thrice that it might depart Me Lord I
[58:56] need you to get this out my life this
[58:59] person place a thing it is driving me
[59:03] crazy here's God's
[59:06] response and he said unto me now if
[59:09] you're reading this in your Bible this
[59:11] next passage is red
[59:13] letter so God's answer wasn't yes but
[59:17] Paul did get a
[59:18] response he says unto me my grace is
[59:21] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[59:23] made perfect in what weakness most
[59:26] gladly therefore will I rather glorify
[59:29] in my infirmities that the power of
[59:31] Christ May rest upon me
[59:34] amen Lord I come before you right now
[59:37] this this brother this man this person
[59:41] plac her thing I need you to take it
[59:44] away you said in your word that if I ask
[59:49] anything in your
[59:52] name that's usually our prayer sometimes
[59:57] Lord I need it gone it's
[1:00:00] uncomfortable I don't want to be going
[1:00:02] through
[1:00:03] this I've made that prayer most my
[1:00:06] probably about 90% of the time when I'm
[1:00:08] coming for prayer Lord I need you to fix
[1:00:10] something I need you to move something I
[1:00:11] need you to change something right Paul
[1:00:14] says three
[1:00:15] times so how long should you pray until
[1:00:19] he got an
[1:00:20] answer and he said to me see we've got
[1:00:24] to give God the freedom
[1:00:26] to give us an answer and it has to be
[1:00:28] the freedom to give him the answer that
[1:00:30] he wants to give see when you come to
[1:00:33] God and your answer is you want it to be
[1:00:36] yes you'll tune out the
[1:00:38] nose you cut you you put the earbuds in
[1:00:42] because the nose are are glaring right
[1:00:44] it's there but no that can't be you Lord
[1:00:46] that can't be you cuz I want you to say
[1:00:49] yes but Paul says and he said to me not
[1:00:54] yes not no but my grace is sufficient
[1:00:58] for thee I'm all you need I'm not going
[1:01:02] to take the thorn away it's going to
[1:01:04] stay there because you know why
[1:01:08] Paul for my strength is made perfect and
[1:01:12] weakness most gladly therefore will I
[1:01:15] rather glorify in my infirmities he got
[1:01:19] a response but it wasn't the answer he
[1:01:21] was looking
[1:01:23] for I want to go to a passage of
[1:01:25] scripture here just came up uh when I
[1:01:26] was in the back Genesis chter 20 see
[1:01:29] sometimes you know I I see why now the
[1:01:32] scripture says your righteousness is as
[1:01:34] filthy rags because sometimes we can
[1:01:37] think as long as we're doing the right
[1:01:38] thing acting the right way that that
[1:01:41] gives us to power to to not do things
[1:01:44] like the world does let me let me let's
[1:01:45] go to it's a very familiar passage of
[1:01:47] scripture Genesis 20 we start at
[1:01:50] verse um verse one uh this is a very
[1:01:53] familiar passage it is uh the story of
[1:01:56] Abraham and ailec AMC is a was the king
[1:02:00] of eev I believe back then and we don't
[1:02:02] have to go through the whole passage but
[1:02:04] just to kind of give you some context so
[1:02:06] ailec was the king and Sarah and Abraham
[1:02:09] comes and Abraham tells Sarah to lie and
[1:02:12] says I'm your sister um so we familiar
[1:02:15] with the story right all right so let's
[1:02:17] go down to um uh verse 6 this is God
[1:02:22] coming to
[1:02:23] ailec and God said unto him in they
[1:02:26] dream yeah I know that thou didst in the
[1:02:29] Integrity of thy heart for I also
[1:02:31] withheld from thee sinning let's go up
[1:02:33] to um verse three let's go to verse
[1:02:41] three it says verse three but God came
[1:02:43] to ailec in a Dream by night and said to
[1:02:47] him behold Thou Art but a dead man can
[1:02:51] you
[1:02:51] imagine in your sleep you wake up and
[1:02:54] God telling you you're a dead man
[1:02:56] okay he says Thou Art a dead man for the
[1:02:59] woman which thou Hast taken for she is a
[1:03:01] man's wife here's A's response but AMC
[1:03:05] had not come near her and he said Lord
[1:03:08] with thou slay also a righteous man Lord
[1:03:11] I ain't do nothing I didn't touch her I
[1:03:14] didn't mess with the Lord so will you
[1:03:15] slay a righteous man said he not unto me
[1:03:19] she is my sister and she even herself he
[1:03:22] is my brother in the Integrity of my
[1:03:25] heart and the innocency of my hands I
[1:03:28] have done this now here's something I
[1:03:30] never caught before In this passage of
[1:03:33] scripture he says and God said unto him
[1:03:36] in a dream yay I know that thou didn't
[1:03:39] do this in the Integrity of thy heart
[1:03:40] but catch this I also withheld thee from
[1:03:44] sinning against me let me be clear AMC
[1:03:49] the only reason you didn't touch her was
[1:03:51] because I ca you not to had nothing to
[1:03:55] do with you because I have a greater
[1:03:58] plan for Abraham and Sarah and I will
[1:04:01] not allow you to mess that up amen
[1:04:04] that's why we can't boast in our own
[1:04:05] goodness no matter how good you are it
[1:04:08] is God's grace that's keeping
[1:04:10] you you can be in the situation you be
[1:04:12] like man I I I want to do this I want to
[1:04:14] do that but something on the inside God
[1:04:17] has a greater plan and he says no not
[1:04:19] today that's why we are sinners saved by
[1:04:23] grace amen amen God's mercy kept him
[1:04:27] from doing that he says AB like you that
[1:04:30] that wasn't
[1:04:31] you you had nothing to do with that that
[1:04:35] was me causing you not to do
[1:04:38] that we all are sinners saved we a't
[1:04:41] that's why Works can't get you saved
[1:04:44] Works can't keep you God has to keep you
[1:04:46] and as long as you understand God's
[1:04:48] grace is sufficient for you that's all
[1:04:50] you need
[1:04:51] church amen God has to protect us from
[1:04:54] ourselves sometimes so he says my grace
[1:04:55] is sufficient for thee translation God
[1:04:58] please take this Thorn away and the
[1:05:00] answer was no I'm not going to take away
[1:05:03] your Thorn but I'm going to give you
[1:05:05] something to handle
[1:05:08] it how many times have God said no in
[1:05:10] our lives he told Jesus no In The Garden
[1:05:13] of Gethsemane Lord take this cup from me
[1:05:18] no but here's Jesus response Lord let
[1:05:20] not my will but let thy will be done
[1:05:26] if it's not his will we have to kind of
[1:05:28] be under the expectation Lord if I'm
[1:05:30] coming to you for something if it's not
[1:05:32] your will we have to be okay with the
[1:05:34] nose if it's not his timing we have to
[1:05:36] be okay with not yet if we're not ready
[1:05:39] we have to be okay with that because
[1:05:41] what happens is we're trying to manifest
[1:05:43] things and we get outside of the will of
[1:05:45] God
[1:05:47] Amen Paul's prayer was I'm tired of it
[1:05:49] God take it away and God's response was
[1:05:51] my grace is sufficient for thee verse 8
[1:05:54] 2 Corinthians nine says and God is able
[1:05:57] to make all grace abound toward you that
[1:06:00] ye always having all sufficiency in all
[1:06:03] things make abound to every good work
[1:06:06] now here is what should I be doing in my
[1:06:10] season of
[1:06:12] thorns verse
[1:06:14] 10 we go back to verse 9 and 2
[1:06:16] Corinthians 12 he says and he said to me
[1:06:17] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:06:19] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:06:21] most gladly therefore with I rather
[1:06:25] glorify so Paul is saying I have a
[1:06:27] choice to
[1:06:29] complain to make excuses or I can let
[1:06:32] the joy of the Lord be my
[1:06:36] strength those are your two options he
[1:06:38] says most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:06:41] glorify in my infirmities that the power
[1:06:43] check the order there so when I glorify
[1:06:46] in my infirmities then God's power
[1:06:48] starts to work his power starts to rest
[1:06:51] on me when I'm going through my Thorns
[1:06:52] and I say Lord I thank you anyway God's
[1:06:55] power begins to rest upon me amen
[1:06:58] therefore I take pleasure in my
[1:07:00] infirmities in reproaches in Necessities
[1:07:03] in persecutions and distresses for whose
[1:07:06] sake Christ for when I am
[1:07:09] weak then I am
[1:07:12] strong amen so when I'm going through my
[1:07:16] stuff and I don't have the answers when
[1:07:19] I begin to praise God in the midst of it
[1:07:22] amen amen he's made strong amen so
[1:07:25] there's an order there that's just not
[1:07:27] saying Lord I'm going to deal with the
[1:07:28] thorns and sit here and just wait he's
[1:07:30] saying most gladly therefore I'm going
[1:07:32] to glory in my infirmities fat the power
[1:07:37] of Christ fat the power of Christ those
[1:07:39] two go together when you glorify in your
[1:07:42] infirmities God's power that's why he
[1:07:44] says uh uh he shall renew your strength
[1:07:46] you shall M up on wings as Eagles when
[1:07:48] you start to glorify God in the midst of
[1:07:50] it that's where your power comes amen so
[1:07:52] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:07:54] so I'm going to use the devil Paul to
[1:07:56] make you weaker so you can see my power
[1:07:59] amen and that's the thing God would
[1:08:02] never be more real to us then when you
[1:08:05] have something in your life you can't
[1:08:07] fix that's when he wants to show up and
[1:08:11] show out
[1:08:14] sir so what am I supposed to do we just
[1:08:16] talked about it we've got to understand
[1:08:19] that God's praise gives us the victory
[1:08:22] over the enemy amen let's get Lord hand
[1:08:23] clap of praise cuz this unnatural right
[1:08:26] it's unnatural to jump and Shout around
[1:08:29] when you're still sick in your body when
[1:08:30] you going through things but Paul is
[1:08:32] telling you that's what you have to do
[1:08:34] amen that's how you get the victory amen
[1:08:37] so another reason God uses thorns in our
[1:08:40] life is for our development you know if
[1:08:43] you go to the hospital and you're
[1:08:48] dehydrated uh and they say hey we got to
[1:08:51] give you some uh we got to give you an
[1:08:52] IV you dehydrated Mr Armstrong and we've
[1:08:54] got to rejuvenate your uh your
[1:08:58] dehydration you can say no I don't want
[1:09:01] that needle in my arm because it hurts
[1:09:04] but most people would say yes why
[1:09:06] because you know in the pain of that
[1:09:08] needle is your
[1:09:09] Restoration in the pain of that needle
[1:09:12] is your strength so yes stick me doctor
[1:09:14] I'll endure the pain because I know at
[1:09:16] the end of the day when I walk out of
[1:09:18] here I'll be back to
[1:09:20] 100% so the Thorns that are placed in
[1:09:22] our life God sometimes uses it to
[1:09:24] develop us it's like a jean seed that's
[1:09:26] on the inside of us God wants us to grow
[1:09:28] so a lot of times he put thorns in our
[1:09:30] life to develop that growth I want to go
[1:09:33] to a passage of scripture here um let's
[1:09:36] go to Job chapter
[1:09:38] 42 everybody good amen
[1:09:45] amen when a child is born and the seed
[1:09:47] is
[1:09:49] planted all that that child will ever be
[1:09:52] is inside of that seed
[1:09:55] the only thing that prevents us me you
[1:09:58] everybody else from seeing it is one
[1:10:00] word and that's
[1:10:01] development so here is Job chapter 42 uh
[1:10:05] we all know the the story of job but we
[1:10:07] typically only care about like two main
[1:10:10] pieces that's the beginning and the end
[1:10:12] he lost everything and God gave it all
[1:10:14] back but there's a lot in the Book of
[1:10:17] Job so job finds himself uh where he
[1:10:20] he's I would say uh confused about this
[1:10:23] thorn in his life
[1:10:26] he's confused about Lord why is this
[1:10:28] there what's going on I know I've been
[1:10:30] dealing with for this for too long but
[1:10:32] come on now I need an answer help me
[1:10:34] understand so he's questioning God and
[1:10:36] God takes him on a journey uh he takes
[1:10:38] him to the cosmos and tells him job did
[1:10:40] you do this job were you here when I did
[1:10:42] that job's response is no I wasn't and
[1:10:44] then he finds
[1:10:46] himself in job the last chapter here
[1:10:50] 42 this is the development then job
[1:10:53] answered the Lord and said after he gets
[1:10:55] through all of this job answered the
[1:10:58] Lord and said I know that thou can't do
[1:11:01] everything now cat now you got to in
[1:11:03] order to cat the revelation of this you
[1:11:04] have to figure out where job started he
[1:11:07] had everything righteous man then God
[1:11:11] said that about
[1:11:12] him but he finds himself in this
[1:11:15] situation after he has lost everything
[1:11:18] to job answered the Lord and said I know
[1:11:21] that thou can't do everything you didn't
[1:11:23] know that before job
[1:11:26] and that no thought can be withholden
[1:11:29] from thee who is he that hideth counsel
[1:11:33] without knowledge therefore have I
[1:11:35] uttered that I understood not things too
[1:11:39] wonderful for me which I knew not so
[1:11:41] hold a
[1:11:43] minute the victory of job was just not
[1:11:46] about him getting his stuff back uhhuh
[1:11:49] it was about this point right here job I
[1:11:52] want you to know that there is more to
[1:11:54] me than you
[1:11:57] realized which I knew not job said Lord
[1:12:01] I didn't know all this about
[1:12:03] you I didn't know that this and that he
[1:12:07] says your plans cannot be
[1:12:10] thwarted who is that that hideth counsel
[1:12:12] without knowledge therefore I have
[1:12:13] uttered that I understood not things too
[1:12:15] wonderful which I knew not so you want
[1:12:18] to say Lord why am I going through this
[1:12:20] situation in my
[1:12:22] life God is saying I want you to draw
[1:12:25] closer to me there is see when
[1:12:27] everything's going right everything's
[1:12:29] going good God still wants you to draw
[1:12:33] closer he still wants you to be as the
[1:12:35] deer panted for the water brick so does
[1:12:37] my soul thirst for thee Oh God he still
[1:12:39] wants that connection so it took him
[1:12:41] taking everything from job for job to
[1:12:44] get to this point Lord there's more to
[1:12:47] you than I
[1:12:49] realized when he got to this point then
[1:12:52] the restoration happened
[1:12:55] all of that happened for job he had to
[1:12:58] lose everything to realize Lord I didn't
[1:13:02] have everything when I had
[1:13:05] everything sometimes these Thorns these
[1:13:08] things in our life that God places it is
[1:13:10] because yeah you're doing good yeah
[1:13:13] you're going to church and I love you
[1:13:15] for that but I need you to draw just a
[1:13:17] little bit
[1:13:18] closer I need you to love me a little
[1:13:20] bit more not saying you're doing
[1:13:22] anything wrong I love you keep coming to
[1:13:24] church church but there is more to me
[1:13:27] than you realize
[1:13:29] amen so whatever I got to do to get you
[1:13:32] to that point yeah amen as the prophet
[1:13:36] of God said he allowed the devil to go
[1:13:38] loose and he says he'll put bits in
[1:13:40] Satan's mouth and he'll control it
[1:13:43] controlling every aspect he can't take
[1:13:46] you out but God's objective is to use
[1:13:48] that so you can get to this point to say
[1:13:51] Lord there is more love that I know
[1:13:54] about there is more Grace that I knew
[1:13:56] about there is more joy that I knew
[1:13:58] about more peace in this understanding
[1:14:01] Lord that I don't know why I'm going
[1:14:02] through this but realizing you're the
[1:14:04] one who's keeping me you're the one who
[1:14:07] kept
[1:14:08] [Applause]
[1:14:09] me I didn't know that about you God Lord
[1:14:13] I Thank you for the Thorns amen
[1:14:17] amen there is more to you than I
[1:14:20] realized and as I look through my life
[1:14:23] when I go to this passage of scripture
[1:14:25] and I go through situ cuz like I said
[1:14:26] before when we walk outside those doors
[1:14:29] if you've never experienced a thorn in
[1:14:31] your life something that is stuck there
[1:14:33] that God placed there and he won't move
[1:14:36] you will as long as you keep drawing
[1:14:38] closer to God there will be things that
[1:14:41] God will place in your life to protect
[1:14:43] you to keep you because he has a plan
[1:14:47] for everybody in this church and there's
[1:14:51] nothing you can do Satan can do can
[1:14:53] change that so what whatever God has to
[1:14:55] do he'll put precautionary methods in
[1:14:58] place to protect you from
[1:15:01] yourself but he also has a hedge of
[1:15:03] protection around you Satan can't do
[1:15:06] nothing without his permission so as
[1:15:08] long as you in the will of God church
[1:15:10] that is your protection look that so so
[1:15:13] we we've got to keep pressing towards
[1:15:14] the mark because as long as you're
[1:15:16] pressing that's your protection so when
[1:15:19] things come up in your life you can say
[1:15:20] Lord I know this is you because I've
[1:15:23] been serving you I've been doing
[1:15:24] everything I can Lord yes I fall short
[1:15:26] but I come to church the next day and I
[1:15:28] say Lord I'm sorry amen amen that's your
[1:15:33] strength that is Paul Paul said he said
[1:15:36] to me and that's all Paul needed I don't
[1:15:39] need nothing El as long as you give me
[1:15:40] an answer am he said to me directly
[1:15:43] that's a RMA word directly to me amen as
[1:15:47] musicians come let's give a little hand
[1:15:48] clap of Praise so my
[1:15:51] prayer as I continue down this path that
[1:15:55] I'm in this chapter that I in said Lord

[1:15:59] help me to see you in it amen amen help
[1:16:03] me not to lose focus of you in this
[1:16:05] situation In This Storm amen as a song

[1:20:06] holy amen appreciate the Lord
[1:20:09] tonight get a lot of hands
[1:20:12] PR amen God is good amen thorn in our
[1:20:16] flesh amen you know I was thinking as he
[1:20:19] was uh ministering tonight and sometimes
[1:20:22] we want things to leave but you know I
[1:20:25] always been saying here for the last
[1:20:28] longest now I says I'm just going to
[1:20:30] start accepting what the will of God is
[1:20:33] it' be hard sometime especially early in
[1:20:36] the Christian Journey but I said one
[1:20:39] thing about it our goal is to make
[1:20:41] Heaven our home amen you know I was
[1:20:43] talking to the church down other week
[1:20:45] and I was riding down there I said as I
[1:20:47] was riding down there I was thinking
[1:20:49] it'll be December in a couple of weeks
[1:20:52] this whole year just flew past amen and
[1:20:55] I says that time is going so fast but I
[1:20:59] says that's why we living this life so
[1:21:02] we can get to that new
[1:21:03] kingdom and so I said from now on you
[1:21:06] know I was I was going to do a whole
[1:21:09] sermon on
[1:21:10] variation and what it does to the body
[1:21:14] naturally and spiritually so I was
[1:21:16] praying about it praying one day and
[1:21:18] that came to me I said you know I ain't
[1:21:20] worrying no more I said God if it's your
[1:21:23] will things might catch you by surprise
[1:21:28] but I said just if I can just shake
[1:21:30] myself like Samson did I said God if
[1:21:32] it's your will that's what I'm that's
[1:21:34] what I'm going with because I know one
[1:21:36] thing God can't fail and everything he
[1:21:39] does is right it might look wrong it
[1:21:43] might look like why but everything God
[1:21:45] does is right he can't fail right and I
[1:21:48] I saying you know one thing about it
[1:21:50] things sometimes in life happen and we
[1:21:54] say how in the world good going to come
[1:21:56] out of it but I know one thing God can't
[1:21:59] break not one of his promises not one
[1:22:02] his words will ever fall to the ground
[1:22:05] and the Bible says that all things work
[1:22:08] together to the good of them that love
[1:22:10] the Lord am so one one thing I'm holding
[1:22:13] on to amen right now is the word of God
[1:22:16] Amen I'm learning to hold on to that now
[1:22:19] with all I got yes sir because that's
[1:22:21] the only thing that that's faithful in
[1:22:23] all things that's the only only thing
[1:22:24] that's going to be standing in the end
[1:22:26] is the word of God I say a lot of times
[1:22:28] that's all I got right because I've been
[1:22:31] failed on every hand come on I don't
[1:22:33] know about you but I've been failed on
[1:22:35] every hand come on but it's one that
[1:22:38] never felt me from the beginning when he
[1:22:40] started leading and guiding me he always
[1:22:43] been there he never failed me and never
[1:22:46] will I don't believe he ever will
[1:22:48] because he's God Amen So I says when you
[1:22:50] oh that thorn that's in your flesh like
[1:22:53] Paul says God Jesus told him my grace is
[1:22:56] sufficient for you he says so I glory in
[1:22:59] my infirmities right that the power of
