seeds god bless you um god bless you so much certainly happy to be in the house of the lord i don't know about you but i just love to be in the house of the lord i mean uh we are living in a time where these days people don't want to come to church they want to have their food delivered they want to have things come through amazon but with god it doesn't work like that god has principles by which we have to work with we you gotta come to church and there's a blessing in coming to church praise the lord if you take an egg if you put it under a pup it will hatch why it takes the atmosphere when you come to church you are coming under the right atmosphere and by obeying the word of god there is a blessing that comes with that praise be to god uh special greeting from my family my wife i think she's in the nursery my name is brother aaron i'm from zimbabwe i i came to united states in 2019 uh i've been in africa all my life so i i never thought i would be here i would we used to have elder we i call him elder simons come and preach for us in africa all through the years such a wonderful pillar in the message in the faith and we love him so much the family and the flock here we we stream whenever we get a chance and we love everyone here and um i consider myself a double pilgrim a pilgrim in the spirit in the pilgrim in the flesh just coming over to the united states of america but uh there's no place that we can call our home our home is above whether i'm in africa in australia in america that's just a place to drop but our home is above praise god so if we can stand and get read a portion of the word tonight being that this is a midweek service we don't intend to take a lot of time out be you know ministering for a few minutes and then we will be ready to go back home if you come to church on sunday you're a conqueror if you come on friday evening you are more than conqueror praise god revelations chapter 15 verse 1 revelation chapter 15 verse 1. i love the book of revelations the bible says and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god and i saw as it were the sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten victory over the beast and over his name and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the hops of god they sang the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints praise be to god you may take your seeds we can also read back in revelation chapter 14 verse 3 the bible says and they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could lend that song but the 144 000 which were redeemed from the earth praise god so this was a song of the redeemed so today we want to talk about a golden half and a new song praise god so these ones were redeemed by god and because they had victory they were singing a new song every victory a new song comes out of every victory praise god there is no song that comes without some form of experience all the wonderful songs that we have they came through a revival most of them were written during the time of the revival because when god gives the victory that's when people sing a new song and i want you to understand from the scriptures that we'll read tonight that it's not only these 144 000 that are supposed to sing a new song you and me by believing the bible by be receiving jesus christ in our life and getting victory over the world we ought to sing a new song the fact that we can wake up in the morning and we know that jesus christ is our savior that ought to give us a new song but the devil does not want us to sing a new song the devil wants us to complain the devil wants us to maim her the devil wants us to look at what we don't have he does not want us to praise god for what we have but i want to tell you tonight there is a song that you can sing and god wants to hear that song in the beginning was god and the word is elohim the self-existing one and he had attributes in him and he wanted to be worshiped god wanted to be praised why did god choose to redeem men so that they can be to the brit to the praise of his own glory god redeemed us so that we can sing in praise god heals us so that we can give him praise hallelujah david said i will not die but i will leave to declare the works of god i will not die but i will leave to sing the song of the redeemed praise be to god when you have victory over alcohol you ought to sing a new song when you have victory over cocaine you ought to sing a new song when you have victory over yourself you ought to sing the song of the lamb hallelujah why were the children of israel consumed in the wilderness because they were complaining they were looking at their it's their self they're looking at their inabilities but i want their abilities but i want to tell you tonight god is not interested in your abilities god wants you to look at what he can do for you god wants you to look at the cross of calvary and when you look at the cross of calvary then you can sing a new song and you say we crown you with many crowns high and lifted up where thing is the lamp that's what the songs of the redeemed that's the song that they were singing right here where things the lord's got almighty who is who was and who shall come hallelujah they overcame the beast they overcame his name they overcame his power but they realized it wasn't in them it was in the lamp if we are ever to come out of this age it's not going to be our works it has to be the works of god it has to be what jesus christ did for us recovery you see folks that say i don't want to come to church i will come to church once i quit doing this you will never quit doing that you have to come to church in your condition you have to come to church with your situation because when you come to church with your situation you are saying lord i've got this situation but i am trusting you but you if you say i'm going to stop doing this and come to church what you're telling god is that i will sort out my problems then i can worship you you cannot worship god unless you are redeemed [Music] let's read a scripture here the bible says in exodus chapter 3 verse 12 and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a talking unto thee that i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt you shall save god upon this mountain so god was telling moses that the sign that i've sent you is that when you bring them out of egypt you shall worship god on this mountain praise god what did god say and to unto moses he said say unto pharaoh let my people go that they may worship me hallelujah how many knows that redemption is in two parts the word church it means cold out of so god called the vine out of egypt and he brought them into israel so that they can worship god he says pharaoh let my people go that they may come and worship me in other words you cannot worship god in bondage you cannot worship god in the world you have to come out of the word by the preaching of the gospel and that's when you can worship god you cannot serve two masters either you will love one or despise the other praise be to god you cannot have two husbands one has to die before you can live with other that's a bible principle praise god so when when god takes you from egypt and he redeems you from slavery and then he takes you to the promised land then you can sing the song of the redeemed hallelujah the bible says let the redeemer the the redeemed of the lord say so why don't we have a shout to do these days why don't we have praise these days it's because people have you know salvation they've lost the joy of salvation you can lose you can never lose your salvation but you can lose the joy of your salvation that's why david says in psalm chapter 51 respond unto me the joy of my salvation and give me a right spirit hallelujah because without the joy of salvation you cannot serve god perfectly we'll be dragging you to church oh today is friday service let's just go to the sunday service why can't we stream you know the joy of salvation has been lost and god has to come back and restore that joy to that joy of salvation it's like when you you know first hearing marriage or you know when you fall in love there's josh you can't wait to be with each other you can't wait to see each other you want to talk to each other when once that joy is lost then the marriage is no longer sweet but once that joy is in the home then you have a wonderful marriage that's the same thing with jesus christ we want we have to have the joy of salvation that's the joy that makes us sing with all our hearts that's the joy that makes us testify to our neighbors the reason why you are afraid to tell your neighbour about jesus christ is because you have lost the joy of salvation people in the world are corrupt and they are not afraid to tell you know people who they are what they are some are these days you know they say i am lgbtq and different things they are not ashamed that's what they want that's what they've chose but you being choosing to become a christian amen it ought to be the most beautiful thing that you are ready to tell everyone out there praise god but that joy has been lost in this generation i see young people that's why you see because if you have the joy of salvation then the the things of this world will not matter to you but if you lose the joy of salvation you will try to find joy somewhere and the joy of salvation is not something that a pastor can give you it's not something that your parents can give you it's something that the holy spirit has to give you inside your heart you can say well i've been i've been in the i've been in church for all my life i've been in the message for 10 years that means nothing if you have lost the joy of salvation if you have lost the joy of salvation you're as good as someone who is out there hallelujah we have got a lot of folks that are sitting in the bench but they have lost the joy of salvation but tonight we want god to help us so that we can go back to the song of the redeemed so that we can have the same spirit that these brothers said when they say amazing grace how sweet the sound praise be to god we ought to be a people that are on fire for god because we are living in a very very evil generation we are living we are coming we have come in a junction time is blending into eternity many accidents happen at a junction that's what they say because you have to choose we're in a crossroads you know it's like a young man who's you know going into marriage he's a junction and the devil will be waiting all his life to wait for that young man when it comes to that junction that young lady looking for a young man to get married to it's a junction so we have beca we have come at a junction in this end time and the prophet of god says at every junction god sends an angel hallelujah praise be to god some chapter 137 verse one the bible says by the rivers of babylon there we sat down here we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our hops upon the wheels in the midst thereof for they they they that carried us away captive required us a song and they that wasted us require us for a myth saying sing unto us of the songs of zion how shall we sing the songs of zion in a strange land in other words if we are in babylon we cannot sing the songs of zion we cannot you cannot sing a new song when you are in babylon and babylon means confusion and we have got three babylons in the bible we have the first babylon of nimrod which was called the tower of babel and we have the babylon in the midst of the bible in the book of of daniel which was the babylon of nebuchadnezzar and we have the last babylon which we are right now in the book of revelations which is called mystery babylon but it's the same spirit a spirit of confusion babylon means confusion where people don't know whether they are men or they are women people don't know whether you are a father or a boss it's a spirit of confusion but the bible says that it shall be light in the evening time and the path of glory shall surely find praise be to god and the bible is they that escaped out of babylon and we are here tonight the redeemed of the lord being redeemed from babylon being redeemed from confusion bringing redeemed from denominationalism being redeemed from religion to a relationship with jesus christ from the law to revelation from legislation to revelation you don't need anyone to tell you you ought to wear something modest you don't need anyone to tell you you don't have to go to this place the holy spirit is living in you will tell you i'm not going to wear this i'm not i'm not going to go there the bible says i will take away the stone heart oh glory to god and i will give you the heart of flesh and i will give you a new spirit hallelujah and then i will put my spirit within you just having a new spirit my precious brother you don't speak bread about your neighbor by just having a new spirit not the holy spirit a new spirit the new spirit will tell you i can't say something bad about my pastor and your spirit will tell you i have to go to church i have to i have to pay my tithe that just requires a new spirit the holy ghost is too harsh just a new spirit for you to have the basics hallelujah so these were in babylon and they were told to sing the songs of the redeemed and they cried he said lord how can we sing the songs of the redeemed when we are in a strange land you can you can unless you are born again you cannot see the kingdom of god unless you are born again the songs of amazing grace they mean nothing to you unless you are born again the bible means nothing to you unless you are born again church means nothing to you but when you are born again then you can sing the songs of the redeemed then you can cry with tears in your eyes son when i save your calls i will answer when they call for my name i will share from heaven hallelujah wash because you have been redeemed praise be to god hallelujah praise be to god psalms chapter 40 verse 1 the bible says i waited patiently for the lord stop i waited presciently for the lord something that we don't have in this urge we are used to having things fast it has to be on the app fast you know you order it it comes everything has to be fast 5g with god things don't work like that god follows his own clock and it's not like a domino's clock it's not like chick-fil-a clock it's god's clock you have to work by god's clock if god says wait you wait hallelujah i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and hurt my cry i love that god hears our cry god sees our tears god knows our burdens he's a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities hallelujah he brought me also out of the horrible peace praise god how many can testify he brought me from the horrible peace do you know where you came from do you know what you wear and you know what you are tonight it's god that took you from the horrible peace praise be to god once i was lost but now i'm found thank god i'm free thank god i'm fear praise be the gods praise be to god it reminds me of the old negro song free at last fear at last thank god and free at last i hope that's politically correct americans they are very sensitive no you can't say that hey brother in africa we are free we can say whatever we can do whatever praise god but in america you have to be very careful you know out of the mirror clay and set my feet upon the rock and established my goings and he has put a new song in my mouth god has to give you a new song how many remember the testimony of george carter who when when god healed her she stood up and she went on the piano and she started playing there is a fountain and the prophet says she blessed the grass she went on to bless the flowers why because god had healed her after redemption the next thing that comes is just wait until we get in the rapture you will want to have time to talk to one another who will be singing the songs of redemption and the angels won't be able to join the song because they have never been lost but we can worship god in a perfect way because we were once lost and we are fought hallelujah psalms 137 i think i've read this one the bible says in exodus chapter 3 30 verse 13 and every firstling of an ass thou shall redeem with the lamp and if thou shalt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of of uh among the children thou shalt redeem so the donkey was redeemed by a lamp now a donkey being redeemed by a lamp i was that donkey useless something that you know is of no virtue but because there was a lamp a donkey could be redeemed because there was a lamp a drunkard could be redeemed because there was a lamp and an adjective could be redeemed because of the power of the lamp hallelujah i want us to read a scripture let me find here it's in ezekiel chapter 18 verse 1 to 3. ezekiel chapter 18 verse 103 if we have our bibles the bible says and the word of the lord came unto me again saying what do you mean ye that he used this proverbs concerning the land of israel saying the father have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge as i live said the lord you shall not have occasion anymore to use this proverb in israel so they were singing a song right the father's their father's eight sour grabs and the children's teeth are set on age and god heard it and i want to say tonight that god hears everything that we say the conversations that we have with our children on the kitchen table god he is that the things that we speak in silence god hears that god hears our thoughts so these were in babylon and they were they were saying these proverbs because you know what these were children that were born in babylon so they were saying you our father sinned and god sent them in babylon right and these children were born in babylon and they were saying you know what we are suffering for something that we don't know nothing about it's not us that saint it's our fathers that sins and they were carried away into slavery and we are here born in slavery and we are suffering for something that we didn't do so they came up with this proverb and they were saying the fathers hate sour grapes but the children's teeth are the ones that are set on age and god read that proverb and he didn't like it and he said you shall not use that prophet praise god because we are born under sin through adam in other words our condemnation came by representation whether you you did not choose to be born the way you were born it was because of what adam did some of us were in the inner circumstances of what that we are not because of our choice but because of the way we were born because of the families we were born unto because of the way we came amen but that's not where you stop amen god said to ezekiel you shall not use that proverb and if you read down god said if a man shall turn away from his sins and ask for forgiveness the bible says god says i will not take the the sins of his of the father upon him in other words the same way you are condemned by representation through adam is the same way you are justified by representation through jesus christ hallelujah so you don't have to do anything you found yourself in this situation you were born in a family that had many problems you were born in a family some say my family had many demons but i want to tell you something your current circumstance does not mean nothing the only thing you have to do is to trust god if we look at abraham he was he was he was born in babylon he was worshiping idols he could have said hey you know what i can't help myself look at my records look at my the way i was raised up because we are living in a time where you know there is a lot of victim mentality right but when it comes when it comes to the word you don't have to have that you have to trust god in your own circumstances why i'm saying so is because sometimes you know we put a lot on ourselves on our past he said he said brother aaron if only i didn't have this criminal record i could have a good i could have a good job god is not looking at that tonight i believe that god can work miracles you just have to trust god praise be to god my parents didn't go to school my parents didn't go to school they can't even read english i mean but i trusted in the lord and i've always trusted in the lord i'm here in america i don't have my family i only have my wife and you know you folks here but i'm trusting god i've lived in a country where inflation has gone thousand percent i mean we broke all kinds of records in zimbabwe when it comes to inflection so right now i'm at a point where nothing moves me if inflation is five percent it doesn't move me i'm i'm way past that hallelujah you talk about gas price this is nothing that should say people in america be like whoa the lord is coming look at the prices the lord has always been falling apart you're just starting to see it right you travel around ask brother simons you travel around where you go to some places they don't even have clean drinking water man but here people are mad because someone took their parking spots you know someone would be mad just because someone you know someone sit at my pew it's because we don't know what life is if if we had known you'll just be praising god for what you have praise me to god praise be to god you ought to thank god for what you have praise be to god amen but people think the lord that they're americans i thank god i'm an american you ought to thank the lord that you are a son of god amen so god was saying don't you sing that broken song to say you know what you know because sometimes people try to these are the people that begs like they want to find food with god the first sign of backsliding is finding fault with god that's what cain did lord what am i supposed to do my punishment is too great for me if it sounds like you you judge god to say god you're unfair but let me tell you something god is just god is fair god knows exactly what we are supposed to be where we are supposed to be what we're supposed to be amen i've seen sometimes people you know god just blesses them a little bit they buy a nice car i would listen to some testimonies the brother said you know what i was a very good boy until i started working i mean i bought a mustang that's when i basically i left god so you come to find out that god knows that if i give this person this thing i'll lose them so if you look at everything put together you see that god knows exactly what he's doing and god is just and you cannot judge god by what you see on the natural anybody you might see me say brother aaron is driving a very nice car but you don't know some disease that i'm battling every day right you don't know how many months the doctors have given me to leave if i if we exchange our problems you say you know what i'd rather have my problems so at the end of the day god knows exactly what he's doing you have to trust and thank the lord with whatever you have and you ought to worship and praise god you don't just praise god when you come to church you praise god every day you praise god in the morning you praise god in the afternoon you praise god in the evening but we have come to an age where the bible says that people shall be ungrateful people are angry and always angry i can't blame them because of what they're saying on the internet what they are seeing on the news and nobody is reading what this press is saying if you wake up in the morning you read what this person is saying you'll be in a good mood before you go to sleep at night don't go to cnn or foxes what does the bible say what does god say about my gas prices amen hallelujah you will find that god will say how i will provide and they say praise god god will provide how can you see miracles unless you come through difficult situations it takes difficult situations to come up with testimonies situations like this i like them because that's when people start to say brother aaron i want to thank the lord you know i was praying i didn't have money for gas and gods of light and i start to see god moving among his people you see we are living in a time where men's hearts have become so calloused amen after covet i thought people are gonna come back to church fill up the churches but people got worse they actually got worse i think we're in a time where nothing can move people right now even if russia destroys the whole europe people still not come to church but you and i are not part of that group amen we are part of the redeemed praise be to god let me rush now i'm about to close in a few here so we find out that here is what the prophet says now to you that say it's wrong for you to be represented by adam as a sinner what about through representation we have salvation also you can no more save yourself than you could take your boots traps and jump over to the moon with it you can no more you're boring seen your your renegade to start with every one of us and we could not help ourselves and how we ever going to be saved one come one come to represent us so jesus christ came to save us so that we can be to the praise of his glory let's read ephesians chapter chapter 1 verse 1 the bible says verse four according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in life having predestinated us unto adoption of children by jesus christ so here the bible says that he he predestinated us to come to adoption you can say you know what i'm predestined i can do whatever i want i'm predestinated i cannot be lost i can just go back in the world that shows that you are not predestinated because the scripture here is that we are predestinated to come to adoption amen in other words we are we are there is a power of transformation that changes us until we become like jesus and we are adopted in shame amen the adoption of of jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen verse 6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherewith he has accepted us in the beloved so we are praised to come to the praise of the glory of his grace so we was we are saved and redeemed and predestinated so that we can be to the praise of his own grace amen we have to praise god with a song of peace amen when they used to go to war one time they asked god through a prophet lord what shall we do and god says judah must go first how many knows that whenever they went to bedrock judah went first and what does judah mean mean judah means praise the praises of god has to go for us and the blessings will come down but today we don't come to church with praise what does the bible say in the book of psalms enter in his case within thanksgiving in praise what does the singer say i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise that's the approach to god there's a way to approach the the queen of england there's a protocol there's a way to approach anything in life and the way to approach god is to praise amen hallelujah juja means praise that's why if you read guinness beginners when jacob was blessing the tribes he said children my son thou art a lion squad you are a son of a lion and because he was a son of a lion he was a king and the bible says well because you are an old lion who shall arouse you you are fearless because you praise god you are jews you praise god when you when you don't have shoes you praise god when you have got a meal you praise god when you have a house you praise god in apartments you praise the lord anyhow when you are in the hospital you praise god poor and silence when they were in the prison chains hallelujah they did not look at their chains they did not remember they did not say oh if only jesus christ was here they begin to praise they begin to praise god and when they were praising god their chains were broken because they were singing the song of redemption they were singing the song of the redeemed amen but today we have got artificial praise people only come to a concert they sing these beautiful songs but every day they live all kinds of life you have to praise god every day amen and you have to worship god with your eyes the bible says worship god in the beauty of his holiness when you live a concentrated life you are worshiping god because god does not dwell with being buildings the monster dwells in tabernacles in the house of man amen hallelujah that's why god loves judah that's why god loved david amen david was the only one that could slay goliath because it took a bit of praise to move such a situation if you read revelation chapter chapter five the bible says that the 24 elders the angels they all cast down their crowns then they were praising god because the lamb was worth to take the book and to redeem man they were worshiping god but today we have got people who are complaining only if the government can do this for us let me tell you this politicians will not do anything for you amen politicians will never change your life amen but god can change your life hallelujah how many knows that amen we ought to praise god in our hearts we ought to praise god every day of our lives we think we praise god for your children you bring them to church it shows that you are thankful to god but if you have children and you want to bring them to church it means that you are ungrateful because praising god it's not lip service it's a life amen because the bible says that they worship me with their lips but their hearts are far from me amen so true worship and praise comes from the heart that's what god wants praise god amen my time is up but i want to say this to you church let's sing a song of praise to him amen let's sing the song after the team to share if there was a time that the light has shined so bright it's in this time that we're living it why because it's the darkest hour that's the darkest hour where there's just a rampant scene there's just corruption some of sometimes i just feel like you know what maybe this is just america but i i found out i know it's all over the world anyway where you go because these things are spirits amen so let judah go up first let's praise him let's praise god first so these sayings that we read in revelations chapter 15 14 and 15 the bible says they were standing on the sea of on a sea of glass and the sea of glass if you read in the old testament the tabernacle of moses the tabernacle of moses had three compartments so the outer court there were two things that were on the outer court there was a an outer of sacrifice which had four horns those are the ones that you read in the bible which are called the horns of the out those are the horns that you know joab would go and grab when he was in trouble and then the other thing that was there was there was a was it was a brass a a a a a basin called a lava that they used to put water in the priest to wash their hands and wash sacrifices and that was in the old testament and that water represented the word that washes and cleanses us and here in the book of revelations we find that before the throne of god there is a sea of glass and the sea of glass and this one if you read chapter five the sea of glass was clear because the prophet says that you know redemption people the rapture had come but if you read chapter 15 this water it had fire and blood because these people were redeemed from the tribulation from difficult circumstances and because of that they were singing the song of the lamb amen that's a type of you and me we will not go through the tribulation the bride will not go through a tribulation but we are redeemed from different circumstances and we ought to sing the song of praise if we can stand upon our faith tonight have you lost the joy of your salvation are you here and you say lord i'm just coming to church but i've lost the joy of salvation you no longer read your bible the way you used to read your bible you no
