But I won't leave you comfortless here and then I will take you on my comfort till I come again. My Holy Spirit I send so you won't be alone. He'll keep you till I take you home.

We thank you for what you're doing, and we ask that you come down and continue to move. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. If you got your Bibles this morning, we'll turn to the book of Exodus. How many glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 3 and we will start in verse one. When you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it reads, "Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel and the angel of the Lord appeared upon unto unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt." And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses, Moses," and he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet from for the place where on thou standest is holy ground is holy ground." Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was a afraid to look upon God. Amen. God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. This morning I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled the the backside of the desert. The back side of the desert. And I started looking at this topic and realizing that when you go through the scriptures, you realize that almost every man of God that was in the scripture had one of these moments. They had one of these times where God led them to a place where they were all alone. God led them to a place where they had to get by themselves. Whether it was by choice or by God's purpose, Jesus went into the wilderness because it was a choice. But Moses, he had to flee to get into the wilderness. But when he got there, something happened. He had an experience with God that changed the rest of his life. He had an experience with God that he could point to that moment and said, "I know God is real because of this experience that I've had." Just imagine if you were outside and you saw something burning, but it wasn't being burnt. It was on fire. You see the fire, you see the smoke, but nothing is burning. That's what Moses, he encountered when he was in the wilderness. And he had to turn aside because he might have seen a thousand thousands of fires. They said when the desert gets hot enough, things catch on fire. But see, he might have seen thousands. But it was something different about this fire. and said, "It's just like Elijah said. He said, "It's just like fire shut up in my bones." See, when that fire took place, it was something that changed how he looked at that fire cuz he knew it was different. He had seen fire all his life, but this fire was different. This fire had a calling to it. This fire could speak to him, could have a conversation with him. When he came and saw it, he said, "Don't come here because where you're standing is holy ground." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it it was something about this experience that Moses had. And whenever he got in trouble, he could always point back to this experience that he had. He could always point back and say, "I know God is real because he met me in the burning bush. He met me and he spoke to me. He had a conversation with me and he told me what I was supposed to do." Many of times, how many of us have those backside of the desert experiences in life? Where you come to the moments where you're all alone? You come to the moments where you're by yourself. You come to the moments where you feel like all hope is gone. And then God will show up right on the scene. He'll show up and show you that I'm real. I I've always heard your prayers. I've seen what you've been going through. And I'm coming down to speak to you today. I'm coming down to tell you something so that you can continue to go on. You can continue to fight the battle. You can go back to Egypt with confidence that God is real and that God is going to deliver his people. &gt;&gt; That's why God came in the desert that day cuz it was a time God had heard the cries of his people. He said, "No longer will I let them stay in Egypt. It's time for me to go and deliver them, but I got to go get somebody attention. I got to go down there and show them. I got to go down there to Moses and say, "Hey, the thing that they was telling you that you was prophesied over that you was told to do, it's time for you to go fulfill it. It's time for you to go do your purpose. It's time for you to go do what God wants you to do." &gt;&gt; But you see, he had to come down and he had to do something to show him, hey, this isn't ordinary. This isn't something that you're imagining. This is something that's real. &gt;&gt; And and nobody can tell you the experience that you have with God. Because when you have it, it's individualized to you. Nobody knows how to get your attention like God knows how to get your attention. Nobody knows how to speak to you like God knows how to speak to you. And he might use the smallest things. He can use the greatest things, but sometimes he just wants to do something that'll get your attention. &gt;&gt; He just wants to do something that'll show you, hey, it's not I'm not just what everybody else may believe in. I'm the one and only true God. I'm the one and only that created heavens and earth. The one that that's alpha and omega from the beginning of the end. And I saw this. I knew this. And I knew that you would be here. I knew what you would go through and I understood it. That's why I came to the cross and took all of that. I took depression, anxiety, all of this on the cross so that you could so that I can understand what you go through. &gt;&gt; I could understand what it was like to have loss. So I can that's why he let Lazarus die &gt;&gt; so that he could understand grief and sadness and all these things. He let these things happen because he wanted to experience it but also show you that I'm the one that can overcome it all. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that can bring you to that point and bring you over that point. I can take you through it if you allow me to lead you and guide you straight through it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. But see, you got to have those backside of the desert experiences. You got to have that moment in time that you can point to and said, "I know when at my lowest moment, God was there." &gt;&gt; At my lowest and darkest moment, God was there. &gt;&gt; Who knows? Moses might have been like, "Is this the rest of my life? Is this all I'm supposed to do?" &gt;&gt; I always heard I was supposed to deliver them from the Egyptians, but now I'm 80 years old. He said, the prophet God said, he said, Moses, God determined cuz he elected him to do so. He wandered in the desert and one day on the back side of the desert, God decided to call his runaway prophet. He selected a certain tree. He said, I've always wondered, I wonder what he put on that tree that it didn't burn up. He said the leaves were popping and cracking the fire in the fire burning. And I don't know how long it burned, but it didn't burn. It was God's selected place to meet his prophet. Said many of times God have moments in your life where he wants to meet you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll have circumstances, situation in your life that he allow you to go through because it's a moment that he wants to meet you. He wants to speak to you. He wants you to go through it because there's something greater than than you in this moment. God wants to show you for it that he's able to do more than you thought he could do. &gt;&gt; He can bring you out of it. He can deliver you. He can set you free. He can allow you to overcome it. &gt;&gt; He said Moses comes on top of the mountain for those 40 days. He and he, if you go on down in the story, he said in the beginning when Moses when Moses met God in the burning bush, he was afraid to see God. But later on down in Moses' life after God and brought him over the Red Sea and all these many different things, he was in the mountain and he was getting the Ten Commandments and God said, "Do you do you want to see my face?" And Moses was he he wanted to see God. He wanted to see God. And and the prophet God said, "And Moses coming on the top of the mountain for these 40 days and he had been up there getting commandments and afterwards knew what it was to meet God, knowing what it was to have a conference of God. So he waited his 40 days. It was easy after he once had a conference with God. See, once you have a meeting with God one time, it's easier to wait on God for the second time because it's easier the third time because you realize that God will always show up on the scene. &gt;&gt; You realize that he won't ever leave you if you have a sincere desire to Lord, I have a need. &gt;&gt; I have a need in my life. Lord, I've gotten to this point that I don't want to go forward. I don't want to go back. But Lord, I need you to show up on the scene for me. Lord, I need I you you've done this before. You showed me this. But Lord, I have a need in this moment. Lord, I need to have a conference with you. Lord, I need to have another experience. It's good to have one experience, but you need to have more experiences. You need to continue to let your cup get full and full till your cup run over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes if you're really really really thirsty, one cup of water ain't good enough. &gt;&gt; One bottle of water ain't good enough. You need something. You want as much much liquid as you can to quench your thirst. But see, sometimes some people they they'll take the little sip and say, "You know what? I'm good." Cuz you know, they might be looking at the next person or this one or that one and say, "No, you know what? I'm good." But you know when you really are thirsty, you you don't necessarily care who was around when you drinking this water. You don't care how ugly it look. You don't care whether it's a few drops spilling cuz you trying to quench your thirst. And see when God comes to you sometimes you got to get to those moments say, "Lord, I'm thirsty." &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm thirsty and I need you to quench my thirst. Lord, I want you to come down and fill that desire that's in my hearts. Lord, I need you to come down and touch me in such a special and a mighty way that I know that you're still here with me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I've had the experience. I've been baptized. I've gotten saved. But Lord, I need more than that. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need something that you, as a song said, Lord, keep me day by day. I need the thing that's going to keep me day by day. I need the Holy Ghost inside of me that when that's going to stand up against the ws of the devil when the fiery darts come against me because the devil will never stop fighting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whe whether you whether you leave God or not, the devil ain't going to leave you alone. &gt;&gt; And I said it I I like to say I said how do how do you know that God loves you? I said when the devil is fighting you and you able to fight back, that means God is still there with you. the fact of the matter that you still have a conscience to know the difference between right and wrong. God is still here. When when you when you start to realize that every day that you wake up is a sign that God loves you. Every day that you able to go out and is a shine that God cares about you. Every accident that he spares you from. Every job that he allows you to keep each and every day. And you realize that God is able to do the things the simple things in life. You start to thank him no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you started to understand that these are the things that show you how real God is. These are the things that show you how blessed you are. These are the things that show you how how amazing God can be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need those back of the desert experiences, though. You need those moments where you cried out all night like Jacob did and you wrestle with that angel all night and all night and you said, "I'm not going to let go until you bless me." Cuz sometimes God wants to see how determined you are to get what he has for you. He wants to see what are you willing to give up to get what he has for you. Whether it be friends, whether it be family, whether it be money, whether it be houses, whether it be opportunities, whether it be businesses, he wants to know what you're willing to give up for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when Moses is is is very paramount when you go and you look at these stories and you realize it was only them and God there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't them and their family. It wasn't them and their friends. It wasn't them and all these different things. It was them and God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And see, sometimes you got to you got to steal the noise. You got to let all these things be and you got to get alone with God &gt;&gt; until it's just you and him &gt;&gt; and you can talk to God and God can talk to you. &gt;&gt; You can have a conversation with God and God can speak back to you and you can wait there until God does something that that you expecting God to do. &gt;&gt; Because it's it's in those moments that can change the rest of your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; See Moses after that moment he could go with confidence even though he told God all these many excuses. How many of us when we talking to God and God tell us to do something we have a lot of excuses. We we we come to God well I can't do that right now. Well God I don't have the money for that right now. Oh God I I don't have the I don't have the fortitude for that right now. Lord I'm not strong enough. Lord I'm I I I can't carry that load right now. I got so many other things that I'm carrying there. There's so many times when when God wants to do something, we have a lot of excuses to God why we can't do it. When God tell us to do something, we have a lot of excuses to God why we can't do it. And Moses came with his litany of excuses. He probably had been building them up. And and he said, "Well, God, you know, you know, I can't I can't I can't talk like that." Well, God said, "I'm going to send Aaron with you." And then God said, "You you don't even have to worry about speaking because it's not you, it's me that's going with you." &gt;&gt; And see, you got to understand when God tells you to do something, it's not because it's something that you are able or capable of doing. It's because he's going to be there right there with you. He's going to take you through it and give you every tool, everything that you need to to be to be able to do what he asked you to do. It doesn't matter what he takes you through. If he got something that he purposed for you to do, he's going to make sure that you got the tools and things to do it. If you look at the story of Joseph, you can see God each and every stop in Joseph's life was building him to one day save Egypt, &gt;&gt; to save his family. Even though you say, "Man, that's a horrible rough life right there." But nobody saw the end of Joseph's story but God. And when you understand that nobody knows the end of your story but God, you you don't have to question what the journey looks like cuz &gt;&gt; because you may never understand the journey that you want. &gt;&gt; You may not understand why you have to go through this and why this happened and why is this because there's some things I said sometimes God will put you in the right place just to save your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I thought about that and I said, you know, you can complain about a lot of things. My family, this, that, and the other. Why I ain't being treated right? All these things. But what if God put you there? Cuz he knew that's what you needed to save your soul. &gt;&gt; And I started to think about it. I said, all the things that you might go through, what if God allowed you to go through it just because it was the place that he wanted you to save your soul? &gt;&gt; He said, everything everything is put here for a purpose. Everything has a season. Everything was made because God made it and he made it well when he made it. So there wasn't nothing. He just allowed us. He gave us free will that we can make choices. But at the end of the day, he still knew the choices that you would make. And when he when he allowed you to be here, he still uh through all of that, he chose you. &gt;&gt; Even through all your ups and downs, he still chose you. Even through all your good and your bad, he still chose you. Even though even though he knew that you'd make the mistakes that you would, he still decided to choose you. He chose someone that was a murderer. &gt;&gt; That's what he did to Moses. &gt;&gt; But he still said, "You know what? You going to be the one that is going to deliver my people. You think that God didn't know he wasn't going to murder that Egyptian. He knew he would, but he still chose them. So it's not how good you are. It's not how perfect you are. It's not how righteous you live. It's only by the grace and the mercy of God that he chose you. [applause] And he chose his spirit in your life to show you and give you something to anchor you down to prove to you that I chose you. He gives you the Holy Ghost that you can overcome the world. He gives you these things. He gives that fire on the inside that you can overcome the world and prove to you that I chose you. He said that he said that only perfect love is going to enter there. But you can't have it if you don't have the Holy Ghost. You can't have it if you don't have the God inside of you. &gt;&gt; He said, "Men, whoever had a conference with God or women know what it means to forsake food sometimes, forsake water, forsake the things of the world, forsake everything else to come apart with God to hold a conference." He said, "Moses on this first conference, the burning bush, he received orders from God." He said, "I'm the God of your fathers, and I've heard the cries of my people, and I'm sending you down to deliver them. I want you to go down into Egypt." Look what simple reasons he used. And he said, Moses begins to make excuses, saying, "I'm not. I'm slow of speech and so forth." And he told him that he'd be with him and the angel God would go before him in signs and wonders and that he would do. So he was ready to go. Then see after your experience with God, you're ready to go wherever God sent you. &gt;&gt; See, after Moses experience, he wasn't he wasn't questioning God no more. Because he had had that experience with God in such a way that he was ready to go. He was ready to to be used by God. He was ready. He didn't know how it was going to happen or what was going to happen. He was just going to go because God told him to go. He was going to be led by the spirit and let God lead him because God had sent him. God had come down and vindicated what he wanted him to do in such a way that that he didn't have to worry about it anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thought about another one of the servants and it was I thought about David and and I thought about the story when he when Goliath came as a simple story and when Goliath came there was a lot of people that was more qualified to fight Goliath. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a lot of people that had been trained train trained up to fight Goliath. And and and prophet God said, he said, "Sure, who would tackle that great big giant if there was any man in the whole of Israelite army that should have been physically able would have been Saul." He said Saul was the king and the Bible said that he was head and shoulders above any man in his army. Not only that, he was well-trained man. He knew all the military maneuvers and he had been schooled since a boy of know how to handle a a spear or a sword, but he was afraid because the giant had him bluffed. I wonder how many times we come up on situations that have us bluffed. We run up on a situation that we become afraid of because it's a bluff. Even though it looks bigger than what it is, because we sometimes we we don't necessarily feel confident enough in in in fighting this this thing that we have we're facing. We don't feel the confidence enough to do it. But he goes on and he said, "But you know, God has always got somebody that's not scared. Way back on the back side of the desert hurting his paby sheep was a little old ruddy stoop shoulder boy that knows something about God. He wasn't a trained fighter but when he heard that giant make that expression he said do you mean to tell me that you'll stand here and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the living God? He said if you are if you are all scared let me go fight them. He said the most equipped man there was in the entire group. He was the most unequipped man in the entire group. But he had something that was greater than spears and shields. He had something that was greater than swords and spears. He had some he had an experience with God that he knew that you know what this isn't a battle between the Israelites and the Philistines. This is a this is a battle between God and the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every time the battle becomes God between God and the devil, God always wins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you start to get out of the view of the feeling this is Goliath and you and you this little small thing and realize this is a fight between God and the devil, you become with a different confidence because you can trust in God. &gt;&gt; You can depend on God. You can lean on God. You can stand firm on the word of God because you realize that the word of God always defeats the devil. [applause] &gt;&gt; See, once you on, you got to stop looking at the actual thing and see beneath the surface. You got to stop looking at what you see and look and look beyond what you seeing and what's under the surface and realizing that the battle is not yours, but it's the Lord's. See, David knew that he already had victory when he heard what the Philistines said. Amen. &gt;&gt; He already had the victory. He hadn't fought him. He hadn't walked that. They hadn't even questioned him yet. He already knew that God had defeated him &gt;&gt; because it wasn't a battle that he had to fight. He knew that God was going to prove that he was still the one and only true God. He was going to prove that there was nothing that can defeat me. There's nothing that can stand against me. There's nothing that can hold me back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter how well you you're trained, if you're not experienced, you he said you wouldn't want a doctor to operating in you that never had experience. You was his first patient." Certainly not. He said, "We need Christians who got experience, who knows how to trust God." &gt;&gt; And when David went up, they brought him before Saul. And Saul said, "Why you couldn't fight that man? why you're nothing but a little ruddy kid and you're just a youth and he's a warrior from his youth. But he said, "But Saul, there's there's just one thing you don't know. I've had an experience." &gt;&gt; He said, "Back on the back side of the desert one day, I was brought into a showdown. A lion run in and got one of my sheep and I knocked him down with a slingshot and he rose up against me and I killed him." He said he he didn't speak with, you know, questions in his words. He spoke with a definitive tone. &gt;&gt; He spoke with, you know what, these are these are things that I know happened. &gt;&gt; I un I I I didn't see somebody else tell me about it. God showed it to me and it happened. These things are something that I can point to and I can stand on. And he said, "And a bear got a kid and I killed him. And the God that delivered me out of the paws of the lion and the bear will deliver me out of the spear of that uncircumcised Philistine. He said, "The God that delivered me out of the paws of the lion and the bear will deliver me out of the spear of that uncircumcised Philistine." If you ever can look in your life and point to a time that God delivered you, then you always know that God is a deliverer. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So if he did it before, he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. As &gt;&gt; the songwriter said, he's the same God now as he was then. Amen. He said, and he knew what he was talking about. He didn't have much training, but he knew the God of heaven. And he didn't need any training. You don't need it if you know God. Said you don't need the training if you know God. Some people don't understand that why why you're able to do the things that you able to do or why you seem to go in positions that that you wasn't qualified for and you're still able to handle yourself because you don't need the training if you know God. See, God is able to give you the things that others may work hard for. God is able to bless you with things that other may try all their life for because you know God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he conquered the Philistine because God was with him. What he had an experience. Therefore, he had faith because he know what God had done. God could do again because he know what God had done. God could do again. And the crisis was on and God would act. I wonder today how many people are in crisis? &gt;&gt; How many people are in a crisis or facing something? Because he said here, the crisis was on and it's not for you to act, but it's for him to act. It's for him to show up on the scene and prove that he is God. It's for him to show up and say, "You know what? This situation is not about you. It's it's all about me coming down and showing you that I'm still here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, don't you see it? God is obligated to act every time. He's got to in order to be God. If if you just won't doubt him if you just won't doubt him. He must act in order to stay God. See, we get smarter. The generations makes us smarter. We learn the intelligence of our father. But God was infinite to begin with. &gt;&gt; He don't start getting any smarter. What he did the first time, he has to do every time because he was perfect to begin with. and his actions and his motives and his power and all that he was was perfect to start with. He don't need any schooling. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that you can go through that God hasn't already seen, hasn't already faced and hasn't already overcome. &gt;&gt; See, when he went to hell and he went and died on the cross, that was when he went to hell and death and he defeated hell and death in the grave. So, there was nothing there that could ever defeat him. There was nothing there that that would make you afraid because God is with you. If he said, "I promise to never leave you nor forsake you and and to and to always be there for you," then that's the God that's always there. If he was there before, he'll be there then. If he was there yesterday, he's there today. If he was there the day before that, he was there yesterday. If he was there the day before that and before that, he was there the second day ago and the yesterday and today and he'll be there tomorrow and he'll be there the day after that and he'll always be there because there's something that you can hold on that God is still real. God is still a healer. He's still a deliverer. He's still a provider. He's still everything that I need. See, I can point back to my experience with God and show forth that God is still there with me. And every now and again, I got to get back down and be reminded of what God has done for me. I got to be reminded of what he's brought me through. I got to be reminded of my backside of the desert experiences and point to it and say, "Lord, I still need you to show up one more time. Lord, I still need you to come down one more time. Lord, I need you to come down and show me and do the things once again, Lord. Lord, I need you to refill me and I need you to overflow me once more, Lord. Lord, I need you to give me extra strength, Lord. I need you to give me extra victory, Lord. I need you to give me a a greater heart's desire, Lord. Give me more of you that I I won't be afraid, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. I said too many people they get to this moment when God is trying to lead them lead them by themsel to have their experience and they want to bring other people along. &gt;&gt; And I asked the question I wrote down I said why are you afraid to be alone? &gt;&gt; Many of times nowadays many people struggle with many different things but why are you afraid to be alone? Sometime God has to get you by yourself. He got to get you there so that he can do do the work that he's been wanting to do in your life. He's been wanting to do something that you can have that experience that you can hold on to for the rest of your life that you can hold on to and say, "God, I know you did something for me. Lord, I don't I needed it and you came on the scene and you did it for me." I like something Brother Ernest, he always says. He said, he said, "Your rock bottom may not be my rock bottom, but each one of us will hit rock bottom." And when you hit rock bottom, you got to realize what you standing on. &gt;&gt; You got to have something that's greater than you to stand on. You got to have something that you can point to and said, "My faith looks up to thee." Said, "My" And see, you got to have something that you can point to like the songwriter said, "At the cross." At the cross where I first saw the light. See, that's all that we're trying to get you to understand that you got to have those experiences where you got to come to God and say, "Lord, I want you to take everything. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to give you up everything." And Lord, I promise you, God will do something in your life. I promise you, God will show up in your life, God, to do something that you can point to and say, "Lord, I knew at this time &gt;&gt; if I ever had any doubt in you, &gt;&gt; I I don't have no doubt no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I had anything that I question, I don't have those questions anymore. He's a question answering God. He He's a He's a God that'll show up on the scene. He's a God that'll deliver. He's a God that'll save. He's a God that are set free. &gt;&gt; My God don't ever stumble or fail to show up for me. &gt;&gt; He don't ever stumble or fail. He may not be when I want it, but he shows up right on time. Sometimes you just got to wait a little while. But God is still working behind the scenes. He's still doing the things that I can't even see. See, in those moments, I start to get thanking God because as the worse the trial gets, the I know that God is coming right soon. I know that he's right around the corner cuz the devil's fighting me harder. I He wouldn't be fighting me if it wasn't something that God's got for me. he wouldn't be fighting me as hard as he is if there isn't something that God has for me that's right around the corner and he's just trying to stop me from breaking through because he knows when I break through that the devil that I saw today I don't have to see no more see it's right there and sometimes we give up right when right at the edge of the breakthrough we give up right there but God is trying to tell you no press on press on keep fighting keep fighting keep fighting That thing that I did before, I'm showing you is still around right around the corner. I'm showing you that experience. It wasn't a one-time experience. It was an experience I'm going to give you over and over and over and over again. See, it's something that once you press through, there's something greater right around the corner. &gt;&gt; See, the devil wants you to believe that it's time to give up. He wants you to get to the point that you know what, I done as good as I can. This is good enough for me. But know there's something more that God wants to give. &gt;&gt; There's always more. If he said uh he owns the cattle on a thousand hills. There's always something more that God can give. I I told the story many times, but I'm reminded of the story. I said there was a story of a man. He he had went to he eventually ended up passing away and he gets to heaven and they take him past down this long hallway and they passing some rooms and he sees a door open. Then the room and and he and as he's passing the door this they the angel is leading him down the hallway and as he passing the door he sees this great room in one of the doorways and the angel reaches and it's full up with many different things. wonderful things, presents, all this type of stuff in there. Everything is shiny and glittery and all this type of stuff. And so when when he goes to it, the angel comes around him and steps around and shuts the door quickly. And when he shuts the door, he said he said, "Why you close the door?" And and the man asked asked the angel, "Why you close the door?" He said, "You don't want to know what was in that room." He said, he said, "What do you mean I don't want to know?" He said, "You don't want to know what was in that room." He said, "Let's just keep going." And so the man, he get he gets inquisitive. He said, "No, I want to know. I want to know what was in that room." And and and he starts to question. And the angel is like, "No, no, no. Let's just keep going, trying to, you know, trying to push him on along." But but you see this man, he he was determined to figure it out. So eventually he said, "You want to know?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "Okay, I'll tell you." And then he opens up the door and he sees the room and sees all these many wonderful things. He walks in there and wow wow all these things. And the angels he said what are all these things? Who do they belong to? Who who who were these things given to? He said and the angel said these were all the things God wanted to give you while you were on earth but you was never in the place to receive them. And many of times that's how God is. He He wants to give us more. He wants to give us more. He wants to give us more of his his anointing, more of his presence, more of these things, all these spiritual and wonderful gifts. And many of times we're not in the place to receive them. But you got to come down to the place of Lord, I get I've gotten to the place of Lord, whatever you have for me, I want to receive it. Whatever it takes for me to get there, Lord, I want to get there that I can receive what you have for me. I want to receive all the many spiritual and blessed gifts that you have for me. Everything that you promised me in your word, Lord, I want to receive it. Everything that you spoken about me, I want to receive it. I don't want nothing to lack cuz I know that you guys even greater for me over there. But while I'm here, I want to get everything that God has for me. I want to receive all these things because God, he has these things for me. So why shouldn't I take advantage of it? Why shouldn't I receive it? Because God has allowed me and given me these things. See, God has a way of showing up every time that you need them. And and even when some he has to do the things like he did from Moses to get your attention, he takes us all through these experiences. sometimes just to get your attention, to get your attention, to draw you away from the path that you was going. Moses might have been content to live his life in that desert. But God had a reason and a purpose for him that was greater than hurt and she cheek that was greater than what he was doing. And he had to do something to get his attention. See, and in that God getting his attention, Moses had an experience with God that he could testify of for the rest of his life. That he could testify of. David had that experience with God that he could testify of for the rest of his life. And it was a it was a foundation that he could stand on and said that I know that the God that brought me from the lion and the bear is the God that can deliver me from the Philistine. And Jesus when he when he got done in his moment, he got tested by the devil, but it was a proof to show us that the only way to defeat the devil was the word of God. &gt;&gt; And see, understanding that these experiences was something to show us that when when when you get to those moments in those places, God will show up on the scene. &gt;&gt; God will be right there with you. And God, if you cry out to him, he'll show up for you because he's the one. He's the author of our faith. And he's the beginning from the end. And he knew the end of the story. And he wouldn't allow you to get there without having a way to bring you through it. &gt;&gt; See, that's God and what he does for each and every one of us. He wants you to get there so that sometimes you can get the victory over what you're facing. But he can only get you. He can only do it when you get to that place. When you get to that moment and you get to that time which you're realizing that you want to give up and surrender all. Amen. Let us bow and let the musicians come. Lord, we heard your word this morning. Lord, we want to point to those experiences that we have with you. Lord, we understand that sometimes it takes us getting by ourselves, getting desperate, getting the alone with you, Lord, to hear you, to see you move in our lives.

Lord Jesus, we thank you for the hands that are lifted and the hearts that are open.

Something happened. Lord, something something is different. And Lord, I let them allow them to continue to grow in you and grow closer to you each and every day. There's someone else that say, you know, I I I've been saved, but you know, I want to take the next step. I want to be baptized in Jesus' name. And you haven't done that at this time. Would you lift your while every head is bowed and every eyes closed? Would you lift your hands? Amen. God bless you. Lord, you see the hands that are lifting the hearts that are open. Lord, we ask that you continue to lead in God and walk with them. And Lord, continue to touch them in a mighty and a special way and continue to work in their lives.
