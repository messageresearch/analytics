TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and God bless you I'm glad to be in the presence of God amen praise God and may I also greet you on behalf of my family and the church back home who are listening to us this evening the spoken word Tabernacle and to you I said God bless you thank you for praying for me in Saint Luke chapter 4 and verse 18. let me read from verse 16. and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and so stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet azzar and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of the sight of the blind and to set at Liberty them there are bruise to preach the acceptable year of the Lord says and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your years then over in Saint Luke Chapter 7 and verse 36 and one of the Pharisees desire him that he would eat with them and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees also brought in an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and begin to wash his feet with her tears and it wiped them with the hair of her head and kiss his feet and anoint them with the ointment now when the Pharisee which had been him saw it he spoke within himself I want you to know that he speak within himself saying this man if he were a prophet he would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touch him for she is a sinner may the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated you know I'd like to speak on setting the captive free setting the captive free you know there's passage of scripture is it's there and said Matthew it's also there in Mark and here Dr Luke also write about it and I'd like to say it's not a parable it is something that actually happened to the Lord Jesus that is something that they're known and the the gospel amen It Was Written there and here it was this woman amen as Luke said for she was a woman of the city and she was a sinner and here it is we talk about her and him in that day when she met Jesus but I'd like to go amen before this day when she meet Jesus you see I'd like to they may get down to the point because what is happening to us today it never started today I would like to look back at him and the kind of upbringing she could have had amen the kind of young girl him and she was amen you know I'd like to him and pray to pray to this evening and see if we can see ourselves in the light of the scripture remember the Bible said that women here she bought the assignment amen that was very costly and she came and she brought it to Jesus remember she was a sinner woman then we said what kind of woman she was amen what I brought her to this point they may not like to say that might be him and this young girl had grown up in a Christian home amen made a commitment but we were not committed amen is sad to say but it's just the truth maybe that many times they mean what we see on the street they mean it never started I'm in there on the skin row remember in many Christian homes in the refiner Hallelujah little children remember parents are amen somehow might be not knowing later they may be let down the bars we need to be careful how about the entrance and the great ways amen that we have set amen that sin amen and Spirits can enter into homes [Music] that we can and about many times I think they mean that we miss her spiritual discernment aiming our life they may never started where you saw it remembered from a guru bringing her remember something began to happen they made something Hallelujah begin to change within the framework of the home amen amen might be this girl maybe you look at a woman today and you said ah what a prostitute remember if you find out I'm an exact way that started they may not be the framework of the church they mean she was molested amen I've talked I'm sitting there in the office hey man I've talked to many young people amen many mothers today they meant somewhere within their lives amen they were torture inappropriately they mean something has happened they may have lost confidence they mean in the pastor they met many times women new parents are they mean the way you speak in your homes about the ministry name it about the preacher amen you criticize her and you condemn her even the children are picking up that spirit and tomorrow you can flip over like an hippocrator remember what you're saying they made us Edge in their mind living in US carve their consensus amen and it's gonna come to something tomorrow Hallelujah and we wonder sometimes anymore people hallelujah who are one sir hey man hold going and him and jovial and joyful amen they've come to a stage with her it seemed like they've lost the joy of their salvation they may have lost their days amen when they used to have joy in the word of God and then when they could trust one another they remember all that is gone amen why because something happened a young man a young girl who has turned to homosexuality then you trace that back somewhere amen and something happened amen that was a very nuclear of where they are today are you there with me not many things are going to be taboo amen but you might as well say Amen because I'm going to preach tonight Hallelujah and I'm gonna preach what God puts on my heart aiming to preacher amen it is sad to say and in that many who claim the Holy Ghost they may have walked out of the way of the word hallelujah and I've done things they may just power the Next Generation now they may not tell you I'm encourage her then when I see young people they may begin to testify you amen today of the goodness of God Amen many today maybe they're right there in church they can't praise the Lord they may they can't say amen amen because there's a conscience amen that is nearby sinner amen and every time they would have rise up amen the devil is right there to tell them and you can't praise the Lord you've got nothing to praise about her even because of what is in your life you'll find out today many young girls who have been scarred it's because of a Hunker a father and I'm sick with young people whose parents are our ministers Hallelujah but men Hallelujah follow their children and that power is right there and they saw Glory but he come to Center the captain free Hallelujah and then somebody would look at this young girl aiming that she began to change and said a no long time there was nothing in her but nobody tried to go back and to find out the cause nor may I say this to you women are young a woman standing aiming on the platform before the propheter amen she had a condition and then when you look at her he said I saw it I see you moving from me Hallelujah she was a little girl you're in a yellow dresser and there's a dog that is chasing you and the cause of that there's a spirit amen that is now on her that cause nervousness and heart trouble Hallelujah amen but now we look at the sins of men when a man molest a child the spirit of the Molester him and gets on that child and president I tell you no she becomes a captive to that spirit and it sees not delivered she's an agent of hell but yet this woman Hallelujah can I talk about her she came from the mind of God she was a Seed of Abraham the receiver of life amen that was inside of her then yet oh it's not God cause it to happen they remember the mere reflection amen of her life amen singing to the picture [Music] but I thank God that Jesus said he said none that the father gave to me shall be lost the way of the world today you you know in our country we're battling Amen to a great Crossroad Jamaica was always came in a great friend of the USA but now the government of the USA is setting a new ambassador to Jamaica and the government has got to approve the Ambassador with his spouse but his spouse is of the same sex and it's against our law and the government have failed they need to approve it and so the three ambassadors from Jamaica in the USA the government is sending them back home because as a nation we will not accept it said righteousness with its alternation but sin is a reporter to any people where did it start this young man who was coming up he was strong they remember he went around the wrong crowd and he was molested somehow no pressure let me say this to you when your children start to payment change character something happened somewhere it is a shame that's in a church people become hypocritical I know there was nothing good in them all along and your love that to flourish Hallelujah but Jesus came to set your captain free she will come of age no matter what happened she will never be the same again she might marry a husband but she cannot serve him right because there's a spirit in her life that is motivating her and the blindness of the ministry that led these things gone in the church Hallelujah remember I pray that we're going to see a church again we're gonna get back to a place where the Holy Ghost and the power of God is going to reign in our church and When sin come through the door amen somebody he's gonna stand up against it Hallelujah whole Church of the Living God it is time we take the holy ghost out of the back room and bring him back in the front room Hallelujah Glory Jesus and so it was Amen to begin to try to find a place in society and maybe you know deep inside of her heart may I say if you're a seed of God it doesn't matter what the devil does there's something in you that is called your back to the cross of Jesus there's a deep calling and for deep but by yourself the only way you can respond baby you've got to be delivered you've got to be released amen that stronghold of the devil amen is going to lose on you remember the preacher preacher amen they take all the quotes but there is no power so we get to the stage where what we want to hear is a favorite quote oh we all know them or favorite rhetoric and people die in their experience and the young people begin to move away they mean from the church they mean they don't trust anybody Hallelujah trust is lost and when trust is lost everything is gone am I talking to you am I preaching to you are you there with me put your neighbor and said I'm right there hallelujah hallelujah amen but here it is hallelujah was coming up amen she was rejected let me try they met you run away from Homer they make you tried somewhere they need to be in the church amen but she's rejected because of her life may I say he come to Center the captain free the Pharisees never wanted her around because she was a woman of the city and she was a sinner you know we've got so much Prejudice today Hallelujah we don't want the double married because it put pressure on our church we don't want the mixed marriage he put pressure on our church or church don't look good Oh Glory to God somebody Hello we've got so many prejudices tell me that somebody amen because of their socialization they are tattooed all over we cast them as a child of Hell amen because their peers are all over we have nothing to do with them but Jesus he never come to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance [Music] Hallelujah Glory amen may I say you would want this woman in your church the woman of Samaria you wouldn't want to turn your character because she's married five times we want to mechanically put a church together that looks good to the world that look good to the sister church that look good to everybody while the son The Sinner die in their sin he's a writer Hallelujah but if you are not a sinner you don't need a savior if you're a Seeker you don't need no physician he's a writer Hallelujah but Jesus but Jesus but Jesus for Jesus but Jesus he come to seek and to save them that are lost Hallelujah amen until right there in the framework of the church the devil's got ancients that he has bound and because sin is not preached amen listen if you want to get rid of a demon in your life expose him hello but people become afraid to say exactly where they live and what the devil has done in their lives because if you ever know you marginalize them oh Hallelujah somebody did you hear me you marginalizing you separate them Hallelujah you let them feel that there is no way that they could have Redemption remember I want to tell you this evening I thank God Amen when God called me he never called me because I'm righteous he never called me because I'm right he called me because before the foundation of the world he knew me Hallelujah glory to God it's not because of what I did but it's because of what he did on Mount Calvary oh Hallelujah [Music] Church I've seen young people who you know the church says well there's nothing good in them but when you try to reach them and to go back to the source of where their problem lies it was because daddy did something and Mama cover it up because had it been known he would have destroyed the entire family or something happened in a church and what the church does is cover the sin because of the sin is known it's going to destroy the church amen but I'll tell you as a children of god let's not hide sin and somebody need to be delivered Hallelujah amen and may I remind you of righteous tonight your story never

where if somebody's Bound by sinner they're afraid to speak because if they Satan there is not a brother they need to put his hand on your shoulder and said brother let me pray with you let me fight with you but no we tell it to everybody Read All About It oh Hallelujah read all about it are you there with me and so because of that sin reign Hallelujah but may I say this tonight in the message while Christ speak he said no church no matter all intellectual it is or fundamental that church cannot strive until the supernatural is made known among the people we've come to the stage where have you got the Holy Ghost it is all an intellectual conception Hallelujah somebody all you believe Brother Brazil is a prophet oh you've got the Holy Ghost hello hope we don't pray true oh Hallelujah

and he said right to the the front in front of me and I began to teach the statue of a perfect man and all that man rejoice I know he was it from our Circle but he was rejoicing of what he saw Hallelujah and the pastor he felt so on his that a woman and a pair of pants fitting in the congregation he went around and he got his wife and they took her out of the building and the next time I saw them coming back in she had on a dress and they seated her down and in their heart their feet lower that our church is Worthy because in the man A woman can't sit in our church dressed like that

because of the syndrome of God Amen that is in the heart and they would believe it and they are waiting on you who have already received it they made the hop on the door and let them hear amen that God has sent her a senate Angel Messenger on the face of the earth into a bright age feature that's something hey man Hallelujah glory to God but I'll tell you we come through many systems it was one time Brother Joseph when what we heard was the acts of the prophet and neglect the message and now we said ah we've gotten into the message the opening of the word here's the rod but we build another camp it's all right Hollywood would shut the door to others amen I was very encouraged for me to go to a church amen that is not a message or it's the first time I did that in America him and preached the gospel here's a rod amen but I believe that there are some seeds aiming among the Jehovah's Witness I believe there are some seeds in The Seventh-Day Adventists I believe there are some seeds in the Church of God of Prophecy hallelujah amen that never know that God sent a prophet remember when we speak to them we sell them they mean about a prophet that they don't know about her remember I challenge you Minister stanata if you can't preach this messenger out of the Bible the doctrine amen of what we believe Amy you've never met the pillar of fire are you throwing me here because brother Branham is not the essential woman of what we believe it is Jesus Christ amen what the message did to me is turn my heart back to the word of God and shine a light on the word of God hallelujah that the word that's on the page step out of the page and live into a body [Music] he was not the Christ he was not this son of man but he is a cinnamon revealing this other man Jesus Christ but I thank
