touch heal and deliver may you saved and set free filled with your spirit and your power may your love be multiplied and may the name of Jesus Christ be glorified May oh God you oh God move here this morning Lord and Lord we can all say it was good for us to be here so father in jesus' name we thank you commit the service in the word of Grace into your hands thank you Lord amen Genesis 25 and 21 I read the first you'll read the next and we read the latter verse together Genesis 25 and 21 and is it entreated the Lord for his wife because she was burn and the Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceeded 22 and the Lord said un unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separate from thy vow vows and the one people shall be stronger than the other people [Music] and the one people should be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger 24 and the first came out red all over like in hary garment and they called his name Esau 26 and the boys grew and Esau was a conning Hunter a a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents 28 and Jacob saw partage and Esau came from the field and W and he was faint dir and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright 32 and Jacob said swear to me this day and he sweared unto him and he s sold his his Birthright un Jacob 34 together and Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage and lenon and he did eat and drank and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright God bless the reading this word you may be seated so this morning we want to talk concerning Birthright Birthright and then talking about Birthright we want to understand what the birthright meant because uh often times uh people despise their Birthright now the birthright because of the Elder son let's just go to Deuteronomy for a minute Deuteronomy 21 and 15 Deuteronomy 21:15 the birthright gave them supreme authority mean preeminence and Authority 21 15 okay Caleb you got it okay if a man had two wives and one beloved and another hated and they have borne him children both the Beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be her hers that was hated then if it shall be when he maketh his son to inherit that which he has that he may not make the son of the Beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a what a double portion of all that he has for he is the beginning of his strength and the right of the firstborn is his are you with me so the birth right in today we talking about the birthright uh and it's a type of the Holy Ghost baptism are y'all with me the the type of the Holy Ghost baptism Birthright and that birth right uh gives you preeminence and authority and also gives you a double portion are you with me now I might have to cut the Heats off I see people Fanning so the devil portion are you with me now if you know you was going to get inheritance and you can get a double portion then you perhaps will respect and not despise not re you would hold on to your Birthright because it means something to you not only did the birthright means that uh it's something that you can hold on to but it also has the tendency our spiritual inheritance also so by the grace of God that which is spiritual uh you get a chance but uh Romans 9 here for a moment Romans n Romans n a lot often times people don't want they don't they desp they reject the opportunity to have the birthright that God wants to give you Esau didn't care too much about it why because Esau was hungry and he wanted what he he wanted right then I want I'm hungry right now this Birthright don't mean nothing I'm hungry now and I might die right now to give me Jacob said okay I but I want you to give me your Birthright Jacob meant deceiver and I'm going to tell you something your Jacob your Esau your Esau is your flesh Jacob is that Soul down that desire to please God spiritual man Esau is the carnal man man fleshly man are you with me your fleshly wants everything now what you can see what it it is are the worldly stuff that's what they want don't care nothing about heaven other the spiritual things they they're concerned about right now what I can get now what I want now this is your flesh walls against the spirit these two Nations they were battling in the womb two Nations and because Esau came out first he had the right to The Inheritance are you with me so let's look at Romans 9 and let's just pick pick it up at the seventh verse so we could read the whole chapter uh sth verse it says neither because they are Seed of Abraham are they all what but he said in I it shall thy what thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are what you know there's a there's an Esau church and there's a uh Jacob Church there's a church natural and there's a church spiritual amen two groups same Mama same daddy same blood parents was holy the blood was pure but yet it came out with two different Nation natures two n n nations are you with me so brother and sister I want you to look at what's going on these two uh nations in this womb she didn't know what's going on God revealed to her what's going on they were fighting prophet of God said they were fighting in the womb amen what was the fight all about who gonna get out first are you with me so there was a struggle so much and so when it came out uh Jacob was holding on to to Esau heel are you with come wait a minute are you with me so God was he uh for seeing some things already brother and sister Jacob wanted it Esau beat him to the punch Esau came out first but Jacob hell on this hill man I want it okay see things was going on in the spiritual realm 9 and S it says okay the eth verse says that is they which are children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the what promise accounted for the sea are you with me for this is for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceeded by one even by Our Father Isaac now we know it was ishma and you know and Isaac and so forth Ishmael seemed to be what the first born by the okay and it was Isaac are you with me so you always had these two these two uh coming one the natural one the spiritual one the flesh one the spirit are you with me the 11th verse says for the children being not yet what born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to that's what it's all about brother according to what according to election might stand I'm going tell you something election means something you God's grace upon you is about election now it's not what you've done it's not what you can do God by full knowledge knowing who you were before you were ever conceited in your mother's womb God already forew you you know your ups and your downs and your twists and your turns he knew what you were going to believe and what you were going to doubt am he knew whether you receive him or whether you would not and I'm saying brother and sister amen if you are a child of God by election amen you amen would take heed and you would want to serve the Lord but if you were not elected then you don't want nothing to do with it you don't you despise your Birthright you ah this ain't for me it ain't for me but the on that are elected they know that this word amen Jesus Christ died for my sin him dying means something to Meen him Rising the third day mean something to me the blood of Jesus mean that my sins are forgiven it means something to me but it don't mean mean nothing to the C of Mind of the worldly person they they the blood of Jesus it don't mean the church go amen they don't care about election they care about religion and going to church and just worship and going through the motion they don't care nothing about the birthright they don't want the Holy Ghost they want to go to church and go through the motion but that's for the Holy Ghost they don't want it the Holy Ghost is your Birthright I I'm not just going to say well I accept you as my personal savior I want more than that I I want more than just being a caral church believer the church natural I and the church spiritual so I want more what a double portion I I want my birth right some down inside them hunger and thirst whatever I got to do to get it I want it amen Church natural I I pay my ti pay my offering I come to church I do what Pastor ask me to do whatever go to the m Church natural but the church spiritually Jacob I want more than that praise God I want my Birthright I I want the Holy Ghost I want the power of God in my life I got to have it amen if he want me to have at church National he give it to me whatever God got for me it is for me and he want me to have it that he know where I live he know my heart he know my desires God knows all about me so he want me to have the Holy Ghost then then Lord you know you got my number you can call me up if you want me to have it now Jacob wasn't laid back he wanted the birth right whatever I got to do to get it I'm going get it Esau had it he was supposed to be the one to get all the The Inheritance the double potion and all he supp get he was the first born but the Bible say he despised his what he despised that many people come to church but they despise their Birthright what it means to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what it means to have the power of God to have authority in power oh yes I want that Authority I want that power in my name you'll cast out Devils you lay hands on the SAT they shall recover oh God I want it I want Power in my life amen I said well you know I'm saved that's enough I'm a Christian that's enough that's all I want if I can just badly get in I just want to make it in that those others that hungry and thirst on the inside deep called to the Deep the church spiritual amen Jacob I want it he says that the purpose of God according to the election might stand not of him that what work workers amen I do this I do that I do this I do that that don't make you elect I done this look at what what Jacob uh uh Esau did made parties his father loving this and that all that Jacob he couldn't probably with no Hunter couldn't do those things that Esau could do amen stayed around the house mama boy are you with me what even though amen all these works that we do but he still despised his Birthright pay my ti pay my off and work hard in the church and all of that the Holy Ghost ain't trying to get it don't want it no power I do this I did this and I did that not to works not what you done not all your works oh you can brag on yourself about all your works and what all you do and what all you done for the Lord and they going to come in that day say Lord Lord then I do many works in your name cast out devils and I did this and that and God said depart from me your work is over n I don't know you because this thing is not because of what you done it's not because of your works not because what you done it's because what he's done on now he saved me
