[34:41] many love the Lord tonight come on that
[34:44] that's a beautiful name to say it's the
[34:47] sweetest name that can come off of our
[34:49] tongue and off our lips the name of
[34:51] Jesus Christ uh because that name
[34:54] includes so many things if you need a
[34:56] Healer Jesus Christ is your healer uh if
[34:59] you need a savior you have to recognize
[35:02] that you lost you need saving uh guess
[35:04] what Jesus Christ could be your savior
[35:07] um in a time where people's minds are
[35:09] scattered and they don't seem like
[35:11] they're on a firm foundation what I
[35:13] found is that the name of Jesus Christ
[35:15] is a very firm foundation for his people
[35:18] uh so Buddha can't do that for you uh
[35:21] confucious can't do that for you but
[35:23] it's something about the name of Jesus
[35:25] Christ and the whole reason we come out
[35:28] tonight is because we are believers in
[35:30] the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[35:33] we never lose focus of that how many
[35:35] love the Lord tonight oh God how many
[35:37] love the Lord tonight amen how many glad
[35:40] to be in the house of the Lord on a

[41:11] myself and carry it away but what it's
[41:13] talking about is your position in Christ
[41:15] amen amen and it reads it says the steps
[41:19] of a good man are ordered by the Lord

[41:27] and guess what the Lord does with that
[41:29] and he delighteth in his way Romans 8:28
[41:34] if we can read that together it's maybe
[41:37] one of the most powerful scriptures amen
[41:39] that Paul put together on a long list of
[41:41] powerful
[41:42] scriptures Romans
[41:46] 8:28 and I know you know it by heart
[41:49] amen but nevertheless we'll read it
[41:50] tonight and it says and we know amen oh

[42:24] 27 and8
[42:28] amen back home we was dealing with a A
[42:31] series at the beginning of the year on
[42:32] the book of Acts and just to show that
[42:35] the same God that operated in that
[42:38] church amen in the book of Acts amen by
[42:40] the power of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ
[42:42] was Gone In the Flesh they wonder what
[42:44] they were going to do but God never
[42:46] leaves his people without an answer so
[42:49] he answered by the Holy Ghost and it was
[42:50] a lot of things that they had overcome
[42:52] and it goes into the story of Paul and
[42:54] Paul has his ups and downs but
[42:56] eventually Paul has a great trial where
[42:59] he has to go before Caesar because the
[43:01] Jews hated him and they had him arrested
[43:03] and in the midst of him going from
[43:05] Jerusalem all the way to Rome Italy he
[43:08] boards a ship and the ship runs into
[43:10] some trouble along the way man how many
[43:13] know that we're on a journey and
[43:15] sometimes on this journey we run into
[43:17] some trouble along the way I I want to
[43:20] deal with a little portion of of what
[43:22] Paul had to go through and maybe you
[43:24] could see some tipes within your own
[43:26] life tonight
[43:29] amen acts 27:18 amen what happened they
[43:32] ran up a storm and it was a very
[43:34] terrible
[43:35] storm and it says and we being
[43:37] exceedingly tossed with a tempest the
[43:40] next day they lighten the ship they
[43:41] started throwing stuff overboard cuz the
[43:43] storm was so bad and in the third day we
[43:45] cast out with our own hands the tackling
[43:48] of the ship and when neither Sun not
[43:51] stars in many days appeared now this
[43:54] ain't no regular storm now they couldn't
[43:56] even see the sun of the
[43:58] storms but it said and many days appear
[44:01] and no small Tempest lay on us all hope
[44:04] that we should be saved was then taken
[44:07] away how many know the devil wants to
[44:09] take away your hope amen 21st verse and
[44:12] it says but after long abstinence Paul
[44:15] stood forth in the midst of them and
[44:17] said sir you should have hearkened unto
[44:19] me and should not have loose from CRE
[44:21] and to have gained this harm and lost
[44:23] Paul told him not to make that journey
[44:24] in the first place but it did it anyway
[44:26] but yeah some good news for them and now
[44:29] I exort you to be of good sheer for
[44:33] there shall be no loss of any man's life
[44:36] among you but of the ship for there
[44:39] stood by me this night the angel of God
[44:43] whose I am and whom I serve saying fear
[44:46] not Paul yes I'm going tell y'all
[44:48] tonight bride Tabernacle fear not amen
[44:51] thou must be brought before Cesar and lo
[44:54] God has given thee all them that s with
[44:58] thee wherefor s be of good cheer for I
[45:03] believe God how many believe God tonight
[45:06] that it shall be even as it was told me
[45:10] let's just skip down to the 42nd verse
[45:12] you can see what the summation of the
[45:14] story was amen hallelujah the
[45:17] Shipwrecked amen and the soldiers
[45:19] because there was some prisoners on
[45:21] board they wanted to kill those uh those
[45:23] prisoners in 42nd verse the reason the
[45:26] soldiers count was to kill the prisoners
[45:28] lest any of them should swim out and
[45:30] Escape but the Centurion willing to save
[45:33] Paul kept them from their purpose and
[45:36] commanded that they which could swim
[45:38] should cast themselves first into the
[45:41] sea and get to land and the rest some on
[45:45] boards and some on broken pieces of the
[45:51] ship and so it came to pass that they
[45:55] escaped all safe to
[45:59] land I was looking at the means of
[46:02] Escape that some was able to swim some
[46:05] was able to make it out on nice pretty
[46:07] boards but it was some that just had to
[46:10] hold on to some broken pieces of the
[46:12] ship and nevertheless if God ordained
[46:15] that way for them he was going to
[46:18] guarantee that they were going to be
[46:19] safe uh my title for tonight just for a
[46:22] few minutes of your time is going to be
[46:24] ordained broken pieces
[46:27] ordain broken pieces let's just bow our

[47:42] we serve is always in control am it it
[47:44] don't matter if your body is getting

[47:55] your church it doesn't matter if there's
[47:57] confusing situations going on we serve a
[48:00] god that is a
[48:02] mastermind and one thing that we've
[48:04] learned about that we see through
[48:06] experience that he is always in control
[48:10] he knows everything that is going on
[48:12] Amen and whether it's good things or bad
[48:15] things whether it's mountains that
[48:17] you're dealing with or valleys that
[48:19] you're dealing with those things can be
[48:22] rough sometimes Saints but I want to

[48:27] his Glory Hallelujah your life is a
[48:31] living manifestation of the glory of God
[48:34] when you get knocked down and you get

[48:39] yourself but it's giving glory to there
[48:42] the god that is on the throne and
[48:45] greater is the god that is within you
[48:47] than he that is in the world amen amen

[49:41] circumstance it brings you out to church
[49:43] on a Friday night even though you done
[49:45] worked all week long and then you'll
[49:47] come back out again on Sunday because

[49:59] man amen are ordered amen not of

[50:06] know but ordered by the Lord amen and
[50:09] whatever the Lord does is perfect and is
[50:12] perfect within his order so Saints what
[50:15] those things do is that they give us a
[50:17] certain amount of Peace within your
[50:20] trial amen what it does is it give you
[50:23] strength along your journey and the
[50:25] Bible says that almighty God he
[50:28] delighteth in those things amen amen
[50:31] sometimes it don't seem like there's any
[50:32] glory in those things but those things
[50:35] are a delight to almighty God Amen now
[50:39] Paul had to deal with something after
[50:42] all of the things that he did and all of
[50:44] the things that he overcome Paul had to
[50:46] deal with something called a shipwreck
[50:49] amen glory to God am amen Paul he had
[50:53] his experiences y all read his
[50:55] experiences with we know about his
[50:57] lifestyle as Saul but he was big time
[50:59] the scripture says that he was a
[51:00] Pharisee of the Pharisees he was of The
[51:03] Tribe of Benjamin of the stock of Israel
[51:05] amen Paul thought he was a big time man
[51:08] amen and in the midst of all of that
[51:11] when he had those religious demons on
[51:14] them cuz how many know the worst type of
[51:16] demon to get rid of is a religious demon
[51:19] am a self-righteous spirit that I got it
[51:22] all figured out I got it all under
[51:24] control and that's what SA have when he
[51:27] was still sof amen
[51:30] amen but God did something for him that
[51:33] he does for all of us amen he had a
[51:35] oneone face Toof face experience with

[51:54] change your life but so much but you
[51:57] come into the presence of almighty God
[52:00] amen amen it'll be the greatest thing
[52:02] that'll ever change your life amen amen
[52:05] amen amen hallelujah yes Lord Paul he
[52:09] came into the presence of Jesus Christ
[52:11] amen hallelujah and he moved on from
[52:13] them and almighty God fulfilled the
[52:16] promise unto him filled with the Holy
[52:18] Ghost amen and he goes all over the area
[52:21] preaching the gospel amen and preaching
[52:23] the Gentiles amen and trying to
[52:25] straighten out the Jews and and
[52:28] baptizing others amen amen he's
[52:31] straightening out the church left and
[52:32] right amen making them uh Christians
[52:36] instead of being Jews amen amen
[52:38] scripture even says that one day he with
[52:41] stood Peter to the face amen glory to
[52:43] God lord anointing him to write letters
[52:47] amen anoint him to write letters that we
[52:50] reading even to this day amen giving us
[52:53] strength to let us know what's going on
[52:55] letting us know about an adop
[52:56] let us know about a Rapture letting us
[52:58] know how to treat our wives and treat
[53:00] our families let us to this day that
[53:02] give us
[53:03] strength that was straighten out the God
[53:06] Head amen and in the midst of Paul doing
[53:09] all of these things
[53:11] Saints the Mighty God that sits on the
[53:14] throne let him get into a
[53:16] shipwreck now I would have thought a man
[53:19] that was doing more for God than almost
[53:22] any man up until that point amen I would
[53:24] think that that man would be a man that
[53:27] was taking care but nevertheless
[53:30] almighty God allowed him to get into a
[53:32] shipwreck sa the Shipwreck was so bad
[53:35] when you read the story in the book of
[53:36] Acts it lasted for 14 days the storm did
[53:40] uhh it blotted out the sun they couldn't
[53:43] even see the stars they had to throw
[53:45] everything overboard
[53:49] amen prophet of God brother brand he
[53:51] said even them salty Sailors that was on
[53:53] the ship and then seen a lot of Storms
[53:56] and a lot of challenges even then they
[53:57] got
[53:59] scared come on the Bible says look like
[54:01] all hope was gone hallelujah
[54:06] amen and the reason why I talk about
[54:08] those things tonight Saints is sometimes
[54:11] we get into shipwrecks amen amen amen
[54:15] sometimes we get into
[54:17] trouble sometimes we get into things
[54:20] that we don't understand and those
[54:23] things happen to try to shake your face
[54:26] am to make you think that God is giving
[54:29] up on you Hallelujah but I want to
[54:32] remind you tonight that your footsteps
[54:35] are ordered and every circumstance
[54:38] almighty God has an ordained way to
[54:41] bring you out
[54:43] Hallelujah glory to God sometimes we
[54:46] talk about an ordination like it's just
[54:48] for the ministry a ordain you to preach
[54:51] amen yes that's ordination but Jesus
[54:54] Christ has ordained all of you to be
[54:56] believer in this hour amen you got a
[54:58] commission you got a ministry as well
[55:01] and if God has the one that has ordained
[55:04] you that he has to be the one that's
[55:06] going to see you through amen amen amen
[55:14] amen sometimes we get in the shipwrecks
[55:16] amen amen sometimes Saints we have to
[55:20] remind ourselves that we are not on a
[55:23] cruise
[55:24] amen this is not a cruise
[55:26] amen this is a tedious Journey amen now
[55:30] we going to a cruise amen but right now
[55:32] on this Earth amen it's some bumps and
[55:35] there some ups and there some Downs
[55:37] there some scrapes there some some
[55:40] surprises amen even some rexs
[55:43] amen but through it all the scripture
[55:45] says this we know amen not this that we
[55:49] heard not this that I read in a book but
[55:51] this we know that all things work
[55:55] together for the good amen amen and when
[55:58] we get to the point where we really take
[56:00] a hold of that thing it it changes our
[56:03] entire walk as believer amen things that
[56:06] would have bother you when you had that
[56:07] short Temp and that short fuse it don't
[56:10] bother you anymore amen if you would
[56:12] have fussed at your wife over the
[56:14] smallest thing amen once you know that
[56:16] all things work together saints that
[56:18] have cut down on the fussing from the
[56:20] brothers it will help the sisters Amen
[56:23] to be patient with their husband and the
[56:25] father leadership that almighty God has
[56:28] given them amen and the divine order
[56:30] that God has given them because you know
[56:32] that all things work together if you got
[56:35] children that you worried about all
[56:37] things work together if the DCT that
[56:39] keeps giving you bad reports after bad
[56:42] report your testimony still should be
[56:45] that all things work together Hallelujah
[56:49] I'm not an English major but I know that
[56:51] the word all doesn't leave some things
[56:54] out amen the word all it does doesn't
[56:56] leave out the hard things it it doesn't
[56:58] leave out the confusing things but the
[57:01] word All Saints it means all and if God
[57:04] promised that it's going to work
[57:06] together I know nothing else than to
[57:08] tell you to trust him and believe in him
[57:11] when the Bible tells you that all things
[57:14] work together grab a hold of that
[57:19] promise
[57:21] amen amen let that be like Samson amen
[57:25] let that be your Jawbone of ass amen
[57:28] that you can use to beat down a thousand
[57:31] Devils amen and a thousand demons
[57:35] Hallelujah all things work together Lord
[57:39] amen to your name Jesus amen You Know
[57:42] The Enemy did not like what Paul and him
[57:44] was doing amen he never liked his
[57:47] ministry cuz his ministry was tearing
[57:49] his kingdom down amen he didn't like his
[57:52] ministry because his ministry was going
[57:54] to bring an impact to the Saints of this
[57:57] day amen and sometimes when people talk
[57:59] about the message of hour they try to
[58:00] treat it as this new thing amen all the
[58:03] message did was to bring us back to what
[58:05] Paul and them was doing amen all it did
[58:08] was turn our hearts back to that same
[58:11] Faith the same faith of the fathers amen
[58:15] and here the enemy is trying to attack
[58:18] this man by the name of Paul Accord to
[58:20] God and the enemy trying to drown him
[58:24] amen but what we have have to understand
[58:27] if there was a wreck that Paul was in
[58:31] Hallelujah that means that God had to
[58:34] cause the
[58:35] wreck and if God is the one that cause
[58:38] the wck saints that means that God is
[58:41] going to have to take care of you within
[58:43] the
[58:44] wreck he can't cause the wreck and then
[58:47] turn around and let you drown amen and
[58:49] let the enemy get the victory know if
[58:52] the wreck happened God allowed it to
[58:55] happen amen and he was going to allow a
[58:57] way to escape amen one thing you have to
[59:00] remember about the program of God is
[59:03] that God always Hallelujah not sometimes
[59:07] not maybe but he always make a way of
[59:10] escape from Genesis to Revelation he
[59:14] makes a way of Escape all the way back
[59:17] in the Garden of Eden when they got out
[59:19] of line God still made a way of Escape
[59:23] all the way in the Book of Revelation
[59:26] amen when the scripture starts to open
[59:27] up them Seven Seals amen and the enemy
[59:30] looking like he about to get victory
[59:31] over the people of God there was a way
[59:34] of Escape that was provided and the Plan
[59:36] of Redemption was laid out because God
[59:39] is always in the business of making a
[59:42] way hallelujah amen and the scripture
[59:45] says when this ship wrecked it was some
[59:48] that they was some strong sers amen
[59:50] glory to God that's a tongue twister
[59:53] they were strong swimmers amen
[59:56] and they could swim their way on out
[59:58] hallelujah praise God I thank God for
[1:00:00] the strong swimmers amen then it was
[1:00:03] some they had a fancy away it said that
[1:00:06] there was some boards there and they was
[1:00:08] able to find this nice piece of board
[1:00:11] that was cut out they could grab a hole
[1:00:13] to the board and the board provided
[1:00:16] their way of Escape now remember Paul
[1:00:18] was already told that not a one of them
[1:00:20] would be lost it was 276 people aboard
[1:00:24] this ship 14 days storm not a one was
[1:00:27] lost because they were pre-ordained amen
[1:00:30] amen some swam the way out some caught a
[1:00:33] whole of a board and the scripture says
[1:00:36] some just caught a hold of a broken
[1:00:41] piece and I read that and I start to
[1:00:43] think I said Lord a broken piece what
[1:00:45] what does that even
[1:00:47] mean on maybe a handle broke off
[1:00:50] somewhere somebody was just able to grab
[1:00:53] that amen maybe it was a piece of a door
[1:00:55] Flo by amen and somebody was able to
[1:00:58] drap themselves overneath that door amen
[1:01:01] may it was a piece of the MK or
[1:01:03] something and somebody was just about to
[1:01:04] sink and they looked up and as they saw
[1:01:07] that piece of MK going by they was able
[1:01:09] to put out a hand on it and it was able
[1:01:12] to carry them safely to their
[1:01:15] destination glory to God see Saints
[1:01:19] sometimes we can only catch a whole of a
[1:01:22] broken piece every now and then but what
[1:01:24] I want you to understand is that if God
[1:01:27] has ordained that broken piece even that
[1:01:31] broken piece will get you to the shore
[1:01:33] glory to God
[1:01:36] hallelujah God has blessed us with the
[1:01:38] greatest message to ever hit the face of
[1:01:40] the Earth amen It's Made Men good
[1:01:43] husbands it's made wives good wives it's
[1:01:47] cleaned up the lives of teenagers it
[1:01:50] took self-righteous people and by God's
[1:01:52] grace it made them humble amen it opened
[1:01:55] up Mysteries of the end time and now the
[1:01:58] Book of Revelation is not a sealed book
[1:02:01] to us anymore even though it's a book of
[1:02:03] symbols we got to understand of what
[1:02:05] those symbols mean God has blessed us
[1:02:08] with a lot of things to be able to swim
[1:02:10] to the shore but sometimes everybody
[1:02:13] can't grab a hold of everything but what
[1:02:15] I want you to be able to grab a hold of
[1:02:18] is a broken piece every now and then
[1:02:21] amen now a broken piece for you might be
[1:02:24] a scripture as simple as by his
[1:02:29] stripes I am
[1:02:31] healed you might not be able to quote
[1:02:34] the seals book amen you might not be
[1:02:36] able to name the church ages in order
[1:02:39] but if you are sick you can grab a hold
[1:02:42] to a piece and that peace might not look
[1:02:45] like much but Paul said even the
[1:02:49] smallest pieace was going to be enough
[1:02:51] to take them all the way to the
[1:02:54] shore GL to
[1:02:59] God this is a time where if you got a
[1:03:03] little bit of peace in your life the
[1:03:06] devil will come in and he'll try to take
[1:03:08] away all of your peace amen am soon as
[1:03:12] the job get going good boss start
[1:03:14] cutting up they trying to lay people off
[1:03:17] amen see like the wife doing good then
[1:03:19] the kids start cutting up then the kids
[1:03:21] doing good the husband start cutting up
[1:03:24] next thing you know everything long spoo
[1:03:26] then this brother get on your nerves in
[1:03:28] the church and that sister leave you out
[1:03:30] when it's time to invite people to this
[1:03:32] party and and it's always something that
[1:03:34] we're dealing
[1:03:35] withen enemy always trying to take your
[1:03:38] peace amen GL to God but in the midst of
[1:03:41] all that you can grab a whole of a piece
[1:03:42] of the word amen that say he will keep
[1:03:45] you in perfect
[1:03:47] peace if you keep your mind stayed on
[1:03:50] him amen amen amen for he trusteth in
[1:03:54] thee amen amen since all of this word
[1:03:57] that we've been getting and all this
[1:03:59] word that we've been feeding upon is not
[1:04:01] for any type of reason but it's to get
[1:04:04] you all the way to the shore amen you
[1:04:08] got a
[1:04:09] predestinated appointment
[1:04:12] amen hallelujah I like that word
[1:04:14] predestination amen glory to God Propet
[1:04:17] of God he broke that down Amen to let us
[1:04:19] know that your footsteps are order that
[1:04:21] your
[1:04:23] destination is already determined
[1:04:27] now we know you put that in the wrong
[1:04:28] hands my destination is determined that
[1:04:30] I'm going go flying down I77 as fast as
[1:04:33] I want to go Hallelujah we know that God
[1:04:36] don't put that type of spirit in the
[1:04:37] belief
[1:04:38] amen but what predestination should do
[1:04:41] for you is it shall remind you how much
[1:04:44] God loves you and it should remind you
[1:04:47] in the midst of every bow and every test
[1:04:49] and every trial that there is a God that
[1:04:53] is taking care of you amen and so when
[1:04:56] the enemy is trying to condemn you you
[1:04:58] can hold on to a piece of the word where
[1:05:01] it says there's therefore now no
[1:05:05] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:05:08] Jesus amen condemnation is a killer
[1:05:11] amongst the Saints amen the sisters feel
[1:05:14] condemned sometimes when they look at
[1:05:15] themselves the other sisters amen
[1:05:17] sometimes the brothers feel condemned a
[1:05:19] preacher can turn around and condemn
[1:05:21] himself but nevertheless the gospel says
[1:05:24] there's therefore now no Nation to them
[1:05:26] that are in Christ Jesus if you catch a
[1:05:29] hold of that Revelation hold on to that
[1:05:32] piece of the ship amen amen and it'll be
[1:05:35] more than enough to take you where you
[1:05:38] need to go amen amen amen amen bless him
[1:05:43] sa when Paul and them was out there in
[1:05:44] that water in the midst of the darkness

[1:05:50] was holding them up the promise was that
[1:05:54] it was an anointing
[1:05:56] door handle amen it was an anointed way
[1:06:00] of Escape it it it wasn't just any
[1:06:03] regular piece of wood but God stepped in
[1:06:05] and did something amen oh yes there was
[1:06:08] something more that was holding him than
[1:06:11] what you could see with your natural eye
[1:06:13] amen what was holding him was that the
[1:06:16] word of God had already been spoken over
[1:06:19] him and it had been spoken over his life
[1:06:22] and We Know that heaven and earth can
[1:06:24] pass away
[1:06:26] but his word will never pass away so all
[1:06:29] he had to do was hold on to what the
[1:06:31] word said about him now if the word says
[1:06:34] about you that almighty God will have
[1:06:37] himself a BRI without spot or wrinkle
[1:06:41] that all you got to do is hold on to
[1:06:43] that word you might got wrinkles in your
[1:06:45] life that need to be ironed out just
[1:06:48] stay with the word you might have spots
[1:06:50] with in your life that need to be

[1:07:01] carries you to whever you need to go
[1:07:05] Hallelujah and what Paul had he didn't
[1:07:08] just have man's word but he had a word
[1:07:12] that said thus sayith the Lord you going

[1:08:18] permanent work amen amen am when Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ is holding you it'll cause you to
[1:08:24] forgive one another Hallelujah cuz
[1:08:27] sometimes forgiveness binds people up if
[1:08:29] Jesus Christ is holding you amen and
[1:08:32] your pastor preached the other night on
[1:08:34] Friday night when I was here that God is
[1:08:35] love amen hallelujah the perfect love
[1:08:38] amen if Jesus Christ is holding you amen
[1:08:42] then you going to manifest some perfect
[1:08:44] agape love amen amen amen if he's

[1:08:49] stri to be more clean and more holy and
[1:08:51] more purified and set aside the almighty
[1:08:53] God Jesus Christ holding you he can take
[1:08:57] care of all those things
[1:08:59] Amen to God lord lord when Paul was out
[1:09:04] in that water it was more than just a
[1:09:05] piece of wood holding them up am but he
[1:09:07] was being held up by the word of God
[1:09:09] Amen and Saints no matter what test that
[1:09:11] you dealing with it's not your own
[1:09:13] willpower holding you up amen it's not
[1:09:16] just because brother Simmons is a good
[1:09:17] man that's holding you up what's holding
[1:09:20] you up is the word of almighty God Amen
[1:09:24] and he'll have to bankrupt Heaven and
[1:09:26] Earth before he lets one word slip amen
[1:09:31] before he lets one word not come to pass
[1:09:34] he has to see it all the way through
[1:09:36] amen thank you Jesus Lord Jesus one
[1:09:40] thing we have to remember amen I ain't
[1:09:42] going to keep y'all all night amen what
[1:09:44] gives us confidence in every
[1:09:46] situation is the same God that brought
[1:09:49] you through it before will be the same
[1:09:52] God that will do it again Hallelujah
[1:09:55] amen amen he he allows us to get into
[1:09:58] things because the same God that did it
[1:10:01] before will be the same God that'll do
[1:10:04] it
[1:10:06] again you know one of the things that
[1:10:08] you have to understand about this
[1:10:10] shipwreck for Paul was that this was not
[1:10:14] Paul's first shipwreck amen he had done
[1:10:17] been there he had done done that he knew
[1:10:21] what his God can do
[1:10:23] amen you know the the scripture Paul
[1:10:26] starts to break down some of the things
[1:10:27] that he went through I'm going to read
[1:10:28] it to you briefly in second Corinthians
[1:10:32] praise God the 11th chapter and the 25th
[1:10:36] verse amen praise
[1:10:38] God and what happens amen I'm back up to
[1:10:40] the 24th verse Paul is starting to
[1:10:42] detail all of the things that he's gone
[1:10:45] through for the sake of the Gospel he's
[1:10:47] not boasting but but he's just letting
[1:10:49] people know that he been through some
[1:10:52] things he wasn't a rookie he done fought
[1:10:54] some battles
[1:10:55] that overcame a couple of things amen
[1:10:58] but God saw him through everyone he said
[1:11:02] sometimes preaching to those stiff neck
[1:11:04] Jews they would get mad at him and they
[1:11:06] will whip him amen and the Old Testament
[1:11:09] law was that you can whip them but you
[1:11:11] couldn't whip them 40 times of that cuz
[1:11:13] that was considered to be improper so
[1:11:15] they would whip you 39 times and Paul
[1:11:18] said I had that punishment done to me
[1:11:21] five times
[1:11:23] amen five times received die 40 Stripes
[1:11:26] save one five times that I reive the 39
[1:11:29] Stripes me y'all could do the math he
[1:11:30] took a lot of beatings amen it says
[1:11:34] Thrice was I beaten with rods this is a
[1:11:36] separate beating once I was stoned
[1:11:40] Hallelujah y'all know what stoning is
[1:11:42] Right praise God sometimes we get stoned
[1:11:44] for what we believe he said once I was
[1:11:48] stoned thce I suffered
[1:11:51] shipwreck Paul had already had three
[1:11:54] shipwrecks
[1:11:56] a night and a day I have been in the
[1:11:59] Deep now I used to always read second
[1:12:02] Corinthians thinking that Paul was
[1:12:04] describing part of his experiences from
[1:12:07] the book of Acts but I had to look it up
[1:12:09] a minut I'm not a Bible scholar but but
[1:12:11] I want to look I want to see what did
[1:12:14] Paul write out before he ran upon this
[1:12:17] shipwreck in the book of Acts and what
[1:12:20] did he write out after that shipwreck in
[1:12:22] the book of Acts and what I came to find
[1:12:25] out was that he had already written this
[1:12:28] before that story occurred in the book
[1:12:30] of Acts so what that lets me know Paul
[1:12:33] had done been through this show before
[1:12:36] and Paul had to understand of who Jesus
[1:12:38] Christ was and how Jesus Christ was
[1:12:41] going to take care of him exactly amen
[1:12:45] before Paul even got in this situation
[1:12:49] he had already written First Corinthians
[1:12:51] amen second Corinthians he had already
[1:12:53] written the book of Galatians he had
[1:12:55] already written The Book of Romans so
[1:12:57] imagine when Paul was out there in the
[1:13:00] water that night he started thinking
[1:13:02] about that letter that he wrote out to
[1:13:05] the Roman Church about this we know that
[1:13:08] all things work together for the good
[1:13:10] and what happened he got reminded of the
[1:13:13] word that almighty God had anointed him
[1:13:15] to write out to the people and imagine
[1:13:18] that gave him strength when he was out
[1:13:20] there floating on that board amen amen
[1:13:22] that even in the midst of this all all
[1:13:25] things will work together
[1:13:30] amen when Paul was out in that water he
[1:13:34] had already wrote out in the Book of
[1:13:36] Romans what could separate us from the
[1:13:38] love of
[1:13:40] God sometimes it feel like the enemy
[1:13:42] trying to separate you from the love of
[1:13:44] God Amen you might think that
[1:13:45] circumstances separated you from the
[1:13:47] love of God
[1:13:49] hallelujah but Paul let us know that
[1:13:52] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:13:55] God amen amen Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:13:58] Paul had already rolled out nay in all
[1:14:01] things we are more than conquer us amen
[1:14:05] amen he was in the water already
[1:14:07] manifesting what he already rote out for
[1:14:10] the believer that he was more than a
[1:14:12] conqueror that nothing could separate
[1:14:14] him from the love of God that all things
[1:14:16] even in him being in the midst of that
[1:14:18] storm all things still have to work
[1:14:22] together Hallelujah he had a test
[1:14:25] testimony Saints before the first
[1:14:27] shipwreck even happened amen he had a
[1:14:29] testimony in the midst of this shipwreck
[1:14:32] amen that all things will have to work
[1:14:35] together
[1:14:36] Hallelujah I'm drawing to a close but
[1:14:40] even after his
[1:14:41] trial he had to look at amen what he
[1:14:45] went through and sometimes our trials
[1:14:48] what our trials should do Saints we
[1:14:50] don't just go through trials so we can
[1:14:51] be beat up and shed some tears and pray
[1:14:53] a long time and then go on about our
[1:14:55] business but trials should grow us up as
[1:14:59] Christians trials should change how we
[1:15:02] look at things and we should come out of
[1:15:04] trials with a testimony amen amen amen
[1:15:09] hallelujah amen we shall come out of
[1:15:12] trials with a testimony otherwise the
[1:15:15] Lord will repeat the test again and you
[1:15:18] have to go through the same battle again
[1:15:20] amen amen Paul he started to write some
[1:15:23] things after he came out out of the
[1:15:25] Shipwreck amen and it was half the
[1:15:27] Shipwreck when he wrote the book of
[1:15:29] Ephesians and the Book of Philippians
[1:15:32] and the book of Colossians and the Book
[1:15:34] of Timothy amen 1 and second Timothy it
[1:15:37] was after the Shipwreck when he rode in
[1:15:40] Philippians the fourth chapter and the
[1:15:42] 13th verse that I can do all things amen
[1:15:46] amen through Christ who strengthens me
[1:15:49] amen amen Saints sometimes we don't feel
[1:15:52] like we could do all things but Jesus
[1:15:55] Christ operates on a different type of
[1:15:57] power than what we operate on our own
[1:16:00] and if Jesus Christ says that you can do
[1:16:03] all things then you could do all
[1:16:09] things it was after the Shipwreck amen
[1:16:12] that Paul could write out about a god
[1:16:14] who's blessed us with all spiritual
[1:16:17] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:16:20] Jesus amen and sometimes it feel like we
[1:16:23] living in Satan's Eden
[1:16:25] a literal hell on this Earth where the
[1:16:27] enemy seems like he's doing what he
[1:16:29] wants to do and Paul said that through
[1:16:32] your Revelation amen is a revelation
[1:16:35] that was lost Through the Ages but God
[1:16:37] restored it in the end time amen that
[1:16:39] you would be able to rest in Heavenly
[1:16:43] places in Christ Jesus
[1:16:47] amen it was after the Shipwreck amen
[1:16:50] that Paul could talk about that he has
[1:16:53] chosen us in him how longen probably God
[1:16:57] said was from the next Revival uh uh to
[1:16:59] the next service he CH us within him
[1:17:02] from before the foundation of the
[1:17:05] world and it reminds us that we were
[1:17:08] sealed that the Holy Ghost is a seal to
[1:17:11] the people of God yes it gives you
[1:17:13] strength yes it cleans up your life but
[1:17:16] it also a seal and the enemy cannot get
[1:17:20] into that seal because you're redeemed
[1:17:22] to the day of your Redemption amen amen
[1:17:26] amen s was after all these things amen
[1:17:30] Paul came out of this thing with a
[1:17:32] testimony he caught a hold of the right
[1:17:35] peace he trusted in almighty God and
[1:17:39] trust is something we've been working on
[1:17:40] back home trust is a beautiful thing
[1:17:43] trust means I don't always see the end
[1:17:45] of the story I don't see the answer but
[1:17:49] I still trust I believe that it's still
[1:17:52] going to take place anyhow amen amen
[1:17:54] amen Trust trust is actually an aspect
[1:17:56] of Faith amen we can trust God because
[1:17:59] we have faith in him
[1:18:02] amen amen amen amen one of my most
[1:18:04] favorite scriptures amen we trying to
[1:18:06] close amen Proverbs the thirr chapter
[1:18:09] and the 5ifth verse amen hallelujah she
[1:18:10] put it up before I can even get it all
[1:18:12] the way out I like that praise God
[1:18:14] that's an anointing
[1:18:16] amen you know I was dealing with this at
[1:18:18] the camp for Brother Anderson with the
[1:18:19] young people amen it's been a scripture
[1:18:22] it guided me through my teenager years
[1:18:24] it guided me in my 20s when I was in
[1:18:26] college amen it's guided me into my 30s
[1:18:28] amen even as a middle-aged man getting
[1:18:31] into my 40s now it still guided me and
[1:18:34] if Lord tering we get into our 50s it'll
[1:18:36] guide us then amen amen but when it says
[1:18:40] trust in the Lord amen yes think about
[1:18:43] all the things that people put their
[1:18:45] trust in a lot of people putting their
[1:18:48] trust into the next election they ain't
[1:18:50] going to get you but so far a lot of
[1:18:52] people putting their trust into the
[1:18:53] doctor but but you have to trust in the
[1:18:56] Lord amen and you being able to trust in
[1:19:00] the Lord if your footsteps are ordered
[1:19:02] by him the Lord is going to take care of
[1:19:04] you you can't trust everybody with
[1:19:07] certain things amen praise God
[1:19:10] Amen if I needed uh to get my kids
[1:19:13] something to eat right quick and I give
[1:19:15] brother Ernest $50 brother Ernest can
[1:19:16] you go down to the restaurant and get my
[1:19:18] bring my kids back something for my
[1:19:20] family give us a something to eat I
[1:19:22] spent enough time with brother Ernest
[1:19:23] that I trust him with that that $50 that
[1:19:26] he's going to bring back and mean he's
[1:19:28] going to bring back the things that I
[1:19:29] asked for or he's going to bring back
[1:19:30] the money to me amen I got trust in him
[1:19:34] but all of us know certain people that
[1:19:37] we would not hand them that $50 bill and
[1:19:40] ask them to do that for us amen because
[1:19:43] we don't have trust in them it could be
[1:19:46] things that they have shown us it could
[1:19:48] be that they have not come to a certain
[1:19:50] level of maturity yet but nevertheless
[1:19:52] what I'm trying to tell you is that you
[1:19:54] can't just put your trust in anything
[1:19:57] amen glory to God don't put your trust
[1:19:59] in man Hallelujah you can trust one
[1:20:02] another but you only trust even one
[1:20:04] another up to a certain extent by the
[1:20:07] power of Jesus
[1:20:10] Christ
[1:20:12] amen Saints when you trust in the Lord
[1:20:15] yes that can't be a halfway commitment
[1:20:18] amen I trust him up to a certain point
[1:20:21] but when it looks too difficult and I
[1:20:23] don't think that he can meet the
[1:20:25] challenge then I'll move my trust and
[1:20:27] I'll try to figure it out my own
[1:20:29] way the scripture says trust in the Lord
[1:20:33] with all of your heart amen amen trust
[1:20:37] me that I don't see it but I know that
[1:20:40] it's there yes Lord I don't see my truck
[1:20:43] outside but I know it's part right there
[1:20:46] if I was the duck behind here I can't
[1:20:48] see my wife right now but I trust that
[1:20:50] she's there amen because I've had enough
[1:20:53] experience to know it amen amen and
[1:20:56] trust in the Lord amen sometimes we
[1:20:58] can't see everything but nevertheless
[1:21:01] the scripture says trust in him with all
[1:21:04] of your heart Saints not with some of
[1:21:06] your heart with all of your heart amen
[1:21:10] and remember we in an age where God
[1:21:11] deals with the hearts amen true amen
[1:21:14] that's what Malachi 4 said I wouldn't
[1:21:16] turn your mind I wouldn't turn your ears
[1:21:18] but I will turn your heart in a time
[1:21:21] where you think that your heart going
[1:21:23] the right direction I will turn your
[1:21:25] heart back to something that'll get you
[1:21:28] on the right direction and Saints when
[1:21:30] your heart gets turned you don't have to
[1:21:33] worry about it amen amen
[1:21:36] amen sometimes people get upset cuz this
[1:21:38] person going this way and this person
[1:21:40] going that way what you'll find out
[1:21:42] maybe their mind got turned maybe their
[1:21:44] feelings got turned but their heart
[1:21:46] never got turned amen and when your
[1:21:49] heart gets fully turned to something GL
[1:21:52] to God Amen we got some teenagers in
[1:21:54] here when your heart as a young man gets
[1:21:56] fully turned towards a woman ain't no
[1:21:59] stop you amen we ain't rushing that
[1:22:01] before it's time amen but I'm just
[1:22:02] saying that heart is a powerful thing
[1:22:06] amen when you trust in him amen when you
[1:22:09] stop leaning to your own understanding
[1:22:12] when you stop trying to figure it out
[1:22:15] yes Lord God will bless you amen yes
[1:22:18] Lord Paul could rest on that broken
[1:22:20] piece because he know he didn't have to
[1:22:22] figure it out God had already said it
[1:22:25] about him amen and that settled it amen
[1:22:29] he didn't have to worry about it anymore
[1:22:31] amen musicians y'all can come on up amen
[1:22:34] hallelujah he didn't have to worry
[1:22:36] whether or not they were going to make
[1:22:38] it whether or not they were going to
[1:22:39] survive he knew what God had already
[1:22:42] said about him he knew that he had to
[1:22:44] appear before season amen amen God had
[1:22:47] gave him a path and it was up to God to
[1:22:50] take care of that path amen Saints God
[1:22:53] has given all of you a path
[1:22:55] amen and sometimes in our own feelings
[1:22:58] amen we don't feel like we adequate
[1:23:00] enough for the path amen sometimes we
[1:23:02] get that Gideon Spirit on us and the
[1:23:05] Lord says th Mighty Man of Valor I'm
[1:23:07] going have you take care of the enemy
[1:23:08] amen and take care of the battle for the
[1:23:10] people and Gideon looking around talking
[1:23:12] about boy who who Who's the Mighty Man
[1:23:14] of Valor here get in he talking about
[1:23:17] you me I'm out here hiding behind the
[1:23:21] house just to thres the wheat for my
[1:23:23] family
[1:23:25] but nevertheless the angel of the Lord
[1:23:26] saw something different in him amen even
[1:23:29] that Gideon could not see himself amen
[1:23:31] amen if God place you in a position
[1:23:34] Saints no matter what trial no matter
[1:23:36] what test amen your footsteps are
[1:23:39] ordered and all things have to work
[1:23:42] together amen sometimes it might not
[1:23:44] feel that you holding on to much but
[1:23:47] what God has us holding on to Saints is
[1:23:49] an anointed word a Vindicated word in
[1:23:52] this hour amen amen and that word has
[1:23:54] proven that it's more than enough for
[1:23:58] the people of God
[1:24:01] am the Lord shows so much that Paul's
[1:24:05] footsteps was ordered after they came
[1:24:07] out of the Shipwreck they landed on an
[1:24:09] island called M amen and the chating of
[1:24:12] the island amen his daddy was
[1:24:16] sick them being on that island they
[1:24:18] started to have a healing service on the
[1:24:21] island that they wasn't even supposed to
[1:24:23] be on in the first place but they were
[1:24:25] there because God had
[1:24:27] predetermined that somebody needs some
[1:24:29] help am amen what I want to let you know
[1:24:33] even in the midst of the Shipwreck that
[1:24:35] footsteps were on cuz they can have a
[1:24:37] healing service there were soldiers that
[1:24:39] got saved that was on the ship they
[1:24:41] would not have gotten saved except that
[1:24:43] shipwreck happen there was other people
[1:24:45] on the island that got healed they
[1:24:48] wouldn't have got that healing except
[1:24:50] that shipwreck happened amen
[1:24:54] and sometimes you overcoming these
[1:24:56] things you defeating these trials it's
[1:25:00] going to be a blessing to you and it's
[1:25:02] going to be a blessing to somebody's
[1:25:04] life amen am Saints I just want you to
[1:25:07] be encouraged to keep fighting amen amen
[1:25:11] I I I think about Paul when he wrote
[1:25:13] that letter to Timothy at the end of
[1:25:15] this
[1:25:16] journey and Paul was writing out I I
[1:25:18] fought a good fight amen Saints whatever
[1:25:21] we do fight a good foot
[1:25:26] amen the Lord had already told Paul all
[1:25:30] of them was going to make it not a soul
[1:25:32] would be lost all you got to do is stick
[1:25:35] with the
[1:25:40] ship man might have a negative opinion
[1:25:43] of your
[1:25:44] ship man might put up all kind of things
[1:25:47] on the internet about your ship but one
[1:25:50] thing you have to have a revelation of
[1:25:52] the ship that God has given you
[1:25:54] that is
[1:25:55] predestinated and predetermined because
[1:25:58] it's not based on man idea but it's
[1:26:00] based upon the word of God and the Bible
[1:26:03] lets us know that heaven and earth will
[1:26:05] pass away but his word will never pass
[1:26:08] away Saints we are an ordained
