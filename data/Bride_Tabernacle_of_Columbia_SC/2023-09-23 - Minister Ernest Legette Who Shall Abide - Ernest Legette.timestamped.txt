[20:33] Hill he that walketh upright uprightly
[20:36] and worketh righteousness and speaketh
[20:39] the truth in his heart you may be seated
[20:41] we'll read a little further down
[20:45] he that backbite of not with his tongue
[20:47] nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor
[20:51] taketh up a reproach against his
[20:53] neighbor and whose eyes a vowed person

[21:16] his word amen tonight by the grace of
[21:18] God we want to just speak to you for a
[21:21] moment on who shall abide amen
[21:23] on who shall abide I just want to forget
[21:26] the before I forget uh sisters whoever
[21:28] wanted me to thank the church for
[21:30] praying we had she asked to put a
[21:33] brother on the prayer list and the
[21:35] family was all afraid they thought he
[21:37] might have had cancer and but she said
[21:39] the other day when they went in to do
[21:41] the surgery or whatever it was it wasn't
[21:43] cancer at all so they was thanking the
[21:46] lord for that she says that they praise
[21:48] God all in the doctor's office
[21:51] so we thank God for that amen and God is
[21:53] still real isn't he so you know those
[21:56] prayers they mean a whole lot amen just
[21:59] to call that name or to call them in
[22:02] prayer God heard didn't he and I thank
[22:04] God tonight you think about saying oh
[22:06] you know God God he hears all in just
[22:10] the smallest things you know uh or
[22:13] sometimes we think but take it for
[22:15] granted if God won't move or God move
[22:17] his hand you know it'll be a lot worse
[22:19] than what it was is ain't it or it could
[22:22] be the other way so we always thank God
[22:24] thank God for watching over and keeping
[22:26] and and blessing us you know I was
[22:29] sharing with the the church the other
[22:31] week and how you know I says that what I
[22:33] do all the time especially if I'm not
[22:36] with the family and as soon as I hear
[22:38] them coming in the garage and I hear all
[22:40] of them come in the house within myself
[22:42] I start thanking God and praising God I
[22:45] says because I always say Lord thank you
[22:48] for allowing every one of us to make it
[22:50] back home tonight
[22:51] and and in the same way that we left out
[22:54] you know not coming back with or hurt
[22:58] harm or danger or got all our Limbs and
[23:00] all that every time we cross the
[23:02] threshold I always say Lord thank you
[23:04] because somebody left home and didn't
[23:06] return
[23:07] somebody a family member left and they
[23:10] didn't all come back but God is I said
[23:12] Lord you blessed us and I want to show
[23:14] you that I appreciate it and I tell the
[23:16] Lord thank you so that's important just
[23:18] like we always say is he allowed us to
[23:20] come together one more time you know we
[23:22] didn't do it on our own but God allowed
[23:24] us to be here tonight
[23:25] sometimes people say I just felt like
[23:27] coming you might have did but God
[23:29] allowed you to get here it was a wreck
[23:31] on the road on the way coming up here
[23:32] but yet God allowed us to be here so we
[23:35] ought to be thankful you know it humbles
[23:37] us in a way all the time we see the
[23:40] things that are happening in the world
[23:41] and and and just even in your hometown
[23:44] your heart goes out just because of the
[23:46] things that's happening and and you know
[23:49] tearing up you see your friends you see
[23:51] uh your um friend's children and all and
[23:55] all that lives being destroyed and
[23:57] things happening it burdens your heart
[23:59] even feel that way when you when you see
[24:02] uh them in that kind of condition I said
[24:05] Lord you know what what what is it going
[24:07] to take you know to change the world but
[24:11] you know it what it is God got to have
[24:14] mercy it it always says you know
[24:17] especially the older Saints they always
[24:19] say is this a Praying time but you find
[24:21] yourself saying that all the time now
[24:23] that it's a what it's a Praying time
[24:26] because sometimes you don't know what's
[24:28] going to happen next but I know one
[24:30] thing that God's got it all in control
[24:33] doesn't it tonight by the grace of God
[24:35] so we're gonna be it for you long I just
[24:37] want to minister on who shall who shall
[24:39] Abide a little something that the Lord
[24:40] put on our heart I I just kind of you
[24:43] know uh was looking at this as a little
[24:45] devotion the other day and you know what
[24:47] David had a question you know it says
[24:49] you know who shall abide you know he's
[24:52] talking about remain understand you know
[24:55] in God's Tabernacle you know where God
[24:57] is I said tonight you know I don't know
[25:00] about you but I want to be where God is
[25:02] all the time it's it's not it's not even
[25:04] safe to not be where God is right now
[25:06] you know and where God is he's more than
[25:09] just in church
[25:11] right here tonight but he's going to be
[25:13] with you tomorrow and he's with you the
[25:15] next day and the next day and so on I
[25:17] said God I always want to be with you
[25:19] you know and he says you know Lord who
[25:22] shall abide so then David began to talk
[25:24] about uh uh things of life you know a
[25:27] lot of times we can get into deep things
[25:29] in the in the in the word and all those
[25:32] things which God give us things to us
[25:34] for a reason but it's the things uh that
[25:38] God gives us to govern Our Lives by to
[25:41] help us you know from day to day I was
[25:43] thinking about that you know who shall
[25:45] abide you know Jesus said I think it was
[25:48] a Saint John 15 he was saying that if
[25:51] you abide in me
[25:53] and my word abide in you he said then
[25:55] you can ask what you will
[25:57] come on
[25:59] and I think about that you know that
[26:01] with certainty if you abide in him come
[26:04] on remain stand if you stand his word he
[26:08] said then you can ask what you will and
[26:11] one thing about God God isn't alive
[26:14] come on God can keep it just like what
[26:16] he said he said if you abide in me and
[26:18] my word abide in you then you can ask
[26:20] what you will
[26:22] and I said Lord it ain't that I'm asking
[26:25] because I got wants or I want to abide
[26:28] in you because I got wants but Lord I
[26:31] got needs that I need you
[26:33] I got needs that I need you to supply
[26:35] that I need you to to do in my life God
[26:38] that's why I want to abide because I got
[26:40] needs and he said he'll supply all your
[26:45] needs come on whether you're young or
[26:47] whether you're old he said I'll Supply
[26:49] what all of your needs according to his
[26:53] what riches in glory and you know we
[26:55] hold God to that that Lord you promised
[26:58] you said this is what you said
[27:00] come on you know I was thinking I was
[27:03] when I was looking at this like who's
[27:05] saying about who shall abide I says you
[27:07] know a lot of times you you know you
[27:10] look at and I'll skip down a little bit
[27:12] I said you know a lot of times we God
[27:15] put us on a path you know and what gets
[27:18] us off of that path a lot of time is
[27:20] because we don't take heed to what the
[27:22] inner voice is saying
[27:24] a lot of times you can call it
[27:26] conscience or whatever you want to call
[27:27] it but you know it's especially when the
[27:31] Holy Spirit comes it's an inner voice
[27:33] that comes with it
[27:34] is something that that that's with you
[27:37] all the time that that's guiding you or
[27:40] or telling you to take heed to this or
[27:43] take heed to that but many of times you
[27:46] know uh what happens is we don't heed
[27:49] that inner voice
[27:50] many times uh the people would have
[27:53] listened to that inner voice they
[27:54] wouldn't have ended up in the way they
[27:56] were
[27:57] they wouldn't ended up in the shape they
[27:58] were a lot of times people always says
[28:00] you know before a person leave here they
[28:03] already know something already worn them
[28:04] you know Warren always come before
[28:06] judgment
[28:07] come on that inner voice but a lot of
[28:09] times we ride right past that inner
[28:11] voice don't we I had experiences twice
[28:14] this week you know I was I was I was
[28:16] doing something and you know at work and
[28:18] and I was just reaching out for
[28:21] something and but something on the
[28:22] inside said leave that alone
[28:25] get away from that leave that leave that
[28:28] and I heard I heard the word greed
[28:31] something said greed
[28:34] leave that alone
[28:35] but I began to say what it is you can
[28:38] you can override that inner voice
[28:41] or you can take heed
[28:43] because God began to speak to me and
[28:45] says you know as he did David he give
[28:49] him anything he want if that wasn't
[28:50] enough he'd gave him more right but he
[28:54] says that we got a lot of times you know
[28:57] just us thinking about that a lot of
[28:59] times we ain't satisfied with what God
[29:01] gives us
[29:02] we ain't satisfied with what God laid
[29:05] before us we want more
[29:07] but don't you know God knows what's best
[29:09] for you don't you know what God God
[29:12] gives you is the best
[29:14] come on but we don't sometimes we want
[29:17] more we reach out for more and that's
[29:18] where the trouble comes in
[29:20] you know that's where the eve eve
[29:22] thought that you know what God gave she
[29:25] had the tree of life but she wanted more
[29:27] didn't she and what happened you know
[29:29] and listen to the enemy yeah I know what
[29:32] God gave you but you know it's it's a
[29:35] little more that he holding from you I
[29:37] said Lord I thank God for every I thank
[29:39] you for everything you give me I thank
[29:41] you for the little I have the much
[29:42] whatever you give me God I'm satisfied
[29:44] with it I'm content with whatever you
[29:47] give me God because I don't deserve to
[29:49] have none of it anyway
[29:51] I ain't even worthy to have no no you're
[29:53] talking about these materialistic things
[29:55] that one day will be burned in the fire
[29:57] one day be going away that ain't the
[29:59] things we rejoicing in but what we're
[30:01] rejoicing in is that God I thank you one
[30:04] day you came down and you did something
[30:06] in my life you pick me up from where I
[30:09] was and you saved my soul that's what
[30:11] I'm thankful for
[30:13] I was telling Charlotte the other night
[30:14] uh the last night I think it was I said
[30:17] you know us coming up and I was just
[30:20] telling her this last night I said some
[30:22] of the places that I hung out at I knew
[30:25] even then back then that anything could
[30:27] happen at any time
[30:29] you had to worry about your friends you
[30:31] had to worry about your enemies you had
[30:33] to worry about everybody at any time
[30:34] anything gonna happen at any time but
[30:37] yet you still was crazy enough to go in
[30:39] those places
[30:40] why because your flesh desire your flesh
[30:44] overrode what you knew was was natural
[30:47] and made sense and made you go into
[30:49] those places but even in your
[30:52] transgression even in that God still had
[30:55] mercy on you in that when you were a
[30:57] lost or wretch without God he still had
[31:00] mercy on you so you look back at those
[31:03] times and you say God I thank you for
[31:05] keeping me back then
[31:08] and you know what I says that what it is
[31:10] a lot of times we look at some God might
[31:13] be quick to judge or go ahead and
[31:15] judgment why because sometimes he know
[31:17] they won't repent
[31:19] he know that they ain't gonna do right
[31:21] come on
[31:22] God be the judge but I says but yet he
[31:25] looks at us sometimes and he says that
[31:27] even though he's wrong I know that in
[31:30] his heart
[31:31] come on
[31:32] one day you know in his heart
[31:37] he want to do right so God what's in
[31:40] your heart or speak sometime you believe
[31:42] that tonight but I say is that what it
[31:44] is we find that I says that that inner
[31:46] voice
[31:47] we bypass it a lot of time don't we
[31:50] we bypass that inner voice
[31:52] come on I says but to listen to it you
[31:56] know I was sharing with somebody at work
[31:58] the other day they was talking about
[31:59] something and I asked them I said hey
[32:01] why don't you just pray about it
[32:03] won't you just ask God about it they
[32:05] told me Earnest I don't want to ask God
[32:07] about this
[32:09] and he said it kind of jokingly I said
[32:11] but you know what happens a lot of
[32:14] people that's the way they think that's
[32:16] the way they are they don't ask God
[32:18] about certain things they don't want to
[32:19] ask God because of one of two things
[32:22] they're afraid that his answer gonna be
[32:24] against what they desire
[32:26] oh they already know what's wrong
[32:29] so they ain't gonna they ain't gonna
[32:31] pray they ain't gonna ask God about it
[32:33] come on but it it's it's something
[32:36] within us we got to find a way to get
[32:39] past what our flesh wants
[32:42] but what we as a a fleshly inside wants
[32:45] a desire and say lord it's not my will
[32:48] but Lord let your will be done you know
[32:50] I woke up the other night and uh like I
[32:53] was saying I woke up the other night and
[32:54] I couldn't go back to sleep this was uh
[32:56] probably Wednesday night I think it was
[32:58] and and uh so I when I couldn't go back
[33:01] to sleep I just started praying I was
[33:03] telling told Charlotte about five in the
[33:06] morning I've been praying all night long
[33:07] because I couldn't go back to sleep but
[33:09] you know I found myself just praying for
[33:13] everybody I was praying for everybody
[33:14] Lord help them everybody the Lord put on
[33:17] your heart just praying and pouring out
[33:19] for everybody but then all of a sudden
[33:22] you know
[33:23] it's as though I was sitting down in the
[33:26] stairs
[33:27] it's as though the Lord was showing me
[33:30] myself in some ways and says now you
[33:33] stood in the Gap and intercede for
[33:35] everybody but let me work on you some
[33:38] begin showing me it's just the little
[33:41] things you know in your life that he
[33:44] says you know I want you to reckon with
[33:45] this I want you to reckon with that so I
[33:47] began to say Lord after doing all that
[33:50] praying I said Lord I need your help
[33:53] God I don't pray for everybody to tell
[33:55] us Charlotte I said with it I had to
[33:57] pray for myself for a while because the
[33:59] Lord showed me hey I want you to work on
[34:02] this area I want you to to clean this up
[34:04] I want you to do that he began to deal
[34:06] with you in your personal life and I say
[34:08] it's what it is a lot of times we can
[34:10] see everybody else but what about you
[34:13] everybody else I said Lord help me you
[34:16] know it's certain ways you you know
[34:19] about yourself that you don't see but
[34:22] the Holy Spirit got to come down and
[34:24] expose it come on you you're the selfish
[34:27] one you're the you're the one with the
[34:29] attitude you're the one the Holy Spirit
[34:31] want to come down and show you yourself
[34:33] sometime but what it is like I said that
[34:35] inner voice you got to listen to it you
[34:38] got to because he gonna come and tell
[34:39] you you know he's your best friend
[34:41] he gonna tell you when you're wrong he
[34:44] gonna tell he gonna tell you the truth
[34:45] about yourself everybody else ain't
[34:47] gonna tell you the truth but he gonna
[34:49] tell you the truth he gonna tell you
[34:51] because he knows who you are that's one
[34:54] person you can't hide from
[34:56] we can hide from everybody else and try
[34:59] to be somebody that we're not and all
[35:00] those things but one person you can't
[35:02] hide from and that's God
[35:04] Hallelujah but he becomes he comes down
[35:07] and he shows us some praying you know
[35:09] praying for a while I begin to say Lord
[35:11] you know uh work on work on me
[35:14] help me
[35:16] God I want to go higher in you come on I
[35:19] want to do the things I said a lot of
[35:21] times you know people they they use uh
[35:25] because we know that in the in the
[35:27] scriptures a lot of the the uh the
[35:29] Patriarchs and those their mistakes were
[35:31] shown to you in the scriptures you know
[35:34] so a lot of times you know the devil
[35:36] uses those let you look at those
[35:38] mistakes and use them for for uh for a
[35:42] patent your own self on the back or or
[35:44] making your own self feel good about the
[35:46] weaknesses that you have or making your
[35:49] own self feel good about the ways that
[35:51] you are but you know I begin to think
[35:54] about one of the biggest things is is
[35:56] David and Bathsheba a lot of people
[35:58] break that up don't they I says but one
[36:00] thing about David he was quick to repent
[36:04] and and he says I thought on my ways he
[36:07] was quick the not only yeah but when it
[36:10] came out he thought on his ways didn't
[36:12] he he began to thank Lord I'm thinking
[36:15] on my ways I might be the king I might
[36:17] be this one but God I ain't above
[36:19] reproach I ain't above walking Lord
[36:21] created me a clean heart and renew the
[36:23] right Spirit on me he thought on his
[36:24] ways and that's where I was at the other
[36:26] night after I said doing all that
[36:28] praying I said Lord this is where I'm at
[36:31] I'm thinking on my ways I'm thinking of
[36:33] you say oh you know come on you say what
[36:36] you you ain't perfect nobody's perfect
[36:38] remember that if you was perfect you
[36:40] wouldn't have no need to be here no more
[36:41] would you but God is still what working
[36:44] on us ain't he
[36:45] God is working on us come on bringing us
[36:48] to that place I thank God tonight you
[36:50] thank God tonight you know he says who
[36:53] shall he says who shall abide come on
[36:55] who want to live in that place where God
[36:57] is there's no safer place that there is
[37:01] to be than in where God is come on I
[37:04] want to abide there do you want to buy
[37:06] there tonight come on one moment out of
[37:09] his presence might cost you everything
[37:11] one moment outer's presence might be the
[37:14] end of the story but if you abide in
[37:17] there come on abide and in that presence
[37:19] he said you can ask what you will abide
[37:22] in there come on no danger hurt no harm
[37:24] he says oh Israel I would love to gather
[37:27] you under my wings as a hen does a chick
[37:29] God want to take care of you he loved
[37:31] you so much that he laid down his life
[37:33] for you he gave everything for you went
[37:35] to the Cross he died nobody wanted to
[37:38] Behold Him but that's uh pilate said
[37:40] behold a man he didn't look like much
[37:42] but he was all at the work he was the
[37:45] maker of the world he was everything
[37:47] that you needed everything was wrapped
[37:49] up in him didn't look like much
[37:51] but he was a jewel hidden a hidden Jewel
[37:55] oh when I was a lord saved me real young
[37:59] I always say that all the time 19 years
[38:01] old and what he what he's bringing you
[38:04] to sometimes you didn't know didn't look
[38:06] like much but you found out inside of
[38:08] those lonely roads those lonely days
[38:11] sometimes but it was all right why
[38:14] because God was there with you he kept
[38:17] you guide you he held your hand like I
[38:20] said it's been a long journey but Jesus
[38:21] was right there by your side the whole
[38:23] time and you thank God because you look
[38:25] back all the mountains and the things
[38:27] that God's brought you through all your
[38:29] Breaking Point all the times when you
[38:31] should have just gave up and walked away
[38:33] but yet God was holding your hand the
[38:35] whole time Hallelujah do you believe
[38:38] that tonight you had to have been there
[38:40] to experience that come on but God knows
[38:43] I said who shall abide tonight amen
[38:45] [Applause]
[39:05] hey man you appreciate the word tonight
[39:08] [Applause]
[39:11] you don't put me on spot again
[39:15] amen but as he was saying tonight if you
[39:18] abide in him you can ask what you will
[39:20] and he'll do it amen
[39:22] I mean he said a lot of things and I
[39:25] appreciate the word tonight because
[39:26] sometimes you need a word from the Lord
[39:28] to speak to you you need something to
[39:30] come across that God has just so you can
[39:32] examine yourself you can look at
[39:34] yourself and said you know what Lord I
[39:36] need to grow Closer to You Lord I want
[39:38] to abide in you each and every day am I
[39:41] checking what I'm doing each and every
[39:42] day am I looking at myself and
[39:44] intrinsically thinking about Lord
[39:46] what do you want me to do
[39:49] where do you want me to go am I doing
[39:51] what you what you lead me and got me to
[39:53] do am I asking you Lord what do you want
[39:55] me to do and taking those moments each
[39:58] and every day when I wake up in the
[39:59] morning Lord lead and guide me today
[40:01] Lord lead me to where you want me to go
[40:04] Lord God my prayer life Lord God my each
[40:07] and every conversation that I have that
[40:09] I may be a light for you that I may
[40:12] Shine for and said you didn't want to be
[40:14] like that candle in a dark room even if
[40:17] it's dark around you you still spreading
[40:19] light and everyone around you notices
[40:21] that your light is shining but the only
[40:23] way you can do that is if you abide in
[40:25] them if you take each and every day and
[40:27] you abide in him and say Lord I want you
[40:29] to abide in me so that in your word to
[40:32] abide in me and I noticed when he said
[40:34] in the scripture he said it he said if
[40:36] your word's abide in me so it was more
[40:38] than one word it was the whole thing it
[40:40] was everything that God has said and you
[40:42] want it all to be inside of you so that
[40:44] you can always have his words in you you
[40:47] can always lean back and say Lord I got
[40:49] something to defeat the Devil I got
[40:51] something to defeat the when the trials
[40:54] and tribulations come I can look back
[40:56] and I got something to hold on to I got
[40:58] something that that not only has changed
[41:00] my life it's continuing to change my
[41:03] life it's continued to move and progress
[41:05] and make me better each and every day
[41:07] and that's what it is when you abide in
[41:09] him he'll continue to lead and guide you
[41:12] and make you grow into in what he wants
[41:14] you to be
[41:21] foreign
[41:25] really short amen
[41:28] so by the grace of God we thank God for
[41:31] instead of you abide in me and my word
[41:33] abide in you you can act what you will
[41:34] and not do so we thank God for brother
[41:38] ernage for Caleb thank God for all
[41:41] our visitors tonight we thank God for
[41:43] you we
[41:46] want to say I was just reading the
[41:49] message on Divine love
[41:51] and that when
[41:53] Divine love is there and then
[41:56] The Sovereign Grace would take over
[42:00] and that's what we want God's Sovereign
[42:03] Grace to take over our lives Divine love
[42:07] and looking at Divine love
[42:10] I says
[42:11] I was teaching in
[42:13] something
[42:15] on a Wednesday night
[42:18] concerning being perfect and on Mullins
[42:21] I decided not to preach and teach
[42:24] on being perfect
[42:28] and we hear even hear her brother
[42:31] Ernie said Nobody's Perfect
[42:34] and I says
[42:36] and he got in
[42:38] the Matthew
[42:41] 5 48 says be ye perfect as your father
[42:44] which is in heaven is perfect
[42:47] I said would God ask you to do something
[42:50] that's impossible to do
[42:53] so when we look at that word perfect
[42:55] we're looking at
[42:56] God says be holy for I'm holy
[43:00] can we be holy and I think one of the a
[43:06] few of the people in Sumter says only we
[43:11] we can be perfect
[43:12] only when we die
[43:16] and getting ready to go to heaven
[43:19] and uh
[43:21] so we had them the answer and Mullins
[43:24] and answer and something and I'm saying
[43:28] I find out nobody's perfect no artists
[43:31] we can't use that for an excuse
[43:36] but Paul says I pressed towards the
[43:38] marker the prize of the High Calling of
[43:40] God that's in Christ
[43:45] so it was all it has to be that
[43:48] that you're pressing towards that you
[43:50] striving for
[43:54] then the church we are in the age of
[43:57] perfection this the church that's going
[44:00] to be raptured is going to be a perfect
[44:03] without spot rank up blemish or any such
[44:06] thing so if we're in the age of
[44:08] perfection then God is not allowing us
[44:12] to be in the Martin Luther Day in the
[44:14] Reformation period of John Wesley day in
[44:17] uh you know the Methodist Holiness he's
[44:20] not allowing us to be in Azusa Street
[44:23] when Seymour and the Holy Ghost was
[44:25] pulled out on the through the street in
[44:27] the gift of the store but this is the
[44:29] age of perfection
[44:31] God is when we walk out of here in the
[44:34] Rapture you're not going to walk out
[44:36] here uh you know less than perfect
[44:40] so God is sending an anointing
[44:44] a presence
[44:46] that your condition can't be uh uh I
[44:50] can't stop doing this and can't stop no
[44:52] God is going to give you the spirit and
[44:54] the power
[44:56] to do what he said he wants in this hour
[45:00] so he gives you the anointing
[45:02] he get and God is calling for perfection
[45:05] so you hi it's impossible yes all things
[45:10] are possible to what
[45:13] to them that bleed
[45:15] if we believe what God says then it's
[45:18] possible
[45:20] are you with me
[45:23] I'm not going to start maybe I'll
[45:27] dwell on that a little bit Sunday
[45:29] morning but by the grace of God I just
[45:31] thank God for everyone and um
[45:35] just abide in God Amen
[45:38] if you're not in him
[45:40] it's time to do
[45:42] get in gone
[45:44] not in the church
[45:47] but in God
[45:50] Jesus said no man can come to the father
[45:52] except he come by me
[45:55] are you with me
[45:57] except a man be born again he cannot see
[45:59] or enter the kingdom of God
[46:02] so if we're going to want to go in the
[46:04] kingdom of God
[46:05] I'm telling you Stark out there
[46:09] somebody called me and told me since
[46:12] you know I was on my way

[48:08] and if you don't do who's going to do it
[48:10] they need somebody to know that this

[49:09] testimony
[49:12] are you gonna tell it right now
[49:15] okay
[49:17] I was I was hoping he'd do it tonight
[49:19] but that's why I called on it because it
[49:22] was short
[49:30] um
[49:32] I'll make it short a few years back I
[49:34] used to
[49:35] I was
[49:37] graduated and I was I used to tell
[49:39] people they asked me what did I want to
[49:41] go back to school I used to say I said
[49:45] that God went out before I went to
[49:47] college I I got down on my knees I said
[49:49] a prayer I said Lord I had to take my
[49:51] standard test one more time I said Lord
[49:53] I want to make a score
[49:55] high enough because my parents don't
[49:57] have the money I don't have the money to
[49:59] pay for it
[50:00] so I said Lord I want you to provide a
[50:02] way
[50:03] the next day I went took my test got
[50:05] back a few months later got my score and
[50:07] I made the exact score I needed to to
[50:09] get the scholarships I needed to pay for
[50:12] school
[50:13] so I went to undergrad and God blessed
[50:15] me so I didn't pay a dime and they paid
[50:17] me
[50:18] so I when I got done and I graduated I
[50:20] said Lord if you want me to go back to
[50:23] school I believe you're the same guy
[50:25] that did it once you can do it again
[50:28] so a few years down the road this year
[50:31] this past year I got actually I got laid
[50:34] off on my job and back in May
[50:37] and I was like trying to figure out
[50:39] what's the next role ended up going to a
[50:42] local school having a conversation
[50:44] thinking about I was going to just take
[50:46] some classes but I kept getting a run
[50:48] around a run around someone was there
[50:50] and it was like you should change your
[50:52] approach and I said you know when I
[50:55] always said if the Lord opens a door for
[50:57] you all you got to do is walk through
[51:00] so I I was like you know what that door
[51:02] might not be open and I went down the
[51:05] university and I wouldn't talk to
[51:06] someone that asked him about information
[51:08] about their program
[51:10] and the person said
[51:12] um you you seem like a good candidate
[51:14] let me send you the application to apply
[51:17] now mind you I didn't do anything
[51:19] special and I said well the only way
[51:21] that I'm going is if it's free
[51:23] and then they said well let me see let
[51:25] me check out the process they go back
[51:28] they called me the next day and then I
[51:30] was looking for a one-year program but
[51:31] they said have you looked at the
[51:33] two-year program I said no I haven't and
[51:36] then she person called me back and said
[51:38] well
[51:38] if you if you decide on that one
[51:41] everything will be paid for
[51:44] and so the Lord has blessed me to go
[51:46] back to school I'm in school now full
[51:47] time and everything is paid for
[51:50] so we thank the Lord for that
[51:54] just proving that he said that if you
[51:57] abide in me you can ask what you will
[51:59] and I'll do it so the same God of
[52:01] yesterday he's just saying God today and
[52:04] that you can believe in what you pray
[52:05] for even though you may not see it
[52:07] coming to pass today it took five years
[52:10] for that prayer to come true
[52:12] it took five years and you said well the
[52:15] Lord ain't answering my prayer if you
[52:16] just wait your answer is on the way amen
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:25] I said he just abbreviated everything
[52:28] you had time because
[52:31] Ernest was real short
[52:33] so I said he had time to not to
[52:35] abbreviate so by the grace of God
[52:39] everybody's all right
[52:50] of Abigail that the University of South
[52:54] Carolina yeah who's Abigail
[52:57] had my daughter back then
[53:00] at the University of South Carolina but
[53:03] um when she was coming out of high
[53:04] school
[53:06] she didn't have enough money to go they
[53:08] didn't they said she only could get what
[53:11] um the life scholarship would pay for
[53:13] and they called them and I was like I'm
[53:16] sorry we don't have no other help for
[53:17] her we can't give her no other money or
[53:19] anything and so I said you know she
[53:21] works at Publix and they have tuition
[53:23] reimbursement so that gave us another
[53:25] four thousand dollars and she go to
[53:28] school I said well just get the loan
[53:30] that they give you at the school and
[53:32] then when Publix pay you back you will
[53:34] have to you know we'll pay the money
[53:37] right back to the school but it was
[53:39] still I believe was it sixteen hundred
[53:42] dollars a semester still left over and
[53:45] so I said well I'mma just have to pay
[53:48] our plan don't get on the payment plan
[53:50] and everything at the school and so
[53:52] during that same time I was applying a
[53:54] job came open a job that I wasn't too
[53:57] crazy about being a manager but I said
[53:59] well this job will pay more money and
[54:01] just to give me the money I need to pay
[54:03] for her tuition for school so I got the
[54:06] job and so after I got the job Abigail
[54:09] went to check I said Abigail get the
[54:11] thing ready let me go ahead and set up
[54:13] your payment plan so I can start making
[54:15] your payments for your classes or
[54:17] whatever and when she went on the board
[54:19] she they oh they gave her back eight
[54:21] dollars so you didn't have to pay
[54:23] anything out of pocket so I just want to
[54:25] thank the Lord for providing I pray that
[54:26] he provide for the rest of these six
[54:28] years
