[40:43] really wasn't sure which way uh
[40:46] I should go this morning
[40:48] and uh
[40:50] of course
[40:51] anytime ministers got an opportunity to
[40:53] stand before God's people he's always
[40:55] real concerned about what he shares
[40:57] I want to make sure he's doing the will
[40:59] of God
[41:00] so uh my thought changed several times
[41:05] this week and changed again this morning
[41:09] so I sincerely ask your prayers because
[41:11] uh
[41:12] I just want to make sure I'm preaching
[41:14] the right message at the right time
[41:16] you know
[41:18] I know brother Simmons know what I'm
[41:20] talking about and sure this other
[41:21] ministers here can relate
[41:22] God and give you a thought and you're
[41:24] preach it at one service and
[41:26] it has a whole congregation on their
[41:28] feet and you preach that same servant in
[41:29] another church and everybody sits and
[41:32] stares and because
[41:33] there's a certain message for a certain
[41:35] time for certain people
[41:37] are you following me and that's what the
[41:38] Menace is really burdened by this Lord
[41:39] am I am I bringing the right message for
[41:41] this group that I'm standing before this
[41:43] morning so I don't want to preach a
[41:44] message for another church at this
[41:45] church
[41:47] I want to preach what God has for you
[41:48] this morning and I want to make sure
[41:50] that's the way I'm going so I say that
[41:52] to say that I'm real nervous this
[41:53] morning because I I had a had a change
[41:56] of Direction Change of thought this
[41:57] morning and just want to make sure I'm
[41:58] going in the right direction so I
[42:00] actually just sincerely be praying for
[42:01] me I know you are but just be praying
[42:02] for the preacher this morning that God
[42:04] will have them relax and that I'll be
[42:06] able to get out of the way and God can
[42:07] share that which he wants to share with
[42:09] you but having said all that I'm invite
[42:11] you to stand one more time we're going
[42:12] to look at the scriptures
[42:14] we're going to look at Genesis chapter
[42:15] 13.
[42:17] verse 3. Genesis Chapter 13 Verse 3.
[42:22] and uh and I just wanted to bring you

[44:25] south even to Bethel
[44:27] unto the place where his tent had been
[44:30] at the beginning
[44:31] between Bethel and Haya
[44:34] and the place of the altar which he had
[44:36] made there at the first
[44:40] and there Abraham called
[44:42] on the name of the Lord
[44:45] Inspire his once again
[44:48] dear heavenly father Lord I want to give
[44:49] you thanks for your grace
[44:51] Lord we've read your word that's about
[44:52] as far as we can go as a man
[44:54] so Lord we just committed to you
[44:57] thank you for what you'll do in Jesus
[44:59] Christ's name we ask it amen you may be
[45:02] seated
[45:03] title of my message this morning
[45:06] is the altar
[45:08] and I like to read that scripture again
[45:10] it's just two verses
[45:12] and he that's Abraham went on his
[45:15] journey from the south even to Bethel
[45:18] unto the place where his tin had been at
[45:20] the beginning
[45:22] between Bethel and hayai
[45:25] and unto the place listen
[45:27] and unto the place of the altar
[45:30] because you see this place that Abraham
[45:32] was returning back to
[45:33] was a place where Abraham had come out
[45:35] of UR the Chaldeans and Abraham when he
[45:38] arrived at a certain place he was
[45:40] inspired there by the Holy Spirit to
[45:43] build an altar
[45:44] and he built an altar and worship to God
[45:46] the god that had met him and called him
[45:48] out of the out of the earth of Chaldeans
[45:50] the god that told him that he's going to
[45:52] come out and show him a land the god
[45:54] that had made his promise to Abraham
[45:55] Abraham felt inspired to worship His God
[45:58] so in order to worship Him Abraham built
[46:01] an altar and I want to title my thought
[46:03] for the day the altar
[46:06] the alternate scripture that is
[46:08] identified as a special place before God
[46:11] especially for worshipers
[46:13] because all in the Old Testament is
[46:15] usually associated with worship
[46:18] not just associated with worship of
[46:20] Believers but we find Believers and
[46:23] unbelievers recognize that when you
[46:24] approach God they wanted to approach him
[46:26] by an altar
[46:28] and we will find out in the Old
[46:29] Testament and it wasn't just something
[46:30] that the Hebrews or the Jews did it
[46:32] wasn't just something that Christians or
[46:34] Believers did when we talk about this
[46:36] altar it was something that idolatrous
[46:37] did just as much as Believers did or you
[46:40] follow me because they recognized there
[46:41] was a right way to approach God and if
[46:43] you're going to approach God they
[46:44] recognized the way to do it was by an
[46:46] altar or you follow me so the altar was
[46:49] Associated as a place of worship but the
[46:51] thing I want to point out today is it
[46:52] wasn't just a place of worship the altar
[46:55] was also a place
[46:56] of sacrifice
[46:58] because see when you had this altered in
[47:00] this office altered and stand in pray
[47:02] upon empty Auto the reason they built
[47:04] the altar was because there was
[47:05] something that was going to be performed
[47:06] on top of that Altar and what they often
[47:08] did was they provided some type of
[47:10] sacrifice before the god that they were
[47:13] worshiping as a homage to the God and as
[47:15] an honor to the one that was approaching
[47:17] now I want to talk about his Altar for
[47:19] just a little bit
[47:20] this altar itself is is actually
[47:23] not very much when you look at the
[47:25] appearance of it
[47:26] because I got a feeling that the altar
[47:28] that Abraham is talking about here the
[47:29] Bible's talking about him it's talking
[47:31] about Abraham I got a feeling it's also
[47:32] it's not a very pretty thing it probably
[47:34] wasn't very shaped very uh you know
[47:36] uniquely or anything it was probably a
[47:38] rock that Abraham found somewhere in the
[47:40] wilderness and Abraham said this rock is
[47:42] as good as any he just needed a place in
[47:44] which he can take that animal that he
[47:45] wanted to offer to God and have a clean
[47:47] place and we can make his offering are
[47:49] you follow me so it wasn't nothing
[47:50] pretty or nothing special about the
[47:52] altar usually with you know you probably
[47:54] look at it most of the time it's
[47:55] probably some plain rock or playing
[47:57] Stone something they found in the
[47:58] wilderness so it's not the shape or the
[48:00] size of the altar that was important but
[48:03] what made it important was what was
[48:04] offered listen on top of the altar
[48:08] so it wasn't the altar
[48:11] it's what's on the altar are you follow
[48:13] me that's what made the thing important
[48:15] to God it wasn't the altar but it was
[48:17] the sacrifice that was placed upon it
[48:19] and the sacrifice before God listened
[48:22] was the thing that was separating or
[48:24] used to separate the worshipers for the
[48:27] Bible talks about the first two
[48:28] worshipers that we see outside of Garden
[48:30] of Eden it was Cain and Abel in the
[48:32] Bible when it talks about Cain and Abel
[48:34] it doesn't really even mention the
[48:36] altars when Paul begins to describe what
[48:38] happened in the book of Hebrews chapter
[48:40] 11. if you notice Paul never even talks
[48:42] about the altar
[48:44] what Paul talks about was the sacrifice
[48:47] he said Cain's sacrifice was not
[48:49] accepted but Abel's sacrifice was
[48:52] accepted so so when we talk about the
[48:54] altar even though the altar is important
[48:56] what's most important is not the altar
[48:58] what's important is what's happening on
[49:00] the altar are you following him that's
[49:01] what God's looking at I want to go a
[49:03] little further so Paul doesn't talk
[49:05] about what was the altar itself Paul
[49:07] only does it one thing Abel's sacrifice
[49:09] and Cain's sacrifice and I want you to
[49:11] watch this the sacrifice is important
[49:13] because the sacrifice says a lot listen
[49:15] now about the condition of the heart of
[49:18] the one that's doing the worshiping so
[49:20] God is not so much concerned about the
[49:22] Altar and it's really not so much
[49:23] concerned about the sacrifice what God
[49:25] is really concerned about is the heart
[49:27] of the one that's doing the worship him
[49:29] but you can look at the offering listen
[49:31] now and you can learn a lot about the
[49:33] one that's doing the worshiping by what
[49:35] they're offering listen unto their gods
[49:37] let me go a little further so the heart
[49:39] is the real focus of the worship and the
[49:42] Altar and the sacrifice only becomes an
[49:43] hour expression of what's Happening
[49:46] inside of that man's heart now I want to
[49:48] give you a couple of scriptures to show
[49:49] you what I'm looking at by this Jesus
[49:50] gave an example in the scriptures he
[49:52] said there were two men that came to an
[49:54] altar to pray
[49:55] both men made an alter it made an
[49:58] offering
[49:59] not an offering of animal blood listen
[50:01] now
[50:02] but they made an offering of their lips
[50:05] before God in the temple
[50:07] it came in the book of Saint Luke verse
[50:09] 18. chapter 18 verse 10. let me read it
[50:12] to you Saint Luke 18 10. it said two men
[50:16] went up into the temple to pray
[50:18] and the one of Pharisees and the other
[50:21] Republican and the Pharisees stood and
[50:24] prayed thus within himself God I thank
[50:27] you that I'm not asked his other man as
[50:29] of the men are extortionists unjust
[50:31] adulterous or even as there's Publican I
[50:35] fast twice a week I give tithes to all
[50:37] that I possess now I want you to watch
[50:39] this this man is actually in the temple
[50:41] of God he's no doubt standing before the
[50:44] altar God and His ashes in his Temple
[50:46] he's making his offering to God based
[50:49] upon his lips but his lips is on
[50:51] expressing now listen now what's inside
[50:54] of his heart
[50:56] and what he's doing is he's justifying
[50:58] himself before God telling God how I've
[51:00] done this and how I've done that and how
[51:02] I thank God not for what God's done
[51:04] listen
[51:06] but what he's done
[51:08] and I want you to watch this verse 12 a
[51:10] fast twice a week I give tithes of all
[51:12] that I possess
[51:13] and the public is standing afar off
[51:15] we're not so much as lift up his eyes
[51:18] unto heaven but smote his breath saying
[51:20] God be merciful to me a sinner
[51:24] see he knew his real condition he was in
[51:27] the same shape that Republican was that
[51:29] Republican was no better than this
[51:30] public I mean the uh the Pharisee was no
[51:33] better than the Republican was but the
[51:35] difference was this Republican knew it
[51:38] this Pharisee didn't
[51:40] and so it was the offering that God was
[51:43] looking at and the offering was showing
[51:46] what was in these man's heart but now
[51:47] watch this
[51:48] he said I tell you that this man the
[51:50] Publican went to his house Justified
[51:53] rather than the other for everyone that
[51:55] exalted himself shall be a base but he
[51:58] that will humble himself shall be
[51:59] exalted so God actually was watching
[52:02] both men make their offering but he had
[52:04] respect for one offering but the other
[52:06] thing he didn't have a whole lot of
[52:07] respect for because but a man had the
[52:08] wrong Revelation and how he was given
[52:10] his offering unto God now let me keep on
[52:12] going
[52:14] God was more concerned about the
[52:16] condition of the man's heart
[52:17] then the actual Act of committing a
[52:20] prayer you see a lot of times we can
[52:22] come before an altar and we can make a
[52:24] sacrifice we can do certain things
[52:25] before God but God is not so much
[52:27] looking at what we do all the time as
[52:29] much as God is looking at what's the
[52:31] condition the heart of the person that's
[52:32] going through the motion now watch this
[52:34] it's the inside that God is looking at
[52:36] and the inside man that God is looking
[52:39] at is God is looking at your heart
[52:43] now I'm not saying that that's no matter
[52:45] what we look like on the outside
[52:47] but what's most important Above All
[52:49] Things is what you look like on the
[52:51] inside
[52:52] because sometimes what things like an
[52:54] outside don't always reveal what's
[52:56] happening on the inside
[52:58] I had a Bible study yesterday with a
[52:59] family
[53:00] and the lady might not necessarily look
[53:02] like everybody would anticipate maybe
[53:04] the lady should look or you follow me
[53:06] but as we said in the discussing the
[53:08] word with her and she began to cry
[53:09] Through the Bible study because she
[53:11] began to confess she said I've been
[53:12] struggling
[53:14] I've been having problems I want to be I
[53:16] want to be able to believe this word
[53:17] like you believe it
[53:19] but what was it the world was actually
[53:21] having an effect on the heart I wouldn't
[53:22] look at how she looked I'm looking at
[53:25] what's going on inside and the way I
[53:27] knew I was going inside because when I
[53:28] saw something coming out of the outside
[53:29] but sometimes brother Simmons you could
[53:31] have a sister and she could be dressed
[53:33] so tight it ain't nothing happening on
[53:34] the inside are you following me that's
[53:37] when Jesus met that woman at the well he
[53:38] wasn't looking at the inside on the
[53:40] outside because the disciples he sent
[53:42] him away he said because when I meet
[53:43] this woman I saw in the vision they
[53:45] gonna wonder why he talking to her
[53:46] because she don't look like somebody
[53:47] that we should be socializing with but
[53:50] Jesus wasn't looking at it outside Jesus
[53:52] was looking at her inside
[53:54] oh you following me so when God is
[53:57] looking for worshipers he's not
[53:58] concerned about the offering and he's
[54:00] not even I mean the Altar and he's not
[54:02] even so much sometimes the sacrifice
[54:03] what's most important is the heart of
[54:05] the one given the sacrifice but the
[54:07] sacrifices only testifying or what's
[54:09] happening inside that man's heart let me
[54:11] kill a little further let me give you
[54:12] another example Luke chapter 21 verse 1.
[54:16] and Jesus Christ again
[54:18] talking about two people
[54:20] and he looked up and saw rich men
[54:23] casting their gifts into the treasury
[54:26] and he saw and again we're talking about
[54:28] offering making a sacrifice they're
[54:30] casting their gifts into the treasury
[54:32] and he saw also a certain poor Widow
[54:34] cast in their their two mites so you got
[54:37] these rich men that were casted into the
[54:39] treasury and you got this widow woman
[54:41] who only casting two mice and he said of
[54:45] a truth I say unto you that this poor
[54:48] woman listen poor Widow has casted in
[54:50] more than they are even though they were
[54:52] given their big offers and on the
[54:54] outside it looked like these men really
[54:55] love God they blessed the church but it
[54:58] wasn't so much what they were given it
[55:00] was what was in their heart here comes a
[55:02] woman and she puts in two mites and
[55:05] Jesus Christ said she's given more
[55:07] than they are watch what he says for all
[55:10] these have given of their abundance cast
[55:12] into the offerings of God but she of her
[55:16] private has cast in all the living that
[55:20] she had in other words she gave her very
[55:24] last sense after this little two mice
[55:28] she had nothing else to give and I want
[55:29] you to watch this who made the greatest
[55:31] sacrifice the people that put in a lot
[55:34] or the one that only put into mice the
[55:37] one up two mice didn't put some of what
[55:39] she had listen she gave God this in our
[55:42] church she gave God all that she had
[55:46] I don't want to give God some of what I
[55:49] got I want to give God all of what I've
[55:51] got because the Bible didn't say give
[55:53] God some he said let the Lord thy God
[55:55] with all of that heart with all of that
[55:57] soul and with all of thy might are you
[55:59] follow me let me go a little further
[56:00] each person was listened was at the same
[56:04] Temple and gave their offering unto God
[56:06] but God was not impressed with the size
[56:09] of the offering but the condition of the
[56:11] heart of the person given the offer and
[56:12] I want you to watch this now this this
[56:15] uh my understanding from looking up this
[56:17] online because I'm just kind of curious
[56:19] what who might mean
[56:20] you know we say two minds and we say she
[56:22] gave all but what does two mice mean so
[56:24] I looked online to see what two mice
[56:26] being two mice is about the cost of an
[56:29] average dinner
[56:31] this woman had just enough money to buy
[56:34] one more meal
[56:36] and then she was broke
[56:38] you know mostly have already got enough
[56:39] money to buy one meal is I'm gonna hang
[56:41] out with this because when I get hungry
[56:43] I'm gonna need it but this woman that
[56:45] the last bit of money she had to buy one
[56:48] more meal
[56:49] she put it in the offering
[56:51] and she was a widow woman so she had no
[56:54] husband to go out and make no more money
[56:57] and it made me think about that woman
[56:58] that was in the Old Testament
[56:59] that Elijah came to
[57:02] amen and the Bible said that she came to
[57:04] Elijah came to her and said woman give
[57:06] me a drink of water and the Bible said
[57:08] she'd turn to get him a drink of water
[57:09] because she can give us water he said
[57:11] and bring with it and make me a cake
[57:14] and she turned back around she said I'd
[57:16] give you some water
[57:17] but for the cake I got just enough bread
[57:20] and just enough oil to bake one cake and
[57:23] after that that's my last meal that me
[57:25] and my son gonna die she was just like
[57:27] this with a woman she had just enough
[57:28] for one more meal
[57:30] but when Elijah asked for water she said
[57:32] I'd give you water but this meal part I
[57:34] don't know about and Elijah said bake me
[57:37] a cake first and feed me and then
[57:40] afterward feeds you in your house for
[57:42] thus said the Lord the crew should not
[57:44] run dry until God sends rain in the
[57:46] Earth
[57:47] so this woman had to recognize something
[57:49] she had to recognize that if I honor God
[57:51] first this man is speaking in the name
[57:54] of the Lord if I honor God first I bless
[57:57] my own knees what a great sacrifice
[58:01] you see the value of the offering it
[58:03] wasn't how much he had but she was
[58:06] willing to give her last meal in order
[58:08] to honor God's word that's how I want to
[58:11] serve my God I don't want to just offer
[58:13] out of my abundance when I got plenty of
[58:15] time I give them 15 minutes of prayer
[58:16] when I ain't got no time let me make
[58:18] time
[58:20] God's your best
[58:22] but let me keep going
[58:24] so these two widow woman's gave God all
[58:26] that they had
[58:27] and it wasn't much but it wasn't their
[58:29] mouth that was important it was what
[58:30] they were willing to give they're
[58:32] willing to put themselves into a
[58:34] position of self-sacrifice and I want
[58:36] you to get this self-sacrifice
[58:39] they're all cells in order to see
[58:42] somebody else blessed in the kingdom of
[58:45] God
[58:46] both of these women in order to do this
[58:48] listen
[58:49] could not do it Brothers it was about a
[58:50] revelation
[58:52] you see it wasn't just the act of
[58:54] somebody saying you better give them a
[58:56] tie or you better give a certain
[58:58] offering or you better dress a certain
[59:00] way or you better pray a certain way it
[59:02] wasn't a commandment so much as what is
[59:05] he recognized there was a promise
[59:08] associated with what they were doing
[59:10] and they had to have a revelation that
[59:13] the promise was unto them otherwise they
[59:16] would have never done it
[59:17] this woman here in Elijah said baby case
[59:19] first but thus said the Lord your Crews
[59:22] should not run dry until God says rain
[59:24] she had to believe that was God's word
[59:26] and a promise to her
[59:28] she had to have faith if I do what this
[59:30] man says there's a blessing coming
[59:32] behind if I do what he says
[59:34] and then the woman that had the two mice
[59:36] she had a promise too God said in the
[59:38] Old Testament The Book of Malachi he
[59:40] said come bring your tithered off into
[59:42] my Storehouse and not part of blessing
[59:44] that shall not have rumors to see she
[59:45] had to have a revelation if I give God
[59:48] my last God's going to give me greater
[59:53] and the reason people give these weak
[59:55] sacrifices and give weak decadation it
[59:57] only shows there's something wrong with
[59:59] the revelation
[1:00:01] because this is not the real altar this
[1:00:03] is the real altar
[1:00:06] [Applause]
[1:00:08] and if you ain't got nothing on this
[1:00:10] this don't matter
[1:00:12] you understand now watch is the altar
[1:00:15] both of these women can make the
[1:00:17] sacrifice they made because they had a
[1:00:19] revelation from the word what God was
[1:00:22] going to do if they approached it right
[1:00:25] and that's what some people brother
[1:00:26] Simmons are cheap on the pocketbooks
[1:00:28] come time for the first of the morning
[1:00:30] whenever they pay him they're not sure
[1:00:33] what's gonna happen if I give if I give
[1:00:36] this what's coming back but anyway you
[1:00:38] know what I'm saying
[1:00:40] so the widow woman listen that Jesus
[1:00:42] spoke of
[1:00:43] had a promise just like the other woman
[1:00:46] had a promise and I want you to just
[1:00:48] follow me here for a minute
[1:00:51] this sacrifice I'm talking about
[1:00:54] has to go far beyond
[1:00:56] just our mental thinking about God
[1:00:59] if all we got is a carnal mind
[1:01:02] we're going to be like Cain
[1:01:04] knew there was a god
[1:01:07] but he had no revelation
[1:01:09] he could build this altar
[1:01:12] but this altar was weak
[1:01:14] are you following me I'd rather have a
[1:01:17] strong altar here
[1:01:18] and nothing not so pretty here
[1:01:20] then it had the biggest best church you
[1:01:22] can ever have and be missing something
[1:01:24] here
[1:01:25] you understand let me go a little
[1:01:27] further
[1:01:28] so beyond the law our Revelation has to
[1:01:31] be a faith in the heart
[1:01:33] that demonstrates what we believe about
[1:01:36] God
[1:01:37] Israel offered God's sacrifices but the
[1:01:40] Bible says in the book of Isaiah that
[1:01:42] God said that their sacrifices though it
[1:01:45] was according to the law of Moses have
[1:01:47] become a stench in God's nostrils what
[1:01:50] was it it wasn't the altar
[1:01:52] and it wasn't the animal so much but the
[1:01:55] problem was that their heart listened
[1:01:57] and the one that was giving it their
[1:01:59] heart wasn't acceptable to God so even
[1:02:01] though they were doing it according to
[1:02:03] the word god couldn't be pleased with it
[1:02:05] because the heart wasn't correct so the
[1:02:07] point I'm trying to make is we're
[1:02:08] talking about the altar the real altar
[1:02:10] God wants to look at
[1:02:12] is inside of you
[1:02:14] or you follow me let me keep going
[1:02:17] so God rebuked him for their sacrifices
[1:02:19] because there also wasn't right they
[1:02:21] gave it but the Bible talks about them
[1:02:23] giving it without the true sincerity
[1:02:25] that's associated with revelation
[1:02:27] they knew what the word said do but
[1:02:30] there was no faith in what they were
[1:02:31] doing so God couldn't receive it
[1:02:34] now let's look at Cain neighbor here for
[1:02:36] a minute
[1:02:37] if we look at Cain and Abel these two
[1:02:38] boys
[1:02:40] were the probably the two first authors
[1:02:42] we see built in the Bible
[1:02:44] after the Garden of Eden when man had
[1:02:46] fallen were put out of the garden Cain
[1:02:48] and Abel was the first two boys that we
[1:02:50] see building altar before God
[1:02:53] and look at what God says about this
[1:02:54] offering as I said earlier Paul doesn't
[1:02:57] talk so much about the altar but Paul
[1:02:59] focused more about what they offered and
[1:03:02] listen and why they offered it
[1:03:05] the Bible said that it was faith that
[1:03:07] made the difference you see God looked
[1:03:10] down at both offerings and God didn't so
[1:03:12] much look at the altar God didn't even
[1:03:14] so much look at the sacrifice but the
[1:03:17] Bible said what God was pleased with
[1:03:19] Abel's faith
[1:03:21] because Abel had a revelation like those
[1:03:23] two Widow Mormons he had a revelation on
[1:03:25] why he was doing what he was doing and
[1:03:27] it was the Revelation that Abraham had
[1:03:29] that made God that made God happy
[1:03:31] because the Revelation wasn't coming
[1:03:33] just an emotional doing the sacrifice
[1:03:35] the Revelation was coming from his heart
[1:03:36] now I want you to watch this
[1:03:38] Abel's revelation of offered a lamb had
[1:03:42] to go beyond just listen him offering a
[1:03:45] lamb up on the altar or some animal but
[1:03:47] Abel's sacrifice was him willing to be
[1:03:49] identified with his revelation of God so
[1:03:53] much so that when he was confronted by
[1:03:55] what he believed Cain killed him not
[1:03:58] just because of the Lamb
[1:04:00] Cain killed him because of his testimony
[1:04:02] of his revelation
[1:04:04] he was willing they loved God so much he
[1:04:07] was willing to die listen church with
[1:04:10] his sacrifice
[1:04:12] he wasn't going to back down he wasn't
[1:04:14] going to say well Cain you know yours is
[1:04:16] pretty good he said all they could do is
[1:04:17] can't say why'd you do what you did he
[1:04:19] said God show me that the reason that
[1:04:21] we're here was not because Mom and Dad
[1:04:23] say some apples God show me the
[1:04:25] Revelation was Mom committed adultery
[1:04:27] and she had two kids and I won by Adam
[1:04:32] any other one
[1:04:34] was not by Adam
[1:04:37] and when Cain heard that
[1:04:39] he was rough
[1:04:40] you tried to call me
[1:04:42] the son of a beast was it the same thing
[1:04:45] Jesus told the Pharisees you and your
[1:04:47] father the devil he identified them by
[1:04:49] their work so they were and that came
[1:04:51] only identified him by what he was doing
[1:04:54] and he roams I'm angry and slew him
[1:04:57] brother Brown said on the same altar
[1:04:59] that he offers lamb can't slew him on
[1:05:02] the same altar everyone's willing to be
[1:05:04] identified and death listen with his
[1:05:07] sacrifice
[1:05:09] and that was only a type
[1:05:11] every believer real believer is willing
[1:05:14] to be identified with this word even
[1:05:17] unto death and I'm not so much talking
[1:05:19] about death of your mortal body it turns
[1:05:21] what you breathe but I talk about death
[1:05:22] to your own self
[1:05:24] you're willing to adapt to everything
[1:05:26] that's contrary to God's word to be
[1:05:28] identified with this book
[1:05:31] let me keep going
[1:05:34] how do we die
[1:05:37] we die for a reason
[1:05:41] without a god might live
[1:05:43] he said brother Mike God's already
[1:05:45] living you see
[1:05:46] you but God wants to live in you
[1:05:50] you see Christ ain't come to Calvary
[1:05:52] just so that we can walk in heaven
[1:05:55] Christ came from Calvary
[1:05:57] because brother Brandon said it was
[1:05:58] God's desire
[1:06:00] listen to living man
[1:06:03] in the Garden of Eden God lived in Adam
[1:06:06] but after the fall that life of God in
[1:06:09] man is what separated God in Adam in the
[1:06:12] garden
[1:06:13] we hear this talk about God made uh Adam
[1:06:16] a god of the earth yes he was but do you
[1:06:19] realize what made Adam a god of the
[1:06:20] Earth God was in him brother God lived
[1:06:23] in Adam the same way that the prophet
[1:06:25] said that the Bible Jesus said the Bible
[1:06:27] said that the prophets were Gods what
[1:06:29] meant those prophets Gods wasn't it Mom
[1:06:32] and Daddy was it something Bible study
[1:06:34] that it had what made them Gods when God
[1:06:36] came down it's wealth in Moses that name
[1:06:38] Moses of God with pharaoh it wasn't his
[1:06:41] flesh it was God in him and what made
[1:06:44] Adam a god upon the Earth but brother
[1:06:45] Brown said in the beginning God and Adam
[1:06:48] were one God lived in Adam
[1:06:52] in the life of God in Adam made Adam a
[1:06:55] god of the Earth
[1:06:57] but in the fall this was separated
[1:07:00] and so God's desire was to down Calvary
[1:07:03] that the life that Adam lost that life
[1:07:05] might once again live inside a man
[1:07:09] so man wouldn't just be a church goal
[1:07:11] man wanted to come into offer and offer
[1:07:13] lamb man could actually have a living in
[1:07:15] him the literal life of God
[1:07:18] so therefore the works that God does
[1:07:20] brother Simmons we can do also why
[1:07:23] because God's in you great as he is in
[1:07:26] you that heed Us in the world
[1:07:29] follow me
[1:07:31] so God wants that Altar and brother will
[1:07:33] say hi to God dwell in man he dwelt
[1:07:35] inside of our hearts
[1:07:38] let me keep going
[1:07:40] but in order for God to live in man
[1:07:43] died in the garden by sin
[1:07:46] and separated him
[1:07:49] but the only way for God to come back
[1:07:51] is that man's got to die again
[1:07:55] death separated you and the only thing
[1:07:58] that could reunite you is death
[1:08:00] because the Bible said you got to be
[1:08:01] born again
[1:08:03] brother said it this way how can you be
[1:08:06] born again
[1:08:07] except you die first
[1:08:09] this man here this old man
[1:08:12] he's got to die
[1:08:14] listen he becomes now the sacrifice
[1:08:20] when the word is being preached and you
[1:08:23] recognize when you're wrong it's
[1:08:25] something convicts your conscience
[1:08:26] something in your heart
[1:08:28] says I'm wrong
[1:08:30] and then you want to put yourself on the
[1:08:33] altar like that Republican did and said
[1:08:35] God I'm the Run wrong forgive me and
[1:08:37] brother Brown said when you died from
[1:08:39] repent and you're forgiving your sins he
[1:08:41] said that God sends an abstract the Holy
[1:08:43] Ghost the life of God unto you but you
[1:08:45] first got to recognize you're wrong
[1:08:48] and then have a desire to die to that
[1:08:51] thing
[1:08:52] you see the problem is a lot of people
[1:08:53] recognize it wrong he started recognized
[1:08:55] he was wrong but he didn't want to die
[1:08:57] to that thing
[1:09:00] recognize you wrong is one thing
[1:09:02] but dying to it is all together
[1:09:04] different
[1:09:05] there's many drug addicts right now that
[1:09:07] are recognize I wish I never took my
[1:09:09] first hit but they won't let that thing
[1:09:11] go
[1:09:12] amen and maybe they can because it's got
[1:09:14] a hold of them but if they ever get
[1:09:16] desperate enough they said God it was my
[1:09:18] fault I took that first hit but God if
[1:09:20] you'll forgive it please take this thing
[1:09:22] from me and the power of God
[1:09:25] but they gotta admit where they're wrong
[1:09:28] and Believers got it through the same
[1:09:30] thing what's wrong with the church we're
[1:09:32] not willing to admit when we're wrong
[1:09:36] we want to take sin and thought of the
[1:09:37] rug and put it in the bed in the closet
[1:09:39] do whatever you do except for a minute
[1:09:41] where it's wrong
[1:09:43] and that stifles the power of God
[1:09:47] now watch this
[1:09:49] how do we die
[1:09:51] we prostrate ourselves to our own will
[1:09:54] and our own ideas about God and his word
[1:09:58] prostrate means to completely lay
[1:09:59] yourself out
[1:10:01] you know we'll pray like this sometimes
[1:10:02] standing
[1:10:03] get on our knees
[1:10:06] prosperate me completely laid out
[1:10:08] Lord whatever you want to do like a
[1:10:11] little like a dead man on the floor have
[1:10:12] your way
[1:10:14] that's how we got to come before God
[1:10:15] completely prostrate
[1:10:17] letting God have his way and I want you
[1:10:19] to watch this
[1:10:21] we've got to die
[1:10:24] so he can live
[1:10:27] and Christ realized this himself
[1:10:30] he had to die
[1:10:32] so that you can live
[1:10:34] and he was willing to prostrate himself
[1:10:37] but for Calvary that he might die
[1:10:41] that we might live
[1:10:42] let me go a little bit further
[1:10:45] we got to be willing to prostrate
[1:10:46] ourselves and become so dead to our own
[1:10:48] desires
[1:10:49] that we can become born again
[1:10:51] that God's life can look can live in us
[1:10:54] on our altar
[1:10:56] not a blood of a bull and a goat but
[1:10:59] God's sitting back an abstract of the
[1:11:01] Holy Spirit upon your altar your heart
[1:11:04] that God can receive you because you now
[1:11:06] got the right offering on your heart the
[1:11:08] only offer that he'll receive
[1:11:10] amen now you watch this
[1:11:12] to do that we have to become a Living
[1:11:15] Sacrifice
[1:11:17] we die that he might live in us now I
[1:11:20] want you to watch
[1:11:21] how you put this in the type
[1:11:24] he said Abel is not only willing to
[1:11:26] offer a sacrifice
[1:11:28] but he was willing to die with his
[1:11:30] sacrifice and the message he must be
[1:11:32] born again he put it like this he says
[1:11:34] now the approach of this birth there is
[1:11:36] an approach to it and to be and to be
[1:11:39] the approach of this birth you have to
[1:11:41] go through a process just like anything
[1:11:43] that lives anything that lives again has
[1:11:46] to die first you cannot keep your Same
[1:11:49] Spirit you cannot keep your same habits
[1:11:52] you cannot keep your same thoughts now
[1:11:53] what I'm talking about here is a
[1:11:55] sacrifice and the sacrifice is not
[1:11:58] accepted when it's living a sacrifice
[1:12:00] has to be committed completely and the
[1:12:02] way you committed completely was you
[1:12:04] kill it we're going to do the offer God
[1:12:06] of land and say God here's my lamb and
[1:12:07] then wait 15 minutes say okay thank you
[1:12:09] Lord I'm taking it back home now
[1:12:11] that ain't no sacrifice but when you put
[1:12:14] that thing up on that you say Lord I'm
[1:12:16] not taking it back Lord I give this to
[1:12:18] you and I'm not taking it back
[1:12:21] kill it and the same thing with you and
[1:12:23] I if we're going to give ourselves as a
[1:12:25] sacrifice to God you can't give God
[1:12:27] yourself one day and take it back the
[1:12:28] next day you land I think an altar until
[1:12:30] something come down and kills it
[1:12:33] and brother bam said you get up without
[1:12:35] your same thoughts and we're not the
[1:12:36] same desires something in you change is
[1:12:38] why it's been consumed by the hand
[1:12:40] almighty God let me keep going
[1:12:42] you cannot keep the same habits you you
[1:12:44] cannot keep the same thoughts you got to
[1:12:47] die you got to die like he died you got
[1:12:49] to die on his altar like Abel did with
[1:12:52] his lamb you got to die with chair lamb
[1:12:55] Jesus Christ died on Calvary and he said
[1:12:57] except the man is willing to take up his
[1:12:59] cross daily and follow me he's not
[1:13:01] worried and what he's saying is you got
[1:13:02] to be willing to die to yourself the way
[1:13:04] he died to himself
[1:13:06] let me keep going
[1:13:08] you got to die
[1:13:10] Die Young thinking to be born to his
[1:13:12] thinking let the Mind happens in Christ
[1:13:14] be in you you got to think his thoughts
[1:13:17] and his thoughts listen Church
[1:13:19] it's his word
[1:13:21] brother bam said what is a thought or
[1:13:23] what is a word
[1:13:25] it's a thought expressed
[1:13:27] so if you're going to express his
[1:13:28] thoughts
[1:13:29] then we could think his thoughts
[1:13:31] is to think his word
[1:13:33] because his words are his thoughts in
[1:13:35] book formed I want you to watch this
[1:13:37] the words of thought expressed
[1:13:40] and if we're going to think his thoughts
[1:13:41] it's got to be his word
[1:13:43] and it can't be his thoughts of some
[1:13:46] other day
[1:13:47] but it's got to be listen his thoughts
[1:13:50] for this day
[1:13:52] because this Bible
[1:13:54] as the prophet said it's not a book of
[1:13:56] History
[1:13:57] it's a book of Prophecy
[1:13:59] and every age has this portion of this
[1:14:01] book that God plans to manifest in that
[1:14:04] age
[1:14:05] and if we're going to think his thoughts
[1:14:07] God don't want you thinking his thoughts
[1:14:08] that Noah thought
[1:14:10] because we'll be out here brother
[1:14:11] Simmons trying to be boat builders
[1:14:14] he don't want us to think when Moses
[1:14:16] thought could we be thinking we got to
[1:14:17] go back over to Africa to get in Egypt
[1:14:18] to come out Egypt
[1:14:20] no God wants you to think what was God
[1:14:22] thinking about your age
[1:14:24] because see before the foundation of the
[1:14:26] world the Bible said he knew the end
[1:14:28] from the beginning
[1:14:29] and so in every age he landed on his
[1:14:32] word and said in this age I'm gonna do
[1:14:34] this in this age I'm gonna do that in
[1:14:35] this case I'm gonna do that and this
[1:14:36] stage I'm gonna do that but in order for
[1:14:38] me to do this I gotta have that to work
[1:14:40] by
[1:14:41] because brother said he does nothing but
[1:14:43] through the agency of man
[1:14:45] so if he's going to fulfill his word in
[1:14:47] every age there's got to be somebody
[1:14:48] that can receive that word or receive
[1:14:51] his thinking
[1:14:52] in order to bring his thoughts to pass
[1:14:54] in the form of the word
[1:14:56] but in order to do that brother Brown
[1:14:58] said you got to be willing to die
[1:15:02] to your thinking
[1:15:04] I don't mean to be hard on nobody's
[1:15:05] Church
[1:15:06] but why won't the Pentecostals Manifest
[1:15:08] this bride age
[1:15:10] because she rejected the thought of what
[1:15:12] God thought about a bride
[1:15:14] she had her church thoughts what a bride
[1:15:16] looked like but God had his thoughts of
[1:15:18] what a bride looked like why won't the
[1:15:20] Baptist manifest the bride age because
[1:15:22] the Baptists got their thoughts what God
[1:15:24] looks words look like but the God has
[1:15:26] his thoughts of what God's word looked
[1:15:27] like and the same thing is happening
[1:15:29] around this message they're going to be
[1:15:31] many brother Simmons write his message
[1:15:32] they're not going to manifest the bright
[1:15:34] age why because they're holding on to
[1:15:35] their thoughts or what a bright age
[1:15:37] should look like but God got his
[1:15:38] thoughts on what a bride it should look
[1:15:40] like but if everybody's willing to die
[1:15:42] to your think and say God I'm not smart
[1:15:44] enough to know what you're thinking Lord
[1:15:46] reveal to me the same way you reveal the
[1:15:48] Abel reveal the being the same way you
[1:15:50] revealed that with a woman reveal to me
[1:15:52] the same way you came to John the
[1:15:54] Baptist God revealed to me that I might
[1:15:56] know your word for this age
[1:16:00] but we're getting too smart
[1:16:02] studying too much
[1:16:04] trying to figure out what we think God's
[1:16:06] saying instead of finding an altar in
[1:16:08] our home and getting on our knees and
[1:16:10] praying while there was reading them and
[1:16:12] say Lord show me that word
[1:16:18] why is this message so tore up today you
[1:16:21] got camps everywhere because they taking
[1:16:24] this message and they're taking his book
[1:16:25] and they're so dissected it
[1:16:28] based on what they think
[1:16:30] I think it come between six and nine
[1:16:34] I I think he coming uh
[1:16:39] let me leave it alone
[1:16:41] I think he's coming after the Prophet
[1:16:43] come back
[1:16:45] are you following me there's all kind of
[1:16:48] doctrines about his coming
[1:16:51] Burbank said I don't care how he's
[1:16:53] coming
[1:16:54] I just want to know that I'm ready for
[1:16:55] him
[1:16:58] when he comes
[1:17:00] so whatever he says got to happen
[1:17:02] because he's going to interpret his own
[1:17:04] word if I know that my ALT is right I
[1:17:07] know I got on me the right sacrifice
[1:17:09] listen to the church that God's looking
[1:17:11] for that I know when he comes I'm going
[1:17:13] to go with him he comes because I'm
[1:17:15] ready I got the right sacrifice
[1:17:17] let me keep going
[1:17:19] so Jesus recognized as he was teaching
[1:17:22] to disciples it wasn't just to say out
[1:17:24] enough to say I believe the word
[1:17:26] but you've got to be able to recognize
[1:17:28] the word in its season
[1:17:30] look at how Jesus Christ put it to
[1:17:31] disciples Matthew chapter 5 verse 21.
[1:17:34] you have heard that it was said
[1:17:36] by them of old time
[1:17:38] thou should not kill now Jesus Christ is
[1:17:41] quoting in a word
[1:17:43] but notice how he put it old time
[1:17:47] see he understood something
[1:17:49] he knew that times had changed
[1:17:54] see the law was until John the Baptist
[1:17:57] but since that time
[1:18:00] the kingdom of God was preached
[1:18:03] there was a shift
[1:18:06] the Pharisees didn't catch it
[1:18:08] because they didn't let go of their
[1:18:09] thinking
[1:18:10] of what God's idea of the word was they
[1:18:13] held to what their thoughts or what
[1:18:15] God's idea of the word was but when
[1:18:17] Jesus came he said I do nothing except
[1:18:19] the father showed me first he recognized
[1:18:21] even though he was God in flesh he was a
[1:18:23] man willing to be led by the spirit
[1:18:28] or you follow me let me keep going
[1:18:31] Thou shalt not kill
[1:18:33] and whomsoever shall kill shall be in
[1:18:35] danger of judgment that's what you say
[1:18:37] in old times but now watch how he
[1:18:39] changes the message
[1:18:41] but I say unto you that whosoever is
[1:18:43] angry with his brother without a cause
[1:18:45] shall be in danger of judgment
[1:18:47] so now what he was showing is not that
[1:18:49] what Moses taught was wrong but that
[1:18:52] dispensation has changed Brother Brad
[1:18:55] said he didn't get rid of it all but in
[1:18:57] his dispensation what he magnified it
[1:19:00] or you finally let me keep going
[1:19:03] and whosoever to say to his brother raka
[1:19:05] shall be in danger of the council that's
[1:19:07] man but whosoever shall say thou fool
[1:19:10] shall be in danger of Hell Fire it gone
[1:19:13] from a counsel of man now you understand
[1:19:14] Before the Throne of almighty God and
[1:19:16] given that Lord you follow me it was a
[1:19:18] changing of dispensations so what are
[1:19:20] you saying brother Holloway in order to
[1:19:22] be able to think God's thoughts you got
[1:19:24] to be able to catch the change of his
[1:19:26] dispensation and you'll never do it in
[1:19:28] your thinking and Lord knows I'll never
[1:19:30] do it in my thinking the only way we'll
[1:19:32] ever do it there's got to be somebody
[1:19:33] that's willing to get quiet enough and
[1:19:35] long enough where God can talk to you
[1:19:37] and reveal exactly what's taking place
[1:19:39] let me keep going
[1:19:41] so Jesus wasn't saying Moses long was
[1:19:43] Moses law was wrong he was simply
[1:19:45] acknowledging that the dispensation had
[1:19:47] changed the message had changed from
[1:19:50] what was to what is now let me go a
[1:19:52] little bit further
[1:19:53] the Pharisees could not see it
[1:19:55] and that's what I want to get to my
[1:19:57] point
[1:19:57] I want to bring my thought to a to a
[1:20:00] conclusion listen in the message birth
[1:20:02] pains
[1:20:03] and remember my thought
[1:20:05] the altar
[1:20:08] I started with the altar
[1:20:11] on the altar is where the sacrifice is
[1:20:14] offered
[1:20:16] but the right sacrifice is offered
[1:20:19] can only be offered right revelation
[1:20:23] because of the sacrifice is not so much
[1:20:25] the physical
[1:20:28] but the altar is here
[1:20:31] and the only way that you'll ever offer
[1:20:33] God the right thing on this altar
[1:20:35] is you've got to have a revelation
[1:20:38] without a revelation It all becomes
[1:20:40] mechanics
[1:20:42] and Cain cannot satisfy him with
[1:20:43] mechanics
[1:20:45] the Jews could not satisfy him with
[1:20:47] mechanics
[1:20:48] the Pharisees could not satisfy him with
[1:20:51] mechanics
[1:20:52] we will not satisfy him
[1:20:55] with mechanics are you follow me let me
[1:20:57] keep going birth pains watch brother bam
[1:20:59] says
[1:21:00] Jesus said that his word was a seed that
[1:21:03] a source wouldn't so forth or so
[1:21:06] now we're all acquainted with that
[1:21:08] I want to teach this like a Sunday
[1:21:10] school lesson he said because it's
[1:21:11] Sunday notice then the word being a seed
[1:21:15] and remember the seed is only bringing
[1:21:18] forth a new life when it dies
[1:21:22] now watch this now
[1:21:24] my whole thing is the sacrifice upon the
[1:21:28] altar the sacrifices only accepted
[1:21:31] when it's dead
[1:21:33] it's got to give forth life it's got to
[1:21:36] give forth blood
[1:21:37] the blood on the altar signifies the
[1:21:40] death and that's what God received
[1:21:43] brother Brown talked about how the word
[1:21:45] is a seed but even the word
[1:21:48] can only bring forth when it dies and I
[1:21:51] want this or seed the natural seed can
[1:21:52] only bring forth when it dies Naturally
[1:21:53] Speaking
[1:21:54] and that's the reason it was hard for
[1:21:57] those Pharisees to understand our Lord
[1:21:58] Jesus Christ
[1:21:59] because they were under the law and the
[1:22:02] law was the word of God In seed form
[1:22:05] but when the word was made flesh
[1:22:08] and became not law but Grace now Grace
[1:22:12] and law cannot exist at the same time
[1:22:15] now I'm going to take my time I want you
[1:22:17] to catch that there was a season where
[1:22:19] the word was a seed
[1:22:23] but where the Pharisees struggle was
[1:22:25] when the seed became flesh
[1:22:29] they can all debate to see brother
[1:22:31] Simmons because as long as the seed form
[1:22:33] I think Moses meant this well I think
[1:22:36] Daniel meant this the seed form every
[1:22:38] man was entitled
[1:22:40] his opinion
[1:22:41] but when God interpreted his own word
[1:22:44] and made it flesh
[1:22:46] that's not subject to any man's
[1:22:48] interpretation because God's Vindicated
[1:22:50] his interpretation
[1:22:53] that's why the prophet said a prophet's
[1:22:55] message can't be questioned because he
[1:22:57] comes as the interpretation of the word
[1:22:59] for that age
[1:23:01] you could deter you could you could you
[1:23:02] could you can judge a gift he said but
[1:23:04] not a prophet why because he is the
[1:23:06] interpretation of God's word for the age
[1:23:08] now I want you to watch this I profit is
[1:23:10] on a seed
[1:23:12] brother Gordon
[1:23:14] but is it going to stay a seed forever
[1:23:19] is it going to remain a seed forever
[1:23:22] that man can debate doctrines
[1:23:25] I think women got to dress like this I
[1:23:27] think she got dressed like this
[1:23:29] I think a preacher can preach 45 minutes
[1:23:31] I think I was good enough
[1:23:35] I think we should have communion twice a
[1:23:37] year I said have an office come together
[1:23:41] it's a seed
[1:23:44] but when I take that apple seed
[1:23:46] and find good ground and plant it
[1:23:50] oh man that was a peach
[1:23:52] oh it was watermelon
[1:23:54] I said it's a cantaloupe
[1:23:56] hang around
[1:23:59] when that becomes Flash
[1:24:01] and manifesting bears his own fruit you
[1:24:04] can auger all you want us as a piece the
[1:24:07] tree will declare it was an apple
[1:24:13] or you following me now watch this the
[1:24:16] only way to get there
[1:24:17] is there's got to be a sacrifice
[1:24:20] the human being has to recognize we got
[1:24:23] Canary brains
[1:24:25] no matter how much we try to stay to
[1:24:26] this thing and line it up
[1:24:28] it can come ever so close all it's got
[1:24:30] to be is one Speck off and it's rejected
[1:24:34] it'll be so close it will deceive the
[1:24:37] very elect if it was possible but men
[1:24:39] are trying to take intellect and put
[1:24:40] line up online precept it wasn't
[1:24:42] intended to connect that way the only
[1:24:44] thing that could connect the dots is the
[1:24:46] Holy Ghost
[1:24:48] and he does it by taking it and
[1:24:50] manifesting his own words
[1:24:53] then all the games say is brother
[1:24:55] Simmons become quiet
[1:24:57] why because it's not a man no more
[1:25:00] God is there vindicating what he meant
[1:25:02] when he said thus he's vindicating what
[1:25:05] he meant when he said this and when this
[1:25:07] bride takes the skies that's going to be
[1:25:08] my uh uh uh Zion Showdown God's going to
[1:25:12] vindicate what he meant about a bride's
[1:25:13] Revival he's going to vindicate what he
[1:25:15] meant about the third pool why it'll be
[1:25:17] in Flash
[1:25:19] you won't need any more interpretations
[1:25:22] but it's only for a small group let me
[1:25:24] think I don't want to hold you too long
[1:25:27] it became not the law but Grace
[1:25:30] now Grace and law cannot exist at the
[1:25:32] same time
[1:25:33] could Grace is far more Above the Law
[1:25:35] the law is not even in the picture and
[1:25:37] therefore it's so hard for the Pharisees
[1:25:39] to die to their law so that Grace could
[1:25:42] be born
[1:25:43] but it must go
[1:25:45] the two laws cannot exist at the same
[1:25:47] time
[1:25:48] there's a sowing time
[1:25:51] and there's a manifestation time
[1:25:53] but in the showing time men get so
[1:25:55] caught up in their own ideas or what was
[1:25:57] sown
[1:25:58] that when God is ready to interpret it
[1:26:01] they're not listened willing to die
[1:26:04] on the altar
[1:26:06] that God's work and live
[1:26:09] they're too tied down to what they think
[1:26:12] to accept what God is now ready to
[1:26:15] manifest
[1:26:16] are you follow me let me go a little
[1:26:17] further I'll let you I'm Gonna Let You
[1:26:19] Go
[1:26:21] let me skip down some of this
[1:26:24] the word can only produce Christ
[1:26:28] as we're willing to let the word
[1:26:31] manifest in US
[1:26:33] the heart has to be open
[1:26:36] to accept the seed
[1:26:38] in order for the seed to come in listen
[1:26:40] and manifest itself
[1:26:42] that's why brother Bram said you have to
[1:26:44] die to your thinking because as long as
[1:26:45] you're holding on to your thinking
[1:26:47] you're closing the womb
[1:26:49] and the seed can't come in God's not
[1:26:51] going to come in and fight with your
[1:26:52] thinking we've got to be willing to die
[1:26:54] to our thinking that there's a fresh
[1:26:57] wound that God's seed can be planted in
[1:27:00] how do we offer this sacrifice
[1:27:02] Paul said present your bodies
[1:27:06] a Living Sacrifice
[1:27:08] holy and acceptable unto God which is a
[1:27:11] reasonable service
[1:27:12] that you might do listen prove
[1:27:15] by him coming in you because you're dead
[1:27:18] are you living sacrifice you're dead now
[1:27:21] you're not using your thinking you're
[1:27:22] not using your ideas all you giving God
[1:27:24] is your body you're not giving me your
[1:27:26] mind because your mind's you're going to
[1:27:27] that you're giving God your body and now
[1:27:30] God comes in your body listen and takes
[1:27:32] that body and he begins to come in you
[1:27:34] and he begins to interpret his word in
[1:27:37] you that you might prove
[1:27:40] what the promise was all about
[1:27:42] amen you might prove what the good and
[1:27:45] acceptable and perfect will of God was
[1:27:46] not what some church says but what God
[1:27:49] has demonstrated but not in the seed
[1:27:51] anymore but the seed is becoming flesh
[1:27:53] in your Immortal body
[1:27:55] but let me get a little a little further
[1:27:57] now and I'm Gonna Let You Go
[1:27:59] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:28:00] cut this out my wife tell me don't tell
[1:28:02] them people you'll let them go if you
[1:28:03] let them go
[1:28:10] I'm gonna read you a couple of quotes
[1:28:13] stop
[1:28:17] in the message birth pains
[1:28:19] you see
[1:28:22] what I've been
[1:28:24] hungry for
[1:28:26] is Revival
[1:28:30] I've seen in a church
[1:28:32] and I've seen God move I've seen people
[1:28:34] heal I've seen people saved
[1:28:36] I've seen marriages made up again
[1:28:39] I appreciate every bit that God's done
[1:28:43] but that wasn't the promise of the age
[1:28:46] if you've heard the voice of God in this
[1:28:48] last day
[1:28:49] you know there's something coming
[1:28:50] brother Brandon said listen the world
[1:28:53] has never seen
[1:28:55] even our Lord Jesus Christ when he was
[1:28:57] here brother bam said he had the power
[1:28:58] in him but wouldn't use it
[1:29:02] he said Greater Works than this shall ye
[1:29:05] do
[1:29:07] brother I'm saying the message Shalom I
[1:29:09] used to preach he meant more works
[1:29:12] he said but I realize now I was wrong
[1:29:14] when he said greater he meant what he
[1:29:16] said he meant greater
[1:29:18] he saved the best brother Simmons
[1:29:21] for the last
[1:29:24] he was going to lie the Holy Spirit to
[1:29:26] do more in his bride
[1:29:28] that he did in his own Ministry
[1:29:32] in the message of hidden life he said
[1:29:34] it's coming from Power
[1:29:36] that even the archangels hadn't seen
[1:29:38] you're saying a whole lot brother
[1:29:40] but it's LED just ahead for the
[1:29:42] believing Church
[1:29:43] not for the believing prophets for the
[1:29:46] believing Church
[1:29:48] but it's going to take a people that's
[1:29:50] so dead to self that they laid upon for
[1:29:53] a God and so died out the self that
[1:29:55] they're hungry for one thing they said
[1:29:57] Lord I want to see you glorified in me
[1:30:01] in order for God to be glorified in
[1:30:03] Christ he had to lay up on all the
[1:30:05] Gethsemane and die that the father might
[1:30:07] be glorified in the son and if the Sun
[1:30:10] is going to be glorified the bride she's
[1:30:12] got to Die the same way her Lord died
[1:30:16] brother said Jesus died and move on the
[1:30:18] sin that he did on Calvary because the
[1:30:20] consume is where he farted out
[1:30:23] and said God not my will
[1:30:25] not my thinking my thinking of it
[1:30:28] another way Lord I'm not sure I read
[1:30:29] Isaiah I know what he said
[1:30:32] is there another way but not my will
[1:30:36] thine will be done he was willing to die
[1:30:39] out despite the pain he knew it was
[1:30:41] going to come upon him
[1:30:43] what keeps us from dying out sometimes
[1:30:45] we think about the pain well if I died
[1:30:47] and let if I do that Lord
[1:30:49] you know that's gonna cost me
[1:30:51] oh Lord if I if the Lord if I if if if I
[1:30:54] cope with that Lord you know what that's
[1:30:56] gonna cost me
[1:30:57] but die not is not easy a sacrifice
[1:31:00] don't sit there and say cut me again
[1:31:03] no no wait a minute hold on get me on
[1:31:05] this side
[1:31:07] that sacrifice wants to live and you
[1:31:10] gotta hold it there while you cut it
[1:31:15] it's painful
[1:31:17] but it brings forth if it if you do it
[1:31:19] it brings forth New Life
[1:31:22] because this sacrifice has a promise to
[1:31:24] it if we're willing to die
[1:31:27] then God's life in US
[1:31:29] can be made manifest
[1:31:31] birth pains
[1:31:32] brother Brown said we know the old seed
[1:31:35] it must die before the new seed can come
[1:31:36] out of your seed it must absolutely not
[1:31:39] only die but rot after it's dead we know
[1:31:42] that's true the same thing is with new
[1:31:44] birth
[1:31:46] will never go back but we go forward
[1:31:48] when you're born again that's why I
[1:31:51] think today we have so many or not so
[1:31:53] many I should say rather genuine news
[1:31:55] births is because the seed maybe will
[1:31:57] sympathize listen will sympathize with
[1:32:00] the word or the person but they don't
[1:32:02] want to rot away from the old system
[1:32:04] that they win
[1:32:06] they're willing to go so far with the
[1:32:08] word
[1:32:09] but to let go of everything they think
[1:32:13] well I know I'm right about
[1:32:18] that what about that right there well uh
[1:32:19] that might be for you but
[1:32:28] not just repeat the most famous
[1:32:30] congregations
[1:32:34] that God showed him
[1:32:39] God has established a messenger whether
[1:32:41] it be Pastor priests I mean Pastor
[1:32:44] Prophet evangelist teacher if he's
[1:32:46] anointed by God and I give you his
[1:32:48] thoughts
[1:32:49] he's actually bringing you brother
[1:32:50] Birmingham said that's God's dress where
[1:32:52] to bring you the word
[1:32:55] but what I'm finding is that the people
[1:32:56] are just as much divided
[1:32:58] as the ministry are
[1:33:00] because they're making the same mistake
[1:33:02] we all got our thoughts listen brother
[1:33:04] Mike ain't immune
[1:33:05] I ain't said brother Mike got it all
[1:33:07] right but I'm getting before God is
[1:33:09] saying God what I don't have right God
[1:33:10] I'm asking to have mercy show me
[1:33:14] that's all I'm saying I'm not saying you
[1:33:16] gotta go out there and kick yourself and
[1:33:17] say I don't know what I'm talking about
[1:33:18] if God shows you something you hold on
[1:33:19] to it and show you something better but
[1:33:21] you got to be humble enough listen
[1:33:23] to recognize sometimes
[1:33:26] we could be wrong
[1:33:30] you follow me
[1:33:31] sometime we can be wrong
[1:33:34] but if we're not willing to let go to
[1:33:36] thought like the Pharisees to recognize
[1:33:38] what they were wrong they could never
[1:33:40] receive Christ and we're not going to
[1:33:42] receive this great promise of a body
[1:33:43] change if we're holding on to something
[1:33:45] that's not scriptural because that word
[1:33:47] that bride gets out of here she's going
[1:33:48] to be a word right
[1:33:57] just once more
[1:34:03] Samson
[1:34:05] to me typifies
[1:34:08] at least what I'm experiencing
[1:34:11] Samson
[1:34:13] was called to God
[1:34:15] Samson was the elect of God
[1:34:19] Samson was to manifest the word for that
[1:34:21] age
[1:34:22] he was a judge that God had chosen
[1:34:25] but Samson made a mistake
[1:34:28] for the Bible said he gave himself part
[1:34:31] of himself to God
[1:34:32] but listen
[1:34:34] he didn't give him all himself to God
[1:34:37] he gave his body to the Holy Spirit
[1:34:40] but he gave his heart to Delilah
[1:34:42] Delilah represented the world
[1:34:45] there were just some things of the world
[1:34:47] Samson could just not let go of
[1:34:50] I won't get into that we could we could
[1:34:51] talk about it I'm getting into that
[1:34:54] but what it did was it cost him
[1:34:57] he had to pay a price for it
[1:34:59] and I want you to get this
[1:35:01] God had raised Samson up for a purpose
[1:35:05] God was going to fulfill his word
[1:35:08] Samson only had to pay a price for his
[1:35:10] mistakes
[1:35:11] but it had nothing to do with what God
[1:35:13] called him for
[1:35:15] Moses killed a man and went away for 40
[1:35:17] years he made a mistake
[1:35:19] that had nothing to do with the call in
[1:35:20] his life God was going to fulfill his
[1:35:22] word or you follow me
[1:35:24] Jonah got on the boat to tarshas instead
[1:35:27] of an interview
[1:35:28] but God was going to fulfill his word
[1:35:31] the bride sometimes can make mistakes
[1:35:35] she can get off path
[1:35:37] but if she's willing to Humble herself
[1:35:40] and come back like Abraham did Abraham
[1:35:42] came back to that same altar
[1:35:45] if we're willing to come back to that
[1:35:47] same altar of self-sacrifice that you
[1:35:49] had when you first got saved and the
[1:35:51] only thing that mattered to you was the
[1:35:52] move of the Holy Ghost and God in your
[1:35:53] life and that was the only thing that
[1:35:55] mattered
[1:35:55] you'll see a Revival means to bring
[1:35:57] something back
[1:35:59] is not pouring out something new per se
[1:36:02] but it's to restore that something that
[1:36:04] has been lost something that was there
[1:36:05] to revive it and bring it back again
[1:36:08] I'm looking for Revival in this church
[1:36:10] not to understand the church I'm not
[1:36:11] talking about his building I'm talking
[1:36:12] about the bride
[1:36:14] and I count myself as a part of that and
[1:36:16] I'm saying Lord I want to see more of
[1:36:18] God than I ever seen Lord whatever I've
[1:36:20] done to hold you up Lord let me get out
[1:36:22] of the way let me bring myself back to
[1:36:24] this altar let me come back to this
[1:36:26] place and let me die right here that you
[1:36:28] might be glorified
[1:36:30] but it's going to take a people that's
[1:36:32] going to recognize not some lamb on it
[1:36:34] also but you got to come back and place
[1:36:36] yourself under y'all
[1:36:40] this is where I'm losing
[1:36:42] just once more Lord I got three quotes
[1:36:45] but I'm going to read one of them
[1:36:46] because you got the point
[1:36:48] raise your hand if you got the point
[1:36:51] they might just want me to sit down
[1:36:57] God is looking for a people
[1:37:00] that have heard the truth
[1:37:02] Samson knew the will of God he didn't
[1:37:05] need somebody to come down and preach on
[1:37:07] the seven sealed
[1:37:11] heard that so many times I could preach
[1:37:13] that myself
[1:37:15] but what he needed brother Simmons was
[1:37:17] to put himself on the altar
[1:37:19] that's all
[1:37:20] and this time you put yourself in altar
[1:37:22] don't put yourself on pick it back up
[1:37:23] again like that lamb get up and take it
[1:37:25] down
[1:37:26] yeah
[1:37:28] put it down so I'm not moving until it's
[1:37:29] dead
[1:37:30] you understand
[1:37:32] now watch Samson
[1:37:34] he wanted God's word manifested
[1:37:36] before that Jezebel more than he wanted
[1:37:38] his own life
[1:37:41] you see this world is getting so dead
[1:37:43] I hope all of us feel that way I hope
[1:37:45] there's I hope there's nothing out there
[1:37:46] we see that's so attracted to us to say
[1:37:48] Lord give me five more years
[1:37:51] Lord give me just give me enough time if
[1:37:53] I can just get this money saved up I
[1:37:55] could get that house I've been wanting
[1:37:56] all my life
[1:37:58] it's gonna burn one day
[1:38:00] well don't get me wrong if you can get a
[1:38:01] house get it
[1:38:03] if the Lord blessed me tomorrow with
[1:38:04] enough money give new houses up next
[1:38:05] time you come back I might bring you
[1:38:06] pictures
[1:38:08] I ain't preaching against nobody getting
[1:38:09] a new house if God bless you get it but
[1:38:12] don't let that be your joy
[1:38:14] don't let Betty a thing you're holding
[1:38:15] on to let the thing you be holding on to
[1:38:17] his Lord I want to see this word
[1:38:19] manifested
[1:38:21] and if I got to let that house go to get
[1:38:22] it then let it go
[1:38:25] you know the sister I met with yesterday
[1:38:27] I was talking about I was crying to that
[1:38:28] bible study
[1:38:30] she's looking at her husband looking for
[1:38:32] a church
[1:38:33] they live in Charleston North side of
[1:38:36] Charleston 12 Columbia
[1:38:38] and they're having car trouble
[1:38:40] and her job she has to work on Sunday
[1:38:43] afternoon she can go to Sunday morning
[1:38:45] service in Charleston but she don't have
[1:38:47] enough time to get off out of church
[1:38:49] to draft a distancing you know if if she
[1:38:52] works somewhere far away so a job in
[1:38:54] order to get there she's got to stay
[1:38:55] with a local church
[1:38:57] and I knew that before I had the Bible
[1:38:58] study with him because I've known the
[1:39:00] couple for a while
[1:39:01] and I was telling the brother that I was
[1:39:02] going to Bible study with me to help me
[1:39:04] out the Bible study I said you know
[1:39:07] something's got to change but that's
[1:39:08] just a job
[1:39:10] I said I don't know it's got to change
[1:39:11] but that's that's that's really
[1:39:12] hindering them
[1:39:13] from being to church but I know they
[1:39:15] want to be there
[1:39:16] I said somewhere somebody's got to make
[1:39:18] a sacrifice
[1:39:20] and she had a job a management position
[1:39:21] she had for 17 years but that job
[1:39:23] required her to work every Sunday
[1:39:25] afternoon
[1:39:26] when we said in a Bible study she said
[1:39:27] brother Holloway
[1:39:29] she said I put my notice in on my job
[1:39:32] she said I just left it after 17 years I
[1:39:34] left it
[1:39:35] she said I just got hired with another
[1:39:36] company
[1:39:37] and then they said what do you require
[1:39:40] she says I require one thing
[1:39:42] I'm not working on Sundays
[1:39:44] she was tired of that brother Simmons
[1:39:46] she was crying because she was hungry
[1:39:48] for God
[1:39:49] and if that job is keeping me from being
[1:39:51] in the house of God I'd rather leave
[1:39:52] that job
[1:39:54] because I'm hungry for God
[1:39:59] that meant every bit of the six hours I
[1:40:01] had to drive to drive three hours there
[1:40:02] and three hours home last night and
[1:40:04] that's one reason I didn't get to study
[1:40:05] like I wanted to but maybe I didn't need
[1:40:07] to maybe God said I don't want you
[1:40:08] studying too hard nowhere because I got
[1:40:09] something else I want you to talk about
[1:40:10] I've been staying on something else last
[1:40:12] night
[1:40:12] but it was worth every bit of that drive
[1:40:15] to see that sisters I know and I knew
[1:40:17] her husband was solid he's already
[1:40:18] stirred you know but his wife was kind
[1:40:21] of dragging a little bit
[1:40:22] but to see God dealing with her
[1:40:25] and she said I just want to know what I
[1:40:27] got to do I said sister don't do nothing
[1:40:28] but keep trusting God
[1:40:30] I said this is not something a man can
[1:40:32] do for you
[1:40:33] same holy ghost that put that on your
[1:40:34] heart to turn that other job in and to
[1:40:37] tell the next job I'll take it as long
[1:40:38] as I can be home on Sundays because
[1:40:40] something in your heart says I need God
[1:40:43] and that's what we got to get to now I'm
[1:40:45] closing on this now watch I'm gonna read
[1:40:47] it
[1:40:49] he says Samson desired to see God's word
[1:40:52] manifested more than his own life
[1:40:58] if the if that desire could come into
[1:41:00] the church again
[1:41:02] yea he wasn't praying for a new order or
[1:41:06] a new denomination but that the word of
[1:41:08] God might be made known again the
[1:41:10] promise that he once had might come back
[1:41:13] on him again he was aware of what would
[1:41:16] happen if his prayer was answered but he
[1:41:19] was ready and in dead a dead earnest
[1:41:23] Samson said let me die
[1:41:26] with the Philistines if I've got to put
[1:41:29] myself on the altar
[1:41:32] to see God's word may manifest and so be
[1:41:35] it let me die that I might die but I'm
[1:41:37] going
[1:41:39] to see the king
[1:41:42] when the church gets that desperation
[1:41:44] we're going to see a Revival
[1:41:48] that's all God's waiting for the word is
[1:41:51] here the power is here but there's got
[1:41:53] to be a people ready to put themselves
[1:41:55] on the altar
[1:41:59] it might be one in his church
[1:42:01] I press everybody in this church
[1:42:04] I pray I'm one of them
[1:42:07] but I'm hungry musicians can come
[1:42:09] I'm hungry
[1:42:11] I want to see that Revival
[1:42:13] the word has prophesied
[1:42:18] the last time I was here
[1:42:20] I made a statement I said I believe
[1:42:21] World War III has started
[1:42:24] Russia had just entered Ukraine
[1:42:26] now that was my opinion back then
[1:42:28] I don't think it's an opinion no more
[1:42:30] now the world is talking about is this
[1:42:32] world war three
[1:42:35] China and Iran and Russia have teamed up
[1:42:40] United States France Germany and England
[1:42:43] have teamed up
[1:42:45] they're drenching down they're driving
[1:42:46] down their Stakes
[1:42:48] we're driving down now States what is
[1:42:50] that a build up to world war three
[1:42:54] the prophet said the last event
[1:42:56] that's going to annihilate everything
[1:42:58] it's going to be a third world war he
[1:43:00] said it won't be one fault with tanks on
[1:43:01] a battlefield this time he said they're
[1:43:03] gonna be shooting missiles through the
[1:43:04] air
[1:43:05] the world is there
[1:43:07] but we had a promise brother Simmons
[1:43:11] if I'm ready in that hour
[1:43:14] if I put myself
[1:43:16] so on the altar
[1:43:19] that there's nothing between me and God
[1:43:21] I'm dead to self
[1:43:22] and Christ is not living in me
[1:43:25] to interpret his own word
[1:43:27] his word said this
[1:43:30] that before one bomb
[1:43:33] drops
[1:43:35] if I'm that worried
[1:43:37] the word said before one bomb drops the
[1:43:42] elect
[1:43:43] will be out of here
[1:43:46] I want to be that word
[1:43:49] but I can't be that word holding on to
[1:43:51] my own thinking
[1:43:52] I can't be that word Holding On My Own
[1:43:53] attitudes I can't be that word hold on
[1:43:56] to my own desires I got to be like my
[1:43:58] lamb was Christ went to that garden and
[1:44:00] stayed there until he was dead to self
[1:44:02] then God was glorified in him Lord let
[1:44:04] me do the same thing
[1:44:06] let me see the pop remember I said
[1:44:08] Samson saw the possibilities
[1:44:11] and then he prayed dead earnest
[1:44:15] let us do the same let's bow his
[1:44:18] that's about his
[1:44:24] the heavenly father
[1:44:27] All I Want to Thank You for Your Grace
[1:44:31] I want to thank you for your word
[1:44:34] your written word
[1:44:37] you've Vindicated word of this hour
[1:44:40] it's not two different words
[1:44:42] it's one word Lord
[1:44:45] one was seed form
[1:44:48] now we're seeing the other one made in
[1:44:49] manifest
[1:44:52] what I'm asking first you forgive me
[1:44:56] Lord where I've disappointed you
[1:44:58] where I failed you
[1:45:00] where I've done not done that which I
[1:45:02] know that you ordained me to do
[1:45:05] but Lord I know like Samson
[1:45:08] he recognized he had fallen short before
[1:45:10] but he recognized there was a god of
[1:45:11] Mercy
[1:45:13] and he recognized there was another
[1:45:14] chance
[1:45:15] for that same spirit for the last
[1:45:17] Revival
[1:45:18] to come back one more time
[1:45:21] Lord I'm asking that you report that
[1:45:22] Spirit upon us again
[1:45:24] let us be so dead to self
[1:45:27] so dead to this world that the only
[1:45:29] thing we desire is to see your word
[1:45:30] Vindicated
[1:45:33] because Lord I know you're going to do
[1:45:34] it
[1:45:36] we're just saying lost maybe we find
[1:45:38] favor in your sight
[1:45:39] that we'll be a part of that vindication
[1:45:42] whatever he had virus in any desire said
[1:45:44] Lord
[1:45:46] I know I need a Revival
[1:45:49] maybe you've enjoyed church nothing
[1:45:51] wrong with that
[1:45:53] you might even enjoy the preaching this
[1:45:55] message there's nothing wrong with that
[1:45:57] but I'm not talking about that
[1:45:59] I'm talking about a Revival so stirred
[1:46:01] in your heart that the only thing you
[1:46:03] desire to see God's word may manifest in
[1:46:05] your mortal life if you're hungry for
[1:46:07] that just raise your hand before say God
[1:46:09] that's what I'm hungry for I want to see
[1:46:11] you come inside of me and interpret your
[1:46:14] own word to make that word manifest not
[1:46:16] a word and Seed form but now seed May
[1:46:19] manifest in mortal flesh Lord I'm
[1:46:21] raising my hand with them
[1:46:23] Lord I'm hungry for it Lord you know
[1:46:25] I've I've been crying out Lord because
[1:46:26] I'm Desiring to see something I know
[1:46:28] it's an hour and Lord I know there's a
[1:46:30] promise and I'm just Desiring Lord to
[1:46:32] see that promise made manifest again
[1:46:34] Lord bless the work here bless the
[1:46:36] pastor bless the ministry Lord bless
[1:46:38] every seed of God that's being sown here
[1:46:40] and Lord May there be the heart of God
[1:46:42] to receive it that you might make that
[1:46:44] word manifest Lord let us believe you're
[1:46:46] the one that's able and Lord you
[1:46:48] promised not by power nor by might but
[1:46:50] Lord it'll only be made manifest by the
[1:46:52] Holy Spirit that's given the word Lord
[1:46:54] we thank you for it
[1:46:56] Lord commit everybody into your hands
[1:46:58] in Jesus Christ's name
[1:47:01] May the bride Say Amen

[1:54:25] foreign
[1:54:37] just want to say something you know for
[1:54:39] brother Mike you know he said how he had
[1:54:41] different thoughts on his mind and Lord
[1:54:43] would lead him this way and the other
[1:54:44] way well there's a song that me and
[1:54:47] Pandora had talked about singing had
[1:54:49] listened to it numerous time I couldn't
[1:54:50] quite get it right but I said to myself
[1:54:52] next time Charlotte isn't here I'ma tell
[1:54:54] Pandora let's sing that song Because
[1:54:56] Charlotte wasn't here a couple of times
[1:54:57] but I didn't know ahead of time that she
[1:54:59] wasn't going to be here just text
[1:55:00] Pandora and I said uh well I took both
[1:55:02] of them I said Charlie you gonna be here
[1:55:04] today so Pandora answered no she's going
[1:55:05] to Sumter and Pandora end up saying
[1:55:07] something about another song and I never
[1:55:08] said anything to Pandora about let's go
[1:55:11] ahead and try to do that this morning
[1:55:12] even I went to her house we still didn't
[1:55:13] practice or nothing brother Mike started
[1:55:16] preaching the name of the song is a
[1:55:17] widow with nothing
[1:55:19] and it went just writing on with the
[1:55:21] word so brother even though you know you
[1:55:22] didn't know which way to go I know I
[1:55:25] should have you know followed
[1:55:26] that voice you know telling us to sing
[1:55:28] that next time she's not here to sing
[1:55:30] that song and it you know when it went
[1:55:32] right along with your same I just
[1:55:33] appreciate the Lord for working it out
[1:55:36] y'all pray for us
[1:55:40] okay it might be not quite like Trinidad
[1:55:57] there was nothing left
[1:56:02] just a little bit of oil that was all
[1:56:06] she had her situation like hopeless
[1:56:11] life was empty
[1:56:16] the fire that she had was gone and she
[1:56:20] could no longer sustain her family
[1:56:26] a widow with nothing
[1:56:30] she was a widow with nothing
[1:56:35] that was a story
[1:56:39] with the credit to approaching
[1:56:44] in her most desperate time of these she
[1:56:48] stood all along oh no friend no family
[1:56:54] and the red of their tall days
[1:57:00] you cannot pay your debt your children
[1:57:03] I'll become a ransom and they shall be
[1:57:07] taken
[1:57:08] she cried Lord I have nothing left
[1:57:13] I'm a widow with nothing
