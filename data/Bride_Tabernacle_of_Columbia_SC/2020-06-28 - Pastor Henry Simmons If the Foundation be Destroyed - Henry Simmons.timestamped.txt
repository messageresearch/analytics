[26:08] the different topics Amen a little bit
[26:12] of change this morning and talking about
[26:17] the the foundation be destroyed if the
[26:21] foundation be destroyed I think the
[26:25] devil has worked his work on the
[26:28] foundations and I believe that we see
[26:33] the effect Amen of the enemy amen and
[26:37] how he's crept in said he'll creep in
[26:41] unaware that he is crept in unaware
[26:48] so this morning songs 11 the one in the
[26:59] Lord put I my trust
[27:03] how sad ye to my soul flee as a bird to
[27:08] your Mountain below the wicked bend
[27:13] their bow they make ready their arrows
[27:17] upon the string that they may privily
[27:21] shoot at the upright in heart if the
[27:26] Foundation's be destroyed what can the
[27:30] righteous do the Lord is in his holy
[27:33] temple the Lord throne is in heaven
[27:38] his eyes behold the eyelid try the
[27:46] children of men the Lord tries the
[27:50] righteous but the wicked and him that
[27:54] loveth violin is so hated upon the
[28:00] wicked he shall rain snares fire and
[28:06] brimstone and a horrible TIPNIS this
[28:11] shall be the portion of their Cup for
[28:15] the righteous the Lord loveth the
[28:17] righteous his cabinets dude the whole
[28:22] they are right
[28:24] god bless the reading of his word you
[28:26] may be seated
[28:28] god is good amen
[28:32] so this morning as we talked about if
[28:40] Foundation's be destroyed what can the
[28:43] righteous do and songs eighty two and
[28:47] five it says they know not neither where
[28:51] they understand they walk in darkness
[28:54] and all the foundations of the earth are
[28:57] out of course all the foundation of the
[29:02] earth is out of course if the
[29:09] Foundation's be destroyed what can the
[29:15] righteous do I believe that we need
[29:23] strong and solid foundation I've seen
[29:31] structures down the foundation was off
[29:36] and the build of went full of the bill
[29:43] then when they lead the block of the
[29:47] building because the foundation was all
[29:52] it was not all able to hold the roof the
[29:59] building began to boom the walls began
[30:03] to begin to stretch out because the
[30:09] foundation was all course brother and
[30:14] sister we get ready to put the cops cone
[30:17] on the building and as we began to put
[30:20] the headstone and put the roof on which
[30:24] is perfect law then we began to put the
[30:28] count stone on the building and we'll
[30:31] find that the building cannot hold they
[30:36] meant in a clutch
[30:38] friend don't find out later that you are
[30:43] in a Clemson building talked about this
[30:53] foundation amen it's got to be solid
[30:59] it's got to be strong we talked about a
[31:04] suits superstructure building a strong
[31:08] foundation now I want to go to first
[31:14] Corinthians three very important that I
[31:20] take my time this morning I don't know
[31:22] whether or not I preach just talk to you
[31:26] a little bit a little bit now when we
[31:32] talk about foundation we're talking
[31:34] about the bottom support and it supports
[31:40] the wall it supports the building the
[31:44] superstructure and as we want to build a
[31:48] house and a temple for the law and then
[31:52] building a temple for the Lord then
[31:56] we've got to make sure that our
[31:58] foundation is solid amen
[32:04] usually we have architectural plans and
[32:09] it tells us how deep to build how wide
[32:13] the bill before we began to build and if
[32:20] the plans are correct
[32:24] then they make we can proceed if we've
[32:29] been checked out and expected I believe
[32:33] that
[32:34] the inspector comes and he inspects the
[32:38] foundation and I believe he looks at the
[32:43] architect plan and see whether or not
[32:46] the foundation is according to the plan
[32:49] I believe that the Oxitec plans is the
[32:55] Word of God but God's going to look at
[32:59] how we build his house and see whether
[33:05] now it's according to the architect plan
[33:08] and according to the world I believe
[33:13] there many folks that are building great
[33:18] structures outside superstructures
[33:27] looked at whole thousands and ten
[33:31] thousand to the temple of the Holy Ghost
[33:42] that's a difference God is gonna expect
[33:51] you and see when you bill according to
[33:56] the pattern Moses I want you to do it
[34:03] according to the pattern know according
[34:08] to the pattern brothers sister and we
[34:15] expect to survive the storm did not care
[34:22] to be build according to the directions
[34:26] the God had given because surely the
[34:31] rain was going to come the fog was going
[34:34] to come and the plans had to be right to
[34:39] survive
[34:41] no one coming stole what sanitize do
[34:57] this to that to survive this bar will
[35:08] try to survive in this world just to
[35:14] live a little longer suffer because
[35:18] we've not taken precautions I'm saying
[35:25] that young people seem to be because
[35:41] they're not taken precaution because
[35:44] they figure they'll survive and I want
[35:49] to say to you maybe that's your soul
[35:55] you're not taking precaution and concern
[36:00] about your soul my pregnant sister folks
[36:08] semen I'm not concerned about the old
[36:12] safety safety elders but I want you to
[36:22] know it's an individual journey now and
[36:27] I want you to be careful how you conduct
[36:31] your life because you might be a victim
[36:36] or destroy many souls so you must
[36:41] conduct your life in a way that you
[36:45] might win souls and not destroy
[36:50] he that winneth Souls is wise god bless
[36:57] you today 1st Corinthians 3 and 10 I'm
[37:06] talking about if the foundation be
[37:09] destroyed he said according to the grace
[37:14] of God which is given me as the wise
[37:21] masterbuilder I have what laid the
[37:27] foundation and another buildeth thereon
[37:31] but let every man take heed how he
[37:36] buildeth you know somebody said I don't
[37:41] have to believe what Paul preached they
[37:46] don't believe that Paul they meant was
[37:49] given his instructions by God amen but
[37:55] Paul said though we but a Jew come from
[37:59] heaven preach any other gospel then that
[38:03] which we preached he said to let him be
[38:05] accursed
[38:06] as the wise masterbuilder
[38:10] Paul says I suffer not a woman to teach
[38:15] nor the ocean authority over the man but
[38:19] to be in silence with all subjection but
[38:25] people say I don't have to listen to
[38:29] Paul amen
[38:32] I can do what God told me to do I'm
[38:38] gonna do what God told me that's what
[38:43] this Paul I don't know where he got his
[38:47] revelation from but I want you to know
[38:51] and not the blueprints even in the Word
[38:55] of God God is giving us what he wants us
[39:01] the God line
[39:03] in which he wants us to go by if we want
[39:07] to go to heaven and God has prepared
[39:10] away and Jesus declared I am the way the
[39:17] truth and the life no man can come to
[39:23] the Father except me come follow me
[39:26] you gotta come for Jesus and the Bible
[39:31] says in the beginning was the word the
[39:34] Word was with God and the Word was God
[39:39] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[39:44] among us hallelujah Jesus has already
[39:52] made the way plane I'm sorry you already

[46:30] Ghost and then the Spirit of God dwells
[46:34] in you that's what everybody claiming
[46:37] that God is in them they're claiming not
[46:42] but let's check your foundation even
[46:47] when God made the world by faith we
[46:51] believed that the world was framed by
[46:53] the Word of God and if the world had his
[46:58] foundation and it came by because of the
[47:02] Word of God all you would be he was in
[47:07] the world world was made by him God and
[47:14] he looked out and inside it was good
[47:17] don't even look at this one no he said
[47:26] it repeated God that he made me I wonder
[47:30] what God is doing now and they looked
[47:34] out a wicked world and look at the
[47:36] condition of mankind what'd he say he
[47:40] said in the days of no nation in the
[47:56] but why is it why is bad what kind of
[48:04] condition

[48:24] foundation of the home they destroy even
[48:30] what can the righteous do they may
[48:33] otherwise masterbuilder I'm lead the
[48:37] foundation the home may be said
[48:42] hopefully love your wife even as Christ
[48:46] also loved the church and gave himself
[48:50] for the home should consist of the
[48:56] mother and the father remember we have
[49:00] fallen victims he meant that we only
[49:03] help whoa what that was all a device of
[49:12] the enemy but take the man out of the
[49:16] house and the woman be left alone to
[49:20] rather children if the Foundation's be
[49:24] destroyed what can the righteous do our
[49:29] son brothers they make the children to
[49:40] be responsible for your seed because
[49:45] it's part of you
[49:49] they destroy what children do
[49:59] but it's it's or not that's us little
[50:05] signal the foundation we destroy its
[50:18] male and female are you up there for the
[50:24] purpose of reproduction reduce and bring
[50:34] forth women and women get a man a woman
[50:38] and a woman cannot reproduce
[50:42] he said wouldíve he said be fruitful and
[50:49] multiply
[50:50] are you whooping we're in a condition if
[50:56] the Foundation's be destroyed what can
[51:00] the righteous do the homes that's been
[51:08] failing in the home
[51:12] the foundation says they met for but
[51:18] wives the mothers to be teased they
[51:24] meant good people at home to read the
[51:29] children but if the Foundation's be
[51:33] destroyed what can the righteous do they
[51:38] know I believe personally they meant the
[51:45] word is right then we need to open where
[51:49] he said that if the Foundation's be
[51:53] destroyed what can the righteous do that
[51:57] women should be soldered to her must be
[52:05] sorted unto Christ are you
[52:10] for thy desire shall be to thy husband
[52:14] and he shall rule over you are you up
[52:18] there but we are taking and we destroy
[52:23] the foundation in the whole the
[52:27] foundation in marriage has been destroy
[52:31] the structure husband torn down it's
[52:35] been weakened I believe sometimes will
[52:42] mo concern about our welfare our future
[52:47] then our children but I thank God for
[52:52] the women and the sisters that will lead
[52:56] their careers to the side amen they were
[53:00] real their children are you up and bring
[53:06] them up in the nurture and admonition of
[53:09] the law I believe your responsibility
[53:13] they made as a wife is the radio's
[53:17] children I believe it's very important
[53:24] that the foundation of a child they mend
[53:30] the knee or with the mother and that
[53:35] model instructs the child in the nurture
[53:39] and admonition of the Lord
[53:41] and in the natural amen if the child
[53:45] does not know what and have a vision of
[53:50] what they want to do as it is in the
[53:54] military when you join the military you
[53:59] may not know what do you want to be a
[54:03] mechanic I wonder you want to be a drill
[54:07] sergeant computer what
[54:16] the army will give you tests and find
[54:20] out your ability I believe it's up to
[54:25] the model and the fact of father to
[54:31] determine the event to see what their
[54:35] child areas of weakness of the strength
[54:40] because they want the child to be
[54:43] successful so the parents will look into
[54:49] I've got to leave a good foundation so
[54:53] there's Todd wouldn't the baby mothers
[54:57] whoo
[54:59] read the Bible and telling them stories
[55:03] that when the baby comes forth they
[55:07] began to put them in an atmosphere where
[55:11] they can grow and when the child is big
[55:16] enough to say mommy I want to be a
[55:21] teacher
[55:23] mommy I want to be in our playing power
[55:28] my child began to say it may change but
[55:34] the mother has heard something to the
[55:38] child desire she needs from that time
[55:43] for to begin to quit that child with the
[55:48] thing that will cause them to be
[55:51] successful and if he can not master the
[55:55] skill then they need to find out where
[55:59] the structure I believe that will
[56:03] missing out because we are failing to
[56:07] leave us cold foundation while there's
[56:12] no vision the people perish wait about a
[56:19] child that wants to be a great singer
[56:23] but doesn't have the boys
[56:26] cannot hold it to the mother could get
[56:31] all kinds of teachers and all kind of
[56:34] scruffy but yet the child still feel I
[56:39] want you to know David that child needs
[56:44] to find the area in which they can be
[56:49] successfully but many times it doesn't
[56:54] matter if that Saul still thinks that I
[56:58] can see what everybody know you've got
[57:11] to get over to that child
[57:13] Unitas al what tell you it's difficult
[57:23] to do the job in school if the parents
[57:29] have not prepare their children for
[57:32] school and to find out that the teacher
[57:37] its failure faced with a responsibility
[57:41] to teach children that need parenting
[57:46] first so the teacher find themselves
[57:50] with the responsibility are trying to
[57:53] get the child to understand social
[57:57] skills they meant to understand
[58:01] responsibility and it's certain things
[58:05] that should have been lead down in the
[58:08] home my topics as I go down and laying
[58:16] the foundation I could stay all knocked
[58:20] off it for a little while but I believe
[58:24] I need to go on a little further
[58:29] we have schools that have failed because
[58:39] the children in school first second
[58:44] third grade the teachers sometimes miss
[58:49] and the parents at home miss so the
[58:54] children are trying to make it to school
[58:59] they cannot read don't know the
[59:06] timetables and they are in junior high
[59:10] school I won't didn't know that child's
[59:19] life has been damaged and when they try
[59:24] to be successful nine out of ten you're
[59:29] gonna find a child that's not able to
[59:33] cope with society and I believe when it
[59:38] comes down to the knocker so it is in
[59:42] the spiritual there are many instances
[59:46] where we find our social inadequate
[59:51] spiritually don't understand the
[59:56] spiritual things of God amen we're not
[1:00:01] able to comprehend the love of God we're
[1:00:05] not evil to understand the requirement
[1:00:09] of what God is required of us any more
[1:00:12] lies why because of the foundation it's
[1:00:18] something the final that a cow is in
[1:00:23] senior high school and still can't add
[1:00:28] in citrate how can that talk so far what
[1:00:35] children and what the family I want you
[1:00:40] to know
[1:00:41] somewhere along the line he meant will
[1:00:45] come amen into a society he meant that a
[1:00:50] nut folks past old through a mint but
[1:00:54] the child is not being helped I'm in the
[1:00:59] church will come to a place in the
[1:01:04] church that people are getting into the
[1:01:08] church friends of mine it's very easily
[1:01:16] saying that folks to get in to the
[1:01:21] wedding and Jesus looked around at those
[1:01:27] that were in the waiting fine worn in
[1:01:32] the wedding that didn't have a wedding
[1:01:35] garment any eczema the question how did
[1:01:40] you get in the wedding without a garment
[1:01:44] Oh somebody declared he must have come
[1:01:49] in through the wonder because I'm here
[1:01:52] to came by the door then he would have
[1:01:56] got his wedding gone and I'm saying to
[1:02:01] thee amen
[1:02:03] we have folks that got would come in by
[1:02:09] the water and that's what kind of
[1:02:13] garment he got on a meant that in coming
[1:02:17] in by the door that they would have been
[1:02:22] clothed and garner righteous but nice
[1:02:26] white garment which is the righteousness
[1:02:30] of God and I want you to know as I go
[1:02:35] back to song if the foundation they
[1:02:39] destroyed what can the righteous do
[1:02:44] revelation said that the white rules in
[1:02:48] the righteousness of the sink
[1:02:51] saying somebody order people fair they
[1:02:55] many Hornady that him and you ought to
[1:02:58] come in but a no what are you saying
[1:03:02] preacher he the knew no sin was made sin
[1:03:07] for us that we might be made the
[1:03:10] righteousness of God all you would be a
[1:03:16] man if you're not righteous then you've
[1:03:20] got to come by the blood and by the
[1:03:23] blood of Jesus that he makes us
[1:03:27] righteous in him what happens failure
[1:03:35] become to guard the right way the Bible
[1:03:40] says therefore let all the house of
[1:03:44] Israel nor surely that God has made that
[1:03:49] same Jesus whom you crucified the Lord
[1:03:54] in Christ when they heard this they were
[1:03:57] pricked in their heart it's not an
