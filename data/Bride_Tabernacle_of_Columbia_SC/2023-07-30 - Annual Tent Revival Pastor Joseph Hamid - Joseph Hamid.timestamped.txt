[47:52] the majority
[47:53] right Saints that have gone on beyond
[47:55] the grave and they've left us that
[47:57] doesn't mean they're gone it just means

[48:10] Beyond those places amen of Pearl and
[48:13] gold and there'll be Saints screaming

[48:17] then we'll realize let us see it wasn't
[48:19] in the majority can you say Amen to that
[48:21] amen let's just believe the Lord stand
[48:24] to your feet with me and listen prayer
[48:26] over these requests what a privilege
[48:29] it's been to be in the meetings we
[48:30] certainly have enjoyed ourselves and
[48:32] looking for more of the word of the Lord
[48:33] and for his presence as we go further
[48:35] father it is a privilege Lord Jesus to
[48:38] Bow our heads we thank you so very much
[48:41] for the great election of God
[48:43] for your choosing for your mind that has
[48:46] been poured out upon us as your people
[48:48] and Lord Jesus as we go on in time we
[48:51] can realize that diseases and troubles
[48:54] and famines and toils and perils and
[48:56] what more it'll come it'll come our way
[48:58] every time we turn Lord for these
[49:01] requests sick and Afflicted and battling
[49:04] all of the great diseases and problems
[49:06] of the day Lord we see it we know it's
[49:08] coming but Lord your Prophet taught us
[49:11] that Satan was here to put it on but the
[49:15] armies of the Living God were called to
[49:17] take it away and father we loose the
[49:19] power of God upon all of these requests
[49:22] every uplifted hand every spoken request
[49:24] and father we bind every evil spirit May
[49:28] the devil who cannot even afflict
[49:30] through spider bites or any other kind
[49:32] of Affliction Lord he's lost his power
[49:35] he is absolutely powerless he had his
[49:38] teeth knocked out in Calvary he has no
[49:41] mind just to Bart and Lord we adjure
[49:43] that devil in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:46] to let thy people go may they be loosed
[49:50] in their body loosed in their mind
[49:51] loosed in their Spirit loosed in their
[49:54] soul may Deliverance come every way that
[49:57] it needs to come as we believe you we
[49:59] commit it to you and we ask you for your
[50:02] favor in the name of the Lord Jesus

[1:29:38] this morning I'd like to go into a
[1:29:40] couple of places uh in the scriptures to
[1:29:43] lay the foundation for uh the message
[1:29:46] are you ready for the word
[1:29:49] and I'm just going to let the Lord have
[1:29:51] his way in this meeting today in
[1:29:55] and speak to you from from my heart and
[1:29:57] as the spirit of the Lord will give me
[1:29:59] unction this morning
[1:30:01] in the Book of Psalms chapter 1 18.
[1:30:14] and verses
[1:30:16] 22.
[1:30:27] okay
[1:30:32] now you understand that David is
[1:30:37] speaking now prophetically
[1:30:42] spirit of God has struck his innermost
[1:30:45] being and he's groaning under the
[1:30:48] inspiration and the anointing of the
[1:30:50] Holy Spirit
[1:30:52] and he cried out
[1:30:54] the stones which the builder refused
[1:31:00] has become The Headstone of the corner
[1:31:05] this is the Lord's doing
[1:31:07] it is marvelous
[1:31:10] in our eyes
[1:31:12] I want you to watch that carefully
[1:31:14] Matthew chapter 21
[1:31:24] beginning in verses 33 please
[1:32:01] if you have it say Amen
[1:32:05] what a blessing
[1:32:06] to be able to turn the scriptures and go
[1:32:10] right into the word of God
[1:32:13] here are not a parable there was a
[1:32:15] certain household which planted a
[1:32:17] Vineyard in a head Stitch round about
[1:32:19] and digged a VIN wine prestonage and
[1:32:23] built a tower and led it out to a
[1:32:26] husbandman and went into a far country
[1:32:30] and when the time of the fruit Drew near
[1:32:34] he sent the servant to the husbandman
[1:32:37] that he might receive the fruit of it
[1:32:41] and the husband took his servant and
[1:32:44] beat one and killed another and stoned
[1:32:46] another
[1:32:47] and again he sent another servant more
[1:32:50] than the first and they did unto him
[1:32:52] likewise At Last of all he sent unto
[1:32:57] them his son saying they will not
[1:33:00] Revenge my son but when the husband saw
[1:33:04] the son they said among themselves this
[1:33:07] is the heir come let us kill him and let
[1:33:10] us cease on the inheritance
[1:33:13] I want you to notice now that this
[1:33:16] this Parable is is very profound because
[1:33:19] it is portraying what God is doing in
[1:33:25] the last days
[1:33:27] he's portraying a people in this age
[1:33:30] that is out in the world
[1:33:33] that is filled with violence
[1:33:37] filled with uncertainties
[1:33:41] filled with a number of uh uh corruption
[1:33:46] agenda
[1:33:47] but I believe that there's a people that
[1:33:50] is sent in this age that will overcome
[1:33:54] overcome everything I believe that has
[1:33:57] been anointed and sent to destroy them
[1:34:02] right and I believe it's the Church of
[1:34:04] the Living God
[1:34:06] go down to Isaiah as I laid a foundation
[1:34:09] I want to make sure is that it's very
[1:34:12] secure
[1:34:22] we've read this the first night I
[1:34:25] minister
[1:34:27] Isaiah 53
[1:34:32] and verses 3.
[1:34:35] he is despised
[1:34:37] and rejected a man
[1:34:40] a man of sorrow
[1:34:42] and acquainted with grief
[1:34:44] we did hit as it were our faces from him
[1:34:47] he was despised and we esteemed him a
[1:34:53] notch
[1:34:54] first Peter and then we'll be seated
[1:35:04] well How Sweet It Is to trust in Jesus
[1:35:07] and to take him out his word
[1:35:11] second Peter
[1:35:15] 2 verses 5.
[1:35:21] our first Peter rather first Peter two
[1:35:23] I'm sorry
[1:35:28] he also as Lively stones are built up a
[1:35:31] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[1:35:33] offer up spiritual sacrifices accepted
[1:35:37] to God by Jesus Christ
[1:35:41] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:35:44] scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief
[1:35:47] Cornerstone elect
[1:35:49] precious
[1:35:51] and he that believeth on him shall not
[1:35:54] be confounded
[1:35:57] what a scripture aren't you therefore
[1:35:59] which believe he is precious but unto
[1:36:03] them which uh be disobedient the stone
[1:36:06] which the builders disallow the stone is
[1:36:10] made the head of the corner a stone of
[1:36:15] stumbling a rock of offense
[1:36:19] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:36:23] being disobedient unto also they were
[1:36:27] appointed where unto also they were
[1:36:30] appointed but ye are a chosen generation
[1:36:34] a royal priesthood
[1:36:37] hallelujah holy nation A peculiar people
[1:36:40] that he should show Force the Praises of
[1:36:45] him who had called you out of Darkness
[1:36:47] unto this marvelous
[1:36:51] light
[1:36:54] I wonder this morning that you may have
[1:36:56] a need if you'll just slip your hands up
[1:36:58] to God
[1:37:01] our heavenly father we come before you
[1:37:04] this morning
[1:37:06] we just want to thank you for your
[1:37:07] Amazing Grace
[1:37:09] we thank you for the fellowship that we
[1:37:11] feel today in the love divine
[1:37:14] we pray God that your sweet holy spirit
[1:37:16] will move across this congregation this
[1:37:20] morning and every need might be matched
[1:37:22] every hands that were lifted every sick
[1:37:26] will leave this billing holds those that
[1:37:29] are struggling internally will be healed
[1:37:32] by the power of the spoken word have
[1:37:35] your way in this meeting Lord bless the
[1:37:37] word as we now Venture into the
[1:37:39] scriptures Lord in the name of our Lord
[1:37:41] Jesus Christ and the church says
[1:37:44] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:37:54] I like to pull from these scriptures
[1:37:56] this morning a thought
[1:37:58] in a brother Isaiah saying the song that
[1:38:02] was a confirmation in my spirits
[1:38:05] to come up into the perfect word
[1:38:09] I believe that we live in an un
[1:38:11] imperfect world
[1:38:14] a religious world that's filled with
[1:38:17] ideology in theology
[1:38:21] man's Concepts traditions
[1:38:24] and religion
[1:38:26] but I believe in the midst of all of
[1:38:29] this that's that God has called out a
[1:38:33] people
[1:38:34] that is separated from all people of the
[1:38:39] land
[1:38:40] we are like the Israelites coming out of
[1:38:43] Egypt
[1:38:45] we are not like the Egyptians we're not
[1:38:49] of this world
[1:38:51] we can't seem to into society
[1:38:56] culture cannot capture Vape
[1:39:00] our minds and calls up to be conformed
[1:39:05] to their ideologies
[1:39:09] we are different we are a misfit in this
[1:39:12] Society
[1:39:14] we live in the world that somehow we
[1:39:17] feel that we somehow cannot blend into
[1:39:22] this dimension
[1:39:24] and this is because that there is a
[1:39:27] higher Dimension another form a
[1:39:31] theophany word Dimension that is trying
[1:39:35] to call us of voice that is calling us
[1:39:41] we try our best just to be a part of
[1:39:44] everything
[1:39:46] on the job with our families in our
[1:39:49] church in our societies
[1:39:52] how many of you as have went on to a job
[1:39:55] interview
[1:39:57] and somehow you didn't get the job
[1:40:01] and you received an email
[1:40:04] we thank you for the interview however
[1:40:09] you know when they say however you
[1:40:13] didn't get the job
[1:40:15] you didn't
[1:40:17] sits the criteria of what we were
[1:40:22] looking for
[1:40:23] you see the world is looking for a
[1:40:26] certain type of fish
[1:40:29] and the church is looking for a certain
[1:40:32] type of fit
[1:40:35] but somehow you can't fit in
[1:40:38] some of you hear you uh when growing up
[1:40:42] you you somehow came up into a family to
[1:40:46] where about Misfortune perhaps some of
[1:40:50] you don't know who your daddy is
[1:40:53] who your mama was
[1:40:55] you are put out on the streets
[1:40:58] some of you have had a background that's
[1:41:01] uh you would not even want to even talk
[1:41:03] about
[1:41:05] and excuse me for maybe going back into
[1:41:08] those paths just for a moment but I want
[1:41:12] to build on something to say your
[1:41:14] rejections
[1:41:17] you were rejected shh and I want to
[1:41:20] speak this morning on the rejected
[1:41:23] stones
[1:41:24] the rejected stones
[1:41:27] that did not fit in those that somehow
[1:41:31] can just be a part of everything that
[1:41:35] was going on
[1:41:36] there was a reason behind it you are a
[1:41:41] rejected Stone
[1:41:43] came out of the lines of God
[1:41:49] just give me a little moment here let me
[1:41:51] build and I'll preach to you
[1:41:54] Amen on the rejected stones
[1:41:57] in a message the prophet said in my
[1:42:00] travels I find that's it is the rejected
[1:42:04] stones that keeps the billing
[1:42:08] uh being fit together
[1:42:13] it's always
[1:42:15] the rejected shh
[1:42:17] it has always been the rejected
[1:42:21] it has always been those kinds that God
[1:42:25] somehow lay his hand upon their lives
[1:42:31] when you try to run from it
[1:42:33] when you try to forget it when you try
[1:42:37] to drug it out
[1:42:39] and you try to drink it out and you try
[1:42:42] to prostitute it out and you did
[1:42:45] everything in your life tried to drive
[1:42:49] that out somehow there was something
[1:42:52] there
[1:42:56] you know Jesus was rejected shh and it
[1:43:01] came from the most unlikely socialists
[1:43:05] he knew life
[1:43:08] he knew all about you what it feels like
[1:43:13] to be rejected
[1:43:15] yes he knows the life of an unjust a
[1:43:19] rejection
[1:43:20] he knows the pain and hurts caused by
[1:43:24] rejection from unlikely sources
[1:43:27] we've seen John 1 and 11 the Bible said
[1:43:31] he came to his own and his own received
[1:43:34] them notch I will speak to you in a
[1:43:37] moment
[1:43:37] I want to tell you that God's got a
[1:43:40] purpose for your life
[1:43:43] Hallelujah you might be rejected shh you
[1:43:47] might not fit in
[1:43:49] but you see the stone that the business
[1:43:52] rejected
[1:43:53] will become the Capstone in the states
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:44:00] Jesus is rejected by his own people
[1:44:05] rejected uh continually
[1:44:09] Jesus rejections continues throughout
[1:44:13] his ministry
[1:44:16] and I'm thoroughly studying for gospels
[1:44:19] right now and I noticed that in every
[1:44:24] campaign that Jesus had
[1:44:28] that they seem to be this battle of
[1:44:32] rejection against him
[1:44:35] and every meeting that he went into
[1:44:39] he felt the power of that rejection
[1:44:43] on the bulk of his rejection came from
[1:44:46] the unlikely sources those that claim to
[1:44:50] be the religious people of his day
[1:44:53] is she the religious people of Jesus day
[1:44:57] rejected him they failed to see that he
[1:45:02] was the Chief Cornerstone
[1:45:05] their eyes could not recognize the
[1:45:09] Christ unveiled before them
[1:45:12] but God had blinded their eyes
[1:45:15] that you and I can have eyes that we see
[1:45:18] today
[1:45:20] I believe they failed to see that he was
[1:45:24] that Cornerstone
[1:45:27] and I want to say today that God's
[1:45:29] elected our Lively stones
[1:45:32] rejected stones
[1:45:34] Revelation stones
[1:45:37] and for Century back these stones have
[1:45:40] been rejected and overlooked by the
[1:45:44] religious
[1:45:46] you know our persecution doesn't come
[1:45:49] from the unbelievers
[1:45:53] and comes from the religious
[1:45:57] those in a ranks those in our searches
[1:46:02] indulging our affiliations
[1:46:06] pillow somebody
[1:46:09] for centuries we have seen this pattern
[1:46:14] Moses was rejected by his own brethren
[1:46:18] cast aside
[1:46:20] but he had a message of Deliverance
[1:46:24] I want to say to you this morning it
[1:46:27] doesn't matter what you're facing
[1:46:29] What opposition is against you
[1:46:32] God has raised you up
[1:46:36] in your community
[1:46:38] and your family
[1:46:40] in your marriage young people hear me
[1:46:44] that you will be a deliverer
[1:46:50] you see the stone that was rejected
[1:46:53] became the Cornerstone of an exodus
[1:46:58] it was that religious system that was
[1:47:02] holding the people in bondage
[1:47:05] it was the religious
[1:47:08] pharaohs of those days that kept the
[1:47:12] people enslaved in their minds
[1:47:18] but it wasn't a rejected one that
[1:47:21] brought an exodus
[1:47:22] oh to those that did not look like much
[1:47:26] that did not have much
[1:47:28] that did not seem to fit in that a
[1:47:32] society that was around them
[1:47:35] they were the rejected Stone as Moses
[1:47:38] was but he led an exodus
[1:47:42] are you with me now
[1:47:45] you see Moses grew up in the wilderness
[1:47:47] was a rejected people
[1:47:49] down in Egypt
[1:47:51] beaten down under slavery
[1:47:55] Pharaoh looking out of this window and
[1:48:00] seeing the Israelites as nothing but you
[1:48:03] my Dabber
[1:48:06] they were seemed to have no value in
[1:48:09] their lives this is how Satan views us
[1:48:12] some time
[1:48:14] well does he realize
[1:48:16] that down
[1:48:17] side there's a germ seed that comes from
[1:48:22] God
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:24] so wonderful how Moses looked out of the
[1:48:28] same window and saw the same people as
[1:48:32] Lively stones of God
[1:48:34] those humor have been rejected
[1:48:38] cast out looked upon with shame and
[1:48:42] disgrace but yet God said I see purpose
[1:48:47] in their lives
[1:48:50] yes all Pharaoh saw was defeats
[1:48:54] Rejects
[1:48:56] but praise God Moses Moses saw victory
[1:49:01] instead of people who was once enslaved
[1:49:04] I became the head over all Israel
[1:49:08] led by the pitifier
[1:49:12] every saying God had in his plan and
[1:49:17] purpose was coming to a masterpiece
[1:49:22] manifestation
[1:49:24] and Joseph was rejected by his own
[1:49:27] Brethren is that correct
[1:49:29] his life types Christ in every aspect
[1:49:33] is seven color coats represents seven
[1:49:36] colors in a rainbow which was a covenant
[1:49:41] oh the Butcher and the baker one was
[1:49:45] refused and one was rejected
[1:49:49] like the two thieves on the cross
[1:49:52] and when he was dying make mention that
[1:49:55] his bones be taken out of Egypt
[1:49:58] a type of Christ leaving an empty tomb
[1:50:02] as an Evidence of his resurrection
[1:50:07] Joseph was given a gentile bride
[1:50:11] I'm laying the foundation to talk to
[1:50:15] your church
[1:50:19] Jesus
[1:50:20] after rejected by the Jews received a
[1:50:26] gentile bride
[1:50:28] prophesied by Jacob and the blessing of
[1:50:33] Joseph's two sons Ephraim and Manasseh
[1:50:37] he crossed his hand and the blessing
[1:50:41] went from the eldest to the youngest
[1:50:46] and some of you here you might be
[1:50:48] wondering what God is doing it looked
[1:50:51] like the pit you're in you'll never get
[1:50:53] out of it
[1:50:54] it looked like you'll never walk again
[1:50:56] Shout again Dance Again Pray Again
[1:51:00] be healed again but God's gonna run
[1:51:03] across his hands
[1:51:08] come on somebody

[1:51:13] Hallelujah
[1:51:15] and the blessing is coming your way
[1:51:19] praise God

[1:51:24] the answer to his Brethren's cry in the
[1:51:28] time of a great drought

[1:51:34] food

[2:33:05] this is the weighty stuff I'm talking of
[2:33:07] the secret Rapture of the Bride
[2:33:09] understand now just give me a few
[2:33:11] moments amen Moses in the consolation of
[2:33:16] the pillar fire on Mount Sinai
[2:33:20] that's the consolation of seven angels
[2:33:23] in a cloud revealing
[2:33:27] Sanders of Revelation
[2:33:31] and rapturing face to the bride of
[2:33:34] Christ
[2:33:35] you believe that
[2:33:37] uses that already start breaking the
[2:33:39] seals of Mount Sinai Hallelujah seven
[2:33:41] angels had already pre-facing what they
[2:33:45] will do in this last age as he was
[2:33:47] caught up in the consolation of angels
[2:33:50] of what he sought that he was designing
[2:33:54] the natural Tabernacle but God was
[2:33:57] pre-facing the future home of the
[2:34:01] Earthly bride and the Heavenly
[2:34:03] bridegroom
[2:34:06] you believe it
[2:34:09] something you look at me funny
[2:34:11] what do you think that Moses was doing
[2:34:13] there and the consolation of angels God
[2:34:16] was revealing the secret message to him
[2:34:18] the Rapture messaged to him all right I
[2:34:21] know you want to quote unveiling of God
[2:34:22] Amen and the pit of fire appearing this
[2:34:25] for me amongst us identifying the
[2:34:27] message that's right like you did among
[2:34:29] Sinai remember before the true message
[2:34:32] came forth Moses preached and led them
[2:34:35] out of Egypt but there before the real
[2:34:38] Commandments was laid down Seven Seals
[2:34:42] brought in God came down before the
[2:34:45] people and proved that Moses was sent
[2:34:48] from him that's rights and the pill fire
[2:34:51] that Moses said yet it's seen the bush
[2:34:57] and talk to him
[2:35:01] Moses was receiving the anointing of the
[2:35:04] Rapture message to bring the people over
[2:35:06] only that his face and this time will
[2:35:10] come to an end on the Joshua anoint you
[2:35:12] will come in he'll take the bride over
[2:35:14] into canaan's land
[2:35:16] you believe it's the seven Thunders
[2:35:19] reveal in the Seven Seals is the bill
[2:35:23] rapturing says
[2:35:26] are you with me
[2:35:28] listen I I ask God for my healing every
[2:35:31] day I ask God for my family every day
[2:35:33] I've got a son two daughters praise God
[2:35:36] hallelujah I'm believing I know by God's
[2:35:38] grace they'll be in the Rapture I've got
[2:35:40] six grandchildren now I ask God for
[2:35:43] their salvation and all the token over
[2:35:45] their lives every day
[2:35:49] but even more importantly
[2:35:51] I asked God to give them rapturing face
[2:35:54] listen young people love this way don't
[2:35:56] lose me now don't lose me I got a
[2:35:58] message for you rejected Stones I got

[2:36:15] spilling faith
[2:36:16] but then God's taking us up not a face
[2:36:18] down it's called ratcheting face
[2:36:21] is your life worthy of the Gospel the
[2:36:24] Third Exodus is when the same pin of
[2:36:26] fire takes the bride from the church you
[2:36:28] believe it's the same feeling of fire
[2:36:31] that was free faced in the seventh seed
[2:36:35] under that message will Rapture the
[2:36:38] church
[2:36:43] shh

[2:36:59] rejected stones
[2:37:10] the revelations in the seventh sonder
[2:37:13] which is the voice of God reveals to the
[2:37:17] bride the secrets of rapturing face
[2:37:22] seven thunders of Revelation may show
[2:37:26] the bride how to prepare for the great
[2:37:29] translation face

[2:38:09] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[2:38:11] day in order to get the bride together

[2:42:06] because you see on the back side of the
[2:42:08] book there was something else written
[2:42:10] there for I rejected people in this h
[2:42:13] are you with me now they weren't even
[2:42:16] written on the inside they were written
[2:42:17] on the outside
[2:42:19] why because it was a revelation that the

[2:42:25] seeing what Moses was doing
[2:42:28] [Music]
[2:42:31] come on Church

[2:42:35] what happened to Moses
[2:42:36] Moses was was buried I don't even know
[2:42:39] where his body is you know what because
[2:42:41] the spirits connected shh the spirit of
[2:42:44] Moses connected with the spirit I mean
[2:42:47] Elijah and this dispensation that
[2:42:49] continue on the Rapture fulfillments are
[2:42:52] the rejected Church of this age Church

[2:43:07] seven unknown Thunders that's not
[2:43:10] written in the book the back side of the
[2:43:13] book is the weightier matter Hallelujah
[2:43:16] this is what Jesus was telling the the
[2:43:19] Saints there Amen in the Gospels
[2:43:22] he said you give your tithes and your uh
[2:43:26] your fruits and your herbs
[2:43:30] but you neglect the weight of your
[2:43:32] matter
[2:43:33] Hallelujah
[2:43:35] of law mercy and Grace what law was to
[2:43:41] the Israelites is what the Seven Seals

[2:45:15] to cut out all the man-made religion I
[2:45:18] want you to remember at the time of the
[2:45:20] revealing of the open book The Seven
[2:45:21] Seals uh what happened to Sabino Kenya a
[2:45:24] sword appeared in the prophet hand

[2:45:51] and he said the saber Blaze was so long
[2:45:53] and it was like razor sharp
[2:45:57] and he said this was the king's sword
[2:45:59] this was the king's sword

[2:46:04] of people that possess their inheritance

[2:46:11] bride out of mixed multitudes that
[2:46:14] follow the message and the bride is the
