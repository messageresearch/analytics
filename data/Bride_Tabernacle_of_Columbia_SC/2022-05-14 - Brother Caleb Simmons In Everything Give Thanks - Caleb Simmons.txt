where to pray man lord jesus we thank you for allowing us to come in your house one more time lord to say thank you lord thank you for bringing us through another weekend lord thank you for keeping us lord thank you for watching over us and lord thank you for blessing us on the highways and the byways in our homes lord still protecting us from sicknesses and diseases lord jesus lord we thank you for being in our midst tonight lord come down and move and lord speak to every need lord move us out of the way lord that you may get all the glory all the honor and all the praise in jesus name we ask amen amen this time we asked you if you have your bibles to turn to the book of first thessalonians first thessalonians chapter 5 and we'll start at verse 14. when you got to say amen and it reads now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient towards all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourself and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing and everything give thanks but this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you and man at this time man maybe he had a blessing to read those words you may be seated amen and man tonight i'd like to speak on a little topic that comes from the scripture verse 18 it says in everything give thanks in everything give thanks and the lord was dealing with me recently and just thinking about different things that's happening in life and people telling me different things and in every situation just to remember to give thanks even when it's going bad even when things are going at tops of turvy to give thanks because god is always good god is his mercy endures forever his truth is everlasting amen so in everything give thanks and everything to give thanks and no matter what what life may bring you can give thanks i thought about this thing that said what was what was my trial turned into my blessing what was my sickness turned into my healing things that i thought weren't going to be against me were actually for me but it was all about what i was thinking about while i was going through it and understanding that in everything i got to give thanks because i may can't see how it's ending but i know what it's going through while i'm in it so i have control over what i'm doing while i'm in this situation while i'm going through what i'm going through so i got to remember to give thanks because god is always good he's always good even when i don't think about it he's still good to me even when i may stumble and fall god is still good to me so i can always remember lord i gotta take time to think about to give you thanks no matter what may come what may go i gotta give you thanks amen we'll turn over to the book of daniel daniel chapter six i'm sure that you may be familiar with the story but i want to read something in daniel chapter six here and we'll start at verse we start at verse 1 daniel chapter 6 and verse 1 and when you got it say amen daniel chapter 6 and verse 1 and it says it please darius to set over the kingdom 120 princes which should be over the whole kingdom and over these three presidents of whom daniel was first that the princes might give account unto them and the kings should have no should have no damage verse 3 then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because the excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm then the presidents and the princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerned in the kingdom but they could not find none occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him and it says then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god then these presidents and princes assembled themselves together to the king and thus said unto him king darius live forever all the presidents of the kingdoms the governors and the princes and the councillors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a fine decree that whomsoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for 30 days save of thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions see reading that just right there it showed that all everyone came against daniel it wasn't just one person wasn't two or three it was a whole collection that came against daniel and daniel if you read down further he said in verse 10 he said now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his window being opened in his chamber towards jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did a fourth time it said even though daniel knew today they had signed this decree that you could not pray to ask anything besides of the king he still got down three times a day prayed and gave thanks he understood it was important for him to still give thanks no matter he knew that this was going to maybe come to his detriment this was coming may harm him in his natural but i can still get down and give god thanks because if the lord be for us who can be against you so you're understanding that daniel he knew that they were coming against them but he didn't care because he said god has been too good for me and brought me too far for me not to give them the praise and not to give them thanks and if you read down further and you see that daniel was thrown into the lion's den and the king because of because of the things that you see in verse 16 let me skip down there and read this and read this and the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him in the denim of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou service continually he will deliver thee he knew daniel always knew that the lord was on his side he knew that if he served them and he and he did what god asked him to do the lord would be with him if he never waving in his faith the lord would be with him so he could always give god thanks he can always have the opportunity to say lord i thank you for what you're doing for me i thank you for how what you gonna do for me even though i might can't see it i know that you're working for me i know that you're working for my good and understanding that daniel knew that even even in the lion's den god was with him even in the situation where it seemed hopeless he couldn't see no light he said the angel came down here and shut the lion's mouth he knew he knew that it was not his power but it was god's power that kept him he knew that it was something that was extraordinary came down and visited him in that lion's den that caused those lions to not eat him and consume him they said after they brought daniel out the king said now all them people that was complaining against daniel throw them in and their families and their children and before they could even touch the bottom of that pig they were destroyed before they could touch it and god can do the same thing to every enemy that comes against you if you only believe and you got to give god thanks even though you may can't see how it's going to end daniel didn't know that was going to happen to his enemies then daniel didn't know that they were going to be utterly destroyed and he would never have to deal with him again then he only knew that lord i'm going to give you thanks no matter what i'm going through and all that's what the scripture says and all things give thanks paul and he said i was reading something that says if we pray without ceasing we shall we shall not want matter without for thanksgiving and everything it as we must in everything make our requests known to god by supplications so we must not admit thanksgiving said it says and it says and i won't tell you to turn there but i'll read it really quickly it says in ephesians chapter 6 if you're taking if you're writing it down it says in ephesians chapter 6 and verse and verse 18 it says praying always with all prayer and supplications in the spirit and watching them too with all perseverance and supplication for all saints so it's always when you're praying and i looked up the word supplications which is the root word is supplicating is to ask a big someone in a humble way to do or give something to pray to implore so sometimes you have to go and you have to be earnest in your prayer you have to be earnest and when you go you're giving thanksgiving from your heart not because lord i thank you and and then amen and and that's sometimes we get into the rehearsal then we make and it becomes automatic but sometimes you got to take it a little step slower and lower what am i thanking you for lord what am i thanking you for because there's so much to thank you for and by the time you get done lord i thank you for waking me up lord i thank you for keeping my mind lord i thank you for giving me breath to breathe thank you for health and strength thank you for keeping me from sicknesses and dangers and toils and snares and you keep on going down the line and your nose you you don't been there for 30 minutes just thanking god because he meant that good and in one moment since you woke up this morning he meant that good to you just today what about yesterday what about the day before and the day before that in the days in your future god has been that good so i can say thank you thank you in all things lord i got to give thanks because you've been that good to me i it just can't it makes me it gets it gets into you to you you want to say lord i i can't help but give you thanks i can't help but say thank you because there's nothing that i could do that i deserve this even when you think back lord you went to calvary for me you knew what i was going to do 2000 years in advance and you still went there and died for me you went down there and shed your blood for a sinner like me knew that i was gonna make mistakes knew that i was gonna fall and you still made a way of escape for me to to to see heaven to be there with you to reign in eternity he still made a way and that's enough to thank him for the rest of my life that's enough to thank him and give god praise because he did that one small thing to give me an opportunity give me an opportunity to choose him amen now whether you choose them or not that's your choice that's your choice to live for them or not that's your choice but still you got to give god thanks for just the things that he does for you none of us can wake up on our own none of us can breathe on our own none of us create the oxygen in the air to continue to breathe none of us allow the world to continue to go allow us to live and none of us control whether we can work or not but god does god gives us strength to be able to get to work god give us the capacity to think to continue to do work god is the author of everything and he can give you everything that you need so and and just continue to just thank him for the small things some some things we trying to make god we we only want to thank god for the highs but never want to be thanking them when we in the lows they said i think about it it's as daniel was a consistent prayer he kept praying no matter whether he was high or whether he was low whether someone was looking whether someone wasn't when he was in his room by himself he was praying when he was in the courtyard with people he was praying he didn't make sure that everybody heard his prayer i think of the scripture where the pharisees he was up there and giving us high praise and and everyone he said and then one lady she came to the side on the side and said lord forgive me because i'm not worthy and that's the one the lord said that's the one and one it wasn't the one giving the loudest prayer it was the one that could reach god that could reach his throne and it could could touch his heart and is in is sometimes it's not about how loud you pray it's about coming with a sincere prayer it's coming with the earnest prayer lord i want you to do something for me lord i want to thank you for what you already done because i could have been places that i that i'm not and you still kept me but lord i need some more that you that i want you to do in my life lord i want you to touch me in some more in some greater ways cause i'm not satisfied where i am i'm not satisfied just just coming to church and barely making it holding on lord i want to know that you keeping me and that you will keep me for for forever until eternity and just turning those things over to god that he may get the glory not not anything that we can do or anything that we've done that he may get the glory and lord i want to say in all these things i want to continue to give you thanks and and everything that i'm going through i want to continue to give you things whether it's good whether it's bad whether it's up or whether it's down lord i still want to give you things because regardless you just you're still good regardless of whether it's high or whether it's low you're still good so i i can't i can't help but give you the praise and give you the honor and give you the thanks and paul says and paul says here in philippians he said he says for i have learned that in whatsoever state i am there with to be content paul had learned it through trials and tribulations in life that no matter what he was going through he had to understand that god put him through it for a reason even when the shipwrecked he said i didn't know i was going to go this way but god had a reason every every trial and tribulation every fall it's just a lesson to learn how to get back up everything i like to say this thing i said you can never understand true success until you've had true failure you you don't understand what it's like to sit on the mountaintop and be thankful for god placing you there until you've been in the valley you don't understand what it means how to appreciate an a if you never made a lower grade if you never made less than an a you then you don't appreciate the a the same because this is what i always get this is what i always achieve so this is normal but when you earn something lower than that then when you get back up to that level and you get back up to that hey you you appreciative you say oh thank you jesus thank you thank you jesus i i thought i wasn't gonna make it this far but lord you brought me through and when you when you take that test and you're just like lord i need your help because i didn't understand what was going on and the lord still bring you through all you can do is say thank you jesus because he's done so much to bring you through that and you know that didn't mean that you shouldn't study the bible says study to show that self-approved you should still study but some things you got to lean on the lord and he'll bring you through so i can give him the thanks because of what he's done and how he's brought me through and understanding that and whatsoever state i am i'm in that's where i'll be content and lord i can give you the praise no matter whether it's high whether it's low whether it's going good whether it's not going as well as i thought it would be because many a times it's not about it's not about what we're going through it's what we where we thought we would be that we are disappointed we thought that we were further along than where we may be at and god sometimes you have to take us on the children of israel experience in the wilderness and make you go around because you ain't learned your lesson yet and make you go back around because you didn't have the right attitude when you came to the lesson the second time and make you go back around until you decide you know what lord i i need to get on my knees for this one because because it this ain't fixing my problem i thought i could you know do this and do that and it didn't work and then i tried this that and it didn't work so eventually i got to get to the point lord i want to give you the honor and give you the thanks for bringing me this far and still allowing me the opportunity to to continue on because some people don't get that opportunity some people they it's they only get one chance they only get one chance to get it right but sometimes if god is calling you they say respond if god call you again that's a more opportunity to respond god really love you because he comes back and gives you another opportunity he gives you another opportunity to show you that he's still good to you he's still good to you he's still watching over you he's still keeping you and he still wants you to give him the thanks and the praise and the honor and the glory and he's showing you that there's more opportunity for you to get it right there's an opportunity and a chance for you for you to grow closer to him there's an opportunity and chance that you can still give him the thanks you can still give him the praise and just understanding that some things are meant to to build character in you there was nothing that you did and didn't deserve it it was nothing that that but it was built something in you sometimes the lord job didn't deserve what he went through he didn't deserve it but god knew that no matter what he was going through he still was going to honor him he still was going to give him the thanks because god he knew that the lord gave it and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord so job understood no matter what i'm going through i can still got an opportunity to give god thanks he got the boys on the skin and lost everything and he he still well i got breath that i'm breathing i'm still alive that's enough to give god thanks because i'm still alive i could have been dead like them but god allowed me to still live on and god honored that and gave him double what he had before and everything you can give thanks because these are just opportunities for us to see how god continually to honor the praises and the glory that you give him he continues to watch over you and keep you even when you ain't when you're not even thinking about it when you lay down to go to sleep he he allows you to wake up in the morning when when when you're in your car he allows he watches over your car he watches over everything i said lord sometimes i pray when i get in my car i said i know i'd only pray for my safety i pray for my car as well i said lord watch over me and the car because sometimes you want god you're praying for your safety you didn't pray for your car he said lord watch over that as well and every time that you make it to your destination that's an opportunity to say thank you there's so many opportunities to split seconds judgments that you never saw where god was keeping you he was keeping you on the short distance from here to the stop sign god still kept you there's so many people that have massive heart attacks in the car driving and that's it and how do you stop that except for god keep you except for god watch over you so in everything i can look and say lord i can give you thanks i can give you thanks no matter what state i'm in no matter where i'm at lord i can give you thanks because you've been that good you've been that good many times i didn't think this was where i i was going to be but this is where you place me so i can still give thanks because you just using this to teach me a lesson using the sickness for my healing to teach me that you are a healer you're using the the trial to show me that you can bless me you're using these things to show me that you got something greater than what i can think or i can even imagine so i can go ahead and give you thanks for the greater because i know it's coming whether i get it here or whether i get it there it don't matter the greater is there for me and i can arrive and i can achieve it so on everything i can give thanks amen god bless you hey man you appreciate the word tonight amen [Applause] and everything give thanks amen i appreciate that word tonight of god always gives us a word in season doesn't he you know when you think about when brother caleb was ministering tonight i was thinking about something i was telling charlotte before we came to church tonight i was saying you know i was telling about a situation not long ago where somebody hugged me and they held me and they wouldn't let me go tears was coming down the eyes and i told them i said i know it's heavy right now because they're going through so much right now and i told them i said i know it's heavy and i thought about that i says because i was telling them that you know you got to give your life to god and give it to him that's that's the best options that i can give you but i told them i know it's heavy but i was thinking about that just just now tonight i says you know sometimes situations are heavy you know sometimes when you're coming up in life you don't realize the trials you're going to have to go through you don't see the road ahead of you you don't see what's what's up ahead some heaviest heavy roads heavy loads you're gonna have to carry but god builds you up for it that when you get to it remember he said i'll put no more on you then you can do what bear i preached the message one time what god allows nothing can't happen to you except for what god allow ain't that ain't that right and if god allowed it even though it's heavy sometimes you got to find a way when it's heavy to reach your hands out you got to find a way when it's heavy to say lord thank you anyhow find a way when it's heavy to press your way to church press your way through all of the heaviness don't you know that's when god looks to smile down on you all the heaviness and yet they find in a way to still lift their hands come on cause why they know that i'm gonna bring them out hallelujah we got something to thank god for tonight don't we hallelujah you know i'm stirred i thought about that scripture because when they knew god they worshiped him not didn't they and the bible said neither were they what thankful come on we find that today don't we people ain't thankful and god is so good ain't it you know was having bible study last night and we were talking about uh knowing the flood and my son aaron he sleep tonight he missed it he said he began to say dad i thought god was good i said god is good he just hates sin don't he come on god is good and he long suffering too ain't it he gives us so many opportunities don't he makes covenants with us blesses us so much god is good but the people ain't thankful they don't appreciate god come on he's unwelcome today ain't he oh hallelujah come on people don't want to talk about that do they you say how you how is he unwelcome how do you reject them when you reject the word come on preachers pour their heart out a lot of times don't they people don't want god do they neither were they thankful but i say tonight be thankful be thankful that you got the breath of life be thankful that god has brought you from a mighty long way come on you know i thought about that scripture that david said that i believe it was david he said i always thought that the wicked prosper he said until i come into what he said i come to the house of the lord and i saw the end god showed me the end come on they ain't getting away come on but god is bringing us through something right now come on he's purging us ain't he testing us and trying us right now that when we come out we'll be his pure gold and i thank god for every trial i believe it was a hundred crowd said it all the the trials and the valleys and the mountains i know i'm messing it all up but he said all those things that i've been through he says but if i never had a problem come on i wouldn't knew that god would solve him did he wouldn't i wouldn't know what faith in god would do hallelujah i don't know about you but i'm stirred does it hurt when you go through yes it hurts is it heavy yes it's heavy but we made it through it how do we make it through it because god brought us through it he brought us to it and he brought us through it that's why we can praise god today hallelujah amen did you feel all right today come on god is a good god ain't it make you make you just get joy all in your heart darn it brother kelly come on up and say something tonight i looked round he didn't have his towel usually we let the visiting ministers we pull them on up come on and get out the way how many thank god tonight amen i said giving thanks say man that was a a good word that we heard tonight and all things give thanks i thought about this week you know i was sitting there i was at work and you know sometimes just out there talking with the guys and you know you can get a little loose but i think i said something and as soon as it came out of my mouth conviction fell on me and i said lord i couldn't tell the people what i was going through because they say what that wasn't nothing but the holy ghost began to convict you you know what i did stop what i was doing i went out to the car and i began to bow my head and i began to pray i said lord i said create in me a clean heart and renew the right spirit in me i begin to quote that scripture cast me not away from thy presence so lord don't you know god could cut you off at any time i began to say lord don't take your holy spirit away from me come on but what it is i want that joy come on that i might be able to praise you you know you can't praise god when your joy ain't right come on when your spirit ain't right you can't praise god you can't come in the house and get god to get that breakthrough that you want i mean that you need when your spirit ain't right come on but when your spirit is right when you laid it all before the altar come on it don't take much hallelujah for god to come down and do something in your heart you believe that tonight amen [Applause] praise the lord saints and that's shame on me for not coming with my tie huh but the lord saw this day before the foundation of the world i tell you about caleb i was about to i i tested the first time i ever heard him share some words but you know i tell you you see what god is doing when you see what god is doing you see we know it was going to be a time it no matter who it is including myself paul says if anyone else he said include himself come and preach any other gospel let them be your cursing you see god rising up these young ministers you get behind them you pray for them you stand with them in this hour here now because when you see a young man that's coming standing before god i knew him when he was a young man i knew him when he labored with his father and his mother many days stay with him and brother earnest coming here in the daytime so you never ask the preacher to come up here when the anointing is in there like this when you see a young man standing for the gospel in an hour that we're living in in perilous times remember him in your prayers god is doing this work not man the holy ghost is taking the church over again give him thanks in all things in all things lift up the name of jesus christ speak jesus through your trials think to speak jesus through your troubles speak jesus when you have a financial situation speak jesus when you need a healing speak jesus when you need a vehicle speak jesus when you need a job in everything call him if his word abide in you and you abide in me whatever you ask you shall receive speak going speak for them pray for your song leader pray for your pastor pray for one another we've taken everything back oh caleb i tell you you touched my soul i remember the brother used to go in prayer and pray for him when there was young fellas and his father was out there on the battlefield laboring for the kingdom of god god said i will not forget the faithful in this hour here now he's moving forward saints i tell you it was just a blessing just to see him up here just to see what god is doing his time is laboring when the times he wanted the labor he knew what it takes for labor and in prayer he knew who to go to when he was going through something that was his personal testimony he knew some time when he was weary and he know he had an exam and he know he had a test but he knew lord i'd only been a lord i only got two or three hours before the test maybe i was out there lord taking care of some of your work good but lord you're the only one that can give me the eight hours of rest in two hours father you're the supernatural god because you are the same yesterday today and forever you continue to stick together saying hold on little bride don't look at the condition the condition has nothing to do with our conclusion we know the end of the book i'm brother earnest we know the end of the book then brother's been laboring labor for years and god is not going to forget you just hang on a little bride if your husband is going through something call on the name of jesus and like you said uh oh what he said caleb all we got to do is what they looked into the temple in their time but we're looking in the calvary is that right it was finished at calvary it's a finished work state your salvation is already paid for don't listen to the devil speak the word with boldness when jesus went to calvary and shed the blood he ripped the veil now you can go to the veil i can go to the veil we can in there there if you could don't look at your family memory that's struggling just claim them is that right children you got an exam coming up school's about to end call on jesus pray study look up to the hill to where your strength and your help coming from and your help coming from the lord changed care if i know why the lord gave me grace to come here tonight now i know why he gave me grace why give him thanks in all things all things are working for the good it may not be working good on your flesh but it's working for your good for those that are what be called is that right we are the cause the elect of god is that right in this hour here now hold on little bride that's why you don't ask the preacher to come in here when the anointing is here god
