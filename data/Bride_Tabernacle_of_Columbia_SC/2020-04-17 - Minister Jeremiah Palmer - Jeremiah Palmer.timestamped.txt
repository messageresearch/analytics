[23:59] Amanda's afternoon we want to turn our
[24:04] Bibles to the book of Romans the fourth
[24:19] chapter Romans 4 19
[24:32] and says and be not weak in faith he
[24:38] considered not his own body now dad when
[24:43] he was about a hundred years old neither
[24:46] yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he
[24:50] staggered not at the promise of God
[24:52] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[24:57] giving glory to God and being fully
[25:05] persuaded that what he had promised he
[25:10] was able also to perform
[25:14] let us bow heavenly father God in the
[25:19] name of Jesus Christ Lord we want to
[25:23] thank you for your word tonight Lord we
[25:26] want to thank you God for what you've
[25:28] done in what you were doing Lord now we
[25:31] pray father God that you'll just move me
[25:34] out of the way Lord and let your spirit
[25:35] have preeminence in Jesus Christ's name
[25:38] Amen and amen oh so I wouldn't turn a
[25:43] little bit to the book of Hebrews the
[25:45] liveth chapter you may be seen it and
[25:48] never the chapter of Hebrews while you
[25:59] turn to the book of Hebrews chapter
[26:07] faith in action faith in action we
[26:18] always seem Lee as Christians and
[26:23] non-christians alike we talk about faith
[26:28] and we and we sing about faith
[26:32] we even preach about faith and what God
[26:37] is able to do up your herd assistance in
[26:40] us on that God is able to do it man
[26:43] and I believe that I believe that God is
[26:48] not limited to our circumstances and in
[26:53] to our condition but Bible said what in
[26:57] place that is there anything that's too
[27:01] hard for the Lord
[27:03] you know because of man to us as you
[27:08] know humans are we are limited to what
[27:13] we are able to do physically though we
[27:18] may have good intentions are what might
[27:21] want to do but circumstances are coming
[27:25] arises and we have to alter what we
[27:30] might plan to set out to do but you know
[27:35] I'm looking at you know I've thought
[27:37] about it one time you know that but God
[27:40] goes beyond the boundaries he goes
[27:46] beyond the tough circumstances the thing
[27:52] that seems to be impossible within him
[28:00] they are possible with God Hebrews 11:1
[28:08] I'm read one and every verse six and
[28:13] said now faith is a substance is the
[28:19] excuse me is the substance of things
[28:22] hoped for the evidence of things not
[28:27] seen
[28:30] so faith isn't a evidence of something
[28:36] and it's the evidence of not things that
[28:40] we can see but is everything for seeing
[28:43] they that's not seen and I believe that
[28:49] faith has to have some kind of resting
[28:54] place where
[28:55] it cannot grab hold of something it has
[29:00] to have a place that that it can have a
[29:06] solid grip and the Bible tells us in
[29:10] Romans also you know I believe this
[29:13] Teddy said now faith cometh by hearing
[29:15] and hearing of the word so it's the word
[29:24] that are being preached in order to hear
[29:27] it all to call our faith to grab hold up
[29:32] on something and there is nothing that I
[29:37] know of
[29:38] solidly that you can really put your
[29:41] confidence in then God word the Bible
[29:46] said one place that heaven
[29:48] pass away but my word shall not so
[29:54] everything around us can fail we can
[29:59] fail all the jobs and everything we have
[30:03] is something to failure but when they
[30:06] come to God word is solid you can rest
[30:11] assured that what God said that he is
[30:15] able to do now I'm obviously also didn't
[30:22] Hebrews 11:6 and stands down but without
[30:27] faith so you must have faith is it
[30:34] without faith it is impossible to please
[30:39] him for he that cometh to God must
[30:44] believe that he is see not that he was
[30:50] our or whatever did it me do whatever it
[30:56] but our is solid the way that God you
[31:02] know is looking for the people you don't
[31:05] you too
[31:07] he said now normally there has to be
[31:15] something some kind of proof why we say
[31:21] that you don't have faith in God there
[31:27] has never been a recorded anywhere that
[31:33] God has ever failed I want to read
[31:37] something to you in the Book of Isaiah I
[31:50] was there 55 I'm trying to just take my
[31:57] time and be calm tonight in Jesus
[32:00] Christ's name because I believe that
[32:02] this is where I believe especially now
[32:07] in this our epidemic that we are facing
[32:11] and we have to deal with it and so many
[32:15] times because of a lack of confidence in
[32:20] God is why we lose the victory see
[32:27] because there ain't nothing else on this
[32:31] earth that you can really have a genuine
[32:35] confidence on but dog people have tried
[32:49] to put great confidence in churches and
[32:52] they've tried to put it in preachers and
[32:55] they tried to put it in different things
[32:58] up on the face of the earth and all of
[33:00] it is subject to fail and then the
[33:03] people lose the confidence in the church
[33:05] they lose the confidence in the preacher
[33:08] they lose the confidence in the teachers
[33:11] or whatever they may be because they
[33:14] found failure you see in us there's
[33:17] failure in us but in God
[33:20] there is no failure there is no need for
[33:23] you to fear that what God said you do
[33:27] that he's that able to do it hey man I
[33:30] was there 55 in 10 it says for as the
[33:42] rain coming down and the snow from
[33:46] heaven and return not thither but water
[33:50] to earth and make it bring forth and bud
[33:53] they may give seed to the sower and
[33:57] bread to the eater so shall my word be
[34:01] that goes forth out of my mouth it shall
[34:04] not return until me void but it shall
[34:08] accomplish that which I please and it
[34:13] shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[34:17] send it and see God is reassuring us you
[34:23] know that because he has already spoken
[34:26] the word you know that and it won't
[34:30] return to him board so it must
[34:33] accomplish what he said it would do but
[34:37] it must be grasped upon by faith the
[34:43] Bible say to just shall live by faith
[34:46] the whole fundamental walk of a
[34:50] Christian is by faith you say through
[34:55] grace but it has to be faith to believe
[34:58] that Jesus Christ died and paid the
[35:02] price for your sin and then you accept
[35:05] that by faith if you don't receive it by
[35:08] faith in a do you no good no doubt you
[35:13] may talk about it but if it's not acted
[35:16] upon if it's not received into your
[35:19] heart and then you act on it see see
[35:23] faith reacts faith takes a whole and it
[35:29] calls you to live in a different way
[35:34] amen especially now in the you realize
[35:39] that the older we get and the more we
[35:43] see how much we need God more than
[35:46] anything sometimes we put too much
[35:51] confidence in our ability we put
[35:55] confidence in our economical standard
[35:58] and our learning abilities and our great
[36:03] achievement that's alright but beyond
[36:06] all of that
[36:07] you better have confidence in your God
[36:11] because everything around us is going
[36:16] down but the Word of God amen you know
[36:22] and I'm glad you know and I just
[36:25] appreciate you know God's grace in His
[36:28] mercy that how he's giving us an
[36:32] opportunity to really you know tell the
[36:35] people trust me I've noticed
[36:39] circumstances look hopeless but I am
[36:43] able to do more you know what you can
[36:46] ask a thing but because we have human
[36:53] beings have I guess our little
[36:58] fundamental way of doing things and then
[37:03] God comes outside of your little box God
[37:09] begin to do things out of the way you
[37:12] might not expect God to move and God
[37:20] changes the whole program that we've
[37:23] been looking to because education has
[37:27] been really grasping and technology and
[37:30] and all of these things we thank God for
[37:32] them but it been making us less relied
[37:36] upon who really matters about us that
[37:42] God is a jealous God
[37:46] see the whole purpose that God created
[37:50] us that that we can rely upon him for
[37:53] everything sometimes people just say
[37:58] well our only gonna have we're gonna
[38:01] need faith when I go to church we use
[38:06] faith more than what we think
[38:10] unconsciously you go to your job by
[38:13] faith you know you are you wake up it's
[38:19] God grace but it's faith and we use it
[38:24] because most of us and I mean all of us
[38:26] has prayed for saying God bless me with
[38:29] our house God blessed me with a job God
[38:32] ain't because we needed those things and
[38:35] God bless us with it but when it come to
[38:40] difficulties when it comes to hard
[38:43] things we seem to not have that
[38:46] confident and we can have that
[38:50] confidence in carnal thing how much more
[38:53] we oughta have confidence in God through
[38:56] this because as we realize they have no
[39:04] answers for what we need thank God for
[39:08] what they are doing I really I really
[39:11] appreciate the scientists and the
[39:13] doctors and the nurses and the care
[39:15] givers in a different one putting their
[39:18] life in risk see they got to have faith
[39:24] because they have to go home they have
[39:28] to do this in their in their vironment
[39:30] of it so they have to trust God Lord
[39:35] keep me and God keep them and see if God
[39:41] can keep them through all of the
[39:43] laboring and Lord knows we need it how
[39:47] much more God is able to keep us
[39:55] listening to different things different
[40:00] reports and hearing the scientific world
[40:05] hearing them talking about their
[40:11] situations and different ones have
[40:15] different stories but the main thing
[40:18] that I've noticed that all the more
[40:19] saying there's so much uncertainty
[40:23] uncertainty on what they're dealing with
[40:28] because they have never seen anything on
[40:31] the scale even with the symptoms even
[40:35] with these signs and the different
[40:37] things that's going on they seem to be
[40:42] puzzled how we ever going to get to the
[40:46] end of it
[40:48] how and when is it ever gonna just quit
[40:53] and they have the whole world on is
[40:57] panicking some say that we are ready for
[41:02] it others say we are not ready for it
[41:04] some say they've been trying to tell
[41:06] them that something was coming nobody
[41:10] never took heed to the warning with
[41:12] beforehand it always has been that way
[41:15] you would have come to the things of God
[41:18] God always sent a warning first God
[41:23] never let anything happen except he's
[41:25] sent a warning but the people like in
[41:28] other time
[41:29] never take heed to the warning because
[41:33] it sounds so far out I'm reminded if you
[41:38] know the story of Noah you will return
[41:40] to Genesis 6 you want to turn look at
[41:42] the store in North for a few minutes
[41:45] Noah got a warning from God
[41:54] because the earth had got so heavy
[41:57] populated it got so bad it says the
[42:06] cigarette the sons of God saw the
[42:07] daughters of men that they were fair and
[42:10] they took them wives of all which they
[42:14] chose the Lord said my spirit shall not
[42:17] always strive with man for that he also
[42:22] is flesh yet his they shall be at 120
[42:25] years and there were giants in the earth
[42:28] in those days they saw also after that
[42:31] when the sons of God came into the
[42:34] daughters of men and they bare children
[42:36] to them that the same became mighty men
[42:39] which were old men renown and God saw
[42:45] the wickedness of man was so great in
[42:48] the earth that every imagination of
[42:51] thoughts of his heart was evil
[42:52] continually and it repented the Lord
[42:56] that he made man on the earth and it
[43:00] grieved him at his heart and because of
[43:03] what they were doing and how bad it got
[43:06] God was getting ready to destroy him but
[43:11] before he destroyed it he told Noah the
[43:14] Bible said Noah found grace you know
[43:18] it's good to find grace in the eyes of
[43:20] the Lord
[43:22] grace means it's a unmerited favor from
[43:26] God
[43:27] and because Noah found grace God spared
[43:31] him and told him to build up for the
[43:35] safety of his family and because nor
[43:39] move with fear can he believe God yet in
[43:47] that particular generation nor had to
[43:54] trust that what he heard Ben was God
[43:57] because they never rained before they
[44:00] never had tile that looked like rain
[44:03] before but nor understood you know the
[44:08] voice of God that he heard you see is
[44:10] something that when you heal from God it
[44:13] calls you to move it causes you to go in
[44:17] action it calls you to prepare yourself
[44:23] when everybody else seem to look at you
[44:26] maybe kind of crazy because they
[44:29] wondering where did you get this from
[44:32] and I no doubt about I said Noah
[44:35] preached a hundred and twenty years it's
[44:39] gonna rain and that generation heard the
[44:43] same gospel that North preached for 120
[44:48] years but it did not stop nor from doing
[44:52] what he heard God to say he moved by
[44:56] faith see sometimes is screamed at how
[45:01] God comes in and I went but God moves up
[45:06] on you and you got to react to what you
[45:09] hear if it's really God it'll get your
[45:13] attention I just know what this has
[45:18] something recently that I knew it was
[45:21] the Lord and God vindicated it was him
[45:24] you know but when it comes it comes very
[45:29] strange
[45:30] I want to go head back to Roman's folks
[45:36] I want to deal with a little bit of this
[45:39] about Abraham your faith
[45:44] sometimes we rely upon the faith of our
[45:47] preacher but no it has to be your faith
[45:53] see God is trying to build your faith
[45:58] that where you can believe him for even
[46:01] the impossible things you're gonna need
[46:04] to know a man God for yourself you're
[46:09] gonna have to know that he's your
[46:11] Redeemer and he's your provider that
[46:14] here is your healer and only through
[46:20] cause word that he has been trying to
[46:23] prepare us you know to have experience
[46:29] with him now and I can't just get away
[46:34] from Matthew 24:7 about the beginning of
[46:37] Sorrows it just ringing constantly you
[46:41] know because if just as or in the
[46:43] beginning lord have mercy
[46:45] and if we can't run with the footmen how
[46:48] are we going to run with the horsemen
[46:50] and we can't trust God for our families
[46:54] and we can't apply the token to our own
[46:58] lives and we can't believe God for our
[47:02] own selves it's coming down is morally
[47:07] just talking but now it's time to walk
[47:11] in it it's time to live by faith
[47:17] whatever you stand in need of God is
[47:21] able to provide it but only if you can
[47:27] believe it you have to know without a
[47:30] shadow of a doubt that if God said it
[47:34] then I believe it even sometimes when
[47:39] because we live in this outside the
[47:42] world of all these five senses but it
[47:47] wasn't given to us through context
[47:49] spiritual but it's to contact our
[47:52] earthly home smell hear taste feel yes
[47:55] but it's a super sense because you can't
[48:02] it's not by feelings see it's not this
[48:06] part but what you might hear but it's
[48:09] something that has to be in you that's
[48:13] why the whole Christian or experience is
[48:17] the inner work it's only something that
[48:22] God can do in you but so much people
[48:27] outwardly I'll think that because of how
[48:31] they feel that that's
[48:33] it but it goes beyond feeling some days
[48:37] you don't feel good but yet you've got
[48:41] the note that in spite of it God is my
[48:44] healer some days and if you live long
[48:50] enough in this life you will experience
[48:53] things don't go your way all the time
[48:57] sometimes it go beyond our own life that
[49:03] gender that Whedon made you know this
[49:06] decree on our what we call it but we
[49:13] make plans to do things in life there's
[49:17] nothing wrong with that but I believe at
[49:20] the top of your goals and your
[49:22] achievement put God first
[49:25] don't rely upon your education
[49:28] don't rely upon your brilliance in your
[49:32] status you may have in harmful or
[49:35] wherever you act but put God above those
[49:38] things and I believe you put God first
[49:41] above everything you do then God will
[49:45] work it out
[49:46] but sometimes God it erupts our plans
[49:53] saying that how God changes our course
[49:57] not only our but the whole world it's
[50:02] like I was telling my wife I said it's
[50:03] like the earth has been tilt and now
[50:06] everything is I don't care it doesn't
[50:10] change the future the education system
[50:15] all the businesses and all the medicals
[50:19] and everything now has been interrupted
[50:22] now we are scrambling trying to find out
[50:26] where do we go from here what do we do
[50:30] next how do we plan for the next
[50:33] disaster we don't have the enough
[50:38] economical resources to even take
[50:40] another one how are we gonna get back to
[50:44] normal life again
[50:46] that's what they're worried about
[50:47] getting the people back to her there'll
[50:50] never be a normal life the only normal
[50:54] life we can ever have is get in Christ
[50:59] don't even look at the church anymore
[51:01] you got to get in Christ stop looking at
[51:06] your phd's and all of these things that
[51:09] we've been holding so high on it's gone
[51:15] what we are looking for we are looking
[51:18] for something that they'll be able to
[51:21] give the people some kind of assurance
[51:26] the only source I want to give you
[51:28] tonight is Jesus Christ there is no
[51:33] other insurance are sure is that you can
[51:36] rely upon then the Lord Jesus Christ so
[51:43] much
[51:45] look at Romans a little bit more looking
[51:50] at you know I thought about the Bible
[51:53] and so many times we looked at the Bible
[51:56] just being stories that was written and
[52:01] been told but we will never see the
[52:04] reality
[52:06] these things are not just written just
[52:08] to be writing something these were
[52:11] people and they had regular lives and
[52:14] families they had think just like we are
[52:17] having even right they had disasters
[52:21] they had pesters they had plague they
[52:24] had thing that was happening in their
[52:26] generation and I look at how did they
[52:31] handle it they look to God and when they
[52:37] look to God and began to cry out for God
[52:40] then God did something I think that's
[52:45] what we need to be doing you know it
[52:48] used to be a town we said well we don't
[52:50] have time to pray we don't have time now
[52:53] we got the time numbering skills anymore
[52:59] your jobs are closed God gave you the
[53:03] time now what are you going to do at the
[53:07] time when is it really gonna get to the
[53:13] place that we recognize that when we as
[53:17] people begin to acknowledge that God
[53:19] without you we are nothing
[53:24] some say I can't even walk if God don't
[53:30] even hold my hand
[53:31] Oh too many times you know I think that
[53:36] God bends to good and so good to us that
[53:40] we take it for granted that God what
[53:44] you've been doing
[53:45] it's been going unnoticed sometimes we
[53:51] think because of ourselves is is what
[53:54] causing things to be like they are but
[53:58] no it's God's grace Abraham here was an
[54:05] old man and he he hid God had gave him a
[54:09] promise and Abraham and his wife of God
[54:16] told me that he was gonna have a child
[54:18] at an old age and I like the store
[54:23] because it said that without any hope
[54:26] yet he believed in hope in other words
[54:31] there was no physical element that ever
[54:36] Hamm couldn't rely on that God was gonna
[54:39] do that because their own body testified
[54:43] against them but because of what God
[54:47] told him gave him confidence about to
[54:52] say Abraham was persuaded I like Oh God
[54:59] can persuade us that what our promise
[55:03] I'm able to do it
[55:05] not only will I do it can I do it I've
[55:09] already done it
[55:11] I tell you to hear the things I
[55:17] understand down to older people when
[55:21] they had the rough times in the older
[55:24] days and all they could do they call it
[55:27] the whole model of engine they knew how
[55:29] to get down on their knees somewhere and
[55:32] maybe didn't know the best words but
[55:35] didn't say Lord Jesus lord help us lord
[55:39] help my children Lord and look over that
[55:43] they call along the heart they knew that
[55:48] this situation they were in nobody
[55:51] couldn't get her to get them out of it
[55:54] nobody but God and they believed that as
[56:00] God heard their prayer see when you pray
[56:06] you must know that God to hear your
[56:09] prayer Abraham it says in nineteen were
[56:15] says being not weak in faith he didn't
[56:21] even consider his own body in other
[56:25] words he had no confidence in his body
[56:28] in garland you noticed the way God did
[56:31] thing all through the Bible God waited
[56:35] till situation got hopeless when he
[56:39] dealt with Moses he made - Moses got
[56:42] eighty years old you know and how is the
[56:46] 80 year old man gonna leave somebody out
[56:49] of Egypt he can hardly lead himself but
[56:54] God said so it makes a difference when
[57:00] God is in control Z will try to control
[57:04] it but but God you know it when he's in
[57:08] control did it's no more you and I think
[57:13] that the cycle we're in it's gonna be
[57:16] not a man it's gonna be God and God
[57:20] alone when we look up bossy you looked
[57:24] the hills for was come with all of my
[57:28] help that's what we look into tonight
[57:34] looking to late at night early in the
[57:37] morning that's what we're looking to now
[57:40] God has trained a lot of course of the
[57:43] world to change God has given people
[57:49] opportunities and give them a space you
[57:54] know to really examine their own lives
[57:56] to to examine yourself to what really
[58:00] matters right now nothing in the world
[58:06] matters more now I was talking to one
[58:10] brother and he was telling me he said he
[58:12] didn't recognize how much God means to
[58:16] him until the last couple of months I
[58:20] see something has to scratch could we
[58:25] think our jobs mean more and our money
[58:29] in our whatever that we possess we think
[58:32] that's what keep but no that's not
[58:34] keeping you it's God that was keeping
[58:39] you all the time we get this amnesia
[58:44] syndrome you know and we think oh
[58:47] because of how great I became and how
[58:50] great successful that I am and I'm the
[58:53] greatest thing you can't do it without
[58:56] me see and God said no no no I'm God and
[59:01] God don't share his glory nobody people
[59:08] heard a pastor say people if they were
[59:10] returned God given the people's space
[59:17] God wants your faith to be in action not
[59:22] just the thought is time for what we
[59:25] have heard we've heard a word being
[59:27] preached now it's time to put it in
[59:31] action Lord you said
[59:37] the Bible say one place in Peter let's
[59:39] go there sucker Peter
[59:52] second Peter 3 & 9
[1:00:02] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:00:07] promise as some men count slackness but
[1:00:11] is long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[1:00:14] that any should perish but that all
[1:00:18] should come to repentance II God is not
[1:00:24] slide we get slack but God is not slack
[1:00:30] cuz sir don't it may look like God ain't
[1:00:34] doing it God is never too late
[1:00:39] somebody said he's an old-time God yes
[1:00:44] he never misses an appointment just when
[1:00:49] you think he is not there he shows up
[1:00:54] somebody said in the darkest hours
[1:00:57] that's when Jesus comes
[1:01:00] I believe his dog I believe that it's
[1:01:04] real dark right now in the dark clouds
[1:01:07] in the world just hanging over the
[1:01:09] people but thank God that you know that
[1:01:12] God sent a light in the evening time
[1:01:17] something to bring the people back to
[1:01:21] remembrance that God has never failed
[1:01:28] God has that has been around for
[1:01:32] thousands of thousands of years about us
[1:01:35] saying Hebrews that Jesus Christ is the
[1:01:38] same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:42] you know the words what he did back then
[1:01:45] he can do it now I still believe in
[1:01:49] miracles I still believe in the
[1:01:52] supernatural I still believe that God
[1:01:57] can do more for us than what we can
[1:02:00] think I asked and he's warned us just
[1:02:04] you know just trust me if I can get
[1:02:09] somebody to believe me
[1:02:12] then I can work we've been in the church
[1:02:19] we've heard sermons we have talked about
[1:02:27] it so much to the but become a proverb
[1:02:32] and when it's time for us to use what we
[1:02:35] have
[1:02:36] then we afraid to use it but now it's
[1:02:41] time for us to put it in action let's
[1:02:45] take God out of his word tonight about I
[1:02:50] said fear not little flock come on you
[1:02:54] can trust God that he has never lost the
[1:03:00] case
[1:03:01] I pray tonight Amen that you that are
[1:03:07] listening you there to that we can
[1:03:11] really just put our faith in action and
[1:03:15] that we can just trust God yes I know it

[1:03:46] God that we can put our faith in action
[1:03:48] it was never been a time we need to act
[1:03:51] upon the Word of God
[1:03:52] the time is now I was just thinking
[1:03:56] about several things that God servants
[1:03:58] said about we're living in Satan Eden I
[1:04:03] said this is Satan Eden with all the
[1:04:07] crises in all that it's happening in the
[1:04:09] world today yet this engagement that a
[1:04:14] men are ashamed before God that our
[1:04:17] leaders were plate of politics instead
[1:04:23] of coming to the rescue of the people in
[1:04:27] the needs of the nation brothers and
[1:04:31] sisters time that amen praise God to
[1:04:34] look at the condition and that's thanks
[1:04:37] God for help because God can change the
[1:04:41] situation he meant this is Satan Eden
[1:04:46] this is the world
[1:04:47] amen that Satan they meant made a better
[1:04:51] world a sin in and man is just waiting
[1:04:55] on opportunity there things could come
[1:04:57] back together that they meant we can
[1:04:59] send some more and man is more all about
[1:05:06] pleasure they meant the world is full of
[1:05:10] pleasure they said the Bible said men
[1:05:13] will be lovers of pleasure more than
[1:05:14] lovers of God so we are living in our
[1:05:18] time when men is missing out on their
[1:05:21] pleasure and then want an opportunity to
[1:05:24] amen to have pleasure again we miss so
[1:05:30] we missed the ballgames we missed us and
[1:05:32] we miss that but what we need we need
[1:05:36] God again way that I believe God is Miss
[1:05:42] we spin our sudden easy Amen or at the
[1:05:46] ball game we used to spend our Sundays
[1:05:48] and if servants on Sunday morning
[1:05:51] service on Sunday afternoon the stars in
[1:05:55] his socks was close
[1:05:57] we need to go back to God people even

[1:06:06] so far can man return can we return but
[1:06:10] to God can we get back to God get back
[1:06:13] to our knees get back to cry my god
[1:06:18] we need you now look a fallen man
[1:06:23] extreme I said this is a need he made it
[1:06:29] easy
[1:06:30] instead of transforming he's deformed
[1:06:32] the world the world is in a bad shape
[1:06:36] because or amen the saying Amen it's
[1:06:40] being glorified and magnified but we
[1:06:43] need God when God created Eden he made a
[1:06:48] well they meant in a Eden that man could
[1:06:51] wash her garden by the world it made me
[1:06:56] better to sit in man has made it
[1:07:03] possible that we can they meant we can
[1:07:06] gamble amen
