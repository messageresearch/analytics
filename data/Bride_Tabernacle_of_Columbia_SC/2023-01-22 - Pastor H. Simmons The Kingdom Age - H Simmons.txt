about the kingdom age amen there's an age coming amen that you and I are looking forward to if you're a Christian then you're looking forward to a time where amen got your rule in the Kingdom not only that but he says in Revelation 1 and 6 that he's made you and I Kings and Priests unto God so by the grace of God the kingdom age Jesus talked about I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also so there's a Time amen and you know I thought about it this morning serving the lord will pay off I don't care what the devil can offer you in this life but serving God will pay off praise God the devil can offer you a little bit of this and a little bit of that but it's not worth it amen when I talk about the kingdom age and I'm talking about the Millennium Reign the 1000 Years where amen it should be peace on the earth amen man is trying to achieve it with all the U.N and the European cancer and all the different people trying to come together for World Peace but yet there would be no peace the Bible says in Thessalonians when they said Peace and safety then sudden Destruction come in so here we are at the time where men is trying with all their uh trying and everything all that means they cannot achieve peace why because the devil amen he don't want peace amen he said God is not the author of confusion as long as you have a few confusion the devil is satisfied but God is not the odds of confusion but a peace and when one rejects the Prince of Peace then we would have no peace because the one that came to give us peace they rejected the Prince of Peace amen he's the prince of peace and everlasting father amen praise God they rejected him when he came amen he said my peace I give you not is the world give now I want to talk about the Kingdom of Egypt when we talk about Kingdom um we know that God comes to establish his kingdom and then when John the Baptist came he said I'm the voice and one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God now he came to say repent in Matthew 3 he said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand now he came now where there's a kingdom then there must be a king are you a man and now pilot declared that Jesus Christ was the king of the Jews and Jesus declared my kingdom is not of this world are you with me yet I I want you to see that amen you have something to look forward to amen you God Amen if you wait patiently amen God has prepared a place for you and I but what it is the devil would do everything to bombard your mind and mess up your life amen he would do everything to deter you and to try to get you to displease what Jesus is saying and that's what happens by Nature we were born in sin shaping and iniquity and the word of God Amen it just seemed like this old flesh this old pest house amen it don't wanna uh you know a knowledge that God Amen is amen worth worshiping amen because this old pass house wants you to aim at the feed your flesh and desires of the flesh amen praise God the devil wants to give you amen what's going to satisfy you only temporarily he gives you a pacifier you're not getting the real thing and people fall for the devil's schemes and the devil tricked and amen their succumb and the devil actually put them in the bondage and in traps and snares of the devil but by the grace of God uh Jesus came actually Amen to give us uh to the set us free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the of the kingdom of God Amen now Colossians said him in Colossians 1 here by the grace of God Colossians 1 praise God I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out praise God if it had not been for Jesus where would I be Colossians 1 and uh 12 it says giving thanks unto the Father which has made us me to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in what life amen see amen we were in darkness one time but God Amen we thank God that we're in the light now praise God the devil had Us blind he said if our gospel would be hid it's here to them that are lost whom the God of this world has what blinded the mind of them that that believe not amen the devil will blind you he would not let you see the light amen but thanks be to God are you thankful this morning but thanks be to God I'm glad Hallelujah that the Lord brought me out I'm so glad that the Lord bought me out thanks be to God which has made us me to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and the light praise God who has what delivered us from what the power of Darkness see before I get to the kingdom age because people are actually Bound by Darkness so they have nothing to look forward to that's why they do everything to do they can do to be happy right here because they don't have nothing to look forward to he said let us eat drink and be married for the more we die that's it that's it and Paul said if the dead grind not amen then I'm spending my time in vain praise God I want you to know amen that there's a resurrection praise God we got something that we're looking forward to Glory the tablet don't lock it but we believe amen that we wait patiently on the Lord praise God the bride Waits on the bridegroom are you with me because he's coming back again but here God begins to uh give you something amen a kingdom here now that the uh the natural eye cannot see but those that accept those that believe Thomas said except I can thrust my fingers into the near Prince in his hand and put my hand in his side I would not believe he said that Thomas the blessed is he did not seen but yet they believe praise God the Bible said whom we yet we don't see him and yet we believe him praise God and because you believe you see praise God why you see through the heart of faith of faith is the substance of things amen we're children of faith not but we walk by faith not by sight praise God but when we walk in by faith we see him as Moses saw him who is invisible so we look to the Unseen we see God praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus God is good amen who has delivered us from the power of God is and that's translated us into the world in the Kingdom of see we're in the Kingdom brother and sister if you don't know that then you won't act accordingly but he's delivered us when the power of Darkness but if you want to be in darkness that's up to you but God has delivered us those that believe you've been delivered from the power of Darkness all that the devil has to offer is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life but God has delivered us from the power of Darkness and he's translated us he's amen praise God we've been translated brother you've been translated sister into his kingdom that's where you are praise God hallelujah we're set together today in Heavenly places praise God now some are not setting in Heavenly places the others are set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but some are still walking in the flesh and they do mind the things of the flesh amen and they walk amen praise God that's those amen that stumble in the Darkness but if you walk in the light as he's in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ it cleanses us from all unrighteousness are you with me let me see what he says here he says translated us into the kingdom there is a kingdom now that John said the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand amen and Jesus didn't deny he said my kingdom is not of this world praise God if you're looking for uh peace and you're looking for Joy he said the Kingdom of Heaven is not with meat and drink but his righteousness peace and joy in and the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost you miserable creature here without the Holy Ghost shame man you're a miserable Christian you're trying to live something that you can't live without the Holy Ghost you're trying to walk and talk something that you can't do without the Holy Ghost amen but you need the Holy Ghost and now one that because I spoke in tongue because I shouted because I cried I had the Holy Ghost but I gave it up brothers and sisters don't let the devil fool you the Holy Ghost is not a thing the Holy Ghost is not something that you had and now you can put down and put up the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ himself in spirit form amen this God Amen God is a spirit and the Holy Ghost is the very person of Jesus Christ Living in you amen for greater is he that is

Praise Dancers let's have this let's help god let's have a whole lot of this and that but I'm talking about nothing takes the place of the word of God if the world can't do it it can't be done they may because the word of God is powerful enough praise God I'm talking about the gospel it is the power of God's salvation and shut Jesus did on the cross in Blood and died I said nothing gonna replace that praise God I don't care how much entertainment you get I don't care I will show you again I don't care who the preacher is or whatever man is I want to know I want you to know nothing takes a place of the word of God praise God you need to worry that's what's going to deliver you the Gospel of Jesus Christ what Jesus did for you if you can't accept that amen you can adjoin a church amen you can listen to amen a song a dance or whatever but only the gospel I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the power of God the Salvation you know we think about a lot of things how can you get young people saved how can you get people in the church you can do a lot of things you can feed them you can give them drink and put your clothes on you can buy houses for him amen you can have the best musician paid musicians entertain them and everything to try to get people into church but amen I want you amen they can get in the church but can they get in Christ praise God I said can you get in Christ Yeshua John the church but are you born again there's only one way into Christ amen Jesus said I'm the door by me if any man entered he can go in and out and find pastor amen you can't come no other way I'm the way the truth in the life no man can come to the father but by me praise God why he don't need no help I said he don't need no help sometimes we think God needs some help praise God hallelujah thank God for the singers thank God for the musician thank God for all of that but I'm not going to let that replace the gospel praise God I'm not going amen let that replace the word of God praise God I said look at folk he said man shall not live by bread alone but by what every word praise God the God is good I get excited because I'm telling you I I'm telling you it might be old amen but it's the truth anyhow praise God I I God don't judge anybody he's going to judge him by the book what's written in the book amen praise God if it's not written amen praise God I don't have to worry about it but if it's written in the book amen you're gonna have to measure up to the book the Bible God is good amen you know why the people believe the lie that the devil telling them why believe alive when you can believe the truth are you with me do you know God knows them that he hears he knows each and every one of his children and you know some folk I just come to the conclusion some folk just don't want God they just don't want to be saved some folk just want to be big and bad and act up and they love the devil and then even though they know than an eight foot Four Season but I'm talking about the kingdom age can I get into that just for the next few minutes the kingdom age God has a kingdom and that Kingdom is for his children let's go back to Revelation 20 and uh y'all got quiet but we got to get quiet because I don't want the devil to take that away from you you know when you sell out if you live to be 70 80 years old 1900 what about if you had an opportunity to and I gave you a hundred dollars and I said well you can have this hundred day but if you wait a little while I give you a thousand you know some folks I want what I can have with right now hunted in my hand is better than the thousand that I can't see and see they want their hundred and that's what the people want the devil now because I can't see God so I can't see him so I give me what I can see and I can put in my hand give me what I can feel what's going to make me happy right now in this life give me what I want you know the young man say father give me all the blown to me and he went out and spent all right she's living find himself in the world the pig pen isn't that right and that's what the devil would do he'll get you you give it to you now but he know where you're going to end up at in the pig pen and when you're in the pig pen you're gonna think about what you had in your father's house are you with me but it won't be to your eyes if your eye at that young man I wouldn't open he would have ate the slop out the pig pen you know the devil can take you kind of low he can put you down so low that you eat the slop out of the pig pen some folk act like they ain't got sense enough you didn't take the little hammer and hit them side the head they got sense enough to believe what God Said Lord have mercy I wish I could get some sense in the people that they can believe what God Said the devil lying to you can you tell somebody next to you the devil will tell you a lie in a minute because you ain't nothing but a liar he'll tell you he can make you happy and make you feel good but you know that feeling is a lie because it ain't gonna last what do you give you you're gonna make you want some money he gets you addicted and hook and you're gonna keep on running back I need a little bit more anything the devil give you won't satisfy when God give you to you amen that peace that Joy ain't nothing nothing the devil gives you can matches and that's why somebody said well I tried serving the lord I tried being a Christian but it didn't work for me that's because see sometimes we ain't surrendered all and we think we've surrendered all we just went through the motion we went through the motion with God and we thought we really knew God you know how many people thought they knew God and then they ended up saying well I knew the law a long long time ago oh Lord I don't know nothing that would cause me since I started as a young man to 70 years old ain't nothing that I saw that would make me want to turn from God I wouldn't trade nothing for God nothing that the devil or the world can offer me to make me exchange it for the love of God I know the love of God and Means Everything when you love God and he loves you know he loves you you would trade nothing for that love because his love ain't nobody else can treat you like that his love is so above I can't even explain the love of God and what God you know what's what what kept me is the love of God knowing that my father loved me that kept me through the years I've been camped because of the love of God because God you know the Bible said he so loved the world and he became a reality to me it's the love of God that delivered me from my sins and all the filth and rotten stuff that I've done but it was the love of God that Set Me Free from that to know that he forgave me and know that he comes in my life and makes me a new creature sometimes you walk down the street and you want to hold your head now but you can hold your head up because you know you've forgiven man might not never forgive you but you know the heavenly father has forgiven you man might forever look down on you but you know the heavenly father you just said your sins and Nicholas will I remember no more to know that God can forgive and forget about what you've done it means everything who wouldn't serve a god like this I thought I could get to the kingdom age but I I can't get there but there's a kingdom that God has given you maybe I just read the 24 first chapter it says and John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and first Samuel to pass away and there was no more sin now John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride are known for her husband I want to tell you the streets are paid with gold amen when you talk about the sapphire the Diamonds the rubies the embryos and all the precious stone in that City the devil cannot match it you try to make love Las Vegas like it try to take the islands and to try to beautify them and make them enticing Hawaii and different places but I did not seen Heir have not heard but why you let the devil ah I go lay up or not go to the mouth and I go to the beach the Beast and I go there I'll tell you so don't let the devil fool you are you with me what he's offering you just Allah the biggest lie that he can tell you all this that I give to you but it's not he not giving it to you unless you were bow down and what are you with me somebody said I never worship the devil but the only way you're getting what the devil giving you is you up hang on give you nothing for nothing you're gonna have to worship the devil to get what he got are you with me and when God gave you his Spirit you worship him because he gives you his Spirit isn't that right so the devil gives you his anointing his demons and his power to worship him and to give him honor and you can't give him no glory he ain't got no glory he wants you to respect and honor him the devil is not going to give you what he got for nothing he wants your soul are you with me and if you're alive the devil to deceive you is because you want to be deceived the prophet of God said if we are deceived and we're willfully disease is not because we don't know no better we know but we refuse the Gospel of Jesus Christ so there's no excuse Lord I didn't know no better you knew better you willfully you willfully reject the Gospel of Jesus Christ you said I don't want Jesus I don't want him he said this my blood that was shedded for you for your sins you can accept me and I'll give you I'll make you a new creature I give you eternal life I want what I what the devil is offering me right now I wish I could take and do something with the ears and if you could only hear then it'll make a difference in your life but do you know what the devil does some kind of way here it blocks I remember being a young person and you don't have to be young you can be old the devil can block you you can block you and when God is trying to talk to you the devil can block you and he can keep blocking and blocking but it's something's got to Rise Up In You and you got something got to Rise Up In You and some got to want I want change in my life I want to be a Christian it's got to be a willing mind whosoever will let him come there's got to be something that you want the devil you ain't got to want it the devil or what he'll try to force you try to make you feel so bad if you don't do it you're in Squire you lame you this you that you come on man come on the devil will make you God ain't gonna put no pressure on you ain't put no pressure on you why when you know you got it ain't no pressure Jesus know who he is and he know that the devil don't have no matter what he's offered are you with me so he could just wait try everything you want to try but at the end it ain't gonna do you no good so you might as well wake up now because at the end you're gonna find out I should have I should have listened I should have come to Jesus the father got in the shape that I'm in I should have surrendered my life before I got into condition are you I know each and every one of us I regret every day I lived in sin I regret every year I lived at the center I wish I would listen to Mama I wish I would have listened to the preacher I regretted every moment why because when I have now as

Me are you a man when I when I was hard-headed and wouldn't listen somebody was praying God bless you let us stand ain't God good the kingdom that God has provided he wants you to be a part of that

into him you are not to serve God because you don't want to go to hell Paul said he preached the cross and the cross tells us how much God loves us it's because he loved me should i serve him because of his love should I accept his love in his dying for my sins should I accept the blood of Jesus Christ that will wash me and make me clean or should I just let that blood be shattered for somebody
