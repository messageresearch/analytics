Get all the glory, get all the praise, and Lord, get all the honor. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. [music] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we're going to turn to the book of, Acts chapter 26. Anybody glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Acts chapter 26. When you got it, say amen. We're going to start reading at verse 12. And it reads, "Whereupon I was in Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priest. At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them which journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in a Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest? But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister, and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are s sanctified by faith that is in me. Whereupon, oh king of grippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision. But show first unto them of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do works meet for repentance. For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue until this day witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophet and Moses did did say should come that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first and that thou should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles. God bless. You may be seated. Tonight I'd like to speak on a little topic that I entitled, "What is your purpose?" What is your purpose? And if you read in verse 16 here, Paul said, he said, "For for for I had appeared unto thee for this purpose." See, Paul, he got to Paul had a visitation from God. Before that, Paul thought that his purpose was to chastise the Christians. He thought that his purpose was to go and persecute the church. He thought that he had a righteous purchase purpose. He thought that what he was doing was right. And many of times, many people, they get in their head their version of what is right. And when they get into their head, their version of what is right, it gives them a sense of purpose. Or they'll decide that, you know what, I have this thing that I want to achieve, so I'll go for it. That's my purpose. But what happens when your purpose is derailed? What happens when your purpose doesn't end up how you want it to be? Many people when they start on a journey and they said they look forward to this achievement and when they do something for example a athlete he might be saying you know what my goal is to be a professional. He starts off as a child he starts off and then what happens when he gets an injury that says you can no longer fulfill that purpose. Many people they fall that's it. Some people they they say is life is not worth living. But I ask you tonight, what is your purpose? What would you have? What would you do with your life? What's the purpose that you have for your life? And Paul, he had he finally understood what his purpose was. But he had to meet God first. He finally understood what he was supposed to do. But first, he had to meet God. He had to have a special visitation from God to show him, Paul, this is what you're supposed to do. And many of times many people they struggle in life. They struggle with things in life because they haven't found their purpose. They haven't found where they're supposed to be. They haven't found their position or their place in God. And so they're struggling. They they're wondering what should I do or how should I do this or how should I do that instead of trusting God and say, "Lord, you have a purpose for me and Lord, I put it in your hands and I want you to show me what you would have me to do." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, that's what that that's that's the issue. And that's the thing that we got into a time in life and a society that everyone believes that you know what, I know what I'm supposed to do for myself. I don't have to look at you. I don't worry about you cuz I got my own path and this is the way I'm going to make it. But what is your definition of making it? What is your definition of achievement? What is your definition of success? Because each one of us, if I can ask each one of us the same question, how do you define success? Each one of us would say something different. Someone might say, you know what, I just want a house and a car. That's all I want. That's their definition of success. Someone might say, hey, I want the six figure job. That's their definition of success. Someone might say, you know what, I want to drive a Maserati. That's their definition of success. But each one of us have it. what is our definition of success? And and and then we use that as you know what, this is what I'm going to use as my purpose. This is what I'm going to work for. This is what I'm going to work hard for and spend my money on because that's that's that's that's the goal that I'm trying to achieve. But what if God doesn't want you to achieve that goal? Then what? No matter how hard you work, no matter how hard you try, you may never achieve it because it wasn't God's purpose for your life. It wasn't what he wanted you to do. It wasn't what he wanted you to achieve. And Paul when he had that visitation, he understood what his purpose was. He understood what he was supposed to do. Now my maybe what he did before now seemed contrary to what God had for him, but it was God's purpose. And as long as Paul was in God's purpose for his life, he was blessed. As long as he was in God's purpose for his life, everything worked out all right. No matter how bad the storm God, his pastor was talking on Sunday, no matter how because he had such a close relationship with God, he God could speak to him and he could tell others what to do. God can speak to him and he could tell them, "Hey, do this and your life will be saved." Other people's lives were blessed because Paul was in the right purpose. Other people's lives were saved because Paul was in the purpose that God had for them and said, "What how many of us are actually in the purpose that God has for us?" Have we sat down and searched it out, got down on our knees, had that had that moment with God that we know, Lord, this is what you want me to do. &gt;&gt; This is what you have want me to achieve. Lord, this is what you are asking me to give up so that you can do the work that you want me to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; See, that was Paul's commission to do these things, to go to the Gentiles to to preach to them that they might be saved. It it only took someone like Paul to do it. So, if you if you ever wonder, well, well, well, someone else can do it. Yeah. Sometimes God will tell you to do something and and you'll think, well, someone else can do it, not me. I was riding the other day and I stopped by CVS and there was this guy that's that was on the outside. Many times you walk in the stores nowadays and someone be on the outside asking you for something. So this guy, he was he was asking. I was like, I don't have nothing. I had a few dollars on me, but I I didn't feel led at the moment. But when I left the store, he asked again. He got you on the way in and the way out. And I was like, and I was walking to the car and I was like, I do have these $3 in my pocket. And I was driving down the road and someone said, "Turn around and give the man the guy the money." So I turned around. I I I listened to it. I said, "You know what? Sometimes you can miss your blessing cuz you ain't listening." And I said, "You know what? I'm going to turn around." I done went about a block down the road, two blocks down the road, turn it all the way around and pull up on the side of the road. The guy was outside the store. I said, "Here." Now, I had $3, right? But me saying, "You know what? I don't necessarily want to give all of this." So, you know, I want to keep something in my pocket. So, I reached in. I said, "Well, two are doing good enough. You know, some other people might see them and give." I gave him two. I got to riding down the road and something said, "You did you get was that all?" And I was like, "Lord, I had to turn back around." I said, "I don't know why I had to do this." But maybe there was something in it for him and there was something in it for me. Sometime God tell you to do something and it don't make no sense to you. And you going about your business. I was on the way home. It's 9 or 10:00 at night. It's long day and I was like, you know what? Something is telling me to do this. Maybe it's for a reason. There's a purpose behind it. And and and sometimes, how many times that happened to people and they just brush it aside. Well, this was the time that I said, you know, you got to sometimes you just got to be obedient because God has a reason that he's trying to convey to you. Sometimes it's just to prove, hey, will you listen when I talk to you? Sometimes it's just to prove, will you be obedient and do what I tell you to do when I ask you to do it, no matter how small, how great it is. Some people only want to do the great things, but not the small things. &gt;&gt; Well, you can't get to the great things if you don't aren't obedient in the small things. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Because it's just like a parent and a child. At some point in time, the parent want to be able to trust their child. &gt;&gt; Some point in time, you want to be able to trust your friends. And after 3 or 4 years, you want to be able to say, "Here, I give you this." And expect them not to spend it. If they're a real friend and that's what you told them not to do, hey, hold this for me. Some people they you can't ask them to hold something for you cuz you'll never see it again. But God but but when you get someone that's real, you can trust them with that level. And that's what God wants to build in us, that trust so that you can fulfill the purpose that God has for you in your life. so that you can go about and God can say do this and you do it because it's for his purpose and for his glory. It's for it's what he wants you to accomplish because it for everything. I was reading and there was there's a time and season for everything. That's what Ecclesiastes said. And maybe it was my time to give. But at some point in time, it's going to be my time to receive. See, I don't want to block my receiving because I wasn't ready to give when God told me to give. says sometimes you just got to you just got to listen to it because God is trying to teach you a lesson &gt;&gt; and then the lesson some later on it becomes your blessing &gt;&gt; and see you had to understand that the reason and the purpose of it I didn't see it then but later on after I lived by and by I understood it &gt;&gt; because God was showing me that if you're faithful in the small things he'll be faithful in the great things &gt;&gt; said purpose means it's the reason for which something is done or created for which something ex exists and you know I was thinking about you know everything in the on the planet has a purpose when God created all the animals each one had a purpose that's why they call it if you live you look in science there's a thing called the food chain and each each animal had a purpose in the food chain it you If if you were missing if you were missing the bees, there wouldn't be crops. If you were missing if you were missing the worms, then you wouldn't see the butterflies. All these things, no matter how small, if you were missing the ants, you do you know how different the world would be if ants didn't exist? They get rid of all a lot of trash and all these dead things that you don't even see or notice, but God had them there for a purpose. That's why he said if if if he watches over the sparrow, then why wouldn't he watch over you and me? &gt;&gt; See that? Because God had a purpose in creating a sparrow just like he had a purpose in creating you. &gt;&gt; He had a purpose in allowing you to live. And I got down to thinking and I thought about some some really dark moments in my life. And I went to God one time and I was like, "Lord, you you brought me through this and you brought me through that. Why?" That's a question that if you you might not have never got there, but some sometimes just being you might get there and you say, "Lord, why am I here? For what purpose was I created? What am I supposed to be doing? Cuz why is life worth living?" Because because life sometimes will weigh you down. It'll get hard sometimes. Life will show you size size that you may not have thought that you' be able to handle and surpass. And the only thing that keeps you is God. &gt;&gt; The only thing that keeps you through those moments is the grace of God and God being there for you. &gt;&gt; That you have something to stand on. That rock and that foundation that was put in you as a child comes back and you'll have those scriptures that come back to you that you can stand on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see that that that's when you have those that faith and it becomes greater than what you're going through. See, when you have the faith in and that firm foundation that they spoke about tonight, when you on that firm foundation, it allows you, you may fall, but you won't fall to the bottom. You you you might stumble, but there'll be something that you realize, hey, something's holding me up. There's something beneath me that keeps me elevated, that keeps me from not going where other people's may have went and they are no longer here. There was a story recently in the news about this this a lot of people would call him successful and accomplished. This young man is a really horrible story. He he actually he's a NFL player, a young man 24 years old that decided that life was no more worth living. Now you might think that he has reached the prime of life. 24 years old, made it to the NFL, potential, not even a bad player, might might make multi-millions of dollars and just decided after one of his best games of his career, decided, you know, life is no longer worth living. And I thought about it and said, had he discovered what his purpose was, he might have reached his goal, but not even realized his purpose. And I and I think about that sometimes and said, "Are you going to miss your purpose because you have your goals? Are you going to miss your purpose because you have these things that you deem success, but there's something else that you're supposed to do? There's something else yearning in the inside that even though you're reaching goals, you said I it's not it's not achievement to me. It leaves a emptiness. It leaves something to be desired. It leaves you wanting something. And I and and I can tell you when you get to that place, the only one that can feel it is Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you get to that place, you got to have something greater than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to have something that'll carry you through those moments that you can stand on, have faith in, believe in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I say it when people don't have God, I wonder what they put their faith in. What keeps them in those moments? &gt;&gt; See, God put you here that you can hear the word, that you can be blessed, you can be in the right atmosphere, you can come to church, you can believe in God, you can have this and and God allowed you and say, "Are you taking advantage of the position that he placed you in? &gt;&gt; Are you fulfilling your purpose?" Cuz he placed you here for a reason. It wasn't just to show up, go to school, come home, eat food, go to sleep, wake back up, and do the same thing over and over again. You live life long enough, you'll question, why am I doing this? &gt;&gt; You got to have a reason for why you living. You got to have a reason and understand that it's greater than you. When God put breath in your body, it was to praise him. When he opened you up your mouth, it was to give him glory. When he gave you hands, it was to clap and give him honor. when he gave you feet, it was to walk and tell somebody about the goodness of the Lord [applause] &gt;&gt; because there was a purpose that you should be doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes your purpose may not be you say, "Well, I don't I don't really talk a lot." But people should see the way that you live. It be a testimony of who God is. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to talk for someone to notice that you're different. You don't have to talk for someone to notice. You know what? I I think they believe when they see you at lunchtime and you bow your head and pray over your food, they say, "That's different." There's so many people that don't do that nowadays. &gt;&gt; But that that's different. And and many of times if you get around enough people like that, they'll respect you. &gt;&gt; Well, we are. And I don't know about everywhere but but I I I've been in those situation where people will respect you just because that's how that's how you believe. It may not be but it's a testimony of who you are and what God has placed in you. The the prophet of God said he said now there are so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in this day that we now live in. People just seem to think that they have that all they have to do is keep up with somebody else with the fashions of the world and with the enticements that the world has given to them. How many people think that success looks like what somebody else has? &gt;&gt; How many people said well you know they point to this and said that's what success looks like. That's what and then they try to imitate everything that person does or try to find a way to pattern themsel like that because that's what success looks like. And there's many people that are now you got all these YouTube people and all these things. They'll coach you on how to be successful. And watch this 5 to 10 minute video and study my program. Get in line with me and pay such and such a month and get on my subscription service and and you will be successful in 6 months. But anything worth worth living for, enjoying for it takes hard work. &gt;&gt; Anything it ain't no short scheme. Many of times the true success. &gt;&gt; You is working hard is laboring is going is showing up doing repetition thing but always progressing. But with God on your side, God can make success overnight. &gt;&gt; What you deem to be success, God can just give it to you overnight just because he wants to give it to you. just because he realized you know what they were faithful in the small things. Here you go. &gt;&gt; Here you go. Because they they were doing what I asked them to do. They were fulfilling their purpose. And when you fulfill your purpose, here's what comes with it. &gt;&gt; Said there's so many, especially in the day that we now live in, they just seem to have no purpose. It seems to just be the limit of the American ambition is to get a new job. is to get a raise in your salary, to get a television or a new car. Sometimes we are prisoners of the moment of what our purpose could be. And many of times I've even felt prayed to this where you set a goal and it's up here. But somehow God blesses you and you meet that goal and then you spend six months to a year not doing anything because you never set goals past it because you you achieve this great thing that people say were a great thing and when you got there you weren't satisfied. Many people are like that in life. They become these great things and then when they get there it's like that's all. Like the young rich ruler, he had everything. Everybody would have said that's success right there. He's got money. He's got popularity. He's got fame. He lived a righteous life. That's success right there. But it was something else he wanted. He wasn't fulfilled even though he had achieved what everyone else deemed to be successful. There's many of people that have a lot of money, they're not happy. There's many people that have a lot of fame, they're not happy. There's many people that have a lot of things, but they're not happy. Because things doesn't bring happiness. Money doesn't bring happiness. The only thing said the Bible said the joy of the Lord is my strength. &gt;&gt; See that joy that he gives you, no man can take it from you. The devil can't take it. Only thing you can do is give it away, but no man can take it from you. &gt;&gt; Said this joy that I have, the world the world doesn't give and the world can't take it away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, let me say these. Those things may be all right, but there's higher ambition in human life than those things. And Christians should set their affections on higher ambitions. I think it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we're here in the first place. And ever who was kind enough to bring us here, we ought to consider and ask him what he what would have us what what would he have us to do? the purpose of us coming to fulfill what he has purposed for us that we seem to just be wanting to just to keep up with the world. He said now that's just about the attitude of people. The prophet of God told a story about this man. He came to his house and back then it was common for people to be what they call maybe I term it drifters. So they would travel around the country and they wouldn't have a home. They wouldn't have a place to stay. They just, you know, wherever their head laid at night, that's where they would lay. And the next day, they just move on and do these things. Some some people might call them hobos, if that's a better term. But this man came to his house and said, "Can you get something to eat?" And and and prophet God, he invited him in. He said, "I'm not just going to give you a sandwich. I'm going actually give him a meal." And he asked the man, he said, "Where you from?" And the man said, "I'm from nowhere." He said, "Where you going?" He said, I don't know. And he said, and the prophet of God said, and and what's your purpose? He said, I I don't know. And prophet God said, many people we get in, they get into their He said, now that's just the attitude of people. Just what I call drifters, floaters, and he said they have no ambition. They just want to go through and just let life happen and live where they live and list where they list. and you know one day I'm going to die and that's the end of it. And there's people that are like that. But he said now that's just like the attitude of people just what I call drifters floaters. And people who join the church is just about the same is often thought of floating driftwood. And driftwood it just hangs up in any kind of trash. That's just the way that floaters does in the church or anywhere. Now you take on a stream like the stream of life. the and plenty of driftwood hanging up in every trash pile. And yet the boat comes along made out of wood, too. But if you notice, the wood is made and shaped out by a master who has built the boat. Not only is it shaped out, but is guided by a master and is pushed by power. And we're all made out of the same stuff. It just depend on how your ambitions run. Are you willing to let the master craftsman make out of you that which he would he could use and that which he could control and that which he could power? He says we're all made out of the same stuff. Some people wonder why one didn't make it and the other one did. Sometimes he said it was about ambition. But sometimes one didn't make it and the other one did. Cuz one allowed the master craftsman to come and shape them, mold them, and allowed them to one day when he got done shaping and molding them, they was able to travel faster than all the wood that was standing on the side. All the ones that thought they had achieved greatness. When God got done with them shaping and mass and molding them, they reached higher levels and higher greater heights than the people that was working so hard to get there and achieve it. Because God was doing the work, not them doing the work. It was him molding and making them and taking them through test and trials that when they came out they was hardened that the water couldn't seep through. The things of life couldn't overtake them, couldn't overcome them because now they were built up. They were shaped and they was able to cut through the waves. They was able to cut through the storms and the waves of life because they were shaped and they was made and molded in such a way that they can make it through. And there was something that was guiding them. It was the master that was in the ship. And the master was in the ship. Not only that, he was putting power behind the ship to guide it right on along the way and said, "That's what it takes. Sometimes you got to let go of your ideas, your your achievements, and your things so that God can guide you. That he can lead you. And he can take your ship and allow you to cut through the waves of life, the storms of life, and he can allow you to when he when he leads you left, you go left. And when he leads you right, you go right. Because there might be a storm on the left and there might be waves on the right, but he'll keep you right down the straight and narrow. And he'll allow you to keep going through and to keep going through. And it might get skinny sometimes. The wave and the storm might come this close, but God made the boat just so that he can pass right on through it. And see, when you get the understanding that that's my purpose, this is what I'm supposed to do. It becomes an easier journey. It becomes easier to let God have his way. It becomes easier to say, "Lord, have your way." It becomes easier to say, "Lord, I surrender and I give up everything." It becomes easier to say, "Lord, do the work that you want to do in me because Lord, I'm your child and use me for your glory." Said, once you understand that it's the master that wants to do it, it's not just somebody or something. It's something greater than you. You understand what your purpose is. &gt;&gt; But it's not until you get down and say, "Lord, show me what you want me to do." And he might not show you the end of the staircase, but sometimes you need to know the next steps. Sometimes you're like, "Lord, what would you have me to do? What was the purpose? Lord, why would did you put me in this situation? Why did you put me in this conversation? Why, Lord, did you let this person cross my path? Lord, let me allow me to say something that would lead them to you. Lord, sometimes I don't have to be the harvester, but may I plant the seed. Lord, may I water the seed. May I do what you have me to do that one day if we make it over there I see them and they come up to me and say you know what it was that thing that you said that changed my life. &gt;&gt; It's not that I want glory or anything. Lord I want you to have your will and your way in my life. Lord I want you to do something in me that when I wake up in the morning it's worth living. It's worth getting up. It's worth breathing. It's worth giving you glory and honor and praise. Lord I want to do that anyway. But I want to see the fruits of the labor. Lord, I want to see that that you're doing the work in my life that it's a testimony that I can come and encourage someone else to say, you know what? I gave my life to Christ. That ain't that wasn't the end of my story. I I walk with the Lord and and and that wasn't the end of my story. Someone else saw the testimony of my life and they came to the Lord and he said, "One soul is worth 10 billion worlds." 10,000 worlds. Yeah. 10,000 worlds. But but what it what it means is that it's immeasurable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't count. If you were out there, you might get lost and have to recount. But you see, God has something that's greater and that he wants each and every one of us to do. And what he has for you to do is not what he has me to do. Cuz he didn't create me for your storms and your test and trials. He didn't create you for my storms and test and trials. But when he created us, he created us perfect. And well, he created us so that we can come to him and he can make us perfect. That we can make it to one day that we can cross over and that we can come to him and say, "Lord, some way, somehow, by the grace and mercy of God, I made it over." &gt;&gt; That that's the only reason that I made it over was your grace and mercy. But some way somehow I thank you that you blessed me that I was able to make it over and and and that I lived a life for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said I can't I can't do much but that's one thing that I can do is live the life that I have and live it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and so that Lord I want to make sure that I'm doing what you have for me to do. Each day that I wake up I want to make sure that I'm doing what you have for me to do. that that my purpose is fulfilled. There's many stories in the Bible, but I I thought about Joseph and I said everything that Joseph went through in life was for a greater purpose than himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many of times you thinking, why am I going through this? Why why do I struggle with this? Why do I face this? Maybe it's something greater than you. Maybe it's for a purpose that you don't understand or you see, but it's something that's greater than you. Because Joseph had to go through those things to save his whole entire family. &gt;&gt; Not only that, he had to he he in in in the purpose of saving his God using him to save his family, he saved all of Egypt. &gt;&gt; So, it was something greater than than than Joseph just going through these tests and trials. It was something greater. And no matter what Joseph went through, he didn't complain because he he recognized that these things are out of my control. These things are greater than me, but it's for something that God wants me to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the word tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord hands up for praise. Amen. [applause] Amen. Your purpose. Amen. As our brother Caleb was preaching tonight, you know, I was I was thinking uh was talking here at work the other day and I was saying, you know, a lot of especially when he was talking about the people um all on YouTube and all everybody's got their own fan base or whatever thing they got they pumping out, right? And uh trying to get you to look at it. I says, "But what happens with this generation today, especially with AI and all this YouTube and internet is it's causing them to to be detached from what reality really is." I says that especially with AI, it's going to come into a place to where they don't even know what reality is. So when when life as life goes on, when they get to certain situations in life, they ain't going to know how to handle them. They ain't going to know how to deal with them because it's while you watching all this mirage and all this things. Some people get rich overnight and all those things, but you got them one in a million people like we talking about with stocks and stuff. You don't once in a million, but then you have people chasing these things and chasing these things, but it detaches them from reality. Then when real situations hit, they don't know how to deal with them. And that's why you find that they they kill theel. They do all kind of stuff because now reality hit, right? Mama gone, daddy gone. Now you don't know what to do. You lived in such a dream world, right? But and I thought that that's what the danger of of what's going on today. But I'm so glad that, you know, I I look at I saw a picture. It says about success. Well, we think of success. It had a straight line going up, but it said in reality they had that line going all around in circles, all around the knots, then getting to the top. And I said that in all in some cases that's true. I says, you know, I look at my life, for example, I was speaking to a friend of mine and and he's a minister now. He's a actually a doctor of theology. And I said, you know, me and this guy came from nothing together. You should have seen us younger and that was a group of us. And to look at our lives now and to see where where each one of us is at in life, I said you never would have saw life putting you here, life bringing you there, right? But one thing about it, I am so glad that even when I wasn't seeking after God, he sought after me &gt;&gt; and he called me. And I didn't I couldn't foresee the the the road that God going to take me down. It's like Paul could have I don't think Paul ever envisioned that road going down, going to the heathens, going off. If he would have saw himself, he couldn't never see himself going. But one thing about it when you when you God's got a plan for your life. I was sharing that with the younger people the other day. I was saying you know one thing about it I says when God told Gideon he said thou mighty man of valor. I said because God knows what he put in you. &gt;&gt; You don't even yourself know what you capable of. But we search out for all things and we thinking but God know what he put in you. &gt;&gt; And the whole world don't see it in you. Mom and daddy might not can't see it in you friends because everybody can't because they just looking at you for who you are. But one thing about God, he knows what he put in you &gt;&gt; and and that's how he treats you because he can call you what you are because he knows what's in you. And I'm so ain't you glad that that tonight about that's how the Lord looked at you. Cuz I don't know about you. See, you had to be that one that that people looked at you and thought you say you ain't going to be nothing. you just going to be this, you going to be that and and then tear you all the way down and you even start believing that at some point because everything put your hand on you messed up. But one thing about it from the beginning of time you were in the mind of God. He knew you and one day he he he saw you like the prophet of God was saying and he recognized you. He called you by name and when you heard his voice you didn't most of most of the time people thought they were living their lives hot going on I'm part of them doing whatever but all of a sudden in the spirit realm God got started calling on you and you don't know why things get the shaking world around you get the shaking going down but you stop what it was God getting stopping you long enough so you can hear his voice and when you heard his voice you just begin to Listen Lord. And then what it did, you know, one thing about this journey, you didn't you realize I I I was thinking of it. I said it's a little word called grace. In this journey, you didn't you couldn't do get the mind frame achievement what it was grace. God saw you. He knew you and he beared with you. though your accuser trying to accuse you this and that whatever but God said that's my son that's my daughter I know what I put in them mother and father forsake them God took him up why because he know what he put in them and I'm glad that that outweighs all that I've done that outweighs all of what the people think about you that outweighs all of that aren't you glad of that tonight and not only that with all this mirage around us we still be able to look at reality What is reality? The unseen things, the things in the faith realm, that's what it is. You know, even your body, what you feel, that ain't reality. Because the Bible says with his stripes, you are healed. Right? He said, "I'm the Lord thy God that health thee." That's what reality is. What is reality? Hallelujah. That he'll supply all your needs according to his riches and glory. That's reality. Come on. I feel all right tonight. Y'all feel all right. It's the truth though, ain't it? Come on. God is so good to us. What is your purpose? Come on. We have a business and goals, but one thing about it, it's like brother Caleb was saying, and I can I can attest to that, and we was talking about that, you know, the other night too as well, how, you know, you have these people that they're searching, searching, searching. And sometimes they'll find something that occupies their time and they think they all right, but when that's over with, they go back into a hole. They go back into this depression and all. What are they searching for? It's a emptiness there and they don't know how to fill it. And I thank God that even in that when you was trying to fill it with other things, somehow someway the word came by and you just might have got a taste of it, but that taste was enough. And you felt then that, hey, this is feeling right here. Come on. And you just let go. You you you was able to block out all the noise around you. Come on. All the noise. all you was able to block out all of that and you kept tasting, you kept drinking, you next thing you know, you got full up and you realize this is what I've been searching for. Amen. [applause and music] Praise God. We thank God for the word tonight. Thank God. And I was just saying that [snorts] soft words and kind words turn away raft and we have to be more kind and loving one towards another. Amen. Cuz even your enemies, if you speak nice when they're raging and striing Tuesday night lessons, that those words can turn away wrath. But if we follow when somebody's coming against you and you go against them, then it's just a big mess. But if you begin to change the atmosphere by being nice, sweet, and kind, loving, God will bless. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we had an occasion to somebody [clears throat] was really had a bad attitude cuz they were in authority. And and I was going word for word standing up for my rights. And I stood there and word for word. Then all of a sudden something just came over I says, "Sir, you what you were saying to me is such you you've been so nice. You said it in such a way that I can understand exactly what you're saying. Thank you for being so nice." But I said, "Can you help me? Is there any way you can help me resolve this particular situation? Can you help me? He said, "Oh." Everything changed. Instead of going head forhead, I asked him for help. And he turned around and he start helping me. And it was just I said, "You know, the Lord was teaching me." He says, I says, you know, you don't you don't get too old to learn. Be humble. Be careful. Be watchful. The teacher at school and maybe you're one that's an employee or you work for whatever. Maybe somebody just a friend that's coming against you. Maybe a brother or sister. Just be kind. be loving and you watch God turn things around and God stands up for you and you'll find that person that you thought was against you was the person that God was using to help you and to be a blessing to you. And I tell you, find out the person was such a wonderful nice man. I said, "See, but your approach, I wouldn't have never seen that person from that angle. If I have stood my ground and talking about my rights and you can't do me like this, but the person was in position." You see what I'm saying? And I'm going get my lawyer. Oh, we were going at it. You see what I'm saying? But if you just turn things around, how can you help me? Sir, you're telling me what I need to do, and I thank you, and I certainly appreciate what you do, but can you help me with this situation? Anybody here? &gt;&gt; I'm talking to somebody. [laughter] &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; I I I think we can all use a little wisdom instead of [music] being combed even with marriages, husband, wife situation. Let's find a way to change the atmosphere and to be kind, nice, and understanding. And you'll see you'll pull more sweetness. Amen. If you want friends, you got to be what? Friendly. God bless you. Let us stand. Appreciate the word again. Let let us just bow our heads. Father, in the precious name of Jesus Christ. [music] You talk tonight about purpose. Lord, I believe that we all young and old, finding our position, our place in Christ. Lord, your servant said that the Holy Ghost will positionally place. It's the Joshua that position is placed in our inheritance in our position. The Holy Ghost is our Joshua. [music] So father in the name of Jesus Christ will we let Joshua lead us and let us not be an achen Lord God as he took that Babylonian garment. But father God let us not do things to hinder the people of God from being successful in the land that you gave us. For Father, you set us together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And Father God, we want you, oh God, to move here tonight. God, we want you, oh God, let your Holy Ghost move us into our inheritance and our purpose. Lord, what you chose us and what you saved us for. God, we know that you have a purpose, God. Let your will be done in our lives. &gt;&gt; Help us now &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. How many of you want God's will, God's purpose? Lord, I want your perfect will to be done in my life. How about asking him, God, forgive me of my sins and Lord, all my ambition and all I want to achieve, Lord. I don't want to be out of the will of God. I want to be in your will. I want to be in your purpose, Lord. Lord God, whatever it takes, Lord, help me. Lord, guide me, lead me, Lord, &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God blessed you. Amen. Amen. God can only bless Israel in her homeland. Amen. and Napalon and Zebalon is in Judah's place. It won't work. You won't be blessed until you in the place where God ordained and purpose for you to be. Amen. And how do you know you're there? When God blesses you. Because you're in that purpose. Okay. God bless you tonight. Shake somebody hand. God bless you, sister. Brother, it's good to be here tonight. [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
