[31:19] Romans 8.
[31:21] you just continue on a little bit before
[31:23] Sunday morning
[31:25] by the grace of God we know that we've
[31:27] talked about
[31:28] uh
[31:30] the book of redemption and what it means
[31:33] we talked about sealed until the day of
[31:36] redemption and then we'll talk to about
[31:38] the Redemption of the body
[31:42] on Sunday amen so we want to continue on
[31:45] in the 23rd verse Romans 8 it says
[31:50] and not only they
[31:53] but ourselves also which have the first
[31:56] fruits
[31:58] even
[31:59] we all say has grown within ourselves
[32:02] waiting for the adoption to do it the
[32:05] Redemption of our bodies
[32:07] may God bless the read those words you
[32:09] may be seated
[32:11] the Redemption of our bodies we're
[32:13] waiting on
[32:15] that to happen amen
[32:19] so one writer says
[32:21] if our Earthly house let's just look at
[32:24] Second Corinthians 5.
[32:29] and we won't
[32:31] what's in store for a Christian why is
[32:33] it what is the benefit what is what's
[32:36] God plan on why should we come to church
[32:39] and why should we serve the Lord
[32:41] and um it's all about
[32:45] what God is Promised You and I
[32:49] God has made a promise and God keeps his
[32:52] promises
[32:53] and God has made a promise to
[32:57] that we could have
[32:59] an inheritance
[33:03] and we were saying in Mullins last night
[33:05] and the Harris is that fate is not away
[33:09] an Incorruptible inheritance
[33:13] and this is what it's all about brother
[33:15] sister
[33:16] Christian
[33:18] that's something that they look at God
[33:20] has in store for them
[33:23] something that we're looking forward to
[33:26] I was telling a little bit about
[33:29] you know I was out walking and
[33:31] you know we were just praying as a walk
[33:36] and then it came on me about
[33:39] God
[33:43] through
[33:44] faith we understand
[33:47] through faith we understand
[33:50] that the worlds were framed by the word
[33:52] of God
[33:53] through faith
[33:55] we understand
[33:57] and we understand that faith is a
[34:00] revelation
[34:02] amen we can only get what we expect amen
[34:06] faith is a revelation
[34:08] and through faith we understand
[34:11] that the worlds were framed by the word
[34:13] of God
[34:15] praise God
[34:17] so the things that we see amen
[34:21] praise God God made them for nothing
[34:25] he spoke them into existence
[34:29] amen God is good amen
[34:33] so by the grace of God I'm not going to
[34:36] try to
[34:37] I was preaching last night for about 15
[34:39] minutes
[34:41] but the night I see we got very quiet
[34:46] so I'm not going to get excited by
[34:48] myself
[34:49] amen
[34:51] so brother Nathan say I'm coming I'm
[34:53] coming I said don't come
[34:56] he was so stirred he said I'm coming I'm
[35:00] gonna give me a ride I'm coming I said
[35:02] don't come
[35:03] I said he said who's going to speak I
[35:05] said the Lord's will I continue
[35:07] on on the Redemption of the body amen
[35:11] but here it says in all
[35:13] second Corinthians 5 4
[35:16] we know now everybody don't know that
[35:20] but he was talking to the Christian and
[35:22] believable he said well we know
[35:25] see it's something that he he he it must
[35:28] he must have already taught them they
[35:31] must have had some kind of Pride
[35:32] knowledge he said because we know
[35:36] amen everybody don't have that
[35:39] understanding that's why it won't come
[35:41] to church and they're lost they're just
[35:43] Center days they're doing it because
[35:44] amen they're made to come traditional
[35:47] but he said but we know
[35:51] amen it's something that we know
[35:54] praise God hallelujah I said through
[35:57] faith we understand
[35:59] praise God we can't understand without
[36:02] faith
[36:04] without faith amen it's impossible for
[36:07] you to understand
[36:09] but through faith we understand
[36:12] it's God
[36:14] through faith we understand
[36:16] so if it takes Faith to understand God's
[36:19] plan for you amen
[36:21] and then they look at he's turning
[36:24] around for we know
[36:26] and you you know we talked about job
[36:28] said I know
[36:30] when he was going through all his
[36:31] troubles and the wife tried to get him
[36:34] to curse God and all that but but he had
[36:36] something that he knew
[36:39] he said I know that what
[36:41] my redeem will live
[36:44] amen he's not dead I know he lives
[36:48] I know my redeemer lived
[36:51] praise God he had confidence see once
[36:54] you've got that amen inside and you got
[36:56] you got something amen they're causing
[36:59] you to go on Amen I don't care what's
[37:02] going on around here I don't care what
[37:05] the devil has done to you
[37:11] praise God hallelujah
[37:12] [Laughter]
[37:14] I'm fired up
[37:16] right why amen well we know
[37:20] through faith we understand
[37:23] amen praise God you're a faith
[37:26] civilization amen we walked by what
[37:29] by Fame not by
[37:32] so we know
[37:34] how do you know amen something on the
[37:36] inside
[37:37] I can't explain Faith to you
[37:40] but through faith we know
[37:43] we understand
[37:45] praise God I got to understand how can
[37:47] you explain faith
[37:50] for faith is the substance of things
[37:52] what
[37:53] and it's evidence of things
[37:56] except God gives you the grace
[37:59] Amen to see or to believe it
[38:02] they meant to open up the eyes of your
[38:04] understanding
[38:06] except God do it amen you can't see it
[38:10] you go coming to church amen you you'll
[38:14] get a cutting book and you'll begin to
[38:16] color

[38:19] to write
[38:21] you'll start to staring and you look at
[38:23] your phone and you start texting
[38:27] but when you know
[38:30] praise God I come to hear from God
[38:33] I come to hear God's word
[38:36] for we know the power of the word
[38:39] well if you don't know the power of the
[38:41] word that word of God is quick
[38:43] it's powerful
[38:45] amen through faith we know
[38:48] we understand
[38:50] amen I know my redeemer lives praise God
[38:54] it's something about when you know he
[38:56] lived
[38:57] praise God hallelujah she might be your
[38:59] next old neighbor it might be the one
[39:01] sitting next to you don't know
[39:03] but when you know
[39:05] oh Hallelujah
[39:07] it's just a fire in your soul
[39:10] it makes a whole lot when your wife said
[39:12] curse your God and die
[39:14] amen when the balls are all of his
[39:18] bodies oh Hallelujah he said don't you
[39:21] sleep I'm still gonna trust him

[39:35] and he has appointed a Time
[39:38] that at the latter day he'll
[39:41] stand
[39:43] though the skin worms eat the spirits
[39:46] yet in my flesh shall I
[39:49] see God
[39:51] Hallelujah I know amen I know amen
[39:55] that there is a body change on the way
[39:59] I know something is getting ready to hop
[40:02] on

[40:04] ready I believe we're closer now
[40:07] amen it looked like we're closer to the
[40:10] nuclear wall but we're closer to the
[40:12] body change
[40:13] when you see all these things come to
[40:15] pass then look up

[55:37] it's all about growing
[55:39] praise God hallelujah
[55:43] so here in First Corinthians 15.
[55:48] and 40. I had to skip a lot I wanted to
[55:51] read the whole thing but first
[55:58] excuse me
[56:05] he says
[56:07] they're also
[56:09] celestial bodies and
[56:12] the body's terrestrial
[56:16] but the glory of the celestra
[56:18] is one and the glory of the terrestrial
[56:21] is another
[56:23] there's one glory of the sun another
[56:26] glory of the Moon another glory of the
[56:29] Stars for one star different from
[56:32] another in glory
[56:34] so also is the what
[56:36] resurrection of the dead it is sown in
[56:39] what
[56:40] corruption it is raised then what
[56:44] and Corruption
[56:45] so this body we talk about the
[56:47] Redemption of the body
[56:51] amen and Paul says
[56:55] that we should be changed
[56:58] are you with me
[57:00] it's something about you anticipating a
[57:03] body change
[57:05] now it has to be something by faith
[57:08] either was translated isn't that right
[57:12] so it must have was something that even
[57:15] if Faith come by hearing and hearing
[57:18] come by the word of God
[57:19] then the word of God gives us
[57:23] translation power
[57:26] amen the power to be changed
[57:30] amen there's got to be something that
[57:32] we're receiving
[57:33] he said behold I show you a mystery
[57:37] amen
[57:39] it's a mystery your body changes a
[57:43] mystery
[57:45] that's what Paul says here uh I got a
[57:49] whole Corinthians
[57:51] I'm trying to get there
[57:54] maybe y'all don't turn with me and I
[57:56] just read it okay Paul was saying he
[57:59] says
[58:09] for this we say unto you by the word of
[58:12] the Lord
[58:14] we which are alive and remain unto the
[58:17] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[58:20] them that were asleep
[58:22] that's First Corinthians 4 it says uh in
[58:26] 16 for the Lord himself shall what
[58:30] descend from heaven with a shout
[58:33] are you with me
[58:35] now we understand the shout it's the
[58:37] message of the hour amen
[58:40] the voice of an archangel
[58:43] you understand the voice and what the
[58:46] voice does amen the Wake the bride amen
[58:51] so God has called us out with a shout
[58:54] you descended in a shower calling us
[58:57] together for a Rapture are you with me
[59:01] so things are happening in the spirit
[59:03] but people just going to church and just
[59:06] going to church and just singing and
[59:08] they're looking for the Rapture about
[59:09] not knowing the Rapture is taking place
[59:13] are you with me
[59:15] all the people looking for the messiah
[59:17] messiah right there by
[59:19] they were talking to the Messiah and
[59:21] couldn't even recognize him
[59:23] even Martha and Marino said I know that
[59:26] we'll see our brother again
[59:28] but they didn't know the resurrection
[59:30] was right there with him
[59:31] talking to him
[59:33] are you with me
[59:35] see what happens is
[59:38] things could be happening right among
[59:40] the people but the people can miss it
[59:42] because they didn't they they just think
[59:44] I I you know
[59:47] they just think that they think in
[59:50] another way
[59:51] they thinking that they're going to go
[59:53] to heaven they're going to be in the
[59:55] Rapture and not knowing what's going on
[59:57] with the in right around them
[1:00:02] this thing can be going on in the spirit
[1:00:04] realm that you you're not conscious of
[1:00:09] but Jesus was the Messiah and they were
[1:00:11] looking for the Messiah and they
[1:00:13] couldn't recognize them but God unveiled
[1:00:15] or revealed himself to the woman at the
[1:00:17] well
[1:00:18] he said I'm he
[1:00:21] as he ran and said come see a man
[1:00:24] and that's what he meant the
[1:00:27] resurrection and God is saying if I
[1:00:29] reveal myself to you you are running
[1:00:32] Talent
[1:00:34] you couldn't help yourself it'll set you
[1:00:36] on fire
[1:00:37] amen what's what's causing you to hold
[1:00:40] out and to hold on when the whole world
[1:00:42] is in chaos and confusion
[1:00:45] what causes you to want to live right
[1:00:47] and what causes you to wait
[1:00:50] for the Redemption of your body what
[1:00:52] causes you to wait

[1:00:57] and they're waiting but some folks are
[1:01:00] there amen I believe it's so much so
[1:01:02] amen I'm not going to let nothing turn
[1:01:05] me around

[1:10:07] to come to the word

[1:10:32] it says 44 second verse again it is is
[1:10:37] also so also the resurrection of the
[1:10:40] dead it is sown in corruption
[1:10:42] it is raised in corruption
[1:10:46] it is sown and Dishonored it is raised
[1:10:49] in glory it is sown in weakness it is
[1:10:51] raised in power
[1:10:53] I'm talking about uh the Redemption of
[1:10:56] your body it is sown in a natural body
[1:10:58] it is raised to what spiritual body this
[1:11:01] is there is a natural body
[1:11:04] and there is a what
[1:11:07] and so it is written the first man Adam
[1:11:12] was made or what
[1:11:14] living so the last man Adam was made or
[1:11:16] what quick in spirit amen how did that
[1:11:21] was not first which is what
[1:11:24] spiritual but that which is
[1:11:27] natural afterward that which is what
[1:11:31] the first man is of the word
[1:11:34] Earthly the second man is the what
[1:11:39] it is the Lord
[1:11:42] from where
[1:11:43] from heaven
[1:11:45] as is the Earthly earthy
[1:11:49] such are they also that are what
[1:11:52] earthy
[1:11:53] and as is the one
[1:11:56] Heavenly such a day also that I want
[1:12:01] I mean you know you know where you came
[1:12:03] from

[1:12:11] before the finance in the world you are
[1:12:13] part of his body
[1:12:16] are you with me
[1:12:18] the body that God had in his mind
[1:12:21] before it was manifested on the Earth
[1:12:25] before Jesus Christ came in the flesh he
[1:12:28] was already in the mind of God
[1:12:31] are you with me
[1:12:33] so everything before man ever sinned for
[1:12:37] Adam and Eve ever sinned God already had
[1:12:40] a lamb slain in the mind of God before
[1:12:42] the foundation of the world
[1:12:44] are you with me
[1:12:46] so God had a plan to save you a
[1:12:48] Salvation plan and God has something in
[1:12:52] store for you as far as a body change
[1:12:54] the Redemption of your body

[1:15:22] there's got to be something to draw you
[1:15:24] to the cross
[1:15:27] draw you to Jesus Christ
[1:15:29] other than that you want whatever all
[1:15:31] and what all the other children want you

[1:16:27] people believe
[1:16:31] it no matter how hard you pray for
[1:16:35] it takes God to touch them
[1:16:38] but you keep praying and keep believing
[1:16:42] but if God don't change them and touch
[1:16:44] them the devil's show gonna give them a
[1:16:47] spin
[1:16:48] he gonna wrap them up because they don't
[1:16:51] they you you you're not if you play the
[1:16:54] file your show won't get burned

[1:17:08] mess when you get ready
[1:17:10] the devil can take you farther than you
[1:17:13] want to go
[1:17:15] and when he gets you out there amen you
[1:17:18] there's no way you can get back
[1:17:21] are you with me
[1:17:23] it's the grace of God that you're able
[1:17:26] to recover if you amen praise God
[1:17:30] recover
[1:17:31] it's just God's grace
[1:17:34] myself I I don't know why I did that but
[1:17:37] I got to stop I'm giving too much and
[1:17:40] going too many places but
[1:17:44] I want the part that I wanted to get to
[1:17:46] I didn't get to
[1:17:48] but the Redemption of our bodies
[1:17:52] we got something to look forward to
[1:17:54] brother sister this corruptable must put
[1:17:56] on the interruption in this model she'll
[1:17:58] put on their mortality you hear that all
[1:18:00] the time when somebody dying at a
[1:18:02] funeral but it's it's reality brother
[1:18:04] sister
[1:18:05] it's something it's real
[1:18:08] it's something that we as Christians
[1:18:10] look forward to
[1:18:14] but it's not exciting
[1:18:16] until it gets really real to us
[1:18:20] don't wait to
[1:18:22] death come your way
[1:18:24] and you get excited
[1:18:26] while you can enjoy God now
[1:18:30] and all the weapons and the beatings the
[1:18:34] devil take you through all the worrying
[1:18:36] all the frustration and all life turmoil
[1:18:40] and you can see him oh yeah why didn't I
[1:18:43] just
[1:18:44] why couldn't I understand why did I just
[1:18:47] trust God
[1:18:49] I could have been happy all my life
[1:18:52] but I I I I failed to really uh receive
[1:18:57] what God had given me
[1:19:00] I waited till now and I'm dying and I'm
[1:19:03] going and now I'm looking forward to uh
[1:19:06] going to to be with Jesus but I I could
[1:19:10] have enjoyed life
[1:19:13] but now I missed out on a lot of
[1:19:15] opportunities
[1:19:22] you know
[1:19:24] I I don't know his brother Ernie
[1:19:26] somebody said person got into heaven
[1:19:29] and all they did was they got their you
[1:19:32] know it was just them
[1:19:34] but all the blessings that they could
[1:19:38] should have had and could have had they
[1:19:40] didn't have none of those
[1:19:43] you know what I'm saying the only thing
[1:19:44] they did is they make it made it in but
[1:19:48] but all the blessings that they could
[1:19:50] enjoy
[1:19:51] all the riches all the glory that God
[1:19:55] wanted to give
[1:19:56] they had to struggle through life just
[1:19:59] badly badly made it not knowing what was
[1:20:03] available to them
[1:20:05] it's just like a person so rich
[1:20:09] had so much
[1:20:12] billions and billions of dollars
[1:20:15] but never spend a penny
[1:20:19] then when did on the death bed to
[1:20:23] realize
[1:20:24] I should have used
[1:20:26] some of those resources and enjoy some
[1:20:29] of that
[1:20:31] and that's what Christians do
[1:20:34] they wait
[1:20:38] until it's too late
[1:20:40] the spiritual blessings now I'm not
[1:20:43] talking about natural blessing all the
[1:20:45] spiritual blessings that God has
[1:20:47] provided for us
[1:20:49] sometimes we wait too late to really
[1:20:51] enjoy
[1:20:52] all the spiritual benefits
[1:20:55] and the spiritual blessings
[1:20:58] because we're too busy
[1:21:01] worrying
[1:21:03] and fretting ourselves about different
[1:21:05] things
[1:21:06] and he said don't practice them
[1:21:10] he told y'all things gonna work till
[1:21:11] you're good but you still be friends
[1:21:15] still be worried
[1:21:17] instead of just enjoying
[1:21:20] enjoying what God has given you the Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost
[1:21:24] enjoying the spirit of God just enjoying
[1:21:27] just feasting and enjoying the spirit of
[1:21:29] God
[1:21:30] that's what we want God bless you let us
[1:21:33] down
[1:21:51] I tell you
[1:21:54] when it's all over
[1:21:58] somebody said if I only knew it's just
[1:22:01] like when you got saved if you only knew
[1:22:04] how good God was
[1:22:06] you wouldn't never spent one minute
[1:22:09] serving the devil
[1:22:12] you wouldn't have spent one minute of
[1:22:14] your life serving the devil
[1:22:17] but you didn't know it
[1:22:20] a lot of folks as Christians
[1:22:23] go find out that God had so many
[1:22:25] blessings for him
[1:22:26] so many blessings
[1:22:28] but they couldn't enjoy
[1:22:30] because the devil's so kind of beating
[1:22:32] them up and this and that and all kind
[1:22:34] of stuff you tell that devil get behind
[1:22:36] me I'm enjoying myself I'm on my way to
[1:22:41] heaven I'm enjoying my trip
[1:22:44] praise God
[1:22:46] you know Jesus was sleeping no matter
[1:22:48] how the wind blew and no matter how to
[1:22:51] ship you know what's beating up Jesus
[1:22:53] was sleep the disciples because he knew
[1:22:56] he couldn't go before his time
[1:22:58] isn't that right
[1:23:00] and the devil can't do you know harm he
[1:23:03] might Bluff you Bluff you with this and
[1:23:05] Bluff you with that but the Devil is a
[1:23:07] bluff
[1:23:09] he can't do nothing let God allowed
[1:23:12] isn't that right and if a god alive God
[1:23:14] got a purpose and a reason why
[1:23:17] are you whooping
[1:23:19] so you if you know the devil and Jesus
[1:23:22] will sleep and then and the disciples
[1:23:25] said woke him up said Master count not
[1:23:27] that we perish you don't leave on perish
[1:23:29] I got to go to the cross
[1:23:32] he knew him and he had to go to the
[1:23:34] cross
[1:23:35] he knew the ship couldn't change
[1:23:38] are you up there
[1:23:40] so he could so he could rest I'm going
[1:23:43] to the other side
[1:23:44] the devil's upset
[1:23:48] are you with me
[1:23:50] and when you know he said go tell that
[1:23:52] fox wow ain't yet
[1:23:54] what's up man what you gonna do to me
[1:23:56] tell that fox
[1:23:58] y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:24:01] praise God if God allows something it's
[1:24:03] gonna work till you're good
[1:24:06] that's why you allowed it for your good
[1:24:09] Ness not oh look what the devil's doing
[1:24:11] to me in the deviling
[1:24:13] the devil is he went to you good
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:20] the cursing was a blessing
[1:24:24] they'll try to curse God people but he
[1:24:26] blessed them
[1:24:28] amen I'm telling you it's for you're
[1:24:30] good

[1:28:36] Forgive Me O God from my my doubting and
[1:28:40] oh God forgive me Lord God
[1:28:43] and I want to look to you now
[1:28:46] because I know you got all things in
[1:28:49] control
[1:28:50] Hallelujah bless your children now Lord
[1:28:55] strengthen us Lord
[1:28:57] help us to look beyond the curtains of
[1:28:59] time
[1:29:00] see our new house
[1:29:03] our new home
[1:29:06] whether I saw a new Heaven and I knew
[1:29:08] her
[1:29:09] If any man be in Christ he's a new
[1:29:11] creature
[1:29:13] all things passed away all things will
[1:29:16] come to you

[1:29:36] you know you won't have to
[1:29:38] look around
[1:29:43] but expect
[1:29:44] little things the little things thank
[1:29:46] God for the little things
[1:29:49] because
[1:29:50] it might be the beginning of greater
[1:29:52] things
[1:29:54] and I'm saying if we don't thank God for
[1:29:57] the little things we'll never be able to
[1:29:58] recognize the bigger things
