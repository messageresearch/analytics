over the land oh god there's so many that need you oh god there's so many that need to touch so many that need a move of god in their lives oh god and we lord jesus doing oh god what we know what to

holy ghost lord that you might bless us you might give us leadership oh god in direction keep our minds lord sound oh lord jesus that we won't drift with the current of the wind oh jesus have mercy i pray bless us now thank you for all your many blessings in jesus christ's name amen amen we want to look at the book of hebrews by god's grace hebrews 3. it was something i've been ministering on hebrews 3 and we'll begin at the at the 7 first hebrews 3 and 7 and it reads wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden out your hearts as in the provocation in a day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me prove me and saw my works 40 years wherefore was i grieve with that generation and said they do air always err in their way in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath that i mean they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you harden through deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of the con confidence steadfast of our confidence steadfast until the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice harden out your heart as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom he was grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see then so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief may god have blessed to the reading of his word tonight by god's grace just for a moment i want to speak to you on a topic and i entitled it what grieves god amen what grieves god or will say what makes god angry you know we're just looking here and we when we're looking at that word grieve we says that you know what hurts god or what wounds him what brings him pain you know what saddens him or what or what upsets him you know or in one particular way they say what breaks his heart come on i says what grieves god what saddens him what what makes him angry what what breaks his heart so we're talking about tonight what grieves god so we know here i says here in the scriptures is just a little something that you know the lord had put on our hearts and i've been ministering on it now for the last couple weeks but it's just is is what grieves god what you know we always say that faith is the key come on that that unlocks every door all god wants is you know somebody to believe him all that he does all that he does in the prelude of the the the miracles the signs and the wonders you know what he says that 80 i think they said 80 of jesus ministry was healing so what he was doing he was just trying to to do something in the people's midst just to just to get their faith to arise just so they can believe him that's what god god wants god wants you know someone to believe him you know i says that here in the scriptures how how it wraps up you know just talking about the children of israel it says that you see it says we see that many of them they couldn't enter in because of their unbelief so we know that you know when we're talking about sin you say what is sin sin isn't isn't necessarily drinking smoking committing adultery and all those things those are the attributes of sin but what sin is the real sin is the unbelief you do those things because you don't believe uh god is who he say he is or you do those things because you don't believe that they that do those things what god said is going to happen to do they do those things that's why they can live those lives that's why you know people can uh play church that's why people can make all kind of jokes about god and and have no respect for him it's not that you know that that is just a sin but they don't believe that he is god and he's gonna he's gonna repay one day so they do those things but god you know he goes to extra distance a lot of times just to get us he does we would call him extraordinary but he does supernatural things just to get us to believe and that's what we wrestle with a lot of times i like how in the scriptures he says he says uh will he find faith you know when he returns because he talks about uh the unjust judge and he talks about how you know the unjust judge he didn't fear god nor man but it was a woman who needed something done he she needed some avenging so she kept coming to him and he says that let let me so this lady won't won't wear me he said let me just go ahead and and uh give her a request cause because her i believe her faithfulness her diligence before she wearing me but he it goes on to say in the scriptures that men ought to pray always without fainting he says so if the unjust judge would do those things he says how much more than that you know our god or or what he do for the elect you know it's not i i want to encourage everybody that it's not don't get weary and well doing you know the bible says that you know they that wait upon the lord they'll renew their strength you know they'll mount up wings as eagles come on you waiting you're waiting on the lord you might get tired you might get a little weary sometimes in this journey because you're pressing your way you you got patience and you wear it but it says they that wait on the lord they'll renew their strength come on in that time when you feel as though you weary and you might faint watch what god does he'll come down sometimes when you think you ain't got enough to go that extra mile god just you just send something fresh a fresh anointing a fresh something on your life and what it does it gives you faith to say hey i feel like traveling on i feel like going a little bit further last night it was a battle it was a fight i might have felt like giving up but i got a little bit more fight in me i got a little bit more patience i got a little bit more i'mma wait just a little bit longer lord on the lord what it was it wasn't you but it was god did something in the spirit that gave you a little bit more to go on and i thank god for that and sometimes we need that sometimes we need to get down on our knees and pray and say god i need a little bit more lord come on i remember when uh when the church uh world in the book of acts when they were getting pressure and persecuted on on every end i believe that the bible says they got together and they began to pray even though they know persecution was hidden and they were hiding sometimes going but they said lord give us boldness god god we need something from you god to help us because we know that it's the mountains that we're gonna have to climb we know it's an uphill fight but god give us boldness lord to stand so they had to pray to god for for a little extra and that's what it is i says as an individual from the ministry on down we can't be we can't be um ashamed to say god i need more lord i need i need more god lord what i got oh i believe david said uh my cup runneth over he didn't just be satisfied with just a little bit of feeling of the cup god let my cup run over god let it spill i need more and that's the way i've been praying here lately i said god i need more lord i need your help god i need you to increase my boundaries god i need your blessings god i need spiritual wisdom lord i need guidance i've been trying it on my own god and you know trying it on my own it just don't work out all the time i said god i need you your step your help every step of the way you know this world is so wicked we come into times where it's so evil come on that the bible says that if it were possible it'll deceive the very elect you know it says that you know he was going to deceive all in the end the the the rich the the poor the bond the free all these people says god if it is that way how much more do we need to not just or just walk with god but we need to be like god we need god to to be in us engulf us god what i that's what we say is it's always the importance of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost and that's what we want to talk about tonight not it's not good enough just to come out but you got to go in come on and he says they didn't go in because of unbelief and that's what we're battling with tonight they were going into a natural land but you and i god has brought us out of sin and shame brought us out of out of the uh of denominational creeds and dogmas the way we can see that it's not it's not man made theology and all these things but we've been brought to the word we see god for who he is and now he's saying i want you to do what don't don't be like them don't perish but i've done so many great things for you believe me don't have an evil heart of unbelief but i want you to go in come on he said they died you know a lot of times we see casualties no no i'm getting ahead of myself but we see casualties god did so many great works so many great things in people's lives brought them delivered them from alcohol delivered them from prostitution crack cocaine delivered them from many things maybe heal their bodies brought them off of a death bed so many uh powerful testimonies but yet god has done those things but don't stop there because god you can have a powerful testimony and still not gideon come on still die in the wilderness you think about those that were walking around in the wilderness those 40 years they could talk and they could tell some of the younger group of that was with them oh how we were in bondage and god sent the man one day with thus saith the lord god began to do it took what we call supernatural intervention he would come down and he done some mighty things i was there when the red sea open i was there when they gave us water in the desert i was there come on when all these great battles and all these come on many of them were there but what happened they didn't get in they died in the wilderness come on but you had two that that they didn't have what they call a sin of unbelief they didn't wouldn't uh um they said we know god has brought us from a mighty long way and yes god has won some battles for us but we ain't gonna stop right here come on we still got a race to run we still got ground we got to obtain the battle ain't over yet we still got to go in come on let's go in and that's what he says i always i says what it is you know god i don't want uh uh uh your your testimony uh your or or the be in vain come on and that's what the devil want to do he want to destroy your testimony he wants you to perish with all those great things god has done for you come on your testimony to be in vain i said don't let your testimony be in vain but be victorious come on being over like he says they they have overcome come on i know he said you overcome the world because i've overcome the world don't just uh you know you can have a lot of good victories but did you win the war come on when it was said and done did you come out with when you come out standing strong did you come out victorious you might have won the battle here and won the battle there but when the whole picture was done come on hey did you come out victorious was the end of the story you won and that's what it is we fight battles and we might lose some battles but at the end of the day i want to win the war how many want to win the war tonight and that's what we're finding that says you know you know he says that that many you know we find that they didn't enter in uh because of their unbelief and you know i says that you know from those things smoking drinking all those things they aren't they aren't uh that isn't what what we're seeing is that's just the attributes of it you do those things you know because you just don't believe who he is and i says what it is you're not separated from god because of those things you do but you're separated from god because you you you chose not to walk in his provided way come on god made a way of escape for you but you chose not to walk in that way so you inherited all those attributes of sin that's why you do those things because you don't believe come on many people say i believe well you know you do those things because you don't believe if you genuinely believed you know a god and what he said then you wouldn't you wouldn't do those in your heart you might slip but you'll quickly be reconciled with god because you you believe god and you what you want to do in your heart he says they had in them it says in them was an evil heart come on of unbelief and that's what it is god that's the part that god is judging god is judging our heart now god knows that we're just men and and and we like to say that and sometimes we get caught up in the situations and all that but what's ever in your heart come on that's what's going to come out we look at a tree you know i've heard it saying that the fruits on the tree ain't what ain't what makes the tree good or bad it only identifies uh uh what the tree is come on the fruits of the apples or whatever it just identifies what type of tree it is the oranges just identifies what type of tree it is and that's why it says uh uh you'll you'll know uh uh you'll know the tree come on by the fruit that it bears so a lot of times you can speak from your heart but we ain't just i mean you can speak from your mouth but we ain't looking at a lot of times will come out of your mouth because what comes out of the man's mouth sometimes might deceive him but you let the word try it come on the word is sharper than any two-edged sword it can divide those things it can look beyond the scenes or what the preacher can't look beyond it can look beyond the scenes of what the world can't see and it when it looks beyond the scene it sees the real you and that's what uh god wants to deal with that's what all the the crying out the preaching is about to to to shake you up because it wants to deal with the real you come on the outward a man might deceive a person day by day but what's in that heart come on that's what we want to deal with i said god i might not have it all right many times on the outside but when you look in my heart god let my heart be right let my heart be in a way i believe in david and all all of his wickedness that you can look at and the things he done god can say he's a man after my own heart come on i know that in his heart come on he's it's something in his heart i ca i can look over that when y'all want to stone him and kill him and dethrone him i can say i forgive him be oh i can say i'm gonna bear with him because i know what's in his heart come on and that's what it is i say god that's when you look in my heart god in my heart let me you know i like that song and say that's in my heart to serve the lord lord let it be in my heart god i'm not so much necessarily looking at the outside because if the heart is right the outside gonna get right come on because that's what it says when you look at when you look at the fruit of the tree it's going to identify what type of tree it is and i thank god for that so that's what we we we contend with i said is that you know the the your unbelief that's what it does you're not separated from god because you're a sinner but and that's what happens when you choose not to walk in this provided way come on you destroy yourself a lot of times you know i was thinking about noah in the days of noah you know yes they were evil and and the thoughts and imagination of men's heart was on evil continually come on i believe we're living in such a day as that now all the way you look around men's heart on evil continually but yet they're religious and they still want to confess god they want to have a form of godliness come on but they're still denying the power i believe that god still has power and his power he can still keep you come on i don't care how wicked the world is and how many pools that the world got on you but once the holy ghost has come in and to you it's an anchor come on that's what it is it's an anchor that when the world began to pour on you the winds begin to try to toss you that anchor gonna hold you come on it's gonna keep you solid why because there's power in that anchor that anchor ain't just hooked in the sand but that anchor is hooked on a rock hallelujah come on when you want to get loose i thank the lord that he still got you anchored and he reminds you come on it's only for a little while endure i want you to fight he didn't like he says he i give you the land but you're going to have to fight for it every place that you touch i'm giving it to you hallelujah i look at it like way i said lord what it is this mind let's don't talk negative we speaking positive it's mine why because the lord gave me a promise this is where my foot stepped on and god has given it to me now i'm gonna fight for it but god is fighting all of my battles but i believe that well we find that like it says what it is uh to encourage your faith we look at like i was saying i was meditating on on the days of noah how the imagination of men's heart come on it was on evil continually but that ain't what that ain't what destroyed them what destroyed them was when god made a way of escape for them come on god had to provide a way of escape then the ark come on and even though they were sin and wicked i believe if they would have got in the ark they would have been saved come on but they chose not to get in the ark they chose to die in their sins and that's what jesus says once he says that if you don't believe that i'm he come on he says you'll die in your sins come on you got to believe that i'm here and i'm and i'm telling you something that's going to help you save your soul i'm telling you something that's gonna keep you out of the out of the tribulation that's gonna keep you from separating yourself from god it might hurt your flesh you might not want to do it but what i'm telling you it's gonna save you come on and that's what it is you know the word that's why it says preach it in season out of season oh it hurts sometimes we have to battle sometimes but it's for the saving of your soul god won't do nothing to hurt you but he does those things because he loves you and he don't want you to perish with the world he's made a way of escape that's what he came and all is coming and dying for you imagine to the extent god went to save us he didn't send nobody but he came himself he bled and he died he he let him whip him he let him spit on him and and went that distance why because he loved you and i and for him to make a way of escape and yet people every day they choose that they don't want to walk in that way of escape but they rather die in their sins come on but god has a chosen group that that that love and they and they and they thank god they're thankful for what he done for him god if you can go that distance from me lord i can go the distance from you come on the world is picking at you for wanting to be holy the world is picking at you for wanting to stand up and be honest and live right for god the world is picking at you because you ain't indulging in sin but what is that i said lord let the world mock but god i want to be one of those despised few they rejected you god what about and i know that they reject me as well but god i'm willing to bear that reproach why because of my love for you god you could have left me in my sin you could have had me uh dying without a without a a a a a a way oh god to be reconciled back to you but even when i was dead and trespassing sin god you buried with me god thank you and that's what we thank the lord for come on so we find that and that's what should have been enough you know even with the children of israel that we find in here that should have been enough when they god when we look back lord and see where you brought us from and we see god what you've done for us oh god then we're going to stay with you lord come on we could have stayed in egypt and just died there but god if i die here in the battlefield lord let me die but i know i won't die come home why because you promised that you'll give me the land come on so what it is we we just saying that going through the motion but god when we look back if israel can only and that's what uh joshua and caleb you know the bible says you know after the ten spies come back and they had the people all shook up come on in their minds it's giants in the land the bible says that joshua and caleb steal the people come on and they said come on yeah it might be giants in the land it says but our god is able come on he's able can't you see i believe they wanted to remind the people come on what god has done for you look back ain't that enough shouldn't that have sealed your testimony god done those things because out of all that you asked god for he did things time at the time again just to get you to believe him and now here we are we're to the place to where we at the land it's time to go in you're going to let the devil stop you from going in come on you're going to let the devil get you to stop believing god now after all that god has done for you come on brother and sister let's stop like me and let's quit looking at the situation in the battle before us and let's just press on knowing that if god didn't want god to do it again he never failed his promises are yeah and nothing god never gave us a promise that he didn't come through on and if whatever it takes god i'ma wait on him come on stand there that's what he says you know i says what grieves god come on what hurts them what makes them angry the bible says that for 40 years what he says was i grieve with that generation because why they didn't believe me that's all that i've done for them they they it didn't that god didn't give them the land they chose not to go in and that's what it is many people they say that you know when when you come in and you repent of your sins and you've been baptized come on in the name of the lord jesus christ and for the mission of your sins the bible says come on it's not that what the man told you or what the preacher told you but the bible says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost come on you ain't got to work for it it's a gift that god has given you if you don't go in come on it's because you chose not to go in you believe even for the saving uh or the salvation for your salvation to be sanctified come on go on in to the promise what it is god has promised you the holy ghost i said the holy ghost is yours all you got to do is receive it don't let the devil you scarecrows you to the land it's giants and all those things come on it was a supernatural happening that brought you out of sin and it's going to be a supernatural happening to bring you into the land into the promise of the holy ghost god i'm looking for the supernatural god i'm looking for you to do something real again in my life that's what it is we pressing on to it devil i might be here today i'll fall down today and fall down tomorrow but i'm still pressing i'm still getting up i'm still fighting the holy ghost is mine why because god promised it to me and i ain't gonna perish god has brought too much for me for me to die in the wilderness god has brought me too far to come and just be a former church member i can't do that come on you say i got to go on then i got to be that super racist i got to be that one that lay hands on the sick and they shall recover not because of me but it's the power that god has invested in you by the holy ghost come on you got to be the one do the greater works come on an evil heart he said of unbelief makes god angry because time and time again people don't believe them all that i've done for them and yet they don't believe me the bible said he swore by his wrath come on he was angry he said i swore about my wrath they ain't gonna enter in come on i did all what what else can i do you know the bible says that uh or without faith it's impossible to please god come on it's impossible to please him without faith he says before you even come to god you got to first uh believe that he is god come on and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him come on he put that in there because sometimes like we were saying and he says man ought to pray always come on you know pray day and night come on god god ain't some people think their prayers going on there so come on but god ain't forgot your prayers god he heard you i like how he told i think it was daniel or one he said i heard you the first day that you prayed come on he said ever since the first time you prayed i heard you but what it was the devil you know we know he was trying to hinder the blessed god he says but i heard you the first day you prayed come on and that's encouraging to me we keep praying and we keep crying but god he heard you the first time come on and what it is we didn't stop we kept pressing we kept pressing not only did we press but we confess come on that the work is already done you know the bible says that these things were done before the foundation of the world come on only thing we doing is just acting out and moving in the path that god has allotted for us and i thank god for that come on i says god just help me to be faithful i know they they sing a song sometimes i promise the lord come on that i hold out come on hold out until he comes come on come on is that just a song are we holding out is that just a song or are we waiting are we willing to have patience come on i believe the bible says let patience have it have his perfect work come on that it might perfect us and that's what we're doing what are we doing right now waiting on the lord come on what are we doing right now waiting on this leadership waiting on his direction or where we going to go come on god has all the answers how many believe that but we says what grieves god i say is that you know let's look at hebrews 4 by god's grace what grieves god you know what what makes them like we said what makes them angry come on i said god i don't want to make you angry god i don't want to upset you lord i don't want to like they say break your heart come on i don't want to break your heart lord come on but god i just want to believe you and and whatever you path you got set before you before me lord help me to believe you whatever situation you know might come my way lord help me just to stand firm hold out come on until you come i like how in the scriptures even jesus looked at the disciples and at that time i think it was 70 walking with him and he said set the man eat my flesh and drink my blood come on and then he won't have an apartment he was saying no says man that's a hard saying they walked away and they went back and then jesus look at the rest and say hey are you going to walk away as well one point he called one of them the devil says i chose 12 of you but one of you a devil come on he said you're going to walk away but peter i believe it says lord he says uh we know that what you're saying i don't even understand it i like i said i don't even understand what you're saying i'm not gonna say oh i know what you're saying he said lord i don't even understand what you're saying right now he said but i know god that in in the buy-and-buy you'll reveal what you're saying he says plus he says where we gonna go come on we don't for sukkah where we gonna go i'm convinced that that you got the the keys come on we're just paraphrasing it to your eternal life you got what i'm what i need you got something that i'm longing for so i don't understand it right now but i'm willing to wait on it i'm willing to follow you to the end god come on and that's what it is a lot of times you know uh things happen that cause you to turn around but i believe as peter said we don't forsook all lord where we gonna go come on you know the man that happened forsook and all he's got planned to turn around at any time he's got something in reserve held back so when the battle gets hot he's got a backup plan come on but with guards you don't need a backup plan with the lord he is the backup plan as we say come on i believe when he asks you to come when he calls the man he says drop what you're doing you don't need to come on just follow me i already got the way made and what it is he's asking you to step out on faith he didn't even show abraham but he said get you out of your country come on from around your family come on get you out there you say well you know how many bandits and thieves out there you know how many nations out there that might consume us no he said get you out of there and then abraham i don't believe was concerned about those things but by faith he stepped out come on not knowing where he was going but it says that he he professed that he was a pilgrimage he was in search for something for a city whose builder and maker was god come on he wasn't concerned about the other nations around him that could have potentially swallowed him up but by faith he stepped out he made that he made that movement by faith to step out and just believe god come on without a backup plan like he says he says he told jesus told peter knows he said no man has forsaken all come on you might think you gave up something but god jesus gave up way more than what we gave up he said but since you did give it up i'm gonna give you not only a hundredfold in this life but in the life to come i'm gonna give you everlasting life come on i encourage you tonight give up everything forsake all you don't need like we said they say a backup plan god is your backup plan recycle reserve you know because god is he he's going to make the way god is already there we're stepping out what it is we're stepping out we're moving out in faith i believe that how many want to move out in faith today come on which says we're not not to be in a radical way but as paul says once he says in the way that i worship god they call it heresy in the way that i worship god he says all these things i believe paul had a lot of things at his disposal but he says that when i i counted it all what loss so i might gain christ come on he had a revelation that you had to forsake all he had a revelation come on the the give it all up i believe the bible says that that that uh uh moses he forsook uh uh to be the son of pharaoh's daughter he forsook the throne come on all these things to be what to go out there and be amongst god's children to be because he saw uh something greater in him he saw something greater in the afflictions and the suffering he saw he had a vision that the other ones couldn't see and that's what it is god has to change our vision that way we ain't looking on these natural eyes but we're looking through the eyes of faith we're looking into the spirit realm we can see what the other church members can't see we can see what the other people ain't seeing that's why we can go to this and you can try to convince them but if they ain't seeing what you see and they won't be able to go the only thing you can do is pray and say god open their eyes that they can see lord come on there is blessings in the suffering it's blessings if i hold out it's blessings if i live oh god according to what you asked me to do god come on hallelujah and i believe that with all of my heart oh glory to god come on what grieves god let's look here at hebrews 4 by god's grace 4-1 it says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us to enter into his rest less less a promise being left us of entering to his rest any of you should seem to come short of it come on you know like we was talking about that he's talking about that natural rest but today what we're looking at we're looking at entering to the true rest come on entering into the the baptism of the holy ghost a place the way you resting from your your sinful works your labels a place to where like we says the battle is over because why greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he said let us fear come on unless lest any of you would come short of that promise come on he says and not enter in you know paul laying it out here he says fear what it is he says i want he said let us fear he says don't don't fall short of it come on don't get to the place and fall short you know i believe that he says in one place he says you did run well you ran well but what hindered you come on you ran you ran the race but when you got to the finish line you didn't cross over come on he says don't fall short of it but run you know those runners when they see that they might be running and jogging but when they see the finish line in their view you know they might be tired they might be on their last leg but it's something when they see the finish line they give it all they got they give it to the body drop why the run that's the hardest they're gonna run when they see the finish line they might have been running but they're gonna run even harder when they can see the end why because the end is near so we got to run harder and i want to say you might have been running but i want to i want to encourage you today you we see the end is now how you know the end is now because we see the pestilence and the things coming on the earth we see that that the prophecy is being fulfilled we see that that everything is coming to a head now we see that god has given us no other way of escape but him come on the the medical world ain't gonna say that they failed you because they doing their best but god is allowing things to come up in from every in the job world economy busted come on there's no other way out but look up come on there's no other way out but get down on your knees and say lord here it is lord we're at the finish line we got to run now if i prayed uh if i ever prayed i really got to pray now but i ever pressed i really got to press now hallelujah because i see the finish line right there and i'm gonna run with all i got god oh hallelujah when i get to the end even when i don't have enough watch god come down watch those angle wings come down and bear you up and pick you up and carry you on across the finish line i believe that with all of my heart god ain't gonna let you just fall and die he gonna say i saw you pressed i saw you gave it all you got hallelujah and i'm gonna take you the rest of the way and i believe that oh i believe that with all of my heart so what it is he says he says let he says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of enter into his rest any of you should come short don't come short of it come on i said go in that's what i'm saying you know we're looking at god giving us a warning he says i want to i believe paul writing uh god was giving us a warning come on don't be like them i want to show you how to they mistakes where they fell short don't you fall short he says he didn't even consider a lot of the other things he says but what where they fell short at was because of their unbelief where they got me upset with them well i swore by my wrath because all i'd done for them and they wouldn't believe me they refused to go in come on and i'm warning you don't you be like them but you go in come on when you get to the land don't you don't you start uh doubting and having faith but you keep pressing come on you keep fighting come on fight your way into the kingdom press your way into the kingdom the bible says he says that when john i believe talking about the kingdom of god he says that he said that every man come on you got the pressure into it come on he said the violent they gonna take it by force come on press your win to it fight your way into it don't come short take it by force it's mine healing is mine deliverance is mine the holy ghost is mine god promised it to me i'm taking it by force i'm not asking the devil for it to leave me and back up come on taking it because god gave it to me hallelujah and that's what it is taking it and like how here it says in the second verse he says for unto us was the gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith of them in them that heard come on he said the word was preached to them come on for their day he says but it didn't profit them come on he said the word it didn't profit him the reason why i didn't profit them he said because they didn't mix it with faith come on they had they had the word and but they didn't they didn't have faith they didn't mix it with faith come on all of the word when you get in the word you know i like how the song says every time i hear god's word something in my heart gets stirred and i can feel the praises of rumbling in my soul come on that's what the word has got to do to if the word ain't stirring your heart come on the words got to stir your heart when it stirs your heart it's a faith what it is arising because something in you believing in what it said you believe that the word is true you believe that god is gonna come through you believe that god is gonna do what he says that's why it gives you joy unspeakable and full of glory why because you hearing the word something your heart gets sturdy you begin rejoicing oh thank you lord thank you god in the midst of what i'm going through i heard the word i believed it weeping may endure for a night but joy is coming in the morning something in my heart is dirt you say why are you praising god shouldn't you be looking at the things around you no i'm looking up i'm looking to the hills i see jesus i don't see my troubles i don't see my situation i see the promises of god i see god being who he said he was and who he promised he'll be more now than ever hallelujah i believe the word mix it he said it didn't profit them i asked the question is the word profit in you come on or is it not are you getting or you say the profit come on are you getting the full benefits out of the word come on are you seeing the dividends like let's say come out of the word are you seeing is the word profiting you or is it just with casual we just hell we yeah went to church had another good service what oh come on but it's the word profit in you are you coming out strong are you coming out better because that's what it is you know like we were saying those trials and tribulations what are they doing they building you come on to be better to be to be stronger i always like that how how uh and i use it all the time the example of david on the on but out there heard in the sheep come on what it was his trials and the things that he was faced with it was building them it was shaping and molding them making them until he and to who he was that he come to a place that you know no weapon come on formed against me is going to prosper he can write beautiful scriptures because he know he says he says the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want come on god has provided all my needs come on i don't know who your shepherd but i don't know who providing your needs but he said the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want i believe he said that i've never seen the righteous forsaken nor is seed begging for bread come on god in the door every door closed like we say he opened a window some way god's going to find a way to pour out blessings in your life and i thank god for that and we don't just serve because of the blessings but we serve him because of who he is hallelujah and what he can do for us oh god thank you i said it's what it is all those things were doing what building building david into who he was come on david didn't just know that uh god's children was going to possess the gates of his enemy just from a promise yes he know that but he believed that come on he mixed it with faith when that bear came he mixed it with faith when that lion came mixed with faith when goliath when goliath came out he says come on he says uh-uh he says ah he says y'all afraid oh come on y'all i thought after the promises that god made us y'all got the word why not mix it with faith come on believe hey come on you say this this man he defined the armies of the living god come on i know what he looks like but we ain't worried about that he he defying god he defined the army to live god gave us a promise come on he went out there he says you come to me with what the sword and the spirit but i come to you in the name of the lord come on in this day he said everybody gonna know that there's a god in israel hallelujah i said god that's what it is we got to come to the point that all of it is over and say this day the world gonna know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever they talked about them enough they they they uh what you call it mock them enough and they're still going around playing but this day the world gonna know that his power is still the same he's still the same he's not dead locked up in a tomb somewhere but he's still here on the earth we're walking around in two feet and you and i do the baptism of the holy ghost god being made manifest again do you and i come on doing the same works that he done he's the same yesterday today and forever and this day hallelujah the world gonna know that we believe he said being mixed with faith come on he says here in the third verse he says for we which have believed do enter into his rest as he says as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on the wise and god did rest on the seventh day from his works but i like how he says that in the third verse he says although he said the works were finished from the foundation of the world come on i said don't grieve god tonight what grieves them what makes them angry what upsets them what hurts them come on what hurts god people don't believe them what hurts what makes them upset because people won't go in come on it's that not that like we were saying it's not the sin that separates you it's because god made a way for you a provider he provided a way for you come on he said these works were done for the foundational world god made a way for you come on you were born in in sin iniquity you know and all those things did your mother conceive you you know we know that but even in that when you were yet without hope the bible say christ died for the ungodly come on god even though you were worthy to go to hell you were you were condemned from the very beginning god made a way for you god said even though you were in egypt i brought you out come on even though you were in the desert i fed you i gave you water come on now you come up to the land and i want you to go in come on i made a way for you to get back to the tree of life i made a way to you for you to come um beyond the veil to the holiest of holies come on come on back in there have communion with me don't be like those that didn't enter in come on in come on come on in have that fellowship have that communion with god amen let us just bow our heads father in the name of jesus christ lord we thank you lord god for lord your people don't want to grieve you lord today lord you

no man can buy not sell some folks say they can do it overnight because all the money the trillions the millions that they're giving out now they got nothing to back it up no gold standard no nothing

superman to appear when he steps out on the scene with the answers to the problems that the world is facing the world are gladly received the antichrist won't be long brother sister the world would find their superman because they ex rejected jesus christ the word because of rejection of jesus christ's word as they rejected him when he was manifested in flesh now he's revealed in his own word
