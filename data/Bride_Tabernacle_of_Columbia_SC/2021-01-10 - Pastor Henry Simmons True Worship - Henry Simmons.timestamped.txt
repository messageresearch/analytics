[27:36] I I was thinking about what would stop
[27:39] you and I from praising
[27:41] God what would stop you limit your
[27:45] worship and I noticed
[27:49] that the devil is against true
[27:53] worship and the devil amen he wants to
[27:57] divide a scheme
[27:58] whereby he would
[28:01] interfere and causes your worship to be
[28:06] limited you know sometimes when people
[28:09] cannot come in these large
[28:11] Gatherings then their worship
[28:15] cease people are are limited because
[28:19] they are used to having
[28:22] uh Worship in a certain way but the
[28:26] Bible tells us when two or three are
[28:27] gathered in my name he said D I'm in the
[28:31] midst we are finding that people are
[28:34] finding a
[28:35] way to praise God in spite
[28:38] [Music]
[28:39] of people are having Church in their
[28:43] homes with their
[28:45] families and they're worshiping
[28:48] God and a lot of those folks are
[28:51] expressing that they actually putting
[28:54] their
[28:55] worship on the internet
[28:59] and uh and and they're encouraging not
[29:01] only their families or those loved ones
[29:04] and Facebook and Instagram and all of
[29:08] that they're they're worshiping
[29:11] God some don't sound too good but
[29:14] nevertheless they might sound good to
[29:16] themselves like I sound good to myself

[41:14] John 4 and
[41:19] 23 I said there's a lot of things I
[41:22] wanted to complete Friday
[41:24] night but as I began to being being
[41:27] proud I said I can't all I can think
[41:33] about is I think the devil is start
[41:36] trying to limit our praises and trying
[41:38] to stop the sints of God from really
[41:42] praising God and worshiping
[41:46] God I believe Psalm is giv in to amen
[41:50] the conon crafts whereby amen the devil
[41:53] has slipped in to the homes and to the
[41:56] families and
[41:57] people amen yes they're tuning in Amen
[42:00] to the services and all but somehow amen
[42:04] the joy of being together the devil has
[42:07] stolen that away from the hearts of the
[42:10] people I'm not saying you have to be
[42:12] here but I'm talking about I want you to
[42:15] be in worship it don't matter where you
[42:18] are amen I want you to give God thanks
[42:21] and give God praise no matter where you
[42:25] are if you're at home are you on the job
[42:28] I want you to begin to praise God more
[42:30] than you ever praised the Lord before
[42:33] because the devil is trying to take away
[42:35] your
[42:38] worship are you with
[42:42] me there's all there's been a war in
[42:45] heaven that took place in heaven when
[42:47] the uh Lucifer was upset because he
[42:51] wanted Amen to be worshiped he wanted
[42:54] God's Place amen and the devil amen that
[42:57] because he had all these musical
[43:00] instruments that he was made up of that
[43:02] he wanted to amen thought that he should
[43:04] be the one amen that everybody was
[43:07] supposed to be bowed and down and
[43:09] worshiping are you with
[43:11] me sometimes because of the beauty amen
[43:15] people amen get stuck up in how nice the
[43:18] church look how nice the building is how
[43:20] nice the choir sing amen they think amen
[43:24] and the people lose focus and lose their
[43:26] attention
[43:27] and they think amen how intelligent the
[43:30] preacher he is and how amen but this
[43:33] thing comes down to your individual
[43:36] Revelation amen true worship amen has
[43:39] had to be revealed to you as an
[43:41] individual as it was in the days amen of
[43:44] Cain and AA amen Cain amen bought of the
[43:48] fruit of the ground he thought that he
[43:50] had a true revelation of what God wanted
[43:53] and maybe he didn't care amen he was
[43:55] interested in what wanted to give
[43:59] God Amen and some folks amen have come
[44:02] to the point amen that they in their
[44:05] spirit and in their mind amen says well
[44:09] amen this is what I'm going to give you
[44:12] God but by Revelation AA amen knew what
[44:16] God was requiring and what God
[44:19] wanted amen by Revelation you must uh
[44:22] understand what God is requiring and
[44:24] what God wants uh for you amen as an
[44:27] individual amen forget about everybody
[44:30] else but you as an individual you can't
[44:32] think about what amen God re requiring a
[44:35] mama a daddy or husband or wife you must
[44:38] know what God is requiring of you as an
[44:41] individual and Lord what you requiring
[44:44] of me that's what I want to give
[44:47] you amen as God is requiring every
[44:50] Church AG in Ephesus amen he had
[44:53] somewhat against them because they had
[44:55] left their first love and those that
[44:57] overcame in that age God had a reward
[45:00] Amen to the Overcomer amen and God Amen
[45:04] saw amen that the church was aiming at
[45:07] God but it got relaxed amen and so God
[45:10] knew the status in the state amen and he
[45:13] knew what it would take for them to
[45:14] overcome in that age and God would give
[45:17] them amen a revelation for the age that
[45:20] they will living in amen that they could
[45:23] overcome the schemes and the Ws of the
[45:26] devil
[45:27] brother and sister Amen in every age
[45:30] we've been under attack of the
[45:32] enemy praise God in th they had the
[45:36] spirit of Jezebel they suffered that
[45:39] woman Jezebel to teach amen and seduce
[45:42] God's people amen praise God they knew
[45:45] that this was the age of a dominating
[45:48] female and that female was just not a
[45:51] woman but it was the church amen that
[45:53] have taken amen dominion over the people
[45:56] amen the people had fell in love with
[45:59] the church and the church was taking
[46:01] preeminence over the people Amen in
[46:03] Jezebel as she had crept in Israel in
[46:07] the days of Ahab amen and she had caused
[46:10] the children of Israel to worship baale
[46:13] so Jezebel had crept into the church in
[46:17] the thar Church age and caused the dark
[46:20] ages of history that come into be amen
[46:24] but God knew that the amen the ref would
[46:27] take place later amen and he saw amen
[46:31] that the true worshipers amen would come
[46:33] out amen from what looked like it was
[46:36] dead and there was no hope amen but
[46:39] there was a root amen praise God down in
[46:42] the ground that was going to spring up
[46:44] the blade uh amen the cor of weak going
[46:47] to fall in the ground and die but it's
[46:50] going to come up again and I thank God
[46:53] that the church amen began to experience
[46:56] an Resurrection Amen in the s's age it
[47:00] means Escape ones amen praise God it's
[47:04] time to escape out of her my

[1:06:13] on he says shaken in mind and Trouble by
[1:06:18] Spirit not by word either by letter as
[1:06:21] for us as that day of Christ is at hand
[1:06:26] I
[1:06:27] believe I was
[1:06:30] reminiscing going back in my
[1:06:33] mind what kind of church in anticipation
[1:06:36] of the coming of the Lord back there
[1:06:39] 2,000 years I believe the church was
[1:06:42] under great expectation that the Lord
[1:06:44] was soon to come and they were even
[1:06:47] saying for the coming of the Lord draw
[1:06:51] nigh I believe that they were
[1:06:53] anticipating and and you know I believe
[1:06:57] that they waited in their day under
[1:06:59] great anticipation of the Rapture and
[1:07:02] the changing of the body the different
[1:07:04] things that uh Paul was preaching back
[1:07:07] there and I believe amen if we were to
[1:07:09] look back in those days uh amen those
[1:07:12] people were amen anticipating the coming
[1:07:15] of the Lord and they were on fire for
[1:07:17] God Amen we have experienc in our last
[1:07:21] day amen in the 60s where the great
[1:07:24] Revival took place God sent a prophet to
[1:07:26] the age amen One locking to Moses and
[1:07:30] One locking to Elijah and uh it was to
[1:07:32] stir amen signs and wonders and amen and
[1:07:36] Gifts amen of the Holy Ghost God had
[1:07:39] moved in such a supernatural way and yet
[1:07:42] uh 50 some odd years later amen look
[1:07:45] like the church has been swep in US gone
[1:07:48] to
[1:07:49] sleep are you with me and they're saying
[1:07:53] we waited long enough
[1:07:57] we waited long
[1:07:59] enough where is the promise of his
[1:08:02] coming oh yes so the people will look at
[1:08:06] and with disdain the Bible
[1:08:09] today so many have lost confidence in
[1:08:12] the Bible
[1:08:13] today yet they go to church and yet they
[1:08:16] sing and so they make up their own
[1:08:18] standard that they going to live by each
[1:08:21] church and made their own
[1:08:23] standard and they're worship God
[1:08:25] according to their own
[1:08:28] persuasion no more does the bible hold
[1:08:31] the standard the absolute in the church
[1:08:34] is the church amen has become their own
[1:08:38] absolute are you with me but brother and
[1:08:42] sister the word of God Is
[1:08:44] Right praise God and somebody said I

[1:09:33] those Nays sales saying I don't believe
[1:09:36] it
[1:09:37] anyhow because it took too
[1:09:41] long praise God it might have took a
[1:09:44] long time for a woman to become the vice
