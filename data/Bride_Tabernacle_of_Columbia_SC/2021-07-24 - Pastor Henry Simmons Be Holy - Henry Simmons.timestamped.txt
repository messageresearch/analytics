[30:44] i'm just going to go first peter
[30:50] 1 and 12
[30:53] 1 and 12 i said 13 but 1 and 12.
[30:56] first peter 1 and 12.
[31:00] unto whom it was revealed
[31:04] that not unto themselves but unto us
[31:09] they did minister the things
[31:12] which are now reported unto you
[31:16] by them that have preached
[31:19] the gospel unto you with the holy ghost
[31:23] sent down from heaven
[31:26] which things the angels desire to look
[31:30] into wherefore
[31:34] girder up the lawns of your mind
[31:40] be sober and hope
[31:43] to the end for the grace
[31:47] that is to be born unto you
[31:50] at the revelation of jesus christ
[31:55] as obedient children not
[31:58] fashioned in yourselves according to the
[32:01] former
[32:02] lust in your
[32:05] ignorance but as
[32:09] he which has called you
[32:13] is holy so be ye
[32:16] what be holy in
[32:20] all what
[32:24] because it is written be
[32:28] ye what for what
[32:32] and god bless you to read this word you
[32:34] may receive it
[32:38] said tonight be holy amen
[32:43] you know i
[32:47] i thought about you know
[32:50] it says just meditating upon the lord
[32:54] what does it mean to be holy
[32:59] what is your definition of
[33:02] holiness or to be holy
[33:05] because i believe people have lost
[33:10] the understanding they used to be a day
[33:13] when you can look at a young lady
[33:17] say that's a holiness person
[33:23] you can look at a young man he said he
[33:25] shows something different about houston
[33:27] young man
[33:29] but we're living in the lies as the oh
[33:33] i'm an old folk now the old folks used
[33:36] to say
[33:37] we're living in the last evil days
[33:42] are you with me amen so we're living in
[33:44] the last days
[33:47] and brother and sister
[33:50] god's servant said the two vines would
[33:53] be so close together that they
[33:54] intertwined
[34:02] the reason why the tears and wheat
[34:06] would come together if you try to pull
[34:08] up one you might pull up the other two
[34:13] so this thing is going to be so tight
[34:16] right
[34:19] the gospel which we preach is tight but
[34:21] it's right
[34:23] [Music]
[34:28] it's got to be something that could
[34:30] discern
[34:32] between right and wrong
[34:36] that's why it's very important that the
[34:39] bride had the gift of discernment
[34:45] but we're coming to a place where
[34:49] there's no respect of authority
[34:52] nowhere authority
[34:56] is disrespected
[35:00] look at it out there on the street
[35:02] people don't respect
[35:04] the law enforcement they don't respect
[35:06] the president they don't expect
[35:08] they don't respect nobody there's no
[35:12] they don't respect the school
[35:13] teachers they don't really
[35:16] it's no respect
[35:19] we're living in a place where people
[35:22] don't
[35:23] do don't give reverence and respect and
[35:26] honor to nobody
[35:31] so it's difficult in this day
[35:37] to try to guide is the teachers in the
[35:41] school
[35:41] have a difficult job very
[35:45] much difficult because if they try to
[35:48] teach
[35:49] the children then their hands are tied
[35:53] by so many different
[35:54] laws and so many different things that
[35:57] they can't even
[35:58] talk to them about god
[36:03] it used to be that we would get up in
[36:05] the morning
[36:06] the first thing we would do when we get
[36:07] into class
[36:10] we will repeat a bible verse god should
[36:12] not steal
[36:15] god should not commit adultery i should
[36:17] not
[36:18] you know everybody go around the class
[36:20] and you do a bible verse
[36:22] you better not do that now
[36:26] isn't that right you might end up in
[36:28] jail or getting fired
[36:29] or something but
[36:33] and then the first thing come over the
[36:34] intercom throughout the school
[36:37] was a prayer to start of the day
[36:41] but you can't do that no more isn't that
[36:43] right
[36:44] so we are misplaced and
[36:48] misled so much and so uh
[36:51] that when you try to tell the people now
[36:54] the people say wrong is right and right
[36:57] is wrong
[37:00] they take the word and it doesn't mean
[37:02] this in greek and it doesn't mean that
[37:04] in hebrew
[37:05] and it doesn't mean that in arabic to
[37:08] you got to be
[37:09] a scholar
[37:12] it used to be that a preacher that
[37:14] couldn't read nor write
[37:17] could get the keys to the kingdom and
[37:19] jesus could have
[37:20] trusted him to preach the gospel amen
[37:25] i remember a preacher
[37:28] by the name of minister
[37:32] boston he couldn't read
[37:36] he said get me so and so on
[37:39] and then somebody read from god business
[37:42] and around here preach
[37:43] and he couldn't preach but he couldn't
[37:46] read
[37:48] but he could preach the word
[37:51] and so what i'm saying nowadays
[37:54] you almost have to have a phd a doctor
[37:59] degree for people to think that they're
[38:02] going to listen to you
[38:03] and i'm gonna tell you something that
[38:05] they're not gonna listen to you with a
[38:07] phd
[38:08] because this is the time of what people
[38:12] write right well
[38:15] the people it's got so chaotic and so
[38:18] confusing
[38:22] and god is not the author of what
[38:25] confusion so we're in a a place where
[38:31] as it was said the whole world would go
[38:33] insane
[38:34] we're living in an insane age
[38:38] the age of insanity
[38:41] that's why the people can do the things
[38:43] that they do and not
[38:46] feel condemned or shamed
[38:50] because satan has creeped into
[38:54] edgy excuse me can i say
[39:02] through educating the people
[39:06] and making them so intelligent
[39:11] like it was in the days of noah they
[39:13] didn't even believe it's going to rain
[39:18] and folk don't believe that it's going
[39:20] to come a time
[39:21] of judgment
[39:24] they don't believe that the world gonna
[39:28] burn
[39:29] as an oven they don't believe that it's
[39:32] gonna
[39:33] catch on fire just as they did not
[39:37] believe
[39:37] in the days of noah neither do they
[39:40] believe
[39:41] today things are going to happen
[39:46] before in this present evil
[39:49] age this evil
[39:53] age god's going to bring
[39:56] judgment upon this crooked and perverse

[42:29] the flesh
[42:30] night comes in the form of the revealed
[42:32] word
[42:33] he came in flesh and now he comes in
[42:37] word
[42:38] at the time of restitution he would send
[42:41] forth jesus christ which was before
[42:44] preached unto you are you with me
[42:48] so god has come in restoration of the
[42:52] word
[42:53] and he's been preached unto you
[42:56] which things the angels desire to look
[42:59] unto you
[43:01] amen so the angels just tried to see
[43:05] what you are able to see
[43:08] amen oh god
[43:16] well thank god let me just 22nd verse it
[43:20] says
[43:21] and except those days should be what
[43:25] listen listen what we are
[43:29] we're at the shortness of days
[43:34] except those days be shortened there
[43:37] shall be
[43:38] no one no flesh say
[43:44] i believe we get now
[43:47] i believe we're getting to a place
[43:51] we thought we were out of this and we
[43:54] want to go back to
[43:55] normal is it going to get normal are we
[43:59] going to ever get back to normal
[44:02] i don't know
[44:07] so the people said we don't want to go
[44:09] back to what we were
[44:10] if we don't go back to normal we want to
[44:13] act like we normal
[44:15] you see what i'm saying we want to act
[44:20] and we want to ex we want to go
[44:25] with the flow and we're going to act
[44:27] like everything it's all right when we
[44:29] know it ain't all right
[44:33] children gonna go to school act like
[44:36] there's no coronavirus act like
[44:41] they're gonna go to the ball games
[44:43] they're gonna go to this and they're
[44:44] gonna go
[44:44] act like it this don't exist
[44:51] people are going to die they're going to
[44:52] get sick they're going to do this
[44:54] but we're going to act like it don't
[44:55] exist
[44:58] are you with me see because they can't
[45:01] afford
[45:02] the world can't afford a stoppage again
[45:10] so in order not to stop
[45:13] they got to keep going if it costs
[45:19] because either way you do
[45:25] doom if you stop
[45:31] things are getting worse and worse
[45:34] all they have to do is stop and get
[45:35] right with god
[45:38] get in prayer fast and seeking god and
[45:41] say lord
[45:42] return back what you what would what
[45:43] would you you think
[45:45] they'll do that because why
[45:48] everybody got a different god
[45:53] the true and the living god they don't
[45:55] know who he is
[45:58] brother and sister they can't even find
[46:00] him they don't know who where they look
[46:03] why because even in the church
[46:07] they're supposed to be christians and
[46:09] preachers
[46:11] they're telling them hey everything is
[46:13] fine
[46:16] if this the different religions
[46:19] hindu buddha confucius and muhammad
[46:22] everything is fine all of them got to go
[46:25] the true god but to us there's only one
[46:27] god
[46:29] and his name is jesus christ
[46:34] are you look man so we're not afraid to
[46:37] say
[46:38] to us it's just one god and that's the
[46:40] lord jesus christ
[46:42] are you with me and if we gonna point
[46:45] you anyway we're gonna point you to
[46:46] jesus
[46:48] are you up there
[46:54] joshua no flesh should be saved
[46:57] but father what i remember preaching
[47:00] that summary before the election
[47:02] before the election those days
[47:05] should be shot 23rd then
[47:09] if any man should say unto you
[47:12] lo he is christ are there
[47:15] believing not for there shall
[47:18] arise false christs anointed ones
[47:22] in the end time false christs and false
[47:26] prophets and shall
[47:29] show great signs and what oneness
[47:34] amen and so much that
[47:38] if it were what
[47:43] they shall what
[47:47] brothers and sisters is going to be so
[47:49] close and so tight
[47:51] so straight
[47:58] that's why he gave some apostles some
[48:00] prophets some pastor some teach
[48:02] some advantages some pastors and
[48:03] teachers
[48:05] for the perfecting of the saints
[48:09] but they don't exist no more
[48:12] why because the people got a right to do
[48:14] like they won't live like they won't act
[48:16] like they won't
[48:19] they don't respect none no ministry
[48:24] no they just fake it
[48:30] they're not humble people no more the
[48:33] bible said it'd be proud
[48:35] bolsters
[48:39] no respect no more they don't respect
[48:43] ministries they don't spread
[48:45] what ministry do they respect
[48:50] their own sales lovers of their world
[48:55] more than love is the world they don't
[48:58] respect
[48:59] no ministry are you with me
[49:03] people don't respect mama they don't
[49:06] respect daddy
[49:08] they don't respect teacher they don't
[49:10] respect nobody
[49:12] we're living in a god have mercy
[49:16] you look children telling mama what to
[49:18] do
[49:20] they're telling daddy what to do little
[49:22] children

[49:27] six
[49:27] they're two and three bossing mom around
[49:32] come here baby i ain't
[49:38] come here come here darling
[49:42] they say just like them ain't going
[49:45] about their business
[49:48] you ever seen such a thing as patricia
[49:52] and am i telling the truth am i
[49:56] making these things up
[49:59] these children is something they come
[50:01] out
[50:05] a whole different thing a whole
[50:07] different world
[50:09] oh y'all young people y'all got
[50:10] something to deal with
[50:13] thank god somebody said thank god all
[50:16] mind grown
[50:19] they ain't gone
[50:23] they grown but not gone
[50:26] amen they might be out the house but
[50:28] they still with you
[50:31] why you know
[50:34] i'ma tell you another thing though the
[50:38] older people we old now
[50:40] so they might be around your feet but
[50:43] when they get old
[50:45] they'll be around your heart
[50:49] are you with me so you do more worrying
[50:52] about them when they get grown
[50:54] than you do when they're on your feet
[51:00] somebody so i ain't worried about them
[51:03] if you love them you care about them
[51:06] no matter what you you care about them
[51:12] somebody said you you you tell my
[51:15] children you're grown
[51:17] your daddy just called you
[51:20] you all right caleb how you doing son
[51:25] rachel how you doing you know
[51:29] i'm doing all right that you know you
[51:32] made it to your destination
[51:35] every one day that voice won't do that
[51:39] won't be able to check on you won't be
[51:42] able
[51:43] to care for you just show somebody care
[51:46] you'll be wanting to hear somebody would
[51:48] call you and check on you and won't
[51:50] you know you would want that
[51:54] you know my mama called me you know your
[51:58] mama can see
[51:59] henry you know she called me minister
[52:03] venice you all right i said yeah mom i'm
[52:06] fine
[52:08] just want to see yeah yeah and make sure
[52:10] everything's fine
[52:12] that small you know
[52:16] is that all right the mama care
[52:20] you know how it is
[52:24] you know when you get us you know
[52:27] you know you get up and you think i
[52:30] don't need that nah
[52:34] but you get up
[52:38] but when they don't do it
[52:41] and sometimes we feel a little free
[52:47] and we might do something that we
[52:48] wouldn't normally do
[52:52] but we'll do things when we think nobody
[52:54] cares
[52:56] and nobody got time for me
[52:59] you understand people do things because
[53:03] people uh
[53:07] they won't they want to hear that
[53:09] somebody cares somebody got time for you
[53:13] are you with me if it's ever been a time
[53:16] when
[53:16] people need some attention they need
[53:20] your undivided attention now
[53:23] these children and some of them grown
[53:28] they need a little bit more compassion
[53:31] and understanding from you
[53:34] that you didn't give them when they were
[53:36] little
[53:39] but you can redeem the time because the
[53:42] days are evil
[53:45] instead of telling them what they
[53:47] shouldn't do what they need to stop
[53:48] doing just give them some love
[53:53] give them a little your undivided
[53:56] attention
[53:57] do something for them
[54:01] it may not be birthday time
[54:04] it may not be a holiday time but reach
[54:06] out and show them your camp
[54:09] because if something happened to you you
[54:10] wish you will
[54:12] and it goes vice versa children
[54:16] it don't have to be mama birthday or
[54:17] daddy birthday
[54:19] a mother's day or father's day to show
[54:22] that you care amen
[54:25] i don't know why i'm saying these things
[54:28] but it must be for a reason
[54:30] are you open so i'm saying to you
[54:35] sometimes i get away from my subject but
[54:37] it's always for a purpose
[54:42] so let me just say god
[54:46] i'ma try to he says if it was possible
[54:55] you just see the very leg goodness he
[54:57] didn't just
[54:58] he didn't say he it is deceived elect
[55:02] he said the what
[55:05] the very elay
[55:08] he put emphasis on that they let you
[55:11] know
[55:12] don't you think
[55:15] that you're so special you can't be
[55:18] deceived
[55:21] don't you think you're so saved and so
[55:24] holy
[55:25] amen that you can't be deceived
[55:29] that's why i said it's a bad thing
[55:32] that nobody can tell you nothing
[55:40] you know if you set out and you know
[55:42] folk can tell you some stuff
[55:45] to keep you out a lot of trouble
[55:49] but when you're out on your own that
[55:50] you're so close to god that you talk to
[55:52] god and god you know god
[55:55] you know
[55:58] but you we need one another
[56:02] every one of us we need one another
[56:07] let me go back to peter here
[56:10] and i i wanted to play some emphasis
[56:13] there
[56:14] and maybe it don't go together as some
[56:17] scholars would
[56:18] bring it together but let me
[56:21] go back and put the emphasis here it
[56:24] says
[56:24] because i said people have an
[56:26] understanding in the concept of holiness
[56:30] and it used to be pretty much a person
[56:33] said it was holiness
[56:35] whether they were assembly of god
[56:38] church of god whether they were
[56:41] apostolic whether they were or this
[56:44] or that all holiness people looked alike
[56:50] you see no matter you were telling well
[56:54] that's your holy sister that might be a
[56:56] holy brother
[56:57] you know all holiness people had a
[56:59] distinguished
[57:01] way of caring themselves that they were
[57:04] different
[57:08] so you were different
[57:12] from the rest of the world the rest of
[57:13] the world got to
[57:15] have the um the ladies jordans
[57:19] and the ladies this and the ladies that
[57:22] they gotta
[57:23] keep up with the styles and the fashion
[57:26] of the world
[57:31] some folk can't afford it and some folk
[57:34] can't afford it
[57:38] but and i i i i don't want to get on the
[57:42] young people that
[57:43] feel like there's a need to do those
[57:45] things
[57:46] but i don't want you to have to do those
[57:48] things at the expense
[57:51] of mama not playing a light bill
[57:55] or you got to steal
[58:01] or you got to take some pills for your
[58:03] depression
[58:06] because you feel left out
[58:12] all you got to do is get god
[58:15] hey are you a man and then if god bless
[58:18] you with the lady's shoes
[58:21] you just weighing them abusing them and
[58:23] accusing them
[58:24] they mean they don't mean nothing to you
[58:26] thank god for them
[58:29] are you a man
[58:32] if they're gonna make you look down on
[58:35] somebody else
[58:36] and talk uh-huh you don't need that
[58:41] you're gonna get proud and head up and
[58:44] down and head to show
[58:45] no you don't need that but if you can
[58:48] walk humble
[58:51] amen you can pretty much
[58:54] write what you want longer just not
[58:57] ungodly
[58:59] are you with me
[59:03] so he says here
[59:10] the 16th verse and now i'm gonna try to
[59:13] conclude in a little bit
[59:14] it says be
[59:18] because it is written first peter
[59:21] you know 1 16 because it is written be
[59:24] ye holy for i'm holy you know
[59:29] can you imagine how jesus would look in
[59:32] this generation
[59:34] in this age that we're living in just
[59:37] think
[59:38] what kind of jesus would you picture in
[59:40] this generation
[59:42] how would jesus if he was born here now
[59:46] how would he look and what kind of jesus
[59:51] the holy god you know we know
[59:54] if anybody was holy jesus is holy
[59:58] he said for i am what holy
[1:00:02] so if you can imagine jesus but
[1:00:06] people to them the jesus
[1:00:10] the dale pitching in them in their mind
[1:00:15] i'm gonna tell you it's not it's not too
[1:00:18] good
[1:00:20] really because the image in which is
[1:00:23] being projected over the pulpit
[1:00:25] and being preached to them is a flashy
[1:00:29] cool slick hip jesus
[1:00:34] with diamond rings and watches and gold
[1:00:37] chains
[1:00:38] and all of that that's the kind of jesus
[1:00:41] you know what i'm saying dale

[1:00:47] around in jet
[1:00:48] planes and doing this and that you know
[1:00:52] a picture of a jesus how about a jesus
[1:00:55] that's
[1:00:56] low and meek and humble
[1:00:59] you know what i'm saying the picture of
[1:01:02] jesus
[1:01:02] amen that can walk and he can no
[1:01:07] a holy god let me let me just try to
