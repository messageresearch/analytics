[30:46] amen
[30:50] the book of matthew 13 as we stand for
[30:53] the reading of the word
[30:54] 13 and 36.
[31:07] 13 and 36
[31:11] then
[31:12] jesus sent
[31:14] the multitude away
[31:16] and went into the house
[31:19] and his disciples came to him saying
[31:21] declaring to us the parable of the
[31:24] terrors
[31:26] of the field
[31:29] and
[31:30] he answered
[31:32] and said unto them
[31:34] he that sword
[31:36] the good seed is the son of man
[31:39] the field is the world
[31:42] the good seed are the children of the
[31:44] kingdom
[31:45] but the tares
[31:47] are the children of the wicked one
[31:50] the enemy that soul
[31:52] them is the devil
[31:57] the harvest is the end of the world
[32:01] the reapers
[32:03] are the angels
[32:06] as therefore the tares
[32:08] are gathered
[32:10] and
[32:11] burnt
[32:14] in the fire
[32:16] so shall it be
[32:18] in the end of this world
[32:21] the son of man shall send forth his
[32:23] angels
[32:24] and they should gather out
[32:27] of his kingdom
[32:29] all things that offend
[32:32] and them
[32:33] which do iniquity
[32:36] and shall cast them into
[32:40] a furnace of fire
[32:42] there shall be wailing
[32:44] and gnashing of teeth
[32:48] then shall the righteous shine forth
[32:51] as the son in the kingdom of their
[32:53] father
[32:55] who
[32:57] has
[32:58] ears to hear
[33:00] let them hear
[33:02] god bless the reasons words you may be
[33:03] seated
[33:09] the 13
[33:11] chapters
[33:13] talks about
[33:20] the
[33:21] the tears
[33:22] in the wheat the wheat and the terrors
[33:27] and it was in a powerful form
[33:31] but jesus said to his disciples is given
[33:33] to you to know the mysteries of the
[33:34] kingdom but unto them i speak to them in
[33:37] parables
[33:39] so tonight we want to say the wheat and
[33:42] the terrors
[33:44] but
[33:44] we understand that certain things were
[33:46] to
[33:48] take place at the end of the world
[33:51] so
[33:52] at the hardest time this is
[33:55] harvest time the end of the world so all
[33:58] these happenings
[34:00] the culver 19 and
[34:02] all the different um calamities and the
[34:06] world is falling apart
[34:08] and just things that man cannot
[34:11] with all his efforts he cannot
[34:13] pull
[34:14] the different crises that are going on
[34:16] over the world you cannot handle it so
[34:20] by the grace of god is telling you amen
[34:23] that we're at the end we have gone to
[34:25] our limits
[34:27] we're going as far as man can go
[34:30] amen and what happens is total chaos
[34:34] after a while
[34:36] so we're going into
[34:38] the mind of men
[34:42] have gone totally insane
[34:46] so insanity has set in on the world
[34:51] but we want to understand
[34:56] the wheat and the tares
[34:58] we understand that the good seed
[35:02] amen
[35:04] are the children of the kingdom
[35:08] but let's just deal with the terrors
[35:12] the terrorists or the children of the
[35:13] what
[35:15] wicked one
[35:17] are you
[35:18] are y'all with me
[35:20] they're the children of the wicked one
[35:24] what we notice here
[35:26] in first john
[35:29] he said the enemy that sold the tares
[35:32] was the devil
[35:34] right
[35:36] first john 3 and 12
[35:40] the children of the wicked one
[35:44] now we got to understand that there are
[35:46] two seeds
[35:48] that the children of the kingdom and the
[35:50] children are the wicked one
[35:52] and in the end time in the heart end of
[35:54] the world
[35:56] there would exist
[35:57] the children
[35:59] of the kingdom the good seed and the
[36:01] tares
[36:02] at the end of the world he said let it
[36:04] be and at the end of the world
[36:09] amen a harvest they send forth his
[36:11] angels
[36:13] are you with me
[36:15] so we're at the end of the world and god
[36:17] has sent forth his angels
[36:21] and they'll it's going to be a
[36:22] separation time
[36:26] the tears are going to be gathered in
[36:28] the bundles
[36:31] to be burned
[36:33] amen
[36:36] so we understand that there's a
[36:38] gathering together of the wicked ones
[36:42] and there'll be amen
[36:44] the children of the kingdom
[36:47] the good seed
[36:49] are getting ready amen
[36:51] the great carbine
[36:54] is coming forth amen
[36:56] together the children of the kingdom
[37:00] amen
[37:01] god amen got a place for you and i
[37:06] as we call the rapture the marriage
[37:08] supper amen
[37:10] of the lamb
[37:12] amen it's going home time it's time to
[37:14] get out of this evil world
[37:17] for the god of this evil age
[37:21] it's satan
[37:23] so this is an evil age that we're in
[37:26] but we got to get out get ready to go
[37:29] home go to
[37:31] what god forbane for us before the
[37:34] foundation of the world
[37:36] god's folks saw you and he saw amen you
[37:40] in his mind and you were a thought in
[37:43] the mind of god
[37:45] amen but the thought when it's expressed
[37:48] is a word
[37:50] amen and the word in the beginning was
[37:53] the word the word was with god and the
[37:55] word was god
[37:57] amen
[37:59] so you were in the word is the sea
[38:03] are you with me
[38:05] the word is the seed
[38:07] and you the good seed that comes forth
[38:09] from the mind of god
[38:11] as through his full knowledge amen you
[38:14] were for ordained to come forth in the
[38:17] last days to recognize who you are
[38:22] that you come from god and you go back
[38:24] to god
[38:25] you are an attribute
[38:27] attribute in the mind of god
[38:30] amen praise god but you must be
[38:33] expressed in this last thing
[38:36] why my sheep know my voice
[38:39] and a stranger they will not follow
[38:42] amen what you hear is something inside
[38:45] of you that it quickens to you it makes
[38:47] it it makes sense to you
[38:50] it don't make no sense to the rest of
[38:52] the world
[38:53] but it it it's something that you find
[38:56] out they meant your father is calling
[38:58] you and your father happened to be the
[39:01] word
[39:03] it's jesus calling you back to where you
[39:06] were
[39:08] amen
[39:10] so here
[39:14] first john 3
[39:17] and 12.
[39:20] now we understand that the
[39:23] tares are the children of the wicked one
[39:25] he says not as cain
[39:28] who was what
[39:32] okay
[39:36] the 11th verse says for this
[39:40] is the message
[39:42] that you have heard from the beginning
[39:45] that you shall what
[39:48] see
[39:52] the love of god is agape love
[39:58] i was dealing with somebody not long ago
[40:01] and they can't seem to love their
[40:03] enemies
[40:05] you got to love them that despisefully
[40:08] use you and speak all manner evil
[40:10] against you falsely
[40:12] you got to love them to spit in your
[40:14] face
[40:17] are you with me
[40:20] but you cannot do it in
[40:23] your feeling your your
[40:26] worldly
[40:28] nature
[40:30] you have to have god's divine nature
[40:32] that comes with the holy ghost and
[40:34] that's a god pay love being bestowed
[40:36] upon you
[40:38] are you with me
[40:40] without that a god pay love why not you
[40:42] allow jesus christ to come
[40:45] down inside of you without the baptism
[40:48] of the holy ghost without the spirit of
[40:49] god you cannot love like that
[40:55] you can try
[40:58] it
[41:00] it'll be difficult for you and it'll be
[41:02] a lot of work
[41:04] and even though no matter how hard you
[41:06] work
[41:09] i just sometimes i
[41:11] when i was young i used to debate a
[41:14] little bit with the jehovah witness
[41:16] or maybe i'll debate a little bit with
[41:18] the mormons
[41:19] and the one thing they can't do they
[41:21] can't get upset
[41:23] and i know that so i would
[41:25] show them something in the bible
[41:28] and then
[41:30] get them pushing in the corner then they
[41:31] get upset i said no no no no you can't
[41:34] do that now
[41:36] so they supposed to keep calm
[41:39] but you you realize when you're showing
[41:41] them things in the bible that goes
[41:44] against what they've been taught
[41:46] then they begin to get upset
[41:48] because
[41:49] amen you began to expose the enemy
[41:53] are you with me
[41:58] but
[41:59] when people can push a button or they
[42:02] can say something to you
[42:04] to get you furious and get you uh blow
[42:07] you out of proportion
[42:09] the bible said be angry and what
[42:11] sin not
[42:13] are you with me
[42:14] but they almost are saying that they
[42:17] when they go out and witness they can't
[42:19] get angry
[42:21] it's all right for us to get angry but
[42:23] this tells us not to sin
[42:25] in their right
[42:30] it's difficult
[42:31] to get angry and don't sing
[42:35] are you with me that's why they tell
[42:36] them don't get angry
[42:38] because it's very difficult to get angry
[42:41] and don't sin
[42:43] okay
[42:46] it says here
[42:48] for this is
[42:49] that you love one another now that's
[42:52] something that
[42:53] the devil can love
[42:55] them to love them
[42:58] and you know my biggest problem in
[43:01] pastoring and teaching people
[43:03] people love
[43:05] who they want to love
[43:09] and that's the attributes of the tares
[43:14] they love this one they love that one
[43:16] and they don't like that one
[43:19] i can't stand that one
[43:22] so you can tell who's tears and who's
[43:24] weak
[43:25] by their fruits you shall
[43:28] know them isn't that right
[43:31] now if they're not born again but we
[43:33] have those that three kind of believers
[43:36] we have to make believers
[43:38] are you with me
[43:40] which are the hypocrites
[43:43] they say they could see but actually
[43:45] they're not
[43:48] you have the unbeliever and they know
[43:49] where they stand
[43:52] and then you have the true believer
[43:55] amen and you're going to be tested
[43:58] that the fruits that you bring forth on
[44:00] the tree of your life
[44:02] it's going to be manifested what you are
[44:06] are you with me
[44:07] so you got to be careful that you don't
[44:09] bring forth either free fruit
[44:12] for a good tree cannot bring forth what
[44:16] evil fruit
[44:18] amen
[44:20] you can't get sweet water and bitter
[44:23] water out the same fountain can you
[44:26] okay
[44:28] let's
[44:30] now i says love one another
[44:34] it's it it's all right
[44:39] to love this and they don't love that
[44:41] one
[44:45] you know people said well well it's it's
[44:48] in
[44:49] it's excusable
[44:51] excuse me
[44:55] it's some things in life that keeps you
[44:57] from going
[44:59] you know i'm attracted to the down and
[45:01] out and those that may have perhaps in
[45:04] the crack or the drug added or the
[45:08] the
[45:08] you know the prostitute or the
[45:11] uh the ones that seem to be the you know
[45:15] the lowest of the low i i'm kind of
[45:18] attracted to those type people
[45:21] you know it's a why i those are the
[45:23] people that i'm reaching now i'm
[45:25] reaching out
[45:26] i'm trying to identify with them
[45:28] but you know that most
[45:31] people that say they're christians they
[45:33] don't want to identify those type people
[45:36] matter of fact
[45:37] uh
[45:39] when jesus was identifying with them
[45:42] they said
[45:43] if he'd have known who this woman was
[45:45] that was uh kissing his feet and
[45:47] watching it
[45:49] you don't know who that woman is
[45:51] but jesus knew exactly who the woman was
[45:54] that was doing that to him
[45:56] oh you look man
[45:58] and then they brought the woman and
[45:59] called in the act of you know of
[46:02] adultery and uh you know
[46:04] and moses said she ought to be stoned
[46:06] what do you say
[46:09] you see what i'm saying
[46:11] a friend of centers and wine baglets
[46:14] what what what's wrong with you
[46:17] brother and sister we can get so
[46:20] sanctified and so holy that we don't
[46:22] want nothing to do with those that are
[46:24] down and now
[46:26] and that's what happens to the
[46:29] you know people forget what the lord
[46:32] where the lord brought him from
[46:34] forget what the lord done for them
[46:37] praise god they forget when god found
[46:40] them where they were
[46:42] you know but we could we should never
[46:44] forget what the lord has done for us and
[46:47] where he bought us from
[46:49] we should never forget that
[46:51] we always should be appreciated that god
[46:55] reached down to the lords he said i
[46:57] didn't call you because you were so holy
[46:59] and so righteous i didn't call you
[47:00] because you were greater than normal i
[47:02] didn't call you because you were so
[47:04] intelligent
[47:06] oh but god called you because of his
[47:08] grace and his mercy
[47:10] he chose us amen
[47:15] so he says here
[47:17] not his cain who was of the wicked one
[47:20] and slew his brother
[47:22] and wherefore slew he him
[47:25] because his own works were what
[47:28] you know sometimes we can put on a good
[47:31] show out front
[47:34] it's just like a white supplicant
[47:36] but the end one is full of dead men moan
[47:40] folk can put on a good show
[47:43] a good outward show
[47:45] look all pious and all holy but in their
[47:48] heart
[47:50] it's full of wickedness
[47:52] are you with me
[47:55] see we can look holy in front of
[47:56] everybody and look sanctified and look
[47:59] so uh righteous
[48:01] but if
[48:02] our heart is not right in the inside
[48:06] amen our actions gonna determine amen
[48:09] what's in our hearts
[48:11] are you with me
[48:13] so what's down in your heart it's gonna
[48:15] come out for under out of the abundancy
[48:17] of the
[48:18] heart the mouth was what
[48:21] speak
[48:23] are you with me
[48:25] so you end up speaking what's in your
[48:27] heart oh i didn't mean that certainly
[48:30] you didn't
[48:33] praise god
[48:35] i know peter said lord i never deny you
[48:38] and jesus said get behind me say
[48:40] sometimes satan can get in you
[48:42] but he don't not to be in you just it'll
[48:44] not be his house
[48:48] are you with me
[48:49] satan ought to be all tonight
[48:52] you know just dwell there all the time
[48:55] sometimes we can have a disposition
[48:59] that our disposition is not a loving
[49:02] disposition it's not easily to be
[49:04] entreated
[49:09] are you with me
[49:10] so we ought to have something
[49:12] uh
[49:13] seasoned with salt and
[49:15] we ought to be able to draw
[49:18] he said if i be lifted up by what
[49:22] i draw all men with love and kindness
[49:24] have you what
[49:26] yeah
[49:27] god does that
[49:29] not with this
[49:31] psychology intellectual conception
[49:34] but with simplicity amen
[49:36] not trying to be phony or educated and
[49:40] know what to say because you've
[49:43] learned it in theology school
[49:46] amen it's something that
[49:48] you are you know you don't have to teach
[49:50] us sheep how to grow war
[49:55] are you with me
[49:57] i want you to grow wool and you know i
[49:59] want you to go to
[50:01] uh college and get your phd
[50:04] and how to grow war
[50:07] are you with me
[50:08] so you we cannot teach you how to be
[50:11] christian you are christians because you
[50:14] are by nature
[50:17] by his divine nature because you've been
[50:19] born again and you are new creation in
[50:22] christ jesus because jesus christ
[50:24] resides and lives inside of you
[50:30] that
[50:30] makes you a son or daughter of god
[50:34] so your home
[50:36] so you all automatically you bring forth
[50:39] the fruits
[50:41] amen
[50:42] of the spirit
[50:45] now
[50:47] oh boy
[50:48] how can i get where i want to go
[50:51] let's go to revelation 12. okay we saw
[50:54] kane kane
[50:56] attributes he showed what he was
[50:59] you know somebody said well the children
[51:00] are the wicked one they ain't here no
[51:02] more
[51:03] well the bible says at the end
[51:11] so the enemy that sold the tares
[51:14] was the devil isn't that right
[51:17] revelation uh 12 and 9
[51:21] let's just say let's just go to seventh
[51:23] verse revelation 12 and 7. it says and
[51:26] there was war in heaven michael and his
[51:29] angels fought against the dragon and the
[51:31] dragon fought in his angels
[51:33] and prevailed not
[51:36] was their place found anymore in heaven
[51:41] are you with me
[51:42] see the devil come down to the earth
[51:45] amen he lost his position in heaven
[51:48] because he wanted to take over up there
[51:51] and because he wanted to get his pride
[51:53] he wanted to take over when god has
[51:55] positioned a place you've given you
[52:00] a position in him
[52:02] you must thank him for what he's given
[52:04] you
[52:06] and don't try to take some what god gave
[52:08] somebody else
[52:10] envy and jealousy
[52:13] as cruel as the grave
[52:16] are you look man so don't you try to
[52:18] take somebody else's position because
[52:20] somebody else can sing you're gonna take
[52:22] voice a lesson
[52:27] amen god
[52:28] i got a thing like that
[52:31] somebody else can preach like this or
[52:34] teach oh i gotta go
[52:38] i can do it too i can do it better
[52:41] we're not in competition
[52:46] gives each and every one the measure of
[52:48] faith and gifts according to his own
[52:50] will
[52:52] are you with me
[52:53] if god has made you more intelligent
[52:55] than me thank god i can use that
[52:58] you're my brother amen if i need some of
[53:00] your intelligence i'm going to action
[53:03] because i know where to get that part
[53:04] from
[53:06] are you with me glad i got a brother
[53:07] that got it
[53:09] glad i got a sister that can do it
[53:12] oh you look man
[53:13] so instead of being happy for one
[53:16] another sometimes we become envious and
[53:18] jealous and that's what cain's spirit
[53:20] was all about he hated his brother
[53:22] because his this this stuff was evil you
[53:25] know
[53:26] he was evil
[53:28] amen
[53:30] don't let us not get jealous of one
[53:32] another
[53:34] and envision one another
[53:36] see we can thank all kind of thoughts
[53:39] oh listen all that don't let the devil
[53:42] play with your mind forget about it i
[53:44] love my brother
[53:47] okay
[53:49] so he says
[53:50] um
[53:52] fault
[53:53] he said in the eighth verse he says 12-8
[53:56] he said and prevailed not neither was
[53:58] the fine place
[54:00] anymore in heaven so the ninth verse and
[54:02] the great dragon
[54:04] was what
[54:06] was cast out the old that old what
[54:10] serpent called what
[54:12] i wonder who's who sold the tares
[54:16] the devil sold it isn't that right
[54:19] wonder who talked to eve in the garden
[54:24] that old serpent
[54:26] isn't that right
[54:30] so who got see the serpent was just like
[54:32] uh
[54:34] uh
[54:35] one of the cattle on the field and even
[54:37] more subtle than every beast
[54:39] he wasn't a reptile he was a beast
[54:42] see what i'm saying that's why the
[54:44] beasts in the beginning and the beasts
[54:46] in the end would be the same one the
[54:47] mark of the beast
[54:49] they put a mark upon cain isn't that
[54:51] right
[54:52] so uh the beast in the beginning would
[54:55] be the beast in the end
[54:57] and the mark of the beast that was on
[54:59] king would be the mark of the beast
[55:02] at the end time
[55:04] are you with me so we are in that age
[55:07] where things are
[55:09] coming together there's a united time
[55:12] and sign and everything is coming to
[55:14] unite
[55:16] amen so we we're uniting with him the
[55:19] word
[55:21] praise god
[55:22] the head and the body is coming together
[55:26] are you with me
[55:27] your headship has come
[55:30] to connect with the body which is the
[55:32] bride
[55:34] which is the wife
[55:35] the husband and the wife of one
[55:38] jesus is the head of the body
[55:41] and the body is the church
[55:43] amen isn't that right
[55:45] and there must be a connection
[55:48] amen praise god but you know israel the
[55:51] jews rejected their headship
[55:54] the head came to the body amen the
[55:56] messiah came
[55:58] and they said he's not our king
[56:01] amen they said he he's a devil he's
[56:03] reasonable
[56:06] are you with me
[56:08] when they rejected him then he turned to
[56:10] the gentiles isn't that right
[56:12] so by the grace of god now amen there's
[56:14] a rejection again he come to the church
[56:17] and the church put him out
[56:19] and then they ought to see he's on the
[56:20] outside knocking on the door and they
[56:22] won't let him in
[56:25] why they're too busy in their
[56:26] intellectualism
[56:28] they meant they already got it all out
[56:30] playing out and all worked out and they
[56:33] know how to get to heaven just like they
[56:34] built a tower to help them
[56:37] are you with me
[56:39] so people are building their own tower
[56:41] their own
[56:42] ideas
[56:44] it's a mass chaos and confusion
[56:48] are you with me
[56:49] but in the midst of the chaos and the
[56:51] confusion they still want to come
[56:53] together and say let us be one in the
[56:56] midst of chaos isn't that a babylon
[57:00] amen
[57:01] oh god
[57:06] so
[57:07] he says
[57:08] the ninth verse again it says
[57:11] and the great dragon was cast out that
[57:14] old serpent called what
[57:17] and satan which what
[57:20] deceived who
[57:23] come on are you so smart you so
[57:25] intelligent
[57:27] you so whole and so right he deceives
[57:29] the what
[57:30] whole world
[57:33] amen
[57:34] so i'm gonna tell you the bible says
[57:36] he had to shorten the days for the
[57:38] election
[57:41] amen he said if it was apostle he'd
[57:44] deceive even the very lack isn't that
[57:45] right
[57:46] so aren't you glad god shot in the days
[57:48] for your sake
[57:50] amen god came by to get you in due time
[57:56] amen he knew that this was the season in
[57:58] hour he knew that oh god
[58:01] he held everything back how the four
[58:03] wins by that he could get his elect
[58:07] gather his leg
[58:08] from the four corners of the earth
[58:11] are you with me
[58:12] so i'm so glad god held everything up
[58:14] for me
[58:16] that jesus christ when i can recognize
[58:18] that the savior jesus christ has shedded
[58:21] his blood for me
[58:22] that he died for me
[58:24] and i could accept that thing
[58:27] praise god i could have went on through
[58:29] life and never accepted jesus christ
[58:32] amen his mercy and his grace for my life
[58:35] but thank god for his grace
[58:38] i got a lot to say but i got to cut his
[58:40] show
[58:45] i said i got to cut it real short today
[58:49] all all right tonight
[58:51] i think y'all can
[58:53] digest this and going on steady
[58:55] description
[58:58] just get a solo on the six
[59:04] let me go give give another scripture
[59:06] why josh is doing that okay
[59:08] genesis 6
[59:11] genesis 6
[59:13] while josh getting ready and caleb
[59:15] genesis 6
[59:17] and he says
[59:20] oh boy i got
[59:21] all what kind of scriptures but i can't
[59:23] give them all are y'all with me
[59:27] but
[59:29] and it came to pass
[59:30] when men began to multiply in the face
[59:32] of the earth and daughters were born
[59:35] unto them the sons of god saw the
[59:37] daughters of men that they were fair and
[59:40] they took
[59:41] unto them wives all of all which they

[59:51] for
[59:53] that he also is
[59:56] flesh yet
[59:58] his days shall be 120 years
[1:00:01] and there were giants
[1:00:04] in the earth in those days and also
[1:00:06] after
[1:00:08] that
[1:00:09] when the sons of god came unto the
[1:00:12] daughters of men and they
[1:00:14] bear

[1:01:11] women don't even care nothing about
[1:01:13] themselves
[1:01:15] they're doing any kind of evil wicked
[1:01:17] stuff
[1:01:20] if god didn't come by and save you you
[1:01:23] will be one of we were one of them

[1:01:37] he said he that has an ear to hear
[1:01:41] thank god that we could hear
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:47] okay he says
[1:01:49] every imagination
[1:01:51] and thought
[1:01:52] of his heart was only what
[1:01:56] evil what
[1:01:59] now you wonder what's going on i don't
[1:02:01] understand why people yeah i understand
[1:02:04] some of them just
[1:02:07] the enemy
[1:02:09] has children the devil had children on
[1:02:12] the earth
[1:02:13] children are the wicked one
[1:02:16] and they're children of god
[1:02:19] and you test them out see what they
[1:02:20] receive god's word
[1:02:22] you know
[1:02:24] tell you to be a rough name to be
[1:02:26] married to

[1:02:34] they don't want nothing to do with god
[1:02:37] wouldn't that mean something

[1:02:43] the people they saw the
[1:02:45] uh daughters of men they saw that they
[1:02:47] were beautiful
[1:02:49] and they went out the beautiful beauty
[1:02:52] instead of without a god after godliness
[1:02:56] amen we better go after godliness
[1:02:58] instead of beauty
[1:03:00] because that's where that's what
[1:03:02] happened to
[1:03:03] the days of noah that's why god
[1:03:05] destroyed the world
[1:03:08] are you with me
[1:03:09] so we're getting back he said as it was
[1:03:11] in the days of sodom and as it was in

[1:03:15] day when the son of man is revealed at
[1:03:17] this time we're we're back there again
[1:03:20] history repeating itself

[1:03:49] nothing here
[1:03:51] praise god let's get in christ let's
[1:03:54] recognize that he loves us and he's
[1:03:56] given us a way of means of escape that

[1:04:14] that's what god wants you to have joy
[1:04:16] the joy of my salvation
[1:04:19] the joy of being saved
[1:04:22] i said am i really do not really have
[1:04:25] joy
[1:04:28] you know sometimes we have to look at
[1:04:29] ourselves and see what do i really have
[1:04:31] joy
[1:04:33] we say the joy of the lord is my
[1:04:35] strength do i really have joy
[1:04:38] amen then if i if i'm not really
[1:04:42] living a life with of happiness and joy
[1:04:46] and peace and you know the bible said
[1:04:48] the kingdom of heaven is not mean to
[1:04:50] drain but it's righteousness peace and
[1:04:53] joy in the holy ghost
[1:04:55] ain't that right
[1:04:56] but you see you know so many people they
[1:04:59] don't have joy
[1:05:01] amen that's why they go to the world and
[1:05:04] they go to drinking go to uh
[1:05:06] getting high they want joy
[1:05:09] it makes them laugh a little while make
[1:05:11] them forget about
[1:05:13] their troubles and their problems for a
[1:05:15] little while but once they come off the
[1:05:17] high
[1:05:18] they're still down
[1:05:20] so they want to go back i don't want to
[1:05:22] live in this world because it's no peace
[1:05:24] i don't i'm not happy
[1:05:27] are you with me
[1:05:29] but he said my peace i give you not as
[1:05:31] the world guilt
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:34] he said i give you joy unspeakable and
[1:05:36] full of glory
[1:05:38] but we find so many people amen that
[1:05:40] says i'm a christian but they don't have
[1:05:42] the joy

[1:07:13] they look dollar bills and they feel
[1:07:15] good
[1:07:16] and glad to serve the lord amen
