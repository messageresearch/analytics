[30:11] saint luke the ninth chapter
[30:14] one through six and then romans
[30:18] one
[30:21] saint luke 9 1 through
[30:24] 6.
[30:28] then he called his 12 disciples together
[30:32] and gave them power in authority
[30:37] over all devils and to
[30:40] cue diseases
[30:44] and he sent them to preach the kingdom
[30:46] of god
[30:48] and to heal the sick and he said unto
[30:51] them
[30:52] take nothing for your journey neither
[30:54] styles nor script neither bread
[30:57] neither money neither have two coats of
[31:00] peace
[31:02] and well silver she enter into
[31:05] they abide and this depart
[31:08] and whosoever will not receive you when
[31:11] you go out of that city
[31:12] shake off the very dust from your feet
[31:15] for a testimony against them
[31:18] and they departed and went through the
[31:20] towns
[31:22] preaching the gospel and healing
[31:25] everywhere the book of romans
[31:30] the first chapter
[31:37] romans 1
[31:44] and 16
[31:48] paul here was saying i am not ashamed of
[31:52] the gospel of
[31:53] christ for it is the power of god
[31:57] until salvation to everyone that
[32:00] believeth
[32:02] to the jew first and also
[32:05] to the greek father bless your word
[32:08] tonight
[32:09] in jesus name amen amen may be seated
[32:16] i want to use for a little
[32:19] thought tonight as i was
[32:23] reading something this morning in
[32:27] uh as i was reading my little morning uh
[32:30] devotional and in the family alter book
[32:34] uh
[32:35] it came out with
[32:39] what paul here was saying in the book of
[32:42] romans 1 that
[32:43] i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ
[32:47] for it is the power
[32:50] of god amen
[32:53] and as i looked at that and
[32:57] it did something
[33:01] to me
[33:04] and as i began to search it out in
[33:07] scriptures and things began to come to
[33:10] me
[33:12] and i began to look at the word
[33:16] i began to look at the disciples
[33:20] here that even before
[33:24] the holy ghost even was given to him
[33:28] in luke it says that then he called the
[33:31] disciples together
[33:34] and gave them power in authority
[33:40] god gave them something
[33:46] because of the gospel
[33:50] of jesus christ it has
[33:53] power in it
[33:58] and i believe if it had power then
[34:02] i believe it got power now
[34:07] but notice that the people
[34:10] has to have faith that what god
[34:14] gave them
[34:17] that it hasn't changed
[34:22] so many times we theological
[34:26] try to take that part of the scripture
[34:31] out and say that was only for
[34:35] back then but my god in hebrews 13
[34:39] 8 said jesus christ is
[34:44] not was but is the same yesterday
[34:49] today and if it is
[34:52] then is doing it right now again
[34:58] let me read something book of hebrews
[35:03] i got a little stirred about it
[35:08] because i believe that
[35:12] the hebrews the fourth chapter
[35:16] i realized that we have heard great
[35:19] sermons and we've heard preaching of the
[35:23] word and
[35:25] god first commissioned that he gave the
[35:28] disciples in matthew
[35:30] 10 was to go ye out and
[35:33] heal the sick
[35:37] see god just didn't give him just the
[35:40] letter of the gospel but
[35:42] the word had something in it
[35:45] to do something
[35:50] and that gospel that they had and the
[35:53] gospel that
[35:55] we got it's the same gospel
[36:01] it's not another jesus that we are
[36:03] preaching but
[36:04] it's the same jesus
[36:08] we all the time like to say quote the
[36:11] scripture but
[36:13] i wonder sometimes do we really believe
[36:16] that
[36:17] he is the same
[36:20] can the word still produce
[36:24] the power that it did in the bible days
[36:28] well no we're not just living in a
[36:30] historical
[36:32] time that what god used to do and
[36:35] and what god used to can do no i'm
[36:38] living in a right now
[36:40] present tense
[36:45] yes so right now god
[36:48] god that is more than able
[36:51] to still heal the sick
[36:56] we are witnesses and we have testimonies
[36:59] that
[37:00] what god has done in our own
[37:04] very life that we can testify
[37:07] that i know he is a healer
[37:12] yes i know he is a provider
[37:16] i know he'll make a way when there
[37:19] isn't no way god does the
[37:23] impossible things that
[37:26] doctors can't even imagine and after
[37:29] they
[37:29] ran out of all of their resources
[37:33] god said don't worry about it my
[37:35] resources
[37:37] never runs out i'll make a way for you
[37:41] when
[37:41] when you can't even make a way for your
[37:44] own self
[37:45] that's the kind of god i'm talking about
[37:48] i'm talking about
[37:49] a supernatural god that does
[37:53] supernatural things
[37:56] oh yes there's no time now to just
[37:59] sit back and wonder uh whether he can do
[38:03] it no
[38:04] no no i believe he can do it
[38:09] amen the book of hebrews it says
[38:12] something here hebrews 4.
[38:20] four and two
[38:26] it says for unto us was the gospel
[38:28] preached
[38:30] as well as unto them
[38:33] but the word preach did not profit them
[38:38] not being mixed with faith in them that
[38:41] heard it amen
[38:44] in other words uh when you hear the
[38:47] gospel
[38:48] you've got to believe it by faith
[38:52] you've not only you act on
[38:56] what you hear because faith come by
[38:58] hearing
[39:00] and hearing come by the word but the
[39:02] bible says here that
[39:04] the word didn't profit them
[39:07] in other words they didn't really get
[39:08] the full benefit
[39:11] from it because it wasn't mixed with
[39:14] fancy and the bible said faith
[39:17] is a substance of things
[39:20] hoped for and the evidence of things
[39:24] not seen see so faith the bible says
[39:28] it's impossible to please god
[39:32] without faith come on don't don't just
[39:35] get have a word just laying there and
[39:38] you don't
[39:39] apply faith to it amen i mean
[39:43] faith acts faith
[39:46] moves it moved because
[39:49] god said so not because
[39:52] of a certain preacher saying but god
[39:56] your word declared that you are more
[39:59] than able
[40:00] to do it and i'll believe it amen
[40:05] see it takes a odd person to to
[40:08] believe the word
[40:11] amen i want to go to another place here
[40:16] first corinthian
[40:20] oh my i'm telling you something
[40:24] i'm telling you if this word is not
[40:26] being activated
[40:28] uh in our own life i wonder sometime
[40:32] what word that you're listening to
[40:35] amen god word wants to do something amen
[40:39] it wants to root out amen those
[40:42] things amen that don't belong to you
[40:45] amen
[40:46] god wants to deliver you from every
[40:49] a habit and whatever the devil have been
[40:52] trying to
[40:53] hold you captive with come on god wants
[40:56] you to be
[40:57] loose
[41:00] but you get applied by faith
[41:04] first corinthians
[41:13] one
[41:16] oh my
[41:20] paul said here for christ sent me not to
[41:25] baptize
[41:28] but to preach the gospel
[41:32] not with wisdom of words
[41:35] lest the cross of christ shall be made
[41:38] of none effect
[41:40] 18 for the preaching of the cross is to
[41:43] them that perish foolishness
[41:46] but unto us which are saved it is the
[41:50] power of god amen
[41:54] see it seems odd to preach
[41:57] the cross and to preach amen the thing
[42:01] that
[42:01] jesus and man had done but to us
[42:04] it is the power of god
[42:07] amen god not only he has it but
[42:11] god gave it to us
[42:15] he gave it to the church
[42:19] to do something with it not not just a
[42:21] word and paul said that
[42:23] uh i didn't come to you with excellent
[42:26] speech or men wisdom he said no no but
[42:29] he said but i come to you
[42:31] in demonstration and power
[42:34] of the holy ghost
[42:37] what kind of a church don't have no
[42:40] power in it
[42:42] i'll be the prophet of god say god hates
[42:44] a powerless church
[42:46] come on god want a church a man that
[42:50] knows what he wants done with the word
[42:53] amen you got to understand what is that
[42:56] in your hand
[42:58] oh and then you got to use it it'll do
[43:02] you no good to have
[43:03] something and it just well i i got the
[43:06] message
[43:09] and yet you ain't doing nothing with it
[43:13] come on the message if it's really if
[43:16] you really have it within you
[43:18] it'll cause you to react
[43:22] it'll cause you a man to begin to use
[43:25] what god
[43:26] gave you come on you got situations and
[43:30] you got conditions and and you ought to
[43:33] know
[43:34] what you got in your hands see you got
[43:36] beginners brother ernest was saying
[43:39] begin to let the world be getting
[43:41] inspired
[43:42] and you start speaking
[43:47] no time to cry now come on we don't cry
[43:50] long enough
[43:52] come on we don't been church long enough
[43:55] we didn't hurt preaching long enough
[43:58] come on let's
[43:59] use it now let's take these things that
[44:03] we've heard all these years now and
[44:06] let's get
[44:07] really beginning to move with it we
[44:10] don't want to be like they were that
[44:12] it didn't profit but we wanted to profit
[44:15] us so we want to mix it with faith
[44:19] and say lord here i am god
[44:22] let the word materialize in my life
[44:26] break these demon powers
[44:29] oh yeah even sisters you can lay hands
[44:33] on the sick
[44:34] oh yes that's the commission you don't
[44:37] have to be a preacher
[44:39] it's to the believers let's go there
[44:44] book of mark
[44:49] i i looked and i said you know in
[44:52] matthew 10
[44:53] and in luke uh uh
[44:57] how that jesus gave them that authority
[45:02] and gave them the power to cast out
[45:05] devils
[45:09] before the holy ghost was even given
[45:14] and i began to say if they could had
[45:17] that kind of a
[45:19] authority meth mark 16 15
[45:22] if they could have that kind of
[45:24] authority and
[45:26] power before uh the holy ghost came
[45:30] what kind of people we ought to be
[45:34] with the holy ghost see come on the holy
[45:37] ghost ain't weak
[45:39] god ain't never lost his power
[45:42] god just needs somebody to activate
[45:45] their
[45:46] faith begin to step out and say
[45:49] lord i believe your word
[45:54] oh no when are we going to get up about
[45:56] our father's business are we going to
[45:58] wait
[46:00] i believe we're in the hour now that
[46:03] these devils that been lurking around us
[46:06] and these devils of sickness and these
[46:09] devils of of frustration and depression
[46:14] and
[46:15] all of these demonic forces that
[46:18] coming against us and we just sitting
[46:21] there allowing these things
[46:23] come on no no no you got to get up out
[46:26] of that situation
[46:27] you got to fight your way out you got to
[46:30] understand that
[46:32] i'm not just some idiot church god no
[46:36] i am a son and a daughter of god
[46:39] i am who god say i am
[46:42] and i take authority over these demon
[46:45] powers
[46:46] devil lose him
[46:49] oh yeah you sit there and just play with
[46:52] it and
[46:53] i like i don't know what to do
[46:56] oh i understand so much going on
[47:00] come on what you crying for
[47:03] come on know that i said that brother
[47:05] and i said again it's
[47:06] time to speak it's the hour that we've
[47:10] got to begin to move out
[47:14] you know and and stop this uh uh
[47:17] abounding also being
[47:19] limited to our own circumstances
[47:23] come on you can have authority over that
[47:26] because i heard all pastors saying that
[47:29] but you know
[47:30] out of the abundance of the heart the
[47:32] mouth speak it
[47:35] see what's in you is going to come out
[47:39] and that's why he's saying if my word
[47:42] abiding you
[47:44] amen and you about it then you can ask
[47:47] what the preacher will no no
[47:50] ask what you will see
[47:53] you've got to understand we've heard and
[47:57] we've
[47:57] read it and we have you know heard it
[48:00] like an old proverb but
[48:02] it got to still it got to do
[48:06] something on the inside of us
[48:10] i mean you just can't just sit let the
[48:13] word just lay there say well
[48:15] i know yeah that is what the bible said
[48:18] and
[48:19] that is what jesus said
[48:22] oh no you just don't want to be that
[48:24] kind of christian
[48:27] see that the word didn't profit them
[48:29] because it wasn't
[48:30] mixed with faith see
[48:33] faith don't look at symptoms
[48:37] faith don't look at how i feel
[48:41] because these five senses and what
[48:43] really paralyzes us
[48:46] we're living on in this outer rim and we
[48:49] should be
[48:50] living in the interim we should be a man
[48:54] in heavenly places and understand that
[48:57] no weapon form against you
[49:00] shall prosper he didn't say it won't
[49:04] come but he said it won't prosper
[49:08] so if it won't prosper then there's
[49:10] something that god
[49:12] has given us amen that we can come out
[49:15] of this
[49:16] situation how long do you want to stay
[49:19] in it
[49:21] oh brother shelly say lives ago
[49:25] when do you want these frogs to leave
[49:29] somebody said well maybe when the doctor
[49:32] give
[49:32] me the right medication and i can't get
[49:36] the right
[49:37] shot did i no no no no no come on god
[49:41] got a real shocked come on god got a
[49:45] pill hey man as i look on these uh
[49:49] uh hand sanitizers and they said it
[49:52] kills 99.9
[49:55] but come on we got something that kills
[49:57] a hundred
[49:59] come on these demons of sickness come on
[50:02] god don't do 99.9
[50:05] no he do a hundred percent
[50:08] god don't halfway deliver you but god
[50:11] gives you
[50:12] total deliverance oh yes
[50:16] i'm telling you uh i i don't know about
[50:19] you amen but but i
[50:20] feel we ought to be in revival mode not

[50:38] report

[50:42] back in that land
[50:43] or they said oh there are giants and
[50:46] there are walls and and them other two
[50:49] sat there and said
[50:50] come on what y'all looking at
[50:53] they're saying we're more than able to
[50:55] take it
[50:57] yes there are walls yes there is
[51:00] cropper 19 yes there's arthritis
[51:03] yes there's high blood pressure but we
[51:06] are more than able
[51:11] yeah i i feel a little crazy but it feel
[51:15] good
[51:17] yeah because i know whom i believe
[51:21] come on i realize this church that
[51:24] if we don't get up out of this
[51:27] rut that the devil is trying to put on
[51:30] us
[51:31] we'll just wither right out and die
[51:35] oh no but not god's church come on
[51:38] they may even fall but they'll get back
[51:41] up
[51:42] come on you might be down today but you
[51:45] got to fight
[51:46] your way through as our brother and god
[51:48] will say
[51:49] press my way through and the servant of
[51:52] god said
[51:53] you ain't gonna get nothing except you
[51:56] fight for it
[51:58] every itch or ground you get
[52:01] you are not going to get in a victory
[52:05] crying about it stop our crying
[52:10] get about your father business look at
[52:13] your
[52:13] situation and say you devil
[52:18] in the name of jesus i
[52:21] take authority over you
[52:24] yeah see the devil know you when you're
[52:26] playing or not
[52:28] yeah but we sit there and say i don't
[52:30] know whether it'll happen
[52:34] oh my i believe now we have seen too
[52:38] much
[52:40] we've heard too much about what
[52:43] god can do now it's time for us to see
[52:46] god do it
[52:48] the problem is when do you want him to
[52:51] do it
[52:53] you want to wait another epidemic hit
[52:56] come on we we got to understand that
[52:59] this ain't
[53:00] nothing here we realize it's going to
[53:03] get even
[53:03] worse than this the world is
[53:07] panicking they're shook up there just
[53:10] uh going all out with all kind of
[53:14] lies and dramas and stories and
[53:17] philosophies
[53:19] and no real answers
[53:22] but here god got the answer
[53:26] god said i got the remedy
[53:29] god said i gave you the best
[53:32] weapon there is they can ever have
[53:36] that is the word
[53:41] you know thinking about you know the
[53:42] opening of the book
[53:44] you know but when the book was became
[53:48] open the power came with it
[53:51] come on that was the restoration of the
[53:53] word
[53:55] god said i was gonna i'm gonna restore
[53:58] and saith the lord
[54:00] and when he restored the truth of the
[54:03] word
[54:04] back to the believers it brought a power
[54:07] with it
[54:09] the same power that the early church had
[54:12] in the book of acts come on that
[54:15] church and the servant of god said we
[54:17] are the continuation
[54:20] of the early church of the book of acts
[54:23] church
[54:24] he said that acts church was a church
[54:28] that moved in power
[54:32] he said all else is false
[54:36] he said mark 16 let's read it let's go
[54:39] ahead and read it
[54:40] i know y'all know it
[54:44] sometimes i wonder as we read as things
[54:48] that we hear it so much
[54:50] but it has a clicked
[54:53] see the word has to be a quicken
[54:58] we need the holy ghost to quicken
[55:02] the word we need a revelation
[55:07] that's why the servant of god said
[55:09] revelation to the true
[55:10] church means more to you than what you
[55:13] think
[55:15] because if not we just have letter
[55:19] we have a lot of information that was
[55:22] stored up but what are we doing with it
[55:27] what is it doing in our lives
[55:31] the word oughta have preeminence
[55:34] the word is quick it's powerful
[55:38] it's sharp that a two-edged sword
[55:41] it's a discerner it goes down to the
[55:45] deep part of our thoughts it
[55:48] root out amen the powers of the devil
[55:52] is beholding us captivity and it
[55:55] sets us free oh my
[56:00] lord have mercy
[56:03] mark 16
[56:06] servant of god said the last commission
[56:12] that god
[56:16] gave to the church
[56:22] 16 and 15 said he said unto them
[56:26] go ye into all the world
[56:30] and preach the gospel
[56:33] in other words to demonstrate it
[56:38] that's what we need not just a letter of
[56:42] it
[56:44] but we need the demonstration of it
[56:50] you know we witness the people about
[56:53] how good god is and what he's
[56:56] able to do
[57:00] and you uh sometimes even forget the
[57:03] television that
[57:04] my god can deliver out of every
[57:07] situation
[57:09] no no no there ain't no limit
[57:13] don't limit god to to to
[57:16] your standard take your limitation
[57:20] off of god and let god get loose
[57:24] let your faith loose and say god
[57:27] whatever that you doing in the season
[57:30] lord
[57:31] don't do it without me
[57:36] oh yeah but the enemy have us
[57:39] looking at what's going on in america
[57:43] oh how many cases
[57:46] they're going up and they're going up
[57:49] and they're going
[57:50] up but you failed to see how good god is
[57:56] you failed to see how god uh uh
[57:59] he didn't camp his angels about you
[58:03] come on god amen got his angel dispersed
[58:07] amen and won't let things go uh
[58:10] come to you and if he does allow it then
[58:13] god
[58:13] say i'm still the healer come on you
[58:17] might get sick but
[58:19] then you would know that god is still a
[58:21] healer
[58:22] yes he heals me god want to give you a
[58:26] testimony that
[58:27] where you can run and tell somebody
[58:30] there ain't
[58:30] nothing too hard for god to
[58:35] oh do that's why we don't have to panic
[58:39] and
[58:39] get all worried up you know about what's
[58:42] going on
[58:43] yes this thing is very deadly but
[58:47] come on god is our keeper
[58:50] god promised i'll keep you in the day of
[58:54] temptation
[58:56] i'll keep you in the darkness of the
[58:59] hours
[59:00] upon the earth i'll be your light
[59:04] come on when the whole world is going to
[59:07] gross darkness and
[59:09] and and earthquakes and storms and
[59:12] everything just seem to be coming from
[59:15] all
[59:15] over you know the place in in the
[59:18] economy
[59:20] is broke i mean there is such a
[59:23] turmoil that with money and how to get
[59:27] it
[59:27] back running again and we sitting here
[59:30] threatening about what
[59:35] that's why we got to understand the word
[59:37] didn't profit them because it wasn't
[59:39] mixed with faith
[59:42] i believe the bible said when the son of
[59:44] man cometh
[59:46] shall he find what faith
[59:50] on the earth see
[59:53] i believe paulden was saying that
[59:55] contend
[59:57] for the faith
[1:00:01] see this uh a church that god had
[1:00:04] called she's a church that's gonna
[1:00:08] uh walk and live by faith
[1:00:13] her faith is going to cause her to do
[1:00:16] exploits
[1:00:20] that's the church faith i saw something
[1:00:23] earlier
[1:00:24] peter but i'm not going to read that let
[1:00:25] me finish this here
[1:00:27] in mark it's like mark 16 fish reading
[1:00:30] it
[1:00:33] it said to them go into all the world
[1:00:36] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:00:40] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:00:43] be saved but he that believeth not
[1:00:45] shall be damned and these signs
[1:00:48] shall follow them that believe
[1:00:52] you know so many times even around the
[1:00:54] message
[1:00:55] they want to downplay that these things
[1:00:59] ought to be
[1:00:59] operating in our lab because they said
[1:01:02] that's pentecostal
[1:01:05] yeah pentecost it's pentecostals all
[1:01:07] right it's pentecostal experience
[1:01:11] god never took those things away from
[1:01:13] the church
[1:01:16] but because a lot of times that day
[1:01:18] don't
[1:01:19] i can't produce it or because it's not
[1:01:22] activating in their life then they say
[1:01:24] well we got the perfect word now so we
[1:01:27] don't need those things
[1:01:30] yes the word just brought uh
[1:01:34] us back to god and uh give us the
[1:01:36] understanding
[1:01:37] how to use these things correctly
[1:01:40] and to place it in order that these
[1:01:43] things
[1:01:44] ought to be operating not just in the
[1:01:47] preacher lives
[1:01:48] because it says here to him that what
[1:01:51] believeth
[1:01:52] how many believers we got
[1:01:55] if you are a believer then these things
[1:01:58] here
[1:01:58] are part of your promise
[1:02:02] it should be a part of your christian
[1:02:05] life
[1:02:07] not to wait to somebody else do it you
[1:02:10] do it
[1:02:11] see too many times we we're laying
[1:02:14] waiting on somebody else
[1:02:16] but activate your faith
[1:02:19] you know the more you begin to activate
[1:02:22] what you believe then god got something
[1:02:25] to work with
[1:02:30] oh my
[1:02:35] he said the 17 indeed signs shall
[1:02:38] follow them
[1:02:43] that believe in my name shall it cast
[1:02:46] out devils
[1:02:48] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:02:50] should take up serpents
[1:02:52] if they drink any deadly thing
[1:02:56] it shall not hurt them
[1:02:59] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:03:02] they shall
[1:03:03] recover so then after the lord has
[1:03:07] spoken unto them
[1:03:09] he will receive up into heaven and set
[1:03:11] on the right hand of god
[1:03:13] and they went forth and preached
[1:03:16] everywhere
[1:03:17] the lord working with them
[1:03:21] income what confirming the word
[1:03:24] with signs following see
[1:03:28] god set them even out
[1:03:31] amen and god they went everywhere
[1:03:36] preaching the gospel and the law
[1:03:39] was confirming what
[1:03:42] he said see god
[1:03:46] confirmed the word because he the one
[1:03:50] gave
[1:03:50] it but they had to believe the word
[1:03:56] and they believed it and went out
[1:03:58] preaching it
[1:03:59] and god was working with them confirming
[1:04:03] the word
[1:04:04] and signs and one to follow them
[1:04:07] i wonder sometimes what's wrong with the
[1:04:10] church
[1:04:12] the bride's so-called say the the people
[1:04:16] that
[1:04:17] call themselves uh
[1:04:20] in the message
[1:04:23] yes plenty of them from plenty of letter
[1:04:27] oh plenty of good sermons plenty of deep
[1:04:30] mysteries
[1:04:31] plenty of uh tying in the loose
[1:04:34] ends and all of those things but where
[1:04:38] is the power of the word
[1:04:42] where is god confirming
[1:04:45] the word with signs and oneness
[1:04:49] come on because the word should have the
[1:04:51] same effect
[1:04:53] as it did back then it should be doing
[1:04:56] the same thing
[1:04:58] right now not just
[1:05:01] uh something we are saying and then
[1:05:03] nothing happens
[1:05:06] come on the word of god wants to move
[1:05:09] down in
[1:05:09] each and every one of our lives
[1:05:12] i'm going to read something
[1:05:16] i might already quoted it but let me
[1:05:18] just read it anyhow
[1:05:20] first thessalonians
[1:05:29] you know if god can just only get
[1:05:32] somebody
[1:05:35] brother keith said i wish somebody sold
[1:05:38] wood
[1:05:43] catch on fire amen that's what
[1:05:46] we need we need fire
[1:05:50] we need the dynamics
[1:05:54] not just the mechanics
[1:05:57] first that's going on
[1:06:14] one in five
[1:06:19] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[1:06:23] only
[1:06:25] but also in what power
[1:06:29] and in the holy ghost any much as shown
[1:06:34] as you know what man of men we were
[1:06:36] among you
[1:06:38] and ye became followers of us and of the
[1:06:41] lord have received the word in much
[1:06:43] affliction
[1:06:44] with joy of the holy ghost see
[1:06:49] paul said it came not in word only
[1:06:54] but in power and demonstration of the
[1:06:57] holy ghost
[1:07:02] servant of god said here
[1:07:06] when he sent his disciples out
[1:07:11] he told them healed the sick cleanse the
[1:07:13] leper raise the dead
[1:07:15] freely as we receive freely give
[1:07:18] he said that was his first commission
[1:07:21] matthew 10 in mark
[1:07:23] 16 last question he said go into all the
[1:07:26] world and preach the gospel
[1:07:28] he that believed in the baptist i
[1:07:29] already quoted that in my name
[1:07:32] he said what's the matter is we
[1:07:35] christians get too weak when it comes to
[1:07:39] the showdown
[1:07:43] when it comes to us applying what we've
[1:07:45] heard
[1:07:47] it when it comes time for us acting
[1:07:49] every on what we have heard
[1:07:52] then we begin to want to back down off
[1:07:54] of it
[1:07:56] when sickness come upon you or when
[1:07:58] something happens
[1:08:00] i mean even your home you got to
[1:08:02] understand
[1:08:03] that's the time for you to activate the
[1:08:06] word in your own life
[1:08:09] come on it'll do us no good it it'll be
[1:08:12] just like
[1:08:13] it was them it did not profit
[1:08:16] them not being mixed with
[1:08:19] faith faith
[1:08:24] activates the word
[1:08:27] because god said so
[1:08:30] that's why abraham uh could believe god
[1:08:33] like he did
[1:08:35] uh it said that abraham got stronger
[1:08:40] in faith don't tarry
[1:08:43] he wait for it he knew that
[1:08:47] it was impossible for god to tell a lie
[1:08:52] do it might tear it to you amen
[1:08:55] you got to understand that it got to
[1:08:59] happen
[1:09:02] because god said so
[1:09:05] that's the kind of church we ought to be
[1:09:08] that's the kind of people amen that we
[1:09:11] ought to be
[1:09:13] a people that's gonna not just
[1:09:16] uh are taken as a social a word but
[1:09:20] take it as as something that you
[1:09:23] know that what god's saying he's
[1:09:26] able to do it and he want to do it
[1:09:29] through
[1:09:30] you you are the one that the promises of
[1:09:34] god
[1:09:34] has been given to amen
[1:09:38] let's take god in his word tonight
[1:09:41] god bless you
[1:09:48] thank you jesus amen god is good
[1:09:52] appreciate the word today amen the power
[1:09:56] of the gospel the gospel has power
[1:10:00] to heal to deliver to set free
[1:10:04] we thank god for brother palmer
[1:10:07] the bible said the word didn't come with
[1:10:10] in word only but in power
[1:10:14] and demonstration and god is always
[1:10:17] identified by his own characteristics
[1:10:20] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:10:22] and forever
[1:10:24] what he did then if he's jesus in you
[1:10:29] than what he was
[1:10:32] when he walked on the earth over 2 000
[1:10:35] years ago
[1:10:37] that same jesus if he's in you he'll be
[1:10:40] identified by his own characteristics
[1:10:44] he said the works that i do shall you do
[1:10:47] also
[1:10:48] and greater works in these shall you do
[1:10:51] amen it's just whether or not
[1:10:55] we recognize who's in us and because we
[1:10:58] recognize
[1:11:00] who's in us then god is able to do
[1:11:03] the greater works but we have to allow
[1:11:07] him to do it
[1:11:09] because if we get in the way we
[1:11:10] interfere with what god is doing
[1:11:13] we don't want to interfere with the what
[1:11:15] the lord
[1:11:16] want to do in our lives because we
[1:11:19] realize we can do nothing
[1:11:21] he said without me you can do nothing so
[1:11:24] it takes god doing the work
[1:11:27] amen the bible says we are his
[1:11:29] workmanship created in christ jesus
[1:11:32] so it's him that worketh in us both the
[1:11:35] will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:11:37] it's not what we can do it's what god is
[1:11:39] doing
[1:11:40] amen so as we can get ourselves out the
[1:11:44] way
[1:11:45] we can allow the spirit of god to
[1:11:48] achieve and accomplish what god
[1:11:50] has promised in his word to do in this
[1:11:53] day
[1:11:53] and how we live in so we can look to the
[1:11:57] promises of god and say god
[1:11:59] you promise amen and you
[1:12:03] hold god to his promise you say god this
[1:12:05] is what you promised
[1:12:07] and we know that god cannot lie and all
[1:12:10] we got to do is stand on the promises of
[1:12:12] god
[1:12:14] and knowing that the promises that god
[1:12:15] has come to pass
[1:12:17] we got to have patient enough to wait
[1:12:20] and trust god to bring it to pass in our
[1:12:22] lives
[1:12:24] if he said with the stripes we heal
[1:12:27] amen then god don't go back on his word
[1:12:31] but god gave us his word if he tells you
[1:12:34] with his stripes you're healed
[1:12:37] then we got to stand on the promises of
[1:12:39] god and say god
[1:12:40] you said it lord and you keep your word
[1:12:44] i know i can depend on god's word and we
[1:12:47] can't depend on god's word
[1:12:48] what word we're going to depend on who
[1:12:52] amen if we can't trust what god said and
[1:12:54] his word
[1:12:55] said who we're going to depend on who
[1:12:57] we're going to trust in
[1:12:59] amen so what happens what we
[1:13:03] we that believe god's word we
[1:13:06] act on god's word that's why we're here
[1:13:09] tonight
[1:13:10] he said when two or three are gathered
[1:13:12] in my name he said forsake not
[1:13:14] disassembling yourself together isn't
[1:13:15] that right
[1:13:16] so we're acting on what god's word said
[1:13:19] now we got to know amen whatever we can
[1:13:22] do for the lord
[1:13:24] time is short and the time is at hand
[1:13:27] they meant when god reckoned
[1:13:29] with you in that day you're going to say
[1:13:32] what did i do with the life or what did
[1:13:35] i do with the word and the promises that
[1:13:37] god gave me
[1:13:39] what did i do with it did i just sit on
[1:13:42] it did i put it on the bush
[1:13:45] you're going to be responsible amen
[1:13:49] for what god has given you any place in
[1:13:52] your hand
[1:13:53] so brother and sister let's get about
[1:13:56] our father's business
[1:13:58] because god has chosen you for a purpose
[1:14:01] as soon as you find out what the purpose
