matthew by god's grace matthew 6 god is good amen just want to minister tonight on a little something that started on this past weekend matthew 6 and 19. you got to say amen and it reads lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth where moth and dust do corrupt and where thieves break through the steel but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where neither moth nor rust nor dove door nor moth nor rust does corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steel you may be seated we want to continue on it says for where your treasure is there there will your heart be also the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine i be single thy whole body is full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body is full of darkness if therefore the dark if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness no man can serve two masters for he will either hate one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve god amen therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink know yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body more than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his statue and why take ye thought for raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they told not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you and even solomon and all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothes the grass of the field which is which today is and tomorrow is cast unto heaven and i mean into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or whether all with whether with all shall we be clothed for after these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you therefore take no thought for the moral the moral shall take thought for itself for the things of itself sufficient until the day is the evil thereof may god bless you reading of his word again tonight by god's grace i want to minister to you for a moment and i entitled it just something i just just started dealing with on this past weekend i entitled it to masters amen two masters you know taking it here from the 24th verse and how jesus was was crying out to the people and even to us today he says that no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other come on i said you know just meditating on the word i i said that's a strong word he said you can't serve two masters he said you're gonna hate one and you're gonna love the other you say i love god but i love the world come on he said you're gonna hate one and you're gonna love the other so we're talking tonight about two masters you know i was thinking i said the problem that we're faced with today you know is no different than the problems that the other generations were faced with and one of that one of those problems is that you know the people uh they want to be in the church they desire to be in the church and in the world at the same time you know i think about how paul talked about it as some somewhat uh a battle a war he says with with my mind you know with my spirit i want to serve god he said but with my flesh you know it's wanting to serve sin come on but you can't serve two masters you're gonna love one or you're gonna hate the other so we find that like we said the battle that we see in uh uh or the things we see in aroused today is no different than what all the other generations had to face with you know the people want to i said being on the world and in the church at church and in the world at the same time i said like this they want to have enough religion as we say to satisfy god so they think because you know it's no such thing as that but sometimes we want to have enough religion just to satisfy god and then yet we still want to at times step out the gates in and enjoy the pleasures as they say of sin come on but jesus like i said was crying out to him he said you can't serve two masters you're gonna love morning you're gonna hate the other come on so we find that even when he he began to cry out to this age of the laodicean church he began to say that he says i find that you lukewarm you ain't cold no you're hot he said but you lukewarm he said i would that you would rather be cold or hot come on cause you can't serve two masters yeah i rather you either be in or out he says but but since you you're in between he says that you know i'ma spew you out of my mouth so we find that a lot of times our actions make god sick we can say it like that our actions it does something to god to way he says i want to spew you out of my mouth come on but i said lord uh it's time that we revisit our our uh i believe uh salvation or revisit our commitment to god i think about david and how david he began to say all the days of my life will i serve you lord come on so i said lord sometimes and many of times in our christian journey we got to revisit our commitment that we made that commitment that we made when we were desperate when we were in need when god was our only answer when he was our only hope when he was our only savior and we needed help we said lord if you come help me out of this situation i'll never go back lord i serve you all the days of my life that's the commitment that we made come on and god came didn't he because the thing about it is god is faithful he's more faithful than you and i uh brother and sister god is faithful god is there we always say lord i praise you through the good and the bad come on but when those things come upon our lives sometimes we lose our faith sometimes we go back on our stance on god why because we were just singing a song or or just making a statement but god is faithful when god told us that he'd be there with us through the good of the bad god meant in every word that he said god won't walk away from us in our lowest points i think about the the footprints on the sand the time he said lord in my in my darkest time and my heart is trials and life i only saw one set of footprints he said my child that's the time i was carrying you you thought god left you but god didn't leave you god was there with you through the good and the bad come on whether you was happy or sad god was still there encouraging you telling you to get up and fight come on letting you know that i'll never leave you nor forsake you the whole world might be against you but i'm still in your corner you still got to fight in you come on you still got to press in you god gave you something to give you enough to encourage you to carry on didn't he made me think about gideon and how he said if the lord be with us come on if god be with us where all his miracles come on but the thing about it is god never left them come on god said i'm still here and i got my miracles with me come on and my power is still the same and that's what it is sometimes we get in that place god if you be with us then where are you come on but i'm to the place now where i said lord i'm gonna believe you god no matter what i'm gonna have faith in you and i won't waver you know i i like how hearing the scriptures how jesus uh uh and in in the scriptures here our reading he kept saying take no thought come on don't don't even worry about that why because he's already got it all in control he said don't take no thought he said it maybe four or five times therefore take no thought what is he saying i want you just to trust me and god gets us to those places to where we can only have one one answer or one one uh uh like they say jesus is the answer for the world today we only got one way of escape and that way of escape is him and i'm so glad that he is the way of escape because he never failed and he never will fail brothers and sisters he never will so i thank god tonight but i want to like i said talk to you about like he was saying here about two masters come on he says you can't learn you can't you can't have two you can't have but one and he said you're gonna love one and you're gonna hate the other but we find that you know that what he says that's what's going uh uh with what's happening today people wanna uh give have enough just just a little to say they got religion but like we said they want to step outside of the gates come on i like how in one example how jesus when he was dealing with the with the young rich ruler and you know he began to just paraphrasing and talking to the young rich ruler and the young rich ruler said good master he said what must i do you know to be saved and jesus began to talk to him about uh the ten commandments and you know i was beginning to say i says he talked to him about having good religion come on and and the rich ruler young rich rule says that i kept all these things from my youth but yet it was something down on the deep on the inside of him that he knew something was missing and how many times uh uh individuals we ourselves we know that it's something missing come on it's something missing out of my life it's something that i need more of come on i i know that i go to church i got good religion but i'm missing something i'm missing the power i'm missing the anointing i'm missing i'm trying to live right but i'm missing the one that can help me live right come on he knew that it was something that he was missing and jesus began to talk to him he says okay i want you to go and sell uh what you got and i want you to give it to the poor come on he said all these things and then it to the young witch ruler that was hard he couldn't do those things but then the bible said that i like how it says that jesus loved him come on and i want to say tonight jesus loves you and i he desires that all be saved that's why he came and died for the sins of the whole world he loves you but he knows that you can't have two masters he knows that the only way you're going to get the benefits from god is you got to forsake the whole world come on not some of the world but the whole world you got to give up everything you got to let go and let god have its way in your life you got to let god be god in your life you got to say god whatever it is you want me to give up god i'm gonna give it all up lord because god knows like he says he says uh jesus loved him come on he knew that he said you can't he says here you can't serve two masters he knew that you know money or riches was a problem for this young man so he wanted to help that young man eat to move that stumbling block out of your way but the young man couldn't let those things go said that he walked away you know uh sorrowful come on but i think about that even in our lives jesus knows what's holding you back from getting what you need from him god knows what's keeping you from the from the new birth come on he knows you know you might had a touch of the holy ghost just a a little bit on your flesh in your spirit but i say tonight god wants to fill you up come on god you we sing the song lord fill me up god wants to fill you up he wants your cup to run over but sometimes it's stuff in our way and he said i can't have two masters come on i need you to let go and let me be the master in your life i want to say tonight god is a good master god is one that's gonna be able to take care of you he said look at those birds of the air he says they don't put in the barns and all these things and he says your heavenly father take care of them that god gone he provides for them and he says if he does those things for them what about you and i it did something to my soul to know that god has got it all in control as we say god he's going to provide all your needs he said just let me be the master in your life trust me with the things that you don't think that i'm able to handle and god will show you with the things you've been facing with put them in god's hands the things you've been battling with let god fight all your battles come on give it to god and watch god take care of it it'll be just like it wasn't nothing but a moment all your suffering trial and tribulation it ain't be to be compared with the glory that god wanted to reveal in you and i and the things that he got stored up for us but we got to let go come on i says i i says in the last sermon i was saying that you know paul was talking about he was saying don't come short of it come on he was saying our fear he was saying let us let us come on press on let us go on into he says because i fear lest any of us come short of it talking about you know going into the land as we said israel is going to a natural land but they were going we're looking at us going into a spiritual land come on he says i don't want you to fall short of it like they did come on so we finding that even today let's don't fall short of it and we we come to that place in time you know as we were talking about are we staying tonight serving two masters i think about it you know in this life you know it says you know in this life it's only three things the the the pleasures uh uh i mean the let's look at it first john two so i don't wanna mess it all up first john two amen god is good amen two masters he said you can't serve too he said you'll even you'll either love one and hate the other first john 2 and 15. let's begin at the sixth sixteenth verse he says for all that is in the world like we said it what what is what is this life life about it says for all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of the life and the pride of life is not is not of the father but is of the world they said that's all the things that is in this world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and that's it come on and he says that you know these things but he says here in the 15th verse he was saying love not the world neither the things that are in the world he says if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in them come on he wants uh like he says he wants a total separation not only did he said don't love the world he said but don't love the things that are in the world he said because if you love those things he said the love of the father is not in you but we're talking about i always say it's two masters we find that many times today i says that you know you know we look at people as individuals want to be in in in the world and out of the world at the same time in the church and not in in the world at the same time and i said it's not it's not so much that a individual love god that that they want to i guess serve them or please them but a lot of times you know they know that they're in need of his power they know that that they're in need of him so they can't let him go completely but because then they know that it's gonna come sometimes where they're gonna have to cry out jesus and they're gonna need them to be there so you know it's a lot of times we we we feel that way what it is is trickery of the devil to make us believe that all the time you can be in and out and you can call on god and he'll always show up but maybe it'll be a time when you call on the lord and he won't be able to be found i think about samson and how he played just long enough he was in and out in and out come on but you can't serve two masters but when he came to the time where he he needed help he said i'll go shake myself he could look to the covenant that god made him as other times but it was a time when he went to shake himself and he didn't realize that the bible says he didn't know that god wasn't with him come on he didn't know that but so we find that even in our lives today don't let don't let the devil deceive you come on don't be not deceived like this the bible says god is not mocked whatever a man so that's what he gonna reap come on so we wanna what do we wanna do we wanna sow the good things of god we to show the right fruits fruits that'll bring forth repentance fruits that'll bring forth a man or a sister or daughter a humbleness one that'll walk before god saying lord i am all that i am only because of what you made me one that got pleasing god on their mind from the time they get up to the time they lay down in the evening i was laying in the bed the other day and i was i was just meditating on myself i said lord it ain't just about preaching it ain't just about being popular all these things i said god but i need a word from you lord i need something that's gonna when it's gonna reach down into the hearts of the people that's gonna uproot sin that's gonna uproot unbelief and all these things and get somebody some help lord that's what i need i said god if you need somebody to cry loud and spare not let me be the one god don't let me be ashamed of the testimony of jesus christ hallelujah why because i know it's good for your soul i know it'll help you in a time when you need help i know that god he ain't doing nothing but what he what something to help you i know that why god does that he beats us up a lot of time not beats us up but he chastises us why because he's a good father come on we're saying that song he's a good good father a good good father chastises his children he lets them know where they're wrong then he uplifts them where they're right but he does it all for the good how many believe that tonight and i thank god for that but that's what it is i said lord you know i says the more the closer we get uh uh even now to the end we got to be just that more like god come on he says when when we'll see him we'll be like him come on i believe we're going to be like them before we get off of this earth but not just you say we're caught up but you got to it's now you and christ becoming one that your mind you uh that are adopting a gain in the mind of christ and the mind of christ would be that like we said when you wake up in the morning lord i want to be pleasing to you help me lord that when i walk the day lord let my walking be pleasing to you whatever i say whatever i do god let it be pleasing to you whatever you want me to do god whatever you want me to say god wherever you want me to be god help me lord that i might be in your will come on i was sharing with somebody at work i said the thing about it is uh you we got to be conscious conscious that we want to be right with god at all times is that because at any time any moment things could turn and i was thinking about the little episode i had the other day and how i felt all right and then all of a sudden things just happened and i just didn't know what took place and i said you know just meditating on those things i said that's how how quickly your life could be gone that's how quickly your breath of life can be taken out of your body or things can turn for the worse and you don't have time to even get on on your knees you don't even have time to lift up your hands and say cry father forgive me you don't even have time but the best thing to do is while you got the breath of life right now while the blood is running warm in your veins right now wow you can lift your hands right now lift your hands and say thank you jesus give god all you got right now why because in the next moment it could be your time the answer to god for the things that you committed in your life hallelujah it becomes real god let things happen in your life unless you see that you need me more than you think come on you need me in the morning you need me in the evening you need me when you're walking on your job you need me all the day long hallelujah and god wants to be with you all the day long hallelujah but we find that i was sharing with someone that today i said the thing is uh it says you can't serve two masters i heard somebody make an absurd statement the other day and i said that's what it is that's what it did that's how the devil has deceived people that they come to that place to where like like the scripture says that they know that the people that commit these sins are worthy of death not only are they worthy of death that they know these things but they have pleasure in doing them come on the bible call them reprobate a time in a world even that we live in today would reach that such state of mind chaos with people like says completely lost their minds and they have pleasure at it come on they have pleasure in these things but you and i god has kept our minds and our mind still is to do what our pleasure still comes from what serving the lord our pleasure still comes from praising god and giving god everything that belongs to him and that's the our whole mind body and soul how many believe that tonight but we find that he says you can't you can't serve two masters you know like i said it's not so much that that the people wouldn't love god but it seems so much that they i mean wouldn't wouldn't um would love god it's just so much that they know they wouldn't be in need of his power you know i was thinking about how how uh israel was throughout the scriptures and how you know the bible when they begin to cry out to samuel give us a king we all know the story how he says god it says give us a king and and the thing is they even confess from their own mouth that samuel you didn't you didn't never do us no wrong yes god has always used you god has always been there for us we don't want you to completely go away but they says that we want to be like all the other nations come on but i want to say tonight you can't have two masters you're going to love one or you're going to hate the other they want god like they said because they know they need them for its power but we want to be like the world at the same time but we find out even what what what what happened to israel you know they found out when they got they man when they got the king just like as the as the world they got to be like the other world they found out that they couldn't serve the lord as they ought to why because you can't serve two masters you got to do the king's bidding come on but i thank god even here tonight that looking at it i says what it is we got so many cloud of witnesses we got so many warnings so many buffers of things that that come that we can see and hear and know even not only then but in our lifetime to know that you know you can't serve two sooner or later uh you're gonna you're gonna go to either one side or the other but we find that i want to say tonight why not serve the lord come on why not let god be your master isn't he good to you hasn't he been good to you why not serve him come on i remember uh pastor saying once he says he was saying is is god that bad to you and it's the devil that good to you come on but i want to say tonight god is good all the time how many believe that but we find that i says the thing is he he was he was looking here let's look back at matthew 6 by god's grace it won't be long just like i said just something i just starting on and and it's just things that just grip my heart matthew six and like he says you can't serve you know god and ma'am in the world so we know that you know when he's talking about here jesus when he was talking about these two masters there's something uh that he kept attacking first and one of the things he was attacking was was treasures and riches the riches come on money and and we can say uh today he was he was attacking certain uh uh things he and then he kept on uh uh hitting on these things he was saying in in the 19th verse he was saying lay not up for yourself treasures on your on on this earth but he said in the 20 verse but lay up yourself treasures in heaven he says where nor do nor moth where we're neither moth nor rust they'll corrupt and thieves do not break through the steel but in the 20th verse he says for where your treasure is there uh uh there will your heart be also when he was talking about you know uh these two masters a lot of what he was uh attacking was riches come on which riches and and worldly gain possession and all these things because he was attacking these things because he knew that there were so many that were led astray by these things you know money we think about how how how powerful spirit money has on it come on i think about even judas for him to sell his master for 20 pieces of silver come on a 30 piece of silver for him to sell as a master come on the brothers sold their brother joseph for so many pieces of silver a lot of people did a lot of corrupt things for behind money that we can see and it led them the the the love of money come on it's the root of all evil the bible says it led led to a place uh led people to some dark places led people to do things that they thought they would have never done led people they end up in places that it would have been better off that they would have never even seen or even heard or thought of having certain riches of old things because they were better off but we find that and that's what jesus here began attacking now you might say uh uh money isn't my problem but i just want to say this is one of the things that even jesus was attacking it may not be money but whatever your problem is you can't serve two masters you can only you can't have but one at the time but jesus here laying these things out jesus talking about the treasures and and how you know a man in in the riches and all these things but he began to take the people and take you in our minds to get off of living of the things that we see and the material things and start leaning to the eyes of faith of looking to the unseen he began to tell them that's why we were saying he was saying take no thought come on take no thought he says i'm gonna provide for you he says i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna meet all your needs come on i'm not only gonna do that but he gonna heal you come on he gonna he's gonna be he be your healer he's gonna be the one there for you all the time so he wants to he wants wanting to get the people mined away from all these things now which says you can't we're not asking you to be fanatical and live in a fanatical way because we know that you got we got to do certain things just to maintain but when it becomes of the first thing to you that's when it becomes sin that's when it becomes a master to you he says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven come on seek you first the kingdom of god you got to seek god first in all of you all of your achievements and the things that you're trying to achieve in life all of your goals and ambitions you got to have god in the first of it you got to have god lord no matter what comes no matter what goes god i want you to be first in my life god i want you to be pleased first come on and then once you seek god first and your your desire and your will is to do the will of god then watch all these things to be added why because god and he'll bless you he know that you'll know how to handle the blessings that he want to give you many times god don't give us the blessings that we want right away because he know that it might destroy you it might kill you so sometimes god waits and he lets and he does things to build up character in us the way we get to the place that we realize that this earth ain't our home but we can profess like abraham that we're searching for a city who's building maker ain't god we ain't from here this ain't our permanent dwelling place but we're looking from the city that god has built we're looking for god to come back and take us again on high how many looking for that tonight so we look it says what it is he says don't don't lay up all these things and i like how how he was saying he was saying uh uh seek you first but he was uh here and he was well he but we find that he was talking about like we said you're talking about treasures come on you can't have two masters he was talking about uh uh you got you can you're gonna love one and you're gonna hate the other sooner or later things are gonna trip you up what am i trying to do tonight what is jesus trying to do get our eyes single to look to him and him alone get our eyes single to get our eyes away from the things of what we see and and like we say us through the eyes of faith look to him because he don't want when he comes i was sharing with someone the other day i says and we was reading in the scriptures how how the people they were saying let us return unto the lord and he'll heal us and god's response to the people was he says when i we says when i would have healed you i found iniquity in you then he began talking about a time he says when i came to heal you i would have healed you but i couldn't heal you because you had things in your life that wasn't right you had things in your life that you needed to set your house in order so we had to deal with those things first before i could bring healing in your life and many times god want to do things in our life is our house in order do we have those things right i said god let my house be in order let me be walking that straight in that narrow way lord that when you come to heal me i won't miss my time of visitation many missed the time of visitation many missed their time god he said when i came to heal you i found iniquity in you come on but we thank the lord tonight who says you can't serve two masters he says you're gonna you're gonna love one and you or you're gonna hate the other i says you know god is so good to us come on the bible talk about a time where it'll be seven i think women it says that they'll go out to one man it says you know in one place that they want to dress themselves and call be called by your name but they want to address themselves in their own apparel they're on the door and on a door in apparel but god wants you to be clothed and he gives you the clothing to be clothed with and that is the word how many believe that tonight but i want to say you can't serve two masters you think about that he said you're gonna love one and you're gonna hate the elder i said god what it is i don't wanna despise you lord but lord i want to love you with all of my heart amen praise the lord amen we thank the lord for the word today thank the lord for uh brother ernest shared with us today you cannot serve two masters amen you can only love one and hate the other so by the grace of god as you look at the reality of that i thought about as he was speaking you cannot walk in the spirit and walk in the flesh at the same time so by the grace of god the bible said they are led by the spirit of god they're the sons of god so you cannot serve two masters but we we must understand that when we're children sons and daughters of god and being son and daughter of god then god leads us by his spirit we know that in order to become a son of god then we must be born again and when we are born again by one spirit are you baptized into one body and the holy ghost come crying out of our father but a lot of time many christians don't understand who the holy ghost is they said i got it oftentimes people seek for the power and for the fire a lot of times when people speak of the holy ghost they think about the power that the holy ghost has a lot of times you can look at an individual that can be strong and powerful or very very intelligent uh you can look at certain attributes of a person but the attributes is not the fullness of the person so i'm saying to you the holy ghost is jesus the holy ghost is a person and a person of jesus christ when he comes down inside of you you got to realize that he is a person he's not a thing he's not just power a lot of times we pray for more power we want to get stronger but we got to realize all the strength that we need is in the person if we have him we got the power we got the strength but failure to recognize who he is that he is a person he is christ he said hobbit when he the spirit of truth is come he where is he that's in you the person if you have jesus you have access to everything he has so much and so the prophet god oftentimes said all that god was he put it into christ and all that christ was he pulled it into the church so if you have all that he had because you got the person christ is in you the hope of glory now he only can express himself through you when you can recognize who he is see the next time we try to do something or behave ourselves unseemly we got to realize that the person christ that's in you i think somebody said grieve not the holy spirit whereby you're still unto the day of redemption the very person in you can be grieved because he is a person god can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity the bible says jesus got the loudest grave and jesus well sometimes the condition of mankind is so wicked to god said it repented me he was touched because of the condition how about you and i the person that we carry around with us is just like a mother with a pregnant with a child amen and you and i are pregnant with the word amen and we're to bring forth jesus christ are you with me the very person the very god brother and sister it's time that we recognize and we'll not conduct our lives and don't we not amen that he don't exist christians save folk holy ghosts field folks oftentimes conduct their lives and things that they do the way that they act as though that person is not a person he's not a he's just a power just a stretch but he's a person [Music] we don't want to do things to cause our parents to be disappointed in us how about our heavenly father you said i wouldn't do that in front of mama i wouldn't do that in front of daddy what how about the god that's inside of you you're doing that in front of him are you with me so brother and sister let's get a hold amen who jesus is say he said to peter who do you say that i am if he's a person then that person if he's in you i'll tell you brother says this is real to me can't serve two masters the bible said we ought to take jesus with us everywhere we go everywhere we go and we do as a christian we do he's with us everywhere we go when you wake up in the morning and when you're laid out at night you ought to take the lord everywhere you go god bless you now realizing that we must yield ourselves in such a way the very light from the sun the moon is reflected in the light of the sun and the church is reflecting the light of the son of god are you with me you must be a reflection of the light not your own light but the light that you get from the sun are you with me don't let it the light go out amen recognize who's who you are and who's in you amen god bless you tonight appreciate brother ernest let us bow father in the name of jesus christ what a wonderful time to be a christian dangerous and perilous times has come but we ain't a wonderful time a time where we can praise you time when we say thank you but there are those that don't have the person of jesus christ in their lives those that are indeed of you lord [Music] maybe that many sudden here just have spiritual amnesia [Music] one time they realized that it was just not a thing inside of us there was not an it but it was christ and we didn't want to do anything that would displease him but lord help us now to be called back to repentance brother and sister why don't you repent tonight why don't you say lord i want to please you tonight lord i want to do your will lord lord it's you that i want to please i want you to lead me god may have have preeminence in my life brother and sister he is our master and i willingly become a slave to christ a prisoner lord have the preeminence have your way in my life oh do you want him to have his way why don't you just hear some lord have your way why don't you say lord i'm sorry i'm sorry for the way i've conducted my life the things that i've done because i didn't recognize your presence oh god i didn't recognize that you amen in your fullness now lord my eyes have been opened and i see you now lord and lord i don't want to disappoint you but i want to please you lord how many want to
