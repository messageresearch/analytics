the way Lord that we not be a hindrance to what you want to say Lord anything we said or done or thought and didn't please you Lord may you forgive us now help us and bless your word in Jesus name amen the book of uh Proverbs 3 praise God we don't know what the world is is going to do next but we know that God has all things in control three and one it says my son forget not my law but let thy heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not to thy own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path God bless you read word you may be seated it says in the seventh verse be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord it's getting some feedback from somewhere I don't know God bless oh that's it oh okay I was trying to understand where that was coming from amen therefore ver says it shall be heal to thy Naval and Marrow to thy bones honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy bonds be filled with plenty and thy press shall burst out with new wine we go back and to the fifth verse says trust in the Lord with what and lean not to what I like to just talk talk to you a little bit this morning by lean not to your own understanding because often times we see ourselves and if we got any kind of intelligence at all then we kind of trust in what we think how we think things ought to go as soon as a child reach you know teenage they they began to think that they understand a little about life sometimes they think the parents don't know what they know they don't understand the peer pressure and the things that they're going through so they kind of look and lean to their understanding of Life what we understand in the Book of Genesis genis the Bibles tell Eve and Adam not the touch of the tree of knowledge and good and evil but we understand that they chose their own understanding Eve chose reasoning over the word of God when God has spoken don't you touch it don't you eat unless you die you know when God says something to us it behooves us to believe what God Said but often times in in man since the days of Adam and Eve we were born in sin shaping an iniquity and it just behooves man at all the times to reason I I want to do it my way I I I I believe I know what's best for me I believe I know how to this is my life this is my life mama can't dictate to me Daddy can't dictate to me but this is my life you don't tell me how to live my life because it's mine y'all ever heard that before maybe we didn't say it just like that but that's what we meant this is my life if I make a mess of it then it's my mess but it's mine but the Bible tells us in Songs Know ye not that the Lord he is God it is he that made us and not we s are you with me so your life is only the life that God has given you so the the life that you think you are have a right to Amen to defame and to destroy it's only the life that God gave us are you with me so often times we take our life in our own hand and we have our own devices we do what we feel that we want to do with our lives I'm just going to do it my way I take my life in my own hand because it's mine it's mine it belong to me I can do what I want with it I can do good I can do evil I can do what I want it's mine nobody tells me how to live nobody tells me what what to do the kind of world we live in is what you want to be if you want to be a frog everybody says that's your business do what you want it's your thing you can do what you want so people choose to do all kind of all kind of what we call crazy stuff because it's theirs they they think they don't know at any moment at any time God said that's enough that is enough and God can cut you off like that aren't you glad that we serve a merciful god amen a God that can just speak just like when Jesus was here and and they decide to kill Jesus and Jesus said I got power to call 12 Legion of angels and you trying to uh take my life you know what I'm saying he said no man take my life I lay it down and I got the power to pick it up again amen God is G so I want to talk about lean not to your own understanding in Hebrews uh 11 and3 uh because uh often times we we look to our own understanding but but in Hebrews 11 and3 it says uh through faith we what through faith we understand without faith you don't understand but through faith we understand amen it takes you beli in the word faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of God we have to have faith in what God word says then we can understand we cannot understand God except we have faith we don't understand life amen we don't understand how to live we don't understand see because we lean to our own understanding I every man does what he think is right in his own eyes the Bible said uh there's a generation that are pure in their own eyes but yet they have not been washed from their filthiness are you with me see in our own eyes we do what we want to do it's in our own eyes I'm doing what I want to do because it's my life it's belong to me if I want to do this let me do it are you with me sad sad sad if God was looking down and made man in his own image and his own likeness and he looked at what go man is doing with the life that God gave him would you if you were God would you be pleased with this world in the condition that it was in would you look down upon man and you said everything is good Lord I'm I would he be pleased would you be pleased with the way people are are are living their lives what they are doing with their lives would you be pleased even you and yourself may look at your own self and you're not even pleased with the things that you might do are you with me you can say I do some stuff and I don't even know why I do it but I still do it why because I don't got I don't have power over what I do I do it Paul said the things I would not that I do and the things that I want to do I don't do he said I find then that there's a walk going on in my mind amen when I desire to do good evil is present with me are you with me so often times we we in ourselves want to do the right thing but it's beyond our power to do it are you with me in our ability we want to do it but we find ourselves wrestling I don't want to do this no more I want to do right I want to live right I want to please your God God but I find a walk going on I find that I I can't seem to have Victory I can't seem to overcome my problems my condition the thing that I know that's going to hle me from the kingdom of God the thing that I know that's going to take my life the thing that I I know won't let me go to heaven but I find myself doing it and I know God is not pleased with you but I can't help myself see something would be vastly wrong with our mind if we saw an 18 Willer coming down the street and it's going about 50 miles an hour and for us to run out in front of it it'll be something wrong but we see a train coming wide open and and you going to get on the track say I don't believe the train going run over me I don't believe that 18 Willer can hit me you know it's so many things in life that you think that you a you're bigger than that 18 wheel line the train come on come on I'm super man I'm wonder the woman I'll stop it are you with me those imaginary things we find ourselves recognizing I'm only human I'm just a man but Lord let me for thy sake live one day at a time are you with me so I I go back here and says through faith we understand you can't understand god without faith without faith it's impossible to please him we understand that the world were framed by the what word of God without the word of God you don't exist I don't exist the world don't exist so that the things which are seen were not made of what things that do appear if you're going to understand God you're going to have to have faith often times people say God don't exist Does that mean God don't exist I don't believe in God does that mean that God is Not godone are you with me if God is not dictated whether you believe God exists or not whether you believe there is a God or not God's still God and God still exists doesn't matter to you he don't exist but amen nature even tells you if you look up in the sky and you see the stars you see the Sun and the Moon and you see the mountains and the trees amen nature you tell you it come from somewhere are you with me so John uh 3 and three uh St John 3 and3 so though though man in his intellectual knowledge amen lean not to all this intellectual knowledge we go to school and we may get a bachelor degree a doctor degree or whatever and and often times men lean to their their learning their education uh the uh sometimes man leads amen maybe says I'm a Street man and I I I I come up in the streets man and I don't lean to that get you in prison are you with me get you killed are you with me leaning to your own understanding amen take your father and farther away from God if you want to get far away from God keep on trusting in yourself but the Bible says lean not to your own understanding but in all thy ways what amen is then it tell you to trust in the Lord with what all thy heart amen and that's what it's all about brother sister friend it is whether or not we going to trust in the you know it hit me real hard I was just stand in prayer and said trust in the Lord with all your heart I said Lord thank you Lord with everything I got I want to trust you amen and where I fail Lord help me amen because I want to trust in you with all my heart you know it it's something about opening your mouth up it's something about opening your mouth the devil don't want you to do it but Lord I trust you how many this morning and trust the Lord Lord I trust you praise God I trust you Lord Jesus with all my heart amen I think the devil would tie your tongue up and paralyze your tongue to keep you from saying that try to say it I trust in the Lord with what okay say it one more time let me hear you I some of y'all I missed some of y'all I can't see all y'all at the same time even though I got four eyes but I I want to see trust in the Lord with what I see some of y'all got your mouth just shut why because the devil know he got your tongue cuz with the mouth confession is made into what salvation isin't that right and when you start confessing something something start taking place on the inside but the devil tie your tongue up and make you amen I I I iin I ain't going to say that because I know I ain't right that that but your tongue will start getting you right I said when you start confessing with your mouth the Lord Jesus Christ you'll be delivered amen your tongue will start getting you right did I say that soon you get out church tell them I heard you say it said BR bro I heard you say it sister I heard you say it say I I didn't mean it amen see don't don't try to back out of it but if you you know don't try to back out and say Lord that's that's what I want I'm weak but you strong God I want to I I want to do it I want I I really want to live right I really want to go to heaven I really want to be saved I would want to be a Christian in my heart I really want it amen but I'm struggling I'm struggling that's all right praise God keep on keep on going forward amen things have changed I had my struggles as a young Christian but Lord brought me through my struggles are you with me we all got our struggles but keep on pressing praise God things will change if you keep pressing mama say son keep on coming to church keep on coming son oh church was it wasn't quite you know sometimes we battle even just to get to church amen because if you not doing right you you're battering you know you don't feel right in church not doing the right thing like if you go to club and you ain't going to be drinking and smoking and cursing and doing all that stuff you don't feel right in that place I've been to one one time I thought I was I knew I was in I was telling the the fellas on the football players we meeting after about 50 years I said man I said I went to club one time and I looked at one of the Tony the karate school I said Tony you up in the club he said he said he I've been there a few times I believe Tony went thought Tony would like me I said man I thought I was in I thought I was in hell in there I wasn't say but I thought I was in hell I said Oho goodness look at us drink and smoking all this all music people I said God this is a place I don't want to be I said I don't pay my money to get in here but thank the Lord I getting out of here now you know what I'm saying that's a place you don't want to be amen as a son or daughter of God you find yourself in the wrong place this is a place that amen Lord have mercy it's a miserable place you have to drink to go there or smoke a joint or something you got to do something to get in that place I said man how can you live in and how can you go to a place and be happy and such a an environment like that got to be something wrong y'all understand oh and they to ask you why you come to church they think something wrong with you all these lights and all y'all notice the new style Church try to make it like the night club that's a new style church and your boy Kurt you know he he doing all that nasty dancing for the gospel you know what I'm saying and people say you know going along with it the nightclub you know what I'm saying man goodness that's not you know delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you what desires of your heart I'm GNA tell you something brother and sister if you got it if it's if you blown to God something down in your heart ain't going to let you hear uh receive everything amen if you blown to God God knows them that are his if you belong to God it's something different about you it doesn't matter how you try to fit in something different why because you blown to God it don't it don't matter how you try to get around it you different anyhow I don't care if you try to look like them act like them talk like them you're still different why because God Made You Different you ain't fitting in they ain't going to let you fit in are you with me because you're different God Made You Different you said well you know you can try to you know fit in but it won't work I'mma tell you something brothers and sisters you are not supposed to be out there with the Sinners amen if you can hear me amen you'll never be accepted as a sinner because God saw you before the foundation of the world and he knew you were meant to be saved and to be a Christian and to go to heaven amen you're not supposed to be in one of those nightclub churches where they doing all that dancing and jump I mean it's all right to dance but dance in the spirit not in the you know I want you to doing no what it Call It twerking I don't know what that is but you all know what it is but but you you know what I'm saying people doing all kind of crazy stuff are you with me but you you you a son and daughter of God don't let that when you see that stuff in the church run for your life amen I got to get out of here just like I got out that nightclub man I went to church one night they invited me to the church I went to church they had all the lights off they had it nice and black in there and I said oh goodness there a mixed congregation and it come out and I thought Elvis was in there oh man they were gone going at it Lord have mercy what is going on in here that was about 10 or 15 years ago I said Lord I'm trying to figure it out I stayed around stayed around and I listened to the a man preach outstanding preacher nice word I said what what all this all of this extra curriculum activity what all this about a man preaching a nice word amen and that's what that's what get you sometime the atmosphere is all all weird but if you listen to the sermon it's a nice message listen to the heart of the preacher I said man I love that love that fell that fell look like he you know saying stuff really got me you know what I'm saying why all of this you know I said I thank God I thank God for his Mercy his grace upon my life yes I have it all black in here too are you with me cuz cuz I I I said that's what it's going to take to get the young people in the church to put put it all black and put the flashing lights in like they had it but is that what it's going to take for you to go to heaven we might can get the young people in the church because they they can go on and get down you know you know they can go I can't dance anyway so you never could but they can go on and get their thing going you know and and feel comfortable but what is it to God will it grieve God's spirit would it upset God With God can we do that stuff in heaven the church that's supposed to be like going to heaven it's supposed to be a place that we come to worship God Amen can we take that kind of worship and take it in heaven and will it will we dance before God like that and God Is So holy are you with me or will we come worshiping God like we do yeah I'm glad to be here you didn't get to heaven that's how you going to look I see some of y'all faces you going to look like that you going to look like God thank you thank you Lord I made it don't you think you going to holl out then you better holl out now are you with me you better start praising God now because you want if you don't do it over here you know somebody said it's only rehearsal when I get to heaven I'm what I'm really sing and shout amen so we rehearsing over here how we want to do when we get over there amen so what happens amen uh lean not to your own understanding but in all that ways acknowledge Him and He will direct you know I was praying and I said God why do you want me to speak this message he said because somebody's looking for direction I heard it loud and clear he said somebody is looking for direction and I want you to tell them amen my word is your direction amen praise God my word my Bible is your guide It's Your Direction that's what you need somebody's trying to make up their mind
