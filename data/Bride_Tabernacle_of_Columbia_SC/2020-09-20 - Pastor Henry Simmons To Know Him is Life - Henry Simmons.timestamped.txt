[39:30] as we stand for the reading of the word

[39:35] all your land serve the lord with
[39:38] gladness
[39:39] come before his presence with singing
[39:42] know ye that the lord he is god
[39:45] it is he that has made us and not we
[39:48] ourselves we are his people
[39:51] and the sheep of his patch and
[39:54] into his gates with thanksgiving and to
[39:56] its courts with praise
[39:59] be thankful unto him and bless his name
[40:03] for the lord is good his mercy
[40:06] is everlasting and his truth endure
[40:10] to all generation may god bless you
[40:13] reading this word you may be seated
[40:17] psalm 63.
[40:25] the bible says old taste and see that
[40:27] the lord he's good
[40:30] we're serving a god that's so good
[40:35] and his mercy endured forever
[40:39] psalm 63 says
[40:43] oh god thou art my god early will i
[40:47] seek thee my soul thirsts for thee my
[40:52] flesh long for thee
[40:54] in a dry and a thirsty land where no
[40:57] water is to see thy power
[41:00] and thy glory so as i have seen
[41:05] thee in the sanctuary because thy
[41:08] lovingkindness is better than life
[41:11] my lips shall praise thee thus will i
[41:14] bless thee
[41:15] while i live i will lift up my hands
[41:20] in thy name
[41:25] we thank the lord for the word again
[41:29] we thank the lord this morning because
[41:33] to know him is life
[41:39] to not to know him is another thing
[41:44] to think that we know him
[41:47] is trouble because
[41:53] we're living in america and most people
[41:56] that we see and we meet you go to the
[42:00] grocery store
[42:02] you get something they say god bless you
[42:06] the restaurant or anywhere you go
[42:09] the people will say god bless you
[42:14] so they may be
[42:17] um saying something
[42:22] vulgar or cursing or whatever but
[42:27] they come out their mouth and they say
[42:29] god bless you
[42:32] and if you relax the average person
[42:37] no matter what their condition is and
[42:39] how they live their lives
[42:43] they said i know god
[42:47] somebody was just telling me
[42:51] the experience that they had with god
[42:55] and because they had certain experience
[42:58] with god they said i know the law
[43:02] and i know god
[43:08] to know him is to love him
[43:12] are you with me to know him is to love
[43:16] him
[43:19] you know we presume and we venture
[43:21] without authority
[43:22] we think we know one another but do we
[43:25] really know one another
[43:30] somebody said well i live with my wife
[43:33] or my husband and i know him
[43:36] i know her
[43:40] and sometimes we find ourselves in a
[43:42] learning experience
[43:47] we find ourselves that life itself is
[43:49] evolving and going from day to day
[43:52] and things change some things that come
[43:55] out of us we didn't know was in us
[44:02] some of the twists and turns that we do
[44:04] in life we find out that we never
[44:06] thought
[44:07] we'll take those twisters in those turns
[44:14] sometimes it's something things that
[44:16] come out of our mouth or we never
[44:18] thought we'd say
[44:23] sometimes it's thing that folks do in
[44:25] life that they said they never do
[44:31] but you know somebody said just keep on
[44:34] living
[44:36] just keep on living and you'll find out
[44:38] life
[44:40] life has his ups and his downs
[44:47] and sometimes even individuals that you
[44:50] think you know
[44:54] sometimes the ones that you think you're
[44:56] so close attached to
[44:58] sometimes your best friend can be your
[45:00] worst enemy
[45:06] you could not tell judas that he didn't
[45:09] know the law
[45:13] because judas had that personal contact
[45:16] with the lord
[45:17] and he was able to you know
[45:21] be a friend jesus when judas had
[45:24] betrayed him and kissed him and he said
[45:27] friend you betray me with a kiss
[45:32] so he can get close enough to him that
[45:35] he could kiss him
[45:37] he can feel that kind of way
[45:40] that he perhaps said i love him
[45:44] but he denied it
[45:48] peter probably thought he had such a
[45:51] relationship with god
[45:55] that he really knew he really knew the
[45:58] lord
[46:03] to know him as life
[46:07] peter said i i i
[46:11] don't deny you i would never deny you
[46:16] why because he thought that his
[46:18] relationship with
[46:21] jesus was so tight
[46:24] that he wouldn't let anything separate
[46:27] him from the jesus that he knew
[46:31] the messiah that he confessed
[46:34] but yet he cursed and swear that i don't
[46:37] even know the man
[46:40] are you with me so even in our christian
[46:44] walking and in our life
[46:46] we might think and presume that we know
[46:49] god
[46:49] because we come to church
[46:52] maybe because we pay our tithes and our
[46:56] offering or maybe because we are
[46:58] faithful to church
[47:01] we can say i know him
[47:05] but remember i said to know him is life
[47:10] are you with me so he says that loving
[47:14] kindness is
[47:15] better than life
[47:19] because because sometimes we
[47:22] look at this perverted life that came
[47:25] through sin
[47:28] and uh that we're traveling through amen
[47:32] it's not god's life it's not zoe it's
[47:34] not god's life
[47:37] this is a temporary
[47:40] life that you might see in the physical
[47:43] realm and you're able to contact
[47:45] with your five senses and maybe with
[47:47] your affection your imagination and
[47:49] content
[47:50] and memory but down in the soul do you
[47:52] know it
[47:56] in your soul do you know him
[47:59] in the depths of your heart do you know
[48:02] the law
[48:05] because to know him is life
[48:11] sometimes the way we conduct ourselves
[48:15] amen your response to his word
[48:22] how you respond to you to the word of
[48:25] god
[48:26] it determines whether you know him or
[48:28] not
[48:31] see because our response amen to his
[48:34] word
[48:35] seem as though that we are so far from
[48:37] you lord
[48:41] because we are not in contact
[48:44] with the one that we say we know and
[48:47] that we love
[48:53] many times the ones that say they know
[48:55] the law
[48:58] i wanted to go to the script of the
[48:59] scripture but i'll tell you some stories
[49:01] about
[49:02] the different ones that knew said they
[49:04] know the law
[49:08] nevertheless i think apostle paul
[49:12] he was called saul of tarshish i believe
[49:15] he can say i know the lord
[49:19] he probably could quote most of the
[49:22] bible
[49:23] that was in the old testament and he
[49:26] probably
[49:27] amen had exceeded amen education
[49:30] and intelligent wise he was very
[49:33] intelligent and
[49:34] he amen he knew the law
[49:38] in other words the bible said the letter
[49:41] killed it but the spirit gave it life
[49:44] but he knew the law he was so very
[49:48] versed in the word
[49:52] are you with me it reminded me of paul
[49:55] amen he said i didn't come to you
[50:00] they met with excellency of speech uh
[50:03] enticing words of man's wisdom
[50:07] amen but he realized that uh all of this
[50:10] uh uh intellectual amen
[50:14] ism uh uh it didn't
[50:17] amen it didn't cause me to uh know
[50:20] or to understand god i i thought i
[50:24] i knew him because i was taught
[50:27] the word and i i i i i i was
[50:31] zealous for god and amen i i
[50:34] i i i i i what i knew i put it in
[50:38] action amen i would fight
[50:42] and i would amen i was able to stand up
[50:45] for what i believe
[50:48] i believed that in the jewish religion
[50:50] that there was only one god
[50:53] amen he said know ye that the lord he's
[50:56] god
[50:57] and he probably was very versed in
[50:59] isaiah
[51:00] amen and he knew that he said amen god
[51:03] should have no other god before men
[51:06] and know ye amen
[51:11] that besides me there was no god form
[51:14] neither shall i be after me he knew that
[51:18] there was only one god
[51:21] here oh israel for the lord our god is
[51:23] one lord
[51:25] but here there's one called jesus in
[51:28] acts 9 this one
[51:30] called jesus
[51:33] amen that folks are going out
[51:36] worshiping the one that called jesus
[51:40] as it was in that day in the early
[51:43] churches so it is in dusty
[51:49] paul says had they known him
[51:53] they would not have crucified the lord
[51:55] of glory
[51:57] amen he said which none of the princes
[51:59] of this world knew
[52:01] if they would have known who he was
[52:05] they would not have killed him
[52:09] are you with me i believe that he's been
[52:12] crucified today
[52:14] in many of the churches today
[52:20] the very word that they say they believe
[52:24] the very god they say they trust
[52:27] brother and sister let's not put it on
[52:29] the church let's put it on
[52:31] yo let's look deep within us
[52:36] and let's examine ourselves
[52:40] do we really know the lord
[52:47] the father said no yes that the lord he
[52:50] is
[52:52] god amen for many people
[52:56] don't know that the lord is god
[53:00] so paul on his way down to the masters
[53:03] amen a light shine from heaven he's
[53:06] going to persecute the church
[53:10] a lot of times folk came in and they
[53:13] they prosecute the very word in the very
[53:17] bible
[53:17] they say they believe the very god that
[53:21] is supposed to be starving
[53:23] they prosecute them very wide
[53:27] the very masses that is supposed to be
[53:30] they've
[53:30] prosecuted
[53:39] there's an impersonation of christianity
[53:43] amen people they meant say
[53:46] they love god
[53:49] amen that's why they meant
[53:53] jesus was saying the same tombs that
[53:56] they meant that you amen acknowledged
[53:59] and
[54:00] they met in the same tunes they meant
[54:03] that you were
[54:04] honoring abraham odds and jacob and the
[54:07] prophets of old amen
[54:09] you're the one that put them in there
[54:11] [Music]
[54:12] same ones you killed your father you of
[54:17] your father the devil
[54:20] could they take that no
[54:24] because the very god of the prophets
[54:27] were there
[54:28] standing there the very
[54:32] god that they're supposed to were
[54:34] trusting to come
[54:36] in and to be with them they're very
[54:39] they meant messiah that they were
[54:42] praying that he would come
[54:45] they didn't know it
[54:48] to know him is life
[54:52] he come to give them life
[54:57] but they they they they wanted something
[55:00] physical and
[55:01] tangible and something that they can
[55:03] relate to
[55:05] because their minds had been
[55:08] already uh indoctrinated and
[55:11] they thought that even because of
[55:15] the teachings they meant without them
[55:17] knowing
[55:18] in their subconscious they were looking
[55:20] for god
[55:22] of their particular persuasion and he
[55:25] did not come
[55:26] according to their persuasion
[55:30] brother and sister what are we looking
[55:31] for
[55:33] i said to know him is life
[55:38] what are we searching what do i do what
[55:41] do we want
[55:42] what kind of god are we looking for
[55:47] to know him is a life
[55:50] praise god are we looking for
[55:56] a god of our own choosing our own
[56:00] imagination nevertheless
[56:03] subconsciously paul a saul of tasha's
[56:08] on his way to the masters this god that
[56:12] he was looking for
[56:14] would be amen a pharisee
[56:17] because he was a pharisee of the
[56:20] failures pharisee
[56:23] and the god that they were looking for
[56:25] would be a pharisee
[56:27] and because amen jesus
[56:30] was not amen exalting the pharisees
[56:33] religion and he was not amen
[56:37] a part of their particular persuasion
[56:40] paul says that it must be wrong
[56:45] it must be amen ah this man
[56:49] need this that's this heresies
[56:52] need to be stopped
[56:56] amen because he believed what he
[56:57] believed
[56:59] anything different from that he thought
[57:02] he knew the law
[57:06] he knew him amen according to what he
[57:09] read about
[57:11] he knew him for what he was brought up
[57:14] in
[57:15] sometimes subconsciously amen we only
[57:18] know the god
[57:19] amen because we've been taught
[57:23] somebody taught you amen and you rested
[57:27] upon
[57:28] and you stood upon what you've been
[57:30] taught
[57:32] amen but paul one day he had an
[57:38] experience
[57:40] when the light shines from heaven and he
[57:42] fell to the earth
[57:43] amen he realized this wasn't amen uh
[57:46] the sunlight because it was brighter
[57:49] than the noonday sun
[57:52] he knew that this was a supernatural
[57:54] light
[57:56] and he knew amanda that it was the law
[58:00] something down inside of him said
[58:04] this light amen is god
[58:09] and he said to the light he said who
[58:12] are you lord
[58:18] when he fell he said it's hard for thee
[58:21] to kick against debris
[58:24] amen brother and sister
[58:27] amen you need to shut down in do i know
[58:30] him
[58:32] do i know him
[58:36] come on let's wake up let's get serious
[58:39] about our journey
[58:41] don't wait till it's too late and find

[59:09] i was thirsting amen for a minute a
[59:12] better life

[59:20] escape out of
[59:21] out of my family situation out of my
[59:24] domestic situation
[59:25] i i was searching for a social type
[59:29] gospel i was searching for a church that
[59:32] i can relate to
[59:33] but we don't want something that you can
[59:35] relate to
[59:36] i touch for the living god
[59:40] oh yes lord oh
[59:43] that i might know him in the power of
[59:45] his resurrection
[59:47] paul says and in the fellowship of his
[59:50] suffering

[1:01:14] the light shining in the darkness
[1:01:16] and the darkness comprehended it not
[1:01:20] are you with me it was the pirate god
[1:01:24] the god that was above us became the god
[1:01:27] that was with us
[1:01:29] and the god that was with us became the
[1:01:31] god to join us

[1:10:33] drink some alcohol and smoke a cigarette
[1:10:35] to be happy
[1:10:37] they meant somebody got to have a a man
[1:10:40] to be happy
[1:10:41] somebody got to have a woman to be happy
[1:10:44] they ain't been on and find out that the
[1:10:47] pledges of this world uh
[1:10:49] amen is only going to be here for a
[1:10:50] season
[1:10:52] they meant the body can uh get sick and
[1:10:55] amen a lot of those pledges our eyes can
