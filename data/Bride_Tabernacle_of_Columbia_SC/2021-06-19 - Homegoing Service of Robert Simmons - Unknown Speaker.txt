christ i had many role models but those role models i had was strung out on drugs marijuana alcohol women see but that role model didn't wasn't going nowhere and if i look at some of my friends today

stay down and one thing he taught me was hold your head up square your shoulders be a man that's what he taught me don't fear nobody he said man is grass the grass withered the flowers fade away so it is with man so he taught me to be a man to love my family to love god to fast and to pray he taught me how to minister he he taught me how to witness he just didn't gave me knowledge book knowledge he he gave me hand on knowledge he said come on brother let's go knock on some doors i hadn't had many preachers in my life that would do such a thing knock on the doors with you oh they'll send you out

enough delivers in your son's name we do lift this prayer and all god's people said amen amen amen amen amen what y'all looking at me for oh that's that's my easter speech y'all excuse me i'm so sorry um first of all y'all need to shake it off you might have came here to cry but i came to rejoice i'm not here to come sit here and and tear up and and well up and cry that time is going to come but today right now this moment i'm gonna give god some praise i don't know about you but i came to praise him right now so i'm gonna praise his name for what he has already done cause god is good y'all i said god is good y'all i ain't got no help in here god come on likes god is good protocol has been set and uh we we still got yet a little bit that we want to do and then we're going to dive right into what god has given us for the day amen i promise you i won't be long cause if you've ever seen me preach or heard me preach it takes me about 10 minutes because mama always said daddy you ain't got no but about 15 good minutes after that they're gonna forget everything you said so say what you got to say and sit your behind down and that's exactly how she would say it amen so so first it's a sad frog that can't praise his own pond so i'm going to begin with i thank god for being the head of so many of our lives um and ahead of my life as well but i i do want to send a shout out y'all to my boo um this year makes 25 years um she stuck with me through the thick and the thin y'all know i used to go by grandma house you know over on center street y'all might not know nothing about that but um they used to make this kool-aid and and and the kool-aid would be it would look like grape kool-aid but when you taste it you not only taste great but you taste lemonade in the kool-aid too y'all don't know nothing about that now so so so what my wife is like that kool-aid she can be sweet but she can be taught when she needs to so i thank god for putting her in my life i thank god for that now now now there have been some blessings that have been bestowed upon we simmons children and and i want to run through some of them real quick um as you all know david is the baby boy of the crew um and and david god blessed him with the ability to use his vocal cords now if y'all have never heard my brother saying when we get done if you didn't go to church and you didn't get happy just now with my niece you gonna show enough get happy with him so so god blessed him with that um my my sister um he blessed her to be um a can cutter not not now i don't i don't know if y'all know what a can cutter is i i used to be a can cutter myself but but she is a can-cutter and my brother-in-law he knows this see see my sister don't mind cutting cans whether you are jamaican mexican african or american she will cut you with her tongue if need be hello somebody and then we have our sister who is in the hospital right now um in an extended stage jocelyn jocelyn was blessed let me tell y'all something i can remember my senior year in high school and i needed this one last math class here it is my sister's in the ninth grade tutoring me all year long for me to pass my math class and she's in the ninth grade so the analytical side went to her so there's only really one trait that i took from my parents y'all can you guess what it is hello somebody you recognized it if if someone had to take on all the looks and the debonair that my father would have i'm gonna go ahead and take that mantle and run because god blessed me and and i know my wife is appreciative of that fact she may not say it every night and then but i go and look in the mirror myself and say you some good-looking young man so i thank god for what he has bestowed me with so now that we got you laughing and we got you feeling a little looser we we're going to begin with what god has given us today and and god wanted me to to say this first there was a story once told about a young boy and he would watch this elderly woman this grandmother she would always walk through the graveyard and he would always see her every day walking through the graveyard so one day he decided he was going to go ask the grandmother that was walking through the grave rod why do you walk through the graveyard and she just simply smiled at the little boy and she said i walked through the graveyard because that's my way to get home our father has already walked through his graveyard he's home now y'all so this here message that i'm gonna give today is not about my father it's not for my father but it's for those who are still alive and remain because somebody in here might not have given themselves to christ and this is our opportunity to beckon you to come to him the man the myth and the legend before i get started on that the last time my dad invited me to a program it was one that you combat veterans had over in and something and my dad said i want you and your wife to come to dysfunction um dress up kind of neat you know you need to wear a suit or something and i said okay dad i got you all right i'll be there so i come over there i put on one of my little suits you know listen i don't know about y'all but i go to this um website on on the internet called aliplan or something like that where they had a little 39 suits so i just threw on a suit and i came on out you know and and when i walked in dad had on a uh uh a jacket that was like a a a a i don't know what you want to call it but it was so smoking that i was like from now on i promise you you will not do me like this i am sick and tired of being sick and tired of you showing out with the way you dress around folk trying to make somebody look bad you're not gonna do that to me no more from now on i'm gonna make sure i'm right so that when i'm in your presence i won't look so bad the man the mr legend the man i knew ever since i have a memory i remember this great man from carrying me on his back while he walked to school at night to him warning us about a butt cutting that we were about to get for my mother to the conversations about church and churchy people y'all don't know nothing about churchy people but but he would talk to me in an extended manner about that always giving advice in a soft manner always giving almost to a fault i can remember us kids sitting at the table now if i'm talking over your head please please please just bear with me sitting at the table eating turkey necks y'all y'all don't know nothing about turkey neck see see mama had done something i don't know what she did to them turkey necks but she would have you sitting there sucking on the bones of the turkey necks even to the point where she would have y'all know how you have tomatoes with some fat back in it and and you take the tomatoes and the fat back and you put it over some rice and that became a meal i know y'all don't know nothing about that even to the point where we used to get this what we call round steak that would be diced up and put entire inside some beans and put over some rice y'all might call it beanie weenies but we loved it and if you invite me today to come eat some beanie wings if you can fix it like my mama i promise you i'll be right there with you but to talk about my dad as the myth pbs.org says this is what a myth is it's a story that is based on tradition some say having factual origin while others are fictional but myths are more than mere stories they serve as a more profound purpose in ancient and modern culture culture myths are sacred tales that explain the world of man's experience then when we deal with legend according to webster webster says in webster dictionary it is a story coming down from the past so what i want to talk about today is dealing with something that that my dad really helped me with in understanding how to deal with life and in the end when it's all said and done everything is going to be all right luke 13. i'm coming from luke the 13th chapter starting at verse number 6 and i'm gonna read them to verse number nine if you have it say amen if you look and stay still looking and if you still looking you might as well go ahead and listen to me and it reads as follows and i'm reading from the niv it says then he told a parable a man had a fig tree growing in a vineyard and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any so he said to the man who took care of the vineyard for three years now i've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any cut it down why should it use up the soil sir the man replied leave it alone for one more year and i'll dig around it and fertilize it if it bears fruit next year fine if not cut it down god's word for god's people and today i want to talk to you about the good gardener the good gardener in these particular verses that we're reading god is jesus is telling us a parable y'all and a parable is a story because he wants you to understand kingdom wording but in a natural setting that you can understand so so he's talking about a garden that he has now a vineyard is normally a yard that has all these grape vines all over it and the grapevines are producing grapes but in this particular vineyard there was a fig tree in the vineyard and i don't know why my mind got inquisitive about the the fig tree and i started doing research on the fig tree and i wanted to know more about a fig tree why was he so upset that the fig tree was not producing fruit why would god be so upset with us if we don't produce fruit so so i begin to look up the fig tree and i realize that a fig tree is not like a regular fruit tree y'all see regular fruit trees only produce in particular seasons whereas a fig tree can produce all year long but most fig trees require something a little different see most of our plants on earth they require pollination and that normally comes from a bee y'all but the fig tree has another helper and and i hope i'm like that helper today he has something called a fig wasp see a fig wasp goes and lays their eggs on the fig tree which causes the fig tree to awaken and produce fruit and the walls when they're small eat the fruit that's on the fig tree so the fig tree because it has this wasp can do things a little differently now watch this you can find fig trees on the top of mountains you can find fig trees in the middle of the desert because this particular waltz will go ten times farther to look for a fig tree then a bee would look for anything to pollinate so for this fig tree to go three years without making any fruit because i know that it can bear fruit all year long not just in the summer not just in the winter not just in the spring not just in the fall but it can produce fruit all year long something is going on see god is going to look at your life one day and he's going to ask you why is it that you are not producing fruit if you are not doing what god says do if you are not giving like god said give if you are not doing the things that will make you enter into heaven god said i don't see the fruit but but i i began to listen to what the gardener had to say now the gardener is christ he said hold on give me a little bit of time because i need to deal with with this particular fig tree i need to do something for this fig tree see i need to put something around the fig tree and see if i can cultivate it a little bit more to make it do what it needs to do see what he had to put around it was some fertilizer y'all y'all know there's some different names and some colorful names that we call fertilizer y'all know that right well i'm just gonna call it mess can i deal with that can i just call it mess y'all so so he began to put some mess around the fig tree in order to see if the fig tree was going to develop listen sometimes all of us have some mess in our lives that is put around us but god wants to know whether or not the mess that is put around you is going to cause you to grow or cause you to die so what we have to learn to do as a family y'all as a people y'all as friends y'all we've got to learn to deal with our mess because as long as god is on the throne he takes mess and make it turn from mess to something that is beautiful so you can grow from your mess but see you've got to understand and know that in order for you to grow you've got to have god in your life you can try hard as you might but it won't work unless you let god deliver you from your mess you're going to continue to not produce fruit if you don't let god enter your life but if you allow god to come into your life if you allow him to do what it is that he can do everything is going to be all right but you got to let god in the end in order for it to be so not because you wanted to be so but because god said so so know that the mess has to come come on we got some messy situations that go on in our lives y'all we got some messy situations that we hide in our closets we got some messy situations that everybody knows about but i'm here to tell you if you learn to deal with your mess you will get the fruit that you need but how can you produce fruit if you're not allowing god to enter in god has to come in god has to show himself in your life you have to allow him to do so but if you don't allow god to enter in god is gonna one day cut you down see my father was a cultivator he knew how to take your mess and work with you he knew how to take that mess and say listen you can do better you can work for yourself you can make it you just gotta try a little bit harder you just gotta do this or you might wanna do that but the word says this the word says that you see you get tired sometimes from hearing what he say about what the words say but i'm here to tell you if you listen to what the word says it's gonna be all right but learn to listen to what god has to say not man but listen to god because in the end in the end it's going to be in the end it's going to be in the end it's going to be but you've got to learn to turn it over to him see i can't get you in heaven i can't get you in heaven it is what you do it is the fruit of your labor what is it that you are doing what are you producing is it good fruit is it good fruit is it edible for god listen some of us produce fruit but we know what kind of fruit we producing it ain't the kind of fruit that's pleasing in god's sight god say listen only the just will scarcely make it in so you don't need to tempt god by not producing good fruit you have an opportunity right here right now to say i've got to change something within me i can't worry about everybody else because listen just like my dad had to answer for himself you too will have to answer for yourself one day and when you answer for yourself you want him to say well done my good and faithful servant enter ye into the house of the lord it hurts sometimes it hurts right now for me it hurts for my family but you know what i know that when it's all said and done it's gonna be friends it's gonna be family it's gonna be brother and sister here it's gonna be no family that it's gonna be but we gotta put it in god's hand deal with the mess knowing that god would take your mess and turn it into something beautiful you might be dealing in mess right now but it's going to turn out the way god wants it to god's word for god's people amen praise the lord everyone praise the lord everyone you know i thought about you know what what i could do to honor my dad um it's gonna i'm i'm gonna take y'all a little history for a
