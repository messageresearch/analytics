[36:34] he shall teach you all things and bring
[36:38] all things to your remembrance
[36:40] whatsoever i have said unto you
[36:44] peace i leave you with
[36:46] peace i leave you with you
[36:49] my peace i give unto you not as the
[36:51] world giveth
[36:53] give i unto you let not your heart be
[36:56] troubled
[36:57] neither let it be afraid
[36:59] father we ask you to bless the word
[37:01] tonight lord and
[37:03] quicken it in jesus name amen may be
[37:06] seated
[37:11] i also want to turn to another scripture
[37:14] um go right over to saint john
[37:17] i'm going to just read 16 and 7.
[37:25] saint john 16 7.
[37:32] nevertheless i tell you the truth
[37:35] it is expedient for you that i go away
[37:38] but if i go not away the comforter
[37:41] will not come unto you
[37:43] but if i depart i will send him
[37:48] unto you
[37:49] and when he has come
[37:51] he will reprove the world of sin
[37:53] and of righteousness and of judgment
[37:56] amen appreciate the lord tonight there i
[38:00] want to just
[38:01] uh for a few minutes tonight
[38:04] talk to you
[38:06] on a little thought that came
[38:09] to our hearts
[38:11] and i entitled it
[38:13] i believe i gave them
[38:15] your comforter your comforter
[38:19] but i really sub topic my comforter
[38:24] my comforter
[38:26] and the reason why i wanted to say like
[38:29] that because
[38:30] i'm understanding that um the things
[38:34] that god has
[38:36] uh given to you and i and it's our
[38:40] thing that uh he have put inside of the
[38:43] word
[38:45] and promises that he has uh given to the
[38:48] believers
[38:50] but i'm finding out that if we don't
[38:52] accept those things
[38:56] in a personalized way
[38:59] and understanding that these things are
[39:03] ours
[39:06] and getting more a little more specific
[39:08] their minds
[39:11] and we have to take it personally
[39:15] because god give it personally
[39:19] each one of us
[39:22] has these promises that god
[39:25] has given and he made it available
[39:30] he made it so that you don't even have
[39:33] to work for it
[39:35] he freely
[39:37] gave his life
[39:39] that you and i can be beneficiaries
[39:43] of what he has done at calvary
[39:46] on calvary when he before he by head he
[39:49] said it is finished
[39:52] in other words everything that he ever
[39:56] wanted to accomplish
[39:58] it was done
[40:01] and it wasn't something as we read it
[40:03] here it said when he come
[40:08] so it was
[40:09] one person
[40:11] it was one god
[40:14] that made this provision he
[40:18] he did it so and he must have seen in
[40:20] this hour
[40:22] that we were going to need a comforter
[40:27] and all that is going on in this hour
[40:30] all that's going on in our life
[40:34] all the things that we're having to deal
[40:37] with
[40:38] it can bring great sorrow to you
[40:42] but when i look inside of the word you
[40:45] know we find consolation
[40:50] that god just didn't leave us
[40:52] empty-handed
[40:54] he just didn't leave us without any kind
[40:57] of hope or
[40:59] without any kind of um uh something we
[41:02] can rest on he gave us the word
[41:07] and that word that god gave us
[41:10] it cannot change
[41:13] the bible say my word it has gone out of
[41:17] my mouth
[41:18] and it shall not
[41:21] return void
[41:23] so we have
[41:25] comfort that though we go through
[41:30] god is able to take care of it
[41:36] i think about and look it up in real
[41:40] not really because i thought about it
[41:41] now looking in this dictionary to see
[41:44] what our comforter really is and it says
[41:48] one that gives comfort
[41:52] you know what i thought about that and
[41:54] you know as humans
[41:57] beings we
[41:59] uh have loved ones and we uh sympathize
[42:02] with people because of tragedy and and
[42:06] because of mishap you know that that
[42:09] happens in their life but
[42:11] really uh that don't really bring the
[42:14] comfort that they really need and it's
[42:16] more we sympathize because we know that
[42:19] it could have been me
[42:22] but the real comforter
[42:26] god wants to uh the bible say hear that
[42:29] that it will be with you forever
[42:33] in other words it will never leave you
[42:38] if god could ever find a place that he
[42:42] can abide in us
[42:45] and that's what he wants he said in my
[42:48] word about it you and you by my word
[42:51] then you can act what you want
[42:58] and i'm learning
[43:01] i'm learning after
[43:03] years
[43:04] and
[43:06] you know just recently i had a birthday
[43:08] intern i'm not 60 yet i always tell my
[43:11] kid i'm already 60.
[43:13] oh well my next birthday i'll be 60 and
[43:16] we just had a wedding anniversary on a
[43:19] new year's night and every 32 years and
[43:22] and i just look back
[43:24] in 32 years and say lord
[43:27] look what you did
[43:31] you know and the things that uh that i
[43:34] say personally i know that you can
[43:36] relate because you got your own
[43:38] testimony
[43:40] and i was just looking at uh my life i
[43:43] had a flashback
[43:45] and and i was just looking at lord the
[43:49] things that i've been through
[43:52] and god i know it had to be you brought
[43:54] me through it
[43:56] because i know that i really shouldn't
[43:59] be here
[44:00] you know i know and you can testify
[44:03] yourself that god has brought us through
[44:06] some treacherous situation
[44:09] but in all i love it y'all we're still
[44:12] here
[44:14] and and that's enough by itself to say
[44:16] god thank you
[44:19] and you may look at your faults you may
[44:21] look at your mistake but y'all god been
[44:24] good
[44:26] i mean he's been so good
[44:28] to where he was better to us than we've
[44:31] been to our own self
[44:35] i was telling the church becky marion
[44:37] that you know as a human being we are
[44:39] self-destructive people
[44:42] and don't even realize that you know we
[44:45] do more damage to our own self
[44:49] because of a lack of understanding what
[44:51] it gonna cost us
[44:54] but even though through all of that
[44:55] that's why that song
[44:57] appreciates the charlotte sing that song
[44:59] the lord knows i'm gonna try to sing
[45:01] myself since the charlotte but you did
[45:02] it you must be saved me the trouble
[45:06] you know but
[45:08] and i look at it that even though when
[45:11] we think god is not working he's working
[45:13] it out
[45:16] oh yes
[45:18] i i was telling
[45:20] brother dan say you know i just woke up
[45:22] this morning
[45:23] and it was such a burden in my heart and
[45:27] i just felt the presence of god being so
[45:30] real there and i said lord i said thank
[45:33] you
[45:34] i said you know because it's something
[45:36] that in the midst of the talmud and all
[45:39] that's going on that you still can have
[45:42] joy
[45:44] and you say well daddy let me tell you
[45:46] something if you ever uh lose it you'll
[45:50] realize how important it really is
[45:53] and what is it it's because of god's
[45:56] grace
[45:58] that had kept us through all that we
[46:02] went through and yet yes we had
[46:04] triumphed yes we had this and yes we had
[46:07] that but god is still good
[46:12] the comforter
[46:15] he's comforted us
[46:18] through all kinds of situations and
[46:21] conditions
[46:23] there is nobody can comfort you like
[46:25] jesus can
[46:28] that's why it is it's so urgent and i'm
[46:31] just thinking without the holy ghost you
[46:35] really don't understand the fullness of
[46:38] the comfort that god gives you
[46:43] even when you don't feel good you
[46:45] realize god it could have been worse
[46:48] than this
[46:52] oh yes sir
[46:54] uh
[46:55] i guess i'll tell a little more y'all
[46:57] not that part but
[46:59] my little testimony
[47:01] my wife kind of over there she said i'll
[47:03] learn more about you in the pool but i
[47:04] do at home
[47:06] you know so something i just don't say
[47:09] too much about you know into the law but
[47:12] it dawned on me today and i said you
[47:13] know you look at your situation and i
[47:16] can look at mine
[47:18] and i can remember so vividly you know
[47:20] when i went through my little more
[47:23] you know and you don't really know what
[47:24] it is
[47:25] ain't no standing if you have to uh
[47:28] stand before a judge or a situation in
[47:32] your life and you don't know what the
[47:34] outcome gonna be
[47:36] because the penalty
[47:39] you know
[47:40] that comes with
[47:41] the choices we make
[47:44] as i say we are self-destructive people
[47:48] we do more damage to our own stuff
[47:51] because of a like of understanding and
[47:54] because that we just don't want to
[47:56] listen sometimes
[47:59] and then when you have to suffer the
[48:01] consequences
[48:03] and i understood those consequences
[48:06] that when what i did in my life and i
[48:09] understand now here i am you know i
[48:12] don't know which way gonna go uh a
[48:14] height gonna turn out because i knew i
[48:17] didn't had no kind of a financial
[48:20] support or loyal support you know the
[48:23] only thing i had was one thing
[48:27] and that was that god was beginning to
[48:30] deal with me
[48:32] and god gave me uh a peace
[48:36] and he gave me a word about it too
[48:39] and i'm not saying this to be funny or
[48:42] or that that but you know uh even when
[48:46] the the troubles have happened
[48:49] and i sat there
[48:50] facing this job here with 200 and
[48:53] something years in prison
[48:57] but guess what i wasn't even threatened
[49:00] about it one bit
[49:03] i wasn't shaking i
[49:05] looked through your arm in his face and
[49:07] tell me sir i did those things
[49:10] i said but i am sorry i said i know that
[49:12] don't mean much now i should have
[49:14] thought more about it before i got to
[49:16] this point
[49:17] but i didn't i said i wasn't raised that
[49:20] way
[49:21] i mean he told me those things went up
[49:23] but what had happened early previously
[49:26] as i was walking around my neighborhood
[49:29] and you know you really think about life
[49:33] and you look at life as what is it
[49:36] really all about and sometimes as the
[49:40] devil always paint the picture the
[49:42] having a good time
[49:45] but you'll find out
[49:46] it ain't a good time
[49:49] because what it costs is you
[49:52] and the penalty and what you have to
[49:56] deal with because of your own decisions
[50:00] and i like to say that no matter what
[50:02] decision you make whether it's good or
[50:04] bad you got to live with it
[50:10] i tell my children sometime
[50:12] i said lord i wish i would really back
[50:15] into school with a little boy again i'll
[50:17] be real good
[50:19] if i could take them years back
[50:22] instead of giving the teachers all that
[50:23] problem and not doing what i ought to be
[50:26] i said i'll be a student
[50:28] but guess what it's gone
[50:31] i can't take it back
[50:34] sometime as adult
[50:36] we wish
[50:37] my daughter would say lord have mercy if
[50:40] i know a daughter who will come in all
[50:42] this right here
[50:43] you'll stay a child young as you can as
[50:46] old as you can
[50:49] because it comes with responsibility
[50:52] it comes with making decision it come
[50:55] with whatever decision you make
[50:58] you're going to have to deal with that
[50:59] the rest of your life
[51:02] but i was going to uh
[51:04] before my hearing and i went by this
[51:07] place and you know i always say that you
[51:10] know
[51:11] when god deals with a person god don't
[51:14] need no help
[51:17] because when god do it he do it right
[51:21] a lot of times we try to help god out
[51:23] with it but a lot of if we just can pray
[51:27] and let god work it out let god handle
[51:30] it
[51:31] because god knows how and when and what
[51:35] to do
[51:37] and a lot of times we don't get the
[51:38] right results because we always want to
[51:41] try to do something
[51:43] to help god out
[51:46] but god may not work fast like you want
[51:48] to but i want to tell you when he works
[51:51] he works
[51:54] and when he works right it lastes too
[51:57] but if somebody force you in and push
[52:01] you to do it and twist you to do it you
[52:04] would do it for a little while but guess
[52:05] what
[52:06] that'll weigh off
[52:10] i remember the servant of god had told
[52:12] they were his deacon one time and billy
[52:14] paul had did some things and he was in
[52:16] the church that brother baptist was
[52:17] preaching so hard you know on saying
[52:20] different things and
[52:21] deacon you know he he kind of pushed
[52:23] billy paul to go up there and and get
[52:26] prayed for it but
[52:28] because don't you never do that
[52:30] he said because with god dealing with
[52:32] him then god gonna deal with him see
[52:35] and god knows how he knows when
[52:38] you know and sometimes it'd be a rough
[52:40] way but sometimes that's god's best way
[52:44] because when you get it you got it
[52:47] and i can remember you know so vividly
[52:49] that as i was walking you know what like
[52:52] my hair was coming i went by where we
[52:55] used to live at and the house was torn
[52:57] down and everything you know but as i
[52:59] was walking past there and uh something
[53:02] that spoke to my heart and told me
[53:04] you're gonna have to go away but it's
[53:06] gonna work out for you good
[53:09] and i'm saying to myself you know i know
[53:12] i might be crazy
[53:14] you know but hai is going for this man
[53:16] here and not knowing what's going to
[53:18] happen you know and i know i'm doomed
[53:20] because i'm guilty
[53:22] you know but even when i went to the
[53:25] courtroom i had such a peace
[53:29] not because i'd be glad to go to jail
[53:31] now
[53:32] you know but it's just that something
[53:35] had begun to happen
[53:38] and let me tell you something i wasn't
[53:39] going to no church during that time
[53:41] either
[53:43] i haven't even heard anything about the
[53:44] message of the hour
[53:47] i know i had a mother that prayed
[53:51] and i know that she prayed for us
[53:54] but then even after all the debt i had
[53:57] to went down a certain course
[54:00] because of my own stubbornness
[54:03] because of my own choice i made them
[54:06] choices
[54:08] so i began to tell him don't none of
[54:10] y'all come to that courthouse none
[54:13] i said i'm gonna be okay you're gonna
[54:15] work out for my good
[54:17] and i stood there one of my sisters
[54:18] still came
[54:20] you know what not but another rest of
[54:22] them came
[54:23] but you know when i stood there you know
[54:26] and i think about it now
[54:28] i said lord you've been even comforted
[54:31] me when i was in era
[54:34] and you gave me a peace
[54:37] even when i could have got life
[54:39] sentences
[54:41] but when i stood there and in the whole
[54:44] time this process going through
[54:46] i never was worried about
[54:49] when i'm gonna get out and how it is you
[54:51] know because god was dealing with me he
[54:54] gave me a peace
[54:56] within me
[54:59] and i know that i haven't i didn't have
[55:01] the holy ghost then
[55:03] no no it just i was the spirit of god
[55:06] was dealing with me
[55:08] and he was taking me somewhere
[55:11] and i'm gonna tell you young people if
[55:13] you just listen to that voice of god
[55:17] it may be a voice that screamed it may
[55:20] not take you to be the popular way but
[55:23] it'll be the best way
[55:25] because everything i found out that god
[55:28] does is for our own good
[55:33] even sometimes the road he allow us to
[55:37] go through oh my when you look back on
[55:40] it and you say god thank you so much
[55:45] because i'm about to kill my own self
[55:49] but the comforter
[55:51] and i can remember
[55:53] uh
[55:54] you know after we came down he moved
[55:57] um
[55:58] in marion got married and all and
[56:01] me and my wife we had uh talked to
[56:04] brother simmons
[56:06] and i believe that um prior to that
[56:08] meeting
[56:09] he will be having brother john simon
[56:13] up here for service
[56:15] uh weekend services um
[56:17] and so we talked about seven prior to
[56:19] that before that
[56:21] and we were just talking to him about
[56:22] the holy ghost
[56:23] with my wife you know that we wasn't
[56:25] sure we needed some kind of
[56:27] you know proof of some something that
[56:29] you know that we are know
[56:31] you know that we have it
[56:34] and brother john simon had preached that
[56:36] night and that was his thought
[56:38] the holy ghost
[56:40] and i'm telling you something he
[56:42] thundered that message so and he
[56:45] preached his soul
[56:47] and we went back home that particular
[56:49] night
[56:50] you know and i and i told my wife i said
[56:52] look i said i'm gonna stay up here i'm
[56:55] gonna pray
[56:56] i say because i got to know i got to
[56:58] have it
[56:59] you know i said because i wasn't certain
[57:02] you know i know something had happened
[57:04] but it's just something yes there wasn't
[57:07] deep enough you know within me
[57:09] and that night and we stayed up
[57:13] a good little while that night i don't
[57:15] know how long but i remember so vividly
[57:19] how that when we cried out and we cried
[57:22] pull our hearts out to god there
[57:24] and and the holy ghost came down in such
[57:28] a way
[57:29] i'm telling you about the earthquake i
[57:30] felt like i had one that night in the
[57:32] house
[57:33] i mean it just shook
[57:36] you know like the whole house had shook
[57:39] and like something just
[57:42] thundered down fire
[57:44] and i began just to holler out and start
[57:46] praising god you know what not because i
[57:49] know something had happened
[57:52] and from that time
[57:55] my life has never been the same again
[57:59] yes it was still a spiritual growth
[58:01] caleb
[58:03] even after you get baptized in the holy
[58:05] ghost it's a growth
[58:08] and god begin to lead you in and to
[58:11] teach you and begin to deal with you
[58:14] because we've got to grow up
[58:17] and as we did that for one state to the
[58:20] next you know god empowered and began to
[58:24] do things in our lives you know and i
[58:27] know i couldn't do it
[58:29] see and that's what i look at the things
[58:32] that i know i couldn't do
[58:35] god did it
[58:36] the peace
[58:38] and the love of god that came
[58:41] in me
[58:42] that you know i didn't have no enemies
[58:46] i wasn't looking for no it's just like
[58:48] everything but just uh just i ca you
[58:52] can't uh explain it
[58:54] but i know
[58:55] he came
[58:57] what was it the comforter
[59:01] and i like it when i thought about it
[59:03] the other day
[59:04] and just dropped on my on my heart and
[59:07] that i will never
[59:10] leave you
[59:13] you know people will leave you you know
[59:16] sometimes your husband a wife and
[59:18] children but the comforter he will be
[59:22] with you forever
[59:25] through
[59:26] everything that you are dealing with
[59:29] ain't got to go through he's right there
[59:33] they say i'm saying even in the midnight
[59:36] hour
[59:37] when you're all alone and nobody seems
[59:41] to even know what you are dealing with
[59:45] he's still there
[59:47] and he began you know just to give you a
[59:49] little peaceful assurance yeah
[59:52] i'm with you

[59:56] you are not alone because i'm the
[59:59] comforter

[1:00:03] you
[1:00:04] i'm the one that's bringing you where i
[1:00:07] want i'm the one that calls you
[1:00:11] and i called you to myself
[1:00:14] and what i want for you is to submit
[1:00:18] your life to me and let me take over
[1:00:22] you didn't have your time you didn't
[1:00:24] mess it up now i'm gonna show you how i
[1:00:27] can do it without your help
[1:00:32] i'll tell you what
[1:00:36] it's getting so good
[1:00:39] i was just thinking you know and i hope
[1:00:41] that you feel the same way
[1:00:44] my christian experience
[1:00:47] is is much enhanced
[1:00:50] than than it has ever been
[1:00:54] things that i'm reading and things that
[1:00:56] i'm even going back and looking over
[1:01:00] i'm wondering whether or not i ever read
[1:01:02] it i know i have but now it's coming
[1:01:06] alive
[1:01:08] the word is just not uh um for peter and
[1:01:12] paul and mary but now it's mine
[1:01:17] see
[1:01:18] it is yours
[1:01:20] but until you accept this book
[1:01:24] the holy bible
[1:01:27] as being for you
[1:01:29] you've been living on things that
[1:01:32] somebody else did
[1:01:34] and don't do that because god got so
[1:01:37] much he want to show you
[1:01:40] see we're in the days that we're written
[1:01:43] epistles
[1:01:48] god in flesh
[1:01:51] through jesus christ
[1:01:54] now i'm jesus in flesh
[1:01:56] in a minimum of bride
[1:02:00] god tabernacling in earthly vessels
[1:02:03] again to do what finish the work
[1:02:07] didn't let he say the works that i do
[1:02:11] you gonna do
[1:02:13] what who is you
[1:02:15] who isn't you
[1:02:18] i don't know about you but it's me
[1:02:21] see because this book uh we like to say
[1:02:25] i hear people say about the open book
[1:02:27] let me tell you something it ain't open
[1:02:29] to you if you're walking in the thing
[1:02:31] that god spoke of you
[1:02:34] you know and i said yeah the seventh c
[1:02:37] but that book ain't open to you if
[1:02:39] you're not walking in the light of the
[1:02:42] age that god gave you the promise
[1:02:46] that's why the bible say that
[1:02:48] these signs shall
[1:02:52] follow who
[1:02:54] who is them
[1:02:56] i mean they remember bride
[1:02:59] you gotta go forth and show that this
[1:03:02] god we talking about
[1:03:04] oh sister iris said he is not dead he is
[1:03:08] still alive
[1:03:10] how do you know because i feel him in my
[1:03:12] feet
[1:03:14] i feel him in my hand
[1:03:16] he lives within me
[1:03:19] it's him that keeping me and not me
[1:03:22] myself
[1:03:25] yeah i got
[1:03:28] proof of his resurrection
[1:03:32] because like paul said the life
[1:03:35] that i now live
[1:03:38] i live it by the son of god
[1:03:40] this life that i live
[1:03:43] the server god said you want to know
[1:03:44] whether or not you've been changed or
[1:03:46] not
[1:03:47] he said look at
[1:03:49] what you were
[1:03:51] and look at where you at now
[1:03:54] and he said that
[1:03:56] you don't see what you done but you see
[1:03:59] what god has done for you
[1:04:02] and that what give me more hope and more
[1:04:05] consolation that i was telling them
[1:04:07] saying i said you can't even trust your
[1:04:09] own
[1:04:10] self this flesh
[1:04:14] i have no confidence in it
[1:04:16] because you have to kill this thing
[1:04:19] you have to let it die and you don't
[1:04:21] want to die
[1:04:23] but you got to kill it
[1:04:26] and that god
[1:04:28] can live
[1:04:30] in you let me just read one thing okay
[1:04:33] the seventh
[1:04:35] he said now i believe that on the day of
[1:04:36] pentecost
[1:04:38] he said the comforter
[1:04:40] which is the holy spirit was given which
[1:04:43] is the spirit of jesus christ
[1:04:46] given to the church
[1:04:48] and he lives in his church
[1:04:50] his people tonight
[1:04:53] just as he lived with them in the body
[1:04:55] of flesh the flesh had to die
[1:05:00] in order to make a sacrifice to redeem
[1:05:04] us back to god
[1:05:06] to pay the penalty of death
[1:05:09] that we committed see
[1:05:13] that's what he did for us
[1:05:15] he paid the penalty of death
[1:05:18] that we committed
[1:05:20] god bless you tonight
[1:05:31] praise the lord amen
[1:05:34] thank god for the word tonight
[1:05:37] the comforter has come
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:40] thank god for the confidence coming in
[1:05:42] our lives tonight
[1:05:44] because without the comfort of where
[1:05:46] would we be amen
[1:05:48] he the spirit of truth has come amen
[1:05:51] giving us peace in the midst of the
[1:05:53] storm
[1:05:54] confident in the midst of all the
[1:05:56] situations and all that going on in this
[1:05:58] world
[1:05:59] god has given us confidence
[1:06:02] consolation and knowing that one day
[1:06:04] soon the lord is coming
[1:06:07] i was talking to sister oh john the
[1:06:09] other day she's
