[41:53] and to all the flock over which the holy
[41:56] ghost has made you overseal to feed the
[41:59] church of god which he has purchased
[42:02] with his own blood 29
[42:13] also of your cells
[42:15] of your own cells
[42:17] shall men arise
[42:19] speaking perverse things to draw away
[42:22] disciples after them
[42:25] thirty-one
[42:34] together and now brethren i commend you
[42:37] to god and to the word of his grace
[42:41] which is able to build you up and to
[42:43] give your inheritance among all them
[42:46] which are sanctified may god bless you
[42:49] in this word you may be seated
[42:51] praise god
[42:52] here it says
[42:57] in the 28th verse take heave therefore
[42:59] unto yourselves
[43:01] and to all the flock of god over which
[43:03] the holy ghost has made you overseal
[43:06] defeat the church of god
[43:08] which he has purchased with his own
[43:10] blood
[43:12] praise god to feed the church of god
[43:15] which he has purchased
[43:17] with his own blood
[43:20] now we want to talk this morning to you
[43:23] concerning the true
[43:24] church now there are many churches
[43:28] but we want to talk about the true
[43:30] church
[43:32] and in that we put emphasis on the true
[43:35] church
[43:36] then in the contrast there is a false
[43:38] church so the true church
[43:42] and when we speak of the true church
[43:45] um
[43:47] it was something that
[43:48] god's servant bought out he said the
[43:50] true church of jesus christ the bride
[43:54] the true church of jesus christ the
[43:56] bride
[43:58] is locking into
[44:00] pure gold
[44:02] her righteousness is his righteousness
[44:06] her attributes are his own glorious
[44:09] attributes
[44:13] her identity is found in him
[44:18] what he is she is to reflect
[44:24] what
[44:26] he had
[44:28] has
[44:29] she is to manifest
[44:32] what he has she is to manifest
[44:37] there's no thought in her
[44:41] she's all
[44:44] glorious within and without
[44:48] from the beginning to the end she
[44:51] is
[44:52] the work
[44:54] of
[44:55] her lord
[44:58] and all
[44:59] his works are perfect
[45:03] in fact in her
[45:06] is summed up
[45:08] and manifested the eternal wisdom and
[45:12] purpose of god
[45:15] how can one phantom it
[45:19] how can one understand it
[45:23] though we cannot
[45:25] do that
[45:27] we can accept it by faith
[45:31] for god
[45:32] has spoken it
[45:35] amen
[45:36] the true church
[45:41] in other words
[45:45] how do we view it
[45:47] by scripture
[45:50] describes him as
[45:53] christ who is our life
[45:57] for christ indeed is
[45:59] the life of the church
[46:03] she has no other life
[46:06] without him she is simply a religious
[46:09] society
[46:11] a club
[46:13] a meaninglessly
[46:15] meaningless
[46:17] gathering
[46:19] of people
[46:21] or courts
[46:24] just like a dead person
[46:30] are you with me
[46:32] that's what she is
[46:34] we're dead without him
[46:36] without him we are just simply
[46:39] uh
[46:40] a
[46:41] courts
[46:43] corpse
[46:44] all right y'all got it
[46:46] but without him that's we just stand
[46:50] are you with me
[46:52] the bible tells us we were dead and
[46:54] trespassed and in sin
[46:57] so without him the true church
[46:59] now uh uh
[47:02] i got up by four o'clock this morning
[47:04] and i was just
[47:06] sitting there
[47:07] it says lord you know there's many
[47:09] things i could say this morning
[47:12] but
[47:14] i
[47:15] i started thinking about
[47:17] some of the things and
[47:19] the thing that was
[47:21] when i was laying down i couldn't sleep
[47:23] i was just talking about thinking about
[47:25] the love of god because we were talking
[47:27] about true love
[47:30] and i was thinking about the love of god
[47:32] and
[47:33] and as i was thinking on the love of god
[47:36] i just think about sometimes people have
[47:38] all kind of reason
[47:40] not to serve god and not to live for god
[47:43] and sometimes people have all kind of
[47:45] reason amen to to not go to church no
[47:48] more not worship no more not serve god
[47:51] no more
[47:53] and i thought about
[47:55] what paul says
[47:57] who
[47:58] shall separate me
[48:01] from the love of god
[48:04] amen and i thought about true love when
[48:06] you really got the love of god right
[48:10] then who should separate us
[48:12] from the love of god
[48:15] and and he said your tribulation of
[48:17] stress persecution of fame and amen
[48:20] sword and necklace
[48:23] who should separate us what what what
[48:25] what's going to get in our way and
[48:27] what's going to stop us from serving god
[48:31] amen i believe the true church she walks
[48:34] amen she has to suffer certain things
[48:36] but she walks in victory
[48:40] she'll let nothing separate us
[48:44] amen the true church
[48:46] amen
[48:48] for paul says
[48:49] amen
[48:51] she's led as a sheep counter to the
[48:53] slaughter
[48:55] amen nay in these things we are more
[48:57] than conquered
[48:59] amen
[49:01] through him that loves us
[49:04] are you with me
[49:06] we understand that he loves us
[49:09] amen though we are the latter the sheep
[49:11] to the slaughter but yay and all these
[49:14] things
[49:16] we're more than conquerors
[49:19] hallelujah
[49:21] amen
[49:22] he says
[49:24] and these things were more than
[49:25] conquered through him they loved us he
[49:27] said well i'm persuaded
[49:29] amen i i i'm convicted i'm persuaded
[49:34] amen i i you see it it it it's things
[49:37] going to come in life and things going
[49:40] to come in
[49:42] in the building of the church amen but

[57:34] if if they if they fail to believe amen
[57:38] the the word amen then people got a
[57:41] problem with the word
[57:43] amen and they walk away from the word
[57:46] amen it's saying that i don't believe
[57:48] the word
[57:51] praise god
[57:52] it ought to be the bible
[57:55] you are not falling in love with the

[59:20] praise god they look at the bible and
[59:22] they don't esteem every word of god
[59:24] being the truth
[59:26] but every word of god is the truth

[59:32] but from genesis to revelation it's the
[59:34] word of god
[59:37] praise god
[59:39] but sometimes we have problems

[59:49] that if it's the word of god amen he
[59:52] didn't ask you to seize it amen praise
[59:55] god
[59:57] you got to take god by faith and not by
[1:00:00] sight

[1:00:07] again he cannot understand the kingdom
[1:00:09] he cannot see the kingdom of god he

[1:00:16] ghost without the holy ghost amen you
[1:00:19] can't understand the love
[1:00:22] praise god
[1:00:23] so without the baptism of the holy ghost

[1:08:22] settled and be not moved away from the
[1:08:26] hope of the gospel

[1:12:25] the holy ghost
[1:12:27] amen in the holy ghost is in the church

[1:15:34] where is
[1:15:37] they feed the it
[1:15:38] i'm supposed to be in ephesian two okay
[1:15:39] it says
[1:15:41] uh 20. it says
[1:15:43] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:15:45] word
[1:15:47] the apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:15:49] himself being what
[1:15:51] chief cornerstone in whom also what
[1:15:54] the buildings fit the frame together
[1:15:56] until what
[1:15:58] the holy temple in the lord in whom
[1:16:00] ye also are built together for what
[1:16:04] inhabitation god through the spirit amen
[1:16:07] you're built upon the foundations of the
[1:16:08] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:16:10] himself me and the chief tony stone
[1:16:13] somebody
[1:16:14] said we don't need apostles no more we
[1:16:16] don't need prophets no more but that's
[1:16:17] what you're built
[1:16:18] upon amen
[1:16:21] the original church of the book of acts
[1:16:24] amen the true church will be a pattern
[1:16:27] of the original
[1:16:29] what it was in the original show shall
[1:16:31] it be at the end
[1:16:33] she would always pattern herself after
[1:16:35] the
[1:16:36] the original church the first church she
[1:16:39] would pattern herself the same
[1:16:42] if they had apostles prophets
[1:16:44] evangelists pastors and teachers
[1:16:47] amen if they had it in the original
[1:16:49] church then it should be in
[1:16:52] the end are you with me
[1:16:55] now you say well there's no more
[1:16:56] apostles no more prophets and no more
[1:16:59] well it shouldn't mean no more preachers
[1:17:02] are you with me
[1:17:03] shouldn't be no more church
[1:17:05] because if what it was in the original
[1:17:07] why if it's original amen and that's
[1:17:10] what the message of the hour was all
[1:17:12] about to restore your back
[1:17:15] back to the original church
[1:17:17] back to the origin of power
[1:17:20] you should be expecting what happened in
[1:17:22] the book of acts that happened in the
[1:17:24] church
[1:17:25] and if it's not happening we need to
[1:17:27] pray we need to find and seek god
[1:17:29] because that's what's supposed to be
[1:17:31] happening in my life
[1:17:33] amen if it is not happening in my life i
[1:17:35] got to get a hold of god god if you're
[1:17:38] god and if you did it then then you're
[1:17:40] the same god today as you were yesterday
[1:17:43] what happened we cooled off
[1:17:47] what happened people are not expecting
[1:17:49] those things to happen for them
[1:17:52] they expecting they meant them to come
[1:17:54] to church hear a good charming but for
[1:17:56] them actually to be the church
[1:18:00] for them to be the church
[1:18:03] praise god it's another thing they put
[1:18:06] it off as a building an organization a
[1:18:08] group
[1:18:09] a preacher but then
[1:18:11] as an individual i am the church and the
[1:18:14] things that i read about in the bible
[1:18:16] that is me god amen if you call me into
[1:18:19] your church amen i'm blood bought amen
[1:18:22] praise god and i've been purchased with
[1:18:24] the blood amen and i'm bought with the
[1:18:26] price amen oh amen you're the head and
[1:18:30] i'm the body then the body should even
[1:18:33] be operating
[1:18:34] amen lock the head operate
[1:18:37] praise god hallelujah praise god what
[1:18:40] the heck said the party ought to be
[1:18:42] doing amen hallelujah
[1:18:45] glory to jesus
[1:18:47] i'm excited about the word
[1:18:52] ephesians 5. and and
[1:18:55] but it's it's too often how long are you
[1:18:57] going to sit around and say i'm in the
[1:18:59] church
[1:19:02] and just you know listen to the sermon
[1:19:04] saying good song but really look at the
[1:19:06] book of acts and and and just say well
[1:19:10] is that happening in my life why isn't
[1:19:12] it not
[1:19:13] why is it not happening in my life
[1:19:16] and my experience what they experience
[1:19:18] if even if i'm not experiencing that
[1:19:21] shall i be satisfied just coming to
[1:19:23] church and singing songs and then we
[1:19:25] have all kind of fussing and stewing why
[1:19:27] because god ain't doing nothing with you
[1:19:29] as an individual we'll be looking at all
[1:19:31] the kind of things there's something
[1:19:32] wrong with the lights something wrong
[1:19:33] with the copies wrong with this
[1:19:35] something wrong with that we'll be
[1:19:36] thinking about all kind of stuff but
[1:19:38] we're thinking about spiritual stuff and
[1:19:40] we're praying and seeking for a walk
[1:19:41] with god and for god not the building to
[1:19:44] be the church but you as an individual
[1:19:45] to be the church me as an individual in
[1:19:48] my life amen not looking at somebody
[1:19:50] else's life but i'm looking at god amen
[1:19:52] god i want you to be live through me i
[1:19:54] want you to be living in me
[1:19:56] i as an individual but we could look
[1:19:59] down at us
[1:20:01] down the street and say so glad i'm not
[1:20:03] in that church i'm in this church i'm so
[1:20:05] glad i'm not like them i'm like uh-uh
[1:20:07] uh-uh look in the bible amen the bible
[1:20:09] said mark the perfect man i'm gonna
[1:20:11] follow jesus i want to be like jesus i
[1:20:13] want to be like him amen that's who i
[1:20:15] want to be like i don't want to be like
[1:20:17] another church i don't want to be like
[1:20:18] another preacher but i want to be like
[1:20:20] jesus
[1:20:22] are you a man
[1:20:24] praise god that's the perfect man that's
[1:20:25] who i want to be like
[1:20:27] amen that's what you ought to want to be
[1:20:29] like the true church amen those are
[1:20:32] people striving to be like jesus
[1:20:35] amen praise god they want to walk like
[1:20:37] him talk like and live like him amen
[1:20:39] praise god
[1:20:41] that's the true church
[1:20:43] but
[1:20:44] the rest of it just just a society just
[1:20:47] a secret club or something you join it
[1:20:50] and john john the club and
[1:20:52] amen and you do what the little rules
[1:20:54] and regulations carry out join the
[1:20:57] fraternity or whatever and you know go
[1:21:00] through you know you know your rituals
[1:21:02] and all
[1:21:04] and that's what folks have done
[1:21:06] but to really look at
[1:21:08] the church as being an individual amen
[1:21:11] that's
[1:21:12] amen has a
[1:21:14] revealed
[1:21:16] knowledge
[1:21:17] god has revealed himself to her amen
[1:21:20] praise god and she knows who she is
[1:21:23] and she's walking in
[1:21:25] the steps footsteps of jesus christ and
[1:21:28] she understand that she's the word
[1:21:30] amen and that's what happens that's why
[1:21:33] why people cool off because they're so
[1:21:35] accustomed to just doing they're not
[1:21:37] praying and seeking god god amen i see
[1:21:40] this bible this bible is real i wanted
[1:21:42] to i want to be real lord i want i want
[1:21:44] to be like you lord i want to live like
[1:21:47] you i want to walk like you lord i love
[1:21:49] you i want you jesus i want more of you
[1:21:52] see that's all that ought to be our
[1:21:54] desire
[1:21:55] that ought to be what we want that's
[1:21:56] what we desire of god
[1:21:59] but instead we go to church we wonder
[1:22:01] about the songs we wonder about
[1:22:03] you know about the preaching if the
[1:22:05] preacher's preaching the word according
[1:22:07] to amen what's written amen thank god
[1:22:10] for it amen
[1:22:12] but all the other little carnal thoughts
[1:22:15] but as we look at our lives
[1:22:18] examine what we are
[1:22:20] amen are we up to
[1:22:23] or do we need more
[1:22:26] do we need to lord let's get my can i
[1:22:29] get my house in order
[1:22:31] lord because you are the church you're
[1:22:33] the house of god
[1:22:35] you're the temple of the holy ghost amen
[1:22:38] he said destroy this temple in three
[1:22:40] days what
[1:22:41] i'll raise it up again what temple
[1:22:43] what's he talking about
[1:22:45] he's talking about his body isn't that
[1:22:46] right
[1:22:47] praise god you are the body of jesus
[1:22:49] christ isn't that right
[1:22:51] so let's not focus on these carnal
[1:22:53] things but let's focus on
[1:22:56] amen
[1:22:57] jesus christ
[1:23:00] i gotta i gotta close
[1:23:02] uh but by the grace of god
[1:23:04] here we are he says
[1:23:08] i said ephesians 5
[1:23:12] is in 23 it says husband look
[1:23:15] for the husband is the what
[1:23:18] 5 and 23. for the husband is the what
[1:23:22] even as christ is the what
[1:23:26] and he is what
[1:23:28] wherefore as the church is subject to
[1:23:30] christ so let
[1:23:32] the wise be to their wife
[1:23:36] their own husbands and what
[1:23:39] huh
[1:23:41] huh
[1:23:43] and what
[1:23:45] is that what the preachers say
[1:23:49] is that what the preachers say
[1:23:54] see
[1:23:56] and what
[1:24:00] y'all you know sometimes we find it
[1:24:03] difficult
[1:24:06] you do your part
[1:24:07] and god is obligated to do his spar
[1:24:10] you're responsible to god to do what
[1:24:12] you're supposed to do

[1:24:35] even as what
[1:24:37] love the church and what
[1:24:41] now that's why you don't mind being
[1:24:42] subject into everything because he loves
[1:24:45] you so much
[1:24:48] are you with me
[1:24:49] because of the love he's shown towards
[1:24:51] you you ought to
[1:24:53] willingly be subject to him because he
[1:24:56] loves you so much

[1:26:07] standing in the pulpit preaching and
[1:26:09] everything

[1:26:14] they say this abomination in the sight
[1:26:15] of god for woman the way that which
