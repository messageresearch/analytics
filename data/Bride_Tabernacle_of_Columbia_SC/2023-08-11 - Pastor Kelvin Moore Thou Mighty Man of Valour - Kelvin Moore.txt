thank the Lord for the joy of the Lord is your strength amen you thank the Lord amen giving us strength again amen Hallelujah sometimes we have to just try to tell God how much we love him and how much we thank him and every time we come into the house of the Lord we ought to be happy to be here amen and that's showing that we fulfill what the word says I was glad when he said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord if we believe that then we glad we don't believe it then we're not we're sad but if he believed the word amen we're glad to be in the house of the Lord amen thank God for everyone thank God for uh Brother Moore being with us and Sister Moore we're glad to have her back with us tonight amen brother uh um and his son Nick those are supposed to be with us tonight and I said they got to go back to Charlotte in the morning and fly out tomorrow so I says well that seemed to be a bit much I was trying to get him to go down to marlins come here and then that seemed to be too much going and I know and I told Brother Nick I said that's all right he sounds so tired I said well he's okay okay next year next year I said okay next year so by the grace of God we thank you for coming tonight and we trust that Brother Moore he said he was be in town so I said well when you speak for us tonight amen so we're glad to have uh Brother Moore with us tonight God is good amen God knows what we need and now what we need it amen so we thank God for you pressing your way Amen Let us just stand tonight the Revival is not over the tent is still up we might have to go back under the tent is still up taking everything down and praise God I met some fellows and they said they'd go around and do Street Ministry and I I said I better pray about it because they try to you know minister to gain members and all and I said well I don't know and looked like they came from the game too and I said well I better hesitate man y'all come on over here the tent's still up administer the game and uh but they seem to be stirred for the Lord and all of that but I said let me just pray about that you know you don't want to rush into something the city is going to come out the church we just pray God let him come out and visit with us and see where that they're going amen just pray for them and you seem to be really stirred for the Lord amen so by the grace of God they gave me a card and they Minister on the internet and all of that stuff like that but they stay in the neighborhood not far from me so by the grace of God we'll see how the Lord lead tonight let us just sing Amazing Grace greet somebody I I mean covert is over is for us greet somebody say God bless you brother sister glad to be in the house of the Lord it's great somebody amen I didn't say go all over the place [Music] that's good enough baby it's great so much we still we're still being a little watchful praise God are y'all with me thank the Lord amen God is good amen [Music] as we stream uh brother Kevin Moore from Elizabeth City North Carolina let's receive him in Jesus Christ's name with the song Amazing Grace [Music] thank you [Music] learn now foreign [Music] Amazing Grace amen you can be seated just for a moment it's just good to be in the house of the Lord good to see you all amen it's hasn't been that long since I've been here but thanking God that He gave us an opportunity to come back and uh as a brother Henry was saying my wife and I was up in Charlotte and my son and his family and I think when I was here before I was talking about my granddaughter who was soon to come or she's eight months old now and so I refuse to be an absentee grandfather so they probably gonna see me more than what they might want to but I have a reason to go there every time I go there it's only an hour and a half to Colombia so I've been getting in some fellowship and uh spending time see I believe that as a Christian grandfather I need to have my hands on my grandchild I need to be able to pour something into her and if I don't do that then how can I really be demonstrating that I'm concerned how can I really be demonstrating what the love of God is see God is a family man he is concerned and so I'm concerned and I will be there and so I've been getting around doing a lot of visiting because I'm going to go see my granddaughter so tonight I just thank the Lord there was a song that was um requested and I tell you it's been a minute since I sang that song matter of fact probably the last time I sang it was here um so I might excuse me I might need a sip of this to try to help me do it amen how many know that when we are in Christ if our mind is not made up it's not a good place to be because the Bible it lets me know very plainly that a double-minded man is unstable and not some of his ways but it said in all of his ways all is inclusive it doesn't leave anything out so you might think that well I can be shaky in Christ but I'm solid on my job now you're fooling yourself because you're unstable in all of your ways if your mind is not made up and I just believe that because that's what the word said all right a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and it said let him think not that he receiveth anything from the Lord whoo I don't think somebody believed that's in there bro but it's in there and so I don't want to be shaky when it comes to my faith I wouldn't want my wife to be shaky concerning my love that I have for her same relationship one is just natural the other one is spiritual I want the Lord to know that I love him because I know that he loved me why because he went to the cross and died in my place he who knew no sin became sin and and there is no greater love that a man could give than that he would lay down his life so he already did his part he showed us how much he loved us and now when we have opportunities like this to come together to lift him up we shouldn't hold back on our praise right we should not deny him any of the gifts that you have [Music] all to him I owe amen so it's all right if I take this down pray for me amen I'm thank the Lord for having my wife with me amen more than just to help me she's part of me and so I appreciate her support sometime running up and down the road so I appreciate her for Daddy with me of my mind with a me of mine there's no trials that he can get me through I'm not worried about what other people say or do I Got Heaven My Views [Music] with the maid of me a made of my I've gotta make up mine every day I can't say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and if it calls all of my life I am willing to pay [Music] I've Got Heaven name my view that I I have to walk alone [Music] all my family and friends they're all gone worry about [Music] what other people say or do I die [Music] [Music] of mine every day I can't say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and if it comes [Music] my view one more time and no we're the main A Madea made of my eyes [Music] [Music] I've Got Heaven [Music] in My Views amen God bless you you stand to your feet with us amen can we give the Lord a clap offering tonight amen can we loosen up a little bit amen praise the Lord where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen I I don't know maybe you were looking forward to somebody else speaking tonight that's all right the Holy Ghost is going to speak amen I don't think we had a flyer saying who was going to be here but the Holy Ghost is here because the Lord promised that where two or three are gathered in his name that he would be in the midst and that is who we come to praise tonight amen we came to praise the name of Jesus Amen let's bow our heads before we read the word amen I'm already blessed and just having an opportunity father Lord we come one more time Lord so humbly and reverently before the throne of grace Lord we come because you bid us to come Lord and we have accepted the invitation Lord and now may we give all that we have unto you Lord for this a lot of time Lord for you gave it all for us back on calvary's Cross Lord and us being here tonight is just a reasonable service you didn't ask us to do anything Supernatural or but to come and not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together in the house of the Lord so we are here tonight and we come to lift up your name for you said if you be lifted up you would draw all men unto yourself so we lift you up tonight may you be glorified and we pray that the people of God will be edified by the preaching of the word this is our prayer in Jesus name amen God bless you will you turn with me to the Book of Judges chapter 6. and God bless you musicians we thank you good to see you brother Jeremiah and other ministers brother legit amen I believe his brother Carl amen good to see him amen thank the Lord for pastor Simmons extending an invitation once again for us to be here amen I don't know about you but once upon a time on a Friday night all right Church might have been the furthest thing from my mind I'm old now but I still remember when my priorities were not what they are now and so I can't look down on anybody who does not have that same priority but if you saw fit to come why don't we get something out of it amen and we're only going to get out what we put in amen so judges six and let's uh we're going to read the first five verses and then we'll allow you to have your seat and the Bible says and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Midian seven years and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds strong holes from the enemy and so it was when Israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east east even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the Earth till Thou come unto Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it father may you add a blessing we pray to the word that has been read and that blessing that we desire tonight is that you will give us understanding according to your word for we pray this in Jesus name amen you can be seated the scripture may be familiar to many um you know but I just see so many parallels when I read this particular passage of scripture with the children of Israel being the chosen the elect of God chosen for a purpose but yet the enemy was on that trail so much so that they began to hide themselves and fortify themselves in caves and strongholds now in their mind it was a stronghold from the enemy but I'm here to show you that at some point in time it became a stronghold of the enemy see we think sometimes that we can hide and fortify ourselves from our situation when many times what we got to do is face it see we are not ordained to run from the devil that's an old Pentecostal song we used to sing I beat the devil running and I'm so glad you shouldn't have been running in the first place you should run to Jesus hold your peace and let the Lord fight your battle so what they were looking at as a stronghold from the enemy became a stronghold of the enemy why because this didn't just happen one time it said every time they plant it they cultivated the field they took in a harvest that the midianites and the amalekites will come up and take it if that is not the nature of Satan then tell me what it is for the enemy come if not now the groups that I just identified are enemies our enemy is the adversary Satan the devil and the Bible says the enemy cometh not the thief come if not but for to still kill and to destroy that's the only reason why it comes amen he don't come to patch you on the back until you doing well he don't come to tell you that the Lord is with you he'll tell you just the opposite God ain't with you that's why every year we come up here and take everything you got so much that they left them no sustenance in other words no way to sustain themselves no crops no sheep nothing see depression and oppression is two different things right and oppressed people are oppressed by an outside force but when that outside force is pounding on you and you get withdrawn then you can suffer from depression that comes from within can't nobody make you depressed you allow a situation to come and bring about depression and depression is a spirit of the enemy and that's listen that spirit is strong and it's prevalent in the land today and let me let me show you how even the enemy has tapped in to to our awareness of it everywhere you go now you look you'll see Billboards talking about Mental Health everywhere you go and yes it is a reality that people struggle with mental health but listen some of these things become strongholds that we have built from the enemy rather than facing it let's let's skip down for a minute I'm going to get to something what I want to talk to you about tonight is thou Mighty Man of Valor and when he said thou Mighty Man of Valley ain't just talking about the brothers we are all mankind sister you talking to you too listen if if a lot of brothers would be honest sometimes our wives can be more spiritual than we are right especially if she's blessed enough hear what I'm saying if she is blessed enough to be home taking care of her children praying for you and you out rubbing shoulders with the world all day on the job they have a tendency to be more spiritual than we are because we're trying to figure out how listen here's what she's going to focus on what is very immediate the immediate needs of the family a good father is trying to look down the road well I know in two years that boy gonna be ready to go to college how are we going to pay for it the whole car we got ain't gonna last too long sooner or later I'm gonna have to go get in he's trying to figure out how you're going to pay for it he looking down the road but when she dealing with his immediate take that thing and get the oil change the light came on in my car she dealing with what is very immediate but if she had the benefit of being able to do that many times they are more spiritual than we are and you might not want to admit it but it's okay because it's just true I I spoke to um I was speaking to someone the other day oh just yesterday we were in the store and uh we were with a sister um who was visiting and fellowshipping with my wife and I told her you know when you even when you look back on the old church when you looked at the population in the church as it is indicative tonight there is far more women in here than men far more right what does that speak to why is that many times more spiritual more in tune right and we focus on something everything but what we should be focused on sometimes it wouldn't be much of a church if you want for the Sisters the prophet said that the success of his meetings was three or four little ladies that was back home praying for him he traveling all around the world preaching the gospel so sisters Your Role is so vital so important to the church to the the continuation of the church or never let nobody make you feel like you're unimportant I thank God for my wife when I used to work 12 and 14 hours a day six and seven days a week and come in and she would have an atmosphere set in the house and just wash all of that filth off of me wow because I came into an atmosphere that was a holy ghost-filled atmosphere what a blessing go down with me to verse 11. so I'm gonna I'm gonna read a little bit about a man named Gideon many stories could be told about Gideon right but there is a point that I want to point out as we're reading this even in the salutation that he was greeted with verse 11 says now he he's dealing with this yearly attack of the enemy taking away what they have okay now watch what the scripture says and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in ofra that pertained unto joash the abaya's right and his son Gideon now I want you to pay particular attention and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press does that sound logical wine presses where you make wine The Wine Press is not where you thresh wheat he did it for a reason he threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites so he had to come up with some kind of strategy some kind of way to thwart the enemy some kind of way to hide away something to sustain the people and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor now I used to read this and I was like why would he be called a a man of Valor and he out hiding but he had a purpose for hiding he had a purpose for doing what he was doing on and in my mind and in the minds of many people you might think of him less because why didn't he just go confront the enemy why didn't he get some troops together and go out and see listen this is the point that I wanted to point out here that in Gideon's Behavior we might think that he was out of place and out of position you don't dress wheat or at the wine press you thresh wheat on the threshing floor and the threshing floor has great significance it's where the seed is separated from the shuck oh very similar to what goes on in the church setting because when you come to church everybody might be dressed the same everybody might sing but sometimes the seed is being separated from the shut right in here so the threshing floor is very significant so it might appear that Gideon was someone out of place threshing wheat on at the wine press and so the point that I was trying to bring out was listen sometimes Everything Is Not What It appears to be because when I first started reading this and and reading I'm not talking about reading an old instant Revelation you know like some people um as soon as you re oh I got it um sometimes you gotta go back and read things over and over again until the Lord acquitting it to you right so initially reading it I said man he's hiding but the salutation that he was greeted with he was called a mighty man of Valor and it was all because what God saw in him you know about two months ago um we did a thing in Elizabeth City we we do this routinely they're teachers and principals they'll call and they'll reached out to um pastors and ministers in the community and they say hey we're going to have a lockdown tonight so what a lockdown consists of is a bunch of middle school maybe 13 to 15 year old or 12 to 15 year old boys and all of them troubled youth all of them are well known in the principal's office all of them have behavior issues or whatever the case might be and so we come and we sit them down in an environment with some structure right they don't come in and run wild though that's what their nature is they want to just take all oh we want to go play nope wait wait we're going to sit down and we're going to give you some structure we're going to tell you what the agenda is what we're going to do tonight what what the objective is it's never just to let you come and run wild the objective is for all these men who have sacrificed their time to come and speak to you and interact with you to have an opportunity to deposit something in you positively so there was one young boy um when we were talking to him we were addressing them as young men and I guess he had heard that phrase one time too many and he said why y'all keep calling me a young man I'm a boy I said well that's kind of different a lot of them you know want to be acknowledged as a man but he recognized where he was now why y'all keep calling me a young man I'm a boy I'm not a man I said what I'm talking to is the potential that's in you if you keep living one day you will obtain the chronological age to be a man but we want to put some in you to make sure that you are a man there are 25 and 30 year olds that still behave like boys they don't always equate to a number 18 you can go to war and die for your country but I don't even think they can uh buy a can of beer or whatever at 18. but you can go die for your so the numbers don't always add up right right so we got to meet them where they are and try to help them see the potential that is in themselves if you listen if you've been told all your life you ain't never going to be nothing unless there's somebody who comes and shows a different scene right you are very subject to produce the seed that has been planted words are seeds the seed is the word of God and and one thing I will say I really appreciate the the school superintendent because when he allows us to have functions they don't say don't pray in Jesus name he have never said that a lot of school systems around America will forbid you from doing that they had three young people that died in the Middle School right in the school and they called a hawk and allowed us to use the whole football stadium and every Minister who was there was given the opportunity to pray and not once did they say don't pray in Jesus name we don't want you to offend somebody so I respect that man um more than any school administrator I have ever met because he's doing that at a cost his bosses could really confront him about that and create a problem but what happened he understand that there's a need and if we don't do something to unlock the potential in these young folks you have very few opportunities to impact what's going on in your own community and so guess what I want to try to do tonight unlock the potential that is in some of these Believers that's in here right now so listen when I was a young man um I was hard-headed my grandmother said that boy is sneaky and she knew exactly what she was talking about and I had an uncle that would often say and he wouldn't say it to me directly but I always hear it that boy ain't gonna never be nothing no he never won't be nothing and and the more that I heard that it really hardened something in me to say I'm going to show him that I am going to be something so I did not allow that seed to Trump to see that my mama was telling me listen brothers and sisters I'm gonna read something that I wrote down so we find ourselves living in a time when people are more concerned what others say about them than what God said about them people put more stock and more confidence in a rumor in what somebody said on Facebook or Tick Tock or Instagram more concerned with what somebody said on there than what your mom and daddy told you you can be anything you want to be so to flip it to the spiritual side we can do all things through Christ [Applause] that potential is there but it needs to be unlocked and the way is the way that it gets unlocked is you got to believe it I tell my little congregation back at home it does me no good to stand and preach and pour my heart out of nobody ain't gonna receive it ain't nobody gonna try to live it what good would it do and I'm not one of those preachers who said I've heard this all my life I don't care if everybody leaves I'll preach to the pews where I ain't got there yet I ain't got that Revelation yet I know God is able of these stones to raise up children of Abraham but I don't see many preachers out preaching to no stones they want somebody that can hear the word to be able to receive the word and then manifest the word see when you plant a seed ground you expectation that is going to grow and it's going to Bear forth whatever type of fruit it is and if you go through that process of tilling the soil and fertilizing and planting and all of that and you don't see anything come up you're going to be discouraged and the whole world Brothers had been preached to the message and going around the world who knows how many times right so the field has already been sown what we're looking for now is manifestation the whole creation is groaning and waiting travailing waiting for what us to manifest to manifest Christ for somebody to be able to say one day you know man well the more man he's he's kind of I don't really know I don't really like them but one thing I can say he's been with Christ that's what they said about this like the disciples they perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned men but yet they had to take knowledge that there's something about that Christ they've been hanging around with the things that he preached over the pulpit they starting to live it I see what he said oh the word becomes flesh watch my scripture I I never used to say I had a favorite scripture right but one of the scriptures that means the most to me and it was what reason I named my church what I did is in Saint John 1 and 14 right we know up one and one says in the beginning was the word and the Word was flesh and the word I mean the Word was God and but then you go down to verse 14 is the verse that I really want to highlight and it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us right so guess what brother and sisters so Jesus's whole life whole Ministry was to do one thing fulfill scripture so if the word had to be made flesh in him how do we how do we we're going to escape somebody ought to be able to see Christ in you that men might see your good works and glorify the father and have what are they saying they're saying attributes of Christ on display and in manifesting time just because Gideon was hiding it's not always what you see I remember a time when I thought and I would even say this even after I had accepted Christ um man I was on my way to hell no I won't because look if I am a Son of God I always was but what was happening I was walking after the course of this world and so people were judging me based on what they saw and I didn't have enough confidence in myself to know and believe that wait a minute if I am if I ever was a Son of God I always was and the Lord saw me when I was out there on the street saw me doing things and I would be ashamed to even repeat but do I believe or not that he said I was chosen in him before the foundation of the world before I did any of those old slave will be held you know when I used to share my testimony with my own family they couldn't believe it said not not you Calvin you you never did it I said oh yeah I did that they couldn't believe it but when sin gets a hold of you brother and sister you won't have any clue The Depths that it can take you to you don't have you don't have a clue you you might say oh I would never do that oh my child would never do that well until they've been born again don't don't put any limits on it no they'll only go this far every time I came close to the line that my mama told me not to cross I heard her voice but guess what there came a point in time when I heard what she said and I stepped over that line and I paid for it because the enemy will take you so far that you can't even find your way back and you would do things that you never do you think that prodigal son ever imagined in his wildest dreams that he would be in the Hog Pen eating the slop with the hog do you think he ever thought he would get there when he asked his daddy daddy just give me my inheritance now and just let me go do you think that he thought that was going to be the outcome no he didn't he just wanted to go out and enjoy his life riotous living and I heard somebody say a fool in his money soon Departed you hear all the time all these I was standing in the store trying to get a cup of coffee out when I finished fishing I stopped to the store and I get a cup of coffee for my ride home and the lie was so long and I'm trying to figure out why the line was sold everybody trying to hit the Powerball everybody trying to get lucky and I said man this just the time and energy right one lady she had a stack of tickets man about as thick as a uh you remember the little New Testament Bibles she had a little new she had that many tickets and so thick I said she gonna throw away a whole bunch of money and somebody in Florida I heard won the money so all that money she's spending and everybody else who was in line look how we put our hopes in things right when all my hope is in the Lord that's the only hope that I have is in Christ apart from that I'm lost so Gideon though his outward appearance may have seemed that he was not even fit to be called a mighty man of Valor God knew what was in Gideon and later on he became a tool in the hands of God to tear down Satan's kingdom The Groves and all those things where they worship idols and when it was done the Elder said Gideon have done this thing why because even though some might have thought he want nothing there were some people who saw something in that boy see if you can't when Jesus went to the uh Temple the Bible says as his custom was and he picked up the scroll forward to read do you know what he turned to he turned to the prophecy of Isaiah that was speaking concerning himself you need to find your scriptural identification if we just read the Bible as a novel you're going to miss it so many people take an undertaking and they there's programs that you can have on your phone or your tablet and it'll help you it'll structure you how to read the whole Bible in a year all right and it's not there's nothing wrong with that right it's it's a good undertaking to read it but if you I had people who talk to me I used to minister into prison for like seven years he said man I never read that book about seven times I said so you read it seven times but it haven't changed you are you reading it like you're reading a novel you doing a rerun like they do with TV shows and movies it ain't had no effect on you but the word says here a little there a little line upon line and preacher you never caught the precept you never caught the mind of God because you were reading a book and when you got the Genesis and it was about eight 18 or 20 pages of Hebrew got this one and maybe got that one you got stuck right there everything that you had read previously you kind of lost the meaning well what is the significance of this that's not the way the Bible is intended to be read there's nothing wrong with it at least you're reading it but you need and all you'll get and you need to get an understanding when the Lord sent Philip and joined him to the eunuchs Chariot the first question he asked him was understand is thou what thou readest he said how can I accept some man come and help me come and show me so we got a purpose help somebody else what's your testimony and it don't have to be a spotlight or you could you can testify about how your candle got lit the song says This Little Light of Mine you think everybody think they gotta have a strobe light like they got a used car sale shining across the sky no if if you cut every light off in here and I turn This little light on on my cell phone I can find my way right out that door with a little light but the little light that we have if we take it and we hide it who are we going to help who are we going to benefit turn with me real quick I'm gonna read another scripture sometimes you know self-doubt is a powerful tool of the enemy and sometimes as I said that seed was planted by someone responsible for nurturing a child boy you just like your daddy you want no good instead of planting a different seed and nurturing it and and helping it grow right pruning it sometime when it needed to be pruned I got a rose bush in my yard and it I never really took care of it like I should have but when I start taking care of it man I've never seen so many beautiful roses show up why because it had to be tended to people looking for their Ministry what should I be doing Lord show me what you want me to do and you got four children that don't even know nothing about yes Jesus loved me you talking about a Ministry the age of ministry right there that's how the Lord won me with my children my baby boy used to stand beside me and when I shaved he wanted to shave I had my boom box on and I knew every word to the rap song and next thing I know he knew every word and the Lord convicted my heart one night and said he know every word to that song but he don't know nothing about yes Jesus loves me whose fault was that it was my fault I'm I'm cultivating the wrong seed I'm I'm demonstrating the wrong Behavior right before my son and the Lord used that to convict my heart and that began me pursuing all right Lord what can I do to change and I had to lift up my hands and surrender turn with me to Exodus 14. right we're in the Third Exodus and we know Exodus is in two parts it's not just coming out yeah I came out of the world but now it's time to come into not and not just in the church either it's time to come into Christ because we came out we came in and now we're gonna go up that's what I'm looking forward to Exodus 14. to get in knew Harvest after harvest the midianites the Malachi's they were coming so slowly he devised a plan on how to preserve life hold back something that they can't come and just take everything see if the enemy had his way he'll come take everything from you and even if the Lord allowed like he allowed with job he said yeah I'll let you touch them but just don't you can't have his life but job was learning patience and I read a quote the other night it said Faith Waits with patience for the Fulfillment of the promised word we if we've been given a promise patiently wait for it not get discouraged when oh I've been praying for that boy for five years oh my husband still ain't say oh I don't know whatever the occasion may be you feeling the blank whatever it is you praying for and it seemed like it's tarrying remember Faith ways with patience for the Fulfillment of the promised worry and you can encourage yourself with that so Lord I seen you do it there was a sister used to come to the church believe in God and her husband was going to get saved she would put her pocketbook right beside her and if somebody tried to sit there and say no don't sit there you're gonna sit on my husband what's wrong with her don't sit there you're gonna sit on my husband that's a by faith she was claiming that she saw and she waited with patience guess what he is now he's a deacon he was a song leader she waited Faith had us stand right there not running hard in the cave testify to what you believe if you said Lord you promised me my children hold on to that I don't care how Wayward they might sing but people that know me from back in the day as they say they will testify for me I said man I can tell you I can tell you when he changed he was out there with us he was doing everything we were doing I mean everything and then some but first thing happened he met that girl then we stopped seeing them we didn't see him that much then we got married then we decided to go to church and he said man I'm telling you I just knew he was coming back but he ain't never come back foreign If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away and guess what he said I like using this word oh things become new well I'm still I'm a work in progress and I heard that about 10 times this week and it's still fresh in my mind I'm a work in progress let me tell you how you translate that man I'm still slipping still I still need to be delivered that's what they're telling you I'm a working man we all work in progress but guess what the work has been finished in Christ when he gave up the ghost whole pantry what we're waiting for now is the changing of these bodies I was talking to one of brother gives old Deacon um and we were just encouraging each other and he said he said bro I'm gonna tell you what it's like right now he said it's like a father that take his children to school and drop them off in the morning he know how long they're going to be there right they even have an expectation of how long they're going to be there but they know at the end of the day daddy's coming to get me he said that's where the church is right now he said the Lord allowed us to come here right to be tempted and tried he dropped us off at school to learn something and we just waiting for Daddy to pull up so Lord come get us out of this mess that we're in and I'll tell you sometime you want to cry out what the scripture said even so come Lord Jesus but now you won't you won't make that plea and that declaration if you're double-minded no Lord give me a little bit more time but if you know that all is well you'll say even so come Lord Jesus this see we need to know when the Bible man my testimony is I guess I should have just said I won't testify out tonight um when I began reading the Bible as a new born babe in Christ and reading it diligently when I came across the scripture in Saint John 5 that said search the scriptures for yourself and then the next part it said for in them you think eternal life and I told my wife this I said it was like the word think got magnified on the page search is good for us for in them I think Lord I don't want to think I have it I want to know so how do I know I got a social scripture for myself I gotta let the Lord reveal to me that who I am and sometimes I think we still question and doubt self-doubt who we are we are the sons and daughters of almighty God and I heard the prophet saying you can know if you got the Holy Ghost you can no more darling God can die oh man you said well people dying all the time man Christians don't doubt we just sleep he said well you they bury you in the ground they put this shell in the ground but I'm not I'm not there I stood over my mama's casket and at her funeral and a bunch of Bishops and uh you know everybody was there and I just shared what was on my heart I said my mama is not in that box my mama loved the Lord she was saved born again so yes I miss her but man I'm when she died I kissed her and I said Mama see you later I didn't say goodbye see you later for there is hope of a tree if it died I shall it live again she never died she just went to sleep and sometimes we if we don't know who we are we will live so far beneath our privileges over in Kuwait in the Middle East right the the real kuwaitis they don't work the real kuwaitis don't work they are living off of the royalties from all that oil in that country so they don't even work so because they know who they are do you think they're worried about where their next meal is coming from man that oil is pumping every day they turn it on and off when they want to and when they turn it off and they start getting low that's when you see your gas prices go up it's a direct correlation what do you think they worrying about where next week's meal is coming from no I'm a Kuwaiti Mama we got oil man I'm good to go if they can have that type of confidence in who they are see we sent we sent probably from the shipyard probably 240 workers to Kuwait so the the reason I know these things oh my God you come back and tell me he said man they don't even he said there's a street that's called Gold Street I'm serious they said every night they said they it's it's locked up but they don't have a bunch of security he said because if you get caught stealing with Kuwait they'll cut your hand off and he said the goal is not the goal that you find around here he said the gold is so bright it's not a a bright shine if you walk down the street you think it's lights and it's not lights he said just the Moonlight can strike it and Glory somebody out on the street trying to sell you some gold and it's so bright and shiny you better be careful it ain't real look at them clips if you see a gap in one of them Clips up nope don't give up I've been caught that way that's why I know that right now I don't buy stuff like that no more but I ran them down and I got my money back Exodus 14 let's go to verse 12. so I like God likes to remind us of what he said watch what verse 12 says it says is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us along that we may serve the Egyptian see Egypt types the world and some people when they were in the world they were comfortable just leave us alone here's the analogy that I use right so used to work third shift sometime well six in the evening to 6 30 in the morning and so in the daytime was when you had to try to get some sleep and so you go in the room and you try to make it as dark as possible right as soon as you go in there and you got small children next thing you know somebody open that door we'll turn the light on right and because you are comfortable in the darkness the first thing you say is cut off that light so guess what the Bible says about that it said men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds are wicked light will and so here you come trying to witness to somebody you come with all this light the word is light and they they turn you down you know what they're saying turn that light off I'm comfortable in my sin it's not just the word that we do tell thee let us alone own that we may serve the Egyptian for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness I heard the scripture say well you know once upon a time it seemed like we had more when we poured out drinks to Diana the false god seemed like we were prospering more but now that I sought my heart to follow the one true God man everything is against me that's a good sign it's a good sign the Bible warns us beware when all men speak well of you what is that saying I mean you compromising somewhere because you talking to a whole lot of people don't agree with you beware so on my job you know my cousin used to work in the trouble there so everybody have problem with your computer the majority of them knew my cousin she was one of the lead texts in there and so when they would come invariably she would say oh do you know Kelvin oh yeah I know him he's a nice guy oh I know him yeah he's a good man uh whatever she said everybody have something good to say I said no you just ain't got the right ones in there yet but when she said that it made me think be careful when all men speak well of you why either you ain't standing for nothing and they say oh man he's easy anything you know he'll let you go or whatever the case might be careful right man when you're trying to do the will of the Lord for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction when you trying to go this way the enemy is trying to push you back well they say you will never be nothing my uncle said I would never be nothing and that really made me determined to prove them wrong all right let me let me read this it's a verse 13. and Moses said unto the people fear ye not why why are we sometimes afraid to step out on the word why are we afraid to hold on to the promise we should not be right listen perfect love casts out all fear and when we have it our our faith is not made perfect in love so why are we fearful so he said fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today somebody might be battling something right now the Lord can show you today that that stronghold that you built or that you allow the enemy to build to keep you fixed in or hidden in a cave it's the enemy but watch what he said here for the Egyptians whom you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever see these are the things that I'm trying to besides that we hold on to what God Said not what the world said for example in a Narcotics Anonymous well you always going to be an addict or you always going to be an alcoholic man that the devil is a liar if the Lord delivered me I am not I'm not alcoholic no more but what are they doing when they're telling you that psychologically they playing games with you but what they're doing is giving you room to say I relapse when the when total surrender will bring total Deliverance ask me how I know smoking drink every day the good Lord sent but when the Lord delivered me I never had a desire to go back once it's not about relapse it's about being delivered and see when you entertain that Spirit it has every right to stay right there I was talking to a young man last week and he going through some issues and I said listen man have you ever thought about a government job and I already knew what was going on and he was honest matter of fact he wasn't just a young man it was my uncle my nephew he said uh I ain't got one problem I smoke too much so you can't stop long enough to pass the test to give a sample and get a job then guess what you don't need no job there are so many good jobs out today covet messed people up getting free money checks and people will stand outside in front of a store with a sign and the sign behind them says help wanted now it's a hundred degrees outside you got bottles of water on the ground they hot you'll stand out there and hold a sign but you could go in McDonald's whereas cool they're gonna pay 15 an hour and you can get some benefits but you rather stand there and hold a sign no you don't want to work ain't no need to asking me for my money I worked 31 years to get this retirement if you want to stand here right outside the building that's hiring I mean they got ads everywhere Amtrak hiring Mercedes-Benz plants down here in South Carolina 30 something dollars an hour people still standing out holding signs man I don't care what I was on I try to quit long enough to get a job no way in the world I got too much pride they'll see a lady coming in the store and say miss you got any chance what kind of man can allow yourself to stoop so low to ask a woman for some change come on man but that's how low sin will take you right I'm just here to tell you um we we should not live beneath our privileges and everything ain't always what you see it seemed like Gideon was fearful but no Gideon was being used by God so that the enemy didn't get all the bread something to sustain the people and when God used him he went and tore down those Groves where they worship idols and the Lord began to strengthen them amen so whatever it is in your life right let the Lord tear it down let them tear it down so that he can use you for if it's no more than sharing your testimony I was telling the brother his testimony the other night blessed me it was it was part of my story I've been through the same thing but when the Lord delivered me I never had a desire to go back they took Christ to get me to that point but once he delivered me I never had a desire to go back amen and if you are here tonight and you holding on to something if you're allowed the enemy to build a stronghold in your mind you can be set free tonight right because we're the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but you got to get sick and tired of being sick and tired well you got to get sick and tired of being in that same ruts don't know whether you're going backwards or forward that's how when you're in a rut you're spinning wheels the only way you get out of that hole you got to elevate and put something solid underneath it or either somebody come pull you out but guess what oh my goodness they can't when they come to pull you out they're not gonna get down in the ditch with you you know that's what that's what's happening right out in these nominal churches oh well the young people need gospel rap no they don't they need the same thing that save you they need the word and it needs some examples how foolish would I look I got a record you in the ditch and I'm going back down into this with you now we both stuck no somebody need to stay up on Solid Ground Solid Ground is on the word amen so if we stand on this right then we can help somebody we stand on the word we can help ourselves apply the word to your life apply the word to your situation and that's not just a cliche um but you the word will work all this other stuff they're trying try this try that you know doctors practice medicine you ever thought about that why I go to somebody and pay them and give them your insurance card and they practicing oh I want to go to you after you got it right not after you but we know that the word works it's not something that we practice it's something that we'll believe in something we allow the Lord to use to correct our situation one thing about correction let's stand to our feet you know I um so when my when my uncle used to always say I won't gonna be nobody you know when I retired from the shipyard and at 31 years there was only one person hired in me in my department there were there were times when I had to give briefings to the chief of Naval operations it looked like we was having a senate hearing they on one side of the table I'm on the other side of the table all these microphones um there were people in Washington DC when we had trouble in Seattle they were getting ready to shut all the work down and they said well who do y'all have there they said we got Mr Morty okay you can continue but my uncle said I want to never be nothing I told my brother I'm a writer but what you gotta write a book about I said have you ever talked to Colin Powell have you ever talked to the chief of Naval operation have you ever been compared to the man told me you belong in DC with Colin Powell Mr Moore because you got me motivated so what you mean what I got to write a book about if I tell somebody how I got saved I can write a book about that the Lord brought me out of those streets from Philadelphia to Portsmouth Virginia to North Carolina he saved me took me out of that old life and gave me a new life and on Friday night tonight I'm in church trying to encourage somebody amen God bless you anyone here tonight and I'm I'm serious um if you have anything that's kind of got you boxed in or something that's holding you in one place right if you desire to be delivered Deliverance is here if you sink and you trusting in the doctor right that's okay dollars have their place right all right Mama I go to the doctor and I try to do what they tell me when I go but why I come to church right the great physician is here but not do what he wants you to do for your situation but if anybody desires prayer tonight we will pray with you um and God is still in the delivering business you're still in the healing business he's still saving if you need to be saved and we will pray with you tonight it's not as deep and complicated as people try to make it right but people say oh confess with your mom believe in your heart you'll be saved yeah that's true but when it's real it'll it'll start to have an effect but the devil believes and trembles at the word right but I ain't looking to see him in the rapture so you know people say oh you gotta do is believe oh yeah well your belief will be manifested through your life and your confession has the ability to bring even your body under subjection to the word of God Amen so let's just buy our heads and if anyone desires prayer the altar is open I'm sure um and the pastor and there are ministers here we will pray with you because God is able to do exceeding and abundantly above all that we can ask or even think father God we just come to the close Lord of this service but Lord we would not want to hinder anyone Lord that desires prayer for we be more than happy to pray with them for we know that your spirit is here Lord and where the spirit is Lord there is liberty liberty is freedom if you desire to be free from bondage you can be free tonight Lord many times we know that the greatest battle that has ever been fought is in our own mind Lord so as we endure those mind battles Lord we need to think on you for you say you will keep them in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon thee many don't have peace many don't have rest Lord but you can give them rest for you say take my yoke upon you and learn of me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light we thank you Lord for the attention of the Saints tonight Lord and for our friend Pastor Simmons Lord that just gave us the opportunity Lord to encourage the people may you continue to bless his Endeavors Lord his ministry Lord the great Tent Revival Lord God that has I know been a blessing to so many continue to give him strength Lord for there is much work that goes into those type of services Lord but I know that you will sustain them so Bless the people tonight Lord as we lord God come to this close pray that something has been said that will encourage them that would let them know that our only hope is
