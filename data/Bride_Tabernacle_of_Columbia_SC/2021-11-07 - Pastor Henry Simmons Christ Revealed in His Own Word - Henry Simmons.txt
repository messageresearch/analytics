lord that you've afforded us an opportunity to come back into your house for in your presence there's fullness of joy and at your right hand the pledges for evermore so father we thank you o god as we look to the heels now from which cometh our help lord there are many needs lord requests lord and father i ask you to meet every need every request lord for lord you are able o god told god to heal the sick to save the lost to restore the backslide or whatever the problems whatever the conditions are father you're more than able to meet every need according to your riches in glory so father we thank you today may you bless your word may you move flesh back out of the way lord god may you o god speak to the needs of your children in jesus wonderful name we pray amen hebrews 1 praise god and one god who in sun-dried times and in divers of different manners speak in time past until the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us by a son whom he has appointed heir of all things but whom also he made the world will be in the brightness of his glory the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purge our sins sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high god bless the religious words you may be seated god is good i was just praying i have several things that i would like to share with you today and hopefully they'll come out and try to duck tail together if they don't then they may god bless you okay we just want to speak some things that's on our heart it's we were praying about different things and in psalms 46 we noticed that we were saying that we will speak on christ revealing his own word this morning and then hebrews tell us god in sun-dried times in different manners speaking time fast to the fathers by the prophet has in these last days spoken at us by son so by the grace of god we know that the holy spirit amen is in the church today and god speaking through us through his son through the holy ghost so by the grace of god as we look at psalms 46 i want i chose for a sub-topic god is our refuge god is our refuge this morning and uh i may dwell more on one of the other god is our refuge he says god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in trouble god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in trouble the prophet of god says and christ revealed in his own word he's talking about that something that would help stabilize the people god would give god has given us something and he was talking about the word of god giving them something that would stabilize the people you see it becomes of the condition of the world and that's back then it was very neurotic time people are in such a nervous condition the world and then he says the statement is he says it said he was talking about the future that we'll be passing through on dangerous and treacherous waters we'll be passing through dangers dangers and treacherous waters in the midst of passing through dangers and treacherous waters we're going to need a refuge amen he said the plagues things that's going to hit the earth we're gonna be we're gonna need god he says because these vows he was talking about so by the grace of god we know that god is preparing his people amen for what the oncoming stone so god is preparing you and i to get out of here now whether we take advantage of the preparation that god has afforded us that's up to you and i but for those that signed crime because of the abomination done in the city those that would seek god no those would that would see the need of an urgency is in my spirit that uh that would take the word of god seriously see because a lot of folks are not serious about their soul salvation they're not serious about their walk with christ the bible says that we ought to take the most earnest he to the things which we've heard at least at any time we'll let him slip then he said how shall we escape who neglect so great in salvation god is looking for us to take them on get serious about going to heaven get serious get down to business amen we need to take take take your trip to heaven seriously and sometimes i think we don't take it our soul salvation serious we don't really get down to earnestly considering that i had a soul and that god one day you gonna say your soul is required of you have you conducted your life did you get ready for the time when god would judge the world in righteousness what about your life are you taking it serious are you just waking up and just going through not even considering how serious the journey is i hope you value your soul more than you value your house more than you value your job more than your value your future i hope you value your soul more than anything that this world has to offer because it's more valuable are you with me but seem as though we don't even value our lines that's why people are just shooting one another down that's why folks are throwing it away because they don't see any value any value in it if you don't see value you'll throw it away i mean you'll put it in the garbage can put it on the trash pile it has no value and some people are just trashing up their lives is it their value because they don't have no value they don't have no nothing no principle nothing their life ain't worth nothing they're smoking up their dope it up they're shooting it up they'll they don't care how they treat it this is like a individual in the natural don't care how they treat their bodies they'll fornicate they'll commit adultery they'll do anything and not they don't value it it's not nothing sacred about it nothing holy about they don't care this just do what you want with it it ain't no good anyway just do what you want ain't no good i said i value it i don't care how i look i don't care how it's only when when one is laying on the sickbed one is in a in a desperate situation and then they get to want to live and not die they begin to cry out somebody help me if god if you're there or do something then it becomes valuable but other than that we it has no value we just wake up in the morning i'm just here i don't even know why i'm here i'm just living i don't even know why i'm living i don't know where you i don't even have a purpose i don't even have a care i don't even have a purpose i don't even care one way or another live or die and that's what we're facing moses was telling me about the school house and uh that the children just gone wild crazy and you know then rachel was telling me about it and everybody's talking about the school it's just it's out of control so i know when we're in desperate times where people are unstable mentally tick-tock is taking advantage i don't even know what it is but y'all know what it is you know but by the grace of god we got to come down and get serious about god is your life of any importance and anything of value to you as a person do you care anything about your soul do you care anything about you do you want to be blessed do you want to prosper do you want to have value you know the dollar is losing its value everything is losing value see something that is valuable to you you hold it dear it's precious to you you know sometimes our marriages lose value sometimes you know our family loses value and sometimes the thing that we value god does not value sometimes we the things that we put in front of god sometimes the things that is more important to us than our soul then god looks down at it and god understands that you're putting things in front of me and you're valuing things more than you value me he said i'm a jealous god and i have no other god before me see sometimes we we think that god is god you're not important to me you're not valuable to me it's only when we need him is he valuable when we need him then he means something he's valuable he's important but as long as we don't need him he's of no value are you ready praise god the spare tire is not important till you get a flat are you with me but god is like a spare tire we don't need him until we get a flat are you with me and then you see the value of having this oh god don't don't do god like that because when you need him he may not be there for you why because amen you when he gave you the opportunity to serve him to worship him to trust him and to know him you didn't want him but when you need him you say well okay god come on you know it's like god is you know he's not look like a puppy on the string or something like that you can just do it like you wanna god is the one that made us amen not we ourselves so you can't do god any kind of way and expect god just to be there for you that's what the world doing well i you know i just party do any kind of crazy stuff and i said oh god thank you for being my god you know they give god no respect they give god no honor god is irrelevant he's not important but yet we say he's god do you believe in god i believe in god do you believe in jesus i believe my savior okay here david says god is i mean the song it says god is our refuge and our strength a very present help a very present help not just a health now he's a present help sometimes we think about the god of the past god of yesterday to every to most people god is a god of yesterday and not a god of the presence but you really must understand that god is a god present he's a present tense god and the bible tells us god is revealing his own word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god god was revealing himself in david as king and then solomon this peace he was revealing himself unto abraham as the father of the faith god was revealing himself with moses as a deliverer are you with me god reveals himself an elijah amen praise god he had as the one that restored the people back to the world god was in the prophets god was revealing himself in his own word throughout all ages christ was identif identified throughout all ages praise god but brother and sister we come down to a place in god that we need our own personal experience we must have our own personal experience not moses knew him as a deliverer and noah knew him as a as a savior that he was able to save him from the flood but god revealing himself to noah in that day and gave him a revelation what he was requiring in that day see when god reveals himself to you in his own word then he also gives you amen a revelation he gives you a refuge he gives you a place amen that you can go and hide so god gives us a safety place so it's very important that's why uh the bible says uh the name of the lord is the strong tower the righteous running thing in and they're safe see we need to be safe save from all in the school the children need to have a safe a place of safety i mean in a world that's full of chaos and darkness where can i find safety where can i find a place to hide i'm i'm talking about as dangerous as this world is getting we need a place of safety now let me go in the time it helped in trouble a very present help in trouble job talked about in job 14 a man that's born of a woman is a few days in full of what now if you don't have any troubles then maybe you weren't born of a woman children are have troubles and problems have difficulty have times where they don't even know you know they don't even know why they are trouble they don't know why they are feeling the way they feel sometimes they feel lonely sometimes they feel forsaken sometimes they feel like what is my purpose the answer is in god the answer is here for you but sometimes we don't want to end we don't really value we don't really want the true answer that god has given us god is our refuge and our strength a very present hell the very present help in trouble okay so i know i know about trouble and i know that we're facing troubled times and i know the world is in trouble praise god and i know you're going to run into trouble you might not want to face your trouble that's why sometimes we try to do things to escape trouble we try to do things to shape trouble but trouble is facing you every day when you wake up and look in the mirror you're looking at trouble when you look at your job trouble look at the school trouble look at the world trouble everywhere you look trouble but the option the place is saying god is our refuge in the time when we need strength god will give us strength in this presence the stress this present atmosphere that we're living in god will give us strength brother and sister we need strength strength to keep children out of prison the lines our minds to keep our hearts we need we need an anchor we need help we need help and he's got present help if we allow him to help us if we want help then i say give it to god brother give your heart to god give your life to god because he can help us but we don't want him to help us who's going to help us if god don't help us the president says you can't find help anywhere else amen you say well if i get this degree if i do this if i do that then i'll be all right no you need god that's the only help that we're going to security our refuge our safe place our security you want to be secured are you with me because you're not secure in any other way your job won't give you security and your money won't give you security amen you're not secured a refuge a place of safety a place where i can feel like i am safe i'm secured only in god and why why see sometimes the devil is just he just got a soul he got us so blinded so twisted up tangled up mixed up that we won't we don't want to hear we don't want to hear that we don't want to i don't wanna i'm not feeling it i i'm not gonna feel it though i don't care what you say i ain't feeling it i won't listen i'm not gonna let him in no no not me it ain't for me we put all kind of shields and all kind of protections all kind of things to stop god's word from penetrating our hearts and take oh god it's god our help comes from the lord but we'll do everything we can do to not we don't want him to help us because i don't believe he he can help me i don't want him to help me we do everything we can do praise god that god not help us you know sometimes we'll turn away from god for the last time and judgment is strike when you can see a young man laying on his bed paralyzed when he's just when you can see somebody that just lost it all and you look at them since they had the opportunity they had the opportunity but they didn't believe it they had the opportunity to go god's way but they didn't believe it let me say this in the next verse it says therefore will not we what therefore will we not fear men's hearts failing because of fear of the things that's coming on the earth therefore we would not fear brother and sister fear is gripping folk they don't know how to deal with the fear the fear of being alone a fear of anybody caring about me a fear of folks don't understand you a fear of losing family members fear of you know people are are so fearful today he said men hearts will fail because of fear and i believe we're living in a fearful time he says god is our refuge and our strength very present help in the time of trouble and he says therefore will therefore will not we fear are you with me but i'm going to tell you something if god is not your refuge you're living in fear you actually living in fear folks are being tormented they can't have peace because there's no future in this world there's nothing that you can look forward to that would relax you that would calm your nerves that would make you feel he meant that everything's going to be all right it doesn't matter how amen a politician says it's gonna be all right it's something not inside you you don't believe that but god will make it all right therefore we would not fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea things are happening earthquakes are happening every day things are happening throughout the earth that's causing fear to grip the haunted people they said it's global warming they said it's just that but i'm gonna tell you something because sin has increased because of nicotine abound and you wonder why the love of many hearts are going to whack squat cold people are cold-hearted that's why they can do such heinous crimes because they're cold-hearted because of nicotine about people know to do good and they won't do it know they'll they're doing wrong and they keep doing it i'm gonna tell you something we ain't a we're the time that we got to anchor our faith in god and trust him go to my mountains be carried in the midst of the sea and though the waters they'll roar and be troubled though the mountains be shake with the swelling there now he gives us confidence you see the volcano is erupting and this that all of that shaking with the swelling is there he says there is a what there is a river you know i'm so glad that there's a river there's a river of life springing up in me he said he that believeth on me as the scripture said then out of his belly shall flow what rivers of what there is a river i will not leave you comfortless he said amen praise god don't be afraid he says don't fear because i never leave you he said i'm a pr god is a refuge and strength a very present help in trouble until all these things are going on i never leave you i'll never forsake you i won't let you down hallelujah you know the world can be so penetrating that people can't bare they can't hold it why because i'm not gonna let you i'm gonna i'm not gonna let you in god i'm not gonna let sometimes folk think hey it's brother simmons i'm not gonna let brother simmons uh i'm not gonna let him get next to me sometimes they think the word is coming to the ministry just aiming at them you pick in on me i'm not gonna let you pick on me i was preaching in the youth prison one time and there was about a hundred soul children in the juvenile center and that's what i took somebody's place i usually preaching men and women but i took somebody's place for the juvenile and said will you replace me i said yeah it's you and as i was preaching a young fellow you're talking about me he jumped up and come running towards me and god's tried to hold him in i said don't let him go i said let him go let him go they they was they was fearful but because the word penetrated him i said only what you're going to get rejoice results is you got to i know i was getting somewhere because it got it it reached home and he was angry i mean he was coming wide open you know and i was ready so what you're going to do brother simon i don't know but i wanted him to come on praise god because i believe that god is the god praise god and i wanted to face him bro head up straight up but they wouldn't let him so the place was shook up i said they can't stand this kind of preaching and that's what the devil you got to shake the devil up you know when jesus came the the lunatic so jesus we know who you why you come to torment us why you come to torment us why you come to mess with us people are possessed with devils and don't and the devil don't want you to mess with them and the people say why are you messing with me that's the demon in them talking about you messing with them why are you messing with us are you a man the devil don't you want us he want to have our lives and our hearts and our minds the devil would have you and he don't want to be exposed he don't want to come out he want to stay there and and make you think that you're going to be all right the devil would like to he he claims he said this is my house brother and sister you either let god rule or let the devil rule if god is not ruling in your life then the devil has got control of you you can't you don't be halfway in halfway out you got to realize that somebody you're going you can't serve too two masters you're gonna love one and hate the other are you a man you can't serve god and mama this ain't no play play game it's for real and the devil is upset with you when you want to do the will of god if you want to walk right you want to live right you want to do what god says in his word then christ is revealing his own word and christ is revealing himself just like he did and david and moses and elijah and all the prophets amen god is revealing himself in his own word praise god now if the word abide in you and you abide in the word then god will manifest himself to be the living word of the hour living and amen manifesting himself in your life he'll be a refuge for you in this troubled time amen the word amen that was written he meant in the bible becomes the living word action it lifts it up out of history it lifts off the pages of the bible and it resides what's inside of human beings are you a man where we're walking
