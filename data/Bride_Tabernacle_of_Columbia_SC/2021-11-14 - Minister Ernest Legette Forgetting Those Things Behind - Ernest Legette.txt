wonderful works and show yourself alive and well by many infallible proofs thank you god for your grace today bless your children all over the land keep us watch over us father for we love you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god is good amen we want to look at the book of philippians by god's grace philippians 3. very familiar scripture [Music] philippians 3 and we'll begin at the beginning first first you got to say amen and it reads finally brother and rejoice in the lord rejoice in the lord to write the same things to you to me and to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the con concision concision for we are the circumcision which worship god in spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though i might also have confidence in the flesh if there if any other man thinketh that he have whereof he might trust in the flesh more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those i counted lost yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i may obtain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i have already attained either were already perfect but i follow out the follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i have apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth until the things which are before are pressed toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many be perfect be thus minded and if any and if anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you may god bless you to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning by the grace of god i just want to minister to you for a moment and i entitled it for getting those things amen forgetting those things i like you know how you know paul says you know in here and he was saying that you know brother and i counting out myself to apprehend it that to have apprehended but this one thing i do come on he's saying you know as he we can look at paul maybe in all of his achievements and things and maybe he looked at himself as his achievements and where he was in god and even some might have looked at him and say how the almighty man of god he was but he just letting the people know hey even though you might look at me as being a certain place i just want to let you know that i ain't there yet amen that i ain't apprehended yet he says but i'm still pressing myself he says toward that mark so and i says that you know even i was telling brother gerald this morning like my grandmother she was saying used to say sometimes that i wish the lord would just go ahead and take me on and i said to her many times i says well the lord ain't gonna take you until you're done with you yet come on i said long as you're still here that means that you still got a work to do and god is still working on you amen so we look at it that way that you know god's got us here for a purpose the reason why we're still here today and many have gone on is because god has still got something that he wants us to do and this even as paul was encouraging them there that you know that come on he says let us all be thus minded we got a race that we gotta run you believe that this morning we gotta race that we gotta run he says that he said i ain't apprehend he says but i'm pressing towards the mark of the high calling but this morning by the god's grace uh my my topic that i want to uh uh make emphasis on is even in doing your pressing towards the mark he says he says that you got to forget those things that are behind come on it's hard to move forward when you're looking behind it's hard to make any ground in progress when you're always looking back you believe that a man that's trying to move forward if he's looking back he might walk into a ditch or he might wreck into a car in front of him why because he's constantly looking back but paul says looking here though is many things that you might can reach back to i want you to forget about those things come on and and i know that that's hard sometimes as an individual and we want to deal with some of that even today i said you know sometimes it's hard to deal to not to forget certain things come on certain uh memories to deal with the memories some certain things in your life are certain there may have been certain turning points or certain places where you were in your life sometimes you know it's hard to forget those things and sometimes even that certain things that you won't forget come on but as i was sharing i was and i just kind of get over myself i was said lately you know that i've been kind of in the encouraging mode trying to encourage you know individuals that hey we got a race to run because what happens with the memory sometimes that the enemy he'll keep us captive to our memory he'll keep us captive to our past to where we can't go no further why because we're held in captivity but i says that god don't desire for us to be held in captivity sometimes we wonder why god does certain things i was sharing with my cousins last week and trying to encourage them after the funeral i says you know sometimes i says i don't ask god why anymore i know brother brother gerald was was preaching to me my sermon this morning well i said i don't i don't ask god why anymore come on i said because god's got a plan and everything come on and no matter how we look at the situation or how the situation looks we got to remember one thing that god's got it all in control and that all things going to work together for the good of them that love god god bringing stuff out of you but like i said being in an encouraging mode i was sharing with those i said there's certain things turning points in your life certain things that happen in your life that yes they they become a part of you so you can't forget them come on but i began to tell my cousin i says that you wonder why sometimes look like god will take the strongest link even in a family come on god or move them out of the way or sometimes in a church god move the strongest link out of the way and sometimes you wonder why god does that but god's got a purpose and everything come on because sometimes he wants you to rise up hallelujah he i believe it was isaiah said the year i mean he said the year that king gozai died he said what i saw the lord god moved to crutch what it was become a crutch from god moved it out away so then he can rise up hallelujah not saying that you say i'm a dethroned person and take their place no but god wants you to learn how to lean and depend on him do you believe that this morning so we find that i said so sometimes you know as things happen but nevertheless and i said god uh uh sometimes we go back down those memory lanes those uh memory lanes sometimes we go back down those those places and i said and i'm gonna say it like this is sometimes there's nothing wrong with look with going down that place because you human sometimes and that that becomes a part of you but don't let it drag you down come on don't let it bring you into captivity sometimes you got to mourn about it a little bit and then you got to pick up and go home come on in the middle of the battle you can't afford to stop and just give up and just start crying on the battlefield come on why because you in the you're in the heat of the battle it's a fight you got to remember the total objective is we got to win this race we got to fight this battle come on we still we still got demons and devils we got to fight we still got to pick gird up our lawns and go on after the enemy how we gonna do that when all the times we we allowing the devil to bring us back into captivity come on no that's why paul says forgetting those things which are behind i do what i press towards that mark how many want to press this morning so we find that i says that what it is a lot of times you know that's what the devil uses there's a lot of times of memory we know that uh uh i says how many times you know that when when god i say it like this coming out ain't it ain't the hardest thing going in is it's easy sometimes for god to bring a person out but not only did he bring you out he didn't bring you out just to stand there and lose come on delusion i say it all the time god didn't never save you to lose you come on but he that we just started to work he's able to finish the work and that's why we come to those places in our lives and understand that hey when you might have a lot of trials and tribulations may come your way lord i didn't start this journey on my own but god it was you that called me and the same one that called me i said lord i'm looking for you to finish it come on and the devil might come to you and like we're saying the other night look at your insufficiency look at what you ain't capable of but remember i wasn't never capable from the beginning i was lost from the beginning i was without hope from the beginning but the god that i served hallelujah he picked me up then and not only did he do that but he put me on my feet and i'm dependent on him hallelujah they're carrying me on the rest of the way i said are you depending on god this morning and that's what you know i say is that a lot of times you can look you can uh uh paul like he says forgetting those things he began to hear in the scriptures encourage the people he says what i want you to do when we look back at our past sometimes we look back at things that we can brag on so paul begin to let you know that if anybody can brag imma be the one that brag come on he says that how he was taught at the graffiti gamalia he says that i was a hebrew of the hebrew concerning zeal i i i i persecuted the church of god i got things that if we gonna brag i can brag for a while he says but all those things don't mean nothing come on he said all those things i had to count what loss i had to forget those things that were behind and when i came to god it's not that god what i could do for you but lord here i am lord clean me up oh jesus how many want god to clean him up this morning i said that's what it is he says that he don't want us here in the scriptures he don't want he says i don't want you to have confidence in the flesh come on confidence in your flesh and what you can do and that's why i believe that come on the grace of god is leading us to to do what let go of what your flesh and what you can do helpless in a case because if it ain't for god what will we be this morning but you know i say as he says here and you know i said how many times that god you know work to work in someone's life save them by a great deliverance and we can go through the scriptures save them by great deliverance only for them to not go into the land i said coming out is easy but going in is another come on because why when you come out yes it's god working miracles signs and wonders but you didn't see the the battles that were up ahead you didn't see the cold nights you didn't see the cold winters and the in the storms that were upper head but nevertheless to keep your eyes on the mark come on keep pressing towards the high calling that lord hallelujah it was you that brought me out i'm looking for you to take me in and that's what uh uh made the difference you know we look at i said many many things how uh we look at how god work delivers him many lives only for them to stumble along the way you know i says that many are called but what few are chosen you believe that this morning come on i come i come to encourage you it says you know god you know paul many times he always referred back to israel and how you know he's like i don't want you to be like them and how god will save them with a great deliverance to only do what destroy them because of their unbelief only for them to to to fall by the wayside all because they couldn't believe in god all because they they even though they came out naturally in their in their flesh in the body they came out but yet their hearts never came out yet the spirits were still in bondage to what memories of what took place in egypt how many believed that this morning why how did you know because every time that something went on every time in the journey when it looked like that god wouldn't give them uh what they wanted when they wanted hallelujah when it looks like that that god may have stepped aside which god never steps aside because he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you but when it looked it like that they always went back in their memory didn't they and began to say that hey were there no graves in egypt oh we can say some things sometimes when it looks like that god ain't doing like like they say what he said he'll do sometimes the devil through the memory will let us look back through those things and say i was better off hallelujah yesterday come on but nevertheless you know i said god know what he doing you know i was i was rebuking someone one time and they was getting talking about like i said how paul says forgetting those things that are behind i was talking to someone once and they was talking about how how they used to have such a good time in the nightclub and how they used to have such a good time and how they got together and we used to have a good time is what they say come on and i says what it is you saying that that reminds me of egypt and how they say i mean israel how they said oh when we were in egypt how we had bread and how we had meat and how we had those things come on you want to talk about the good old days hallelujah when you were bound in sin the good old days when you were bound to alcohol drugs and the things that had you bound sometimes we look back at those things in memory and call them the good old days hallelujah but how you think how you think when god when that reaches up to heaven how does god hear those things come on god is thinking about those times when you were in bondage but i said no the good days started hallelujah when god showed up the good thing they started when god began pulling on my heart when i didn't know what was calling me something was calling me out that's when the good old days started the good old days started when i could lift up my hands and walk into the house of god and freely worship him that's when the good old days started the good old days started when i could look to the cross and see a savior hallelujah i can realize that he done it for me that's when the good days started good day started when i realized that hallelujah that he died for not only the sins of everybody else but it was for me too that's when the good old days started good old days started when i could let down my burdens when i got up out the altar and the weights was lifted off of my shoulder that's when the good old days started hallelujah oh jesus come on but sometimes how i say how you think god feels looking out down on the people that he delivered by great deliverance come on but when times get a little tough come on then they say hey were there no grazing egypt come on why did god bring us out here to die he should have left us come on we might not say that from our natural mouths but in our spirits sometimes come on that's how we conduct ourselves do you believe that this morning come on finding ourselves in those type of conditions but i said god help us but what it is we got to forget those things that behind we got to forget about all of that and look forward hallelujah i said do you want to look forward this morning but we find that i say it's what it is you know god what he wants to do with you today just as you know god forgets your past do you believe that god wants you to let it go as well come on when you come to god and you know you accept what he's done for you at calvary except the blood that's been shed and he wipes away come on put you on a new page he says your sin and iniquities i would do what remember no more come on i want you to press forward i want you to go on hallelujah go on but sometimes that's hard for us to do isn't it sometimes that's hard for us to move past that place but we find that you know that's that's where god is calling us to do you believe that this morning i said as long as you know israel as long as even when they come out like it says forgetting those things that was behind as long as they couldn't forget those things that were behind what were they doing they were only spinning wheels come on they couldn't go forward long as they still had the things that have passed in their memory in their hearts they couldn't go forward they even know they went out and yes god was still with them leading them but they couldn't go into the land why because they couldn't be purged god couldn't purge them of those of their memories god couldn't purge them of the things that have passed so they can only do what spin wheels and many times that's what we find and i said come on you come past this mountain long enough lord i don't want to spin wheels no more come on but god i want to move forward come on he says leaving the the the principle and all these things he said let's do what let's move on let's go on in guard god's got places that he want to take you to he don't want to you don't want to deal with your dish here and deal with your next year on the same things or maybe you not even move forward but you move back a little bit but come on as the time go on and the years go on god wants you to move on and go on and go on inning guard do you believe that this morning hallelujah and that's what we find ourselves all the time even in those places come on we said lord yesterday is gone tomorrow may never be mine but lord i want to forget about those things and press towards that mark of the high calling i said do you want a press this morning but as long as you know as long as you know they can keep those things in their mind you know have the the fantasies or the things in their memories to keep those things in their minds come on it would always do what keep them and held them keep them held captive you know i thought about paul and how paul even he can go back even in his mind he had some low spots in his mind didn't he he had some low spots in his past so where he even persecuted the church of god i believe it was stephen and holly stoned and all these things but he understood that when that it was all in working it was all in the plan of god you say how could those things be in the plan of god we don't know sometimes how things work out but it was all in god's plan but somewhere in his paul's spirit somewhere in paul's walk he had to learn how to forget about those things he had to start over all over again and say hey let me start the day hallelujah and work and give god all i got but he had to find a way to do that but i said as long as we can fantasize on those things what it does it's top side it stops our events long as we got those things in our mind it stops our events come on long as we don't learn to forget those things i thought about lot's wife and how how hard like i said is forgetting those things that are behind come on she couldn't forget those things that were behind and what happened to her come on god brought him out didn't god bring him out but it wasn't long even after giving up because what he told them he even told him when he was bringing them out the bible says that while they yet lingered god being merciful to them come on grab them by the hands i say oh god is being merciful to us even today we see the signs of the time we know that god could come at any time and take his bride and catch his own home but yet what are we doing sometime in our spirit we're lingering come on lingering with the things of the world playing with the devil all the times but yet what is god doing even here this morning god is being merciful hallelujah god is grabbing us by the hand calling us to prayer calling us the consecration telling you i want you to let go hallelujah oh jesus do you believe that this morning come on god is soon to come we can preach that year in and year out but what happens in our spirit lingering come on but what it is god is calling us but the bible says god being merciful to them what were they lingering for hallelujah seeing that the city was going to be destroyed but nevertheless i believe that they can look around at sodom and gomorrah and the devil could have their minds blinded to the to the doom that was getting ready to hit the city have their minds blinded to the chaos that was getting ready to come because all of that looked more appealing hallelujah than the call of god what does the devil did to do today same thing make the world look more appealing hallelujah give you more money give you better cause give you better houses make everything look appealing to blind your eyes to the doom that's on the city come on but nevertheless god is still calling somebody'll hear that call somebody will say i want to let go of the world somebody will say i don't want money and i don't want fame but in the morning when i rise hallelujah give me jesus hallelujah i said in the morning come on let go but what it is they couldn't forget those things hard forgetting those things he came out one thing that the angels began to tell them hallelujah god brought you out but don't look back hallelujah forget those things that are behind you go on hallelujah enjoy the blessings and the grace of god but though they went out i could see that in her heart hallelujah she's still looking back wasn't she and what happened we know the story come on i said forgetting those things that are behind god calling us out to do what he says i want you to press paul said forgetting those things that are behind i want you to press come on press towards that mark are you pressing this morning come on forget forget what's behind you press sometimes like we said certain things that's embedded inside of you yes but nevertheless don't let it take you don't let it hold your cap hallelujah what you got to do sometimes you got to deal with it you gotta sometimes you gotta ask the lord to help you deal with it god help me hallelujah help me in my spirit god make me strong lord help me god and move on because if i stay here i'm gonna die lord if i stay here god i'll miss miss you're coming come on i said do you want to miss god coming this morning come on nobody don't want to miss god coming do you but what it is you want to press what all you got i said as long as they as they did those things come on fantasizing what happened that they couldn't move forward and it came to a place to where you know they never they never really were free they never really came out of bondage but what god did there in the end come on he had to deal with them and tell him all right he says since you don't know how to since you couldn't let the things of the past go he says that you know y'all won't y'all won't enter in he says but the young ones come on somebody that i can deal with hallelujah somebody that that maybe they didn't they were little children so maybe their memories in those areas didn't affect him he says but i'ma take of them and carry them into the land come on i say everybody quiet this morning forgetting those things come on but to take take those one and and bring them in what is god doing for us this morning come on i said where where are we sometimes we look at our lives and we look at year like i say it's 20 21 and i said god where are we come on what would the devil love to do woo our minds and say hey we just going on we just going on come on but this ain't where god intended for you to be come on god still intended for you to progress god is still intending for us to move and be changed from glory to glory sometimes we can't hear because of all the noise of the world because all of the noise and everything else around us but god is still beckoning his people god is still calling the voice of god is still going out but he says that he that hath the ear let him hear come on how are you going to have an ear because the holy ghost has to give you the ears come on you can't hear without the holy ghost you can't hear what the spirit is saying but he said that he that hath an ear i says god open our ears let us hear you calling god because if we can't hear you calling we'll miss you come on if we can't hear what you're saying we'll miss you i don't know about you but i says we don't want to run this race to miss him at the end what good would be all of the testimonies and how god brought you out and all the testimonies and all the shouting and the dancing on the reds on the other side of the red sea do if you don't make it over until the on the land to the into the land i said coming out is the easy thing but going in hallelujah oh jesus come on when they was going into the land what did god tell joshua he says that you're going to have to fight come on he says the land i'll give to you every place that the sole of your foot touched he said i'll give it to you hallelujah but you're gonna have to fight for it you're gonna have to press don't you worry about the giants that's in the land i've already displaced them for your sake but i still want you to fight hallelujah i still want you to press i don't know about you but i says when god calls a man he tells lets that man know that come on i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you even in you don't worry about the journey ahead i'm gonna fight all your battles hallelujah the night the night the nights might get dark sometimes the way it might get hard like paul says i had to suffer some things come on didn't paul say that he said i had to i had to suffer some things come on but nevertheless we counted all what joy because we know that weeping are doing for a night but joy is coming in the morning after you suffered a while come on god is going to strengthen you establish you and settle you hallelujah do you believe that this morning i said come on don't do do through my suffering through my pain and all those things i'm not worried about it why because i'm laying in the bosom of al-shadiyah hallelujah oh jesus come on i said god sometimes sometimes you got to pray and ask god to help you come on sometimes you got to pray i say you got to pray and ask god to help you help you to overcome these things paul said forgetting those things which are behind sometimes you got to pray and ask god to help you sometimes you got to pray and ask god to give you strength sometimes you got to go tell them and say i'll shout y'all come on i want to lay in your bosom just a little while sometimes you got to go and say come on god be the jehovah the old hallelujah jesus are the new god i need you sometimes you got to pray and ask god for leadership god i need you to leave me sometimes you got to pray and ask god for peace god i need your peace sometimes you got to pray and ask god for things hallelujah oh jesus come on he said you have not because you asked not you know god liking us unto sheep why because they're such a helpless in the defense living defenseless animal come on they can't they have no defense against themselves but they look for the shepherd to be their defense come on and that's how god is is liking us to today what it is somebody says i'm a strong man i got strength and i got guns and i got all these things that don't mean nothing come on what it is we ain't fighting against flesh and blood but it's principalities and powers spiritual wickedness and high places but the weapons of our warfare are not carnal they're mighty through god hallelujah in the pulling down of strongholds yes there's powers that we're fighting but i know hallelujah the master of the wind i know hallelujah to make or the rain hallelujah the rain might be falling but i know to make all the rain hallelujah oh jesus come on i said forgetting those things you know i like that how paul was talking about it he says that i might know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings come on we know that that says what it is this morning we got to forget those things which are behind like i said it is hard i said it's hard but some things you know i was the lord was dealing with me on some things like i said even with memory i said what it is you know we don't have time now to uh to be to to uh be stunned in our growth come on we don't have that time i was sharing with brother gerald and i'll say it like this i says that you know even when my when my grandfather passed away i said it took me over a year to get over it i says it took me a while to deal with it because why i had all these things that would always come up come on in your memory all these things and which i said you can't get rid of certain things it says but it took me a long time not saying you got over it but to learn how to deal with it but what it is in the end you found out what it was it was the enemy come on working with certain places in your spirit to do what keep you from progressing keep you from growing keeping you from doing what going on in god as we said today that sometimes i mean the other night we look at those that have gone on and we say hey when lord knows we're going to see him again one day but in order for us to see him again one day we got to finish the race that we're running come on we still got a race to run we still got demons to fight we still got strongholds to pull down so what do we have to do we got to say lord help me give me strip to run this race god i want to make it on the other side lord help me help me to move over from here hallelujah somebody said how you say for you forget though come on but what paul was talking about here this morning that don't let those things behind keep you from moving forward don't let those things behind hallelujah stop you from going into the land don't let those things from behind become a hindrance in your christian journey but nevertheless press forward hallelujah i said do you want to press forward this morning come on i'll be short this morning i say god is so good amen forgetting those things come on how crafty the devil is come on and how he'll hold you captive come on i said don't let the devil hold you captive this morning come on god has delivered you why should you be bound come on god has set you free why should you be captive come on but what it is israel was free natural but they were bound in their spirits wasn't it never could overcome never could forget those things which were behind so it did what stopped them from pressing forward i said today come on we got things that's in our spirit if you believe that things that's in your in your spirit and all that that'll do what hold your captive come on freeze you in time as i was sharing with some people i said the thing is don't be frozen in time come on but as god moves move with god as god picks up and going come on the journey ain't complete we want to move with god we want to go wherever say lord leave me lord i'll follow come on we want to move along with the spirit of god hallelujah you do you want to do that this morning let us bow jesus i said forgetting those things that are behind come on he said i press towards the mark all god's children has got a race to run how many want to run that race this morning come on how many want to say lord help me like i said sometimes you
