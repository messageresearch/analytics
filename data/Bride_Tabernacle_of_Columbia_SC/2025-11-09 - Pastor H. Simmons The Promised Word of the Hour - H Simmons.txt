Amen. &gt;&gt; Go. &gt;&gt; And [snorts] when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son. And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in the words and in deeds. And when he was fully 40 years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel. And seeing [snorts] one of them suffer wrong, he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smoked the Egyptians. And for he supposed his brethren would have [snorts] understood how that God by his hand would deliver them. But they understood not. And [snorts] the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sir, ye are brethren, [snorts] why do ye wrong one to another? But he that he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? Wilt thou killed me as thou didest the Egyptian yesterday? [snorts] Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Mian, where he begott sons. And when 40 years was expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Si, an angel of the Lord in a flame of a fire in a bush. When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. And as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dust not behold. Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place where thou standeth is holy ground. I have seen I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them and now come I will send thee into Egypt. This Moses whom thou refused saying [snorts] who made thee a ro a ruler and a judge the same day God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel. &gt;&gt; You know often times you they'll ask who do you think you are?

I got my cuz they got more lawyers than me. And I can get, I'mma do this, I'mma do that. A man when he stutting me. But I something dropped in my spirit.

You're not going to move the devil by Amen. by your own human effort, but by love and compassion. By humility, the devil has to move. You see what I'm saying? And you begin to speak with humility. This person that was in power says, "Sir, can you help me? I I [clears throat] understand the situation, but can you help me? Can you do anything to help me? He said, "Sure, I'll be glad to help you." Everything changed. There was no argument. There was no debate. There was a change of atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

It works with love. Are you with me? So a lot of times your faith is not working because it don't have the love of God with it. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I want God to move." Then you must realize that it takes a life beh. &gt;&gt; And then you see God begin to move. When you get out the waiting, God can move. So God sent Moses down when the time of promise drew near. God sent him down in such an hour and he knew the hour that he was living in. It was the season for deliverance. How many of you believe that this is season for deliverance? &gt;&gt; It's time of the end drawing nigh. &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
