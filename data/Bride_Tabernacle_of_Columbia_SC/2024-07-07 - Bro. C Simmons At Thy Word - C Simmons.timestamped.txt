[36:50] verse
[36:50] 4 when you got it say amen amen and it
[36:54] reads now when he had left speaking he
[36:57] said to Simon launch out into the deep
[37:00] and let down your nets for a dropped and
[37:03] Simon
[37:04] answering answered and said unto him
[37:06] Master we have toiled all night and have
[37:10] taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I
[37:13] will let down the
[37:15] net and and when they had this done they
[37:20] inclosed they enclosed a great multitude
[37:23] of fishes and the Nets break and they
[37:26] beckoned unto the partner ERS which were
[37:28] in the other ship and that they should
[37:31] come and help them and they came and
[37:33] filled both the ships so that they began
[37:36] to sing when Simon Peter saw it he fell
[37:39] down at jesus' knee saying depart from
[37:42] me for I am a sinful man oh Lord for he
[37:46] was astonished and all that were with
[37:49] him at the drought of the fishes which

[37:55] drought of the fishes which they had
[37:57] taken
[37:58] amen God bless the reading of this of

[38:01] seated amen this morning I'd like to
[38:04] take a simple text that I I entitled at
[38:07] Thy word amen at Thy word and it comes
[38:10] from if you look back in the scripture
[38:12] then you can see it here in
[38:15] verse verse 5 he said nevertheless at
[38:18] Thy word I will let down the net see
[38:21] Jesus he had come to his disciples and
[38:23] after a long day and and they went out
[38:25] on the deep and they went fishing and
[38:28] Jesus and they had toiled all night to
[38:31] catch these fish now you got to think
[38:33] about it these fishermen they had fished
[38:35] all their lives they had done this and
[38:37] they knew how to do it but that night
[38:39] they came up empty but they but Jesus
[38:42] came to them and he said go back out and
[38:45] launch out into the deep and let down
[38:47] your nets and and and someone might have
[38:51] said well we done done this all night we
[38:52] done done this over and over again why
[38:55] we got to do it again but s and he had
[38:57] this little small thing called faith
[39:00] that he just believed that you know what
[39:02] I'm going to do it once more I'm going
[39:04] to try this once more even though I toed
[39:06] all night I'm going to go and I'm going
[39:07] to drop it down and he said at Thy word
[39:10] nevertheless at Thy word he might he
[39:13] came back and he said Lord forgive me
[39:15] depart from me for I am sinful cuz Simon
[39:18] might have doubt it but even in his
[39:20] little doubt he said you know what I'm
[39:22] still going to believe just enough to
[39:24] see if it's true I ain't got no harm in
[39:26] believing that God is still real I have
[39:29] no harm in believing that he's still God
[39:31] and that all I have to do is let it down
[39:33] if it don't happen then hey I have lost
[39:36] nothing but he came to him and he said
[39:38] nevertheless at at Thy word I let down
[39:42] the net and he let it down and he saw
[39:44] the great blessings that followed when
[39:46] he let down the net he realized they had
[39:48] enough of them and they both it was so
[39:51] much that it broke their Nets and they
[39:52] called their friends and it filled up
[39:54] their boat too see when God go to
[39:56] blessing he don't just bless you he
[39:59] blessed those that are around you
[40:00] sometimes all you have to believe is at
[40:02] Thy word and take them at his word and
[40:05] God can do the miraculous God can do the
[40:07] wonderful because he's God so all you
[40:10] have to do is believe at his word
[40:12] sometimes we come to this place and I
[40:14] was looking at it and there's so many
[40:16] there's gateways to to a man and and the
[40:20] first is in the body and you
[40:22] have you have the five senses you have
[40:25] sight you have smell you have hear
[40:27] hearing you have taste and touch and
[40:29] when you go down to the next level you
[40:31] get into the spirit where there's
[40:33] imagination constant conscience memory
[40:36] reason and affections but deep down in
[40:39] the inside there's something called the
[40:41] soul and in your soul you only have two
[40:44] things there's faith and there's doubt
[40:46] amen and sometimes you have to choose
[40:48] which one you going to you going to side
[40:50] on but when you come to it the one that
[40:53] you should side on is Faith cuz with
[40:56] that all things are POS possible all you
[40:58] have to do is believe just have faith in
[41:00] What God Says and nothing can stand
[41:03] against you he said no weapon formed
[41:05] against me shall prosper and all you
[41:07] have to do is take God's word and you
[41:09] can defeat every devil and every demon
[41:11] that may come against you that's what
[41:14] Jesus did when he took him up on the
[41:15] mountain he he took him up there he said
[41:18] all this I give you and and and the
[41:21] Jesus said thou shall not tempt the Lord
[41:24] thy God he wasn't using nothing new it
[41:26] was already written
[41:27] it was already there he didn't have to
[41:29] go find it cuz he knew it it was already
[41:32] in him that's why the Bible says train
[41:34] up a child in the way he should go and
[41:36] when he is old he shall not depart from
[41:38] it he said Thy word have I hid in my
[41:40] heart that I might not sin against thee
[41:42] see something things got to be in you so
[41:44] when the Devil Comes you wanton you'll
[41:46] be able to defeat them you may have
[41:48] strayed away a little here there but you
[41:50] still remember the small things of when
[41:52] you learn when you were in your child
[41:54] and when you're Youth and sometimes it
[41:55] don't happen in everyone's youth
[41:57] it happens when you get older but when
[41:59] you learn it you realize that God is
[42:01] real you realize that all I have to do
[42:03] is stand on God's word and he'll take
[42:05] care of the rest all I have to do is
[42:08] believe that he is God and he'll take
[42:10] care of the rest all that I may think I
[42:12] want to do and may want to achieve God
[42:15] is able to do it for me all I have to do
[42:17] is
[42:18] believe and I was reading something and
[42:21] I I was reading and I thought about the
[42:24] story in Matthew chapter 14 if we can
[42:26] turn there
[42:27] Matthew chapter 14 and there's another
[42:30] story about Jesus on the Jesus dealing
[42:33] with the boat and his disciples and in
[42:36] verse
[42:38] 14 chapter 14 and verse
[42:45] 22 and it reads and straight away Jesus
[42:48] constrained his disciples to get into a
[42:50] ship and to go before him unto the other
[42:54] side and while he sent the multitudes
[42:56] away and when he had sent the multitudes
[42:58] away he went up into a mountain apart to
[43:01] pray and when the evening was come he
[43:04] was there alone but the ship was now in
[43:06] the midst of the sea tossed with waves
[43:09] from the wind for the winds was contrary
[43:12] see sometimes you get in life and it's
[43:14] like a ship on a stormy sea and the
[43:17] winds are blowing and the waves are
[43:19] tossing and you're going back and forth
[43:22] and and when you read on it said in the
[43:24] Fourth Watch of the night see sometimes
[43:26] the ship toss all night long it toss all
[43:29] night long and in the Fourth Watch of
[43:32] the night Jesus went unto them walking
[43:34] on the sea and when the disciples saw
[43:37] him walking on the sea they was troubled
[43:40] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[43:42] for for fear but straight away Jesus
[43:45] spake unto them and saying be of good
[43:47] cheer it is I be not afraid they said
[43:50] when God shows up he always says Be not
[43:53] Afraid cuz you don't have to be no
[43:55] afraid afraid no more cuz the one that
[43:57] can calm the sea is there in the midst
[44:00] and Peter answered him and said Lord if
[44:02] it be thou bid me bid me to come unto
[44:06] thee on the water and he said come see
[44:10] at at his word Peter decided that he he
[44:13] got enough faith and he went and said
[44:15] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[44:17] he walked on the water to go to Jesus
[44:20] Peter Faith increased by the word of God
[44:23] his faith increased when he heard Come
[44:25] Peter got his faith increased and he
[44:27] stepped down on the water but here's
[44:29] what happened see in verse 30 he said
[44:32] but when he saw the winds boisterous and
[44:35] he was afraid and be and beginning to
[44:37] sink he cried saying Lord save me see
[44:41] once Peter stopped looking at Jesus and
[44:43] he looked at the storm he began to doubt
[44:46] he began to doubt on his salvation he
[44:48] began to doubt on what was taking place
[44:51] he lost faith that Jesus had told him to
[44:53] come and that Jesus had provided a way
[44:56] for him to make to him he had provided a
[44:58] way that he' be able to walk on the
[45:00] water all the way to Jesus because Jesus
[45:02] told him to come because he started
[45:04] looking at the storm and he might have
[45:06] remembered how he was in the ship
[45:08] tossing and turning and they didn't know
[45:10] if they was going to make
[45:11] it but he but Jesus had told him to come
[45:15] and and he cried and saying Lord save me
[45:18] and verse 31 it says and immediately
[45:20] Jesus stretched forth his hands and C
[45:22] him and said oh thou of little faith
[45:25] wherefore didst th doubt I wonder this
[45:29] morning sometimes when you come to God
[45:31] and you're asking for something does is
[45:33] this what God asks you sometime oh thou
[45:36] of little faith wherefore didst thou
[45:39] doubt say there's nothing that God can't
[45:41] do there's nothing that is impossible
[45:44] and he gives us testimonies over
[45:46] testimony to show us that he's still God
[45:49] and when they were coming to the ship in
[45:51] verse 32 the wind ceased and then they
[45:55] that were in the ship come and worshiped
[45:56] him I'm saying of Truth thou are the Son
[45:59] of God said there was many in in the
[46:02] scripture said that some people have to
[46:04] see to believe but it's more blessed to
[46:07] believe without
[46:08] seeing something that that you can just
[46:11] take a word and go forth and believe
[46:13] that God is able to do it it's something
[46:15] that come to him and just read something
[46:18] and it catch a hole deep down on the
[46:19] inside and it moves you to a point that
[46:22] you say I have no doubt I can move on
[46:25] and I can step forward because CU I can
[46:27] I believe that what he said is true I
[46:30] believe that what he said is possible
[46:32] and I believe that God is still God and
[46:34] he can do it he said that that he he'll
[46:37] never leave you nor forsake you and
[46:39] he'll be to there always and I was
[46:42] reading something and I started to think
[46:45] about how powerful the word of God is
[46:48] amen I started to think about and I was
[46:50] reading something and they were starting
[46:52] to describe said you know the same faith
[46:54] that Peter had where he said neveress at
[46:57] Thy word and he let down the nests
[46:59] that's the same power in those words
[47:02] that created the world and he started
[47:04] taking it from Genesis and said that's
[47:06] the same one that said let there be
[47:08] light and there was light that's the
[47:11] same words that said let the let the
[47:14] waters be separated from the land that's
[47:16] the same one that created the animals
[47:18] that's the same one that created the
[47:20] trees that's the same words that was
[47:22] able to create where we live today
[47:25] that's the same one that created Nations
[47:27] and caused them to rise up and caused
[47:30] them to be torn down that's the same one
[47:32] that causes Empires to rise up and be
[47:34] taken down that's the same one that
[47:36] comes by you each and every day that
[47:38] wakes you up in the morning that's the
[47:40] same one that allows you to go to sleep
[47:42] at night it's the same words that he
[47:45] just speaks the word and things happen
[47:47] you see it's at his word that thing that
[47:50] the moon hangs in the sky that the sun
[47:52] shines every day that the clouds come
[47:55] and cover the Earth it's the word words
[47:57] of God that allow these things to happen
[47:59] all you have to do is believe
[48:02] amen said I was reading something said
[48:05] if you have got a little faith let him
[48:08] have it a while he'll make it great said
[48:11] if you got a little faith let him have
[48:13] it a while he'll make it great that's
[48:16] right the likes of the fishes in the
[48:18] boy's hand it was just it could only
[48:21] feed him but in jesus' hand it fed 5,000
[48:25] said it was just a little bit of Faith
[48:27] him just Allowing God he said Lord you
[48:29] can have what I have I just have a
[48:31] little bit I got five fishes and two
[48:34] loaves of bread said said he gave that
[48:37] to Jesus and it fed 5,000 just with a
[48:40] little bit of Faith see it may be a
[48:42] little thing with you but just give it
[48:44] over to him and watch him bless it and
[48:47] bless others with it and what and what
[48:50] little faith you have tonight give it
[48:52] over to him and he'll bless it and he'll
[48:54] use it for his glory say how how many
[48:57] want God to use your faith for his glory
[48:59] how many want God to use you for his
[49:02] glory and I was reading it all it takes
[49:04] is a little and I was reading in the
[49:06] text of how and I was going back over
[49:08] Theo this the story in the Bible where
[49:11] he talks all you have to do is have the
[49:12] faith of a mustard seed said it don't
[49:15] take much Faith to move to have God on
[49:17] the scene it don't take much faith for
[49:20] God to come down and move in such a
[49:22] mighty way all it takes is a little
[49:25] faith but all you have to take God at
[49:28] his word and he can do the impossible
[49:31] said Jesus healed a boy One Time by he
[49:34] spoke a word to his father and the next
[49:36] day the boy's fever left him that day
[49:39] and he began to amend see think about
[49:41] the word of God that God didn't even
[49:43] speak the word to the boy he spoke it to
[49:45] his father and things happen sometimes
[49:49] it's by your faith that things can
[49:50] happen for others it's by your faith and
[49:53] your prayers that things take place in
[49:55] other people's lives so don't forget
[49:58] when God plac someone on your heart to
[50:00] pray for them you don't know what God is
[50:02] doing in their life and he's using you
[50:04] to be a testimony he's using you to be
[50:07] someone to pull them through and to help
[50:09] them Reach to where God wants to get
[50:11] them to say he spoke to his father and
[50:15] said the Bible called it a miracle this
[50:18] is again the second Miracle Jesus did
[50:21] when he came into Galilee he said first
[50:23] he turned the water to wine now that the
[50:26] water would have been wine someday
[50:28] anyhow perhaps see this was catching to
[50:31] me I was reading I was reading this how
[50:34] he said that God turned the water into
[50:36] wine he said it would have it it would
[50:38] have been wine someday anyhow perhaps
[50:41] but it would have had to go through the
[50:43] regular procedure of going up the grap
[50:46] Vine coming out into the grae and bring
[50:49] brought back so forth like that and
[50:51] Jesus bypassed all that because he was
[50:54] the god of nature amen see God he
[50:57] sometimes your healing may be on the way
[51:00] but God can speed up the process he's
[51:02] the one that's able to create he's the
[51:05] only one that's able to create and said
[51:07] he just bypassed the vine and everything
[51:10] and he made the water right into wine
[51:12] because he had the control of all things
[51:16] didn't he have to be it didn't have to
[51:18] be distilled or however they make wine I
[51:21] don't know but anyhow he just turned it
[51:24] right into wine there and that was what
[51:26] we call a miracle see sometimes what we
[51:29] call a miracle is just God speeding up
[51:31] the process it's just God taking over
[51:34] and coming on the scene and said the
[51:36] next thing he did was to just speak a
[51:38] word and the man trying to get him to
[51:40] come pray for someone he said go thy way
[51:43] thy son liveth so all he has to do is
[51:45] speak a word and and things can
[51:48] happen but all we have to do is take his
[51:51] word when it's spoken and believe it it
[51:54] does you no good to hear the word spoken
[51:56] and not believe nothing that happen but
[51:59] sometimes you got to take that spoken
[52:01] word and believe it deep down in the
[52:03] inside and have faith and not doubt it
[52:06] no matter what no matter who says what
[52:08] and how it said to you all you have to
[52:10] do is have faith and never doubt said in
[52:13] Mark they was on the they was on the
[52:15] other ship and I and I wanted to
[52:17] highlight this one because when they was
[52:20] there it said something that was
[52:21] important when the waves were tossing
[52:24] and turning them they went and woke up
[52:26] Jes Jesus cuz he was on the ship and he
[52:29] was sleeping but when he was there and
[52:32] Jesus he he arose and he stood up and he
[52:35] chastised him and said said and I and I
[52:38] asked the question I said sometimes do
[52:41] we remember who's in the boat with us
[52:43] amen do we remember but when he stood up
[52:46] he said peace be
[52:48] still and sometimes that's what you need
[52:50] the Lord to do in your life you said
[52:52] Lord I need peace Lord I need Joy Lord I
[52:55] need patience Lord I need Temperance
[52:58] Lord I need you I need more love in my
[53:00] life I need more love in my heart for my
[53:02] brother for my sister but Lord sometimes
[53:05] the Lord comes and he allows you to see
[53:07] things to work on you he allows you to
[53:10] go through things to show you that
[53:11] there's more that you have to give and
[53:13] you have to take a more at his word
[53:16] there's more that you have to come to
[53:18] and you have to understand that
[53:20] sometimes those that are around you are
[53:22] just showing you that God is trying to
[53:24] work on you see you can't get your
[53:26] blessing until God has working on you
[53:28] sometimes and God is taking you through
[53:30] some things but all you have to do is
[53:32] come to and said Lord at Thy word I
[53:35] believe that no matter what I may be
[53:37] going through and no matter what I may
[53:39] be seeing that Lord you're still working
[53:41] on me you're still perfecting me and
[53:43] Lord I'm going to take you at your word
[53:45] and I'm not going to doubt I'm not going
[53:47] to doubt that Lord You Are God I'm not
[53:49] going to doubt that you can't change
[53:51] things for the greater and for a
[53:53] blessing to you and he said said that
[53:57] that that's why I liked it cuz he said
[54:00] he spoke the word and things happened
[54:03] amen it was a spoken word that come at
[54:06] that time and he spoke the word and and
[54:08] and the storm dissipated and it went
[54:10] back to calm seas now imagine all those
[54:13] fishermen that have been in many storms
[54:16] you had to know that that storm was bad
[54:19] you had to know this wasn't just a
[54:20] regular storm cuz they had been through
[54:22] storms many times in their lives they
[54:24] have done this all their life
[54:26] so they had to know that this was
[54:28] something that was different and they
[54:30] realized that you know what somebody got
[54:33] and said hold up Jesus is in the boat
[54:36] Jesus is in the ship with me why we need
[54:39] to go wake him up now we've seen
[54:41] Miracles we seen signs we seen these
[54:44] things but why don't we go get Jesus
[54:47] amen and it it I don't know who it was
[54:51] as I tell the story but when they got
[54:53] him on the scene Jesus stood up and he
[54:56] said peace be still amen said it it is
[54:59] it was really striking to me that the
[55:01] story was told many times but that was
[55:03] where they put down the words peace be
[55:05] still that he spoke to the storm it said
[55:08] is is I and I started to see that
[55:11] sometimes you got to go to the Lord and
[55:13] and get him on the scene and said Lord I
[55:15] need you to do a work Lord I need you to
[55:18] do something for me that may not others
[55:20] may not understand but I know that you
[55:23] the god that's real amen and I know that
[55:26] you you're the same God that spoke the
[55:27] heavens and the earth into existence
[55:30] you're the same God that that created
[55:33] life that created Man Out of the Dust of
[55:35] the ground you're the same God that came
[55:38] down and and you showed yourself forth
[55:40] by doing these many wonderful works and
[55:43] then I start to look in Acts and I
[55:45] started to see what would it what
[55:47] happens when people believe God's work
[55:51] what happens and I came to Acts chapter
[55:53] 4 and and Acts chapter 1 actually and I
[55:57] started to see what God told him he said
[56:00] and let's turn there Acts chapter
[56:03] one it's very familiar
[56:11] scripture acts 1 and
[56:15] verse4 and he said being assembled
[56:18] together with them commanded them that
[56:21] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[56:23] but wait for the promise of the Father
[56:25] which sayth he ye have heard of
[56:28] me yay have heard of me for John truly
[56:33] baptized with water but ye shall be
[56:35] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[56:38] days hence say if you go on to the story
[56:41] in the book of Acts chapter 2 you
[56:43] realize that they listen to the word of
[56:45] God they got together and they got up in
[56:47] the upper room in verse 12 and chapter
[56:50] one but in verse in chapter 2 they
[56:53] talked about how that when they got
[56:55] together and on one one Accord by
[56:57] believing the word of God and what he
[56:59] has spoken to them things happened
[57:02] something happened in that upper room
[57:04] that was able to come down and the Holy
[57:06] Ghost came down on them just like
[57:08] clothing tongues of fire that was there
[57:10] in that room and it changed their lives
[57:12] forever it changed not only their lives
[57:14] but when they went out they was such a
[57:16] testimony that that day 3,000 people got
[57:19] saved Not only was it that some people
[57:21] Marvel because there was many different
[57:23] people that was there in that City many
[57:26] different languages nationality but
[57:28] everyone heard it in their own language
[57:30] see they believ the word of God to such
[57:32] a point that they wanted to see
[57:34] something happen they wanted to see that
[57:37] that word of God be manifested in them
[57:39] they wanted to come to the place that
[57:41] they realized that they didn't just want
[57:43] to hear the word of God but they wanted
[57:45] to be an enactment of that word of God
[57:47] out and forth and so they got there in
[57:50] the upper room and God came down in such
[57:54] a mighty and a special way that they was
[57:56] was able to witness and they was a and
[57:58] lives were changed and things happened
[58:00] and they went forth not only there that
[58:02] that testimony kept going because when
[58:05] they went back to their homes they had a
[58:07] testimony of what God could do they had
[58:09] a testimony of how great God was they
[58:13] had a testimony that God had died on the
[58:15] cross and had saved them and shed his
[58:17] blood and that he had went there to
[58:20] Calvary to die for sinners like them and
[58:22] he had allowed them to come back and to
[58:25] be uh uh have a way of propitiation to
[58:28] get back to Heaven see that day of just
[58:32] listening to what God has said and then
[58:34] saying Lord I'm going to take you at
[58:36] your word and just realizing the power
[58:39] and effect that the word of God has they
[58:41] was able to go on and to see God move in
[58:44] such a mighty and a special way amen yes
[58:49] amen said sometimes we have to get to
[58:52] the point that we just trust God Amen
[58:55] that we just said Lord I'm just going to
[58:57] take you at your word and it doesn't
[58:59] matter if this one or that one says yay
[59:01] or nay Lord I'm going to trust you Lord
[59:04] I'm going to take you at your word and
[59:05] I'm going to believe that you'll do just
[59:07] what you said Lord I'm going to believe
[59:10] that you can heal the sick cuz not only
[59:12] do I believe that I've seen you do it
[59:14] Lord I'm going to believe that you can
[59:16] save the Lost not only have I not only
[59:19] do I believe it but I've seen you do it
[59:21] so that just increases my faith that
[59:23] Lord you can continue to do it Lord I
[59:26] seen you answer prayers because I prayed
[59:28] and you've done it for me so Lord I'm
[59:30] going to believe that what I asked for
[59:32] Lord you're going to deliver it to me
[59:34] cuz you cuz I asked it from you and Lord
[59:36] as long as it wasn't contrary to your
[59:38] will you said that your word can't
[59:40] return to your Void said that's the God
[59:43] that he said just at my word all you
[59:45] have to do every blessing that you want
[59:48] is in his word all you have to do is ask
[59:50] and say Lord in your word you said you
[59:54] said and these things can happen for you
[59:56] these things can come to pass because
[59:58] it's at your word lord it's not my words
[1:00:01] lord it's what you said so I have faith
[1:00:04] in your word that you'll do what you
[1:00:06] said you'll do I have faith in your word
[1:00:09] that you can do these things The
[1:00:11] Impossible because you said there's
[1:00:13] nothing impossible if he can create the
[1:00:15] worlds he can do everything else and it
[1:00:18] and it says in Hebrews it says the
[1:00:21] worlds were created by by were framed by
[1:00:24] the word of God said the were framed by
[1:00:26] the word of God and see God has a way of
[1:00:29] doing anything and exceedingly
[1:00:31] abundantly above all that we can ask or
[1:00:33] think cuz I thought about it I said
[1:00:35] sometimes we don't realize how limited
[1:00:38] our mind is amen yes we don't realize
[1:00:41] the limits that our minds come to it's
[1:00:44] only by his it's only that God allows us
[1:00:47] to sometime to see beyond what we can
[1:00:50] see he to see beyond that he takes you
[1:00:53] there he allows you and he does things
[1:00:55] that we can't even see or we don't even
[1:00:58] understand because he's God and he knows
[1:01:00] all things but we can take him at his
[1:01:02] word that all we he didn't say you had
[1:01:04] to do this or that he said just believe
[1:01:07] I thought about the prophet God he
[1:01:09] always Su that song only believe cuz the
[1:01:11] angel told him he said if you can get
[1:01:13] the the people to believe that's all
[1:01:16] that matters if if you can get the
[1:01:18] people to believe then the God would do
[1:01:20] the rest amen God would do the rest it
[1:01:22] wasn't a man but it was God doing the
[1:01:24] work it was God coming down and moving
[1:01:27] in the midst it was God because it was a
[1:01:29] people that that came to a certain point
[1:01:31] and come to certain level of faith that
[1:01:33] Lord I'm going to take you at your word
[1:01:35] that you can do the work Lord I'm going
[1:01:37] to take you at your word that you'll
[1:01:39] just move in my midst Lord I have a need
[1:01:41] and Lord I want you to come down and I
[1:01:43] want you to touch that neede Lord I want
[1:01:45] you to move in such a mighty way cuz
[1:01:48] Lord I'm going to take you at your word
[1:01:50] amen yeah say it wasn't a man or anybody
[1:01:53] else that can do it it's not you that
[1:01:55] can heal but God's the only Healer not
[1:01:58] even the doctor can heal you only God
[1:02:00] can heal you and God and you have to go
[1:02:02] and say Lord by your stripes I am healed
[1:02:05] so sometimes someone might not
[1:02:07] understand cuz you might still be
[1:02:09] limping you might not still as the as
[1:02:11] the story May said you might still your
[1:02:13] eyes might still be blinded but that
[1:02:15] doesn't mean that God hasn't done the
[1:02:17] work that doesn't mean that God isn't
[1:02:19] started the process that doesn't mean
[1:02:21] that it's not going to take place all
[1:02:23] you have to do is not doubt all you have
[1:02:26] to do is continue to believe that God is
[1:02:28] God and I'm going to take you at your
[1:02:30] word that you can do the thing that you
[1:02:32] said you would do you can move in my
[1:02:34] midst Lord you can do it for me and I
[1:02:36] don't have to go here or there I can
[1:02:38] believe that you still God I can believe
[1:02:41] that you're still going to do your word
[1:02:43] said that that's the god that moves and
[1:02:46] he's allows us to see the Lord that I
[1:02:48] can still have faith in you there's many
[1:02:50] that's Fallen here or there but I said
[1:02:53] you can never lose faith in God because
[1:02:55] he's been too good and he's allowed us
[1:02:57] to continue to grow and continue to live
[1:03:00] and to continue to show us that Lord
[1:03:02] there's even more each and every day if
[1:03:04] you just read your Bible you'll learn
[1:03:06] something that you hadn't read before
[1:03:08] you'll realize that you know it gets
[1:03:10] better and better the longer that you
[1:03:12] live and the more that you you study and
[1:03:14] the more that you come to and say Lord I
[1:03:16] didn't read this but Lord I Thank you
[1:03:18] for this today Lord I didn't see this
[1:03:20] before but I thank you for this today
[1:03:23] and there something new that just might
[1:03:24] catch your attention that you can take
[1:03:26] God just a little bit more take him a
[1:03:29] little bit further cuz it's at his
[1:03:31] word and there's nothing that you may
[1:03:34] have gone through or nothing that you
[1:03:35] might have experienced that is not
[1:03:37] covered in his word that's not covered
[1:03:40] in his word doesn't matter how hard it
[1:03:42] is doesn't matter how difficult it is it
[1:03:44] doesn't matter how specific you think it
[1:03:46] is to you cuz sometimes you going a go
[1:03:50] through something and you think that I'm
[1:03:51] the only one but then if you read in the
[1:03:54] scripture you see what Elijah he went to
[1:03:56] God and he said the same thing he said
[1:03:58] Lord I'm the only one but when you came
[1:04:01] down and said no no no the Lord had to
[1:04:03] correct and say no there's 7,000 that's
[1:04:05] still worshiping me there's 7,000 that's
[1:04:08] still believing that's still believing
[1:04:10] in the way that you do so it's not just
[1:04:12] you he said there's some that haven't
[1:04:14] given up there's something that still
[1:04:16] take me at my word there's something
[1:04:18] that still takes the the moments to
[1:04:20] believe that I'm still God and I can do
[1:04:23] the impossible said that even though
[1:04:26] they have went through many things and
[1:04:29] they had understood these disciples had
[1:04:32] seen many works it wasn't until then
[1:04:34] that they that it changed their life it
[1:04:37] wasn't until then that said God might
[1:04:38] have done it just to show you that
[1:04:40] sometimes all it takes is the right word
[1:04:42] amen he all it takes is the right word
[1:04:45] at the right time to strike a seed and
[1:04:47] that seed will grow sometimes all it
[1:04:49] takes you can water seed and water seed
[1:04:52] but if you never put light on it it'll
[1:04:54] never grow if you never put it in the
[1:04:56] sun it'll never grow no matter how much
[1:04:59] you water it and water it and water it
[1:05:01] sometimes you can drown the seed you'll
[1:05:04] kill it but sometimes you got to have
[1:05:06] the sun to strike it to cause that seed
[1:05:09] to die and get in that ground and get in
[1:05:11] that soil to die and to cause a new
[1:05:13] light to spring up out of it amen if you
[1:05:16] ever watch the seed grow I encourage you
[1:05:18] to do it just plant one and look up and
[1:05:20] you you'll see it Sprout up if you water
[1:05:22] and and leave it in the sunlight but
[1:05:24] sometimes there's seeds that are planted
[1:05:26] that that have to hit the right
[1:05:29] atmosphere to grow they have to hit the
[1:05:31] right they have to hear the right words
[1:05:33] at the right time to cause it to strike
[1:05:36] something deep inside that say that's
[1:05:38] the truth that's right I believe and
[1:05:40] then they go on from there says
[1:05:42] sometimes you just want someone to catch
[1:05:44] one word amen one word and and and for
[1:05:48] them to for it to change their lives
[1:05:50] says sometimes they might not hear every
[1:05:52] word but if they get one word is it's
[1:05:56] enough to do something to sustain them
[1:05:58] to allow them to start hungering and
[1:06:00] thirsting after something else hungering
[1:06:02] and thirsting after something else and
[1:06:04] allow them that God will continue to
[1:06:06] work in their lives that God will
[1:06:08] continue to work in our lives and he'll
[1:06:10] show us more and take us deeper and
[1:06:12] allow us to grow closer to him that we
[1:06:14] can continue to believe you more and
[1:06:16] more and take you more and more at your
[1:06:18] word take you more and more at your word
[1:06:21] and sometimes it starts here but if you
[1:06:23] if you live and you continue to grow and
[1:06:25] continue to trust him you'll grow your
[1:06:28] faith will grow you'll grow and you'll
[1:06:30] take more of his word and you'll take
[1:06:32] more of his word that you you'd be like
[1:06:34] John you can eat the whole book and he
[1:06:36] came and he took the book but he said
[1:06:39] that that that you'll be able to have it
[1:06:42] all all you have to do is take him at
[1:06:44] his word yes amen and believe that he's
[1:06:47] God and he'll do greater in you than you
[1:06:50] can ever
[1:06:52] imagine yes Lord
[1:06:56] see cuz God's word is more powerful than
[1:06:59] anything else that you may have on this
[1:07:01] Earth amen anything else more powerful
[1:07:03] than the atomic bombs cuz when you pray
[1:07:06] to God and you take him at his word it
[1:07:08] can do things that those things can't do
[1:07:11] it can do things that that you never
[1:07:13] imagine because he's God he's the god
[1:07:16] that created all things so what makes
[1:07:19] you think that your thing is
[1:07:21] impossible what makes you think that
[1:07:23] your thing hasn't that that he hasn't
[1:07:26] covered it cuz God he allowed all these
[1:07:29] things to take place to show you that he
[1:07:31] was God he didn't allow these things to
[1:07:34] just happen by chance he said all my
[1:07:37] steps have been ordered by the Lord so
[1:07:39] he didn't allow you just to these things
[1:07:41] just to happen he allow these things to
[1:07:43] show you that I'm
[1:07:45] God and just wants you to get to a place
[1:07:48] to believe that all things are possible
[1:07:51] all you have to do is take me by Your
[1:07:53] Word by by my word and all things are
[1:07:56] possible because it's that thy words
[1:07:59] that the storms can cease it's that that
[1:08:01] my word that the trials can dissipate is
[1:08:04] that my word that the sicknesses can go
[1:08:07] away it's that my word that all these
[1:08:10] things that may happen to me can just
[1:08:12] dissipate and disappear because I'm God
[1:08:16] and there's nothing that I can't do I'm
[1:08:18] God and there's nothing that I can't
[1:08:20] deliver you from I'm God there's nothing
[1:08:23] that I can't heal you from there God
[1:08:26] that there's nothing that I can't create
[1:08:28] for you if you have a need there's
[1:08:30] nothing that I can't give to you cuz I
[1:08:32] promise to supply all your needs said
[1:08:35] that's what his word says all you have
[1:08:36] to do is take it and believe it and say
[1:08:39] that it's settled in me Lord I don't
[1:08:41] have to move on I don't have to go no
[1:08:43] further because Lord I'm going to take
[1:08:45] you at your word and believe that you
[1:08:47] can do it and if I believe that you can
[1:08:50] do it then I know that these things are
[1:08:52] happen I may not know how it will happen
[1:08:54] I may not know when it will happen but I
[1:08:56] know that it'll happen I know that it's
[1:08:58] going to take place
[1:09:00] because your word can't return into your
[1:09:03] Void your word can't come back to you
[1:09:06] without accomplishing what you sent it
[1:09:08] out to do so if you sent your word out
[1:09:11] and all I have to do is believe Lord let
[1:09:13] me believe so that these things may
[1:09:15] happen let me believe that you're the
[1:09:17] god that can save let me believe that
[1:09:19] you're the god that can deliver let me
[1:09:21] believe that you're the god that can
[1:09:23] heal you're the god that can create
[1:09:25] you're the god that can
[1:09:27] do exceedingly abundantly more than I
[1:09:29] can ask to thing because you're God Amen
[1:09:32] see that's all you that you have to do
[1:09:34] is take God that Lord if I need to be
[1:09:37] saved Lord I can believe that you died
[1:09:39] on the cross for my sins and that you
[1:09:41] can save me Lord I believe that you if I
[1:09:44] need the Holy Ghost I can believe that
[1:09:46] Lord you promised it to me and I can
[1:09:48] take it by your word that you would give
[1:09:50] it to me and you can do it for me today
[1:09:53] that's all that God wants you to do is
[1:09:54] just believe have faith that I'm God and
[1:09:57] I can do these things and they can
[1:09:59] happen for you all you have to do is
[1:10:02] come to him say Lord I Surrender and
[1:10:04] give up everything cuz sometimes you
[1:10:07] come to him and you say Lord I believe
[1:10:09] but you don't give it up you come to it
[1:10:12] but you don't want to give up this or
[1:10:13] don't want to give up that but God
[1:10:15] requires us all to give up everything
[1:10:18] you have to come to those cross RS in
[1:10:20] life that Lord I want to take you at
[1:10:21] your word but Lord I want to give up
[1:10:23] everything that I have and and Lord I
[1:10:25] want to take you at your word I want to
[1:10:27] take you that Lord you can deliver me
[1:10:30] you can do these things but Lord I have
[1:10:32] to give up these things but I can tell
[1:10:34] you it's worth giving up it's worth you
[1:10:37] giving up these things to get what God
[1:10:39] has for you it's worth you sacrificing
[1:10:41] these things to get what God has for you
[1:10:44] it's worth you laying down your life to
[1:10:47] what you think you may achieve in this
[1:10:48] world to get what God has for you it's
[1:10:52] worth you saying Lord Lord I I want to
[1:10:55] lay these things down because there's
[1:10:57] nothing God has never done anything to
[1:11:00] anybody that caused them to say that God
[1:11:02] wasn't good to him amen God has never
[1:11:04] done anything to anybody to say that you
[1:11:07] know that wasn't a good decision so
[1:11:10] people may turn to left right but they
[1:11:12] don't say that God wasn't good to them
[1:11:13] or that wasn't a good decision said
[1:11:16] things may happen that cause people to
[1:11:18] do this or do that but anytime you get
[1:11:20] to him you realize that God is still
[1:11:22] good amen and God is still the one that
[1:11:25] come to when they need help they'll turn
[1:11:27] around and say Lord I need you they
[1:11:29] might have turned to the left but when
[1:11:30] they get in a time of trouble they get
[1:11:32] down and say Lord I need you because
[1:11:34] they know that when they call on them
[1:11:36] that something happens they know that
[1:11:38] when they go to them something happens
[1:11:40] they know that when they get in
[1:11:42] desperation that they need God to show
[1:11:44] up on the scene God to show up on time
[1:11:47] cuz he promised to be there for him he
[1:11:48] said I never leave you nor forsake you
[1:11:50] and he promised to be there so no matter
[1:11:53] how bad the situation get they always
[1:11:55] know where to go back to
[1:11:57] am but why why go back to him when you
[1:12:00] don't have to leave them amen in the
[1:12:02] first place you don't have to leave them
[1:12:05] in the first place you can have them
[1:12:06] there right by your side you don't have
[1:12:08] to get in a state of desperation to feel
[1:12:11] God right next to you you can have them
[1:12:13] there walking beside you each and every
[1:12:15] day where when you get down and you say
[1:12:17] a prayer that you can hear him talk to
[1:12:19] you you can hear them and you can feel
[1:12:21] them right next to you because you know
[1:12:22] that God is with you am so when you step
[1:12:25] into the room you know that it's nothing
[1:12:27] that you've done but he's there with you
[1:12:29] he's guiding you he's leading you and
[1:12:32] sometimes you have to get down to dying
[1:12:34] out to yourself and letting go of
[1:12:36] everything so that you can get so close
[1:12:39] to him that he's with you there's
[1:12:41] nothing that's in you that's wrong
[1:12:42] there's nothing that's beside you that's
[1:12:44] wrong you said Lord I come and I
[1:12:46] Surrender everything to you you have to
[1:12:49] die down as Paul said I Die daily
[1:12:52] because every single day something may
[1:12:54] arise in you that cause you to forget
[1:12:56] sometime not to forget over the long but
[1:12:59] for a moment that he that God is there
[1:13:03] or or to not acknowledge that it's only
[1:13:05] by his grace that you're still there to
[1:13:08] acknowledge that it's only by his grace
[1:13:10] and his Mercy that you're able to do the
[1:13:12] things that you're able to
[1:13:14] do but all that I say and encourage you
[1:13:17] to do is take God at his word take him
[1:13:19] and believe that God will do exactly
[1:13:21] what he says believe on that God God has
[1:13:24] save you from your sins and deliver you
[1:13:26] from anything that you may be going
[1:13:28] through this morning
[1:13:30] [Applause]
[1:13:35] amen amen let us all
[1:13:49] stand and let us bow
[1:13:58] Lord Jesus we thank you for allowing us
[1:14:00] to come into your house and Lord just
[1:14:01] allowing us to be here and Lord we heard
[1:14:05] you speak about taking you at your word
[1:14:08] and Lord we want to continue to have
[1:14:10] faith in you and take you at your word
[1:14:12] Lord so that you'd move in our lives
[1:14:14] Lord we ask that you forgive us of
[1:14:16] anything that we said and done that
[1:14:18] wasn't like you and Lord take take over
[1:14:21] and move in such a mighty and a special
[1:14:23] way Lord
[1:14:25] at this time we ask that there's anyone
[1:14:28] that that is in need of
[1:14:30] Salvation and I believe that God is
[1:14:34] speaking to them this morning to take
