[34:34] and they returned
[34:37] 20 25 13 25 and they returned from
[34:41] searching the land
[34:44] after 40 days and they went
[34:49] and came to moses and aaron
[34:52] and to all the congregation of the
[34:55] children of israel
[34:56] and to the wilderness of peoria and
[34:58] kadesh
[35:00] and brought by the word unto them
[35:03] and unto all the congregation and showed
[35:06] them
[35:07] the fruit of the land and they told him
[35:11] and said we came into the land
[35:15] with it thou sinners
[35:18] and surely it flowed with milk
[35:22] and honey and this is the fruit
[35:25] of it nevertheless the people be strong
[35:30] they dwell in the land the cities are
[35:33] warm
[35:34] and very great and moreover we saw
[35:38] the children in it there so the giants
[35:42] and the the amalekites dwell
[35:46] in the land of the south and the
[35:48] hittites
[35:50] and the jedi sites and
[35:53] the amorites dwell in the mountain
[35:57] and the canaanites dwell by the sea
[36:00] and by the coast of jordan and
[36:04] caleb stealed the people before moses
[36:08] and said let us go up at once and
[36:12] possess it
[36:13] for we are well able to overcome it
[36:18] but the man that went up with him
[36:21] said we be not able to go up
[36:25] against the people for they are stronger
[36:29] than we
[36:30] and they bought up an evil report
[36:35] of the land which they search
[36:39] until the children will heal the saying
[36:42] the land
[36:43] through which we have gone to search
[36:47] is a land that eated up the inhabitants
[36:51] thereof
[36:52] and all the people that we saw
[36:55] in it are men of great stature
[36:59] and there we saw the giant
[37:03] the son of enoch which come of the
[37:07] giants
[37:08] and we were in our own sight
[37:11] as grasshoppers and
[37:14] so we were in their sight
[37:17] may god bless the reach towards you we
[37:20] receded
[37:23] this morning and i'm just praying and
[37:25] seeking the lord
[37:28] just thinking so many people that
[37:31] we see him come to the end of their
[37:33] journey
[37:35] and as we look at the journey of life
[37:38] it's so many people i'm so grateful that
[37:42] the journey that god has given us
[37:45] and chose us to walk i don't look back
[37:50] and said
[37:51] i regret the journey
[37:54] because a lot of times people you know
[37:59] they choose the wrong path
[38:03] and a lot of times because people choose
[38:06] the wrong
[38:06] path they go through a lot of hardships
[38:10] and difficulties
[38:12] and even at the end of that journey
[38:16] a lot of times you look at
[38:20] folks and they lie
[38:23] in the hospital or they lie
[38:27] at the funeral home and you're grateful
[38:31] that god
[38:34] he came and got you out of the rut and
[38:36] out of the mess you were in
[38:39] the journey that we would have taken the
[38:42] choice that we would have made
[38:44] if god grace and mercy wouldn't have
[38:46] been with us
[38:48] we all would have made the wrong
[38:50] decision
[38:51] and gone down the wrong path but it's
[38:54] only by the grace of god that he changed
[38:56] our course
[38:58] i don't know about you but i i my mind
[39:01] wasn't known
[39:03] you know the lord you know we we
[39:07] it was too much the world had to offer
[39:10] and i'm saying this morning what are you
[39:12] looking at
[39:15] what are you looking at
[39:18] you know what see because a lot of times
[39:22] it's
[39:23] it's because our eyes are focused
[39:27] focusing on the wrong thing
[39:32] and when we will focus on the wrong
[39:34] thing
[39:35] we don't know that a lot of times
[39:39] the devil have things hidden
[39:43] it makes everything look good on the
[39:46] outside
[39:47] but as you go down in
[39:51] as you really get hooked and you get on
[39:54] the wrong
[39:54] path you find out you know i made a
[39:58] mistake
[40:00] i chose the wrong path
[40:03] because where is this path leading me
[40:06] and what do i have what did i achieve
[40:08] was it worth it
[40:10] see a lot of times we don't we don't
[40:14] take
[40:14] stock or we don't value
[40:18] the decisions that we make we don't know
[40:21] the price we have to pay
[40:24] until it's too late
[40:28] i've come around and sat down with many
[40:31] at their death bed and sometimes they
[40:34] were young
[40:35] sometimes they were old sometimes they
[40:39] were miller age
[40:43] the thing that they all had in common
[40:47] at the time of crossing over nothing in
[40:51] this life matters
[40:55] everything that matters don't matter now
[41:00] because my end have come so nothing
[41:02] didn't
[41:03] nothing nothing is of value nothing that
[41:05] i i've achieved nothing that i have
[41:08] it it it don't even matter right now
[41:14] but you look at the one that's a
[41:15] believable and getting ready to cross
[41:17] over
[41:19] and they're saying you know
[41:23] you know i'm ready you know i'm ready to
[41:27] go to a better place
[41:28] now because i know what's waiting on me
[41:33] i know it's waiting on me it's a better
[41:35] it's a better life
[41:37] oh god got something better for me
[41:41] so i don't mind crossing over now
[41:43] because i want to stay here because
[41:45] i want to be with my family and the
[41:48] different ones i want to do more
[41:52] but i don't mind crossing over now
[41:55] my time has come i'm i i i i gladly
[41:59] move on
[42:04] brother and sister
[42:08] i want to say to you what are you
[42:11] looking at
[42:14] what do you see do you see
[42:18] where you're going
[42:23] you might see where you want to go
[42:28] you might see what you want to be
[42:31] and what you want to have
[42:35] it may not include jesus
[42:40] it may exclude the word of god
[42:44] but one thing about it when you come to
[42:46] the end of that road you would wish
[42:52] that the choice i made wasn't my choice
[42:54] but it was his choice
[42:58] you know because somebody's controlling
[43:00] you
[43:01] one way or another
[43:04] if it's not god then it's the devil
[43:09] you're not amen the choices you make
[43:12] you're saying
[43:13] uh i'm gonna trust
[43:17] oh yeah we believe within ourselves that
[43:20] it's my decision i mean
[43:23] yes it's your decision but you've been
[43:27] influenced
[43:31] you've been influenced by spirits
[43:36] spirits and demons they're there
[43:39] influencing you telling you
[43:43] oh you've got to make

[44:26] the wrong thing

[44:40] song
[44:42] whose report will you believe amen
[44:46] and uh we find that joshua sent them out
[44:50] despite the land and they come back
[44:53] and they come back with the evil report

[45:22] and see where the line
[45:24] i want you to go inspired out they come
[45:26] back

[45:36] bless you
[45:38] you know i got so many blessings i'm
[45:40] gonna give to you

[45:46] morning you got your health you got your
[45:48] strength you got everything
[45:50] god gives you that
[45:53] and then he tells you you know if you
[45:55] seek first the kingdom of god and his
[45:57] righteousness
[45:58] and all other things i'm going to add to
[46:00] you i'm going to give you
[46:02] god you can't be god-given amen
[46:06] god got so many blessings stored up for
[46:08] you
[46:10] reserved for you amen
[46:14] but the devil is so enticing that he can
[46:19] really oh i'm going to tell you
[46:22] something
[46:22] if the devil could actually deceive
[46:26] a third of the angels in heaven don't

[46:38] in other words
[46:40] amen heaven gonna be ours we're gonna
[46:42] take over
[46:44] and they believed that they was gonna
[46:46] take over and that the devil
[46:48] lucifer was gonna make things better for
[46:50] him
[46:52] are you with me and you know sometimes
[46:55] people don't believe
[46:56] lucifer exists
[47:00] uh they don't believe that amen that
[47:03] there are spirits that are influencing
[47:05] all they think
[47:05] is you know it's me it's all about me
[47:08] and i
[47:09] and they just think uh you know i'm in
[47:11] control
[47:13] wake up in the morning if you wanna well
[47:16] i can wake myself up in the morning oh
[47:19] i don't need no alarm clock i wake up if

[47:56] broken leg
[47:59] you know what i'm saying it's so many
[48:02] times our success and what we think
[48:04] how great we are it don't take by the
[48:07] moment just to flip that switch
[48:11] and when the switch is flipped then you
[48:15] you realize how how frail you are
[48:20] and so by the grace of god let me just i
[48:24] don't want to
[48:25] i'm taking too long but
[48:29] here the lamb was just like god
[48:34] said it was but there was other
[48:36] obstacles there
[48:38] that they were looking at
[48:43] and i'm gonna say there are other
[48:45] obstacles that
[48:46] you might be looking at the things that
[48:50] you're looking at
[48:53] and i i wrote down a few things that
[48:56] folk would look at
[48:58] let me go to uh before i go there let me
[49:01] go to the
[49:02] first time you're 17 and um

[49:31] man hard fail because of him
[49:35] god's servant will go out and fight the
[49:37] philistine
[49:39] now david probably was about five feet
[49:43] tall maybe
[49:45] you know and goliath stood up
[49:48] a big old giant nine feet nine
[49:51] tall about a toll
[49:55] almost reached the ceiling
[49:58] and you little okay
[50:02] this giant this giant was a
[50:06] train his name was goliath
[50:10] and just think how big his sword was
[50:14] probably taller than david was
[50:18] and this giant was uh uh uh
[50:22] all of israel they had
[50:25] helmets they had uh breastplates
[50:29] and they had shields and everything but
[50:31] this giant
[50:32] oh can you he had a weaver beam
[50:36] a big old steel ball i mean
[50:39] probably with spikes coming out of it
[50:43] and he said all right israel
[50:47] y'all i'll fight y'all if y'all beat me
[50:51] if anybody y'all got to convi with me uh
[50:56] we'll worship y'all

[51:02] y'all best then y'all got to worship us
[51:09] y'all got to serve us in other words are
[51:12] you with me
[51:13] and he said he defied the
[51:16] god of israel
