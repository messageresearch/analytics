god that loves you guess what if he loves you that means he gonna take care of you he gonna establish you amen set you up upon a rock hallelujah glory to god hallelujah amen we're going to look in the book of isaiah this morning 61st chapter hallelujah amen we're not going to try to be before you long this morning uh just so many things that we could say but the lord just laid upon my heart maybe to have a different type of service we know so much is going on in the land uh we know it's been been a tough year on a lot of people amen there's been a lot going on i know it's been a tough year for this church amen and i know there's been a lot of loved ones going off the scene amen and we praying for you all they may be praying for you brother amen and we love you all and you know we had a tough time uh over the past year we lost sister blue and different things and you know maybe i just want to take a different direction this morning amen and just go towards the service of healing amen and towards a service of restoration you know it's a lot of things we could teach but you know the lord just laid upon our heart to just go this direction this morning amen and look to him for restoration amen we understand we could talk about a prophet of god if you're a bible reader you know isaiah 61 is a prophecy and jesus christ comes on the scene and the natural amen and he he actually reads the first part of isaiah 61 he reads it in the synagogue one morning he gets to the point that talks about him then he closes the book and then said he sits down and says this day the scripture is fulfilled so there was a a portion that he fulfilled in his first coming but there's also some promises for the people of god in this second coming and all i'm coming to do this morning is just remind you everything that god already promised you what he said in the word and we know his word is true amen then we go on from there isaiah 61 1 it reads this morning the spirit of the lord god is upon me to god how many can say that this morning the spirit of the lord god is upon me amen amen people got a lot of spirits running rampant on them nowadays but if god has blessed you with his spirit amen that spirit is above all those other spirits the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek amen that's the good news i mean there's a lot of bad news going on but we preaching good news this morning man he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted amen to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound amen prison is a bad predicament but he can open up the prison this morning to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord amen and then when jesus was in his natural ministry he stopped right there because that's what he was there to do in his first coming amen the rest of this is going to apply to the second coming to the third coming amen so he proclaimed a separated law and now he's talking about end the day of vengeance about god you know the enemy looked like he went in a lot right now amen but god is going to get his vengeance and that's what the word says you don't have to worry about it god says he's going to do it amen the defense of our god to comfort all that mourn amen that's a promise to appoint unto them that mourn in zion amen he was talking about natural zion natural jerusalem back then but but how many know we the new jerusalem amen to point out them that mourning zion to give unto them beauty for ashes amen that's what we're going to draw emphasis on this morning because what you're going to see in this next part is is what god is gonna do he's gonna do a switch around it's certain things that you start out with but then he promises other things on the other half amen so he says he's gonna give unto them beauty for ashes he's going to give you the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness hallelujah the planting of the lord that he might be glorified amen our title this morning is going to be beauty for ashes amen let's just buy hairs this morning in a word of prayer beauty for ashes father god in the name of jesus lord you brought your people out here this morning lord and lord you brought us here with an anointing dear god we thank you for that anointing lord we thank you for the song song lord each and every believer lord that press their way out to the service lord because we got one objective and that's to lift up your name father lord i pray that you're blessed and strengthened the saints and the servants this morning their god lord would you bless them by the preaching of your word dear god lord all of these things are being vain except you blessed by the word lord but you promise to do it dear god lord you gave us a message lord that is special to us dear god it's allowed your people to stand it's allowed your people to be firm dear god lord we pray to your blessed brother simmons lord as he's on his travels lord may he come back strengthen and renew to god bless his family to god maybe the ones who couldn't make it hit today law but they're streaming by the way of technology lord may you bless them this morning lord we look to you lord because you are to give all things dear god we worship you we worship you alone in the lovely name of jesus christ let the same say amen this morning hallelujah you can be seated this morning you know as we go through the years and and you spend more time with the lord you you get understanding of exactly uh who he is and and how he has a way of operating sometimes and what we find is that god is a simple god amen brother branham say he hides himself in simplicity amen but at the same time in simplicity we find that there are ways that god unfolds himself amen he unfolds himself he he wants to be able to manifest himself as a healer so he allows people to get sick sometimes he wants to be able to manifest himself as a comforter amen so so he allows things that happen that gets us uncomfortable sometimes he wants to manifest himself as being a provider so he gives you need from time to time and man he he wants to manifest himself as being jehovah sharma as somebody that is always with you so he has to allow you to feel alone from time to time what god does is he sets up circumstances and what those circumstances do it's not just that a breaker's down but it's there for almighty god to unfold himself amen because he has things that he wants to express amen he has desires amen he has ways that he wants to reveal himself unto you amen amen and what we find out with god is god is a progressive god amen amen progressive means that sometimes things look like they start out slowly sometimes it look like you could barely get one foot in front of the other but if you stick with them and if you stick under the teaching of the word amen what the word do is it'll start to strengthen you what the word do is it'll start to establish you it'll allow you to grow and allow you to move forward and even when things going on that might be a misunderstanding and hard to understand we start to get that revelation that paul said in romans 8 28 that we know that all things work together amen we know that all things work together for the good amen to those that love the lord amen the ones that are called according to his purpose amen and and see it it takes a progression in your revelation to be able to say that amen because there's some things that go on and it does not look like those things are working together amen but if the scripture said it amen and we know our god is a progressive god he has to make his word come to pass amen can i get amen for somebody this morning amen i hope that you're with me this morning and and sometimes when it seems like the lord is breaking down things around us amen he's using those things to build us up on other side amen and sometimes when we go through a situation amen sometimes it's to prepare us for the next situation amen and sometimes it's to prepare us for the situation after that amen but our god has already promised that we got the victory in all things amen through jesus christ hallelujah how many of the lord this morning now with us being christians amen and us taking on the name of christ amen and us having salvation under the name of christ we got to understand this morning that there are promises that come under the name of christ amen jesus christ when he came here he came here for a purpose glory to god and one of the things that we read here under isaiah 61 when jesus christ was on the scene and he stood up in the synagogue amen that morning to to read what the word already said about him he started to talk about the freedom that will come in christ amen hallelujah i see this hook right here man he he he start to talk about the purpose that he came from and if you could grab ahold of the purpose amen if you could be blessed with the revelation to see the purpose amen he said and he came to make sure that you are free in a time where people are bound they bound physically they bow mentally they bound emotionally but jesus christ already spoke better things over you he came to make sure that you are free amen and yeah we talk about freedom on the other side we talk about our rewards coming into heaven amen but i'm here to tell you that god has given you your freedom now man he's giving you a portion of your inheritance to have right now and when people are all worried amen and when people are all concerned and stressed out and perplexed almighty god has already said amen he's came to preach good tidings amen good tidings is the good news of the gospel all we see in the news is bad news all over the place amen bad news about the virus say man bad news about loved ones oh my every time i talk to the people back home and something else going on amen so much bad news amen bad news in the political realm in afghanistan all those things it's just a bunch of bad news but you know we got good titans here this morning and sometimes you got to focus on the good tidings amen that's the good news i mean the good information you got to focus on those things because those are going to be the things that are going to keep you amen isaiah 61 amen i'm a simple preacher man i just like to point and shoot and let the word speak for itself amen he said the lord has anointed me to preach good times and to the meat he has sent me to bind up the broken heart today man you know a broken heart is a thing that's not easy to fix say man a broken heart is something that man's medicine i mean man could give you some medicine to help you out amen but that still can't fully fix a broken heart amen a broken heart amen is a tough thing it's a terrible thing amen but we got somebody who can bind up the broken heart today man the great physician the way he operates with his surgery amen when he comes in amen he can bind up the pieces of the broken heart amen that's a promise that he gave amen we can't do it on our own man can't do it but almighty god promised that he could do it amen he said if you're a captain of amen he can give you liberty if you're in prison he can open the doors of the prison house amen that's what he came to do that's what he established in his first coming and everybody that accepted the name of jesus christ amen everybody took time to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus on acts 2 38 amen you submitted yourself over to him those are promises that he's already given you those are promises he's already blessed you with you take the promise of god and you keep moving forward in it amen but then he starts to move amen from the first portion of his ministry where he at the end amen if you read it in luke 4 about luke 4 18 luke 4 19 is where you find this thought in the new testament amen and he ends the thought right there amen but now there's a a greater opportunity amen for us in these last days amen for us who's living in the time of his second coming amen and we had to preach to you amen the second coming of christ is on now amen and there's promises that that he gives you in the second coming amen how do we know the second coming of christ is all night man because he's hearing you this morning amen you reveal him out everywhere that you go amen everywhere that you travel amen how you dress how you conduct yourselves amen you showing that jesus christ is here again amen and he promised he would come a minute he's already here and operating so in the second coming amen he talks about van just saying man we mention those things amen but in isaiah uh uh 62 and and and two amen as we get past today avengers say man he says that he's going to comfort all that morning man you know it's been a time a great morning they've been over the last year or two but you know he said he would be a confident amen matthew 5 4 he says bless the day the morning amen for the shall be comforted amen and see i'm here to remind you that this morning because see we need that from him amen there will be things that go on that will cause us to mourn there will be heartaches that go on that cause us to mourn amen but in the midst of all of those things i'm here to remind you this morning he said that he would be here to be a confidant and i'm rested on the word of god this morning amen see once he establishes those things amen and as you go through things and as he has the things that it seems like the enemy has put in and things that uh the enemy seems like he's put on your track amen what almighty god is doing he's upgrading those things amen he's doing a swap around hey man the sisters they meant sometimes you like to get your car upgraded hey man the lord blessing some of y'all i mean you're getting your houses upgraded amen and if you can get things upgraded in the natural amenities they love to get their hair upgraded amen lord of god amen come in one way a minute and come out another way man and it don't be no no five and ten dollar head some of those things are very expensive i'm starting to learn about those things amen because we like to be upgraded amen so so so if i if man naturally is in the business upgrading amen how much more can god show up that he isn't the best upgrade now what the scripture is saying for zion amen for jerusalem amen and we are new jerusalem amen the book of revelation says that city came down like a bride of dawn for a husband amen so we manifest not south as new jerusalem so the scripture is saying that for the people of jerusalem amen uh for the people of new jerusalem he he's gonna do some upgrading he's gonna do some switching around the first thing he mentions amen i'm gonna give unto them beauty for ashes amen and and that's a curious thing to say beauty for ashes what does that mean you know we all go through periods of time amen where it seems like it's just nothing but ashes amen the ashes are the burn over things of your life amen the things that the fire has done the rage and the fires done ravaged and one point in time it was green trees and green leaves and everything was looking good but because the fire was so rough and violent they man and fire is so indiscriminate all the fire has left behind its ashes amen those ashes ain't even know those those worn down things in life though those burn over things and like see sometimes we get in the ashes well some when job was was going through his issue job was on the ash heap amen the ashes are the low point amen the parts that you would throw away man there's ways they mean there's no it's no good that comes out of ashes amen but you know god says in the midst of your ashes amen i got something for you amen i got beauty for your ashes amen you know i like the word beauty man because he's the fairest of ten thousand i mean everybody's looking for beauty man the sisters want beauty i mean even the brothers want beauty amen because they want a beautiful young lady or something like that amen we all looking for beauty amen but the lord says amen he got a different kind of beauty for you and it comes from your ashes amen there's beauty in the holiness of god amen it's a psalm that says beauty and the brokenness amen there's beauty from the ashes amen and there might be a point in time where you start out with ashes but god said i'm not gonna just let you stay there with ashes i'm gonna build you up again and i'm not just gonna build you from ashes to halfway i'm going to build you from ashes to a state of beauty amen i'm going to put something on you amen that nothing else in this world will be able to touch amen i'm going to give you beauty for ashes the ashes amen if you look at numbers the 19th chapter and the ashes are actually a part of your sacrifice to me numbers 19 amen the lord he talks about uh the sacrifice that the people of israel needed to give amen and numbers 19 what it talks about is it talks about the red heifer and the red half of what the people were supposed to do amen was that the the priest was supposed to come in and get this red hair for it man it had to be a a red hat for that it did not have any spot did not have any blemish never had a yoke upon it amen it had to be perfect and actually what they would do is they would take the red half outside the camp sacrificed the heifer burn it amen and the ashes were but something special from that red half of that they burned amen brother branham picks up the thought amen and think of mansfield 1965 amen he said when israel sinned and recognized they had done wrong then they were sprinkled with the ashes of this half upon him amen and that was a water of separation a purification for city man so what happened in the midst of their ashes they meant to miss that bad thing it was actually a purification it was actually a separation from san francis the ashes were something that were used to get them closer to their god again amen so what he does amen even for you and your ashes amen those things are used to bring you closer to the lord again amen and he said you might be at a low point you might be battling some things right now but he promised your beauty on the other side and you got to accept what almighty god has already given you amen he mentions another thing in the scripture amen the or of joy for mourning amen the all the joy for mourning you know some people in in the midst of uh uh of battling amen and grinding against the enemy you see how people lose the joy of their salvation sometimes amen but you know he's a restorer of joy this morning amen he said it might be some morning amen there's things that go on that make you mourn amen but he said he won't just leave you there in the state of mourning he said i got something for you sure is the period of mourning sure there's broken hearts there's there's heaviness there's things that we have to overcome but what he's going to do to help you with that morning amen he said that i'm going to give you the all of joy amen there's something special about jo about all this morning amen oil is a part of the anointing amen you know that we use all for anointing even you know that we use oil they mean all is a a portion of fuel amen if we was to take some oil this morning no matter if it's a cooking oil a mortar oil and we set that all on fire let me tell you something saints that oil will burn amen because all is flammable amen all is combustible and if almighty god blesses you with the oil of joy there's always going to be something deep down on the inside of the inside amen and it ain't so much about you but it's about the all the joy that he's giving you amen that day even when the chimps are down even when things are going on amen show us some mourning amen but almighty god when he blessed you with the all the joy that's what allows you to continue amen to all the joy is what has allowed the saints of god to be able to stand amen because god gave you a portion of that all amen that's your anointing and i'm here to tell you this morning the devil cannot take that away from you amen hallelujah glory to god the book of revelation that lets us know in the prophet of god broke it down to us underneath the third seal underneath that black horse rider amen as the white horse rider was there and the red horse rider said when you get to the thorough black hole friday man he starts to talk about how he would not be able to hurt the oil not a wine amen and what almighty god does does is he stood on the scene amen and he commanded the enemy amen sure you might be wrecking havoc amen so you might be trying to do a lot of stuff but you will never be able to hurt the oil amen and you'll never be able to hurt the wine amen what did the prophet let us know it meant that the oil was the holy spirit amen and the holy spirit in you amen it establishes you amen it is strengthens you amen the prophet of god said once the holy spirit is on you amen and god supplies you with each and everything that you need through the holy spirit all you got to do is keep drinking and pushing out amen keep drinking and pushing out he was the enemy was commanded not to be able to hurt not the oil not a wine amen he cannot touch that portion that he you have and you amen he cannot touch that portion of the spirit that almighty god has blessed you with amen and we know the wine ain't been that stimulation by revelation amen he can't touch the wine amen if god has blessed you with a revelation amen if god has blessed you amen that you got an understanding of a word for your day man then no matter what comes no matter what goals amen nothing is going to move you from that word amen because it's been revealed i'll tell you amen and the revelation it gives us stimulation amen the revelation it makes us come back out to the service again amen the revelation i mean it keeps us in the word amen the revelation it keeps us moving forward when the world is going in the complete opposite direction if you have sipped on the wine of jesus christ and have had the opportunity to be stimulated by the revelation amen it don't matter what everybody else says do it because you got a revelation it don't matter what the rest of your family is doing it don't matter what the rest of your co-workers are doing amen when almighty god gives you a revelation you are established amen it settles you down and it's going to cause everything to be all right amen you know he said he gave you to all the joy man and i don't read no portion in there with all the joy that's gonna run out for the people of god even see you know people said i like to smile a lot while i preach amen but that's cause i'm feeding off to all the joy man you know even on your bad days if you get reminded that he promised you with the all the joy man it's gonna even everything out for you it's to allow everything to be all right you know one of the last things that he mentioned amen and i like it amen is he says i'm going to give you the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness amen now what i'm learning is i talk to people amen as i navigate through life and get a little old amen and getting middle-aged nightmare and getting from being a young man amen you're a young man until you turn forward and then after that hey man you middle-aged man and once you're six-year-old man amen so i'm still a young man but i'm bomb barely holding on amen about three about god's grace and we gonna keep moving forward but what you find out amen as you move amen there are a lot of spirits that people have to deal with amen and you know especially as you talk to people amen and even people on the job they find your minister or family finds you a mental statement a lot of spirits people have to deal with there's a lot going on amen one of the things that people have to deal with is a spirit of heaviness amen you know heaviness can be a spirit image and when a spirit of heaviness gets on somebody man they don't work well oh my had a situation to work but it was arguing with each other i had to deal with that amen but that's because people were dealing with spirits of heaviness amen and what happens is spirits of heaviness get on people and in the natural world or cause people will seek alcohol they see drugs they seek a new boyfriend or girlfriend amen all these things to try to get over the spirit of heaven it's their last shot at people amen and there's a lot of things you could try to do naturally but but but if that spirit of heaviness is on you that is something that is hard to break my god is hard to break but see almighty god said i know that things will get on you from time to time that'll be heavy amen i i i i know that that things that get on you from time to time amen that will be a burden to you amen so so the lord amen when he was on the scene in matthew 11 amen he said bring me your burdens amen he said come on to me amen oh you that labor and a heavy lady and what he said i give you rest see the problem is people are struggling with rest amen not just rest naturally a minute and me as a pharmacist i give out a ton of sleeping pills amen so people can have rest say man people need that sometimes i mean that's the age that we're living in amen but i'm talking about a different type of rest this morning that he can provide you with some rest for your soul amen he said that you might got a yoke that's on you amen that is a burden that's on you that is the spirit of heaven and saving but what he says is is cast your cares upon him amen he said learn to me take a maya okay man his yoke is different from our yoke amen his yoke is easy and his burdens amen those burdens are light what we have to do amen to move past the spirit of heaviness come unto him give it over to jesus he wants to be able to to be your problem solve amen he wants to be able to be the one that holds you up when you're feeling down he wants to be the one who brightens your candle so you can stand as a light in the midst of a wicked and dark generation you can still stand as a believer and show that there's a real god you can find him in his word there are people that's out there they are still fulfilling the word of god they walk differently they talk differently they act differently they they move forward they still cast the devil out amen there's still salvation in the name of jesus christ you can't do that holding on to your own burden amen but there's an answer out there for the spirit of heaviness amen glory to god you know i like what he gives you for the spirit of heaviness he said for the spirit of heaviness amen let me read it to you this morning i'm going to give you the comment of praise god oh hallelujah amen [Applause] you know something about the garment of praise amen and the garment of praise is more than the nice suits that the brothers got on amen the garment of praise is more than the nice dresses that the sisters got going on amen the government of praise is something that i wear every day man the coming of praise is something that you got on the inside of the inside amen even though the lord might give and the lord are taken away but blessed be the name of the lord amen see job had a comment of praise in the midst of his struggle amen in the midst of the shrine the government of praise will always allow you no matter what comes no matter what goes you're still going to be praising god you're still going to be thanking god because see you know the devil don't got the final say so but jesus christ he has the final say so amen glory to god you know saints when i wake up in the morning i wake up with my garment of praise on amen when i go to work i go to work with my garment of praise on when i come to church i come to church with my garment of praise on you know sometimes i feel like the saints have forgotten about that garment of praise but god don't want you just going around on moses does he want you praising him amen for what he's already done amen for what he's going to do for you and what he's doing for you right now amen hallelujah amen you got a redeemer that's holding you a man and wherever you go whatever you do saying y'all keep on that garment of praise amen don't ever let nobody look at you amen and you looking like you on the ass sheep amen and sure there's a spirit of heaviness amen the spirit of heaviness is out there but he said that he will bless you amen with the garment of praise amen for that spirit of heaviness i mean how many love him this morning [Applause] now he has all these promises and things amen are we drawing to a close this morning we're not going to keep you all morning amen he has all of these promises and things here amen to bring us under something amen he says the point unto them that mourn inside amen to give unto them beautiful ashes amen beauty for your ashes to all the joy for mourning amen the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness why that they might be called trees of righteousness amen the planting of the lord amen that me he might be glorified even that we might be called trees of righteousness amen you know when god does the planning of the tree amen it establishes you amen but psalms one amen that his leaf shall not wither amen whatever you do shall prosper i mean should be like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen when god plants you as a tree amen your root structure is different amen when god plants you as a tree amen and you know some trees they man i'm from the low country man and what i've noticed is it can be some giant trees out there and we had a lot of hurricanes over the last 10 years or so and some trees that are very big and very strong i mean it would be surprising at the end of the storm that those trees would be blowed over i mean that thing was surprising boy that's a big tree and when something like wind could blow nothing but air could blow on that big tree and knock it over but what happens when you look at the root structure of the tree amen you notice that the tree has shallow roots as big and as large as the tree was because the tree did not have roots that went deep in the ground it just had a lot of superficial roots say man and that's what happened with a lot of christians they got a lot of superficial roots on the outside to look good on the outside praise the lord everything all right amen but see nothing never get down deep and get established and when the storm starts to blow a man you gonna need something that gets down deep amen and that and that will establish you amen so it will be trees that on the outside from me looking at the top of the tree i thought that that tree would not be strong enough to withstand the storm amen but that tree that did not look so good from the ground up amen it was able to withstand the storm and man because his root system was different amen see saints your root system is different amen when you come out to church or two three times a week amen what it's doing is this establishing your root system when you dig into the word amen and you follow the things that the prophet of god is shoulder say man what those things do is they establish a root system amen and that way when the wind blows you will still be able to stand amen now if the wrong person planted you amen you're not going to be able to withstand these storms but i'm here to remind you who planted you this morning almighty god planted you today man if almighty god planted you amen that means almighty god is gonna sustain you amen if he sustained you amen he planted you that mean he gonna water you amen when you need water he's gonna give you sunshine when you need sunshine amen if you need growth he's gonna give you growth amen because you are history of righteousness you are the planting of the lord you are special unto him this morning amen there might be a lot of conditions that's out there on the scene that might try to keep the planting of the lord from growing and from prospering but i'm here to tell you this morning that god uses all those things for his glory amen amen i'm gonna tell you a quick story on the way out amen when i was looking at different plants and different conditions and things amen you know plants we all know plants need sun and water they need special conditions amen but certain plants need more than that man there's a plant called a tulip a man a flower called a tulip it man it's very beautiful flower a minute your brother's not familiar with him and get your wife some tulips she'll love it amen but you know the thing about a tulip is just because it gets planted amen and gets planted maybe in the uh some fall or whatever with a tulip it actually needs a certain amount of cold weather in order for it to be able to go in the springtime if it don't get like those six or twelve weeks of cold enough weather it's not gonna grow in the springtime what happens is it needs certain conditions in order for it to be able to grow and manifest itself amen and you would think well why would a plant need a certain amount of winter time to be able to grow again in the summertime that's just how god ordered it amen so sometimes when we're going through wintertime amen in our lives i mean we're going through wintertime spiritually and naturally and we wonder how we're going to get growth out of those things if god can use that winter time to bring forth a tulip amen how much more can he use your winter time to bring forth something out of your life amen [Applause] it got to have in a couple weeks of winter amen but then it needs that spring to come amen and the spring comes again amen and the summer comes again and it blossoms and it blooms amen and it manifests itself amen he does all of those things amen scripture says he does all of these things that he might be glorified amen the scripture amen is he taking you through all these things a minute they might be called trees of righteousness the planning of the lord that he might be glorified amen you know we get to the point amen when we start to understand that everything in your life amen even the things that look shaky even confusing amen that god still use those things to get the glory out of you amen it's a mystery man but he uses those things that he might be glorified the most important thing that we can do as the creation of almighty god is glorify him as being something that worships him as being something that lives a life that that's desiring and pleasing unto him amen the angels couldn't necessarily worship him like we worshipping amen because he's done something different for us amen and he brings us through all of those things amen that he might be glorified amen that we might move into his image amen that we be conformed into the image of the son amen that's what happened after romans 8 28 romans 8 29 says that we could be conformed into the image of his son amen after we know that all things work together those who are to call them and those that love them amen then we get conformed to the image of the son he does all of these things amen that we could be in his image amen that we can manifest more of the character of god amen that he could be glorified that there will be a people that no matter what goes on they hold on to the word amen that they will have that jacob mentality that i will not let you go until you bless me amen that they will have the mindset that they will hold on that they will recognize that the word of god is their absolute amen and the thing about the absolute is is you try other things and once you find out that those things don't hold and when the storm blows over your life and you reach out and you hold on to almighty god and you hold on to the word of god and at the end of the storm you find out that you are still standing what that reveals out to you is that almighty god is the absolute for you amen and the absolute it holds on amen the absolute when you tried everything else that you know that this thing is secure you don't got nowhere else to go you could be like heeded to alone where else would we go you alone got the words of eternal life baby he's our absolute this morning amen he does these things for our glory amen it starts out with hard things amen beautiful for our ashes hey man you might have some ashes amen but it gives us beautiful ashes amen there might be more than amen but he promised you the oil of joy amen it might be a spirit of heaviness but he said he'll give you the garment of praise amen and then right before we go as we close amen you know the pride for the guy he tells a story amen how he was walking in british columbia amen up in canada and he was walking uh through the woods and walking on different trails and things and he was kind of getting in a far area and he was saying brother brown was saying you know lord why would you get me out to this area you know it's it's kind of unusual and what end up happening he gets out to an area where there is a bunch of burnt over trees from a forest fire man and there's all of these old burn over uh ugly looking trees amen and it's real he said it was real spooky looking and he didn't understand why would god lead him all the way out here to see all these burnover trees that just look just look awful it looked terrible and what happened the wind started to blow through those trees and those old burn over trees and then with the ashes on them all those trees would do was just moaning man they just moan as the wind blew through and the prophet of god he meant while he was out there he was he was asking the lord why would you bring me out here why would you allow me to see those things say man and something caught his attention hey man as he was looking at those burnt over trees that just had the ash and it was just out there moaning and groaning man he started to look down and he could start to see the green that was going up again amen and he started to see some of those young trees amen that was green and he said it was something different about those young trees i mean they were all limber and they had green leaves on them and as the wind blew through them amen they had their garment of praise on they was praising god amen they was whistling they was rejoicing and he said lord now i got the understanding amen that you don't want me just focusing amen on those burnover trees amen but you are showing that you are restored amen you are showing hallelujah that you are still moving in the midst that in the midst of the fire amen that in the midst of the ashes you are rising something up again amen that you are still being a sustained amen you know if the lord has raised you up amen praise the man be like those little trees amen show that you are still a blessed as a son and daughter of god amen those little trees amen even though all the circumstances happen all around them they had something to praise their god for amen and all they could do was bless them amen and thank them amen and praise the lord amen and give them the glory amen the lord even though the fire raged amen even though there's ashes all over the place and all over the scene you are still able to give us beauty for our ashes amen and as the lord gives you that beauty for those ashes amen manifest that beauty amen manifest yourself as the son of god manifest yourself as a daughter of god he's made you beautiful in his image amen and his likeness and we can display that to the world amen in the midst of our perverse and crooked generation amen i'm gonna love the lord this morning hallelujah glory to god let's just buy our heads amen lord we just grateful to you this morning dear god that no matter what comes lord no matter what goals lord you are here for us there guy lord even though there are some ashes from time to time lord we can't deny that lord even though there is mourning dear god even
