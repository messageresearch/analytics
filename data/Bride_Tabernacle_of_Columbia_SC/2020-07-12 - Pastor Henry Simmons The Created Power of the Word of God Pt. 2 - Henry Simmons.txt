praise God we thank the Lord even for amen we were ministering on Friday night the created power of the word of God God word has power to create we understand and Hebrews by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God the Bible says in Genesis warn in the beginning God created the heaven and earth and then the Bible says in the beginning in Saint John 1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God God said in Genesis and let there be light and there was light I want you to know that it tooks the Word of God to create the world and I as we look this morning at Colossians 1 again what God created in Genesis a world that was free of sin and sickness and chaos God began to recreate with his second item which what the Lord Jesus he began to recreate they met a man in His image and in his likeness and God introduced us to a new but it was they invisible God bringing the people to see the invisible so this morning as we look at the Creator we want to talk to you this morning concern seeing the invisible God of seeing the invisible Colossians 1 and 12 that reads giving thanks unto God giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be partakers I want you to know that your paw take us you're part of this that's happening in this generation and in the world in the dot would you happen by then your particles now the inheritance of the Saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son seeing the invisible that God blessed arena much worried but as I continue on I want you to understand the Wow cannot see God in it because he is the invisible God but you and I will worship God because we're looking until they I'd seen for it takes a faith to see God without faith you cannot see or you cannot understand God and John said it and is born again he cannot see I understand the kingdom of God the kingdom of God that you are particles are inherent his love that kingdom rather sister friends then seeing the invisible God is translated you and I and you might use the five senses he retains feel and so forth but we are talking about children that are on the sixth sense with all the faith seed of Abraham we're talking about children of faith that have entered into another dimension will entered into in the Noctis world but the kingdom of God that took the sixth sense to bring you into revelation and manifestation that God can vindicate who you are brother and sister your children from above you've been back from another world you've been back from heaven you are the children of the invisible God Paul Paul talks about it in Marcille he said unknown God he talked about they were easily a washer in him we live we move and we have our beads and he said because brethren I mean I want you to know that you are the upstream of that God that's invisible you are children of God here we says in the 14 verse and whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin hallelujah we have redemption through the blood of Jesus God had to redeem us back back to God but his image back to back knees back to God seeing the invisible brother sister who is the image running sister this is what Jesus the Bible say who is the image of the invisible God don't sound reasonable to man he meant the man cannot see the wind but they cannot see the effects of the wind when you see the trees MN o being tossed to and fro because the wind is blowing but I can't see the win but he win but the children of God to see because God had me provision for you and I that we might see the invisible God he said the firstborn of any creature for by him all things all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him amen and for him so by him all things and he is before all things and by him all things consist of the body the church the church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ how can this be that detaches the mystical body of Christ if it's a mystery it was a mystery that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself it's a mystery the crisis in Utah and healed the hope of glory he's hid in [Music] what he said we have this project I'm a gospel be hid it's here to do that allows and whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not believe that see when you believe you can look to not see you can see the glory of God you can enter into the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is for believers for though they were take home the faith it's a god I believe that you all for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him see evil oh why he may be found call ye upon him why he knew I said God is here God is here to meet your every need but you must see him he's the head of the body the church who is the image who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence some folks don't want God to have preeminence in their life I said let God if you only recognize who he is you must let the word of God have the preeminence in your life amen you must extreme God as you hate because he is the head of the body the church and you must give him that respect and that reverence that I'm not my own head they meant Christ is the head of the church even as the husband is the head of the wife even and you must be subject unto Him who is your head they meant brother his sister recognize that you can look this morning look to the unseen look for your children of God by faith in Christ Jesus your children of faith you're not add this world they need not add this world God says that you are sons and daughters of God so don't let the world even claims on you invisible God what he's visible to you why are you cousin here we live we move we walk by
