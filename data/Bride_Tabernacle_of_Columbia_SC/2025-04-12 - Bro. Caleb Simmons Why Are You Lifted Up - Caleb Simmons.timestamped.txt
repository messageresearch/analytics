[34:58] danger, Lord. And I want to say thank
[35:00] you, Lord. In Jesus name, we pray. Amen.
[35:04] Hallelujah. Amen. If you got your
[35:07] Bibles, we'll turn to the book of First
[35:10] Corinthians.
[35:12] Hallelujah.
[35:16] 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[35:31] 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and we'll start
[35:33] in verse
[35:37] [Applause]
[35:40] 12. And when you got it, say amen.
[35:45] Amen. Lord have mercy.
[35:50] And it reads, "For as the body is one,
[35:54] it has many members, and all the members
[35:57] of that of that one body being membered
[36:01] are are one
[36:03] body, being many are one body, so also
[36:07] is
[36:07] Christ. For by one spirit are we
[36:10] baptized into one body, whether we be
[36:13] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[36:15] free, and have been made all made to
[36:18] drink into one spirit. For the body is
[36:20] not one member, but many. And if the
[36:23] foot shall say, because I am not the
[36:25] hand, I am not of the body, it is
[36:28] therefore, is it therefore not of the
[36:30] body? And if the ear shall say, because
[36:33] I am not the eye, I am not of the body.
[36:36] Is it therefore not of the body? And if
[36:39] the whole body were an eye, where were
[36:41] the where were the hearing? And if the
[36:44] whole were hearing, where was the where
[36:46] were the smelling? But now hath God set
[36:49] the members, every one of them, in the
[36:52] body, as it hath pleased him? And if
[36:55] they were all one member, where were the
[36:58] body? But now are they many members, yet
[37:02] one body? And the eye cannot say unto
[37:04] the hand, I have no need of thee. Nor
[37:07] again the head to the feet, I have no
[37:10] need of thee. Nay, much more those
[37:13] members of the body which seem to be
[37:16] more feeble are
[37:19] necessary. And those members of the body
[37:22] which we think to be less honorable,
[37:25] upon them we bestow more abundant honor.
[37:28] and our uncumbly parts have been more
[37:32] have more abundant comeliness. Amen. God
[37:35] bless the reading of this word. You may
[37:37] be
[37:40] seated. Tonight I'd like to speak on a
[37:43] topic that I
[37:47] entitled Why are you lifted
[37:50] up? Had to remember which one I gave
[37:52] him.
[37:54] Amen. Amen. Why are you lifted up? And I
[37:57] thought about this and when I was
[37:59] reading the scripture, it was very key
[38:01] to to remember that every piece of this
[38:04] body had a part to play.
[38:06] Every piece. There wasn't one piece that
[38:08] could say, "I don't need you." There
[38:11] wasn't one part of the body that that
[38:13] when you cut it off, you don't miss it.
[38:16] If you cut your finger, you you feel the
[38:18] pain because of what? It's a part of the
[38:20] body. Amen. If you cut your leg, you
[38:23] feel pain. Why? It's because it's a part
[38:25] of your body. If you cut your toe, if
[38:28] you stub your toe with and then you feel
[38:30] it. Why? It's a part of your body. Now,
[38:33] does your body have receptors in it to
[38:36] tell you, I feel pain. It's a nerve
[38:38] there, but there's nothing that can
[38:40] physically Oh, that's I hurt my foot.
[38:43] You had to have your brain to tell you
[38:44] that. Why? It's all connected. In the
[38:48] same way, it was just so precious to see
[38:50] how God created such a magnificent
[38:52] thing. Amen. And it's so and I started
[38:55] thinking about it and extrapolating it
[38:57] to the rest of the world and just seeing
[38:59] how God put the sun in the solar system.
[39:02] If it wasn't the sun and because of the
[39:04] gravitational pull of the sun, we the
[39:06] earth wouldn't be here. If it was too
[39:08] strong, we would be in the sun. If it
[39:10] was too weak, we would fly all apart.
[39:13] But you see, God had a purpose and a
[39:15] plan for putting us all together, for
[39:18] allowing us to be together and said, "I
[39:20] want you to be one body. Not many
[39:23] bodies, but one body. And each one of
[39:25] you are needed for a specific purpose."
[39:28] Amen. That I can't say I I I I'm greater
[39:31] than you because I'm the
[39:33] eye. Now, I can't say because I can see
[39:36] I'm better than your
[39:38] ear. And the ear can't say, "You know
[39:40] what? Because I can hear. I'm better
[39:42] than your
[39:43] mouth." And the leg can't say, "Hey, I'm
[39:46] better than you because I can move you
[39:48] places. I'm better than the arm because
[39:49] I can move you places." But you see,
[39:52] each part had a had a each one had a had
[39:55] a had a part to play. And if one was
[39:58] missing, which God could allowed it to
[40:01] be, I I made the example one time. I
[40:03] said, "If you only had one leg and
[40:05] that's how God created all of us to be,
[40:07] we would not think it was strange. We
[40:10] would have just thought it was this is
[40:12] the way it is." But because God gave us
[40:14] two when we only have one, you see a
[40:17] difference because it's not normal. But
[40:19] if that's how God would have created it,
[40:21] but God saw that he wanted things to be.
[40:23] I said, "God, he's something." He likes
[40:25] symmetry. And symmetry is where you
[40:28] split something in half and they both
[40:30] look the same.
[40:32] They both look the same. But God has a
[40:34] way of showing showing us that sometimes
[40:37] that you can't look at one thing less
[40:39] than less than the other. You got to
[40:41] look at them as equal parts. And
[40:44] sometimes that's hard because you can
[40:46] get in yourself. And I and I and I had
[40:49] another thing
[40:50] that that that that I wrote down. I
[40:53] said, "Why are you puffed up?" And to be
[40:56] puffed up is to be proud. Why are you
[40:59] proud? and said, "Well, God gave me this
[41:01] gift and God gave me that gift." So
[41:04] there therefore, well, he didn't give
[41:06] you that gift. Whatever gift it is, you
[41:09] might look at somebody and say, "They
[41:10] don't have that gift." So you start to
[41:12] get proud of what God gave you. You
[41:15] start to look at somebody else and say,
[41:17] "Well, they don't have that." But I do.
[41:19] See, they didn't see that cuz God didn't
[41:20] show them that cuz it's a gift.
[41:24] But when you do that, God, he pointed
[41:26] out that, "Hey, listen. And you over
[41:28] here saying that I'm better than you.
[41:31] You saying to that person, I'm better
[41:33] than you. What I have is better than
[41:35] what God gave you.
[41:39] But how you going to make it with that
[41:40] attitude? That's right.
[41:42] How are you going to make it with that
[41:44] attitude and saying you know what I
[41:47] because even though sometimes you get
[41:49] trapped into that thinking because
[41:51] people are different
[41:53] and and people are quick to point out
[41:56] your the things that benefit them. So so
[42:00] for example if you are smart people are
[42:02] quick to tell you that you are smart.
[42:04] You take a test you make a 100. Society
[42:07] has shown shows you that when the person
[42:09] make a a hey listen that's a smart
[42:12] student and then therefore the teachers
[42:14] tell you that they're smart and then you
[42:15] inherently but believe it that this
[42:18] person is smart is smart. Now that could
[42:20] be true cuz God give us all different
[42:23] gifts. But just because God didn't give
[42:25] you the straight A or the 100 on
[42:28] everything don't mean that he didn't
[42:30] give you the ability to make straight
[42:31] A's. Just because you don't walk into
[42:34] class and don't study and somebody else
[42:36] can, that doesn't mean you can't get
[42:37] straight A's. All it takes is you to be
[42:40] disciplined and believing and praying
[42:43] and asking God, Lord, give me wisdom and
[42:45] understanding so that I can understand
[42:47] it. I if you work hard enough, you can
[42:49] get A's. Believe me, that that that's
[42:52] something that I've learned in my life.
[42:54] But there are some people that wake up,
[42:56] they get up in the morning, they don't
[42:58] open a
[42:59] book, they don't look at the teacher's
[43:01] notes, and they say, "I'm going to take
[43:04] this test today." And some people, I
[43:07] have seen it in my own life, a person,
[43:09] this guy, he was under the influence. I
[43:12] never forget it. He was under the
[43:14] influence and we was going to take, we
[43:15] was in high school, we were both taking
[43:17] a college class. He went and he I knew
[43:20] before he took the test, he was under
[43:22] the influence. He went in there. He
[43:23] said, "I'm going to take this test
[43:25] today." He went in
[43:27] there. He said, he said, "Man, I just
[43:30] went in there and just started putting
[43:31] answers." I said, "Man, what'd you get
[43:33] on the test?" Cuz I figured, you know, I
[43:36] studied for the test. The test was hard.
[43:38] I knew the test was the test wasn't
[43:40] easy. They had tricky questions and
[43:42] stuff on the test. So, I was like, "Man,
[43:44] what you got on the test?" He said, "Oh,
[43:46] I got a
[43:47] 98." I said, "Huh?"
[43:50] I said, "I I done put in all this work,
[43:53] studying, praying, looking at all this
[43:56] stuff, and he just walked in there under
[43:58] the influence, yeah, I made a 98." I
[44:01] said, "But see, but he was smart. He
[44:04] just didn't have no application to apply
[44:07] himself." And so he he was smart. And I
[44:11] like to say sometimes the person that
[44:13] worked the hardest sometimes get the
[44:14] farthest.
[44:17] It's not all about your natural
[44:20] abilities. Sometimes when you work
[44:22] harder, somebody else that has natural
[44:24] ability is is always can get into the
[44:27] trap of relying on their natural ability
[44:30] of just relying on it. You know what?
[44:33] You know what? I'm smarter than
[44:34] everybody in first grade, second grade,
[44:37] third grade. And it might not catch up
[44:40] until you get out of high school. You
[44:42] get to college and realize, whoa, this a
[44:44] whole another level here. this a whole
[44:47] another level. But but you understand
[44:49] that even though that's when I had to
[44:52] learn different
[44:54] lessons. I I had to learn my lesson too.
[44:58] Everybody meets that thing or something
[45:00] where God will put it in your way to
[45:02] show you that you know what you you just
[45:04] here. You thought you was here but you
[45:07] just here. And God allow you to see it
[45:09] because he don't want you to get that
[45:11] proud spirit.
[45:13] He don't want you to get lifted up and
[45:15] say, "I did this." He has to show you
[45:18] that at some point that you might not
[45:20] have saw it yesterday, but today you
[45:21] realize that Lord, I need something
[45:23] extra than what I got. And the only way
[45:26] I can get it is turn into you. I can try
[45:29] to turn to friends. I can try to turn to
[45:31] family. But sometimes you might get in a
[45:33] place where you can't. They don't even
[45:35] understand it.
[45:37] They don't
[45:38] understand. In my example, from what I
[45:41] went through, when I got to some of my
[45:43] math classes, there was nobody around me
[45:46] that could help me out because what we
[45:50] was learning was so far above what
[45:52] people around me had studied that I I
[45:55] just got there and I was like, you know
[45:56] what? The only way I'm going to make it
[45:58] is by the grace of God. The only way I'm
[46:01] going to make it is by the grace of God.
[46:03] And when you realize that it's not you,
[46:06] it's something greater than you. You
[46:08] start to look at people different. You
[46:10] start to look at situations different.
[46:12] You start to look at what you going
[46:14] through different because you realize
[46:16] that the test was only made because he
[46:18] made a way of escape. He only made the
[46:21] test because he want you to realize,
[46:23] turn to me and I'll bring you right on
[46:26] through. If you turn to me and put your
[46:28] cares on me, I'll provide a way that you
[46:30] didn't even realize was there. Amen.
[46:33] Amen. He might provide someone to come
[46:35] by. And my dad talks about it all the
[46:37] time. There was this guy that I met when
[46:39] I was in school. He was one of the
[46:41] smartest guys I ever met. And my dad
[46:44] marvel that sometimes I call him 1:00 in
[46:46] the
[46:47] morning. And and asked him how to do
[46:50] homework problems. And not one time did
[46:52] he not answer the phone. But he was also
[46:56] I tell people all the time, you can be
[46:58] smart, but there's a there's a different
[47:00] level of intelligence sometimes that God
[47:02] gives people and they possess. But I not
[47:05] only did he had that, he had kindness
[47:08] because that wasn't his testimony with
[47:10] me. I met someone else four years later,
[47:12] never met them in school. They was
[47:14] actually in his degree field and um they
[47:18] told me the same thing about the person.
[47:21] So, it wasn't just he was just acting
[47:23] this way towards me cuz God favored me.
[47:26] That's actually who he was. And see,
[47:28] sometimes you might think that you are
[47:31] great until you meet someone greater.
[47:33] And then you realize, hey, I'm not on
[47:35] the level that I thought I was because
[47:38] you get proud of what you've done and
[47:40] your accomplishment. And sometimes
[47:42] people can push you up and then you
[47:44] start believing what they say. And see,
[47:46] God has a way of allowing you to get to
[47:48] a place to realize, you know what? I'm
[47:50] not as great as I thought I was. Amen.
[47:54] But if you don't realize that that is a
[47:56] test, then you need to turn to God. Then
[47:58] you will continue trying to find other
[48:00] solutions.
[48:01] You'll continue to turn to this thing
[48:03] and you'll turn to that thing. And then
[48:05] sometimes you'll get to the point where
[48:07] you just come to abject failure where
[48:10] you just decide, you know what? I'm
[48:11] going just going to quit this cuz this
[48:13] ain't what I'm supposed to do.
[48:16] cuz you get to the point that you done
[48:18] got so discouraged and so defeated that
[48:21] you never looked up and said, "Lord, I
[48:23] need help." You never turn to the one
[48:26] that could actually give you help. You
[48:27] never turn to the one that can give you
[48:29] understanding. He can give you wisdom.
[48:32] He can give you knowledge. Even when you
[48:34] don't understand, he can make it plain
[48:36] in such a way that it's revealed to you.
[48:39] It becomes a revelation. And then after
[48:41] that, you you ain't got no more trouble.
[48:43] Amen. I remember one time I was in this
[48:46] one class. This class was hard all the
[48:49] way up to the final exam.
[48:51] I literally got to the final exam. I I
[48:54] actually went to the professor one time.
[48:55] I was like, "Am I going to pass this
[49:00] class?" Cuz sometimes it be like that.
[49:02] No matter how smart you get to a point,
[49:04] you be like, "Woo!" Even my super smart
[49:07] friend, he got to some classes, he said,
[49:08] "Man, that class was hard." And so I
[49:10] knew if he said it was hard, that class
[49:13] was almost very it was super hard for
[49:15] everybody else because he was way his
[49:19] level of intelligence was way ahead of
[49:21] us. And so I got to this class and the
[49:24] professor said he said if you make a 100
[49:26] on the final exam, you pass the class.
[49:30] Well, you know, I always shoot for 100
[49:32] on
[49:33] tests, but that's pretty near some some
[49:36] of them classes, it's pretty near close
[49:38] to impossible. But I got to taking the
[49:41] test. I got right before I was studying.
[49:43] I was like I started doing problems and
[49:46] I was like, it can't be that simple. I I
[49:49] did another problem, a practice problem.
[49:51] Now, I was studying. Yeah. Don't forget
[49:54] to study cuz faith without works is
[49:56] dead. So, you got to put something
[49:58] behind it. You got to do something. You
[50:01] can't just pop up every time you take a
[50:03] test. Now, the first time, God might
[50:04] have grace and mercy on you. But the
[50:07] second and third time, the Lord said,
[50:08] "You know what? Soon enough, you got to
[50:10] learn a lesson." So, no, don't don't
[50:13] don't play with the mercy of God and the
[50:16] grace of God. But the first I started
[50:18] knowing these problems and I was like,
[50:20] it wasn't all the way clear, but it was
[50:22] getting clearer and it was getting clear
[50:24] and I was like, "Okay, I got to the
[50:26] final exam. I took the test. The first
[50:30] problem was super hard. I was like,
[50:31] "Well, let me skip this before I forget
[50:33] all this other stuff." I did the second
[50:35] question. I was doing it. I got done.
[50:38] Went to the next question. I did it. Got
[50:41] done. Went to the next question. It was
[50:43] only Now, here's the thing about these
[50:45] tests. There's only about seven problems
[50:47] on the whole
[50:48] test. So, just think about that. You
[50:52] miss one problem or you miss two
[50:54] problems, your grade, you can mess up
[50:56] your whole grade. those those and it's
[50:58] worth about 40% of your grade. So these
[51:01] tests are very critical. So I did the
[51:04] first test, I did the second question,
[51:06] the third question, got to the fourth
[51:08] question and I said, "Hold up. I done
[51:10] finished about three questions and it
[51:11] only been about 20 minutes now. We got
[51:14] three hour three and a half hours to
[51:16] take this
[51:17] test." And I'm looking at everybody else
[51:19] cuz you know you trying to gauge where
[51:21] you are to your to everybody else in the
[51:23] room. I'm like they still on the second
[51:25] question. I'm out on the fourth
[51:27] question. I got done to this one. I got
[51:30] done with the fifth question. The sixth
[51:31] question, the seventh question was extra
[51:33] credit. So, I was like, I'm going to
[51:35] leave that
[51:37] one. All those questions I got done and
[51:40] I had wrote about this much on the whole
[51:42] paper. Now, mind you, the question was a
[51:44] little line across the page. Then there
[51:46] was a blank sheet of paper to show all
[51:47] your work. And I had wrote about this
[51:50] much. I said, I got to erase this and
[51:53] spread it out so it looked like I did
[51:54] more. But I got there and I was and I
[51:57] started doing it and I said, "It can't
[51:59] be this
[52:00] simple. I've been studying this whole
[52:02] year practically not doing well in the
[52:05] class the whole year and got to the
[52:07] final that all made sense." I was like,
[52:10] "It can't be that simple. It can't be
[52:13] that simple." And then I got to the
[52:15] point where some just like, "You know
[52:16] what? It just trust it. It is what it is
[52:20] because you done studied. You done
[52:21] prayed. You done put it in God's hands.
[52:23] Now leave it alone." Amen. And I got
[52:26] there and I I decided that you know
[52:27] what? I'm going to turn this over and
[52:29] whatever I get, it's in God's hands.
[52:32] And I don't know what happened because I
[52:34] can't explain it because some of my
[52:37] friends in that class was doing better
[52:38] than me till it got to the final. And I
[52:41] got my grade back and boy, I was woo
[52:44] hallelujah. It was a wonderful time
[52:46] because I got a higher grade than I
[52:48] expected. Amen. I it was a higher grade
[52:52] than I thought I was going to get in the
[52:53] class. I'm calling all my friends, hey,
[52:55] the grades got posted. What you got?
[52:58] This grade got posted. What you got? And
[53:00] some of my friends that are higher
[53:02] grades than me ended up with lower
[53:04] scores in the class because of that one
[53:06] test.
[53:08] And I looked at it and I said, "If you
[53:10] ever wondered if God loved you,
[53:12] sometimes he just shows you." If you
[53:14] ever was didn't trust that God was real,
[53:17] sometimes he shows you. Sometimes you
[53:20] wonder if God is even hearing your
[53:22] prayers and seeing your tears and
[53:24] listening when you cry out to him and
[53:26] say, "Lord, I need help." And see,
[53:29] sometimes you have to when you get to
[53:31] those type of situations, all your pride
[53:34] go out the window. After that, because
[53:36] see what what I understood, I had to
[53:38] have this class to graduate. This was
[53:41] one of them required classes. Every time
[53:43] when you go to school, they have certain
[53:45] classes even in high school that you got
[53:46] to have before you graduate. for my
[53:49] degree. This was one of those required
[53:50] classes. Now I got to saying, Lord, I
[53:53] don't want to take this class
[53:55] again. See that? That's the difference
[53:57] between high school. Hopefully, you
[53:58] don't fail no classes. But when you get
[54:01] sometimes you have to take a class again
[54:03] if you don't pass it, what you need to
[54:05] get in that class to pass it. But I
[54:07] said, I don't want to take this class
[54:09] again because this class is infinitely
[54:11] hard. Like this class is super hard. I
[54:14] don't want to take it. So when you get
[54:16] to that point, you let all of the things
[54:18] that's blocking you from getting to God
[54:20] out the way and see sometimes God will
[54:23] send things in your life so that you can
[54:25] get to that point to let all those
[54:27] things that's blocking you from getting
[54:29] getting to God out of the way. Whatever
[54:31] it is, whether it's things internal,
[54:33] external, whatever you got to do because
[54:35] you get in situations, say, "Lord, I
[54:38] just need to get in communion with you.
[54:40] Lord, I I I know that this was blocking
[54:43] me and this was blocking me. But all
[54:45] this time, I got to figure out a way to
[54:47] get it out my way. If it's my pride
[54:50] that's in the way, I got to step aside
[54:52] and get out of that and lead that alone
[54:53] by the wayside and say, "Lord, I got to
[54:56] get in communion with you because I need
[54:58] something done for me, Lord. I need you
[55:00] to move in a way that I can't I can't do
[55:03] this. It's greater than me." And and and
[55:07] that's why you got to ask yourself, why
[55:09] am I lifted up? Why why why have I put
[55:13] myself on this pedestal that I am here?
[55:16] Because if you ever look yourself in the
[55:18] mirror, you'll realize how low you are.
[55:21] And if you ain't looked in a long time,
[55:23] please go by and buy you one and look.
[55:25] Because sometimes we we get into this
[55:28] place where we avoid the mirror because
[55:30] we don't want to see what's in it.
[55:33] We don't want to look in the mirror. We
[55:35] don't want to read God's word cuz we
[55:36] don't want to see what's in it. Cuz if I
[55:39] don't read it and it ain't inside of me,
[55:40] ain't nothing to check me to tell me
[55:42] that I'm wrong.
[55:45] If if I don't have the word inside of me
[55:47] and I don't read the word, there's
[55:48] nothing to stop me from saying, you know
[55:50] what, that's wrong. The only thing
[55:52] that's in is that little small voice
[55:54] that say, you know what you did. You
[55:57] know what you did. and that voice. But
[55:59] it's easy sometime to bypass that voice
[56:02] and just run through that stop sign and
[56:04] say it ain't that bad. And then you
[56:05] start reasoning with yourself, you know,
[56:08] well, well, you know, in this
[56:10] circumstance, in this situation, it's
[56:13] really not that bad, but that's not your
[56:16] circumstance or your situation. You con
[56:19] concocted a way to make what you're
[56:21] doing seem right.
[56:24] And God has a way of sometime if you
[56:27] read his word, he he'll let you fall
[56:29] right to the scripture and then you be
[56:30] like,
[56:31] man, as soon as you open your Bible, it
[56:34] don't matter whether you read it 6
[56:36] months ago or the day uh yesterday. As
[56:38] soon as you go to and sometimes it's
[56:40] now, we got we got technology. So soon
[56:42] as you open your app on your phone, it
[56:45] be the verse it be the verse of the day.
[56:48] It's speaking right to you. And you know
[56:50] that sometimes it was God doing that. It
[56:53] was sometime God using it and whatever
[56:56] you want to say, however it was done,
[56:58] sometimes God just allowed you and
[57:00] showed you this is exactly what you need
[57:01] to hear. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[57:05] Because if you don't hear it now,
[57:07] something may come later that that can
[57:09] have a greater effect on you. And see
[57:12] see I started to think about it in
[57:14] Proverbs 11:2. He said, "When pride
[57:16] cometh, then come is shame. But with the
[57:19] lowly is wisdom. And Proverbs 16:5 it
[57:23] says, "Everyone that is proud in heart
[57:26] is an abomination to the
[57:29] Lord." Though hand join in hand, he
[57:32] shall not be
[57:34] unpunished. And Proverbs 29-23, he said,
[57:38] "A man's pride shall bring him low, but
[57:40] honor shall uphold the humble in
[57:42] spirit." Amen. See, God has a way that I
[57:46] if you allow yourself to come down and
[57:48] said, "Lord, whatever you want to do
[57:50] with me, however you want to use me,
[57:53] Lord, whatever you want to do in my
[57:54] life, God has a way of uplifting you
[57:56] greater than you could ever uplift
[57:58] yourself." That's right. And some and
[58:00] some people, we have testimonies to tell
[58:02] you how God has taken us from down here
[58:04] to up here. We can tell you how God has
[58:07] lifted us up when we didn't think it was
[58:08] possible. God made the impossible
[58:11] possible. Amen. said, "I I've seen God
[58:14] do miraculous thing because sometimes
[58:16] God has to show you what he is capable
[58:18] of." And you don't even know what God is
[58:22] capable of because God has a mind that
[58:24] you can't even imagine. He allows us to
[58:26] be limited in our minds. He can do
[58:28] exceedingly abundant. We don't even
[58:30] understand what exceedingly abundantly
[58:32] is. We don't even can fathom what
[58:35] exceedingly abundantly is. But he wrote
[58:37] it there because he wanted you to
[58:38] believe that I got everything in
[58:40] control. And there's nothing that that
[58:43] has acted on you or that has come to you
[58:46] that I didn't have and that I didn't
[58:48] make a way of escape for you so that you
[58:50] can get to a place that you realize that
[58:52] all my help come from the Lord. See,
[58:55] when I when I started thinking about
[58:57] that and I was like, you know what?
[58:59] Sometimes you got to get down on your
[59:00] knees. It was important that when you
[59:02] saw Jesus praying, he was always on his
[59:04] knees because he got to a point of
[59:07] humility. He got down to a space of
[59:09] humility where there was nothing that he
[59:11] realized there's nothing greater than me
[59:13] talking to my father and me being at a
[59:15] place that Lord, I want to make sure
[59:17] that Lord, when I commute with you, I
[59:19] got everything right. Lord, I want to
[59:22] make sure there's nothing between you
[59:23] and me.
[59:25] So, it's great to pray with people, but
[59:27] sometimes you got to pray by yourself.
[59:29] Amen. I don't care how close you are and
[59:31] you got a prayer partner and a prayer
[59:32] warrior. Sometimes you got to pray for
[59:35] yourself because you got to have that
[59:37] personal relationship, that personal
[59:39] experience, that personal interaction
[59:41] with God where you know when your prayer
[59:44] when you can't get through to your
[59:45] prayer partner, you still got God on the
[59:48] main line and you can tell him exactly
[59:50] what you want. See, cuz God even knows
[59:53] when you come to him, he knows what you
[59:54] need. Amen. He knows what you need and
[59:57] he's always listening. That's the
[1:00:00] difference between God and people. God
[1:00:01] is always listening. Whether you think
[1:00:04] he is or not. Because when you pray
[1:00:06] something, sometimes he don't move when
[1:00:08] you want him to move. That don't mean
[1:00:09] God ain't listening. That don't mean God
[1:00:12] ain't hear your prayer. That don't mean
[1:00:14] that God ain't sending your answer right
[1:00:16] on the way. But it's on the way. And if
[1:00:18] you start to doubt, he allowed to pause.
[1:00:22] When you start to doubt and you you you
[1:00:24] stop your own
[1:00:26] blessings because you doubt it.
[1:00:30] Sometimes God allowed to come through
[1:00:32] but because he's gracious and merc
[1:00:34] merciful. But when you doubt, you can
[1:00:36] hinder what God has for you. You ask him
[1:00:39] for something and God got it on the way
[1:00:41] and then you say, "God, you taking too
[1:00:43] long. I'm just going to do my own
[1:00:46] thing." Because you you start to think
[1:00:49] that God didn't hear what you asked him.
[1:00:52] God didn't hear what you had to say. God
[1:00:54] didn't listen to me. I wonder what's
[1:00:56] going on. Is he the same God of
[1:00:58] yesterday, today, and for? And then you
[1:01:00] start to plant that seed of
[1:01:02] doubt. And and that seed of doubt, when
[1:01:05] you continue to go on that path, it
[1:01:07] starts to grow. Next thing you know, you
[1:01:09] got a whole complex between you and God
[1:01:11] from one little small thing. And you got
[1:01:14] to go to a point to say, "Lord, I still
[1:01:17] believe in." You got to come back to the
[1:01:19] realization that Lord, you still good.
[1:01:21] And Lord, you're still God. And Lord, I
[1:01:23] didn't forget and what I asked you for.
[1:01:25] And Lord, I still believe that you going
[1:01:27] to do what what I asked you to.
[1:01:30] See, you got to you got to supplant that
[1:01:32] doubt with faith. And that's the only
[1:01:35] way to remove doubt. You got to come up
[1:01:37] and have faith. The prophet of God told
[1:01:38] a story the story about the Indian
[1:01:41] chief. And there was two dogs that was
[1:01:43] sitting there. And the Indian chief, I
[1:01:45] asked him which one. He asked the Indian
[1:01:47] chief, I might forgive me if I if I if I
[1:01:50] get the story wrong, but the question
[1:01:52] was asked like which dog would win the
[1:01:55] fight and the answer from the story came
[1:01:58] that whichever one you feed the most.
[1:02:00] Said there was a white dog and a black
[1:02:02] dog and he asked which one would win the
[1:02:04] fight and it was whichever one you feed
[1:02:06] the most. So the more that you feed in
[1:02:08] the doubt the worse it'll get. Amen.
[1:02:10] Amen. And the more that you feed in the
[1:02:12] faith, the better it'll get. You might
[1:02:14] not even understand. See, but when you
[1:02:16] feed in the faith, sometimes it seem
[1:02:18] like it's getting worse. It seems like
[1:02:21] it's getting darker, but you know that
[1:02:24] right before day, it's the darkest part
[1:02:27] of the night. Right before the sunshine,
[1:02:30] there's light. Sometimes it gets the
[1:02:32] darkest part of the night
[1:02:34] because right then they know, it knows
[1:02:37] that here comes light. The light is
[1:02:40] coming. But but sometimes you get right
[1:02:42] up to the last right before the last
[1:02:45] moment. Get right up to the door and
[1:02:48] then you say, "You know what?" Now, what
[1:02:50] you didn't realize that the door was
[1:02:52] unlocked, but because the Lord already
[1:02:54] done unlocked the door, but you get
[1:02:56] right up to the door and you say, "You
[1:02:58] know what? I'm not going through this
[1:03:00] door. I'm going to go break down this
[1:03:02] door that's got all these warning sign.
[1:03:04] Please don't open me. Please don't come
[1:03:06] near me." But that's the door you turn
[1:03:08] to because you you feel like God ain't
[1:03:11] heard what you asked
[1:03:13] him. You turn to that door even though
[1:03:15] there's all and as you trying to break
[1:03:17] through that door, everything that can't
[1:03:19] stop you is trying to stop
[1:03:21] you. You getting warning signs from over
[1:03:24] here, flashing lights from over there,
[1:03:26] people and strangers coming up to you
[1:03:28] and and talking to you and say,
[1:03:29] "Beware." And then you still trying to
[1:03:32] break down the door because you say, "I
[1:03:35] can do it. I can do it. See, I was told
[1:03:38] I can do it. You know, and then you
[1:03:40] start believing in yourself. And we have
[1:03:43] a society that tells us you should
[1:03:45] believe in yourself. You can do whatever
[1:03:47] you set your mind to.
[1:03:49] You can you can accomplish whatever you
[1:03:51] set your mind to. But I tell you, if God
[1:03:54] don't have that for you,
[1:03:57] there's nothing you can do about it. No
[1:03:59] matter how hard you set your mind
[1:04:01] towards it and say, "I'm going to
[1:04:02] accomplish this." If God hasn't purposed
[1:04:04] for for your life that it will always be
[1:04:08] a struggle and a hard thing for you to
[1:04:10] do. But if God has it for you, it'll be
[1:04:12] a easy way. It might be some roadblocks
[1:04:15] in the way, but when you come through
[1:04:17] them, you realize the path was always
[1:04:18] easy. When you get get towards it and
[1:04:21] get towards the finish line, you realize
[1:04:23] that path was so easier than the path
[1:04:26] that I was going to take up.
[1:04:28] See, it might have been straight and it
[1:04:30] might have been narrow. But when I look
[1:04:31] back at that winding path, even though
[1:04:34] it was broad, it was winding all the way
[1:04:36] and it was going on a downward spiral.
[1:04:40] This little narrow path and this little
[1:04:41] straight little path that that that's
[1:04:43] pointed this way, it's straight uphill.
[1:04:46] It's straight uphill. And it's and it
[1:04:48] might seem like a hard climb cuz you're
[1:04:50] climbing up and and when you're climbing
[1:04:54] up, sometimes you get winded when you're
[1:04:56] out of shape.
[1:04:58] Amen. Amen. Amen. and you get winded
[1:05:00] when you're out of shape, that doesn't
[1:05:02] mean that that that's not the climb for
[1:05:04] you. See, you got to continue to decide
[1:05:07] this is the climb for me and this is the
[1:05:09] way I want to go. This is the climb for
[1:05:12] me and this is the way I want to go. And
[1:05:14] when you climbing this path, there's a
[1:05:16] place that you can lay down all your
[1:05:18] burdens. There's a place that you can go
[1:05:20] to and say, "Here, take all my cares and
[1:05:23] see here take all my problems." When
[1:05:26] when you when you're on this path,
[1:05:28] everything that's trying to stop you,
[1:05:30] it's just a speed bump. It's not a real
[1:05:33] thing to stop you. It's just a speed
[1:05:35] bump. It's it's not and and it's a
[1:05:38] little puddle right here that you just
[1:05:39] got to hop on over. You just got to
[1:05:42] cross on through. You think it's 6 ft
[1:05:43] deep. It's only 2 in. But you see this
[1:05:47] big puddle across the road and you can't
[1:05:49] see the bottom. So you think that it's 6
[1:05:51] ft deep and it's only 2 in. Cuz under
[1:05:54] God got a way that's that's holding you
[1:05:55] up as you walk straight across it. See,
[1:05:58] but that's where that's where God allow
[1:06:00] you to see that you know what? This way
[1:06:02] that I got prepared for you is a whole
[1:06:04] lot easier than a big winding broad path
[1:06:08] that's going straight down. Even though
[1:06:11] it might not seem that it's going
[1:06:12] straight down, it's going straight down.
[1:06:15] It it but it because it's winding and
[1:06:17] weaving its way. You you can't see. you
[1:06:20] turn this way and you make this mistake
[1:06:22] and you turn this way and you make that
[1:06:24] mistake and you go down a little bit
[1:06:25] further and you turn this way and each
[1:06:27] way each time that you that you go
[1:06:29] further you you getting lower and lower
[1:06:32] and God has a way that he want to tell
[1:06:33] you you know what you don't have to make
[1:06:35] those choices no more even though this
[1:06:38] way it might seem like you're going
[1:06:39] straight up and straight up here and
[1:06:42] some everything that's in this path I
[1:06:44] already got it every way that you may go
[1:06:47] I already got it so don't get proud out
[1:06:49] and lift yourself up on this journey.
[1:06:52] Don't don't think that you better than
[1:06:53] somebody else on this journey because
[1:06:56] everything that I got for you is on the
[1:06:58] way. And if you continue to go on this
[1:07:00] path, you'll realize that this path was
[1:07:02] much better than the path that was over
[1:07:04] there.
[1:07:05] I said, I never seen God fail. And I
[1:07:08] never seen God do anybody wrong. Amen.
[1:07:11] Amen. People can do you wrong. Amen.
[1:07:13] Things can do you wrong and people
[1:07:16] behind the things can do you wrong, but
[1:07:18] God ain't never done you wrong. And God
[1:07:21] will never do you wrong. All you got to
[1:07:23] do is turn to him and say, "Lord, this
[1:07:25] is I want this for my life." And and God
[1:07:28] will come and he'll and he'll take over
[1:07:30] your entire life. And God don't leave.
[1:07:33] But you got to give them all your life.
[1:07:36] Sometimes you don't you wonder why
[1:07:38] things ain't happening. It's cuz you
[1:07:39] only gave God part, not the whole. Amen.
[1:07:42] You only gave God a part. This part I'm
[1:07:45] good with you on Tuesday, Friday and
[1:07:47] Sunday. Uh Sunday and Wednesday. I don't
[1:07:51] want you on the rest of the days, Lord.
[1:07:53] But see, God has a God want to complete.
[1:07:56] He want everything. When he come to you
[1:07:58] and ask you and he knock on your door,
[1:08:01] he wants everything. He wants you to
[1:08:03] give it up all and say, "Lord, I want to
[1:08:05] give you all." Amen. whatever that is
[1:08:08] and however it comes, he wants you to
[1:08:10] get he wants you to give him everything.
[1:08:14] And he's only asking you what he gave.
[1:08:16] Amen. He not asking you something that
[1:08:19] he didn't do himself. He not asking you
[1:08:21] something that's grandeur and out of
[1:08:23] this place that he didn't decide to come
[1:08:25] down to earth and do and go through
[1:08:27] himself and even worse than what you may
[1:08:30] go through. He he he did it because he
[1:08:33] loved you. He did it because he cared
[1:08:36] and he said, "I want to make a way of
[1:08:37] escape for you." Because if he didn't
[1:08:40] come, we'd all be lost. We'd all be
[1:08:43] lost. It wouldn't be it wouldn't be
[1:08:44] written that it'd come to the end time
[1:08:47] and scarcely he had to speed up the time
[1:08:49] because scarcely anybody would be saved.
[1:08:53] No, he did it in such a way if he did it
[1:08:56] those long time ago, I I started
[1:08:58] thinking about it. I said, "You know
[1:08:59] what? You can look at this one or this
[1:09:01] one. But I look at it and say, "Lord,
[1:09:03] you did it just for me." I You might be
[1:09:06] worried about this walk, this person
[1:09:08] walk, and that person walk, but
[1:09:09] sometimes you got to sit down and real
[1:09:11] and focus on yourself and say, "Lord,
[1:09:13] you did this just for me. Lord, you came
[1:09:15] down and you did this just for me." And
[1:09:18] you got to make it personal to yourself.
[1:09:20] You got to start enjoying that thing and
[1:09:22] said, "Lord, and thanking God for doing
[1:09:24] what he just did for you." Amen. And
[1:09:27] when you stop thinking about everybody
[1:09:28] else, you start thinking about how good
[1:09:30] God is to you and the small things that
[1:09:32] God does every single day.
[1:09:35] And just waking you up every morning in
[1:09:38] a place that you can call a home is a
[1:09:40] great thing. But we don't count those as
[1:09:42] blessings because they normal to us. God
[1:09:45] has blessed us to a point that it's just
[1:09:47] normal to us.
[1:09:49] But if you ever go see somebody that
[1:09:52] ain't as blessed as you. Cuz that's all
[1:09:54] it is is the blessings and mercy of and
[1:09:56] grace of God. That's the only reason
[1:09:58] that that you have a home, you have a
[1:10:00] car, and somebody else is on the street
[1:10:02] is just because God was gracious and
[1:10:04] merciful and decided to bless you with
[1:10:06] those things. And in one moment, just
[1:10:09] like Job, you can have nothing. Amen.
[1:10:11] Amen. Like some people in this day and
[1:10:13] age where all their money is tied up in
[1:10:15] in a market that's going up and down.
[1:10:18] Some that's why they said after the
[1:10:20] great depression, one of the great one
[1:10:22] of the things that happened was a was an
[1:10:24] increase in suicide
[1:10:25] rate because people had all this hope in
[1:10:30] this system. They had all this hope in
[1:10:33] this thing and when it crashed that was
[1:10:35] the end of their hope. That was the end
[1:10:38] of their faith. that was in their belief
[1:10:40] that there was a reason to exist in
[1:10:42] life. But when you get God, there's a
[1:10:45] greater reason to live. Now, when you
[1:10:48] get the Lord in your heart and in your
[1:10:50] soul, there's a greater reason to live.
[1:10:52] There's a reason to wake up every
[1:10:54] morning and you realize that you only
[1:10:56] waking up because he gave you life,
[1:10:57] health, and strength to wake up.
[1:11:01] See, you have a reason to live.
[1:11:04] If you struggle with that fight and that
[1:11:06] battle, there's someone that can give
[1:11:07] you a reason to wake up every morning
[1:11:10] and to get up and say, "Thank you,
[1:11:11] Lord." Because it's a greater testimony
[1:11:14] when God brings you through something
[1:11:15] like that. There's a reason that you can
[1:11:17] shout all over the place and thank God
[1:11:20] and someone wonder why you got a praise
[1:11:22] on your heart is because God has done
[1:11:24] something from me. He saved me from my
[1:11:26] own self. Amen. He saved me from doing
[1:11:29] something that I I would have regretted
[1:11:31] for the and I wouldn't even been here.
[1:11:33] But God has a way of keeping you because
[1:11:35] he got a reason for you to be here.
[1:11:37] Amen. That's the reason why I read the
[1:11:39] scripture because every part of the body
[1:11:41] has a place to play. Amen. So which
[1:11:44] means that you are important. Which
[1:11:46] means that when you are missing you are
[1:11:49] the part of the body is missing. Amen.
[1:11:51] When you are not there, part of the body
[1:11:53] is missing. When we come together, we
[1:11:55] come together as a whole, as one body.
[1:11:58] And when you are missing, your part is
[1:11:59] missing from the body. Amen. Amen. And
[1:12:02] God just want to sometimes show you that
[1:12:04] what your role is important. How
[1:12:06] whatever however you view your role,
[1:12:10] doesn't mean it's any less important to
[1:12:12] God.
[1:12:13] No matter how you view your role, cuz
[1:12:16] sometimes you can get to the place of
[1:12:19] despair because the devil will come and
[1:12:21] say, "You know what? They don't need
[1:12:23] you.
[1:12:24] um your services are not needed.
[1:12:28] I've been in those situations and boy
[1:12:30] you you can get into a low and a dark
[1:12:33] place once if someone comes to you and
[1:12:36] say you know what we thank you for your
[1:12:37] time but we don't need you no
[1:12:40] more in and in in a manner of speaking
[1:12:44] and then you have to come to a place
[1:12:46] that you know what whatever the next
[1:12:47] part of my journey is Lord I trust that
[1:12:50] it's it's the right way because you
[1:12:52] because when you you can't lean to this
[1:12:54] one and lean to that one because
[1:12:56] everybody got a different story, but
[1:12:57] it's not your story. Amen. Everybody,
[1:13:00] they can give you testimony after
[1:13:01] testimony, but you ain't you live you
[1:13:04] you going through the struggle right
[1:13:05] now. So, yeah, it's it's kind of
[1:13:07] beneficial, but it ain't your
[1:13:10] struggle. So, you just listening to the
[1:13:12] testimony like that's
[1:13:14] Mhm. Mhm. Thank you, Lord. Mhm. But it's
[1:13:18] hard because you going through that
[1:13:20] struggle in that moment. And sometimes
[1:13:23] you got to go and say Lord I got I need
[1:13:25] something as I need the re this the real
[1:13:29] assurance within myself that Lord that
[1:13:32] as I gave myself to you and Lord I
[1:13:35] dedicated my life Lord you going to see
[1:13:37] me right on through this. Not only are
[1:13:39] you going to see me through this you
[1:13:40] going to make it better than I ever
[1:13:41] expected. See I'm a living testimony of
[1:13:44] things that have happened in my life
[1:13:46] that I experienced and I witness and I
[1:13:48] can say God has done greater than I
[1:13:50] thought. Amen.
[1:13:52] with one child left and you come and and
[1:13:54] you come back a couple years later and
[1:13:56] God done blessed you with
[1:14:02] over so many thousands of dollars
[1:14:05] raised. Yeah. And it was more than 15.
[1:14:08] Amen. God God is good. So So you see
[1:14:10] when God does something, it wasn't what
[1:14:12] you thought. And just the thing that
[1:14:15] happened to you, you it was a battle,
[1:14:17] but it was just a redirection.
[1:14:19] where God was redirecting you to a
[1:14:21] different path that you never would have
[1:14:23] experienced if that battle didn't
[1:14:25] happen. That's right. You would not have
[1:14:27] gone through that journey if that battle
[1:14:29] did not happen. And sometimes it ain't
[1:14:31] until you come through the battle that
[1:14:33] you realize, "Thank you, Jesus." You
[1:14:35] said, "Thank you, Lord, cuz I never
[1:14:37] would have been on this path that I'm on
[1:14:39] if you hadn't sent this struggle my way.
[1:14:42] you hadn't sent this battle my way, I
[1:14:44] never would have seen these blessings.
[1:14:46] Cuz I would have continued to go on the
[1:14:48] way that I thought it was the right way
[1:14:50] for me. But when I stopped thinking
[1:14:52] about that, I started thanking the Lord.
[1:14:54] I said, "Thank you, Lord, for this
[1:14:55] battle. Lord, thank you for this
[1:14:56] happening. Lord, thank you for this
[1:14:58] occurrence happening. Lord, thank you
[1:15:00] for allowing me to go through this and
[1:15:01] go through that cuz Lord, I I'm not
[1:15:04] prideful no more. Lord, I I can I can be
[1:15:07] lower. I can be high. It don't matter to
[1:15:08] me cuz God has cuz even through all of
[1:15:11] that, God has seen me right on through.
[1:15:13] Just like David said, "Yay, though I
[1:15:15] walk through the valley of the shadow up
[1:15:17] there, say I will fear no evil." See,
[1:15:20] God has a way of making all the things
[1:15:22] work out. So that you can go back and it
[1:15:25] be a testimony of how good God is and
[1:15:28] tell somebody that you know the path
[1:15:30] that you thought that you was going to
[1:15:32] go on may not be the path that God got
[1:15:34] for you. So you got to trust the creator
[1:15:36] that created the path. Cuz if you don't
[1:15:38] trust him, you'll never go down that
[1:15:40] path cuz you'll think this is the way
[1:15:42] I'm supposed to go. God, you blessed me
[1:15:44] with this. Lord, you gave me this. And
[1:15:46] it's just like Job. Lord, you gave me
[1:15:48] this. And just like his wife said, why
[1:15:50] did you take it away?
[1:15:54] Because God had greater for him. Amen.
[1:15:56] So if you always looking at this this
[1:15:58] thing right here, you'll never get into
[1:16:01] the mindset and say, "Lord, what you got
[1:16:03] for me is greater than what I had. Lord,
[1:16:05] whatever you coming forth with is
[1:16:08] greater than what I had. And and the and
[1:16:10] the greater the battle, the greater the
[1:16:11] victory. The greater the battle, the
[1:16:13] greater the victory. And when you start
[1:16:15] thanking God for the battle, it changes
[1:16:17] your outlook on the battle. You can
[1:16:19] march in the war with a happy and a
[1:16:21] smile on your face. Because you realize
[1:16:24] that this battle is not mine. It's his.
[1:16:27] Say, "I'm not prideful no more. I ain't
[1:16:29] got to think about my own ability cuz I
[1:16:31] know who's fighting this battle is
[1:16:33] greater than me. who's who's going
[1:16:35] through this war is greater than me. And
[1:16:38] so I ain't got to lean on my strength no
[1:16:40] more. I got someone giving me strength.
[1:16:42] It's giving me a reason to be happy when
[1:16:44] I come to this battle. When I come to
[1:16:46] this fight, when I look at this person
[1:16:48] that I know is talking about me, I can
[1:16:50] have peace.
[1:16:52] I can have a wonderful attitude with
[1:16:54] them. I can even work with them now.
[1:16:56] Lord Jesus, ain't that something right
[1:16:59] there? Lord have mercy. Because it is
[1:17:01] different when you know that people done
[1:17:02] done you wrong. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:17:05] And God has a way sometime of putting
[1:17:07] you
[1:17:08] together just sometimes to test to see
[1:17:12] if you really you really trust them.
[1:17:15] Lord have mercy. Cuz that that that's a
[1:17:17] true thing. But you got to get past the
[1:17:19] point you say, you know what, that
[1:17:21] battle might they might not even known
[1:17:24] that. I wrote something down. I said,
[1:17:26] how did you know that God didn't do that
[1:17:29] just for you? Amen. Amen. God ain't
[1:17:31] purposed that test just for you. That
[1:17:34] might not be who they who they even are.
[1:17:36] I wrote down there's a story in the
[1:17:38] Bible where the de where the devils came
[1:17:40] down and they and they and and they was
[1:17:42] asking the Lord. They they was talking
[1:17:44] to God and they said, "Oo, which spirit,
[1:17:46] Lord, you want to send down there?" And
[1:17:49] and he was this spirit and that spirit.
[1:17:51] And then it was the lion spirit. The
[1:17:52] Lord said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the
[1:17:53] one. Go on down there."
[1:17:56] See, God sometimes he they have a the
[1:17:59] Lord will have a conference and say,
[1:18:01] "Which one do you want to go test your
[1:18:03] child?" That's right.
[1:18:06] Everything going good, wonderful. You
[1:18:09] ready and excited and here come the car
[1:18:12] tire is flag right when you about to go
[1:18:15] to church.
[1:18:17] this one acting up and this one and you
[1:18:19] having a wonderful day and somebody said
[1:18:21] this thing that triggers a a moment that
[1:18:24] you done been through and it done send
[1:18:26] you down a whole
[1:18:28] spiral and you be like Lord why I got to
[1:18:31] go through this and then you got to come
[1:18:34] to a place you say
[1:18:35] Lord I'm not going to let this deter me
[1:18:38] from what you got for me Lord I'm not
[1:18:41] going I'm not going this is just a speed
[1:18:43] bump in this journey of victory this is
[1:18:46] not something that's going to make me
[1:18:47] tumble and fall like it might have used
[1:18:49] to cuz you gave me victory over this.
[1:18:52] You done I you done overcome this and we
[1:18:55] done defeated this. This just a this
[1:18:57] just a speed bump on the journey and
[1:18:59] when I see the speed bump I'm going over
[1:19:01] this one and each time you go over you
[1:19:03] push a speed bump down. You push it down
[1:19:05] and soon enough it's a flat road. You
[1:19:08] you drive something heavy enough over a
[1:19:10] speed bump soon enough eventually it'll
[1:19:12] go down if it's not replaced. That's why
[1:19:14] they have to replace him every now and
[1:19:16] again because something has to happen.
[1:19:19] It has to it has to be has to recede.
[1:19:22] But you see, God want us to get to a
[1:19:24] place that we can turn to him and said,
[1:19:26] "Lord, no matter what I'm going through,
[1:19:28] Lord, I'm not going to look at who I am.
[1:19:31] I'm not going to look at what these
[1:19:33] things that I may have, Lord, I'm going
[1:19:35] to turn to you.
[1:19:37] I'm going to turn to you. And Lord, I'm
[1:19:38] not going to be lifted up. I'm not going
[1:19:40] to think I'm some great or I'm this or
[1:19:42] I'm that or that. I don't need nobody
[1:19:45] help cuz that can hinder you and stop
[1:19:47] you from getting victory too. Well, you
[1:19:50] say I don't need nobody. I can do it
[1:19:52] myself. See, God allows us to be
[1:19:54] together. He's tried to show you in the
[1:19:56] scripture that you you going to need
[1:19:57] somebody because the body, the eye is no
[1:20:00] good without the body. Amen. What is the
[1:20:02] heart without a body in it to pump blood
[1:20:04] to? Amen. And say I'm the heartbeat of
[1:20:07] my friend group. Well, sometime God got
[1:20:09] to give you different friends. Amen.
[1:20:11] That's right. He he got to remove you
[1:20:13] cuz the the rest friends that's around
[1:20:15] you those body parts ain't they ain't
[1:20:17] coalesing together right here. You got
[1:20:19] two leg you got three
[1:20:21] legs and one arm and God had to remove
[1:20:25] some people so you can have two arms in
[1:20:26] your friend group and two legs. See God
[1:20:29] has a way of making sure that he
[1:20:31] disperse things in such a perfect
[1:20:33] manner. And when he get done with it,
[1:20:36] it's better than anything you could have
[1:20:37] ever thought. And sometimes the enemy
[1:20:40] you thought was your enemy was actually
[1:20:41] the one God wanted you to spread the
[1:20:43] light to. And they become a greater
[1:20:46] friend to you than you ever would have
[1:20:47] thought cuz you thought they was your
[1:20:49] enemy. Just know that sometimes their
[1:20:51] eyes was covered and the veil was over
[1:20:53] them. And when they got lifted, they
[1:20:55] understood that it was just a thing that
[1:20:57] they was going through. It was just
[1:20:59] something that they was going through.
[1:21:00] And when God brought them through, they
[1:21:02] realized they become greater to you than
[1:21:05] you ever could imagine. when they
[1:21:07] understand what was going on or God just
[1:21:09] changed their heart, they realize, you
[1:21:11] know what, that was just I don't know
[1:21:13] what was going on. Amen. Amen. It was
[1:21:15] just a momentary lapse. It was just a
[1:21:18] momentary thing that that just lapsed in
[1:21:20] me, but God has brought me through it or
[1:21:22] or or I see that you're not the person
[1:21:25] that I thought you was. I see that God
[1:21:27] has done a wonder cuz I remember when
[1:21:29] and then they got this whole thing to
[1:21:31] tell you about how you was. But God has
[1:21:34] a way of showing you that that over time
[1:21:36] if you come and cast your cares on him,
[1:21:39] he'll change you into who he want you to
[1:21:41] be. He'll change you into who he want
[1:21:43] you to be. And when and when you get
[1:21:44] there, you realize a wonderful change
[1:21:46] has come over me. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:22:02] song say if I'm too
[1:22:06] high I don't know how this song if I'm
[1:22:08] too high

[1:22:18] time ago if we're too
[1:22:21] high

[1:22:27] the Lord." He says,
[1:22:30] "Always,
[1:22:32] Lord, help me to humble myself." Amen.
[1:22:36] Don't ask him to humble you
[1:22:38] down. God
[1:22:41] can take the high and make it low. Yes,
[1:22:45] sir. And God can take the low and
[1:22:48] lift and make it high. Amen. Amen. And
[1:22:52] everything that's up
[1:22:55] here in this world
[1:22:57] here, everything that is deemed to be
[1:23:00] great in this
[1:23:01] world in God's sight
[1:23:05] is it's the low things. Those things
[1:23:08] that are
[1:23:09] despised, those things that are
[1:23:13] rejected, those are the things that God
[1:23:18] exalts, despised and
[1:23:22] rejected. You're in this world, but
[1:23:24] you're not of this world. Amen.
[1:23:27] You you're here for
[1:23:30] season preparing to go to
[1:23:35] your some say your final
[1:23:38] destination. The place that God had
[1:23:41] prepared for you before the foundation
[1:23:44] of the
[1:23:45] world. God want to take you to that
[1:23:49] place, the place called
[1:23:52] heaven. Amen.
[1:23:56] And God wants to take you to that place,
[1:23:59] but you have to be humble enough to let
[1:24:02] him do it.
[1:24:03] Because you can't get
[1:24:08] there with the proud spirit. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:12] We must be humble.
[1:24:15] And that humbleness said, "Lord, we need
[1:24:17] you." Amen.
[1:24:19] I'm in need of you, Lord. I need you
[1:24:21] now. I need your spirit. I need your
[1:24:24] power. I need God.
[1:24:27] I'm I'm helpless without you, Lord. For
[1:24:31] he said, "Without me, you can do
[1:24:32] nothing." Nothing.
[1:24:37] Amen. God bless you tonight. Do you
[1:24:39] appreciate your word? Let us
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:43] stand. Hallelujah. Let's just
[1:24:48] bow. Hallelujah.
[1:24:52] If I'm too
[1:24:53] high, the Lord, I want to come
[1:25:02] down.
[1:25:05] Lord, if the word is spoke to your heart
[1:25:10] tonight, Lord
[1:25:13] Jesus, if you spoke to someone
[1:25:17] tonight in a simple way,
[1:25:21] Lord, just one
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:26] body, Lord, we
[1:25:29] cannot we're connected by your spirit.
[1:25:35] [Music]
[1:25:40] So, Father, help us to
[1:25:47] recognize we're not alone, but we're
[1:25:53] one. We're one in Christ Jesus.
[1:25:58] So, Father, help us, oh
[1:26:00] God, to know even now that you're not
[1:26:09] alone. How many
[1:26:11] tonight we would examine
[1:26:15] ourselves? Sometimes we feel like we're
[1:26:18] on our
[1:26:19] own, but he's saying to you tonight,
[1:26:22] you're not on your own.
[1:26:26] You're a part of the body of
[1:26:30] Christ. And because you're a part of his
[1:26:34] body, hallelujah.
[1:26:37] Then let the head lead the body.
[1:26:44] Praise God.
[1:26:54] him. If you examine yourself
[1:26:59] tonight, why don't you let Jesus come
[1:27:01] into your life if you're not saved
[1:27:04] tonight? If you don't know him as your
[1:27:07] Lord and
[1:27:09] Savior, accept that straight and narrow
[1:27:12] way. The Broadway leading to
[1:27:15] destruction.
[1:27:17] Are you willing to accept that straight
[1:27:18] and narrow way and say, "Lord, I'll
[1:27:20] follow
[1:27:25] you." As I head to my heart to look into
[1:27:27] him, is there someone said, "Lord, I
[1:27:29] follow you the straight and narrow way."
[1:27:31] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:27:35] you. Thank you. I want to go that
[1:27:37] straight and narrow
[1:27:39] way. Father, you see the hands that are
[1:27:41] lifted, the hearts that are open up this
[1:27:44] tonight, Lord.
[1:27:47] Lord, we want to walk humbly before you,
[1:27:50] Lord. Not the crowded way, not the broad
[1:27:52] way, but the straight and narrow
[1:27:56] way. Lord, we humble ourselves in your
[1:27:59] presence
[1:28:00] tonight. We humble ourselves in your
[1:28:03] presence
[1:28:05] tonight. Lord, accept these that have
[1:28:07] lifted their hands and open up their
[1:28:09] hearts.
[1:28:12] All you got to do is say, "Lord Jesus,
[1:28:13] we welcome you into our
[1:28:15] lives. We want to be meek and lonely. We
[1:28:18] want to be like you, Jesus. Forgive us
[1:28:21] of our sins and come into our hearts,
[1:28:24] Lord. Fill us with your love and your
[1:28:27] power, Lord. We need it
[1:28:30] now, Lord. We trust you right now to do
[1:28:33] something to
[1:28:36] change, oh God, to strengthen their
[1:28:39] faith, Lord. To strengthen them, Lord,
[1:28:42] to settle them that they be no more
[1:28:44] tossed to and fro with
[1:28:47] doubt. But know that they they've been
[1:28:50] chosen by you. They're child of
[1:28:52] God. Thank you, Lord, for these hearts,
[1:28:56] their lives. Let's give God praise
[1:28:58] tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:29:02] Hallelujah. Thank you
[1:29:04] Jesus. Thank you
[1:29:06] Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Lord we love
[1:29:10] you. Lord we appreciate you. Lord we
[1:29:14] thank
[1:29:15] you.
[1:29:17] Hallelujah. Yes
[1:29:19] Lord. It's all right to praise
[1:29:22] God for he's
[1:29:25] good. We're helpers one of another.
[1:29:29] We're
[1:29:30] one. Bear ye one another
[1:29:35] burdens. If you haven't been baptized in

[1:29:49] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:29:50] the gift of the Holy Ghost. It's your
