[41:29] me
[41:31] you know and uh
[41:33] just to encourage you this morning
[41:36] because we all seem to be in this hour
[41:40] amen that we're going through different
[41:43] tests and different trials and
[41:45] tribulation
[41:47] but he says here after you've suffered a
[41:50] while
[41:52] after you've suffered a while
[41:56] praise God
[41:58] Hallelujah I believe it's very
[42:01] relevant to us today
[42:04] amen that
[42:06] we can identify with
[42:09] suffering
[42:12] I mean from every aspect I mean

[42:38] you know I I was thanking the lord for
[42:41] that fourth verse he said when the chief
[42:43] Shepherd shall appear you shall receive
[42:46] a Crown of Glory that faded not away
[42:50] uh I got all excited I guess I got to
[42:54] wanting to Run and Jump into everything
[42:57] because
[42:58] you know
[43:00] I wasn't looking at my suffering
[43:03] you know my mind wasn't on what I was

[43:12] away
[43:13] amen see that's the Christian amen
[43:17] perspective of things they're looking at
[43:19] the Crown of Glory
[43:21] you know I I believe amen no matter how
[43:25] hard the taskmasters was over in Egypt I
[43:28] believe that the children of Israel had
[43:31] a promise from God and that promise was
[43:34] echoed for hundreds of years
[43:37] amen but it
[43:39] kept on echoing amen but it was one time
[43:44] that the promise of uh of God was drawn

[1:21:13] if you want victory
[1:21:15] people don't realize the power of prayer

[1:21:20] people don't realize where you get the
[1:21:22] strength from

[1:21:25] They Don't Really guide and cry to God
[1:21:28] like they should

[1:21:32] God wants you to get recharged
