Father Lord we come before you tonight Lord as humble as we know how Lord oh God to stand before your children Lord as called by Your Name Lord we thank you Lord for blessing us all to be here tonight God and be able God to be called by your name oh Lord I pray God for all the hands that's lifted today Lord and the hearts that's raised God I pray God that you might bless your people Lord and oh God that you might go by and see about the needs of your children Lord there's so many sick and Afflicted today so many God asking for prayer but God you know them all by name and oh God the time would fail Lord if we try to remember them all but Lord I pray God that you would go by each and every home and oh God see a about the well-being of your children God I pray your spirit might go out God and Bless the people Lord I pray tonight Lord as we God look into the word God that you might give us Grace Lord to be able to speak Lord what's on our hearts God oh Lord that you might bless us in a

your presence no matter where we might find ourselves in this life life God we want to be in your will and Lord we just thank you for that tonight God we pray you bless your people bless the word Lord as we look to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God is good amen we want to still talk about gross Darkness tonight over in Isaiah 60 amen Isaiah 60 it's been on our hearts and you know we can't get away from it amen you know looking at the anointed ones in the end time I was you just thanking God cuz you can see the need for that amen you can really see the need for it looks like the world itself has turned to a a a corner and but God given us what we need in the hour that we needed amen I thank God for that tonight let's look at Isaiah 60 by the grace of of God if you got to say amen and it reads arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and the Kings to the brightness of thy Rising lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee by thy Sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be nourished at thide may God a blessing to the reading of his word tonight you know I know a lot of times scriptures have twofold purpose or meanings to them but tonight we just still want to talk a little bit and don't desire to be long on on the gross Darkness amen you know just looking at the way the world is going and it it does something sometimes to your spirit you know and I think I believe it's it's God that that open your eyes to certain things and he stirs up like they say sometimes your righteous indignation or whatever they call it but to to look at the way the world is going and and and he says thy light arise and shine for thy light is come but I always said and I was saying it this way for the last several weeks that you know light and darkness they're two different uh entities or things they have no fellowship with each other you know so uh God is forming Earth first thing he said let there be light right cuz Darkness upon the face of the deep who you know the first thing he called for was the light but he separated the two you know that because they can't they can't have fellowship with each other so you know if that light you know he says arise and shine for that light has come you know it even though the prophet Isaiah here was speaking about a time of darkness and gross Darkness but yet he still declared even in that time there would be a little light there but so but as we said that light can't have fellowship with Darkness right so the the the the more the you see the gross Darkness covering the land covering the people that's the more you start finding yourself detached from this world you you should find yourself every day the stuff you see longing for your future home a longing to see the cuz cuz we see the deceptiveness of the hour that's why we thank God for the message we've been studying here lately cuz we think we see the the deceptive deceptiveness of the hour we see the false anointed ones on the rise all over the land and deceive many but he said if it were possible they would have see the very elect so you and I we we take we don't take lightly what God has called us to we don't live that that kind of way any any kind of loosely but we we cherish I believe we should cherish the grace that God has G put on our lives and we should cherish Jesus spoke to them many times he said blessed are your eyes because you see and your ears because you hear many desire to see things and hear them but they don't hear it but it's a blessing so we should cherish these things that we can see the things that God has brought us out of but what it is it it it puts in us uh uh um you know it does something to your spirit it puts in you uh uh something that stir you up that way you see the battle raging you see the darkness that we fighting you see the the hour that we live in and and you got loved ones you got children you got got family you got friends you got all those that their eyes they can't see it they can't you know uh uh uh uh they don't understand it yeah but you pray that God it puts you in you to pray God open their eyes only only the spirit of God as we was ministering the other week God got to show you these things the man only understand these things by the spirit of God just by intellectual knowledge the same man that's maybe quoting it and talking and intellectual knowledge but don't have spiritual eyes to see it he just still in that Darkness a lot of times you'll find him quoting the same the same scriptures speaking the same thing but yet walking in that Darkness yet still walking in that because God by his Spirit hadn't revealed it to me yet but you look at yourself and say who am I Lord but you thank God that cuz what it is some kind of way at one point in your life maybe you saw yourself as being nothing you saw yourself as a sinner needing the grace of God you saw yourself as needing help and you were able to get low enough for God to come down and save you you know you start looking at your own life and and and and even now you said Lord we need you to we need you to to take take control take complete control don't don't allow me Lord at any moment to think I'm in charge Lord you take complete control from every as Lord You Take Control it's to the point you know now you you you just in prayer that that's got to be your main your main Drive prayer God I want to pray I want to I want to pull down strongholds I want to get to that place the way my communion with you is so strong because God I can't fight how else I'm going to fight I got to fight down on my knees many that are walking and more educated more knowledgeable can got more money than you and all these things but yet they walking in darkness but I say God help us and they might genuinely think that they're walking in light genuinely think that they're right and are good people right but you say what happened uh uh but God by his grace through election that's what it is God has elected you AR and you look at those things but I say as we're living in an hour of of not just darkness gross Darkness right Darkness cover the Earth but on the people uh it's a different type of Darkness right Darkness on the Earth but over the people it's a different type of Darkness a gross Darkness you know the people got a great Zeal to come to church but to know the things of God and to really uhh find the will of God for their life or to seek the mysteries of God or to seek the what's to come they don't have a Zeal for that but they have a great this the hour we live in they have a great Zeal to to be church members come on but why because the the Bible says that they'll be rich they say we we rich we increase with good we don't have need of nothing they got a Zeal to come to church but so far as having God like I David you know I always quote it how he says Lord search my heart and try my Reigns I'm I'm the king he the king but he constantly was asking God to search him and try him come on I was think how I believe it was Daniel when he was prophesying he said thou weighed in the F in the in the balance and found W come on but do you have that longing tonight for God to search and try you come on but we find that I says people got a great Zeal to come to church but not to know the not to know the spirit of God not for him to really take hold of their lives you know you think about it uh what it is it's a spirit though cuz you want them to be savior but not Lord save me from the bad times you know when the people going through going through hard times they they'll be the house of God most of them House of God praying you can't beat them you can't beat them being faithful but when things get easy come on I want a savior but I don't want a lord I got it from here I'm in control I got it from here come on but I said Lord what it is God has to take us and Shake us come on and wake us Shake us to The Hour That We Live shake us and let us know you need me now more than you ever did in the and as we looking at the Third Exodus we looking at this time we looking at the me and the boys at work been talking just within the every few years look like the world has went 30 years look like the world has moved centuries look like look like that was centuries ago but that the world was thinking that way but look at how far they've gone from that two years ago look how far it looked like things we only moved you say five years but 5 years ago look at the mindset how the mindset of the children has changed look how the mindset of the the the the the preachers have changed look how the mindset of church look at how the mindset of the people have changed just in that short period of time why cuz things are speeding up ain't it coming on you so fast coming on you moving so fast but I say as the mindset of the people has changed sometimes we ask God by our spirit God I know they're speeding up super fast but God don't let me speed up super fast in that way but slow me down enough that I can hear your voice because they're going into destruction they're going into a dark places they're going to that place but God I don't want to go into that place Slow Me Down enough that I can still still hear your voice Hallelujah I was sharing with somebody I said that's what it is we can be busy busy busy all that's going on and it takes up and then next say you know time gone time gone and you lost control you lost control I was telling somebody say you lost control of your home you lost control of your marriage you lost control because things was you were so busy things are flying you so busy that you lost control what used to be the foundation was God In Prayer Hallelujah putting him first you lost you had too much time you didn't have time to keep him first and if he's not first he can't guide you he can't lead you you out there on your own and if he don't slow you down at some point you'll be too far out there right made a mess of everything Hallelujah but I ask God don't let us do that how many want God to slow them down just a little bit tonight that they can hear his voice but what I say you know we live in that hour people have a great Zeal you see it all over don't you to come to church but but to really know the Deep things of God the really the the real um concern about their their soul salvation I says but you know the further that the the world goes into that realm you know that's the more you and I are going to stand out you know you'll be called crazy and all but but it it would be that the world like we says it' be that the world has lost their minds me and wife was talking cuz we can't get away from these things just the more even uh my wife was saying that she thank God cuz we we we studying this anointed ones at the end time and the people are very manifesting the things we looking at it just open your eyes you seeing it now had you had the Lord not not LED you these ways or or led the church these ways or it exposed these things sometimes you might be caught right up in it cuz you say I know that was God I know yes it was and but yet you caught up in it right but the thing is God has blessed God has blessed you or I come on to see certain things he blessed you and I to have a desire not only just to be a a hearer of the word but it's in your heart to want to do what the will of God is it's in your heart want to please God hallelujah but you find I says you know was looking at some things and I says you know my wife was looking at some things he was showing us some clips of of uh you know what the what the church world doing today you know and they bringing in the New Year certain way right you know and they but the way they're going is literally I mean I mean literally the club in the church literally it used to be you know they say just the rap gospel whatever they call it but now it ain't that it's just we going full blast everything we letting it all go we going to turn up tonight I said how does God look at that come on but they going going in but the the thing that that that that you look at is the people have no conscience people have no no um no consciousness word I want to I want but they have no it's no shame to it they have no nothing that tells them on the inside that this is wrong nothing to check them you look at they they do wrong and and they done it for so long the Bible says that when they knew God in Romans they worshiped him not as God come on see he said since they didn't like him to retain them in their knowledge he turned them over to his repivate mind the way they'll do these things and have no conscience they even know that this is wrong was talking at work the other day he says you know how how a dad in a home we was listening to somebody talk about uh uh the kind of how he want his the men to approach his daughters and how he want his daughter to marry a real man and how he talks to his young girls and how you know uh uh how they should consider this man you lay down with or man is is he going to be a real man that's not going to walk out on you is he going to be somebody you ra you want to you can see raising children a he was just going on and on but do you know the criticism that just by him talking like that the world bring on him today but what it is we've accepted the wrong for so long that when a man stand you and tell you what's right it's wrong now he he's wrong he's crazy that's what they do with the Natural Things even with the the spirit it is you've accepted the wrong for so long now and like we said it hadn't been long but it's been put in the minds of the people that now you wrong you're wrong but I says wrong is still wrong and right is still right no matter how everybody say let's change everybody say this is well everybody say well everybody else is doing it wrong is wrong and right is right come on and that ain't going to change y'all believe that tonight but just now they say you know you look at where where are the real I I was saying that the children they going to be confused because the same one somebody and wife was showing me some something where this great anointed singer anointed people got testimonies no no doubt under her Ministry but she's she's telling I'm standing on the Bible I'm standing on the word and everything she said sounded so good standing against this and standing against that everything she said sounded real good but at the same time you Pastor in a church and you're standing up there with pants on in the pull pit come on but don't say nothing you can't judge them come on who are you to judge and that's right but judgment begins where in the house of God right you don't have to judge the thing is you don't judge them but one day the very word you claim to be standing on going to judge you one day the very word the Bible you claim to be standing on that same word one day gonna judge you come on the same one you claim to love and that you serving and you worship you had a Zeal to come to church that same one one day G to say depart from me I never knew you he won't deny you didn't do the works come on but you left something out what was it you didn't wholly follow him come on like Joshua and Caleb they wholly followed the Lord not just when the times were good but in when when the odds were against them they still wholly follow the Lord hallelujah oh Jesus but we find that that's the hour we live in it it it it does it ought to when you see certain things it's not to laugh at not to laugh and make cuz it ain't funny it does something to your spirit come on I can see Jesus he walked into Jerusalem and saw what they was doing selling and buying in the temple it did something to him come on he ran them out didn't he because it bothered him how they was doing what they were doing in God's house come on and it started from the pool pit didn't it it started with the leaders allowing it to come in there didn't it Hallelujah but I says that this is the hour it ought to do something to you I said what it is the children going to be confused cuz the same preacher or the same person that's talking about Holiness and all they don't know what it is come come on you can't tell them no different from what the word word the the world is come on my wife is showing me something where they done took praise dancing to a whole another level now my wife said praise dancing would have been better to suffer that what they she showed me the other day but leave them alone come on we got the youth in church come on but there'll be confused to know what a real God is come on Hallelujah but I says Lord help us God as gross darkness is covering the the people Darkness Earth gross darkness is covering the people you still said that there be light somewhere I want to be in that light I want to walk in that light many think they walk in it but they Ain still in darkness many thinking they walk in it but they still living in darkness eyes are blind why the hour the Bible declared this hour would be like that you say you have need of nothing but you wouldn't know the condition your life was in come on in the eyes of God you didn't see yourself but he says come unto me and bow me eyes come on I mean buy me gold tried in the Fire come on let me give you eyes to anoint your eyes that you might be able to see God want to show you the condition your life is in in come on everything is Right everything is well no God want to show you the condition your life is in the richest man in the world miserable naked blind all these things God want to show you the condition your life is in Hallelujah I'm so glad that God showed me the condition that my life was in come on the road that you were on one day and you still ask God today try me search me show me where I'm at God come on I said what it is we got to get back to those midnight prayers those midnight crying that's the place where God we found him at got to get back to that but what it is something got to stir you up to get there something got to push you there something got to get you you know you could preach it people can try to manufacture it it's got to be God do it it's got to be God dealing with individual lives putting it on your heart to seek his face it's got to be God to do something in you to let you know get away from certain things come on and come back to me it's got to be God do that preachers can preach it yell out it cry out it people say oh that's just him mad with him but one day I always feel that that you we no new voice you hear on that day but the same preachers that cried out in your hour cried out to the word you thought it was just a man but it was God crying out to you the whole time I'm stirred you know why I'm stirred I I sh my wife something and I was saying you know I was telling how some boys was telling me how they did their sons and uh because how the the gang tried to get them or this tried to get them and or drugs or they Tred to be cool or all this other thing and how they had to handle their children when they were teenagers everybody say oh you wrong one of the boys say he don't believe even disciplin the child he won't do it nobody bet not put their hands on this child to discipline him I say he just a child right now but when he get to be a teenager or a young man he going to try you one day and then what then he talk what he going to do I said well that's that's backwards train them up any way they should go come on but everybody was talking about these boys and how they you did wrong you shouldn't have did that one of the boys his son got murdered we know this son cuz his son worked out there with us for a little while he he told him I wish I had have done that with mine and maybe he wouldn't it wouldn't have been the way it was come on and that's what I said somebody with experience need to talk to you and tell you come on somebody that that know what they talking about being through it need to talk to you and tell you about it come on Hallelujah that can't turn back the hands of time but what happened the people today in in in out there in church world the streets and all that they don't listen to the people with experience that been there they want somebody fresh somebody new that don't know what they talking about never been through no struggles no battles never been through no no no fights never had to go through the

religion that'll save you they don't want it come on but I'm telling you I want it by the grace of God how many want it tonight but I says you know do it do something to your heart come on are do it do something to your heart tonight to see the condition of the world does something right Eyes Up In You spiritually come on to put you on your knees more to say God I want to get closer to you because it's real ain't it I want to read something tonight by the grace of God he saying you know the prophet God was talking about Chicago he said what's what is the matter up here why this world in such Darkness why is gross Darkness upon the people heart why does the spirit call out constantly and the Gentiles are shutting their hearts from the message why are you because he said why are you because you are fed well you're clothed well know ye not that these mercies come from God come on he said why you in darkness why you why you rejecting the word why he says because you clothed well and you fed well but know ye not that these mercies it's only God's mercy that these mercies come from God you don't you don't you know that these mercies come from God I was telling my wife people want you to bless certain things want you to be a part of certain things or give you their give them your blessings but they don't want God in it they want God to bless it but they don't want him they don't want him part of their lives but they want God to bless what they doing come on that's wrong ain't it but the mercies of God come on God sometimes as I was sharing uh the church the other day God puts up with a lot of stuff we give him because he longsuffering but don't take God through that in 2024 don't take God what you took him through last year don't be better than where you were don't take God through that don't expect God year in and year out to keep putting up with what you give him come on because you wouldn't do it would you you'd have been shunn it away but I says I says but the mercy of God you know he says don't you know that these These are the mercies of God you he says know ye not these are the mercies of go these mercies come from God do you know the hour is coming when you'll be weeping and crying and mourning of these things and will you when you will not get them come on trying to tell the people you walking in darkness and why are you why are you pleased at it because things are going well but those are only the mercies of God in life don't you know the hour coming the hour coming When You Weep and cry for those same certain things and you won't get them come on but he says he says a wait while time is at hand and while you can receive God receive him come on how many want to receive God tonight come on how many examp examine yourself people got a Zeal to come to church or tied to certain organizations certain churches but you know so far as searching out the things of God Somebody went as far as to say something my wife was showing me somebody went as far as to say I know that's my pastor and I don't care I still love him because I know he's anointed of God and it might be true that he Anointed God might have used them to work miracles and all these things but I want God how many want God tonight amen consider your walk consider where you are tonight come on and let God search you [Applause] amen praise God he said consider your ways amen and I thank God that we can consider in 24 you know I thought about why he was preaching and my wife showed me something a while back Bishop Patterson he was over the Church of God in Christ and he had cancer and I think he was well he didn't have long to live and then he started telling the people about the makeup the earrings and uh pants and all of that things that had come in the church and he was saying you need to get back to Holiness and um I thought about him crying out Holiness you know people say you don't need a prophet I believe we need something some something that that God's going to judge man people might have thought they didn't need a Moses they didn't need a Joshua they didn't need Jeremiah they didn't need a they didn't need a Peter they didn't need a Paul but we need somebody thank God that he had seven stars in his hand and I'm glad that those he had a messenger for each age I'm glad in this last age that when you see the star and you comeing to worship him not the star but you come to worship Him the stars is only to lead you to where he is he's the word amen so we thank God and then I thought about one of the paay sisters I think that's the right name she was dine she'd come down she was they she started off they were just holding it people no makeup no their rigns you know singing and they got popular and got way out there next thing you know they had the make cuff the earring they was shining and showing at the end of the road she was dying and she said about in hell and she said I want to tell y'all sisters you know she took up all the makeup and all the earrings and all the fancy stuff talking about you need to go back to Holiness you see when it comes down to that people know that God is a holy God and telling them and warning them you don't want to face God all painted up and stuff like that telling them about it but now people don't know when you cross over I often time talk about the dream I had when I was a little boy and the prophet of God said he had that when he was dying he was on death bed and he woke up in hell and I was telling mine all the time I said I was in Hell one time and and I didn't know the prophet had the same type of experience until I started looking into the message and I heard him tell about when he was in Hell about the long fingernails and the women with the long fingernails and they was cl and it I said wonder why he saw women wonder why I saw women I don't know could have saw men but I didn't you know what I'm saying and um you were like witches in the yeah and people don't mind looking like a witch now but he said I saw and he saw that vision of of the Bride of the USA and the he he said they was dancing they was rocking going to rock and roll music and they were being led by witch and this he said this is the Bride of USA dancing to rock and roll music and being led by a witch I believe we'll come to that time like brother Ernest said it was dancing and the rap and all of that and dancing bringing the New Year in in the church have we gone that far I believe we have and don't don't you think within yourself that you have Abraham of your father don't you think that you're safe because you're in the message uhuh you ain't safe praise God oh we safe we in oh that don't cover you it's only you as an individual the blood of Jesus Christ covered in your life cuz I see some things you might have long dresses and no makeup and all of that but I see some stuff some hidden stuff it's going to come to the light people don't mind coming out you know people can be married two and three times you know done all kind of crazy stuff get up in the pullit and preach like nothing happened people hey travel the world just as lost as can be people listening to him I said Lord have mercy you know that person ought to be sitting down somewhere and they going on Anin it going on I said I'll be as sham of myself you know brother and sisters it come a time when people don't feel that repentance they're not afraid that they might be exposed they're go on but the prophet said it come a time it to be anit and seice days again people going to see that happen again a lot of people think we ready for that I don't know what we're ready for that but I believe it's got to come to pass for the church to get in order and who who knows things might might be already started and already gone taking place but people don't know that's why this is why that happened this is why that happened people don't know but God can make it sure because nobody would want to say that you know just like taking communion this caus many asleep sick and sleep among you because you're taking unworthy are you with me so what happens when people think they're getting by oh brother Simmons ought to do something about it no got somebody greater than brother Simmons oh the pastor ought to do oh you got somebody greater than that you can get a man and man can come being a bulldog or in the pull pit and going on like he's somebody and somebody uhuh this is collected thing the church is not just one just all head it's a body we all have responsibilities we all have a responsibility to keep God's house clean it ain't up to the pastor to keep it clean you got a home that you live in your house your children your family you're responsible for keeping it clean if you don't want to keep it clean don't ask the church to come and clean up what you ought to clean up you to raise your children properly tell them the right thing how to live how to walk how to talk you know take to the scripture you know they won't listen to you what you think they going to listen to the pastor they ain't going to listen to me if they won't listen to you you know what I'm saying it's just like the rich man when he died s last he said you want to listen to those that living they going to listen to somebody come from the dead are you with me so people say well you know you won't listen to your husband you won't listen to your wife won't listen to your mama you won't listen to Daddy you know what I'm saying we got to listen if it's right it's right it doesn't matter who's talking the word is right we all got to line up that word are you with me Holiness is still Holiness it doesn't matter how much people this how far people have gone they keep slipping slipping it it just started off a little I remember when they allot little earrings and just a shade just enough to cover some blemishes little makeup just to cover the blemishes that's just a little something nobody know you got it on just a little earring next thing you know got bigger bigger bigger you know okay A little makeup got a lot lot lot uhoh goodness what happened a little 111 to hold
