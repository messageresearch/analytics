we asking God for the people Lord God and a different bereaved families Lord we actually got to bless that word tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen you have your Bibles turn with into the book of Galatians the sixth chapter I was in the back there trying to figure out how I'm going to get all of this in but I'm not I pray God and just sum it up and maybe just save another part for another time we started kind of sharing it and then marrying the other night about this 15-20 minutes and as far as I could have get for the sake of time for the Galatians the sixth chapter 6 through 10. let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things I like being taught in the word amen be not deceived God is Not mocked but whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh she loved the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to his Spirit shall have the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us be not weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not let us pray father God we read your word God but I pray your spirit Lord the will oh God come and Quicken it Lord make the word come alive Lord we are in a season now and God you know only the season that we are in God you do things in a certain season father this is the season Lord God for the second coming of Jesus Christ Lord we've seen the Fulfillment of the word and God we realize that during the time that we are in oh God and we're running with all that we got Lord now we need a double potion of your spirit tonight oh God bless your people oh God I pray Lord for your anointing and Quicken Us in Jesus name amen amen maybe you seated you know I feel like shouting already listening to the song service and listening to this different song and I said Lord I see no this is a great time right now to praise the Lord uh I want to speak to you just in a few minutes this morning excuse that morning I'm already mourning already but I want to speak there on every on don't be weary in well-doing don't be weary in well doing the word weary it means to be exhausted uh you know low in strength your patient gets short and I believe that all of us at some times in our life we get a little weary I believe the Bible said one place that sends the Lord delayed his coming all thing continue as they were you know the words since the Lord hasn't come when people thought he should they begin to get a little weary about the journey some even decide that what's the use because we've been hearing the Lord is coming the Lord is coming for a long long long time but I still want to tell you he's on his way even so more now than it was back then I've reminded and hearing Paul and the different uh prophets and uh the ministers in the Bible they were speaking a lot of things concerning the end time talking about the great trouble and uh matter of fact let's go to one place there and I want to get this sin so badly I can't understand it second Corinthians and we're going to come back come in second Corinthians just a little peace we're not going to get all is that what I want though so much it's second Corinthians I said I believe is full um yes second Corinthians 4 and 8 there's two or three verses there Paul here was saying we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down oh my but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus Christ that the life also of Jesus Christ might be made manifested in our body we are facing trouble sometimes I like the way Paul put it he said we uh cast down but not destroyed another place Paul said in Romans 8 he says who shall separate us from the love of Christ you see a shield Trouse your tribulation he said they eat all these things we are more than conquerors I want to tell you tonight don't be weary in well-doing I know right look wrong and wrong look right but don't be weary something is about to happen I want to encourage you tonight all that you going through don't be weary Shake Yourself don't let nothing take your focus upon Jesus Christ I don't care what happens I don't care what comes I don't care where to go be still don't move hastily be sober be diligent wake I say on the Lord don't be in a hurry to move now soon as you'll be in a hurry that's when you mess up but if you can be still oh my my it's hard to get people to be still when they are troubled it's hard to get them to be still when they get a little wisdom but Church let's be still tonight oh my I like that so let's see he could have Let Me Drown oh so many times and a lot of us a lot of time thought we were going to drown oh but God came and he picked you up when you can even pick your own self up oh I like that I like it you know when he picked me up because then we rely more upon him and less of us you know I say the best time to have a Revival right in the midst of the storm brother I'll be the service God said in the darkest hour that's when the supernatural take place when everything is all tore up when people's minds are all on this and that our mind is on Jesus Christ I'm not gonna move to the left I'm not going to move to the right I'm going to work it right in the middle of the road Lord Keep Me in the word oh come on it ain't no time to leave the word now it's time to get anchored in the word Come On My Mind Is Made Up brother regardless of who or what or this or that one thing I know Jesus is mine oh my God mine mine mine brother Gardner Jesus Is Mine oh wow I feel good I'm telling you I know we all are suffering we're dealing with some hardships things beyond our control things that we didn't expect but I want to tell you God's still in control God's still in control of everything he knows exactly when you know how he knew what but then God got a season see there's a season I believe that you know the church a lot of time had got in such a comfortable Zone but God now is pulling those soft cushions come on those soft days and they don't relax times now it's desperation in desperation always bring God on the scene when the church get desperate for God and not looking to this other dad but I'm looking for you Lord that's how we ought to be we come to church don't come to church to spectate don't come to church to look around come looking for Jesus that's what we need um oh my Paul sound persuaded I wonder you persuaded today yes trouble perplexed distress but yet not destroyed let me read another scripture The Book of Psalms please I believe it's 37 I won't so many times when things begin to arise in our life and I'm learning this the worst time is to try to move away from God when things are not going like they ought the best thing to do then stay at brother children say I'm going to stay under the blood because under the blood is your protection if you go anyplace else you're leaving your protection it seems that I know by now that we ought to be a little more understanding the things of God that you know God ain't never in a hurry if you remember the story of those Hebrew boys God sat right there and watched them go into the fire you come from the beginning yes he could but he stood there and he looked he said now I got something in them I I know what they're going to do and they ain't gonna deny me regardless of what the Kings the crazy and he sit there and see God is a god of action God sat there looking on his people put them in a position that they had to make a choice come on somebody God would allow you to have to make some decisions and some choices brother Caleb to see where you really Act can you say I love you Jesus in the midst of what you're going through come on it's easy to praise God when things are good but how about we think you're real alone come on to God on the mountain in the garden of Valley you got to have the violence to be able to join the mountaintops no Valley no Mountaintop no child no Crown no suffering no Victory you got to be an overcoming in this hour oh whoa Lord have mercy I wish we had some real praises that can praise God even when they're going through come on ain't no time to be solid I believe a lot of times if we start praising God in the midst of it or what you're going through there the blessings that come down come on without weeping and it's looking sad we know who we believe we know that our God the real you got to be real to you you have to know God to be real not what nobody else say not what you're reading a book no matter what you hear on the tapes that same God got to be real to you personally every one of them got to have our own visitation your own experience that you can say that I know my redeemer do he lives you have to know that doesn't live with you can you call on them come on can you call on them in the Midnight Hour when nobody else know what you're going through he'll come see about you no no no you are not alone you are not alone he's right there waiting on you call upon the Lord why he can be found seek him now the disciples on a ship one day after having a Revival meeting Jesus was on the ship Jesus went down to the bottom take a little rest on the bottom of the ship and all of a sudden the storm came all that they were talking about testifying didn't begin to get a little weary worried about the storm and they forgot that Jesus was on the bottom come on somebody which time we forget who is on your ship we forget who is that living in you when the storms and wind begin to blow we forget that that same Jesus is the same yesterday in the day forever his power is the same he still is a miracle working God he still is a provider he still is a Healer he's still a Jehovah Jireh whatever you need God for why don't you call on it [Music] come on he's here oh yeah I know he's here brother you got to know I'm not doubting regardless how I feel or what I think he's here walking right in the midst of us he's right there with you in the midst of your crying worrying disgusting he's I say one place in the scripture fear not little flock what are you fearing almighty God the heavens the one that made the heaven in the Earth everything is under his control your life is in his hand the Bible say the footsteps of the righteous they are ordered you say but I'll make mistakes God to take that and make it a blessing to a true child of God a lot of times most of our mistakes that one brought us to God anyhow and God let you went down wrong Avenue and let you see you ain't nothing but a failure and that you can't live without me no you can't even live He's those bullets and things that that are spreading it because God did that your life that should have been gone God is the one that protected us even when you will gave up on God said I'm God and sometimes we get so alone we give up on our own self and then watch God then he know when to move there's a season we were in a great season right now a season that God already be with all of my heart he's preparing us he he is moving in the midst of the people of God he's trying to get them to the place don't you look at what you see don't you look at what's going on around you look to me Edward look to my promises that I gave you because not a winner none of my promises can fail come on somebody did not about to say that now why that's going out of my mouth it shall re not it will not return void but it will accomplish come on if you have faith to believe it God will bring it to pass or my servant of God said God is obligated not to you but to his word but he said if you abide in me and my I want you to work got to get in US come on not on you God want that way to get in you because God gotta God works according to his word well if you got no word in you he got nothing to work with but if I were to get in you oh God said yeah I can do something with this because they abiding they're standing still they're not hopping and scoping around they're sitting still because they know that I am here and they trust me or do you trust God tonight Saints don't be weary no time to give up now no time to back up I don't care what's going on go forward come on it's going to take a press in this hour like never it's gonna take more of us really pressing their brother pressing my way through through every obstacle though you may can't see your way out I'll be there to someone promotions saying that Jesus is a Waymaker come on way maker come on promise keeper we did what are you worried about he's a Waymaker when there isn't no way God Will Make A Way did not God open up the Red Sea who did it they couldn't go wrong undid or over it but God said now I'm going to show you what I can do he parted the Red Sea and they walked through on the waters was right there on the east side they could have probably feel it God will show them see what I can do I'm a miracle worker allow you to walk on dry ground in your enemies he destroyed them with the very water he had parted and that's how God will do your enemies come on a very enemy that's trying to hinder you oh don't let nothing in there Paul said he said you did run wild but what hinder yeah What stopped you from praying What stopped you from seeking God what hindered you from giving God all your praise oh my if I was taking all the bait I said you know we don't give God oh the praise he deserves we don't give God all the prayer we so we ought to praise Him higher higher the heart of the child Praise Him higher we ought to worship God with all of our heart oh my that's the kind of people that understand and have a revelation what they came here to do nothing Paul said what yahusha separate us nothing he said in all these things I want to say in all that you're going through you are more than conquerors disgrace trouble yes but not destroyed we've been knocked out but we got up we may have failed but I want to tell you it wasn't over yet you must have them kind of experiences in order to really appreciate what God is able to do let me tell you something there ain't nobody under the Earth on Earth can do you like Jesus can I don't care how good he is how much they say they love you they can't do what Jesus can for you too many times and God let us let people fail you let them feel you because sometimes we have too much of people we lean on and God said I want you to lead on me I want you to trust me even when you can't trust nobody else you can I will not forsake you there is the one police that God had forsook you and I may have been in some situation we've been in some condition that was very difficult even now and you know in this life it seemed like things keep on happening one after the other and we wonder sometimes Lord I'm tired and we get a little weak in the party that's when you got to go and pray up you got to get along somewhere and say God here I am Lord if there's nothing I can trust on nobody I can go to God that can give me what I need yeah let me tell you well I I understand no no no you really don't you understand physically but God understands everything there is about you he knows your weakness but in your weakness then you remain strong your mind just say that to change the strong man is the weakest link you're more stronger when you're weak it don't sound like that that's writing that ain't proper English sound like stronger when you're weak everybody I feel I can do it you got all the ability you got all the screen you got all the muscle physically but you can't fight one devil or for you you can't bring your own Deliverance even if you wanna the joy and what you were looking for inside of you you can do all this other thing and get this and get that and guess what you're still miserable but when you get something inside of you it will satisfy everything you ever need that's the problem with most people they try to satisfy a spiritual thirst for God with a a natural things it'll never take the place got people who was David said that my soul my soul thirsts after who see not materialistic things those things are temporal but you need an everlasting Joy you need something going to give you Joy even when you feel bad come on anyone that don't know what to do you can have some real consolation oh my I'm not going to read that script to you I'm going to read one place here I'm gonna turn over to Pastor server to God he was seen you know I I I read things and I hear server called speaking things and you know we have this uh little I say they call it a saying you know around this message of the album nothing wrong with it but to me I want to be more than just a sing and they always want to tell us you know say what the prophet said but I want more than just to say what he said I want to see God make that real you know what I want to see the manifestation brother not just what somebody said but God if that word isn't me manifest in our life you can say what he say all you like but what we need is something that takes place something to Quicken that word and make it live that it won't be just things sad brother but it'll be a demonstration of what was said and only the Holy Ghost can do that so if we're going to say don't be weary in well-doing for you will certainly reap in due season if you think not always he said always not sometime always do that which is right it's hard to do right when wrong going on see it's easy to get off but he said always do that which is right even if somebody else do wrong you do right that's like a sacrifice because sometimes you take Rome for right it is all right Jesus did that but will it probably we don't want to take nothing you have to learn that take something if you ain't willing to take you won't be able to appreciate a Christian Life is a suffering it's a sacrifice giving up your right for God right um that's where the people of God fail that God have to teach us and God has been teaching how he teaches through the things that you suffer through the thing that you go through in your daily life and it seems to be all that we have to deal with this let me tell you something there's a lesson in it that God is trying to get you to a place that you're gonna take something and go ahead and take it because see whatever you you you're the soul you're gonna reap he said always always always do that which is right and whatever that God has said in his book The Bible you believe that for you can hang your soul on any phase of the word of God now whatever he has promised in the word God will do but he is under obligation come on somebody stay with the word I said stay with the word don't be wearing well doing when things get rough and things get tough praise the Lord anyhow don't say come on uh don't let your problems get you down he said lift your head high and safe hey man praise God anyhow how many of you can praise God anyhow through circumstances through difficulties through even when you're sick through whatever it is I'm gonna praise God anyhow don't come to the church I don't feel that singing that's the best time the same then it comes real I I can remember Sister Irene Lord knows she went through a lot but let me tell you something she got up there the same she shook I mean like the heavenships because she had been singing pretty but she been singing Because of a testimony in a witness that she was of a life that she lived well how about you and I tonight come on let's have a real testimony that God has been good to you God bless you [Applause] praise God we thank God for the word tonight amen God is good amen don't be weary in well doing but you'll reap if you faint not

someone here Lord that's getting a little weary maybe there's someone listening in that's getting a little weary in well doing Hallelujah but God help them not to be weary you say brother Simmons

going on God [Music] Hallelujah Lord I speak to the heart somebody surrendered somebody yield somebody said God Amen I want to give my burdens but cards to you whatever it is under every trouble every problem every situation why don't you say God I surrender to you Lord for I can cast every care upon you because you care well all of you here you're sick if you have a need you're not saved you ought
