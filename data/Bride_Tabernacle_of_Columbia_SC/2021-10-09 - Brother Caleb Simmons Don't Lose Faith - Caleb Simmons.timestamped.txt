[36:52] amen
[36:53] joshua chapter 1 and it reads
[36:55] now after the death of moses the servant
[36:58] of the lord it came to pass that the
[37:00] lord spake unto joshua the son of nine
[37:03] moses minister saying
[37:05] moses my servant is dead now therefore
[37:08] arise
[37:09] go over this jordan thou and all this
[37:12] people unto the land which i do
[37:15] give to them even to the children of
[37:17] israel
[37:18] every place that the soul of your foot
[37:20] shall tread upon that have i given unto
[37:23] you as i said unto moses
[37:26] from the wilderness in this
[37:28] lebanon even unto the great river the
[37:31] river euphrates all the lands of the
[37:33] hittites and unto the great sea toward
[37:36] the going down of the sun shall be your
[37:38] coast
[37:39] there shall not any man be able to stand
[37:43] before thee all the days of thy life
[37:46] as i was with moses so i be with thee i
[37:49] will not fail thee nor for safety be
[37:52] strong and of good courage
[37:54] for unto this people shalt thou divide
[37:57] for an inheritance the land which i
[38:00] swear unto you
[38:01] unto their fathers to give them amen god
[38:04] bless to reading those where you may be
[38:06] seated
[38:08] amen i'd like to speak on a little small
[38:11] topic called
[38:12] don't lose faith
[38:15] amen don't lose faith now we know in the
[38:17] story here we reading about joshua and
[38:20] the children of israel crossing over
[38:22] jordan amen
[38:24] but if you go back previous in the book
[38:26] of
[38:27] in the book of genesis you read about in
[38:29] the book of numbers
[38:31] how moses sent 12 spies into the into
[38:35] what they call the promised land
[38:37] that god had promised them and they went
[38:38] to search out the land
[38:40] and they went to those they went to
[38:42] search it out and they found many things
[38:45] they found out that there were giants in
[38:47] the land there were walled cities in the
[38:49] land there was people
[38:52] a fearful people that they had never
[38:53] seen
[38:54] but and then they found that there was
[38:56] the land was flowing where god promised
[38:58] milk and honey it was a bounty for land
[39:00] it was a plentiful land
[39:02] and then when they came back to the
[39:04] children of israel
[39:05] they came back and there were ten spots
[39:07] to say we should not go up we should not
[39:10] go and possess this land because there
[39:12] are many adversaries in this land
[39:13] there's many problems in this land we're
[39:15] going to have to fight for it we're
[39:17] going to have to struggle for it we're
[39:19] going to go through some things if we go
[39:20] and we possess this land if we cross
[39:23] over jordan
[39:24] and but there were two people joshua and
[39:26] caleb that said no we are more than able
[39:29] to to to possess the land because god
[39:31] has promised it to and they're trying to
[39:33] encourage the people but those 10 spies
[39:36] they went they said if you if you say a
[39:38] bad word it makes it'll spread to 50
[39:40] people you say a good word it may spread
[39:42] to 10. so those bad spies they went and
[39:45] they sold the seed that we can't do it
[39:47] and they got the people behind them
[39:49] and they realized they convinced the
[39:50] people that we are not able to go up but
[39:53] joshua and caleb they never lost their
[39:55] faith they never lost in believing that
[39:57] god promised us this land and we're
[39:59] going to possess that land so they had
[40:02] so the people they didn't realize by not
[40:04] going into that land when god told them
[40:06] they was going to suffer
[40:08] there was a generation that was gonna
[40:09] have to pass away before they could go
[40:12] into that land and they sat there
[40:13] wandering in the wilderness going in
[40:15] circles
[40:17] because they didn't want to possess what
[40:19] god had given to them in the time that
[40:21] god had sent them sometimes you say lord
[40:23] i want to be in your will not my will
[40:26] because i don't want to be going in
[40:27] circles like they like they went in
[40:29] circles all that time
[40:30] and and joshua and caleb they said no we
[40:34] we want to possess the land and they
[40:35] eventually here in the book of joshua
[40:37] you see that moses had died and most of
[40:40] the people that had done the convincing
[40:42] they had passed away
[40:43] and
[40:44] now god said and i would say now you're
[40:46] able to go into the land he said every
[40:49] every ground that your foot shall tread
[40:51] on that you you're able to possess that
[40:54] land because he gave it to you all the
[40:56] lands of the enemies that you saw before
[40:58] god gave it to you and it's your land to
[41:01] possess amen
[41:03] and if you
[41:05] if you look on if you look in the book
[41:07] of um
[41:08] first kings chapter 17
[41:11] return to first kings chapter 17 amen
[41:22] first kings 17
[41:24] we see another person that didn't give
[41:26] up
[41:27] the giving that didn't give up
[41:29] that didn't give up their faith they
[41:31] held on if you read here in the verse 8
[41:34] it said in the word of the lord came
[41:35] unto him saying
[41:38] arise verse 17 and 8
[41:41] verse 9. arise get thee
[41:44] to z
[41:45] giraffe
[41:47] zeroff which belonged to zydon and
[41:51] dwelled there behold i have commanded a
[41:54] widow woman there to sustain thee so he
[41:56] arose and went to zarephath
[41:59] and
[42:00] when he came to the gate of the city
[42:02] behold the widow woman was
[42:04] there gathering of sticks and he called
[42:06] to her and said fetch me i pray thee a
[42:09] little water in a vessel that i may
[42:11] drink
[42:12] and as she was going to fetch it he
[42:15] called to her and said bring me i prayed
[42:18] the immorsal bread in thy hand and she
[42:20] said as the lord thy god liveth i have
[42:23] not a cake but a handful of meal
[42:26] in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise
[42:29] and behold i am gathering two sticks
[42:32] that i may go in and dress it for me and
[42:35] my son that we may eat it and die and
[42:38] elijah said unto her fear not go and do
[42:41] what thou has said
[42:44] but make but make me therefore a little
[42:46] cake first and bring it unto me and
[42:49] after
[42:50] make for thee and for thy son
[42:52] for thus said
[42:54] saith the lord god of israel the burial
[42:56] of meal shall not waste neither shall
[42:59] the crucial oil fail until the day that
[43:01] the lord sinneth reign upon the earth
[43:03] amen
[43:04] in this story you see the servant of god
[43:07] elijah god has sent him by the brook by
[43:10] the brook um and he was getting fed by
[43:12] the ravens god was sending him food
[43:15] by the ravens and they was they were
[43:16] sending him but one day the brook dried
[43:18] up so god said go down to this city
[43:21] there's one there's a widow woman there
[43:23] that i'm gonna have to sustain you and
[43:26] he went down there and he saw the widow
[43:27] woman now the widow woman she was out
[43:29] there
[43:30] gathering two sticks to make a meal for
[43:32] her son her and her son and she
[43:35] basically got to the point this is the
[43:37] end
[43:38] we don't made it this far but this is
[43:40] the end
[43:41] but but something when elijah told her
[43:43] to make the cake for him first
[43:45] she she said but i only got this little
[43:48] bit and he said go ahead and make it for
[43:50] me first and uh and if you make it for
[43:53] me first then you'll then your meal and
[43:56] your oil won't won't run out none until
[44:00] the rain comes and so you see in the
[44:02] story where the woman she could have
[44:05] would could have not listened
[44:07] she could have went about her way and
[44:08] said you know what i don't he talking
[44:10] foolishness let me move on just make
[44:13] this and let's go ahead and
[44:14] we'll we'll make it somehow if we make
[44:17] it if we don't but she she didn't lose
[44:19] faith in the words that elijah told her
[44:21] she didn't she didn't stutter she said
[44:23] you know i'm gonna go do this and and
[44:26] see if it happened if it come to pass
[44:28] then so be it if it don't well we was
[44:30] gonna perish anyway so so she didn't she
[44:33] didn't lose her faith in the larger he
[44:35] had faith in her that she was gonna do
[44:37] it because god told her that she was
[44:39] there if she was gonna sustain them amen
[44:41] and that's just one of the that's one
[44:44] example in the bible that you see where
[44:47] where you don't give up your faith don't
[44:49] ever lose your faith
[44:50] but in the scripture if you go down in
[44:52] james it says but faith without works is
[44:55] dead
[44:56] so if you if you can have all the faith
[44:58] but if you ain't doing nothing about it
[45:00] then you'll never achieve nothing you'll
[45:02] never push forward and god you'll never
[45:04] get down and you never if you don't
[45:06] spend the time in prayer and fasting and
[45:08] getting closer to god and seeing exactly
[45:11] what he wants then you will never get
[45:13] reap the benefits
[45:14] i wrote i wrote down the lord's when
[45:16] dealing with me i said sometimes if
[45:19] you're in school sometimes you're going
[45:21] to school and sometimes you can get to
[45:23] the place where you're going through the
[45:24] motion
[45:25] but some came to me and said
[45:27] how can you expect to get a grades but
[45:30] you're giving c effort
[45:33] how can you expect to get a grades but
[45:36] you're given c effort now sometimes you
[45:38] might you might multiple choices just
[45:40] write and get an a but
[45:42] there's a times where you need to know
[45:45] what you're doing you need to understand
[45:47] that the hard work and the hard effort
[45:49] that i'm putting in is going to reap
[45:51] benefits in the future you may not see
[45:53] it now but you you looking for the
[45:55] harvest not for not for the seeds that
[45:57] you planted in the ground
[45:59] and so he said and just thinking about
[46:02] it sometimes we do god the same way lord
[46:05] i'm expecting big blessings but i'm not
[46:07] praying
[46:08] i'm not reading my bible i'm not fasting
[46:11] i'm not trying to get closer to you i
[46:13] can barely make it to church sometimes
[46:15] but i'm expecting god you to do x y and
[46:17] z for me because you said that you was
[46:20] going to do it and god said where's your
[46:22] effort
[46:23] where where is where's do you you got to
[46:26] you got to do something you got to put
[46:28] in the effort to show forward that i can
[46:30] trust you he in the story in the bible
[46:33] he gave
[46:34] there's a story where jesus told the
[46:35] parable where he gave one man five
[46:37] talents one man three times and one man
[46:39] one talent the one with five when
[46:41] doubled his talents the one with three
[46:43] win doubled his talent but the one with
[46:45] one he went and buried his talent and
[46:47] said lord i knew that you were a hard
[46:49] master so i didn't want to lose it and
[46:52] the lord came back and he he took his
[46:54] talent and gave it to the one with five
[46:56] and said because he knew what to do with
[46:58] it he was putting forth the effort he
[47:00] said even if i lose i'm gonna win
[47:03] even if i lose lord i may win i might
[47:06] lose out on some friends i might lose
[47:08] out on some some things of doing in this
[47:10] life but if even if i lose i'm going to
[47:13] win i'm going to make it all i want to
[47:15] do is make it lord and if i got to lose
[47:17] a few things over here to make it lord
[47:20] take him away lord search me o god and
[47:22] try my reins lord amen you're looking
[47:25] and you say david said that that lord i
[47:27] want you to search me lord create me a
[47:30] clean heart oh lord and renew a right
[47:32] spirit and means and you're looking lord
[47:35] i want to put forth the effort lord not
[47:37] not just giving the faith but giving the
[47:39] effort for it lord i know that you can
[47:41] you you do what you said you can do now
[47:43] i got to do what you told me to do he
[47:45] said pick up your cross and follow me
[47:48] and the cross is not a light thing it
[47:49] was not a light piece piece of wood that
[47:52] you had to carry up a hill but he said
[47:55] pick up your cross and follow me that
[47:57] meant that whatever
[47:58] what whatever you was he was going to
[48:00] give you you was going to have to work
[48:02] for it you was going to have to make
[48:04] some sacrifices you was gonna make some
[48:06] you was gonna have to do do some things
[48:09] to make it yeah it wasn't gonna be
[48:11] he said my yoke is easy but my burden is
[48:13] light so if you get he said that he was
[48:16] you were gonna get these things but then
[48:18] you have to turn them over and give it
[48:20] to him amen
[48:22] and i wrote down something else he said
[48:25] said right now um
[48:28] whatever you're going through sometimes
[48:31] it's only a test
[48:33] it's only a test
[48:34] and when you know that it's just a test
[48:37] it'll change your attitudes towards the
[48:39] situation it'll change how you react to
[48:42] the situation because you realize lord
[48:45] you're only building my character god
[48:48] you're only taking me through to show me
[48:50] where i am
[48:51] sometimes god gotta take you through
[48:53] something to show you you need to pray
[48:55] more you need to study more you need to
[48:57] get get closer to me you you ain't where
[49:00] you think you are and and god god shows
[49:03] us these things in life and it's like
[49:05] lord are we listening are we paying heed
[49:08] so that we don't lose our faith in you
[49:09] we don't we don't we don't we realize
[49:12] that these things are only a test the
[49:14] end goal is to make it in
[49:16] lord everything that i do lord i want it
[49:19] to be pleasing to you so when i get to
[49:21] in front of you lord i want to hear well
[49:23] done good and faithful servant enter
[49:26] into my rest and lord in just
[49:28] understanding
[49:30] lord whatever i do i want to put the
[49:32] works behind it to push forward because
[49:35] it's all about how you respond
[49:38] it's all about how you respond to to any
[49:41] situation you look at abraham in the
[49:43] bible
[49:44] abraham waited 25 years
[49:47] for the thing that god had promised him
[49:50] and then later on when when isaac got a
[49:52] little bit older god sent abraham and
[49:54] told him to go sacrifice him and
[49:58] it looked counterintuitive but abraham
[50:00] he didn't lose faith in god he saw what
[50:03] god had done so far so he said
[50:06] so he went and he went he took he took
[50:09] eyes and a few servants and they went on
[50:11] a journey they went on the journey to a
[50:13] mountain and he left the servants at the
[50:14] base of the mountain and isaac asked him
[50:16] once they got there he said where's the
[50:18] sacrifice abraham said the lord will
[50:20] provide
[50:21] he didn't tell him what what the plan
[50:23] was and then when he got up there he
[50:26] laid the altar out and he he got ready
[50:28] and then he tied isaac and put him on
[50:30] the altar and was getting ready to
[50:33] to to take him out and the lord stayed
[50:35] his hand
[50:36] and and sent a ram in the bush to
[50:38] sacrifice on on that altar abraham it
[50:42] was about how he responded to the things
[50:44] that he was going through he didn't lose
[50:46] faith in god because it was a test on
[50:48] the trial he didn't lose faith in god
[50:50] because it seemed
[50:52] it seemed absurd to the natural man he
[50:55] didn't lose his faith he he responded in
[50:57] the right way
[50:58] uh
[50:59] and the prophet of god he said
[51:03] and he was talking about the story of
[51:05] moses and he said god took moses in the
[51:07] backside of the desert and he had to
[51:09] teach him and he said
[51:15] he said and god called the man
[51:18] that was moses
[51:20] but moses was a great deal like us every
[51:23] time we come to a place to something had
[51:25] to be done moses every time we come to a
[51:28] place just something had to be done
[51:30] moses called out oh lord what must i do
[51:33] in this place
[51:34] now isn't that just like we do god had
[51:36] blessed him and anointed him above his
[51:39] brother and given him a message in a
[51:40] ministry that had not been on the earth
[51:42] since that day until that day and yet
[51:45] every time something taken place moses
[51:48] run off to god with the lord what must i
[51:50] do what must i do in this case
[51:53] god kind of got kind of a tired of it i
[51:55] believe and said why are you crying to
[51:57] me speak to the people and go forward my
[52:00] if any time ever look like they ought to
[52:03] retreat was man but god has no retreat
[52:08] any time ever looked like they ought to
[52:11] retreat was then but god has no retreat
[52:13] sometimes you you're going through life
[52:15] and you're facing certain things and
[52:16] look like i should be going back but god
[52:19] doesn't retreat
[52:20] he goes there's no place to retreat in
[52:23] god go forward the doctor says it's
[52:26] cancer go forward if he says it's tb go
[52:29] for it if the devil says you can't give
[52:31] this up go for it if your home says that
[52:34] you're going to be a fanatic go for it
[52:36] the church turns you out go for it
[52:38] there's no retreating
[52:40] back go for it speak and go forward
[52:43] sometimes you got to get to that place
[52:44] lord i gotta go forward
[52:46] i'm tired of getting knocked back and
[52:48] knocked down and situations coming at me
[52:50] from all which ways lord i gotta go
[52:52] forward i wanna put in the time put in
[52:55] the effort to go forward lord lord push
[52:57] me forward lord lead and guide me and
[53:00] lord let me speak your word he says
[53:03] speak what speak his word go forth thus
[53:06] saith the lord and move on
[53:08] you got to go forward in god you want to
[53:10] make that logical you want to make that
[53:12] transition lord
[53:14] lord lead me forward lord guide me god
[53:18] in my footsteps and lord don't let me
[53:20] lose faith in you let me get stronger
[53:23] let me focus on you more lord let me
[53:25] take the time lord to get closer to you
[53:28] lord i want to move forward i want to

[53:52] closer lord lord push me forward let's
[53:55] let's go forward let's go forward as a
[53:58] church you see the signs of the times
[54:00] and the things that are happening in the
[54:01] world and you see the time is getting
[54:03] shorter and shorter and we got to we got
[54:06] to be preparing to go somewhere
[54:08] we got to be preparing to get our life
[54:10] in order to go somewhere lord push me
[54:13] forward let's go forward in god let's
[54:16] not lose our faith let's not give up
[54:18] hope let's go on and let's let's cry out
[54:21] for the ones that are falling by the way
[54:23] because god is the one that can bring
[54:25] them back because this is only a test
[54:27] you don't know what your prayers could
[54:29] be doing for someone else keeping them
[54:31] helping them pushing them forward and
[54:33] god continue to put that hedge around
[54:35] them that the devil don't take them all
[54:37] the way
[54:38] lord jesus lord let me push forward let
[54:41] me go forward let me lord let me ask you
[54:44] for direction lord lead and guide me

[55:12] and where you're supposed to report
[55:14] everything that you do while you're
[55:16] working every 15 minutes
[55:19] you know what that showed me i wasted a
[55:21] lot of time
[55:22] i waste a lot of time and i said
[55:24] sometimes
[55:26] how much more time would i have if i
[55:28] just looked at how much time i'm wasting
[55:30] and spent
[55:32] five percent more doing something that
[55:34] was productive
[55:35] what would i be able to achieve
[55:38] lord what would i be able to do what
[55:40] would you be able to use me for if i
[55:42] spend five percent more time letting you
[55:45] allowing you to use me being on one
[55:47] accord with you spend five percent more
[55:49] time praying
[55:51] instead of watching things and doing
[55:52] different things listening to things
[55:54] lord if i spend 10 10 to 15 minutes more
[55:57] praying than i do right now what would
[55:59] you what would the impact be on my life
[56:02] what would the impact be on someone
[56:03] else's life
[56:05] what would the impact be if if sometimes
[56:08] i said we need to be
[56:09] prayer champions you think of a game
[56:12] that you may be playing sometimes you're
[56:14] on level one and level and there's
[56:16] different levels to a game and and you
[56:19] see the person that wins it all they
[56:20] become a champion and says sometimes
[56:23] lord i want to become a prayer champion
[56:25] i want to be someone lord that that i
[56:28] reach my heart when i reached my highest
[56:30] level you find me on my knees you find

[57:09] amen
[57:13] don't lose faith amen
[57:15] you know i was uh ministering on sunday
[57:18] be it unto me according to thy word
[57:21] you know i said one thing is
[57:23] you know about it's the way you look at
[57:26] the situation
[57:27] i says you know
[57:29] the way you look at the situation to
[57:31] change the whole thing
[57:32] i said you know that first one that
[57:34] angel came to mary
[57:36] and he began to give her a salutation
[57:39] one of the first things he began to tell
[57:40] her he says that you blessed and highly
[57:42] favored
[57:43] i says what it is
[57:45] mary might not even been known to
[57:47] anybody in the world at the time but her
[57:49] family and the people around her
[57:51] but yet when the angels seen the first
[57:53] thing he told her you blessed and you
[57:54] highly favored
[57:56] and i believe that you know that might
[57:58] have caused her to look at herself a
[58:00] little different come on and nobody
[58:02] don't know who i am but the lord he said
[58:04] i'm blessed and highly favored
[58:07] so i began to think about that and dwell
[58:09] on that a little bit i said come on and
[58:11] no matter what you're going through in
[58:12] life right now no matter what you're
[58:13] faced with right now i said to be here
[58:16] with blood running warm in your veins
[58:18] come on i said when when you think about
[58:20] all your good days
[58:22] and i was telling my mom
[58:24] it was coming up she was telling me some
[58:26] things and you know it was on a heart
[58:28] and all i said yeah i said but you know
[58:30] you think about those bad days i said
[58:33] but think about those good days come on
[58:36] i said and those good days like that
[58:38] song says they outweigh all of the bad
[58:40] come on and i said you got something to
[58:42] praise god about
[58:44] you know that angel i said like i said
[58:46] it might have startled her but he said
[58:48] you blessed in highly favored but her
[58:50] question was you know as the brother
[58:52] caleb who knows preaching on don't lose
[58:53] faith her question was was lord how can
[58:56] this be
[58:58] and he began to tell her he said he says
[59:00] the holy ghost gonna overshadow you and
[59:02] that thing that's gonna come from you is
[59:04] gonna be you know a blessing you know we
[59:06] know the scriptures and all and then but
[59:09] her reply was well lord be it unto me
[59:12] come on
[59:13] according to your word and i said that's
[59:16] what we got to start when we look at the
[59:17] word of god that way not looking at oh
[59:20] how's it going how is this going to
[59:22] happen no we ain't looking at it that
[59:24] way what we're saying god be it unto me
[59:27] come on i say if you challenge with a
[59:29] sickness tonight what what is it oh the
[59:31] doctor might have said this about it and
[59:33] that and they might have said we got to
[59:35] do this to repair this oh but come on
[59:36] but the word of god says that he was
[59:39] wounded for our transgressions
[59:41] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[59:44] chastisement of our peace was upon him i
[59:46] said sometimes you know we're living in
[59:48] a world where we have all those restless
[59:50] nights and we got a lot of things on our
[59:52] mind but don't you know that when he
[59:54] went up to calvary he was whip wounded
[59:56] and all these things the chastisement of
[59:59] our peace was upon them and he says they
[1:00:01] that keep their mind on him he'll keep
[1:00:03] him at what perfect peace come on and as
[1:00:06] he says that with his stripes you are
[1:00:08] healed come on
[1:00:09] and that's what he says so no matter
[1:00:11] what the report is come on be it unto me
[1:00:14] according to thy word oh lord i started
[1:00:17] looking at certain blessings and certain
[1:00:19] things that god said about us and i said
[1:00:21] what it is be it unto me
[1:00:24] i said be it unto you tonight according
[1:00:26] to the word of god
[1:00:27] why because the thing is it ain't it's
[1:00:30] it's the way we change in the way we're
[1:00:32] looking at the situation
[1:00:34] as our brother caleb was saying you're
[1:00:36] changing we're changing the way we're
[1:00:37] looking at it
[1:00:38] not that oh i can't do it but we're more
[1:00:41] than able
[1:00:42] you know it's kind of striking because
[1:00:45] brother caleb went to joshua one that's
[1:00:47] what me and the children been reading
[1:00:49] all week long is the book of joshua and
[1:00:51] going over how you know howdy says that
[1:00:54] hey and and caleb was going over how he
[1:00:56] was talking about when they went to spy
[1:00:57] out the land how there was walls cities
[1:00:59] in the land and all these things and but
[1:01:01] even though they were all that in the
[1:01:03] land joshua and caleb eyes wasn't
[1:01:05] looking at none of that was it
[1:01:08] it was looking at a god that brought
[1:01:09] them this far
[1:01:11] it's more than able to take them the
[1:01:13] rest of the way
[1:01:14] so what do we look at tonight come on a
[1:01:16] god that brought us this far
[1:01:19] i don't know the brother of him was
[1:01:20] telling me tonight 50 years he coming up
[1:01:22] on i said god brought you a long way
[1:01:24] didn't he and he's still blessing you a
[1:01:26] god that brought you this far come on
[1:01:29] it ain't nothing that we've never seen
[1:01:31] before come on the bible says that that
[1:01:33] which has been that which is nice
[1:01:35] already been come on ain't nothing new
[1:01:37] under the sun the same god that whipped
[1:01:39] the devil back then is the same god
[1:01:41] that's going whip them right now how
[1:01:43] many believe that the same god that
[1:01:45] opened the red sea is the same god
[1:01:46] that's gonna open doors right now the
[1:01:48] same god that healed that said i'm the
[1:01:50] lord that god that healeth thee that
[1:01:52] heals it in he gonna heal you right now
[1:01:54] why because he said i'm the lord and i
[1:01:56] change not he's the same yesterday what
[1:01:59] today and forever now be it unto me come
[1:02:02] on according to thy word this it's how
[1:02:05] and that's why he says don't lose your
[1:02:07] faith it's how you look at the same
[1:02:09] situation saints
[1:02:10] come on that same god he's that same god
[1:02:14] i was thinking about david and how you
[1:02:16] know the bible says that when when the
[1:02:18] champion goliath come on when he came
[1:02:20] out boasting everybody was afraid of him
[1:02:22] wasn't he
[1:02:24] shaking in their boots

[1:02:28] was the difference he was looking at a
[1:02:29] situation different wasn't he
[1:02:32] he wasn't looking at that giant but he
[1:02:33] was looking at god was with me back
