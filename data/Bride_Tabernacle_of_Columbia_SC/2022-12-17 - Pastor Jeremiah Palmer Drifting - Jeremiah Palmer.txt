word tonight that you are blessed oh God the word God have preeminence in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen [Music] have your Bibles turn with us to the Book of Revelation the second chapter [Music] Revelation 2 very familiar text I know we have heard it so many times and I know even myself have maybe spoken it maybe not from the angle tonight that we want to try to work with it amen for a few minutes in Jesus Christ's name but Ephesians 2 and 1. it said the first verse said unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven going in candlesticks I know that works in that labor and our patience how thou can is not bear them which are evil and that has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and found them Liars has born in his patient and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from Winston falling and repent and do the first works or else I'll be coming to the quickly and we remove that Candlestick out of that place except thou repent father may you bless the word tonight God may you Quicken it in Jesus name we pray amen and be seated many of us I know are acquainted with the age of uh Ephesus and we are acquainted with what was going on if you remember that age which was the age that Paul was the messenger and Paul was uh setting that church or started off with the church with the things of God establishing them into faith in the word that God gave him for that particular generation and we understand that in that age the people were on fire for God they love the word of God that he had sent to them they kept the things that Paul were teaching and you know just like everywhere when God began to move the devil moved too and here uh this church here had a lot of things that was beginning to take place yet it was in little form it wasn't all so outward what was going on but it was hid it started out gradually until it began to fully manifest itself and I want you to understand that this was a spirit here that I'm working with here called the spirit of drifting or drifting uh and um we understand that uh that spirit is very much even real right now um we understand that these Spirits throughout the ages they started off uh like I said in a mile not all known and then from one age to the next it increased in it uh begin to show itself more and more in another form and this Spirit here I would say is it with the spirit of antichrist that begin to move in on this age here which the people and as God had commanded them you know that uh he know what they works and they labor and their patience so they will actually laboring for the things of God they were patient they they even were very keen to uh people that had crept in and began to uh cause them to get away from the things of God it's one place it said that uh they have some people that were saying they were Apostles and they said they tried them and found them to be Liars you know and it's always good cause about to say try the spirit and see river is God or not see and in Paul even wanted them even before the eight he said now after uh my departure he said the Grievous wolves were going to come in and begin to scatter the flock um and we noticed that this word of relaxing or drifting uh that's what that word the emphasis mean it means relaxing or or drifting and I looked up the word drifting and uh somebody said that it's a gradual shift not all at what what a gradual shift in Attitude opinion our position to vary or to deviate from a course see or adjustment in other words that they started aiming at God um they was focusing um on the things of God but did it it became a gradual shift in the people attitude in other words and we see that even now we're seeing a a gradual shift in people's attitude uh it don't even matter whether it didn't miss church no more but it wasn't all something like what but it came in a liberal form and you know you missed one and you know you missed two and and before you knew it you just become a Sunday or or just with a meeting is called you know but it was something that gradually and this is a spirit that comes into anoint us to get relaxed to get so comfortable that oh it'll be all right I'll do better after a while and then after after a while I'll leave we don't have the scrithing US uh that desire that you what has he that that desire for prayer desire to to heal from God to for God to speak and you hear the voice of God the love for God begin to you know get a little cold you know we're still coming to church and um we still like coming to church but it used to be a time there was a zeal there was a a fire of God that we couldn't wait until we get to the house of God but now it become within beginning to take it easy now in Zion see because we got more now we got better things and uh now we uh are now are doing much better than we used to naturally we got more than we ever had all of us do but yet even in that the things of God in our lives go like him the more of the world you we accumulate the less of God we begin to it is very hard to uh to a lot of times to get a balance you know there's nothing wrong with God blessing you with things but a lot of time those things begin to mean more to you because now you got a battle to keep them all and now it requires more of you it require more of your time that now I don't have to have time to pray like I used to I don't have time to really study and to seek God because I have a business schedule long way you're busy we are so busy busy busy people and yet we are just working ourself until we get sick now we need God to heal us you know they say whatever you put in is what you're going to get out but you know God is still good God Even in our ignorance to things and sometimes it's not it's our willfully do it because I know by now we'll we know better we have heard so much truth we've we've heard so many things that have been taught and we have heard so many preachers and teachers even the Sunday school and all those things but look like the more we hear the less we do and it's a spirit that that anoints the people to begin to back up from God from the things of God you know and that's what was happening in the age of Ephesus they got to a place that when these people kept in these apostles no doubt they begin to cause the people to get away from the word giving them maybe a substitute that you know it don't take quite all that no more that's what I used to hear a lot you know special when God you know had a standard that he's calling for and God don't change his standard for the match us we must change our standard to match God's standard and God sets a high standard it's a scrape and it's a narrow road not many gonna be able you know to stay on this road because it requires a sacrifice it requires you really knowing how much does it mean to me and what how much does God means to you how much do you value your soul can we afford to back go backwards I don't know about you but I don't have the time to it takes too much out of you to to go backwards and then trying to play catch-up you know it's something that you know sometimes people think they got time they got time to get it together sister and brother the time is now the time is now that we really examine our own self you know and look at ourselves in the mirror of the word and begin to say Lord help me and you can feel you know our spirit the driftingness the comfortableness the less passion your love for God like you used to you know some say one place say take me back to the old landmark you know how it used to be a time that the people of God uh would really make sacrifices because they didn't want to miss anything that God is doing there used to be time they sell you know that I used to get off of work early we used to going up back on truck to go to the meetings pack up all of our children and go to the services not even ever have enough money but we ate sandwich bologna sandwich and cheese but we were happy we were going to hear something from God it doesn't matter you know what you rolled in or what you had that that didn't even matter to us the only thing matter Lord we want you and that's all it auto matters now the more God blessing you the humble you should be the more you have naturally you're going to say Lord now I can do more for you but what do we do we drift the way we become cold starchy less concerned about our own soul with less concerned about what it really takes to keep us on fire what does it really take to keep us with a Zeal for God because I know all of us sit down get a little Slack but you have to pinch yourself you have to really know that uh the devil is not playing now we are fighting demonic powers and the servant of God say that you know the devil waiting for that knockout punch that place you get to where you know a lot of people especially nowadays you never tell me Mary that you know you're on a thin line you are just walking a very close line for the devil how can you read all out as I heard the servant of God was saying he said you know as hard as he preached against things and sin and thing he said when they come back the people get worse spiritual drifting and it's hard for us to uh to really understand um what your Zeal for God means to you until you lose it and when you lose that fire in that zeal I don't know about you but it makes me very uncomfortable because you know I want to feel the presence of God you know I just don't want that anointing God to lift up off of me and I just walk and begin to do anything say anything go anywhere it doesn't matter whether I do it doesn't matter even what nobody say about me because I'm gonna do my own thing and I'm afraid you know yes you can do your own thing but when you wake up and find out y'all thinking thought about Sampson you know how he started out destroying Philistine because that's what God raised him up to do to destroy the Philistines and then after a while something you know he had a job on his ass that he killed a thousand he had a lot of Victories and a lot of God was with samps I mean destroying his intimacy but the council got to a place that he played around with his salvation he played around with with one of the Philistines that he should have had destroyed he he just flew around just with one of them and that one was responsible for taking him out because see the devil knew Samson weakness and no doubt he stood himself and he studied us to find out your weak areas how can I take that Joy you got uh what can I give you to replace it the way it becomes more to you than God does everybody you want to replace give you a substitute for God and most that it'd be worldliness more here less there and you prosper naturally oh you're doing good naturally but where's your prayer life where is the presence of God oh my consecration you know it's hard to get people to consecrate your flesh don't even want to do it you have to battle your own flesh they even get breakthroughs in prayer that need answering and people need Deliverance it's sad that we come to church bound with problems and we leave the same way come on this ought to be a place where the power of God ought to be here but you're the one got to bring it we want the preacher to death preacher you pray you pray you pray but how about us were we gonna start dropping the Lord on the pastors I'm understanding that now and it shouldn't be you and I the people of God yes I know you got condition yet we got them too but it's something about it we have to press our way through the brother go out and sing that song yes you have to press your way through ain't nobody gonna be able to do it for your sister brother not depressed you have to forever and ground you want to get there used to be a time we could say come on come on y'all and God had mercy but now he leave it up there each and every one of us to get desperate and begin to cry out God I need you but as I say they never know how to give us something to substitute what we really need we always think we need more of this and more of that that might be what you want what you need is God you're gonna find out all these materialistic things that we label so hard to get and y'all know when you get it guess what it don't mean no more to you not even got to find something else you want it is just material but come on Bible says seek ye first come on seek God first in everything else to be added but we seek Earthly and then we forget about the spiritually and then we find ourselves like Samson Samson the Philistines upon thee and he played with Delilah too many times we play around with the devil too many times we occupy ourselves we do it because you got a choice that you can make and remember this the choice you make now is going to have an effect on you later so the choice that you make sister brother examine that by God's word be sure Lord is this your will for me or is the devil trying to give me a substitute children lives and getting them all messed up and Tangled Up and the deal with the slow walking he didn't know her either he's a slow walking has given us a little this in a little that you know and I think we ought to thank God for everything that God does for us but sister and brother if that thing that whatever you're getting is taking you away from God it ain't worth it I know you might say I needed your brother Jeremiah let me tell you something you're gonna need God more than you need any kind of money and we are going to find out I believe it's happening we're going to find out that your money can't heal you when you're going through a crisis and you being been bonded by demon powers your status in this life is not going to be able to get you out of that situation you're going to have to know your God as I said Simpson played around he started out three times playing with her playing with the playing with did the bible say that she vexed his soul in other words she would have determined to find out what whether it was a spirit that had noted her and these Spirits can get strong they can bombarded you so that where you know it gets so bad that we'll fake actually that is God but still some drifted drifted so until he told her his secret and when he told her she called for the Philistine to come in and what did he do they plucked his eyes out so he could no longer see the revelation of the word for his hour he knew what he was called to do but he allowed the devil to scrip it what did he use his weakness what are you like what do you really really want more than God watch The Devil bring it to you and the very thing he loved with the very thing that destroyed him cut his hair his loss cut his power off that's what the devil do cut your power off cut your revelation of the word off the way you are not even bathing in the word and getting the inspiration from God anymore all you can do is work and gain here but the time that you used to spit listening and reading the word the servant of God say if you want a closer walk with God he said read your Bible every day and pray wow read your Bible every day and pray it is hard to do to do those things because we got so much to occupy that to sit down middle by little see drifting a gradual shift in the attitude the way you're thinking about things the way you thinking you know sometimes we always look across the aisle well they're doing it what I got to do with you come on you can't let what other people do affect how God wants to deal with you you got to understand it's you and God you're not going to get anything because of what but the earnest about the Jeremiah Joshua Simmons do know you're gonna have to know God for yourself because if we decide we ain't gonna go no more what's going to happen to you and a lot of times we see that people rely on what others do but if you are an example follow Jesus Paul said follow me as I follow Christ see we got an example but we take any other example the next church that this preacher that this is here no follow Jesus what did he do come on he was homeless he had nowhere to lay his head now he had a right like everybody else to have a house they have a family they have things but no because he want to be touched by the feeling of our infirmity he was God oh he was guarding flesh yet the things of this world he didn't want to build a castle he could have had but no he was more concerned that I'm your example if you don't have this if you don't have that that's all right just give me Jesus you get everything so nicely here get everything so together here at the servant of God you know we're looking at Billy Graham and Uncle Roberts and he got a little touch sometimes you know the devil trying to anoint you himself why I can't have it and God said look up we're not scribing for things here because this is not our home we're just passing through our screen we're using these things temporarily you know but what we are actually looking for oh my God oh well what are we looking for scrapes of gold come on something you don't have to worry about paying for anymore not even their taxes you don't have to worry about these uh economical things that we so wrapped ourselves into let's see here brother Carol say a lot you say you know it's okay to have good thing but just don't let the good thing get you see the good house the good car the good living you know those things sometimes mean more to us than God does because Robert said where your heart is that's where your treasure see in in our heart there are certain things there and you have to know and sometimes God has to bring it out what could I give you so you don't walk away from me what can I actually substitute I want me to make you more happier as I hear people say I'm so happy you left God and you happy and I said Lord help them you left the presence and the things of God and you are more happier and you can't get mad with them because maybe that's far they could go with it see because whatever is in US God's gonna bring it out and it's gradually that's why we see the great falling away did it just follow it all of a sudden it took years years and then boom Lord have mercy boom people that we looked up to and people that we had a lot of respect for and I'm not saying downcast but Lord have mercy because I don't be I don't be happy because of somebody fall I pray God for mercy on them because that's not our attitude to wish somebody don't make it no I want even my enemy to make it but let me tell you I can't afford to take my eyes off of the prize I can't afford to um go backwards it's too late now server got here was saying here that he said now the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word to cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade in the state of the church be on fire with the fire of God it cooled off and become formal now Lord they still were coming to church they still was singing a song but no it was a form of godliness but denying the power he said this that they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them and they began to be careful about what the world thought of them see and that's how it gives a lot of times pouring out getting more living better doing things I always want to do in my whole life don't even know that thing is sucking you prayer life began to fade we get so loose certain the Bible hand said he said now he said we have he said call it he called them back see God ain't gave up God's solid condition God said repent and do your first works don't stay in that condition because you got an opportunity to do something about your situation you got to do something about it God gave them a space to repent he give us a space to repent closing of another year where are we at where are we really at I just was trying to treat them I seen them what we really need I believe you know every homeless trust said what we really did he said we need a fully surrendered dedication to come back to God again because we all had gotten Slack and any time passed we might have got away with it let me tell you something it gonna take more it gonna take more next year than we did this year but we got to start right now and that's just each individual you got to make us don't worry about what everybody else is doing because sometimes we measure ourselves by others the Bible say that's not wise you want to marry yourself go to the god of word and look in and say Lord here am I you know me Lord I backslid I went back with God but Lord help me show me what I need to do Lord and the first thing he said repent first acknowledge it did cry out as Samson did when Delilah thought she had Samson the devil's going to have sex on whipped momentarily but Samson has something down in his heart that he desire Lord if you give me one more chance he got once more Lord one more time God lord just one more time God give me another opportunity a company you want that kind of chance he realized he failed but he asked God for Mercy I want to say Mercy is here tonight yeah God is still extending mercy upon us but he said you got to come out of this situation and the first thing you do is repent first Lord I'm sorry help me I got sidetracked on this and on that it doesn't matter what it is God just want to want to heal your sincerity desire you know you don't have been home too long many people been out there too long wondering wondering what are you wondering for come back to God I mean that's what God is calling that prodigal said when he went away he realized that he's sitting against God in his father he went back home script broke nothing but he had a father Over Yonder oh Church you got a father Over Yonder on the other Shore and he's calling you tonight come back home you that hear you that listening come on back home it's time to come home now the cold winds are blowing death is striking it's time to come home how about it tonight as we turn over to our pastor God bless you [Applause] song says when the storm of light was raging praise God I thank God for the word tonight how about you so many folks are passing away so many of my classmates and uh people that we grew up with is just passing every week there's two or three passing life is short if you live a little while you realize how short this life is and whatever you're gonna do you can do it for Christ because everything else won't matter after a while you may be young you may be old or whatever as I said the prophet of God said the question is going to be asked one day what did you do with the life that I gave you what did you do with the life that Jesus gave you we spent it all on us we were selfish it's just like the man with the talent I bury it spent it all on me I believe that God wants us to give back what he gave us are you with me God gives you life give you health give you strength he wants you to give it back to him that's the most important thing in life seek ye first a member of Bishop R L Davis the Lord Lord sister singing first time I heard seek seek Him First seek me first and that was it was powerful then seeking me first she sang that song and I just you know love the way she's singing seek me for she could sing it and I believe we need to seek God first nothing else that we do in life all our plans all are nothing else if you don't if we don't have God it ain't gonna mean nothing in your house is a car none of that stuff really God your job your wife your husband whatever the children whatever we need God it's an individual Journey God ain't gonna come and ask you about your wife your uh your children whatever is you and God but if you see God before she said all other things but see he knows that amen he'll give you all that if you seek him first God bless you let us stand we appreciate the word tonight let us just by our heads father in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we know many times even myself find a drifting sometime father look at the people look at
