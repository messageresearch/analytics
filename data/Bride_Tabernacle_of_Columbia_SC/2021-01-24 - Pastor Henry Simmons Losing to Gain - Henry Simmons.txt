god for having another chance may not have this chance anymore amen i think they said i have another chance amen philippians 3 and 7 it says what things were gained to me those account laws for christ yea doubtless i count all things but lost for the ecstasy of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i suffer the loss of all things and do count them but done that i may win christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and in the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable until his death if by any means i might attain until the resurrection of the dead may god bless you read this word you may be seated you know sometimes we look at life and all the things that we have to lose in order to gain christ paul had achieved many great things and probably you know sometimes if we work hard to achieve a certain status and certain academic goals and certain life goals sometimes when it comes down to christ people make decisions sometimes people have attained great riches and they've done many things sometimes folks don't even have nothing but the ideal a thought a concept yet they don't want to lose that which they have for christ but in coming to christ there must you must be willing to lose in order to gain paul realized that he had to come to that fact on the road to the masters he had to come to the reality that what he had he had to give up yes he was very religious and very resilient for the god and yet he had been schooled and trained well sometimes our denominational ideas going to seminary school and learning how to be a good baptist a method it's a a pentecostal or some persuasion even when it comes down to message believers sometimes all we have is theories and concepts sometimes we don't know the person of jesus christ sometimes we were we were reared up in a certain persuasion and because we were raised a certain way we seem to accept that this is the way this is the truth and this is the life but many times we have to come to the place of reality the many things that we think that we have and we're holding on to we have to give it up in order to win christ to lose is the gain let us look at the book of ruth and we know the story a little bit uh roof had went out i mean naomi had went out with her husband and she had lost her two sons and all she had left was her two daughter-in-laws orpha and ruth and she was in such a condition that they had left bethlehem or judea to journey over until the land and after journeying from bethlehem and judah judea marlon and colin died eliminate her husband had died and she realized she'd come to a place that i have no reason to stay over in this foreign land i need to go back home so she went out full and she said she's returning home empty she tried to persuade her daughter-in-law's moab why don't y'all stay over here and serve your gods because i don't have a son or whatever to give you and uh just stay and get your husband and you know you have a life sometimes we make decisions because of circumstances and sometimes all decisions that we make will determine our eternal destiny see this one uh roof here was not just thinking about herself and her life she had something far more that she was envisioned and she was looking at brother and sister i think we look at the moment now and what we're achieving and what we've gotten we spent our time debating and getting all been out of proportion and uh uh sometimes we're not settled down we're not really what we ought to be as christians because we are so tangled up and so mixed up in the worldly affairs amen we cannot get entangled with the world amen we must be willing to give the world up amen because the world amen will have you in bondage but we must be able to forsake the world brother and sister his roof replied when her mother-in-law uh said i i want you to go back and get married or whatever paraphrasing going on you know with your people and serve your gods she said in the 16th verse ruth said and treat me not to leave thee are returned from falling after thee for whether thy gods i will go and whether thy largest i will large thy people shall be my people and thy god my god see she told them go back and serve your gods but she realized that she had a revelation it's something about when you'd have a true revelation of who god is nobody can tell you you can go back to the baptist or to the methodist or some denomination you can go back you know when you got a true revelation who god is that he's the word amen and i just didn't come to the message because it was an ideal because i was raised but i came to the message because it was the word that was a name for the hour that i lived amen i didn't come amen uh to a man i came because i saw that it was god i'm not falling amen ruka said i'm not following you near on me amen but i know they meant that the god you served that's the god that i don't see and i'd rather lose my own uh uh home that i was brought up my own country i lose that i lose everything in my family and everything but i'm going to follow you to gain discard that you're talking about amen you told me about the god and i amen by faith i i've come to realize that there's no other god and there's only one god and i'm going to go after that one brother and sister i'm telling you there are many ideas and there are many amen there are many uh uh thoughts and people said this is the way that's the way but to us today amen there's not there's just one lord one faith and one baptism there's only one way we can get to god and that's through jesus christ and he is the word brother says there's nothing that's there's no use in going on searching for another way that's not another way god has given us the provided way for this day uh are you with me he has provided a way for us for this state that we live in and we know that god provided way amen god has given us a word in season for the hour that we live in amen and it's taking us back to the faith of the apostolic fathers meant back to the word back to the scripture back to god and we know the season in the time that we're living in we see the political system and the formation of the uh of the anti-christ system in the image of the beast as it begins to be formulated amen and we see the the political arena and high set up and we see amen this woman raising up amen over america we see the power which this woman is carrying and we see the vice president and we see the president and we see amen the scope of what we are contending with and we see that they are well positioned themselves to get in place to fulfill what was written of them are you with me praise god and we know if they'll amen if they have uh formulated and they have come to manifestation in the amen that system that uh mystery babylon and the image of the beast if they have come amen in the manifestation then there must be a manifestation of the sons of god that must be somebody amen praise god that has come to full maturity praise god i believe that this amen the wheat must be identified in this hour as the tares are gathered in abundance to be burned are you up man so the wheat amen praise god he said praise god leave him alone at harvest time it'll come a time and i'll send my angels and there'll be a separation brother and sister i believe we'll come to harvest time and i believe that your son is angels to separate are you up man sometimes we marvel why this separation why what's going on god send his angels to do it praise god and i know amen and sometimes we're trying to understand what's going on brother sister brother the straight in the narrow way and there'll be few that find it praise god amen it's the way of jesus christ and he is the word amen praise god you cannot mix some schism and use them out of it amen you cannot add to the word you can't take away from the word it's got to be amen absolute amen every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god oh god we have an absolute brother sister amen we have something amen praise god no matter what the world say about it amen it didn't as i said on friday night uh all of them talked about if you be the son of god come down from the cross amen but he was he he endured the cross despised the shame he knew what kind of authority and what kind of power he had but he didn't use his authority and power to come down from the cross he used his authority and power to stay on the cross and why was he standing there it was because of you and i praise god brother and sister if you suffer something you ought to suffer not for yourself but suffering for oh god those ain't meant to persecute you and despise you and hate you just because you're standing for something you're standing for god amen and you stay there in your position loving them in spite of what they do or say about you forgiving them amen in spite of brother i forgive your sister i forgive you praise god because i don't i know you don't know what you're doing are you with me you don't even know what you're saying praise god hallelujah hallelujah peter said uh you know i lord i never never i never leave you no oversick your lord i die he said get behind me satan because this is not the hour it meant that you say what you're saying because i said oh you're gonna deny me amen praise god before the clock uh strike twice you're going to deny me three times god knows amen peter was going to deny him isn't that right and peter said i'm i'm not going to do it but amen god amen god knew amen what was going to take place the journey that i got to go i got to go by myself brother and sister jesus knew amen that uh uh peter amen you got a swole and you cut a man in off but this is not the time for that i got to go and aim it nobody could do it i got to do it alone hey man who's this amen coming from heathen amen that threaded the wine press alone who's this i see i see he didn't see one that did it and he did it alone he had to go this way alone by himself amen and i'm telling you brother and sister this is the lonely road that you amen that you're going to thread in in these coming days in these coming hours you must amen have your own personal revelation of jesus christ and the road you got to travel it's going to be a lonely road because it's going to amen amen as we near the headstone the top of the pyramid it's going to get narrow praise god amen because we're coming up to the head praise god man it's gonna fall off praise god we'll be climbing jacob's ladder and many ain't gonna won't be able to hold to the they get oh lord the daybreak amen i believe jacob hell on the daybreak amen and he wrestled with the angels till he got his breakthrough and i believe there are many amen that will give up before they get their breakthrough they ain't met there are many amen that's going to turn around on this journey amen but they'll there are those that amen i'll lose everything but i'm going to win so no matter what amen the only said roof was determined oh you would be i am the terror man no matter what you say you're not gonna stop me from following you are you with me she said things that it sounded good it was all right but you're not gonna stop me from falling you because i know you don't told me about god now you know you know sometimes we think we just following somebody but it must have this woman this woman knee on me that it lost everything but yet she must have had something that was amen that meant more to her than a husband than a son and amen she must have embraced this god in such a way amen that roof amen she saw something about the old me and the omens gone in her relationship with god amen you know somebody ought to see something even your relationship amen amen that doesn't matter how stormy it gets it doesn't matter how much trouble comes in your life it doesn't matter how many things happen to you but your god is still god and it's real praise god and she knew that there was a people i'm out here in the in a place where people don't know my god but i'm still holding on to my god amen praise god sometimes we'll venture out ain't been in a place where people don't know your god amen just because uh for a better job a better situation a better economical status because things ain't going too good amen in my jobs amen and i i need to provide for my family but even eliminated know that my journey away from god i'm losing everything because i'm trying to gain something in this life but i've lost my life i lost everything are you with me our journey away from the presence of our homeland the place where god said i bless you amen there came a famine in that land of bethlehem of judea and because of the fame and the hardship there it caused many to leave home i'ma tell you something sometimes fame and time come things ain't always going to be amen praise god well look like you're just blessing the amen and everything is going swell and well sometimes famine come in our lives and sometimes things ain't going good sometimes people looking at what they see not what they don't see amen you got to look at the word and look at the promise look at what god said i'm going to stay in my homeland i'm going to stay in the word i'm not going to journey in some denominational systems amen praise god for prosperity maybe they said well i'll give you a paycheck maybe they said amen i pay you to play music maybe they say i'll pay you to sing on the choir maybe they say i'll do this and i'll do that amen but you got a amen of revelation amen praise god i'm not preaching for your money praise god i'm not singing for your money i'm not playing for your money praise god right amen i've been sold out to god praise god i i i got a court that i'm standing for oh yes i'm gonna tell you something i believe in the midst of all the adversities she held on to god's unchanging hand losing the game let me just reflect again at hebrews 12 here because i like to read it and just remind us again why again why again because the decision that people make sometimes cause you to reflect back and to re-evaluate when you're praying through and you know i i was looking at investment and and what the prophet was saying about investment and i was really realizing that people invest in he said make sure it's something that's solid that you invest in not a fly-by-day company make sure it's established company if you're going to invest in it some people will put their whole life saving in some fly by night something that just come up and then put all their life saving into invest in some quick rich scheme and they find out they lost everything amen he said but don't follow out that he said go and do your research and see whether or not this company is stable and see how long it's been standing and when you make an investment amen amen you got to seek out that you're making a good investment and we weren't in this life here we make certain choices choice uh he meant to go to school or not to go to school the the choice to get a trade a trusted live in a certain neighborhood to live in a certain standard we invest in certain things but the decision that we make amen the gain that we're getting out of certain situations we got to know amen is this the will of god for our lives this is the will of god for my family it's just the will of god sometimes we can uh make the wrong decisions because amen we we're investing we have we got to count the cause are you with me so the prophet god said make me make good investments amen that you can get dividend in amen that you got something that's standing amen so by the grace of god he said not many of those get rich quick schemes he said many of them really work are you with me so here moses you know you've seen those preachers that are excited and work you all up and dust set the lord this is going to happen not going to happen like all of them did uh president trump and trump is going to be president again all those prophets it's almost like hannah nyaya makaya said if he is then i the lord didn't speak to me are you a man but all of them you know the youtube preachers prophets yeah yeah the lord said lord say look at him are you a man speaking in the name of the lord and the lord saying the lord saying anytime you i'm gonna tell you something when you hear a person say that god said listen god say that and god said i run for your life everything god said god told me this and god told me that run for your life just get it you run run for that church run for that preacher where every time he turned around god said listen god said that and the lord told me this and that person amen the lord told me that's the lord told me that religious hypocrites run from that person can't even be open their mouth listen they say the lord say run for your life people that try to be spiritual anytime a person being super spiritual run from your life and i tell you when people say uh you know when you see freedom say pray lord hallelujah i want to borrow a thousand dollars lord jesus pray to the lord the lord told me to talk to you with somebody see you understand what up you ain't gonna get your money back because they all super spiritual but a person say i'm struggling a little brother i need if you got it if you know i understand if you don't you know if you can use can i borrow and so and so on i'll try to do the best i can to pay you by you said okay brother i realized you struck me no don't mind leaning and if you didn't get it back you locked that spirit are you with me but the one that said well no no no no no all that talking ain't gonna make you ain't gonna make you pay it back or not are you with me so brother and sister i'm telling you amen counted all laws to gain amen sometimes amen we hold on to stuff that we need to let go amen holding on to some i'm a hold on to this to taking me in the hole sometimes we hold on to things that's keeping us bound up and taking us down we hold on to something somebody said that somebody said that somebody said oh i can't trust this person because i know it right because they said it and i know the lord with this person let it go you know god told me god told me to say that i know i've seen another vision god didn't show you in the vision to forgive him what god told me what good is it going to do for you well i know uh it ain't gonna do you a bit of good to hold the grudge and hold something oh that nothing is the devil oh is the devil oh lord sometimes you got to say to the devil i forgive you then the bible says judas friend betrayed me with a kiss and then the bible said satan haven't entered into judah says carrier simon's son isn't that right so he it actually wasn't a demon in him with the devil in him but jesus was saying friend see jesus was able to forgive his archenemy are you with me and yet we ain't able to forgive somebody that we thought that we thought say something about us lord heaven i said god i wish the people would grow up and get some real spiritual fortitude and real christian character amen if people don't soon grow up they'll lose their soul trying to be spiritual sometimes we get too spiritual and and lose god but we know we ought to be able to lose ourselves that we might gain christ the love of god amen in this age we must come to the headstone amen we got to come to the top of the pyramid we just can't just go around all my i love it i got i know i love everybody nobody can tell me i don't love come on once you're boasting and bragging about you know you got love you know something that is on display you don't have to talk about your love for brother sister amen you don't have to uh you don't have to define your love and prove it to nobody if you got the love of god just go on live just live just live amen people amen uh when you got the love of god in you people just flow to you when people want to stay away from you and you want to stay away from people love is easy to be entreated are you a man amen love is not running from people it's running two people oh you would be any time for running they gotta run like you're the double i'm around you i don't want to get rid of you because you're contagious love is stronger even than death are you with me brother and sister don't let nothing cause you to have a little funny feeling about one another love one another in spite get rid of the find a feeling get out of here what are you doing then you don't belong here amen the prophet of god says christ the mystery of god reveal the word to the church when he was talking about pausing in the church he said the satan if there's nobody in here like that he says satan will send somebody in and shoot some poison in them and have a little funny feeling he'll spread that thing throughout the whole church he said that what the devil would do isn't that right and that's what i pausing in the church paul's in the get everybody mind on something that ain't even true but satan will inject that and shoot that pause and and spread it all over everybody amen because if it was right and it was from the law you'll go and get that situation strained out isn't that right you'll go straight to that brother that sister and get it straightened out in there but that's the way the law works not spread pausing throughout the church isn't that right telling everybody but the person that are you with me so brothers and sisters watch it watch it word to the church go back and look at it let's let's look at um 23 11 and 23. yo y'all feel all right this morning this ain't preaching just talking to you a little bit god is good isn't that right he said by faith when he was born he was heared three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandments by faith moses when he was coming years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter i'm going to tell you something moses got in a place where he had all the game but he refused it brothers and sisters sometimes what looks like a blessing could be a curse that's why i said moses had something inside of him to make the decision that he made you know it took god for most most of us all the love don't let me hear you no hallelujah i know god is good brothers and sisters sometimes some blessings didn't come from god and then god can use even your enemy to bless you for a season only to the time that he's appointed and i believe it came a time that god had appointed time to open moses eyes and let him see and moses had to make a decision from that time from that time are you with me you and i get to a place where god put us in a place where we have to make decisions okay he says choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of god can you see i'll step out the king palace and i'll go with these slaves these people that's in barnes these mud dobblers i'm gonna go down until the people of lois state some of us amen suppose we uh we were you know multi-millionaires and we going to the ghetto and you're going to be identified with those that are in the ghetto that can't hardly pay them rent are you with me i'm gonna leave my sometimes god has to bring us down and he have to tell us to give it up always like the young rich ruler he may you know he he he had god said you know good master what my side dude he heard eternal life he said sell everything you have because brothers and sisters sometimes god asks us to make decisions that we don't really want to obey but in order to gain eternal life he had to sell all that he has but he wasn't willing to make that brother sacrifice sister some sacrifices we must be willing to make you know if i make this decision abraham if i made the decision that means where i was real and all this that i've gained over in china the canadians but i got to leave and go to some place you ain't telling me where i'm going but you say to come and abraham come out he called abraham out from his kinfolk out from his country and going somewhere i don't even know where i'm going but like god spoke see it got to be gone brother and sister god don't have to explain to you he meant when he saved you and he called you he amen to call you by his grace he don't have to explain to you amen all he said come on and follow me amen the disciples saying to jesus master where you're going he said i'm going to tell you where i'm going have holes birds of the air have nests but the son of man don't have nowhere to lay his head come on you still want to go come on follow me brother and sister i'm telling you god asks you to make decisions not for the advantages of things that you see but god has an eternal plan for your life and an eternal destination are you with me praise god you got to know it's god you got to know it's god speaking to your heart and god's speaking to your situation and god that knows all about amen all you've been through all you're going through god knows that oh oh the lord will show you everything but the right thing amen the devil will hold you all bind up and amen all twitch it up amen the devil won't let you love like you ought to love amen the devil won't give you peace he have you always confusing not knowing how to make a sound decision god is not the author of so i said well i'm confused i don't know what to do god and not the authors get it come from god are you a man when god speaks to you amen it might hurt you but it's gonna be the truth amen it might not be what you want but it's what god want are you with me so he says choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of god then enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season let me tell you something some people make the wrong decision some people think i can put god on the back burner and i tell god to wait till i'm ready god when i get ready to serve you i'll let you know woo the prophet god said if there is a desire in you for god and you know that there's a hunger and there's a desire in you to serve him he said you need to take advantage of that desire because one day you'll wake up and that desire won't be there anymore are you with me if you have a desire to serve the lord and to live for the lord then god has given you that desire but what happens if you do not take advantage of that desire he said god will take that desire away from you don't let god take that desire away from you if you ever deserve that that's god to put that desire in you to serve him and you have that desire to serve him take advantage of that desire lord i serve you lord i want to serve you lord i do oh okay many people don't even have a desire to serve the lord hey do you want to ah not ain't no no desire but if you have that desire take advantage of that desire are you with me he says esteeming the reproach of christ the pledge of the sin foresees sometimes you have tears in your eyes crying for your loved ones that makes their own choice and you cry with tears in your eyes because they you know they're making the wrong choice and you know that that their choice they take them down some dog roads and some perilous and dangerous times in their life and you're crying why because you don't want to see them go through what they got to go through for the decision that they made oh lord if there's a desire somewhere in our hearts if you're listening not there if that's the desire to serve the lord amen one day god might take that desire away you that are here that amen desiring amen to serve the lord but yet you're not going all the way you know you're holding back on god i'd say amen fulfill the desire there's something god wants you to do amen that god has a purpose and a plan for your life but you're holding back on god because god can no he can move that away from you what is the preach what is the saying what is the plan instrument whatever desire god has put in your heart i want you to know that one day god can move it but probably god said that it just just anchored down inside of me because i desire to do a lot of things amen and i said lord please don't take those desires away it's things and people that i want to reach people that i want to share this message with things that i want to do as the lord don't take that desire away from me let me fulfill that let me just go to those individuals let me tell them about this more perfect way god planned for us see he said esteeming the reproach of christ greater what greater riches than he said greatest riches where your tragedy is that will your heart be also you know right praise god i'd rather lose all my worldly treasures amen and to do something for the lord brother put god first to do something for jesus first amen praise god i know you said i got to work tell you about my family let me do something for god do something that yo if i can do something for the law because everything that i gained in this life is going i lose it amen but i'll lose i'd rather lose everything and gain christ greater riches see how rich just think how rich pharaoh was and all the riches the riches of the billionaires of this earth it was no comparison to the riches that pharaoh had pharaoh the richest man in the whole world and just just think the kind of style the way it could set and some folks are for a few million dollars give up on god some folk for a few thousand dollars would give god up but look what moses pursued esteem in the reproach he knew he had to go through something the bible said the reproach of christ was moses back then christ stayed in jesus christ but jesus said i am that i am the reproach of christ you know you got to go through something brothers
