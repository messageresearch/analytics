chapter again we thank him for tuning in and thank you for coming this morning amen think we need revival as we talked this morning time to unite it's time to unite different things that happens in life and when different things happen it's a call for unity and we've seen that the nation in the country in the world needs to be unified somebody said where there's unity there is strength Jesus declared when two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be in the mists x2 and one says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place something that came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and to fill all the house where they were sitting if we unite something will happen and there appeared and then there my clothes and turns like of the fire and it's set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost that's what we need we need a feeling of the Holy Ghost and a refueling and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that they that every man heard them speak in his own language hallelujah and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold about all these which speak galilaeans and how hear we every man in our own way which way and we were born parthians and medes and elamites and dwellers in mesopotamia and injured and in cappadocia and in ponents in an angel and Phrygia and Pamphylia in Egypt and in the parts of Libya and serene and strangers of Rome Jews and pasta lights Crete's and Arabians we do hear them speak and I'll tongue the wonderful works of God how amazing regard bless the reading of his word in Jesus name you may be seated if you were standing so by the grace of God we want to talk to you today about time to unit to unite it's time to unite and to return it's time to unite and return there was a Pentecostal feasts that disjunction of time and now God had told Jesus had told his disciples after his resurrection that I want you to go to Jerusalem and I want you to tear it in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high go there an expectation I want you he meant to go amen looking for the promise for he had said on some occasions that he meant I I'm going away in it but I'm gonna come back again amen and I'm gonna receive you unto myself not only he said that even a little while in the world won't see me no more yet a little while and you see me in it because even I in it that's dwelling with you I shall be in you I'm coming back they meant to receive you I'm coming back to let you know when I come back no I'll be with you always even unto the end into the world I'm gonna be with you and I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you then come and meet me in Jerusalem meet me in Jerusalem under anticipation in expectation even that what I promised you in that God is going to perform his promises I said it is time to unite it's time to return let me finish reading here in acts 2 and 12 it says 11 he said they would greet Crete's and Arabians we do hear them speaking out tongues the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and word out saying one to another what meaneth this others mark and Sandy's men are full of new wine amen I said give me some of this wine I believe we need some of this wine that will cause us to like the end they meant it calls us to enter into the supernatural realm but you must come Oh wanna cause even you got to get in one place and be I want to go and then gone said I'll meet you in there it's a please where God wants to meet you and I want you to find God it sucked and provided please that God wants to meet you baby in your place but God wants to meet with man that please we can be United even though they were partying Medes and Elamites and dwellers in Mesopotamia and they were Jews devout men out of every nation I said the church need to come to God provided please and meet them I heard Apostle Paul's said I would that you were one mind and one Accord and there be no division among God wants to take away all division he's calling you now to unite soul knew why he meant he said be not drunk with wine but rather I I would rather you be filled with the spirit he meant nothing wrong with the Spirit of God Ashima dull when Carmen is not hungry touch him for the Living God we need the Spirit of God but in order to receive the Holy Ghost that's new why you got to get in God provided please make me make me in Jerusalem make me Jerusalem him he said 14 for sure but Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you man up to dare and all you to dwell at Jerusalem be this known and the youth and hearken to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel that it should come to pass that in the last days said god I will pour my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions your old men shall dream dreams and all my servant and on my handmaid I will pour in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy amen God even promised that he'll pour out his spirit and God did exactly what he promised he will feel exactly what he said he said I'll do it and God did exactly what he said but when God pulled out his spirit there were many men thought that this was just a host that these men painted what's just jumped II don't it was a natural happening they did not realize the spirits are significant of what was going on the natural man conscious that there is a call for a spiritual United signs and time that God is doing something Wow he met the natural world I fell trying to unite and become one he been there's a spiritual Kingdom that God is calling back to return to Jerusalem to return even to the please Wow two days I've said it's time to return in the Book of Kings first Kings 18 first Kings 18 God is a merciful God and God is a great God and God wants to bless us first Kings 18 and 36 I want you to remind you of the story of Elijah they meant hills were had drifted so far away from God and then they're drifting away from God they had worn down that random nation king he had and he had a wife he meant that wasn't a believer and her name was Jezebel and at that time Jezebel he had caused the people to be seduced and steerer amanda was him in gone to she led the nation into our dollars here to worship bale and began to amen to have false worship People of God they is even on Sanibel spirit that have pretend to the church and has seduced imagination and I seduced the church and still a washer in the true and living God then they began to worship in a bale I want you to be conscious in a way just because you go to church that don't mean that you worship in God just because you say I'm a Christian that doesn't mean a mana no folks that say they were Jews the Bible said that they were not the synagogue of Satan I want you to know the people that's all to unite no union is not with the world God is calling you to unite is with the world 36 there was a mark almost showdown where the true believers what's going to be identified Amen I wish today that we recognize God is calling you and I to return not to the church because a lot of people come back to the church and said I'm coming home coming back to where grandma was coming back your granddaddy they come to the physical building in it but we're grandmama hard was and how my mama lived and hardware mama walked they remember the church and they remember the building but they don't remember from Mama's press grandmom prayed harder to God the sacrificing this should be they remember problem they remember mothers but they don't remember the life that my believe they don't remember the life I said it's time not return to the church or to the building or to some denomination it's time to come back to Jerusalem not to resume the land of Palestine not to Teresa over there praise God as a nation that we're talking about but I'm talking about two heavenly Jerusalem I'm talking about the spirits of Jerusalem it's time to return back to that needs the place where God promised that I'll meet today I'll meet you in Jerusalem time to return but Israel at the time was call to remembrance what you think you are and who you take your washing I will choose to be open People of God I want a challenge Jezebel prophets but ones that eat at Jezebel's evil Elijah came down to are you believing such a bell is leaning your eyes are you to believe that antenna bel religion I will call you oh I want you to meet me ma coma and I want you to make a sacrifice turn yoga under guard and answer by fire let me go go ahead I'll let you go first and they offered sacrifice they build the altar under cold upon bail but there was no answer I'm saying brother sister if you're not gonna answer down if you're playing and you're crying out to God and God is not answered I said something in wrong in your life look oldest even God not to respond until you cry if God is not responded then I want you to look and examine yourself and see whether you be in the faith or not examine yourself human dancin you've been shot in you've been taken but there is no power in your worship does no the leverage in your worship you still living in like the world you still acted like the world you're still rested like the world there's no change in your life please be that you're not worshipping the true and living God amen are you doing the choir might saying good the preacher might preach eloquent but where is gone a sudden let us return first Kings 1836 and it came to pass at the time I said it's time to unite at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice I believe that there shall be light in the end of time I believe the scene the time I believe that God promised that the Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings I believe is even the time and I believe right there's no sign a star spring from her but God won't deliver his people and I believe that somebody needs to leverage somebody needs healing somebody needs that tree in their lives they made a time to return and Elijah it even is sacrificing larger the Prophet came then said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and even her eyes and in Israel let it be known this day that thou our God in Israel saying I know the Sun is hot they meant we are come from distances to be here but let us come for something let us not just come set in the Sun in the heat of the day let us come with an expectation that God can deliver on his promise let us come and let the Steep be a differently they meant let us say he meant that a toonie I'm not tuning in just to hear another sermon I'm not tuning in just to hear some elegant words but I want to hear from God and I want to know that this God routine he means me that God calls my heart to burn me that God speak to my knees may die God with me I trust this morning that's you that are here you that often listed might receive satin that will shake ever devolution God that every demon that's not hold of you - amen Osama should not come against Baylor would I come

Christian challenge is yours brother sister and friend he said I am your servant you know I think we prayed that God would not answer us because our life there's not in order we've been going through
