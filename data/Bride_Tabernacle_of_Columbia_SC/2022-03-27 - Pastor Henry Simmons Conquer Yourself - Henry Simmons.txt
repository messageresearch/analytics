oh god to expound upon it oh god that you would be well pleased in jesus christ's name we pray amen ephesians 5 and 20 through 33 i'll read the first you read the next and we read the latter verse together amen god is a good god amen worthy to be praised amen we come here because we love him amen and amen and loving him we love one another amen he says giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ 21. why submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the lord twenty-three therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let wives be to their own husband and everything twenty-five that he might sanctified and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word twenty-seven sought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loves his wife loveth himself 29. for we are members of his body and his flesh and of his bones a man thirty-one his father and mother and shall be joined jesus shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church together nevertheless let every one of you in particular and so love his wife even as himself and why i see that she reverence her husband may god bless the readers towards you may be seated so by the grace of god that we want to talk to you tonight i mean this morning conquer yourself as a continuation from last week um humble yourself and hopefully you'll see that we'll just continue that same subject but the subject this morning is conquering yours to conquer yourself amen praise god and how can i conquer myself how can we conquer oneself to conquer oneself is to submit yourselves to christ are you with me to conquer yourself is to submit yourself to christ and that's why we're already fijian there to conquer yourself is to submit yourself to christ amen and to humble yourself before him that's really power amen if you want power that's where the power lies with humility and humbling in yourself so if you want real power the real power comes in humbling yourself it's humility amen so we'll go back to peter just a reminder of what we read last sunday first period of five and five it says likewise you're younger we're talking about conquering yourself you know some people let self conquer them instead of conquering themselves sometimes we're conquered by ourselves are you with me so instead of letting self conquer you you conquered yourself are you with me see because as we were at the spirit of uh of the last days is the spirit of lucifer where it won't set glory but in we're not going to allow flesh to get glory we're not going to allow self to be glorified or magnified in god's house satan wanted lucifer wanted to exalt himself isn't that right so we uh we are opposite we're going to conquer he wants to exalt himself and exalt himself above the stars of god isn't that right so as we learned last week how lucifer wanted to exalt himself he meant so amen this flesh won't exalt itself the flesh amen wants to lift itself up and think with something in our flesh amen the your flesh uh uh uh are trying to rule you it'll it'll try to conquer you amen but you you got to deny this flesh you got to deny yourself are you up man you in order to conquer yourself you got to deny it amen when your flesh says i'm weak i mean i'm strong you got to realize it's not by my might not by my power but it's by the spirit of the lord without jesus i can do nothing without him i can do nothing so you got to you got to learn how to defeat yourself you got to learn how to wrestle against his flesh amen fight against his flesh the bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but it's a spirit behind the flesh that we're rising against that's the spirit of lucifer that's the spirit amen they're trying to bring you bring this body into subjection to that spirit he meant the walls against god for paul said when i desire to do good evil is present with me amen i find then a wall going on in my mind i want to do right but there is that my that war that's going on amen so we got to realize that that as a wall it's it's a spirit behind your flesh amen that that you got to wrestle against it's it's it's a demon power that's trying to influence you to trust in yourself and to trust in your flesh amen and to lift your flesh up amen instead of seeing the spirit behind you see yourself but you don't see that there's a spirit that's taking control to exalt you amen are you with me to lift you up because he knows if amen if you if he gets you to look at yourself and lift yourself up praise god he got he conquers you that spirit becomes your god and that spirit becomes amen your headship that spirit becomes your husband you become married to a spirit amen instead of resisting amen the devil you actually submit yourself to the devil and you instead of doing the will of god you're doing the will of the spirit that conquers you and that is a spirit amen that walls against god amen we don't amen we don't want that spirit amen of this flesh to conquer you so you got to conquer oneself you got to conquer yourselves are you with me so just to remind you of last week we coming mike i was excited and stirred and they're mullings on thursday we'll be coming back here this morning five and five likewise you're young what i said how can i conquer myself okay by submitting yours to christ are you with me and you know christ is the word so you got to admit to christ and he is the word isn't that right so submit yourself to the word of god are you with me because you know why submit yourself to your what not to somebody else's husband to your what so each and every one of us should be married to christ are you with me and jesus christ is the word but the bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and that was jesus christ isn't it right so you want to christ is the head of the church and you submit yourself to your own husband you being the bride of jesus christ and the wife of jesus christ submit yourself to your what your own husband and he is the word amen so submit yourself amen to christ who is the word are you up there i hope you're with me amen because it's very important that we understand submission and subjection amen because you got to do it not by constraints but willingly not because somebody making you do it amen not because christ is demanding you to do it amen because it's got to be a willingness oh uh you know it it's it's difficult to be married with somebody who's going to demand you that means you in prison and somebody that's making you amen marriage should be a union even a love affair or you will not i i i i i i i am your head and you do what i say because i shall rule over you christ ruling amen is by your submission are you with me his ruling the church is not by amen force amen and not by demand but by your submission your willingness to submit and to humble what yes you got to conquer yourself or you will be and and let him have had ship over the body which is the church because christ is the head of the church the body are you what man so he says likewise ye younger amen submit yourselves to the what we went over that last week but i'm going to read it anyway yay all of you be what and and and that should be a flow within the body of christ that we're knitted together in love and that means we're all subject one to another amen and not not somebody that's i'm way up here and you went on we're subject one to another we are one in christ by one spirit are we baptized into one body praise god the hand ought to not say because uh i i i'm not the defeat i have no need of you we have need one of another amen the body is one member are you with me many members in one body excuse me okay we're one okay says all of you be serving one to another and be clothed with what that's what i'm saying he says to be closed with humility and and in revelation and when we talked about he said uh i consider you to buy me gold tried in the fire amen and then he says i want you to uh be clothed that the shame of your nakedness does not appear amen so he he says be closed with what if it's ever been a time when people are not humble it's our day and i said god spoke to me concerning you know i need to improvement i need to be more humble are you with me and i think we all can use some improvement some more humility being more humble in amen trying to understand one another trying to amen uh work together in love and amen be more submissive one to another amen be more willing to uh you know in other words even when somebody do you wrong you you still love them you you humble yourself you forgive them amen that's uh that's all in love amen humility not trying to get back for god what resistance the problem give it grace to the what humble yourselves therefore under the what mighty hand of god that he may what exalt you in due time you know god wants to lift you up amen the devil wants to oh lord he says cast all your what for he what don't let any devil talk you out of this god wants you to cast everything every carriage you got upon him because he was now the devil will lie to you and tell you that god don't care about you the bible says i mean what god's just saying here he cares for you but in order for you to receive amen god amen caring for you you're gonna have to what humble yourself you've got to conquer itself but you got to get rid of your own thoughts and ideas about it and you got to accept what god says about it praise god to listen to god's word and submit to that word amen it means that i got to look at my pride and look at what i'm exalting over the word even if i'm if i want what god don't want me to have if i'm trying to amen in my imaginations of what i want amen and and and then we want god's mercy and god's grace on our lives we want god the blessings on our lives we want things to get better amen and we want the best of life amen but we do not want to humble ourselves you know amen we got to amen be willing amen to let's deny oneself amen and and to take up your cross and follow him amen it takes humility it takes somebody that's willing to lose amen in order to gain amen i got to give up something i got to give up this world give up my desires and let his desires amen they please him amen praise god amen the the wife ought to seek to please her husband not herself amen are you with me and likewise we ought to seek to please christ and not ourselves are you a man but we got to conquer oneself by reversing it amen to stop the things that we give to the flesh we need to be amen giving it to god amen praise god we want to get we want to give the flesh and let the flesh have preeminence over us and let's self what we got to conquer self amen we got to deny ourselves we got to let this flesh come under subjection to the word amen we got to say amen i'm not going to let you rule over me amen the bible said all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life these things denied of the father but of the world well amen we got to deny amen praise god all these spirits amen that comes up against us we got to deny them we got to amen lose ourselves amen that we might win christ amen we got to come oh hallelujah things got to change amen hallelujah check somebody's hand tell them things got to change amen praise god we got to go we got to win christ praise god this this this flesh try to take over if we let it but we're not going to let this flesh win amen we got to win christ and we got to submit ourselves to him are you so he says here resistance is the pride to give the grace to the humble yourself therefore under the what by the hand of god that he may what exalt you in due time catch all your kids upon him for cares for you be sober revealing it because your adversary the devil is the wrong line walking about seeking to him he may devour amen now if you don't do what god says you know the wrong line got you are you with me if you don't do if you don't walk in humility and do what god says then the roaring lion go to what the devil will devour you if you don't submit yourself to god are you with me so the devil is waiting for his opportunity to devour you you don't think he'll do it you think he's going to treat you well what the bible says amen he's walking through a florida wrong line seeking whom he may devour you the devil uh uh i mean he'll get he'll get you out there but he his purpose is i'm going to devour you amen the devil don't love you the devil hates you amen if you're a son or daughter god amen the devil hate the light he don't want the light they met the bible say you don't walk in the lightest he's in the light amen the devil don't like a christian and somebody that loved god a child of god if you want to be a child of god and you haven't bound the devil don't want you to go to heaven because he's been cast out are you with me so the devil don't love you the devil wants to make believe that he loves you until he gets you and then he'll oh hallelujah then he'll make your drug out again he'll make you he meant praise god he'll make you amen uh subject to all kind of afflictions and bondage and amen he'll give you a marriage that's no good he'll give you a children out of wedlock he'll do all kind of stuff to you amen he'll have your misery amen what the devil amen but he'll trap you he'll get you out there and then he'll let you in oh lord he'll get you there and then he'll [Music] when you're miserable then you're crying i wish i would have just amen staying under the umbrella stayed in the word i wish i would have i know what eve could think i wish i would have never believed satan lie i wish i'd never listen to the devil but she did amen and many times in our lives we wash amen oh god that we wouldn't have made the bad decisions that we made amen we desire to do the right thing but sometimes evil was present with us and we yield to temptation and the bible told us not to yield to temptation amen and we went on and yielding went on after the things to please the flesh instead of pleasing god we went on after that and then we find out amen that the devil got to see man and he's devouring us and he's amen really amen praise god got us in a tough situation and a life of misery a life of shame and amen and desire to please god but we didn't do to make the right choices brother and sister it's time for us to turn it around it's time to repent and come back to god it's time to say god i'm sorry i want to please you lord i want to make a amen i want to make a turn around god i want to come to the word lord i want you to have preeminence lord i want you to be the head i want you to rule over me hallelujah praise god he says the whole resist as a royal line seeking whom he made about whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the god of all grace who has called us into eternal glory by christ jesus after you have what i'm going to tell you something it doesn't no suffering of this present time seemed to be glorious you go through certain things it don't seem to be glorious you know lord i i don't understand what i mean why this had to happen to me what is why this had to happen in my life it's children that are struggling amen because of the things that are contaminating their mind and what they're going through even amen by looking at family conditions and different things that around them and they want to know why i got to go through this why is the life amen uh why i got to deal with this so why can't i have the norm amen why can't and you know many people that are having the norm they they're not pleased with that they're trying to get away from that because they want what amen they want the struggles and and the things that are out there that are those temptations that look good those temptations that feel good they don't know the end that they're after the effects of of the choices that you make the things amen that takes you there amen it'll bring you into bondage amen praise god those things are destroyed you amen it'll destroy the soul it'll it'll it it'll bring you into some dark places and some places amen that you would not want to go wait a minute but because amen a lack of conquering yourself and submitting yourself to christ amen things are happening in life because amen you didn't know and you thought that amen the devil make you think and trust in yourself amen believe that somehow amen i'm gonna control my situation somewhy how it meant that i'm gonna be in control of my life somehow i'm not gonna go even where others have went and then look at their condition look at their lives they may never mean not me amen i'm strong-minded i'm not them the devil is not gonna do me like that amen i'm not gonna go that direction amen many people thought just like you thought and they still think like that amen then i'm gonna make it amen sometimes mama didn't make it or daddy didn't make it sister didn't make it a brother didn't make it but i'm gonna make it things gonna be better for me i remember the devil knowing amen he's got a trap set before you you can't go down that crooked way and be straight you can't go down ain't met the dark path amen and think something's gonna happen good for you the devil got evil waiting at them he's got something really he got a trap set for you once you get down the road a little farther you you're trapped amen and you can't get yourself out of it it's going to take somebody else praying send it in the gap for you because you can't get out of it now amen because you made the wrong decision [Music] amen your prayers are amen they come up before god and like brass amen it's like something is blocking you amen you can't get a prayer through anymore amen you can't even you look up and say god have mercy how did i get in this condition because you trust it instead of conquering the flesh conquering yourself you let self control you you let your evil desires that instead of submitting to christ the word you submitted to your own desires you can instead of conquering self you committed to your own desires amen but there's a time that we god gives us space to repent and to come back to god in such a humble way amen and when we come back to god god will take that which the devil meant for bad and he'll work it to your good god will work things out and amen he straightened out all the mess we've got our lives in the things the wrong turns that we turn but when we repent and say god i'm sorry god has straightened it back out and god give us peace and give us joy and give us amen let us he's he's he's still his hand is stretched out let me just turn from peter for a minute um you know he said after yourself in a while he makes you perfect god want to make you perfect amen but your perfection come through suffering god the captain of our salvation made perfect through suffering so you have to go through some things brother sister don't try to bypass it just say lord if if i have to suffer some things for christ's sake let me suffer for christ and not for my own desires and doing things in my own way then i know i got to suffer for that but i want to suffer for christ because that's where you perfected me amen when people speak evil against you do you wrong get all that that's for your perfection that's when you're going through and you know you're doing right you know god is perfecting you god is bringing you closer to him you you can see christ in your life then he meant before amen somebody do your own you want to fight amen you you're going to talk bad about them they talking bad about you you're going to get back at them no no no now amen you're not walking and trusting in your own flesh you say well i i fight i beat them you know i can i can fight see that you trusting in your own ability amen you're trying to amen trust in your flesh amen but you got to conquer what those those desires that i can fight i can see you trusting in your flesh amen we don't rise against flesh and blood well we're asking against spiritual wickedness in high places it's a spirit behind what folks do amen and you're trying to look at that that individual but it's a spirit behind what they do amen so you'll you you're actually dealing with spirits amen and it's not with that flesh that you're fighting so you got to love that individual but you got to come against that spirit how do i come against that spirit how do i overcome those spirits the bible says humble yourself amen not not he didn't access that other that spirit humble itself he said humble yourself then he says here in the second quran 7 14 if my people they were to call by my name well what humble themselves and pray and seek mama face amen and then turn from their wicked ways he said then well i what i hear from heaven and i what i forg i forgive the sins and i would heal the land are you with me god will forgive you and heal the land but it takes humility amen isaiah um 57 i think that is let me try to get there i just kind of remembered it hopefully there's so many places dealing with humility um isaiah 57 oh goodness let me see can i find it 57 and 15 57 and 15. it says just say the high and lofty one that inhabits what that inhabited eternity whose name is what i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a what contrite and what see god will dwell with you if you want to run christ away from you just you know just be lifted up just have an arrogant spirit a lifted up spirit but if you want christ to remain with you just be what that's where god will dwell with the humble you know well i let nobody take advantage of me come on sister you know you gonna have to let people take advantage they took advantage of christ i i just tell you what i'm gonna do nothing because i i i you know no no no be humble be humble but you're going to be used abused and accused are you with me but you got to stay humble and say lord it's in your hand father it's in your hand you see but all things are in your hand lord you know you understand my pain you understand my hurt you've been through it yourself so i know you're well acquainted and you're touched by the feeling of our infirmities so lord i give it to you i cast all my calves upon you because i know you care are you what man so god wants he is there reaching out to you amen and wants to buy your burdens he wants to do it but you got to humble what long as you trying to handle it god can't handle it because you got to get out the way amen and let god does do the work for you and your life and your home and your family or whatever praise god god want to work for you whatever you're going through whatever trouble whatever problem let god handle it praise god so he says he says the contrite uh and the humble spirit amen to revive the spirit of the what humble are you with me of the humble you we want god to revive us but it is conquering yourself you got to see what am i humble i said to me it's room for improvement god you're still working on me and there's a room for improvement see if we want god to dwell with us we want god to bless us we want god to bless our homes and bless our children bless our marriages bless our the different things we want god to do but where's our humility where where do we stand with god amen let's examine ourselves and let's see how we conduct our lives amen can we stand some more improvement can god still minister to us as individuals can we say god amen i've submitted myself completely and totally to you and to your word and lord i whatever amen your will is lord let it be done in my life and lord oh god i've made some bad decisions i don't know about you are you what man and i'm still amen uh i still battle certain things and i still fight every day amen that's why paul said i die daily there's still some of me to get in the way amen of god sometimes there's still some of me ain't meant to rise up you know i caught myself i i i i i had a i said something to my wife and i said oh i will come under conviction quick because i knew i talked to the wrong tone it wasn't what i said it was the tone that i set it in and i know it hurted her because i said it in the wrong tone and it hurt me because i did it because i know i heard her it hurt me so immediately i said honey i'm sorry forgive me i know that was wrong because it came right back at me see what i'm saying what you know you you you're preaching on humility and harmonies and then the devil just got you didn't i he probably just laughed you say oh did i get you i see i i i and that's what the devil does he wants us amen to hear the word and but not to operate on it oh you look man yeah he don't mind you amen listening but he don't want you to operate amen and sometimes we're so proud of ourselves to amen god can't get the glory out of amen god does great things and he uses us in great ways but we get so proud and lifted up and what god has done in our lives the things that god has afforded us and gave to us amen sometimes amen the way we treat god like god didn't give it to you you think your own hands you work for that i leave a heart for that i did this no no no god gave it to you give me every blessing everything that you have the cottage you drive the house you live in the money that you made the child that you got everything god gave it to you are you with me and i'm going to give all the glory and all the credit to god amen because if i don't aim it i'm gonna my flesh gonna conquer me amen myself i'm gonna give myself glory amen and i'm tired of this flesh winning amen it's time to let the god win amen it's time that god get all the glory out of our lives it's time for us to deny ourselves conquer this flesh [Music] don't seek vain glory to survive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the what contrite ones amen we ought to be more contrite more no willing to you know just be more willing to just submit to the word amen easily being treated amen not not so stiff and so hard to for folks to penetrate you they all it ought to be a sweet spirit a sweet humble spirit amen the people uh-uh i'm scared you know your spirit ought to be so welcome sweet it ought to be like christ that there's so much love so much sweetness around about you amen that's what we're trying to create an atlas feel love or create an atmosphere amen of the presence of god or somebody that amen has surrendered completely to god amen it's not about us it's not about our material things it's not about vain glory it's it's not about our family our children of this and that it's about christ thank god for everything he's done every blessing that he gave you and realizes god you know job said the lord give it to the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord out of all the things that he had he said the lord gave it to me amen so and and god was able to restore all things because he was going through a test after you suffered a while see uh god was making joke perfect are you with me and god is bringing perfection in us are you with me and that's what sometimes god allows certain things to happen and look like job went through some hard times but he maintained his integrity are you with me and sometimes things happen in life he lost his wife he lost his children lost his cattle loss everything he went down his body was full of sores everything he lost his wife talking like a foolish woman and everything are you what man he had everything to turn against him but yet amen in order for god to look down and says yes have you considered my servant joe what about you can you put your name there amen and can you compare yourself with job amen but sometimes we we we we think that we are job and we think almost uh and we hadn't even you know touched the surface of what it's like to go through some things they meant that job went through and some of these uh uh soldiers in the bible they meant the war that they had to face and the thing trials and tribulations that they had to go through amen we amen have not experienced you know just not even just a little bit of what they had to go through are you with me but the little that god has allowed us to go through amen we got to conquer ourselves are you with me so i got to cut it short deuteronomy uh let's go to deuteronomy 8 judah romans 8. i thank god for you know this journey uh it's it's it's a journey that god is taking us on but it does not mean nothing if you can't hear it you know some people you know you know these come to church the word can't penetrate because they're not interested in it god don't have the attention you know what i'm saying because they're put off god for a future they don't want god now amen no matter what you say i'm not i i don't want god now i i when i when i need him i'll call him but i don't need him now i don't want him i i'm healthy i'm strong and i'm enjoying life and i don't need god now it's only to those you know some folks will wake up at a young age but it's not many young people that wakes up at a young age they when they wake up at a young age amen god can use him and it's such a blessing for them to wake up as young ages but many times the devil has taken our youth and he left uh he said flee youthful lusts that wars against our members but when we're young we trust in our youthfulness are you with me but god wants you to flee that and realize that you got a soul to that state young people are losing their mind young people are being killed and destroyed amen that's the time that the devil amen will amen torment you that's the time the devil will take control those are the times that you need god more than ever write down young people amen because the prophet said if you're gonna make a choice nine out of ten you make that choice when you're young because there's not many people that's old make that choice get that opportunity why because once the devil gets through with you amen oh yes so while you're young if you make that right choice what a beautiful life you can live amen you don't have to go through the misery amen or some of folk that went through all kinds of things that's why i thank god that he saved me when i was young amen if i look back amen praise god all of those years have passed but thank god it's over 40 years but thank god he saved me when i'm young amen he could have let me get old and all beat up by the devil and all all messed up amen but he saved me when i'm young praise god and you that never been out there in the streets and never amen experience that thing thank god amen don't i i mean i i'm so glad i never did it amen oh yes i'm glad it's a blessing brother sister it's a blessing that you never amen had to go that way and never had experience amen oh god would you stay with god to stay with god amen is to be blessed amen it's a blessing to stay with god you don't have to go through some of the stuff that you go through okay it says deuteronomy 8 1 all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and what possess the land which the lord swore unto your fathers now they were going into a natural land the promised land you're going into a spiritual land and this is what we're dealing with you got to conquer yourself this self amen it could be a blessing or curse are you with me so it's up to you amen that this land this promised land that god gives you can be a blessing or curse is how you amen look at it and how you go about it the land that we'll talk about is not a natural land but it's a spiritual land are you with me and your body seems to be the thing amen that god is concerned about amen that you got to know how to possess your body amen how you to conduct your lives amen that you this land could be a a sweet land a land that flows with milk and honey this life that you live amen it could be a life amen of peace and joy and happiness and righteousness it could be holy amen or it could be amen a curse he says and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these what 40 years in the wilderness to what and you know you might you might think why why he says he took them that way to what humbling god resisted the pride but give it grace to the what humble thee but we're not listening you know why god you still won't get don't be humble he said i took you that way to humble you well i ain't gonna put up with this i ain't put up with that you know but he took you that way to humble thee when you listen to god god is saying to humble thee he wants you to be humble he wants me to be humble he wants all of us to be humble are you with me he says the hum of thee and to prove thee and to know what was what if certain things did not happen to you you wouldn't have never knew that certain things lies within you that needed to get fixed those things needed to get straightened out they had to come to the light and god was showing them what was in them but they didn't know what was in them because amen they beat the tamarind they shouted and danced they met they crossed the red sea the egyptian army got drowned in amen you know you're on your way to heaven and enjoying your trip and then little trials and tribulation little things go little problems come up and difficult times come up amen but god amen neither of those times are coming up but he wanted to see how you were going to respond amen to the way that he was leading you the way that he was taking you i want to see what's in your heart i want you to see i want you to see yourself and i want you to be able amen to humble yourself are you with me he says to prove thee to know what was in thy heart whether i would what to keep his commandments or not god wanted to see whether you do it certain things come up here and offers and desires and all kind of battles and all but god don't see what you're going to keep his commandments or not praise god are you still going to live right are you still going to do right do you still want to serve the lord do you still love him or will you just give up and curse your god and die what what is your response what is your reaction because things did not go flow right job didn't do nothing god was just testing him but some of the stuff we go through is because of what we've done the decision we made god's just not testing us we made it we made bad decisions but are we going to be humble enough to say god forgive me and i repent and i want to do right are you with me oh we're going to say well so-and-so did it too that one did it not oh everybody do it i might as well if they did it i did so what i don't care you know the attitude that people have how they respond what's in their heart it's oh lord you brought us out here to die i thought serving the law would be uh uh joy peace and righteousness i thought it would be oh just a wonderful time i came in the church and i thought i was in my own my way to heaven oh lord it was so sweet god was so good but i find i'm on my way to heaven everybody ain't safe what about you what about you did god ever change did god ever change what did god do to you to make you start loving him oh what i see you cannot love god and hate your brother or hate your sister the minute you start looking at others instead of keeping your eyes on the lord then you lose your joy you lose everything you look at your situation your you know you can't look at situations and problems and difficulties you got to keep your eyes on how good god is your road to heaven is keeping your eyes on jesus and say lord you never fail me you never will and god you saved me and i'm thankful every day every hour no matter what come ago lord i love you the more god i can just smile myself how can i be a little bit more humble god give me a little bit more grace hallelujah because i know amen this way amen that you're taking me amen i must need to get a lay outside some weights and things that does so he literally sent me praise god okay so he says know what's in their heart whether thou keep then the the third verse says and he what he humbled thee and suffered thee to what you know god allowed that you know i ain't got no money i can't can't pay my tithes and offering i can't do this i can't even make my bills i can't cut my lights on i can't pay the water bill you know mama helped me daddy help me sister help me brother help me church help me what why i got to go to why i got to go through this you know sometimes we we'll miss church we get two jobs three jobs just to try to make ends meet lord i paid my tithes and my offering and i look like a you say you're opening one into heaven and pull me out blessing i won't have room enough to to receive and lord and you say you never seen the righteous of a second seed begging bread here i am your child and uh and i'm baking bread and and and the wonders of heaven ain't open and and lord i i can't get to church no more and lord you know am i going to complain about the way it takes me to leave me or am i going to say lord i i'm still going to do what i supposed to do concerning you i'm going to submit myself to christ and he is the word and i'm gonna maintain what the words say no matter what i go through i love you lord and if i love you i keep your commandments are you with me see you're gonna trust god no matter what praise god because you know he'll never leave you and he'll never forsake you no matter what you go through christ said i'll be there with you amen and i'll be there for you are you with me so don't never trust in your own conquer yourself amen you got the wall against his flesh are you with me so trust god no matter what comes or what goes amen i got to close here it says suffer thee the hunger and failed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy father's no are you with me that he might make thee known know that man what does not live by what now jesus said that too but he says that to those children of israel as they ventured into the promised land that man does not live by bread alone but what by every word that proceeds from what and and see that's what you defeat the devil with amen eve dotted one word but the bride of the last day amen has one husband your own husband you submit yourselves to your own husband are you with me and that is christ and he is the word and submit yourself to him man does not live by bread only but by what every word that proceeded from the what mouth for god and you know what the church is supposed to be subject to christ right but you really realize that the denominational world in the church world is not subject to christ they're making the church instead of them being subject to the word they're making the word subject to them are you with me they exalt themselves over the word are you with me the church is being exalted over the word the wife is being lifted up over are you with me the woman is being the head of the man instead of man me the head of the woman are you with me that's what the church world is doing they're venturing into amen they're changing amen positions and when they change position amen they it's not humility anymore it's not submission anymore because people are changing oh you look man so when you see amen people you know you show them what the words say and they won't submit themselves to the word amen they're not submitting themselves to christ this they'll uh i i i the word say that but i don't believe that i'm not doing this i'm not doing that see they're not submitting themselves to their husband and the husband is the word are you with me and that's what's wrong that's what's wrong in the church today that's what's wrong with society today amen disrespecting the word amen and when we disrespect the word we disrespect god because he is the word and to say you love him and don't want to keep his word is to say you don't love him if you keep his word you got to humble yourself are you with me you got to conquer yourself by humming yourself amen stay stay in your lane god bless you let us stand praise god are you all right i know i didn't preach this morning but i hope i said something to help you along the way don't get out of position amen the humble is the way the way down is the way up amen he'll lift you up in due time sometimes we have to suffer a little while but be faithful to christ because he'll exalt you in due time is god all right with you amen everybody wants to go to heaven amen if you want to go it takes humility suffering humbling oneself god bless you let us bow father in jesus name what a great time what a wonderful time it is to know that we are here and we have arrived at the last day and the spirits just said about the church the spirit of just being made perfect you come to mount zion you come to the new jerusalem the innumerable couple of angels come to a place where just men's are made perfect father i thank you this morning that you oh god through your word has brought up a
