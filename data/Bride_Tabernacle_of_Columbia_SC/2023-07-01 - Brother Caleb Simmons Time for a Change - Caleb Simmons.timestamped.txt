[34:58] amen if you have your Bibles tonight I'd
[35:00] like to turn to the book of Deuteronomy
[35:03] Deuteronomy chapter 2.
[35:21] Deuteronomy chapter 2 and when you gotta
[35:23] say man
[35:29] and it reads starting at verse one
[35:32] and then we turned and took our journey
[35:35] into the Wilderness by the way of the
[35:37] Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me
[35:41] and we can pass Mount Sinai many days
[35:45] and the Lord spake unto me saying you
[35:48] have compassed this mountain
[35:51] ye have can pass this mountain long
[35:53] enough turn ye northward amen God bless
[35:57] you we know this word you may be seated
[35:59] amen tonight I'd like to speak on a
[36:01] little topic that I entitled
[36:06] time for a change
[36:09] it's time for a change amen
[36:11] I mean I was reading the scripture and I
[36:14] was it was talking about how Israel had
[36:16] come out of Egypt and they had they had
[36:19] come across and God had delivered them
[36:21] from the Egyptians and they had come
[36:23] through the Red Sea and they had seen
[36:25] the mighty miracles of god and they came
[36:27] to the place where they were in the
[36:29] wilderness and they have been circling
[36:31] for 40 years and they were going in
[36:33] circles and they were going in circles
[36:35] and then one day it beca it came to a
[36:37] point that it was time for a change it
[36:40] was time for them to stop going in
[36:42] circles and to turn northward it was
[36:44] time for them to go and accept all the
[36:46] promises that God had given them it was
[36:49] time for them to go get down and say you
[36:51] know what it's time for me to move
[36:52] forward it's time for me to take that's
[36:55] that next step in God let me go see what
[36:58] else he got for me he promised it to me
[37:00] and now it's time for my change it's
[37:03] time for me to change it's time for me
[37:05] to do what I need to do to get closer to
[37:08] God it's time for me to do what I need
[37:10] to do to get my promise is it's time for
[37:13] me to do what I need to do to get all
[37:15] the blessings that God promised me see
[37:17] it was time for a change and the
[37:20] children of Israel got to that point
[37:21] that they realized we got to do
[37:23] something different if we really want to
[37:25] see God move we gotta we gotta change
[37:28] some things if we really want to see God
[37:30] do what he said he was going to do we
[37:32] got to make some movements we got to
[37:34] turn northward it wasn't just something
[37:36] that God said it was there but there's
[37:38] some action had to take place some
[37:40] actions had to go forward they had to do
[37:43] something they couldn't just say oh God
[37:45] promised me this and and yes he promised
[37:48] it to you but what are you doing to get
[37:50] it he said I remember there was a story
[37:53] about a man who who went to heaven one
[37:56] time and he's seen this room I may have
[37:59] said it many times he passed a room that
[38:01] was halfway open and he seen all these
[38:03] gifts and the angel closed the door and
[38:05] he said what was in that room and it's
[38:07] long story short he got to it and then
[38:09] they opened the door and said that was
[38:11] all blessings that God wanted to give
[38:14] you while you was on Earth but you
[38:16] wasn't ready for it see there was some
[38:18] actions that he needed to take in order
[38:20] to get those blessings
[38:22] there was some actions that he needed to
[38:24] do in order to get those blessings but
[38:27] he had to change something he had to
[38:29] change some things I think about there
[38:31] was the Young Rich ruler and he was in
[38:34] he was doing some things and he was
[38:36] going and he finally had to come to his
[38:38] moment that he had to make a change he
[38:42] got to that pig pen and he realized I'm
[38:44] about to eat what the pigs eat but in my
[38:47] father's house there's food enough for
[38:49] the servants they're screwed enough for
[38:51] the animal there's good food for
[38:52] everybody in my father's house there's
[38:55] so many wonderful blessings in my
[38:57] father's house see he got to that moment
[38:58] that he said I got to make a change I
[39:01] can't keep going on this path because
[39:02] there's nothing there for me I'm already
[39:05] in the pigs pin where how much lower can
[39:07] I get how much lower can I get than
[39:10] where I am today see that that's where
[39:12] the that's where the that's where he was
[39:15] but he had to make a change he had to go
[39:18] back from whence he came he had to go
[39:20] back to his father he had to repent and
[39:22] say father I'm sorry
[39:24] see he had to want to do it you can't
[39:27] make a change if you don't want to do it
[39:30] God can't change you if you don't want
[39:32] to be changed her many said that you can
[39:34] go to God but if you don't want to be
[39:36] changed God can't change you he can do
[39:39] it but but he wants you to want to
[39:41] that's why he gave you a will that's why
[39:44] he gave you an opportunity that's why he
[39:46] gave you and told you that you get to
[39:48] make your own decisions
[39:50] because he wants you to choose him he
[39:52] wants you to come to him and say Lord I
[39:55] Want You Lord I want you for myself not
[39:58] because of what someone told me but what
[40:00] I want I want to make a change for
[40:02] myself so yeah the children of Israel
[40:04] had to make the individual decision to
[40:07] change they had to make it even though
[40:09] it was a collective group of people that
[40:12] changed and went northward but they had
[40:14] to make the individual choice to do it
[40:16] for themselves it could have been a
[40:18] whole group of people but it became it
[40:21] came down to what did you want to do in
[40:23] your heart
[40:24] what did you want to do and God asked
[40:27] you what do you want to do in your heart
[40:28] what choices do you want to make do you
[40:31] want to make a change many people you
[40:34] may say hey I'm trying to get them to do
[40:36] this but it's a it's a real thing one
[40:38] day when you come to the realization
[40:40] that they don't want to make the changes
[40:41] that you suggest
[40:43] they don't want to change the path today
[40:45] going because they think that when they
[40:47] get down to the end of that path it's a
[40:49] greatness a glamorous thing but see they
[40:52] might not know that you're giving them
[40:54] advice because you already done seen the
[40:55] end of the role you already done been
[40:58] down there and said there's nothing good
[40:59] down there so make the change now make
[41:02] the change while you can and you don't
[41:05] have to make the mistakes that others
[41:06] have made
[41:08] you don't have to go down those roads
[41:10] one day God came and he he changed some
[41:13] people some people came in front of him
[41:15] and I I said that sometimes you don't
[41:19] even see when the change is evident and
[41:21] I thought about the story of David
[41:24] there was a long time and you look in
[41:26] first Samuel chapter 16. and you notice
[41:29] that Samuel anointed David and David
[41:32] didn't become instantaneously a king
[41:35] he had he went back to the fields
[41:38] he went back to being a Shepherd before
[41:41] he became king see even though he was
[41:43] anointed king that change took a time to
[41:46] come it took a growth even though you
[41:49] may not be able to see it the change has
[41:51] already taken place even though you may
[41:54] be trying to pound it in the change is
[41:56] already taking place because when God
[41:58] changes a thing it may not happen
[42:00] instantaneously doesn't mean that the
[42:02] change hasn't happened I think of if you
[42:05] think of Science and you think of a
[42:06] butterfly it doesn't go from Caterpillar
[42:09] to flying there's a time period that
[42:12] happens it goes into that that worm
[42:14] stage and has to eat and then it goes
[42:16] into the Cocoon then it breaks out of
[42:18] its shell
[42:19] see many times things that maybe look
[42:22] like it's sitting still they in the
[42:24] Cocoon stage they sit and still don't
[42:26] mean that they won't change into the
[42:28] butterfly don't mean that they won't One
[42:30] Day Break Forth out of the thing that's
[42:32] holding them that cage that's holding
[42:34] them and they'll Fly Away you'll say
[42:36] when did that happen see God was doing
[42:39] the work see it was what they had in
[42:41] their heart it was what they got down
[42:43] and said Lord I want you to change me
[42:45] and no one else has to know that
[42:48] decision but you but you say Lord I want
[42:50] you to change me see see see that change
[42:54] was evident over time
[42:57] and see many people came to those
[42:59] moments where they want where God
[43:02] changed them and you're seeing how their
[43:04] life changed each and every one of us if
[43:07] you've been in Christ you know the story
[43:09] of how the Lord changed you
[43:11] how you came to those moments in those
[43:13] Crossroads where you had to make a
[43:15] decision whether you wanted to change or
[43:17] not whether you wanted to go down the
[43:20] path that was set before you or you
[43:21] wanted to do what the Lord called you to
[43:23] do and see there's there's many times
[43:26] when you come to your moment of change
[43:29] but how many people just let that moment
[43:31] pass by
[43:33] and I ask you are you letting that
[43:35] moment pass by all right have you come
[43:38] to that moment and God has called you
[43:40] and you said uh later
[43:43] but then you notice that later may not
[43:46] be promised to you later may not be
[43:49] promised to you and you always push it
[43:51] off and say later maybe tomorrow maybe
[43:54] this time maybe the next time but what
[43:57] if you never come to that time
[43:59] because you're always saying I got time
[44:02] I got time but we don't know when God is
[44:05] going to come and call us we don't know
[44:07] when tomorrow you wake up and folks that
[44:09] you thought was here are gone away and
[44:11] you realize that you missed it you
[44:13] realize that the ones that you was
[44:15] around you don't missed it because you
[44:17] said I got time
[44:18] you don't know when someone may go and
[44:20] push a button and a bomb drops and in
[44:23] the world as you know it is gone you
[44:25] don't know which time that you go to the
[44:26] bank and can't get money because they
[44:28] shut down the banks it can happen
[44:30] instantaneously because it's the moment
[44:34] of change but we saying that we got so
[44:36] much time we got so much time to live
[44:39] our life and I'm gonna get here and I'm
[44:41] gonna grow old you don't know that you
[44:43] don't know that so when you're a moment
[44:46] of opportunity of change comes take the
[44:48] opportunity seize that opportunity step
[44:51] forward and say this is my moment of
[44:53] change I'm getting the opportunity to
[44:56] make a change and I have to make it
[44:58] today
[45:02] she saw he was on the road to Damascus
[45:04] and a light shine from the heaven heaven
[45:07] and he said who out thou Lord and and
[45:10] God came to him that was his moment of
[45:12] change and even though Paul was not
[45:15] changed in that moment he still had to
[45:17] go through and was blinded until the
[45:19] till the man of God prayed for him and
[45:21] he opened his eyes so that he could see
[45:23] but that was his moment of change that
[45:26] was the moment that he got to the Lord
[45:28] called him to do what he got to do and
[45:30] later on he said that all these things
[45:32] that I've learned he was a scholar a
[45:35] scholar he said I counted as not I
[45:37] counted as nothing because that moment
[45:39] of change had changed everything for him
[45:41] it changed his whole outlook on life it
[45:44] changed everything even though he had
[45:45] all these maybe degrees and all these
[45:48] things that he had achieved in life and
[45:50] he realized that was nothing because he
[45:53] had that moment of change but God came
[45:55] down and showed himself to him as a real
[45:57] as as God and who he was and he had that
[46:01] moment of change and his life was
[46:03] changed forever his life will change
[46:05] forever you look at Peter and you say
[46:07] what what Peter he denied Christ three
[46:10] times
[46:12] and and see that God still gave him the
[46:14] keys to the kingdom he knew that he what
[46:17] Peter was going to change and he said
[46:20] after you have been converted strengthen
[46:21] your verb brother after you've been
[46:23] converted go strengthen your brother see
[46:26] there was some even though it was a it
[46:28] was an individual thing but it was an
[46:30] individuals that came together in that
[46:32] Upper Room and they wanted something to
[46:35] change and they said Jesus told him you
[46:37] stay there until you be endured with
[46:39] power because they wanted that change to
[46:42] happen they wanted to stay in there and
[46:44] they wanted to get on one Accord until
[46:46] something happened they wanted that
[46:48] moment of change in their lives
[46:50] they wanted they wanted God to come down
[46:53] so real to them that they knew that he
[46:55] was inside of them he was leading them
[46:58] he was guiding them said on the day of
[47:00] Pentecost 3 000 Souls were saved on one
[47:04] day
[47:05] every and when they spoke every man
[47:07] heard him in his language that's the
[47:09] power of God but it was a moment of
[47:10] change and you could have that moment
[47:13] each and every day in your life but but
[47:16] what are you going to change to get to
[47:17] that moment
[47:18] what are you going to change to get to
[47:20] that moment because whether you realize
[47:22] or not they made sacrifices they got to
[47:25] that upper room and they didn't leave
[47:27] that upper room until something happened
[47:29] they didn't leave there they said I'm
[47:31] going to stay here until I get my change
[47:33] I'm gonna stay here until something
[47:35] changes in my life I'm gonna stay here
[47:38] until God does the work that he promised
[47:40] me he would do he said if I if if I
[47:43] repented of my sins and be baptized that
[47:45] he would fill me with the Holy Ghost
[47:46] that's what he promised me and I'm gonna
[47:48] stay here until my change come and see
[47:51] they stayed there but how often do you
[47:54] leave before your change come
[47:56] how often do you get to the door and you
[47:58] don't go through the door because you
[48:00] stop there before your change come but
[48:02] it's a time for change it's a time that
[48:05] maybe you got to make some sacrifices to
[48:07] say Lord I need a change in my life Lord
[48:10] I need you to lead me and guide me and
[48:12] direct me and Lead Me Lord so I can get
[48:14] that change in my life Lord I want to
[48:17] walk in your power I want to hear your
[48:19] voice Lord I want to walk in with your
[48:21] Authority Lord I want you to lead and
[48:23] guide me Lord so that when I step in
[48:25] lord your presence is with me Lord I
[48:28] want people to feel you Lord not me not
[48:31] anything that I say or anything that I
[48:33] do but Lord I want them to feel you
[48:36] because that's what being a true
[48:38] Christian is about Lord you denying
[48:40] yourself and you're taking up your cross
[48:42] and you're following him so that people
[48:45] will testify that this is God this is
[48:48] God in the midst it's not you there and
[48:50] they know that that God is moving they
[48:53] know that God is real because they see
[48:56] him in you they know that God is real
[48:58] because a change has taken place in your
[49:01] life they may not ever read a Bible but
[49:03] they can look at your life and see the
[49:05] testimony they can look at your life and
[49:07] see how you live and say that's the one
[49:10] that knows God that's one that when they
[49:12] pray I know they can get an answer I
[49:15] know that when they go down on their
[49:16] knees the Lord hears them because a
[49:19] change has taken place they're no longer
[49:21] the same they're no longer going to the
[49:23] same places they no longer doing the
[49:26] same things because a change has taken
[49:28] place see it's time for a change it's
[49:31] time for things to change and God is
[49:34] moving and you have to get along go
[49:36] ahead and make these changes because you
[49:38] don't want to be left behind
[49:40] you don't want God to leave you behind
[49:42] you want to hear him say Well done my
[49:45] good and faithful servant you want to
[49:46] accomplish everything that he set out in
[49:48] your life to do the earlier you do that
[49:51] the better God the scripture says
[49:54] remember now thou Creator in the days of
[49:57] thy youth remember them now you don't
[49:59] get your the one thing that you never
[50:01] get back is time
[50:04] you never get your time back
[50:06] you never get your time back so as your
[50:09] time is the most precious thing that you
[50:11] have it's the most valuable thing that
[50:13] you have and sometimes you have to sit
[50:15] down and reevaluate how do I spend my
[50:18] time
[50:19] how do I spend my time could I be doing
[50:22] more for for the Lord could I be doing
[50:24] more with my life could I be evaluating
[50:28] myself and say where the opportunities
[50:30] the Lord I want you to use me more but
[50:33] even with the more you got to sacrifice
[50:35] more even with the more you got to be
[50:37] led more because you don't want to be
[50:39] doing the wrong doing God a service
[50:41] without it being his will you don't want
[50:43] to be doing things outside of God's will
[50:46] see it's time for a change
[50:48] and God is calling us to to get ready
[50:51] for this change I believe God wants to
[50:54] do great things and more than we can
[50:56] even see or imagine what God wants to do
[50:59] it but it takes a change it takes people
[51:03] getting together on one Accord and
[51:05] saying Lord do something in my life Lord
[51:09] do something in my life Lord I I don't
[51:12] know what you want to do but Lord Do It
[51:14] In My Life
[51:15] see all it takes is one
[51:17] that's all it takes is one person it
[51:20] only took one person to set a whole city
[51:23] on fire
[51:24] when that woman of the world when she
[51:25] had got her change when she met Jesus
[51:28] she went back and told everybody and the
[51:31] change that had taken place led a whole
[51:34] city on fire
[51:35] it only takes one
[51:37] see but it's time for your change
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:53] praise God it's time for a change amen

[55:22] the holy spirit is saying claim if you
[55:24] need to lay in prayer don't move it's
[55:27] just like Jacob did is that right Jacob
[55:29] wrestled all night when he wrestled all
[55:32] night he knew that God was going to do a
[55:35] move for him is that right you can hold
[55:37] on to God uh who can hold on to God what
[55:40] holds on to God is your inner man is
[55:43] that right Paul was going through nature
[55:45] is that right he was Warren with the
[55:47] flesh but the inner man inside of him he
[55:50] said I Delight in the word of God in the
[55:53] Inner Man is that right God's brought us
[55:55] a word from the foundation of the world
[55:57] and we came before the foundation of the
[56:00] world he he was telling him is that
[56:02] right self-existing one we are there all
[56:06] by himself then when he came to that he
[56:08] left Genesis 1. he made Man created man
[56:11] in His image and his likeness then after
[56:13] he fell down again he jumped over the
[56:15] revelations to I mean res Genesis 2 is
[56:18] that right he formed that's what from
[56:20] the dust of the earth is that right in
[56:22] the beginning was the word the Word was
[56:24] God the word was with God the word
[56:26] became flesh then he dwelled down in US
[56:29] is that right well now what body spirit
[56:31] and soul see taste feels smell and hear
[56:35] consists of the flesh is that right then
[56:38] we come with the spirit man and now
[56:40] we're talking about the inner man that's
[56:42] talking brother Ernest he in the man
[56:44] feeds off one thing what is that the
[56:46] word of God down in the soul move back
[56:49] Satan God's bride is stepping out don't
[56:52] be afraid of anything be rejoicing
[56:55] praise God for the souls that's going to

[57:12] Minister about three sometimes four
[57:14] times a week in the prisons in the jails
[57:17] God opened those doors back
[57:19] but you know when you're coming in when
[57:21] I go in there I'm specifically coming
[57:23] for one reason to get back God's
[57:27] children is that right is that right we
[57:30] are the bride he's given us the message
[57:32] of the hour and again so we don't have
[57:36] to fear anything any of your loved ones

[57:44] to go through the prayer line let the
[57:47] Sinners come when we come let them come

[59:24] y'all already started
[59:25] have your hands started
[59:27] starting when you Holy Ghost tell you
[59:30] amen
[59:31] but we usually try to tell the church
[59:33] waiting after the fourth because some of
[59:36] y'all want to eat during the fall
[59:38] but after the fourth you know it's time
[59:42] to go into fasting and we wanted we want
[59:44] to label before God In Prayer
[59:48] brother Hammett said he's going to try
[59:50] to bring his church down and

[59:56] uh and so by the grace of God and they
[59:58] want to come amen
[1:00:00] so by the grace of God we want to look
[1:00:02] forward to God moving
[1:00:04] you could get under expectation amen
[1:00:08] for the Holy Ghost to move in a special
[1:00:10] way
[1:00:12] and I tell you the sacrifice you make in
[1:00:16] prayer
[1:00:17] and then fasting and seeking God
[1:00:20] when you come with expectation for God
[1:00:22] to move amen
[1:00:25] so we thank God tonight for the change
[1:00:27] has come
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] for you have been changed
[1:00:33] amen and if you haven't been changed
[1:00:36] what are you waiting on
[1:00:39] if you're waiting what are you waiting
[1:00:41] on
[1:00:42] amen you can't get it unless
[1:00:46] you want it
[1:00:48] amen Jesus is not going to force himself
[1:00:51] on you
[1:00:52] he already did enough he died he shedded
[1:00:55] his blood he's not going to force
[1:00:57] himself amen
[1:00:58] whosoever will he said let him come
[1:01:02] you said well I'm too young for a change
[1:01:05] praise God but I want to change now amen
[1:01:10] God want to change your life and make it
[1:01:13] make you
[1:01:14] ready for rapture
[1:01:17] ready to go back to Glory when because
[1:01:21] you may not this world may not last
[1:01:22] another 10 or 15 years 20 years
[1:01:27] the bomb can fall anytime
[1:01:31] but are you ready
[1:01:33] it's better to be changed now
[1:01:36] because if you're not changed now you
[1:01:38] won't be changed then
[1:01:41] are you with me
[1:01:42] if you don't give your life to Jesus
[1:01:44] Christ I wonder how all those people
[1:01:47] going to heaven and they didn't want to
[1:01:49] worship God here but when they die they
[1:01:52] go automatic go to heaven
[1:01:55] see
[1:01:57] the Bible said as the tree falls so let
[1:02:00] it lie
[1:02:02] are you with me
[1:02:04] praise God you can't
[1:02:06] make a corrupt tree bring forth good
[1:02:08] fruit
[1:02:09] are you with me
[1:02:11] if you die in your sin
[1:02:15] don't expect to rise up in righteousness
[1:02:21] are you with me so a lot of people under
[1:02:24] expectation all of a sudden they just
[1:02:26] spent their time in the nightclub
[1:02:28] singing for the devil you know doing all
[1:02:30] kind of devilish stuff but when they die
[1:02:32] or that person was a good person and oh
[1:02:35] Lord
[1:02:38] Mata was nice personality but didn't
