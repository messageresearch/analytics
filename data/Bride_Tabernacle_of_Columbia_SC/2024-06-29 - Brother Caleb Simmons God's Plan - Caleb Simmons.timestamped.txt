[33:44] in such a mighty and a special way in
[33:47] Jesus name we pray amen
[33:50] amen amen if you have your Bibles
[33:53] tonight ask you to turn to Genesis chap
[34:11] 37 very familiar
[34:18] scripture and a very familiar
[34:21] Story chapter 37
[34:28] and we'll start in the 28th
[34:31] verse and there passed by the midianites
[34:35] merchant men and they drew and they
[34:37] lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold
[34:40] Joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces
[34:43] of silver and they brought
[34:46] Joseph into in into Egypt and Reuben
[34:50] return and Reuben returned unto the pit
[34:52] and behold Joseph was not in the pit and
[34:56] rent his clothes and he returned unto
[34:59] his brother and said the child is not
[35:01] and I whether shall I go God bless the
[35:04] readings of his word and you may be
[35:06] seated amen if you read down and you
[35:09] read more into the story you find out
[35:11] that Joseph ends up in Egypt amen how
[35:14] many know the story tonight amen amen
[35:16] Joseph end UPS in Egypt and I entitled a
[35:19] little topic that I I call God's plan
[35:24] God's plan and if you talk about the
[35:26] story of Joseph he realized that when
[35:28] Joseph got into the midst of many things
[35:31] he didn't understand the reason but it
[35:34] was all part of God's plan and realizing
[35:37] that God took him through things to show
[35:39] for that he had a reason for why he went
[35:41] through he had a reason for what he was
[35:44] going through even though Joseph didn't
[35:46] understand and Joseph didn't even
[35:48] understand the plan but he trusted him
[35:51] he trusted God throughout all that he
[35:52] was going through and if you go to
[35:55] chapter 39 and verse
[35:58] 20 Joseph ended up working for This Man
[36:01] Called Piper and because of the gift
[36:03] that God had given Joseph the Lord
[36:06] allowed him to be elevated no matter
[36:08] where he went no matter what he was
[36:10] doing God allowed him to be elevated and
[36:12] he gave him favor he gave him favor in
[36:15] the sight of men and then in this story
[36:17] it says that Joseph wife she came and
[36:20] she tempted well Piper's wife she came
[36:22] and she tempted Joseph and she tempted
[36:25] him and ended up telling a lie on him
[36:28] and ended up in verse 20 it says and
[36:31] Joseph's Master took him and put him
[36:33] into the prison a place where the king's
[36:36] prisoners were bound and he was there in
[36:38] prison see one day Joseph got bound but
[36:42] it was just part of his journey it
[36:44] wasn't the end of his journey it was
[36:46] part of his journey because God had a
[36:48] plan for his life and when he was going
[36:51] through the Journey people lied on them
[36:53] people mistreated them but Joseph had to
[36:55] go to prison to end up on the throne am
[36:58] Joseph had to go to prison he had to be
[37:00] lied on to end up in in front of pharaoh
[37:03] and it was a purpose in the plan that
[37:05] God had for him even though Joseph might
[37:07] not have understood there was a purpose
[37:09] in God to his brothers throwing him in
[37:12] the pit and being jealous and sometimes
[37:14] we look at life and we go through things
[37:16] and why this person don't like me Joseph
[37:19] own family didn't like him and they
[37:21] threw him in a pit and sold him away and
[37:24] that was their own flesh and blood and
[37:26] just imagine just and you look at
[37:28] yourself and say why I have to go
[37:30] through these things but if Joseph
[37:32] hadn't been sold he wouldn't end up in
[37:34] potier house if he wouldn't end up in
[37:36] potera house and ptera wife lying on him
[37:39] he would have end up in prison and if
[37:41] you read down in the story some more it
[37:44] you realize that when he got to prison
[37:46] he ran into a couple of people that
[37:48] worked in Pharaoh's house and they both
[37:50] had dreams and God gave Joseph the the
[37:54] ability to interpret dreams it was a
[37:56] gift that God had given him and God used
[37:59] those gifts see see that when God gives
[38:01] you something it's a reason for him
[38:03] giving it to you it's all a part of his
[38:05] purpose and his plan Joseph had this
[38:08] disability when he was a child but he
[38:10] didn't know the things that it was going
[38:12] to turn into later on down in life he
[38:14] didn't realize the benefit of what it
[38:16] was the gift that he had as a child
[38:19] where was going to benefit him in the
[38:20] end and he ended up interpreting the
[38:22] dream and he said I got one request when
[38:25] you go back and you see Pharaoh remember
[38:28] me amen and sometimes you may be in a
[38:30] low Place may be in a dark place but
[38:33] wherever you find yourself in that's
[38:35] what Paul said no matter what place of
[38:37] space I find myself in I found out there
[38:40] with to be content cuz he realized that
[38:42] even though no matter how bad it got God
[38:45] always had a plan it wasn't just
[38:47] something that was willy-nilly happening
[38:48] to him it was something that God had
[38:50] planned out and ordered his steps and he
[38:53] had a way for him to go and when he was
[38:55] going to get there he would realize why
[38:57] God had took him that way so you might
[38:59] not understand the purpose or the plan
[39:02] but all you have to do is trust him and
[39:04] God will show you eventually it might
[39:06] not be tomorrow but he'll show you why
[39:08] he took you that way why he let this
[39:11] happen why he let that trial happen it
[39:13] was only to give him glory see God had a
[39:17] plan and see God has a way that he might
[39:20] not show you I originally entitled I
[39:22] said God's hidden plan cuz sometime God
[39:25] knows the plan but it's hidden from you
[39:27] it's not plain to you you don't always
[39:30] know where the end of the steps going to
[39:31] lead you but if you keep going up
[39:34] eventually you will land you won't be
[39:36] traveling far it's not a stair step
[39:38] where keep going in a circle but even if
[39:41] it's going in a circle God don't let it
[39:43] continue to go on the circle eventually
[39:45] you'll be able to walk straight and walk
[39:47] plain cuz God allows that to happen and
[39:50] sometimes he leads you through it to
[39:52] make you stronger amen you get on the
[39:54] stair step when you do it and many of
[39:56] times if you ever on one if you haven't
[39:59] let me tell you about it it'll get you
[40:01] sweating it'll get you tired and your
[40:04] legs might be hurting and when you get
[40:05] off you start to
[40:06] wobble and see when you go through
[40:09] certain things it's such a burden on you
[40:11] sometimes that it'll cause you to wobble
[40:14] but if you keep doing it you get
[40:15] stronger if you keep going through it
[40:17] and realize Lord even throughing my test
[40:19] and trial I found a way to thank you
[40:22] yall find a way to thank you cuz even
[40:25] though I don't understand you have a
[40:28] I was going through something and I got
[40:30] to the space and I was I transitioned to
[40:34] working on a job and you know what when
[40:35] I first got there you know sometimes we
[40:38] have these things in our mind of how we
[40:40] think or things should
[40:42] go so we sitting in and sometimes I was
[40:45] sitting in a meeting and I was like I
[40:47] don't know why they up there talking
[40:48] about stuff we already know cuz
[40:51] sometimes you go you you sitting in the
[40:52] class and you be like I don't know why
[40:53] the teacher teaching me something that I
[40:55] already know so I got there and I
[40:57] started thinking these things in my mind
[40:59] and I started thinking and then
[41:00] something came to me and said you know
[41:02] what God put you here he had a reason
[41:05] for putting you here so thank him
[41:07] because you didn't have to be here he
[41:09] didn't have to place you here and while
[41:11] I was going through it I started
[41:12] changing my I said Lord thank you I'm
[41:14] just grateful to be here and then they
[41:17] start telling us how many people applied
[41:19] for the position and didn't get it and
[41:21] they said yeah you was one of 1500 I
[41:24] said oh cuz I I I didn't look at it like
[41:28] that cuz I didn't know I looked at it I
[41:30] just just happen chance to be here and
[41:32] sometimes we go through life and we just
[41:34] happen chance to be here and that's how
[41:36] we take it for granted and don't realize
[41:38] that God had a reason and a plan and he
[41:41] specifically put you there and put the
[41:43] people around you so that you could be
[41:45] there for a reason amen cuz he had a
[41:47] plan even though you might not have
[41:49] understood it but he had a plan for why
[41:52] he took you through it and so I started
[41:54] to changeing my attitude it's like you
[41:56] know what how can I be a benefit how can
[41:59] I be a blessing how can I cuz God put me
[42:01] here for a reason and I don't even
[42:04] understand to the point I started
[42:05] thinking we was having another meeting
[42:07] and I I thought sometimes your mouth can
[42:09] get ahead of you before before you
[42:12] before you actually do a thing so you
[42:14] start talking and I said oops I might
[42:16] have done overs
[42:18] spoke but even in my what I was thinking
[42:21] was over speaking God allowed that to be
[42:23] a testimony of what he was doing and I
[42:26] started and I'm starting to even seeing
[42:28] the blessing said you know what God was
[42:30] even I prayed Lord let your will be done
[42:33] I prayed Lord give me wisdom and even in
[42:36] those moments that I'm looking back I
[42:38] said you know what I didn't over speak
[42:40] there were some people that didn't speak
[42:41] up enough and they ended up doing
[42:43] something that they didn't necessarily
[42:45] think that they wanted to do but I was
[42:47] speaking and I was just asking questions
[42:49] as the Lord was leading me and I was
[42:51] like asking this and asking that and I
[42:53] ended up in a place that I was using
[42:55] things that I've already learned and
[42:57] it's a benefit and I started saying you
[43:00] know what maybe that was God's plan for
[43:02] me to just open he gave me the mouth for
[43:04] a reason he he ordered your lips
[43:07] sometimes and you speak and God will
[43:08] bless it and move in a way that you
[43:10] don't even understand you don't can't
[43:13] see what the things that you are
[43:14] speaking but sometimes you got to be
[43:16] careful what you
[43:17] speak you got to be careful
[43:20] because Pastor was saying something the
[43:22] other day he said I'm going to hold it
[43:24] cuz the devil
[43:25] listening and said sometimes you
[43:27] speaking the thing and the devil
[43:28] listening he said oh mhm and he make
[43:32] sure that he come down and and bother
[43:34] you just in that moment of what you
[43:35] speaking about so some things you got to
[43:38] hold but some things you can make plain
[43:40] in faith amen it's not about what you
[43:42] thinking or what you're going through
[43:44] it's about what you're speaking in faith
[43:46] and you speaking this thing in faith
[43:48] that you know that God honors his word
[43:50] cuz you'll never go wrong speaking God's
[43:52] word you'll never go wrong calling out
[43:55] his promises cuz he's still God
[43:57] and he said if I put it in my word it's
[43:59] for you to speak it so it can be made
[44:02] may come to come plain before you I said
[44:05] Jesus had a reason that I thought about
[44:06] in Joshua what talks about Rahab and
[44:10] said that he sent those two spies into
[44:12] the land those spies didn't know that
[44:14] Rahab was in that City they didn't know
[44:16] that somebody was going to spread the
[44:17] words that spy was in the city and they
[44:19] was going to be stuck in that City but
[44:22] God had a plan through all the time even
[44:24] all Rahab might not have what we call
[44:27] the best life she might not have had the
[44:29] best testimony and if you get a chance
[44:31] to read it in Joshua chapter 2 you'll
[44:33] read about her story and what she was
[44:36] and those men she she just had something
[44:39] in her that nobody understood but she
[44:41] had that heart I said sometimes you
[44:43] don't see the heart of a person you just
[44:45] see their actions you just hear what
[44:47] they say but you don't see their heart I
[44:50] said many a times you don't know who may
[44:52] make it just because of what God has
[44:54] placed in them that you cannot see amen
[44:57] and I said that Rahab she had the heart
[45:00] heart she said I heard about y'all and I
[45:03] know that these things that that y'all
[45:05] saying is true so I'm going to hide you
[45:07] and she hit him and then you look down
[45:09] and you read the story and you go to
[45:11] Matthew and you realize that God used
[45:13] her even with her life God came and took
[45:16] her and she he put her in the lineage of
[45:18] Jesus amen amen see God had a plan amen
[45:23] it was something that we didn't
[45:24] understand and we probably wouldn't have
[45:25] chose to because we she did this and he
[45:28] did that and all these things that had
[45:30] happened to her but God even used her to
[45:31] save her whole family amen see God had a
[45:35] purpose and God had a plan and she
[45:37] wasn't afraid to go tell them come into
[45:39] my house because this city is going to
[45:41] fall she wasn't afraid to go tell
[45:43] somebody that there was destruction that
[45:45] was on the way you need to get in and
[45:47] you need to get in now because God has
[45:50] provided me a way of escape and as long
[45:53] as you was in these doors with that cord
[45:54] hanging out that window God will protect
[45:57] you and keep you too see they might not
[45:59] have knew the god that she knew but you
[46:01] know what they said I'm going to listen
[46:04] that was the difference some of them
[46:05] realize you know what you know it was
[46:07] something might have been deep in inside
[46:09] you know what she telling the truth and
[46:11] and they came and they came into her
[46:13] house and they were saved with her amen
[46:15] see sometimes you never know what you
[46:17] speaking and who's listening you never
[46:20] know what words are going to touch
[46:21] somebody life that because God has a
[46:23] plan in using you to reach somebody my
[46:26] mentor used to say he said don't ever
[46:28] get afraid of other people no matter
[46:30] what the level or anything cuz he said
[46:33] what God got who God got for them to
[46:35] reach and who he got you to reach and
[46:38] who he got you to reach he ain't got
[46:39] them to reach that's why God he used in
[46:41] the word where he gave the many
[46:43] different gifts he wouldn't have gave
[46:45] all the gifts and one could reach
[46:47] everybody amen but he did that for a
[46:50] reason to show he's a god of variety he
[46:52] knew that there was going to be somebody
[46:54] that was going to be that was going to
[46:55] hear him when he preached some is going
[46:57] to hear him when he teach somebody
[46:58] wasn't going to hear him until he
[46:59] prophesy amen but that was God gave them
[47:02] so that he could reach him because he
[47:03] has a plan he knows that one day he he
[47:07] won't lose him so he had to give away to
[47:09] reach everyone and said that I thought
[47:12] about and I read in the scripture about
[47:13] Samson I said you know that even though
[47:16] Samson he fell but God had a purpose in
[47:19] him amen amen Samson it might have been
[47:22] that Samson had gotten lifted up and
[47:23] said you know what it's just me I know
[47:26] what it is it's my hair but maybe he
[47:29] wanted to see what it was like to not
[47:30] have
[47:32] it we don't know but he fell and he
[47:35] allowed Rahab to trick him but he
[47:38] knew Delilah yep that's the one see all
[47:42] of us make
[47:43] mistakes and you know sometimes most
[47:46] people all they hear is the
[47:48] mistake well maybe it was for somebody
[47:50] to wake up
[47:52] so so de Delilah he allowed Delilah to
[47:56] trick him but when when Delilah he got
[47:59] down and he was they imprisoned him and
[48:02] and Samson had to pay for his mistak
[48:04] they took his eyes but one day he might
[48:07] have been he had maybe God allowed him
[48:10] to go there to get along I said don't
[48:13] don't let let don't have a fall and
[48:15] someone to take your eyes for you to get
[48:17] along with God cuz then he started to
[48:19] remember all the things that God had
[48:22] done and he got to that point he said
[48:25] and they got to having a great feast and
[48:27] they remember oh Samson here let's go
[48:29] pick at him but they didn't realize his
[48:31] hair was coming back they didn't realize
[48:33] they might have did it once but you got
[48:35] to keep that they had to always keep
[48:37] maintaining it and his hair had grew
[48:39] back and Samson got to the point he said
[48:41] once more Lord he realized that no
[48:44] matter what all the things he said he
[48:46] had got right with God by there he said
[48:48] if I die that's fine with me but Lord
[48:50] while I'm dying take all the rest of
[48:52] them with me and they and they said
[48:54] during this time there was more he said
[48:57] let me die with the Philistines and he
[48:59] bowed himself with all his might and the
[49:01] house fell upon the Lord and upon the
[49:03] people that were therein so so the death
[49:07] which he slew at his dead the dead so
[49:09] the dead which he slew at his death were
[49:11] more than which he slew in his life
[49:15] amen see he got to the end and realized
[49:18] you know even if I die Lord let me take
[49:20] them all with me he he he he wasn't
[49:23] leaving none of those demons to
[49:24] terrorize none of the people of God that
[49:27] was left he said I want to take all of
[49:29] them when I go I want to make sure that
[49:31] these Devils don't don't don't bother
[49:33] them no more that these demons don't go
[49:36] around that these people are not going
[49:38] to torment your people anymore because
[49:40] if that's the that can be the greatest
[49:43] part of my testimony it was a story of
[49:46] redemption see God had a plan he
[49:48] redeemed Samson and he brought him and
[49:50] lot him to slew more in his death than
[49:53] he did in his entire life some people
[49:55] just look at the moment and they look at
[49:58] they look at what's done in a lifetime
[50:00] but in that death sometimes you can
[50:01] reach the greatest amount of people just
[50:04] from the life that he live and they said
[50:06] I think they said he slew
[50:08] 3,000 in his death and and and I
[50:12] remember one time they said with a I
[50:14] think with a Jawbone he slew a thousand
[50:16] but see that that life that he had
[50:19] realized and got back with God and God
[50:21] used him in a mighty way because he had
[50:23] a plan and said even in Samson's fall
[50:26] God had a plan Samson might not have
[50:29] understood it or knew it and said and he
[50:32] had a plan in
[50:34] it said God has a way of turning every
[50:37] situation and Circumstance around for
[50:40] his glory if that's his will God has a
[50:43] way of doing that and and I thought
[50:46] about it um in Isaiah he said for my
[50:49] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[50:51] are your ways my ways sayth the Lord see
[50:54] God has a way that he knows what he
[50:56] wants and he knows his will and he has a
[50:59] way for your life to go but God put us
[51:01] on Earth to give us a choice amen he
[51:03] allowed you to say yes and no but even
[51:06] in that sometimes he'll take you around
[51:08] like he did the children of Israel 40
[51:10] years into the Wilderness before he
[51:12] allowed them to enter their Promised
[51:14] Land because he had a reason for it
[51:16] because some of them they didn't
[51:18] believe I said much more if we just
[51:21] believe we can go on we can mature we
[51:24] can get all the promises of God by just
[51:27] believeing see but God has a plan and he
[51:29] has a way of sometimes he got to take
[51:31] you through it for you to understand
[51:33] that he's still God and he's still the
[51:35] one that heals he's still the one that
[51:37] delivers he's still the one that sets
[51:39] free because he has a plan in all of it
[51:42] and even though you might not understand
[51:44] it he still got that plan for you all
[51:46] you got to do is trust him believe in
[51:48] him and completely Surrender Your Life
[51:50] to him that's it and that's all he wants
[51:53] from you because his and that's his way
[51:56] I said brother brandom he he told a
[51:59] story about one day having a plane and
[52:01] that plane being delayed many of us know
[52:03] the story but if you don't there was
[52:05] somebody that was praying amen that got
[52:08] down on their knees and brother brandom
[52:10] didn't understand why he he had to go
[52:13] this way but and I asked the question I
[52:15] said but he felt something leading him
[52:18] and he listened and I thought about it I
[52:20] asked the question are we tuned in
[52:22] enough to hear when God speaks to
[52:25] us are we tuned in enough to hear when
[52:28] God speaks to us and if we are do we
[52:31] listen cuz it's something to hear it but
[52:34] it's another thing to listen and do it
[52:37] that's totally different remember many
[52:39] times I thought about it sometimes your
[52:40] parents can tell you to do a thing and
[52:42] you listen you heard it and they say go
[52:44] in one year and come out the other and
[52:47] sometimes we do God the same way we hear
[52:49] them we listen but but sometimes he ask
[52:52] us to do a hard thing just like he asked
[52:55] he asked that Young Rich truler it might
[52:57] have been something that seemed hard to
[52:59] him but if he would have known where his
[53:01] end was going to be he would have done
[53:03] it I think if you could go back and ask
[53:05] him right now if he would have known
[53:07] what his end was going to be do you
[53:08] think he would have done it he probably
[53:10] would tell you yes if he known that he
[53:12] was going to end up where he ended up he
[53:14] would have done it in a heartbeat but he
[53:16] couldn't go back sometimes you got to
[53:18] listen when that knock come to your door
[53:20] because you never know when it's that's
[53:22] the last one that's that last knock
[53:24] that's coming through your coming to you
[53:26] cuz God got a purpose and he got a plan
[53:28] that's why he comes and knocks at your
[53:30] door that's why he comes because he has
[53:32] a way of getting your attention of
[53:34] getting your attention getting my
[53:36] attention and each one he deals with us
[53:38] individually it's not the way that he
[53:39] reaches out to me he might reach out to
[53:41] you but God still does it because he got
[53:43] a plan and he has a purpose and he has a
[53:46] way that seems unseemly to man but it's
[53:49] his way and that's the one that he wants
[53:51] to lead you and guide you but when he
[53:53] comes you got to answer amen God Don't
[53:55] Force us way through the door amen he
[53:58] come there he knocking he wants you to
[54:00] open it because he gave you the choice
[54:03] even though he has a purpose in a plan
[54:05] he still wants you to say Lord I
[54:07] Surrender Lord I Surrender and you never
[54:10] get too high that you can't get down and
[54:12] say Lord I Surrender never forget that
[54:15] you can you are not Mighty enough and
[54:17] strong enough and high enough to get get
[54:19] lifted up in yourself that you can't say
[54:22] Lord I Surrender and if you ain't done
[54:24] it in a while maybe you have to go back
[54:25] to it and say Lord I'm sorry Lord I got
[54:28] lifted up in myself Lord I thought I can
[54:30] do it because what you don't want to do
[54:32] is let God humble
[54:34] you because God has a way of humbling
[54:36] you that you don't know how it's going
[54:38] to end up but let you you get down on
[54:41] your knees and say Lord I come before
[54:43] you as humble as I know how because I
[54:45] don't know what I'm doing Lord I don't
[54:47] know the way I don't know the plan that
[54:49] you have for me but Lord I'm coming and
[54:51] I'm searching it out I'm getting on my
[54:53] knees and said Lord I need you to make
[54:56] it plain to me Lord I need you to lead
[54:58] me I need you to guide me cuz I don't
[55:00] know the way but sometimes you get a
[55:03] little lifted up cuz others will do that
[55:06] to you they'll put you in position that
[55:08] you you forget that it's just by grace
[55:10] and mercy that you even there it's just
[55:13] by grace and mercy that God has given
[55:15] you the ability to be there and you
[55:18] listening to them and you start well I
[55:20] did this and I did that and I did this
[55:23] but that's just a trap of the enemy cuz
[55:25] he wants you to start thinking that you
[55:27] did it all but if you start realizing
[55:29] you know it's just a blessing that I'm
[55:31] here it's just a blessing that God plac
[55:34] me here and Lord if it wasn't for the
[55:36] ones that were around me I wouldn't even
[55:38] be here if it wasn't for you touching
[55:40] their heart giving them to see me in a
[55:43] good light Lord if it wasn't for you
[55:45] being trained up in the right way being
[55:47] brought up in the right house and learn
[55:49] that good man is in different things I
[55:51] wouldn't be where I am today see but you
[55:53] don't think about those small things
[55:56] because you done under maiden and you
[55:57] have arrived Jesus thank you Lord but
[56:00] God has a plan and see that plan it's
[56:03] not how you thought it was that's why
[56:05] sometimes God got to let you be relieved
[56:07] of certain things so you can get clear
[56:10] and realize it's only by him that you
[56:12] made it where you was it's only by him
[56:15] that you are where you are because it's
[56:17] by the grace of God see that's part of
[56:19] his plan too that's why he went to
[56:21] Calvary and died so that you could
[56:23] understand what Mercy was so that you
[56:25] could understand what Grace was and so
[56:28] that you could take advantage of it he
[56:30] didn't just do it so no one would take
[56:32] advantage of it but he wanted you to go
[56:34] there and lay down and realize that it's
[56:36] only by his grace and mercy it's only
[56:38] because he loved you Lord and see I'm
[56:41] learning more and more day and day as
[56:43] you go through things that you know lord
[56:45] it's all because of you it's only
[56:48] because of you that I'm here it's only
[56:50] because of you that I'm even going
[56:52] through what I'm going through because
[56:54] if it wasn't for you and you start
[56:55] looking at it and thinking about say
[56:57] Lord is for your glory Lord Is For Your
[57:00] Glory and then you start looking at it
[57:02] and even though you might have some hard
[57:04] moments because you're human even though
[57:06] you might have some down moments because
[57:09] you're human but if you look sometimes
[57:10] God will bring somebody just to say a
[57:12] word to touch your KNE to touch you in
[57:15] that moment so you can be uplifted and
[57:17] remember that it's only because of God
[57:19] that you can even have pain there are
[57:22] some people that are dead and gone they
[57:23] can't feel nothing sometimes you say
[57:25] Lord want it no more but I don't want to
[57:28] feel it no more but there there's a
[57:31] reason why God gives you the pain
[57:33] there's some people that I remember I
[57:35] was in a in a in an instruction um
[57:40] Taekwondo class and they was said you
[57:42] had to do a certain thing said how
[57:44] people use their body is they deaden the
[57:46] nerves in them so they don't feel pain
[57:49] but there's a reason why God gives you
[57:51] pain so that you'll know something is
[57:53] wrong say some of those people they go
[57:55] and they break their leg and never feel
[57:58] it but God has a reason for everything
[58:01] that he built he put these things there
[58:03] so that you would understand you would
[58:05] feel this thing and said it's a blessing
[58:07] to feel pain sometimes because when you
[58:09] feel when when you come through the pain
[58:11] you more grateful and thankful for not
[58:14] feeling pain you more grateful and
[58:16] thankful that you don't have to feel
[58:18] pain no more when you have a good day
[58:20] versus a bad day when you don't feel
[58:22] like the world is crashing down on you
[58:24] cuz sometimes you do feel that that if
[58:27] you're human and you live long enough
[58:28] you experience that sometimes and but
[58:31] it's something when God lifts you up
[58:33] it's something when you go to him and
[58:34] you lead those burdens on him and you
[58:36] can feel the burdens be lifted because
[58:39] he has a plan for allowing you he just
[58:41] want to show you that I'm a heavy I'm a
[58:43] heavy lifter that I can lift all your
[58:45] burdens I can deliver you from
[58:47] everything that you're going through all
[58:49] you got to do is come to me and lay it
[58:51] down all you got to do is come to me and
[58:53] trust me all you got to do is realize
[58:56] that I have a plan for you that I have
[58:58] something and a purpose that I want you
[59:00] to fulfill but all you got to do is
[59:02] trust me yes Lord if you don't trust him
[59:05] you'll never figure out what his plan is
[59:07] you will never get down humble enough to
[59:09] realize that it's not what you want but
[59:11] it's what he wants for your life it's
[59:13] not what you want to do it's what he
[59:15] wants you to do with your life because
[59:17] he has a plan for you am said I can
[59:21] think about and I read the prophet of
[59:23] God he talks about he talks about the
[59:25] geese and how that God gives him what he
[59:28] called instinct to move from one place
[59:30] to another but he realized that they
[59:32] wouldn't survive if he didn't give it to
[59:34] him see God put put this in him because
[59:37] he had a plan that he had a way of
[59:39] allowing them to move from place to
[59:41] place he put it inside of them that they
[59:44] would know that when a certain
[59:46] temperature or a certain time it said
[59:48] when you can tell with like the horses
[59:50] and the animals they can tell when the
[59:52] storm's coming a long way before you see
[59:54] that storm it's something that he placed
[59:56] in them see he has a plan that he warns
[59:59] you they said many of times when an
[1:00:01] earthquake comes all the animals they
[1:00:03] they disappear from the place because
[1:00:06] they God had a plan before them that
[1:00:08] they know so sometimes all you have to
[1:00:11] do is listen and watch and many times we
[1:00:13] don't watch and ask God lord what's your
[1:00:15] plan Lord what you have me to do Lord
[1:00:19] what would you have me to go and others
[1:00:21] may even see it before you do the people
[1:00:24] that don't go to church sometimes they
[1:00:26] see a thing before you do cuz they
[1:00:28] recognize hey this ain't natural hey
[1:00:30] this ain't normal um you can't see this
[1:00:33] and and you sitting there and sometimes
[1:00:35] it it gets you sometimes because when
[1:00:38] you when when you finally on see it it's
[1:00:41] like man I was sitting in here the whole
[1:00:42] time and I didn't see this but God has a
[1:00:45] reason that sometimes it's just to wake
[1:00:47] you up that you got to get closer to him
[1:00:49] to hear and see and search out what his
[1:00:52] plan is for you what he wants you to do
[1:00:54] and how he wants you to do it because
[1:00:56] God has a way that we may not understand
[1:00:58] but it's all a part of his plan it's all
[1:01:01] in what he wants us to do it's all in
[1:01:04] how he's leading us and guiding us but
[1:01:06] if you never ask him Lord what would you
[1:01:08] have me to do Lord what is your plan for
[1:01:11] my life you'll never find it out you
[1:01:14] will never understand or you will never
[1:01:16] see it because you're not looking for it
[1:01:19] and many of times we get well we don't
[1:01:21] want to look for it because we got our
[1:01:22] idea for what we want and how we want it
[1:01:25] to go go but we realize that if you one
[1:01:29] of God's children you can go in that
[1:01:31] Circle if you want to but you'll end the
[1:01:33] right back where you where God wants you
[1:01:35] to be you can go in that Circle but you
[1:01:38] can miss all that hurt and that pain
[1:01:40] going in that Circle to get back right
[1:01:42] exactly where God wants you to be so
[1:01:44] that he can do what he wants with your
[1:01:46] life amen see everybody don't have to be
[1:01:49] like Caleb where he said even though I'm
[1:01:51] old I'm still able to go conquer my
[1:01:53] Mountain God want to use people when
[1:01:55] they used sometimes God doesn't matter
[1:01:57] what age and phase you are if he wants
[1:01:59] to use you let him use you amen let him
[1:02:02] use you because he has a purpose and
[1:02:04] what he wants to do with your life amen
[1:02:06] and you never know when the moment may
[1:02:08] come that you might not be able to do
[1:02:11] what he wants you to do amen you never
[1:02:13] know because you go through and say I
[1:02:16] got plenty of
[1:02:17] time there's many people that say I got
[1:02:20] plenty of time that I a't here no more
[1:02:22] amen amen there's many people that say I
[1:02:25] I do it next year when I get a certain
[1:02:28] age but God ain't looking for when you
[1:02:30] get a certain age God ain't looking for
[1:02:33] when a certain time come he not looking
[1:02:36] for when when I feel like it he looking
[1:02:38] for you to move right now when he call
[1:02:40] you he not looking for you to say when I
[1:02:43] get this and this and this lined up then
[1:02:45] I'll do it he he if he calls you now
[1:02:48] move amen move because there's so many
[1:02:51] people that don't move and you see the
[1:02:53] thing that happen to them but you don't
[1:02:56] understand maybe you're not looking cuz
[1:02:57] you don't want to see it amen amen but
[1:03:00] God has a way of calling you that you
[1:03:03] know is God that you know deep down in
[1:03:05] the inside that is God it's not anybody
[1:03:09] else that could call you and tell you
[1:03:11] and something like the woman at the well
[1:03:14] it wasn't no one that could come and
[1:03:15] tell her her story but God and she said
[1:03:18] we've learned that when he come he would
[1:03:20] do these things said you might not know
[1:03:23] but you know it's God calling you listen
[1:03:26] to him cuz he has a plan for you he got
[1:03:28] something that he wants you to do and
[1:03:30] he's knocking at your door and sometimes
[1:03:32] he knocks as some people's door for a
[1:03:34] while but don't let it be a while go go
[1:03:37] and answer that door because it's the
[1:03:39] best thing that could ever happen to you
[1:03:41] it's the best thing that you could ever
[1:03:42] do with your life I've never heard
[1:03:44] someone that gave their life to God that
[1:03:46] their life didn't improve it wasn't
[1:03:48] better I never heard someone that gave
[1:03:50] the life to God that things didn't turn
[1:03:53] out better for him that the living a
[1:03:55] Christian life wasn't better for them
[1:03:57] than where they could have been and they
[1:03:58] would have been and all they had to do
[1:04:00] is look at somebody that was where they
[1:04:02] was in that time of life and they can
[1:04:04] see what happened to them and realize
[1:04:06] that the life that I live is much better
[1:04:08] it's much better it's filled with
[1:04:10] blessing even with my struggles my test
[1:04:12] and my trial it's still much better than
[1:04:15] living where they might have lived and
[1:04:16] done what I might have done and I'm
[1:04:18] still here only by the grace of God
[1:04:20] because he had a plan for my life he had
[1:04:23] something that he wanted me to do and
[1:04:24] it's only by God God's grace that I'm
[1:04:26] still here that I'm living that I can go
[1:04:28] on and I can testify that God is good
[1:04:31] that he's a Wonder workking Mighty God
[1:04:34] that he's a Healer he's a deliver he's a
[1:04:36] savior he's someone that I can go to in
[1:04:38] my time of need and say Lord I need help
[1:04:41] he's someone I can go to when I'm down
[1:04:43] and out and say Lord Lift Me Up Lord
[1:04:46] give me joy give me happiness give me
[1:04:48] peace Lord and sometimes you got to go
[1:04:51] to them cuz you need it it's something
[1:04:53] that you need it's above all and there's
[1:04:55] no one you can turn to it's not friends
[1:04:58] it's not family but you can go to him
[1:05:00] and say Lord I need you I need you to
[1:05:02] show me what you want me to do Lord I
[1:05:05] need you to show me your plan cuz Lord
[1:05:07] if I keep going I'm going to fumble and
[1:05:09] I'm going to stumble but when you show
[1:05:11] it to me I can walk down with joy and
[1:05:13] happiness I can take the test in the
[1:05:15] trial I can go through because Lord I
[1:05:18] realize that it's turning around for me
[1:05:20] I realize that what I'm going through I
[1:05:22] got a different Outlook because I know
[1:05:24] that I'm in your plan I know that I'm in
[1:05:27] your promise Lord I know I'm doing what
[1:05:29] you want me to do and as long as I'm
[1:05:31] there Lord you got me covered Lord you
[1:05:34] got a hedge around me Lord you got me
[1:05:36] and you going to deliver me out of it
[1:05:38] all see David did wasn't worried about
[1:05:40] Saul cuz he knew that God had already
[1:05:42] anointed him and he said don't touch
[1:05:44] Saul cuz he's still God's anointing but
[1:05:47] as long as he's there I'm going to leave
[1:05:49] him alone and even though he might chase
[1:05:51] me see God got a plan in all that see
[1:05:55] God had a plan and a reason say it's all
[1:05:58] there for a purpose and when God get
[1:06:00] through with you you'll realize why he
[1:06:02] took you through why he brought you
[1:06:04] through and you can give him more glory
[1:06:06] and more honor and more praise because
[1:06:08] God is just that good said Lord we want

[1:13:20] um well as y'all know dad Daddy got sick
[1:13:24] near the end of May and during that time
[1:13:27] I was trying to finish up my quarter or
[1:13:31] session for school do certifications for
[1:13:35] my job for um case man a certified case
[1:13:38] manager and so I did I was did my
[1:13:44] cus and for the certification but I some
[1:13:48] of them I did on my work system some of
[1:13:50] them I did on the case management
[1:13:52] website so the ones that I had had to
[1:13:55] put in from my work website I didn't
[1:13:58] realize until that night I start putting
[1:14:01] them we came on to church and I um
[1:14:04] that's the night brother Matias preached
[1:14:06] we got home we couldn't get in the house
[1:14:09] the door we couldn't get in the house
[1:14:11] and I had got kind of frustrated cuz I
[1:14:13] was like manbe we can't get in the house
[1:14:15] we didn't realize K was in the house we
[1:14:17] couldn't get in the house and I was like
[1:14:19] so I got to go and hurry up and put
[1:14:21] these cus in to their system so it can
[1:14:24] count for my
[1:14:25] certification so when I was putting them
[1:14:28] in I didn't realize some of the ones I
[1:14:30] did for my on my job system did not
[1:14:33] transfer over so I was trying to do as
[1:14:36] many as I can 12:00 came I didn't have
[1:14:38] enough cus so I lost my
[1:14:41] certification and the certification is a
[1:14:43] test cost about $400 which my job pays
