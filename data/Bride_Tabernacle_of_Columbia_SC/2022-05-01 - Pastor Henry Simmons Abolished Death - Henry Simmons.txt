father in jesus name we thank you bless your word now in jesus name amen amen amen as we stand for the reading of the word the book of second timothy 1 second timothy is kind of rebounded ii timothy 1 and 6 it says wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not down therefore ashamed of the testimony of the our lord not me his prisoner but be thou partakers of the affliction of the gospel according to the power of god who has saved us and called us with the holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifested by the appearance of our savior jesus christ who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to the light through the gospel god bless you read this word you may be seated we were dealing with quickly in power since uh around the easter time and we were continuing on death is defeated and then we your enemy is destroyed amen so this morning we're talking about death has been abolished he abolished death so why should we pay i mean put special emphasis on death has he has he has not he will do it he has abolished death are you with me that means something to you and i as believers the death has been abolished but to the unbelievable amen praise god they are still dead amen but to the believer death has been abolished in the that death has been abolished he says he brought life and immortality to light through the gospel and the bible says if our gospel will be heard it is hidden to them that are lost on whom the god of this world has blinded the mind of them that believe not least the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god shall shine unto them praise god god wants to shine to somebody this morning amen god wants to sow somebody's delight praise god that's what the gospel brought life and immortality to the light praise god that you can live everybody you praise god nobody wants to die amen everybody wants to live because they value life praise god sometimes folks say well i just want to die but in reality amen they want to escape the bible says the corruption that is in the world amen it's not about dying it says they want to escape they want to rid themselves of what's going on in this world somebody says that death has become our friend to the believer amen death is a friend it's the gate by which we pass out of troublesome vexation of sinful world amen we've had this world is full of trouble a man that is born of a woman a few days and full of trouble trouble all around us amen can't get rid of trouble but death is a gateway amen that we can pass amen to that place of the sixth dimension amen we don't die we go into a better place it's talked about into a world of perfect peace and purity and the powers they all were broken for death does not trump over us but we drop over it amen death does not trump over us but we trump over it are you with me so it's very important that we understand that god amen puts us in position that we can be uh victorious amen that death does not make us afraid we're not scared amen it's only amen our friend to take us where we want to go into that place where god says i've prepared a place for you the way i am that you may be also amen this troubled world and folks are they men are unhappy they're not happy they they living but it's almost like they don't know why they exist why am i here why you know in some folks it's not taking advantage of god's grace and god's mercy because they don't want their eyes to be open they don't know why should my eyes be open i i i think sometimes the christian amen sometimes there's a stumbling block in front of the unbeliever because they said if this is what a christian is all about then i might as well stay like i am amen because they need some light to shine brighter than what they are doing amen but if the christians seem to be defeated and amen don't walk with victory and not enjoying the life and enjoy living amen because when you know the christians ought to be the only ones that's living because amen you say because i live you live also amen the life ought to be in you it's something that look at an old dead rotten tree and then look at one that bad fruit and living praise god it's something that we'll look at wrong i am not supposed to be amen a christian should be a man a fruitful life a life of joy and peace a life that you ought to be salty amen praise god you ought to be something that amen men want to be like i want what you got but if you don't have it amen then folks don't want it and i'm saying brothers and sisters it behooves us as christians amen that god is saved they meant to amen uh take advantage of this great salvation that god has given us amen god it's giving us light in the evening time and amen and you got to realize that the gospel light has shined to you and i not only to save us to bring us out of mystery babylon to bring us out of the the the decrees and dogmas of men to bring us into the word praise god here we were one time in time past deceived by the enemy amen under bondage over uh denomination of men doctrine and men creed but god calls you and i amen to the word praise god hallelujah helping us to understand that there's a word for the hour and the day we live in amen there's a message on the scene that will even enlighten our eyes praise god there's a gospel amen that brings the life and immortality to the light amen praise god here we are brother sister if anybody got it you ought to have it praise god hallelujah the gospel of your salvation i believe paul was uh speaking of a greater revelation than amid the jews and uh amen the pharisees and the sia seeds had in that day i believe he had recognized that god amen has transitioned amen he has moved amen they met from the old testament and and he calls amen jesus to come on the scene and with jesus coming on the scene it made a difference amen the book that they were reading and it was that letter to them but it had become life so paul was bringing out him and that which was prophesied now he's saying it's not prophecy anymore it's reality amen jesus christ amen has wrought the victory amen the hallelujah jesus the messiah has come brother and sister i believe amen as the folks are anticipating the rapture amen they don't know the raptures in progress are you with me they don't know that they're the people in the scene you know amen that are in the third episode of semen praise god the exodus and they're getting out of here amen hallelujah they don't realize something is taken from uh places uh uh the power of transformation lord amen god is transforming him into people even getting the people ready amen and the bride has made her separated his wife had made herself ready brother and sister make yourself ready amen god gives you something amen that you can't be ready praise god god give you the power to be ready praise god hallelujah why because they meant those that were ready they had the x-ray all in the vessel praise god they were oh hallelujah they had fire inside oh god they latched didn't go out they didn't lose the victory they didn't lose their joy they didn't lose their peace they had actually hard praise god at least some folks have lost their victory some folks have lost their joy even but i know that there's a people on there they made the bridegroom coming to that go you ought to meet him amen they say it hallelujah they mean they understood that something had happened in their life praise god they needed more than that they had brother and sister i believe that more is available more than what you had is available you need more all amen then get it why even you can come to him and buy amen praise god him that has the i said amen him that has the oil you better buy why you have a chance praise god how are you going to oh lord let's get down to business with god let's get more sincere amen about our christian walk let's get hold of god in a real way god amen praise god i need more of you lord i need more anointing power quick and power praise god i don't have what it takes to be christian ratchet out of here i need more praise god why amen i can look at my life and i know that something is missing i should be happy i should be excited because amen i know the rapture is taking place amen but the cares of this life the character of this life will wipe you down amen it'll keep you from having victory in your life praise god you'll be more worried about the cares of this life and the things that are happening around you the things that are happening amen and family and home and with friends and neighbors sitting on the job and in the school amen but you need to be amen said lord amen let me look beyond amen these circumstances and condition let me look to amen where my help come from hallelujah i'm looking to jesus amen who's the author and finisher of my faith amen i'm not trusting amen in these temporary things they meant because they meant the world around us amen it's just temporary amen i'm gonna look to the unseen praise god i'm looking to the unseen realm i'm looking they meant what jesus had prepared for them that loving amen because i love the lord i i'm not gonna let these things amen move me so by the grace of god i was saying in mueller's the other night amen your enemy amen the death has been abolished amen your enemy has been destroyed death has been abolished praise god when i said abolish that means to do away with completely to do away with completely hallelujah abolish amen to get rid of death has been abolished and we know that the wages of sin is death again i'm repeating that sin because of sin amen came death are you look man amen because of sin death came in amen and sin was unbelief amen and to not believe god amen is sin and sin brought attributes with it praise god death had attributes that's why folks hate steal amen it's got sorrow and got pain it's got disappointment jealousy injury strife malaysia all of these things because of sin dying hatred sickness all of that came because of sin drinking smoking lying and stealing all of those are the attributes of sin because we were sinners we had all of that working in us but god amen because of sin sin boss for death are you but death amen has been abolished it has been completely amen to do away with sin complete the death completely amen god is good let me take my time and it's something about hebrews 2 here left over brother dwayne in mullins hebrews 2 praise god we're living in a world that people are dying the young people are killing up one another and just a young lady got killed the other day when the apartments and all i said man just every time you look around it's a young person getting killed in columbia south carolina praise god and who knows if we're not if we don't take heave to this gospel we don't want that to come among us isn't that right but god god has given you hope of eternal life god's given you a way of escape if you will only accept the gospel praise god this gospel got to be so good and so oh potent amen that it can deliver you from the power of darkness hallelujah glory to god hallelujah god is doing something and i'm telling you look the gospel is delivering folk hallelujah you want to be delivered amen the gospel is delivering folks amen now it says hebrews 2 and and 7 it says talking about jesus thou has made him a little lower than angels thou crowned him with glory and honor that did uh set him over the works of thy hand that has put all things on in subjection under his feet for in that he put all things in subjection unto him he left nothing that is not put unto him but now we see now we see not yet all things put unto him but we see jesus who was made a little lower than angels for the what crowned with what that he by the grace of god should what i said jesus tastes death for you that you don't have to die praise god hallelujah that's why a saint of god does not who say i will live it and believe it in me shall never die amen you cannot die because you said i'm the resurrection and i'm the life oh god you'll never die why you only sleep praise god sleep in jesus amen praise god hallelujah but by the grace of god let me just go here it says in the 10th verse it says for it became him for whom all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into what the purpose of jesus dying is to bring you into glory to bring you into glory but i you know it's something about what god has done for you and i but it seems as though what god is doing it only i is it's only applicable if you have faith praise god without faith it's impossible to please him amen you got to have faith in the working of god's power amen what god has done for you you got to have faith to believe it the minute you doubt it amen you amen things begin you begin to go backwards but as as much as you can believe amen you can receive praise god you you can walk as long as you walk by faith amen don't walk by sight don't walk by feeling but walk by faith praise god you always walk in victory if you're walking by faith glory to god hallelujah but i want you to keep the faith amen don't doubt god keep the faith praise god knowing that faith is the victory the devil don't want you to believe the gospel remember paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ but it is the power of god and his salvation to everyone to believe i'm glad i'm saved this morning because he's in power of salvation to everyone to believe praise god hallelujah that's what there's something wrong somewhere amen believers got to enjoy jesus amen believers got to learn to let go of this world and all these troubles and all this care and say jesus i enjoy what you're doing for me lord i thank you i thank you every day thank you in the morning thank you knowing that i thank you all the day long cause you're seeing me it's good to be saved brother sister it's good to know that you're saved amen it's good to know that death has been abolished sin is defeated the devil is defeated glory to god hallelujah before he says he became sin for oh he became it became him for whom all things by whom all things to bring many sons in the glory to make the captain of their salvation what perfect through suffering i know the next verse says both and both he that sanctified and they who are sanctified all of one for which cause he's not ashamed to call them one god calls you his brother amen saying i will decline thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i what see that's what we're singing about singing praises because we got to victory singing the praise because jesus even saved us jesus died for us amen jesus has brought us into glory i'm in glory now hallelujah i was in the world of sin but i'm in glory now praise god i'm taking advantage of this glorious trip praise god this transformation this translation i i i've been delivered amen i'm in glory now hallelujah oh god the devil amen don't want you to speak it don't want you to believe it it don't it don't sink deep enough amen that's why it's got to sink deep enough that that it's going to be affected amen in our lives that it can have resolved amen it can have something that will stimulate they meant something that would amen praise god amen the stimulation of the revelation amen has got to become a revelation to you amen it's got to become revealed to you it's got to open up something to you ain't meant to cause you to ruin the cause you don't want ain't meant to press your way because you don't want to praise god it's got something got to hit deep enough something got to shake down in our soul and something got to be real

have it praise god he's available and i can have it all the blessings that come along with him so he says here he says i would sing praises amen it's something that's why we come and we sing praises unto the lord because of what he's done for us amen praise god sometimes we sit and i can't say amen the one that can't sing or drown you out but just go and open your mouth and do what the word said i will sing amen i'm going to do it because the bible said i will sing praises unto the lord i'm not sitting back as a spectator i'm going to sing praises unto the lord praise god hallelujah i'm going to be a witness amen because the devil would hold you like you cannot talk amen like you can i can't sing so i might as well just hold my mouth it's a shame praises unto the lord amen tell the lord i
