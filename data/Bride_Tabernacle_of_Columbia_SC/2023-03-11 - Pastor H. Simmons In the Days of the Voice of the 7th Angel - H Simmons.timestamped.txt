[34:14] that we might understand the scriptures
[34:16] in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you
[34:19] amen
[34:24] Revelation 10
[34:29] the full first we start there
[34:33] first verse and I saw a mighty angel
[34:35] coming out from Heaven clothed in a
[34:36] cloud and rainbows upon his head and his
[34:39] face was as it were the Sun and feet is
[34:42] pillow to fire
[34:45] going out to the fourth verse
[34:48] and when he and when the seven Thunders
[34:51] had uttered their voice voices
[34:54] I
[34:56] was about to write
[34:58] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven Sent
[35:02] unto me sealed up those things with the
[35:05] seven Thunders uttered and write them
[35:08] not
[35:09] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[35:12] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[35:16] hands to heaven and swear by him that
[35:20] liveth forever and ever who created the
[35:22] heavens and the things that a day in are
[35:25] and the Earth
[35:27] the things that are therein are and to
[35:31] see
[35:32] the things that are there which are they
[35:36] in
[35:38] that there should be time no longer but
[35:42] in the days of the voice of the seven
[35:44] Angel when he shall begin to sound the
[35:47] mysteries of God should be finished as
[35:50] he has declared unto his servant the
[35:53] prophet
[35:54] God Mysteries towards will be receiving
[35:59] I was sharing
[36:01] brother Palmer the other day and I was
[36:03] sharing some things down to Mullins last
[36:05] night
[36:07] and uh brother Ernest was
[36:10] to speak with Jeremiah brother and his
[36:12] thank the Lord for
[36:15] brother Ernest amen
[36:17] I said let me just share these things
[36:20] while it's on my heart
[36:22] he said no I got I said let me just do
[36:24] this tonight appreciate you brother
[36:26] Ernest thank you
[36:29] um
[36:32] in the days of the voice of the seven
[36:33] angel
[36:35] now something is supposed to happen but
[36:37] it's he says in the days not just
[36:40] um
[36:42] one day but in the days of the voice of
[36:45] the Seven Angels when he should begin
[36:47] the sound
[36:50] not
[36:52] collectively
[36:56] a group but he
[36:59] shall begin the sound he
[37:02] so he didn't say them or
[37:05] a day but he said he
[37:08] Singler
[37:09] when he should begin to sound
[37:12] the mysteries of God shall be finished
[37:16] and now
[37:18] we understand that
[37:20] the seven angel
[37:23] sometimes people when they see an angel
[37:25] they'll immediately think about the
[37:26] Heavenly angels
[37:28] and um
[37:31] Peter
[37:33] was in jail
[37:35] and they thought
[37:38] and Peter had them the angel had come
[37:40] and opened the doors of the jail they
[37:42] thought they saw his angel
[37:45] and they said it is his name just not
[37:48] really Peter it's his angel
[37:51] and then
[37:53] when the Book of Revelation when
[37:58] there was
[38:00] fell at defeat the worship the one that
[38:03] was showing them the things he said see
[38:05] that I do it not so I'm your fellow
[38:07] servant of your brother and the prophet
[38:10] see the angel that was showing them the
[38:12] things
[38:13] that was written in the book are you
[38:14] with me
[38:16] so we can go through those scriptures
[38:17] but
[38:18] I'm not going to take a whole lot of
[38:19] time but hopefully you understand
[38:22] that
[38:24] he says
[38:25] that I'm not a Heavenly angel I'm an
[38:28] Earthly messenger
[38:30] so that word angel means Messengers
[38:33] and in the seven Church ages there were
[38:35] seven ages periods of time that God they
[38:39] said the seven spirits of God we know
[38:41] God is
[38:43] this one Lord one faith
[38:46] amen
[38:49] and that's just one God
[38:53] are you with me
[38:56] and we don't look at God having
[38:59] seven spirits but that seven full way of
[39:04] God is going to work this one spirit is
[39:06] going to work in a seven-fold manner
[39:09] are y'all with me
[39:12] so
[39:14] as God sent out his spirit
[39:16] at each age
[39:18] and it was to come back
[39:22] from God's spirit was to come back the
[39:26] working of Satan in each age that God
[39:29] messenger comes on this scene
[39:32] and the enemy
[39:35] he's coming but God always has a message
[39:38] to withstand the enemy in each age
[39:42] so God sends her a messenger with a
[39:46] message to come back in every age and
[39:49] Paul in his time he knew and John and
[39:53] the apostles knew in their time that the
[39:55] spirit of antichrist was in the world
[39:58] and they had to fight against the
[40:00] Antichrist spirit
[40:03] and they knew that this day was going to
[40:06] come when
[40:09] things are going to get so terrible
[40:12] that Jesus said that it would be like
[40:15] Sodom
[40:17] and it'd be like the days of Noah
[40:20] so brothers and sisters I think we're
[40:22] looking for Revival but we're looking
[40:24] for somebody and me and brother Fred was
[40:26] talking we're looking for somebody else
[40:28] to bring the Revival
[40:30] the Revival may just come to you as an
[40:32] individual
[40:34] just you
[40:36] as an individual
[40:38] and you might be looking for somebody a
[40:40] old a big group of people to bring
[40:43] Revival but you must have your own fire
[40:47] and you must bring your own Revival
[40:50] when the acts where is the wealth to
[40:52] Revival the officer said you're looking
[40:55] at it
[40:56] and you said where's the bride Revival
[40:58] you got to say you're looking at the
[41:00] bright Revival but you can't say it if
[41:03] you don't feel and if it hadn't been
[41:05] revealed to you and you're not really
[41:08] expressing what the Revival is all about
[41:11] as long as you're looking for something
[41:13] you'll never be that
[41:16] are you with me but when you possess it
[41:19] then you don't have to look for the
[41:22] future to it to come but you must be
[41:25] possesses that's why Jesus didn't you
[41:27] know he knew who he was and he said uh
[41:30] our friend louder this is is sleeping
[41:33] and I go awaken and they said Lord if he
[41:36] sleep he'd do as well
[41:38] he said no no no no no letters is dead
[41:42] and I'm going to wake him up
[41:44] are you with me
[41:46] so when he got there they and he said
[41:49] she said I see my brother again at the
[41:51] resurrection at the last day and and
[41:54] they but she failed to recognize that
[41:56] I'm not looking for the resurrection at
[41:59] the last day Jesus said I am
[42:02] the resurrection
[42:04] so he was talking present tense while
[42:06] they were talking about future tense are
[42:09] you with me
[42:10] so he realized that I don't have to look
[42:13] to the future I am the resurrection
[42:17] so
[42:18] once you know who you are the bride
[42:20] would one day recognize who she is and
[42:23] then the Rapture would take place
[42:25] but you got to recognize that the power
[42:28] to raise Jesus up from the dead that
[42:30] same power should dwell in you and
[42:33] should Quicken your mortal body
[42:35] are you with me
[42:37] but if you don't feel a power and
[42:39] sometimes uh we're distracted by so many
[42:43] things mindful Temptations and things
[42:47] that will trouble us amen but it's in
[42:50] the midst of all your troubles you must
[42:52] know who you are
[42:53] and you must know no matter what greater
[42:56] is he that's in you
[42:59] amen and if God has allowed it then it's
[43:02] for a purpose
[43:03] praise God and I thank God that I have
[43:05] victory over it
[43:07] I'm not going to say that uh this thing
[43:10] is going to control my destiny
[43:13] praise God I said the blood has not lost
[43:16] his power
[43:17] amen God it's just as real as he ever
[43:19] was
[43:21] amen though he allows us to go through
[43:23] tests and trials God is still God
[43:26] he's not weak
[43:28] amen he's just as strong as he was
[43:30] yesterday today
[43:32] and he'll be that way forever
[43:35] praise God so we he has not diminished
[43:38] his power
[43:40] amen this power is still real
[43:43] praise God and his power was so much
[43:45] it's still real in you no matter if
[43:48] Jesus went to the cross and they spit on
[43:49] him Jesus wasn't weak he had the power
[43:52] to call 12 but he understood that this
[43:55] trial was just for the present distress
[43:58] I had to go through this trial amen
[44:02] because cup I gotta drink it praise God
[44:05] because I have a purpose in drinking
[44:07] this cup it's not because I'm so weak
[44:09] that I can't defeat this devil but I
[44:13] have a time and it's written in the book
[44:15] I come to do your Will O Lord
[44:18] and I gotta fulfill scripture
[44:21] and sometimes amen God allows things to
[44:24] happen amen that you might know how to
[44:27] be conduct your lives to keep you in
[44:30] your right place
[44:32] let you be humble amen amen to ensure
[44:36] that you need him
[44:38] I need you Lord
[44:41] I need you
[44:43] praise God I'm Reliant I'm not trusting
[44:45] in my ability I'm not trusting in my
[44:48] strength but I'm trusting in the Lord
[44:51] amen my God is more than evil
[44:54] praise God somebody said if he didn't
[44:56] deliver me out of this fire then I know
[44:59] he's able
[45:00] to praise God I'm not going to bow down
[45:02] and I'm not going to doubt his healing
[45:04] power I know he's a Healer though he's
[45:09] slavery yet I trust him oh I know what
[45:12] God
[45:14] amen his power is not we
[45:16] so I still claim the victory I still
[45:20] claim amen with the stripes I'm Healed
[45:22] no matter what I go through
[45:25] brother and sister that's the way it got
[45:27] to be
[45:28] no I don't know why God didn't that for
[45:30] a little bit
[45:31] but God is good amen
[45:35] now
[45:37] the day that we're living in
[45:40] sometimes we wonder what is the message
[45:42] you heard the word message message
[45:44] and sometimes people are scar they're
[45:48] kind of I don't know what you talking
[45:50] about determin knowledge your message
[45:52] Maybe
[45:54] if we look at Monte car 3
[45:59] some people don't understand message
[46:02] they talk about I'm in the message
[46:06] now
[46:07] the terminologies and we have a lingo
[46:11] that we speak
[46:13] and everybody speaks certain languages
[46:16] and it looks like it's spoken in people
[46:19] or astonished because
[46:21] uh you know
[46:24] each Church
[46:26] you were a Church of God in Christ you
[46:30] have a certain language Church of Christ
[46:31] has a certain lingo uh
[46:35] uh the Baptists have a certain angle
[46:37] everybody again
[46:39] certain Apostolic if it was PAW it was a
[46:44] refuge uh and they different a little
[46:47] amen they've got a little terminology
[46:49] different
[46:51] a little scripture differences
[46:53] amen
[46:55] but
[46:56] you must know in the midst of all these
[46:59] different thoughts and ideologies and
[47:03] separation the Pharisee had a difference
[47:05] from the side of seeds you see
[47:08] are you with me
[47:10] see because the Pharisees believed in
[47:12] the resurrection and they believed in
[47:15] angels but the Sadducees they didn't
[47:17] believe in the resurrection and angels
[47:20] and so forth are you with me
[47:22] so there was a difference in Jesus days
[47:25] and terminology the heurians and so
[47:28] forth people had their own ideas
[47:31] but
[47:33] God sent a messenger in the midst of all
[47:37] these different we were somewhat call
[47:39] them denominational thoughts and ideals
[47:42] and people were you know following
[47:45] certain sex the Roadies the rhodiums
[47:50] and it was different types of pasta
[47:53] lights and you know all different types
[47:57] of it's some it wasn't as bad as it is
[48:00] today you know because we got the house
[48:02] it looked like thousands of I mean it
[48:04] looked like another one creep up every
[48:06] day another ideology you know what I'm
[48:10] saying so by the grace of God but in the
[48:12] midst of this chaos and diffusion of
[48:14] religion
[48:15] then there must be a truth if there's
[48:18] got to be a if there's a false then
[48:20] there has to be a real
[48:21] you cannot have a counterfeit dollar
[48:23] lesson you got a real one
[48:26] amen and you can't have a false prophet
[48:29] listen you got a true prophet
[48:31] are you with me
[48:33] praise God you have to have truth before
[48:36] you have
[48:37] error
[48:39] are you with me
[48:40] so by the grace of God in the midst of
[48:43] all of this terminology don't get caught
[48:47] up on terminology and make that
[48:51] terminology
[48:53] your salvation
[48:56] are you with me
[48:58] I don't get caught up on fire seeds
[49:01] salucida or or whatever these different
[49:05] thoughts
[49:07] because you can identify with a group
[49:13] and all the different groups are saying
[49:17] that they believe the same one which is
[49:20] Jesus Christ
[49:22] every one of them almost if they say
[49:25] they're Christians
[49:26] but you get caught up and identify with
[49:30] the gesture group
[49:32] now
[49:35] and what's wrong with being identified
[49:37] with the group
[49:38] it may not be nothing wrong it's just
[49:41] your understanding
[49:44] your revelation
[49:47] are you with me
[49:51] it was some people that came before The
[49:52] Prophet when you had the prayer line
[49:55] and they were
[49:57] different religions different
[49:59] denominations
[50:00] he said I see that that light he said
[50:05] you're a Christian
[50:08] today if
[50:11] uh
[50:12] folks are saying that
[50:15] if you're not with us you're not a
[50:17] Christian
[50:21] now that's hard because we are able to
[50:24] determine
[50:25] that this person is not a Christian
[50:27] then it would be
[50:29] different from what the prophet said I
[50:32] mean you know when he was here and he
[50:33] said hey
[50:35] you go to this church and oh no it
[50:39] wasn't about the churches whether or not
[50:41] the person
[50:42] identified as a Christian
[50:45] he talks about the blood tag
[50:48] was it the blood been applied
[50:51] let me see your blood tag are you with
[50:54] me
[50:56] so
[50:57] a lot of times we
[50:59] disassociate
[51:01] Folk
[51:03] because we said they're not in the
[51:06] message
[51:08] are you with me in other words you're
[51:10] not a Pharisee
[51:12] um
[51:13] you're in trouble you're not a sad you
[51:15] see you're in trouble
[51:18] brother and sister let's not get that
[51:21] you're not with a polos you're not with
[51:24] cephas
[51:26] you're not with Paul
[51:29] okay so the Believers had confrontations
[51:34] and
[51:35] the days of the Apostles I'm a Paul I'm
[51:39] a cephas I'm of Apollos
[51:41] I'm a Paul
[51:43] Paul says we don't want that kind of
[51:46] going on
[51:47] in the message of the hour
[51:52] this is the message that comes it's only
[51:55] one
[51:56] one planted the other waters but who
[51:59] gives the increase
[52:00] he said God gives the increase are you
[52:03] with me
[52:04] so it was God that gave the increase
[52:07] brother and sister your church
[52:11] your ideology
[52:14] the way you think about it
[52:16] no matter how
[52:18] smart intelligent how revelated you are
[52:23] your Revelation is for you
[52:27] your Revelation does not say me
[52:30] it's for you
[52:33] amen
[52:34] see
[52:36] after when it comes down to Salvation
[52:40] the church does not save you
[52:44] the group that you identify with to
[52:46] don't save you
[52:49] you have only one savior
[52:51] and that's Jesus Christ
[52:56] because you believe a certain persuasion
[52:58] does not
[53:00] automatically gives you the Holy Ghost
[53:03] because you believe that
[53:06] God sent a prophet and you believe that
[53:08] the message is right no no no no just
[53:12] because you say I believe that
[53:18] Jesus Christ gives you the Holy Ghost
[53:23] amen
[53:24] to whomever he will no matter what your
[53:27] preachers say what your pastor say what
[53:29] you think
[53:30] Jesus Christ has control of that
[53:34] brother Simmons don't
[53:37] tell him who who to save and I don't
[53:40] tell him who to heal I don't tell him
[53:42] you know it's almost like healing is the
[53:46] children bread isn't that right
[53:47] well what if God heals somebody that's
[53:50] not
[53:52] then you tell him what to do
[53:55] he said well God didn't heal him and
[53:57] they said I thank you Lord thank you
[53:58] Jesus
[54:00] are you with me
[54:02] what you got no business
[54:04] leave him alone that's God that's God's
[54:06] business
[54:09] God he
[54:10] we don't control what God does
[54:14] I know some people feel like they
[54:16] control what God does but they don't
[54:18] control how God worried
[54:22] amen
[54:24] sometimes we don't understand
[54:28] he's let's just look at it a little bit
[54:30] mardokai 3. behold I send my messenger
[54:35] and he shall what
[54:37] prepare the way before me
[54:41] amen
[54:44] the purpose of the message of the owl
[54:47] in the messenger words to prepare the
[54:50] way
[54:51] he was not the way he was preparing the
[54:54] way
[54:54] are you with me
[54:57] he didn't want you to look up to him
[55:01] for John said he that has the bride is
[55:04] the what
[55:05] is the bride groomed
[55:08] are you with me
[55:10] so it's not so much and so John was
[55:13] interested in y'all looking to him he
[55:16] said I must decrease
[55:18] but he
[55:20] must increase
[55:22] I wonder do you have your increase yet
[55:27] do you have the increase
[55:30] if you have the increase then as it was
[55:35] as eloism went to get a bride for Eisen
[55:40] when she got to Isaac she wasn't no
[55:43] she didn't want
[55:45] to hey Elise what you think about it oh
[55:50] I'm with Isaac now
[55:52] it's Isaac
[55:54] matters
[55:56] thank god you bought me two
[56:00] amen John everybody that left you and
[56:05] they're going to Jesus church now
[56:08] what you think they following him
[56:11] your disciple John said you know how you
[56:14] worried about that that's what I I came
[56:16] to do
[56:18] to introduce him
[56:21] brother and sister but I I think John
[56:25] disciples around fussing about when
[56:27] you're in Father John
[56:29] they ain't falling you no more John
[56:31] they're following Jesus
[56:34] you see what I'm saying but yeah
[56:37] it may seem a little difficult for folks
[56:40] to understand
[56:41] the one that you supposed to be looking
[56:43] to is Jesus Christ
[56:46] are you with me
[56:48] the one that you need to understand amen
[56:52] oh Lord
[56:55] so
[56:58] so to prepare
[57:00] the way before the Lord
[57:03] whom you seek
[57:05] for he should suddenly come to his
[57:08] Temple
[57:10] the messenger was to introduce to you
[57:13] and I
[57:17] back to what Paul Peter and all of them
[57:21] preach
[57:22] Jesus Christ
[57:24] because a lot of times it's the little
[57:27] level the level of the lump and folks
[57:30] are caught up
[57:31] in a system
[57:33] and in church
[57:37] instead of
[57:39] understanding that it's the word that
[57:42] matters
[57:43] it's the word of God it's Jesus Christ
[57:45] that matters
[57:47] but people are so interested
[57:50] in protecting their ideal
[57:55] that's why they killed Jesus they were
[57:57] protecting
[57:58] Moses
[58:00] and Abraham and they thought he was
[58:02] coming against that
[58:05] the god that they was revealed to them
[58:08] was Jehovah god of the Old Testament and
[58:11] God is the spirit and this man being
[58:13] flesh
[58:16] is coming against what we believe
[58:19] in when he is better book he spreads of
[58:22] the Devils something wrong with him
[58:25] so they wouldn't go allow that to happen
[58:28] are you with me
[58:30] so they were defending their faith
[58:34] or what they believe that's what Saul on
[58:36] the way down to the Masters I mean he's
[58:38] going to bound and put him in jail men
[58:40] and women
[58:42] I'm protecting what I believe
[58:46] but Jesus was able to do it for himself
[58:49] right
[58:51] he was able to fight for you and I
[58:53] he defended in a light shine from heaven
[58:57] and he said saw Saul
[58:59] why persecute who
[59:02] thou me
[59:04] amen but Saul thought he was doing the
[59:07] what
[59:08] the right thing
[59:10] amen he was standing for what he had
[59:13] been taught and it was the Bible
[59:17] the one God the Jehovah God and he
[59:20] thought this person who was coming amen
[59:23] and he was actually coming against the
[59:26] faith
[59:28] are you with me
[59:30] I'ma tell your brother and sister except
[59:32] God reveal himself to you as an
[59:34] individual you will be trying to be one
[59:37] that's going to protect God and not God
[59:39] protecting you
[59:43] are you with me
[59:44] you'll get yourself caught up in
[59:47] fighting against
[59:49] folk and instead of preaching the gospel
[59:52] or living a life and in rejoicing in the
[59:55] Lord and getting all your blessing that
[59:57] God gave to you you end up getting in
[1:00:00] mass chaos and confusion
[1:00:03] foolish and unlearned question avoid you
[1:00:07] got a purpose in mind you are oh
[1:00:10] Jesus had his face like
[1:00:13] and he came to die on the cross
[1:00:15] he said I have a baptism to be baptized
[1:00:18] wealth and harmonize straighten until it
[1:00:20] be accomplished
[1:00:22] amen is set his face like a flint I
[1:00:25] gotta go amen
[1:00:27] I'm not letting nobody stop me from what
[1:00:29] I my destiny
[1:00:31] the bride has a destiny has a position
[1:00:34] has a place she she recognizes today as
[1:00:38] a it is it it's terrible it's it's
[1:00:41] rotten to the core but you got a destiny
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:45] you got to know who you are
[1:00:49] let me just go over here uh Malachi 4 5.
[1:00:57] you got a position a place
[1:01:01] and the devil would do everything he can
[1:01:03] do
[1:01:05] you know
[1:01:07] somebody says well
[1:01:09] does God need uh appalling this hour
[1:01:13] does God need a prophet with you got the
[1:01:16] Holy Ghost
[1:01:18] don't need nothing that's the ideal that
[1:01:21] laodicea says we're rich and increasing
[1:01:24] good and we don't need nothing
[1:01:27] are you a fan so the attitude of the
[1:01:30] Christians that I got it I got
[1:01:31] everything I need
[1:01:34] I don't need nothing
[1:01:36] so there's no humility
[1:01:39] Rich High minded heady high-minded
[1:01:43] that's why people are not subject to
[1:01:45] Authority at all
[1:01:47] the world we live in no no humility
[1:01:51] people the world takes on that nature
[1:01:54] those that are in authority on the job
[1:01:57] and the different places and those that
[1:01:59] govern the country and uh they don't
[1:02:03] respect the police nobody people just oh
[1:02:07] goodness
[1:02:08] they just feel like we are at a place
[1:02:11] that they just do what they want to do
[1:02:15] people right
[1:02:17] got a right to do believe what I believe
[1:02:19] and do what I did
[1:02:21] and nobody tells me nothing
[1:02:24] have need of nothing
[1:02:27] are you with me
[1:02:32] so we don't need
[1:02:35] do you think the Pharisees started for
[1:02:37] one moment
[1:02:39] that they needed Jesus
[1:02:46] do you think the science seeds thought
[1:02:49] for one moment they needed Jesus
[1:02:54] so much and so in the layout to see a
[1:02:56] church
[1:02:57] Jesus is on the outside knocking on the
[1:02:59] door
[1:03:00] are you with him
[1:03:02] because
[1:03:03] this church age had put him out
[1:03:08] and we don't realize that
[1:03:11] this is an individual thing now
[1:03:15] it's you and God
[1:03:17] but you don't take the opportunity you
[1:03:20] look at the church collectively in a
[1:03:23] group a collected group and we call
[1:03:25] ourselves hey we the bride of Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ and all
[1:03:28] it's an individual all these people
[1:03:31] hollering and shouting don't have a
[1:03:34] revelation
[1:03:35] they just know when you say certain
[1:03:37] words and identify with that hey
[1:03:40] you know what I'm saying
[1:03:42] but a revelation is something that
[1:03:44] anchors your soul something that changes
[1:03:46] your life the Holy Ghost is revealed to
[1:03:49] you who you are that's why you live the
[1:03:51] way you live that's why you walk to
[1:03:52] where you walk
[1:03:54] that's why you love in spite of Amen
[1:03:57] what folks do to you say about you you
[1:04:00] still love them
[1:04:02] you can't help it
[1:04:04] because that's you that's your nature
[1:04:06] it's divine nature amen
[1:04:09] you see but
[1:04:11] if it's just
[1:04:13] a formality
[1:04:16] formality
[1:04:18] people some of the loudest Hollands and
[1:04:20] Screamers
[1:04:21] if you say certain things
[1:04:23] they're Holland scream

[1:10:18] it's evil
[1:10:21] that's why in the days of Noah you're

[1:10:57] hearts of the children
[1:10:59] to
[1:11:02] to turn and he should turn the hearts of
[1:11:05] the fathers to the children
[1:11:07] John the Baptist did that
[1:11:10] in Luke
[1:11:13] 1.
[1:11:16] and 17.
[1:11:18] Luke 1 and 17.
[1:11:25] Luke 1 and 17.
[1:11:28] are y'all with me
[1:11:29] y'all feel all right tonight
[1:11:32] it's going to be all over with after a
[1:11:35] while
[1:11:36] the Rapture is going to take place and
[1:11:38] people are going to be sitting around
[1:11:40] sucking their lollipop
[1:11:45] and the Rapture take place in every
[1:11:48] say well I thought the Rapture would
[1:11:49] take place for Moses and Elijah over
[1:11:52] there preaching to the Jews and you
[1:11:55] looking for the Rapture to take place
[1:11:57] and is already taking place and you

[1:12:10] the shoes you got in the house you live
[1:12:13] in the car you drive and how much money
[1:12:15] you got in the bank
[1:12:17] and the Rapture then took place
[1:12:20] your soul wasn't that
[1:12:22] important all these other things had
[1:12:25] more value to them
[1:12:28] people valued the right thing the
[1:12:30] Christians those that have set their
[1:12:31] bride say that they loved the Lord Jesus
[1:12:34] and they valued it they would fill the
[1:12:36] doors of the church
[1:12:38] you couldn't get a seat almost in here
[1:12:41] if everybody in the city abroad
[1:12:46] and said they want to go into rapture
[1:12:49] if they're really wanted to go they put
[1:12:52] some action with it
[1:12:56] say you want to go
[1:12:58] and
[1:13:00] sister Robinson say don't
[1:13:02] say don't get ready she said be ready
[1:13:07] don't get ready
[1:13:09] she said the Lord told us don't get
[1:13:11] ready be ready

[1:13:18] the Lord
[1:13:19] don't get ready but be ready
[1:13:23] are you with me
[1:13:25] and if you're not ready
[1:13:27] you know those those things will haunt
[1:13:29] you in that day
[1:13:31] that God spoke to
[1:13:34] a sister don't get ready but be ready
[1:13:38] and you fail to be ready

[1:13:44] when you should have
[1:13:46] been ready
[1:13:48] as I said last night

[1:13:53] you got to have your own fire
[1:13:56] your own lamb got to be burning
[1:13:59] and you asked for some of my art I ain't
[1:14:01] got enough for you and me
[1:14:03] you got to go and buy
[1:14:06] for yourself isn't that right
[1:14:08] it's an individual thing
[1:14:11] and brother and sister don't get caught
[1:14:14] up in crew oh we're in the message come
[1:14:17] on
[1:14:18] that's on me
[1:14:24] but don't just get caught him in
[1:14:26] terminology
[1:14:29] amen and think that you all right you
[1:14:31] can just relax yourself
[1:14:33] and use it to happen but where's your
[1:14:35] life
[1:14:37] what do you stand with God
[1:14:40] how are you conducting your life
[1:14:45] does God still talk to you
[1:14:48] are you trying to do something to tell
[1:14:50] somebody about Jesus
[1:14:55] do you love him
[1:14:58] amen
[1:15:01] Luke 1 and 17 excuse me
[1:15:04] Lord have mercy and he shall go before
[1:15:08] him in the spirit talking about John the
[1:15:10] Baptist he should go before him in the
[1:15:14] spirit and the power of who
[1:15:16] Elijah
[1:15:19] to what
[1:15:23] see now you notice in Malachi 4
[1:15:27] it says and he should turn the hearts of
[1:15:29] the fathers to the children and
[1:15:31] conjunction
[1:15:33] and the hearts of the children to their
[1:15:35] fathers least I come and smite the Earth
[1:15:37] with the curse
[1:15:39] some people say
[1:15:41] let's talk about the two witnesses in
[1:15:44] the Great Tribulation period the last
[1:15:45] part that's their largest talking about
[1:15:50] but it says before the great and
[1:15:52] Dreadful day great and drafted day is
[1:15:55] the Tribulation period
[1:15:58] John the Baptist fulfilled the first
[1:16:00] part of that
[1:16:01] but the last part
[1:16:04] and he should turn the hearts of the
[1:16:05] fathers to the children at least I come
[1:16:07] and smite the Earth with the curse
[1:16:10] are y'all with me
[1:16:12] God is going to Smite the Earth with the
[1:16:14] curse but he's going to send Elijah
[1:16:16] first
[1:16:17] are you with me
[1:16:19] and and God sent
[1:16:22] the prophet
[1:16:24] to get
[1:16:25] look what John came to do
[1:16:28] in 17 he says Luke 1 17 he shall go
[1:16:32] before him in the spirit and power of
[1:16:35] the lies to turn the hearts of the
[1:16:37] children uh the hearts of the fathers to
[1:16:40] the children and the Disobedience to the
[1:16:42] wisdom of the test to what
[1:16:45] to make ready what
[1:16:48] uh people
[1:16:52] see if they didn't hear John they didn't
[1:16:54] receive Christ
[1:16:57] are you with me with all the word they
[1:16:59] had they had to listen to John
[1:17:02] with all the word that Jews had they had
[1:17:05] to listen to Peter on the day of
[1:17:06] Pentecost
[1:17:14] Peter and all the rest of the Apostles
[1:17:16] this Peter said
[1:17:19] by Paul
[1:17:21] he spoke things hard for men to
[1:17:24] understand
[1:17:26] but he said you need you need to hear
[1:17:30] because if you don't you're gonna
[1:17:31] wrestle to your own destruction
[1:17:34] are you a man
[1:17:36] so
[1:17:38] Peter was telling you Paul was given
[1:17:41] abundance of Revelation Paul said it was
[1:17:44] given to me to the Gentiles
[1:17:47] don't you know the church ages are
[1:17:49] dealing with the Gentile church and God
[1:17:52] Amen blinded the eyes of the Jews that
[1:17:55] the Gentiles might be grafting in
[1:17:57] are you with me
[1:17:58] and Paul was to be a light to the
[1:18:01] Gentiles are you with me so we're
[1:18:05] dealing in the church agents dealing
[1:18:06] with the Gentiles but God Don't Turn
[1:18:08] back to the Jews
[1:18:10] are you with me
[1:18:12] and those Jews are going to accept Jesus
[1:18:16] Christ as their as the Messiah
[1:18:19] which they rejected him before because
[1:18:21] God blinded them for our sake
[1:18:25] are you with me
[1:18:27] so
[1:18:29] that's what has happened brother and
[1:18:31] sister but
[1:18:33] we don't feel a need
[1:18:37] of a prophet for this generation for
[1:18:41] this age
[1:18:42] but brother and sister we're in a mass
[1:18:44] without it we in terrible she
[1:18:49] God has he had a voice
[1:18:54] for this age
[1:18:57] and only those that are filled with the
[1:18:59] Holy Ghost
[1:19:01] that had the spirit he said he that has
[1:19:03] the ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:19:06] says without the Holy Ghost you listen
[1:19:09] intellectual
[1:19:12] with the Holy Ghost it's been revealed
[1:19:14] to you
[1:19:16] are you with me
[1:19:18] now folks just taken for granted but
[1:19:21] they have no Holy Ghost
[1:19:24] so when the pressure come with no Holy
[1:19:26] Ghost you're not gonna hold up
[1:19:30] praise God those that seem to be
[1:19:32] anointed but what an ordained to hear
[1:19:35] those that are ordained to eternal life
[1:19:37] bleed
[1:19:39] you got to be ordained to eternal life
[1:19:42] to believe what Paul was preaching
[1:19:46] that's why in Revelation 13 He said many
[1:19:49] as of ordained to eternal life bleed
[1:19:51] praise God you got to be ordained to be
[1:19:54] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:19:56] amen

[1:20:00] bride you will not be the bride

[1:20:08] bride the Lamb's wife
[1:20:12] but

[1:20:16] that's who you are

[1:20:19] the Lamb's wife
