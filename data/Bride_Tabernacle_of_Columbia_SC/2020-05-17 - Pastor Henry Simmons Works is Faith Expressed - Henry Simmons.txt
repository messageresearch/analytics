all for each and every one today and turn it in with us and you better come out to service today we certainly appreciate you can come in so today we want to go to the book of Genesis 22 but before we go there let's just ball in a word of Prayer father in the precious name of Jesus Christ we thank you for being so good to us amen as the song set down through the years you've been so good to us so father we thank you for being so good so father we pray today Lord that you will God to take the word god that you said faith come by here and in hearing by the word of god so lord those that I hear in Lord made faith grab ahold Lord and Lord God made anchor to so God Lord may you O God look upon the sick and the Lord those that are shuddhi and Lord looking find all about the needs of your children Lord bless every homeless every family Lord father bless their heels today God do something for you people for father we need you now these the spirit needs a power what we need Hill and we need the leverage whatever the need talk they you grant him today unless you're worried now in Jesus name Amen the Genesis 22 and 1 and it came to pass after these things that God did Abraham and said unto Him Abraham and he said Behold Here I am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom died love it and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell Diab and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his eyes and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac his son and clave the wood and the burnt offering and rose up and went until the place of which God had told him and then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and he saw the place afar off never ham said until his young men abide you here with the ass and I in the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you if a ham said you come again and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and lead it upon eyes at his son and took the far in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and I did speak unto Abraham his father and said My Father and he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire in the wood the wire is a lamb for the burnt offering and if I am said son my son God will provide and we said this morning God will provide let me finish reading himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and ever ham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound either his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called out called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said him are and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto Him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou has not withheld our son by all this son amen god bless the reading of his word now in the book of James in the book of James the second chapter and the 21st verse we want to talk this morning about works is faith Express and for subtopic God will provide works is faith Express like to tell you that God will provide here in James 2 and 21 will not even have our Father justified by works when he had offered either his son upon all to see how that how faith wrought with his works and by works were faint made perfect now the strip to declared that abraham believed God and because he believed God [Music] Paul talks about the way God looked at things and James talked about the way man looks at things the Bible tells us that we'll save by faith and not of works this any man should boast but it is to give of God now here James said if you show me your faith and I'll show you my works talk to my favorite that works at diet so by my brothers my sisters and my friends amen we heard servant of God says in a man is know his character is known by his works any man is known as character is known by his works another place he said the tree is known by his fruit no matter who is his works prove his character you take a man no matter how good he tries to be if his works are evil all his goodness won't amount to nothing a man word is his characteristics a man that his words is no good then you'll never have confidence in that man because his word is no good now think of that straight now don't let it go over think on the D but if you notice the scripture Jesus if you will say in your heart not in your intellect it never works no matter how much you try to make it work it won't work cause is intellectual and has any but when anything is eternal [Music] and it has no beginning anything with an end and a beginning has a near but you just those things which has no beginning and the only God has no beginning and no end to help the beginning there has to be has no beginning there has to be without God so God has no beginning God had no in the way that God began and where the gaudy eternity had no beginning and Halloween so God is releasing your not my fate our fate will tend to stop please but I have not seen God can take us into eternity is a please the God has prepared for you and I got pleased that he prepared he said don't let you leave in God leave also in me for in my father's house somebody said I need to go to my father's house if you want to go to the father's house did God have prepared oh please that you could go and find rest for your soul there is a place that God wants his people that come to but your words will express your faith if you say you trust and you believe God word then you must put in action what you believe if you say the Jesus is now Savior did you life will show that he is a savior saying you form you see save you from the knife that you used to live that's all works prove that's your faith it's not judge what is coming into your eternal destination for he said heaven and earth pass away but my word will never pass away God why did you turn off because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God I'm going to tell you that your weight in a prayers God will Express what you need did you say you believe God and your life does not produce the same wave he said where I am for you please please please that you can come to that you can have rest for your soul Jesus so common to me will give you rest I'm talking about a soul that neither I'm talking about somebody they might know where they can go somebody said I'll go to the rock I'll go to the rock that it's hard you know hey man a is a place that you can go and when you get in that [Music] but we could not get back to the tree of life because God had put a aegis down the block to way to the Tree of Life he said on the heat of that tree you'll never die I want you to know [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes I said God will provide a me I will listen today I was asked of God to do something that was a very hard thing to do but because ever have new who asks him to do it he heard the voice of God he did not see men eat nor look we heard God speak to us we heard got coal in our lives we can give you rest [Music] I said God will provide in your life I'm talking about speak the Word of God will provide damn about to draw the knife back the kill is only some eyes but what happened God had a ram in the bush God provided and what the hell that God Jesus Christ the Lamb of God that take our place on the cross for God so loved the world that He gave somebody don't believe it but it's still true now somebody don't want to take advantage they got an ear to let your faith and that won't change your life that won't stop you cover nitin adultery that won't stop you for line just saying edge on the church that won't stop you from drinking stealing you can the church God got the power and I want to tell you today there's so many people today thinking that hey man I'm getting back in it but you won't get around they made you got to come in the streaking they met broad is the way to lead to destruction you got to come on and obey God you got to come on and give Jesus your all in all he don't want part of you he want all of you don't want some head he wants your heart God wants your heart we've been given in my head all the time and what is buhdeuce there was a producer believers that had no power no power to live right but if you do it from your heart a may God has prepared a place for you if you do it from the heart you'll see changes made in their life you'll see pebbles fleeing from you you'll see a problem being shocked what you're running for brother what you're running from sister what are you trying to hide come - the one that could help you it's time to come to Jesus it's time to give Jesus your all you know but look what we're saying brother sister as I slow it down for a moment look what I'm saying to you he meant to many of us are tired of in our intellectual faith amen and not believing from the heart but I want to appeal to you it's time amen to do something you said well I believe from my heart well did it produce a mental life he meant that God promised he meant you to have if it did not produce that life then there's something inside of you they meant that you holding on to he meant you got to come to God and you got to lay everything down he meant Ava Hamm was offering up his only son he meant all the son that I got a man he knew that God was evil I'm not looking at what I see I say God will provide somebody I looked around and said Oh father I see the sacrifice I mean I see the altar and we got the wood here everything is beautiful but where is the sacrifice he said God will provide I wonder are you looking around looking at your situation and conditioner are you trusting God or you're looking to God to provide amen they may have acted upon God Word somehow he meant we stopped acting we stopped believing God we thought it was God gonna do it we wanted a whole own into what we had instead of giving it up all we held own and we wouldn't give up our eyes but way [Music] [Music] I said God will provide God will provide I'm so glad that we are serving a god that will he will somebody said I'm not talking about her he meant what somebody else said I'm not talking about what he done for others I'm talking about what he done for me I don't know if God can save you God can keep you and if God can bring you through this then he can bring you through that if God can bring you out a little then God can bring you out a lot how deep you are and how lost you were they may God still can do it I want you to know one day when I was 99 years old one day when my wife was 90 years old I couldn't have a son oh yes you can oh yes you can God can fix it now just stop by here to tell you amen don't give up hope don't don't give up on God let God have David let God fix it for ya they may not song said Jesus I know you'll fix it for you you got to let him allow him to fix it for you who allow him to fix it for you God can't fix it he'll do it for you that you allow him they meant God he was able to do it somebody today he meant look what he done for them is he not the same God today as he was yesterday is he a real God will you trust him we are not guarded will you take him at his word will you say God from the heart I need to live it I need you Jesus I thought I had you but it did not produce a reality in my life I'm still a man was doing the same thing living the same way I joined the
