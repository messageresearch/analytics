[47:08] in this
[47:09] hour all the Temptation things out there
[47:12] to say that you want to live for God
[47:13] amen amen amen amen I thank God for that
[47:16] Matthew
[47:18] 16 you got it say say man 16 and very
[47:22] familiar scripture we'll start at 13th
[47:24] verse we got it say Amen amen and it
[47:27] reads when Jesus came into the coast of
[47:31] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[47:34] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[47:38] man am and they said some say that thou
[47:41] art John the Baptist some Elias and
[47:43] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[47:46] you may be see that I'm going to read
[47:47] down a little
[47:48] further you see Jesus asked them a
[47:51] question a personal question didn't he
[47:54] but then they started telling them what
[47:55] everybody else saying amen
[47:57] come on that's what happens he asked you
[48:00] a personal question but then they
[48:01] started giving everybody else opinions
[48:03] about it didn't they one of the reasons
[48:05] being because they were in doubt right
[48:08] maybe they had some thoughts but they
[48:09] wern't going to share theirs because
[48:11] they wasn't sure
[48:14] amen they wasn't sure amen so but God
[48:19] wants you to be certain this morning
[48:20] amen that's why sometimes he puts us on
[48:23] the spot to let us see where we at y'all
[48:25] believe that this morning amen amen so
[48:28] it says here in the 15th verse he said
[48:30] unto them but whom say ye that I am and
[48:35] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[48:38] the Christ the son of the what Living
[48:41] God come on the Living God this morning
[48:43] amen aren't you glad you serve a living
[48:45] God Amen come on God that's alive not
[48:49] like we say not a painted fire but a
[48:51] real fire amen come on one that can
[48:54] answer your needs right I thank God for
[48:57] that this morning that's what it is a
[48:58] lot of times people they say that God is
[49:01] real they believe in God but you can
[49:03] tell by their actions in the life that
[49:05] they live that they don't even believe
[49:06] it right because if they believe and
[49:09] believed in what God promised them right
[49:12] and that he was who he said he was right
[49:15] it's like in the song We sung that he's
[49:17] most capable right then they go to him
[49:19] with all their heart wouldn't they they
[49:21] lean and depend on him realizing that he
[49:24] is all Hallelujah right he's everything
[49:27] that we all we ever need y'all believe
[49:29] that this morning come on at one point
[49:31] in our life we didn't know that come on
[49:34] but when times got tough hallelujah amen
[49:37] oh Jesus Lord when things got a little
[49:40] hard right and nobody else couldn't help
[49:42] you God showed up didn't he and he let
[49:46] us know that not only am I here for you
[49:48] Hallelujah but I gave you a promise
[49:51] Hallelujah that I'll supply all of your
[49:53] needs according to your riches and Glory
[49:55] my riches and Glory right
[49:57] come on and he never failed it did he
[49:59] that's one thing about him Hallelujah he
[50:02] ain't never fail amen amen and he never
[50:04] will let's look at matth I mean the 17th
[50:08] verse amen and Jesus answered and said
[50:11] unto him blessed art thou Simon bonah
[50:15] for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it
[50:17] to unto thee but my Father which is in
[50:20] heaven and I say unto thee that thou art
[50:23] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[50:27] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[50:30] Prevail against it and I will give unto
[50:32] thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[50:35] whatso whatsoever Thou shalt bind on
[50:38] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[50:40] whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth
[50:43] shall be loosed in heaven then charged
[50:45] he his disciples that they should tell
[50:49] no man that he was Jesus the Christ may
[50:53] God have blessed to the reading of his
[50:54] word this morning amen I I want to talk
[50:57] about the keys to the kingdom
[50:59] amen with a sub with a subtitle topic
[51:02] eyes the seea amen come on it's a very
[51:06] familiar scripture but I believe that it
[51:08] was a lot going on here amen come on
[51:11] that everybody had eyes didn't they but
[51:15] everybody couldn't see could they I
[51:17] believe Jesus told them once he said
[51:19] well then as I prophesy of you that
[51:22] having eyes they'll see not right and
[51:25] having ears they'll hear not
[51:27] seem to be some what a mystery what do
[51:29] you mean I got eyes I can see come on I
[51:32] got ears I can hear and sometimes that's
[51:34] the attitude that people have right amen
[51:37] but you can tell by the very fruits of
[51:40] their life right amen that they don't
[51:42] understand it they don't see it by
[51:43] Revelation right amen and that's what
[51:46] Jesus was talking about here right it's
[51:49] more than just uh from your natural eyes
[51:52] y'all believe that this morning and we
[51:53] coming to that to the hour that we live
[51:55] the hour that we live we coming that
[51:57] you're going to have to be looking with
[51:59] more than just your natural eyes now
[52:01] come on but you're going to have to see
[52:03] spiritual things this morning y'all
[52:05] believe that come on because these
[52:07] Natural Things Are fading away aren't
[52:09] they fading away quickly but the things
[52:14] that are in the spiritual realm
[52:15] Hallelujah are bringing themselves to
[52:17] manifestation now but you got to be able
[52:20] to see what God is doing hallelujah it's
[52:23] nothing like a people that that know
[52:25] their hour of visit ation right that
[52:28] know what God is doing in their hour but
[52:30] most of the time in the world people
[52:32] didn't realize the hour that we were
[52:33] living in did they amen and when they
[52:35] don't realize the hour they won't know
[52:38] what God is what they expect or what to
[52:40] be looking for God to do right come on
[52:44] Hallelujah they'll still just come to
[52:46] church like they always did come on just
[52:49] to hear a good sermon and go back home
[52:50] but they ain't looking Hallelujah for
[52:53] signs and wonders they ain't looking
[52:56] come on on for the power of God they
[52:58] ain't looking Hallelujah for for for for
[53:01] these signs to follow them that believe
[53:03] because they don't know what hour they
[53:04] live in but to know what hour you live
[53:07] in to know that God has brought us back
[53:11] Hallelujah back to the book of Acts come
[53:13] on back to the power of God back to the
[53:16] holy ghost moving again come on and I
[53:19] don't know about you but that's what I'm
[53:21] looking for Hallelujah come on I said is
[53:24] that what you looking for this morning
[53:26] come on I don't know about you but I
[53:28] says when I come to church I come
[53:30] expecting God to move Hallelujah come on
[53:33] I come expecting God to do exceedingly
[53:35] above all that we can ask for think come
[53:38] on when I get down on my knees and pray
[53:40] it ain't just in in just like that but
[53:43] I'm expecting God to do something come
[53:46] on when I call on him and ask him I'm
[53:48] expecting him to answer come on oh Jesus
[53:52] what is your expectation this morning
[53:55] come on come on this got to rise to meet
[53:57] the challenge of the hour now come on
[54:00] thank you them that out in the world
[54:01] they speak and they believe or they
[54:03] speak right come on but what about you

[54:44] everything else done failure you know
[54:46] you have your confidence level here
[54:48] sometime with people right with church
[54:51] right but God allowed things to fail on
[54:54] It come on he allows Church to fail you
[54:57] Hallelujah he allow friends to fail you
[55:00] jobs to fail you Hallelujah that you
[55:02] lose your confidence come on but it's
[55:05] one you ain't going to lose your
[55:06] confidence in come on because he'll meet
[55:09] you anywhere at any time on any ground

[55:15] confidence got to be there right you
[55:17] know I see those Hebrew boys standing in
[55:19] front of the fire there confidence were

[55:38] still able come on I believe in God and
[55:42] I ain't going back hallelujah oh Jesus I
[55:46] trust in God and I ain't I ain't taking
[55:48] it back Hallelujah come on is that where
[55:50] your stance is this morning because so
[55:53] many people turn around don't they
[55:55] Hallelujah so many people give up on the
[55:57] faith right it don't take a lot to knock
[56:00] a some people out right come on but when
[56:04] God is that's why it says he has to do
[56:07] something for you right he asked those
[56:09] that that that was around on that day
[56:11] the disciples who do men say that I am
[56:14] right come on now they all had been to
[56:16] the same Revival hadn't
[56:18] they come on they all had been to the
[56:21] same church services come on they were
[56:24] all on the ship that night when Jesus
[56:26] walked on water right they watched him
[56:30] Hallelujah as he stood on the side of
[56:32] the ship and said peace be still come on
[56:37] they were with him at Lazarus grave
[56:38] right hallelujah look like every Tri and
[56:42] test and everything that was put on him
[56:44] and he made way look like that should
[56:47] have opened their eyes come on but yet
[56:50] they still had doubt didn't they come on
[56:52] somebody with me this morning come on
[56:54] now they were all in the same Revival
[56:56] wasn't he come on but it's I believe
[57:00] somewhere
[57:01] Hallelujah Peter saw something different
[57:04] didn't he Hallelujah he can look back
[57:07] over the testimonies come on consider
[57:10] all the works that God has done
[57:13] hallelujah consider the the the Miracles
[57:16] that he's done nobody else can't do it
[57:19] like that Hallelujah right I believe
[57:22] Hallelujah that you are the Christ the
[57:24] son of the what living God you showed us
[57:28] that you ain't locked up in a book
[57:30] somewhere he showed us that he ain't
[57:32] just a god of History Hallelujah but we
[57:36] seen him in our midst Hallelujah that
[57:38] he's still alive and well come on oh
[57:42] Jesus now all of my doubts are gone
[57:44] Hallelujah come on but Jesus told him
[57:48] Flesh and Blood ain't revealed it did
[57:50] they come on Amen buddy said my father
[57:53] right come on that's what it is so many
[57:56] people they they looking at Revelation
[57:58] thinking they got Revelation because
[58:00] they got a lot of head knowledge right a
[58:02] lot of intellectualism
[58:05] right but that won't bring God on the
[58:08] scene Hallelujah come on all you know
[58:10] and all you can quote won't bring God on
[58:12] the scene amen come on what brings God
[58:15] on the scene Hallelujah Faith right come
[58:19] on without faith the Bible says it's
[58:21] impossible to please God right but with
[58:24] faith Hallelujah he come on the scene
[58:26] and move mountains right so many times
[58:29] he showed us over and over
[58:31] intellectualism Giants come on test came
[58:35] that they couldn't do nothing with but
[58:38] the one that looked like he wasn't
[58:40] nothing right looked like he was
[58:43] some cast away but what he had was
[58:47] stronger than all those giants wasn't it
[58:50] what he had was more powerful than all
[58:52] of the great standards of the people of
[58:54] that day what they had was Faith
[58:57] Hallelujah to believe that God will do
[59:00] what he said he'll do Hallelujah and
[59:02] they stood on it and they waited on God
[59:06] to show up didn't they come on I said we
[59:08] need people today that's going to stand

[59:26] morning God's got to do something in
[59:29] your life come on something something's
[59:32] got to happen in your life to where it's
[59:35] no longer it's more than just church

[59:47] at come on something's got to happen in
[59:49] your life to where all doubts are gone
[59:52] Hallelujah way nobody else might not
[59:54] understand and see it but I see it just
[59:56] for what it is hallelujah but I believe
[59:59] God wants to do that and he's doing that
[1:00:00] every day but do you have eyes to see it
[1:00:04] come on do you have ears to hear it come
[1:00:06] on I know I'm doing a lot of yelling
[1:00:08] this morning but God is good amen come
[1:00:11] on you got eyes to see it you find that
[1:00:15] a lot of times today Hallelujah church
[1:00:18] is packed out right people jumping and
[1:00:21] hollering and screaming right but didn't
[1:00:24] understand the word the preacher said
[1:00:26] Hallelujah come on you say how you know
[1:00:29] that because they go out and their lives
[1:00:31] don't match up to what they shouting
[1:00:32] about right come on their actions ain't
[1:00:36] producing the very life that they claim
[1:00:38] to have Hallelujah why they came out
[1:00:41] they shouting and dancing but nothing
[1:00:43] nothing got anchored down in the soul
[1:00:46] but when
[1:00:47] something sometimes you you sit round
[1:00:50] long enough Hallelujah and the Holy
[1:00:52] Ghost delivers the word to your soul
[1:00:54] then change will come right it'll be
[1:00:56] more than just a jump and a shout but
[1:00:58] it'll be the fruits of the Life coming
[1:01:00] out of you right you'll be able to live
[1:01:03] what you shouting about come on you'll
[1:01:05] be able to walk what you preaching
[1:01:06] Hallelujah you'll be able to produce
[1:01:08] those things Hallelujah why because the
[1:01:11] life is inside of you come on is that
[1:01:14] what you want this morning Hallelujah
[1:01:16] but we find that I says the thing is you
[1:01:18] know a lot of shouting you know but I
[1:01:20] says come on nothing ever changed did it
[1:01:24] come on I thought about that I says you
[1:01:26] know so many was in the crowds when
[1:01:29] Jesus was feeding the thousands right
[1:01:32] they had the healing
[1:01:33] campaigns there was a lot of people
[1:01:35] there wasn't it where were all those
[1:01:37] people hallelujah when he had to stay in
[1:01:41] there with barabus in front of pilot
[1:01:43] right come on where are all those
[1:01:46] Believers that shouted and danced right
[1:01:49] where all those ones that enjoy the
[1:01:52] fruits of the ministry right where were
[1:01:54] the ones that said I go with you all the
[1:01:57] way Lord hallelujah people were saying
[1:02:00] that wasn't they same thing people
[1:02:02] saying today but it don't take much to
[1:02:04] turn them around does it come on don't
[1:02:07] take
[1:02:09] much for people to throw their hands up
[1:02:11] and walk away right but I want to say to
[1:02:14] you this morning God has been too good
[1:02:16] to me Hallelujah he's brought me from a
[1:02:18] mighty Long Way Hallelujah and it don't
[1:02:20] matter to day tomorrow ups and downs I'm
[1:02:23] going still praise God that ain't going
[1:02:25] to change my view Hallelujah come
[1:02:28] on you got to come to that place that
[1:02:30] nothing ain't going to change your view
[1:02:32] come on Hallelujah but God got to get
[1:02:36] you there you believe that come on but
[1:02:37] there's a lot of people right well where
[1:02:39] I say where were they you know one thing
[1:02:41] about it the Bible says many of them
[1:02:44] they were bribed Hallelujah by the
[1:02:46] Pharisees and all no doubt they was
[1:02:48] probably passing out money hallelujah
[1:02:50] amen didn't take much to sell Jesus out
[1:02:53] for right come on
[1:02:56] sold him all right didn't take much come
[1:02:59] on but I it don't matter how much you
[1:03:01] offer don't you know that he owns every
[1:03:03] cattle on the H that's right come on
[1:03:06] don't you know that he is the great
[1:03:09] physician don't you know he is the
[1:03:11] creator of the world Hallelujah that by
[1:03:14] him speaking the world's ref frame don't
[1:03:16] you understand who he is come
[1:03:20] on it ain't enough money Hallelujah that
[1:03:23] can match up to who he is
[1:03:26] come on the one that's got power over
[1:03:29] death Hell In The Grave come on but a
[1:03:32] lot of people sold him out didn't they
[1:03:34] come on don't didn't say much did it
[1:03:36] come on but what it is hallelujah like I
[1:03:39] said they were going to a lot of those
[1:03:41] revivals but they didn't have eyes to
[1:03:43] see did they come on in the same
[1:03:46] services but they didn't have ears to
[1:03:48] hear right come on but I like how you
[1:03:51] read it a little further down uh right
[1:03:53] after Peter told him who he was Jesus
[1:03:56] begin to tell him about how he going to
[1:03:58] get crucified how he going to have to
[1:04:01] suffer Hallelujah when he go up to
[1:04:03] Jerusalem they go Peter yet begin to say
[1:04:06] Lord be you know far from you that ain't
[1:04:09] going to happen right but then Jesus
[1:04:11] looked at Peter and he said you're an
[1:04:13] offense to me he said get behind me
[1:04:16] Satan Hallelujah come on you ain't
[1:04:19] thinking like God think right but what
[1:04:21] it was though Peter Hallelujah had eyes
[1:04:25] to see he still couldn't move into his
[1:04:29] position until the Holy Ghost came right
[1:04:32] come on though you might be gifted
[1:04:35] though you might know what God want in
[1:04:37] your life it still takes the Holy Ghost
[1:04:39] to positionally place you come on still
[1:04:43] takes the Holy Ghost to put you where
[1:04:45] God wants you at come on but so many
[1:04:48] people think that they can handle it
[1:04:50] right they can do it but I said this
[1:04:52] morning I don't know about you but I
[1:04:54] want God to put me where he want me to
[1:04:56] be at how many want that this morning
[1:04:58] come on somebody give the Lord a hand
[1:04:59] clap of
[1:05:00] Praise come
[1:05:03] on come on it's one thing about it I
[1:05:06] says you know what it is come on you you
[1:05:08] got to let God's got to uh uh cancel all
[1:05:11] your doubts come on he's got to can
[1:05:14] y'all believe that this morning he's got
[1:05:15] to cancel all your doubts what is what
[1:05:18] is the the many tools and the many
[1:05:20] things that you deal with and struggle
[1:05:21] with what is it all about because you
[1:05:23] still got a little doubt right come on
[1:05:26] but when doubt is gone Hallelujah and
[1:05:29] faith has took the place of Doubt come
[1:05:31] on then the struggle is over with
[1:05:34] Hallelujah the hard nights that's over
[1:05:37] with now right because you know that God
[1:05:40] is with you all the time right and you
[1:05:42] know that whatever he's bringing you
[1:05:44] through it's just that he's trying and
[1:05:46] testing you to get you out to where you
[1:05:47] want to be at come on you know I thought
[1:05:50] about that it stirred me up I thought
[1:05:53] about that that talking about that
[1:05:54] horseshoe you know I heard listen to a
[1:05:57] theologian he was talking about about
[1:05:59] the Horseshoe and the making of it right
[1:06:01] he was saying that you know that they
[1:06:03] take all types of metal and they and
[1:06:05] they and they bend it and mold it up to
[1:06:07] the how they want it to be right but
[1:06:10] then he says the Horseshoe is one entity
[1:06:12] by itself and then they got the fire
[1:06:15] that's another entity by itself he says
[1:06:18] but when they take that horseshoe
[1:06:21] Hallelujah and they put it in the Fire
[1:06:23] come on and they don't just take it
[1:06:26] right out come on but it got to stay in
[1:06:29] there long enough Hallelujah till it
[1:06:31] begins glowing red hot right when they
[1:06:34] bring it out of the fire Hallelujah not
[1:06:37] only is they they ain't done with it yet
[1:06:40] but they bringing it out and they going
[1:06:41] to beat it a little bit Hallelujah and
[1:06:43] then they going to take it if they need
[1:06:45] to put it back in and put it back in the
[1:06:47] fire a little bit longer right but one
[1:06:49] thing that gots me Hallelujah that even
[1:06:53] though the fire Hallelujah is one energ
[1:06:54] and the horse is one right but when the
[1:06:57] Horseshoe goes into the fire Hallelujah
[1:07:00] it
[1:07:01] absorbs what the fire is come on then
[1:07:04] when you bring it out in this glowing
[1:07:06] red heart you can say hallelujah I saw
[1:07:10] the fire Hallelujah and I saw the
[1:07:12] Horseshoe as two separate right but now
[1:07:16] I see the fire in the Horseshoe
[1:07:19] Hallelujah they some kind of way become
[1:07:21] one hallelujah oh that stirred me up
[1:07:24] come on and I said that's what it is
[1:07:26] hallelujah a lot of people they turn new
[1:07:29] pages don't they and they just come to
[1:07:31] church right come on they read the Bible
[1:07:34] Hallelujah but what it is when when the
[1:07:36] world looks at you Hallelujah they ought
[1:07:39] to be able to see the fire in the
[1:07:40] Horseshoe right come on they ought to be
[1:07:43] able to see the life in you come on that
[1:07:46] they're no longer two but they become
[1:07:48] one hallelujah oh Jesus come on and what
[1:07:52] is the fire all about it's about a
[1:07:54] molding process it's about the bending
[1:07:58] and the breaking Hallelujah that God can
[1:08:01] perfect you and put you in the service
[1:08:04] come on and that's what God wants to do
[1:08:05] this morning hallelujah oh Jesus
[1:08:08] sometimes people want the the the word
[1:08:10] with a flower and bed of ear come on but
[1:08:13] the the word come to try you Hallelujah
[1:08:16] come to break you come on come to set
[1:08:19] you on fire oh Jesus come on don't it
[1:08:23] Hallelujah but what it is it's the
[1:08:25] molding process amen come on God is
[1:08:28] molding you Hallelujah you believe that
[1:08:31] this morning God is mending you but
[1:08:34] people don't want that mening in that
[1:08:35] molding hallelujah oh it hurt too bad
[1:08:38] right then after the molding he gets to
[1:08:41] hammer out Hallelujah then he gets the
[1:08:43] Anvil out oh God I don't want that
[1:08:45] hallelujah oh Jesus but if you don't let
[1:08:48] the the the the the the the Craftsman
[1:08:50] finish the work Hallelujah then you
[1:08:53] won't be ready for service when times
[1:08:55] come right because you wanted to stop
[1:08:58] shorty it hurt too bad come on oh Jesus
[1:09:02] y'all follow me this morning come on oh
[1:09:05] nobody don't know what I deal with that
[1:09:07] it hurt too bad come on oh Jesus but God
[1:09:11] knows exactly what he want to do right
[1:09:13] come on he said cast all your cares upon
[1:09:16] the Lord because he cared for you
[1:09:17] hallelujah oh when he's beating you
[1:09:20] Hallelujah when he's molding you I'll
[1:09:22] get on my knees and say Lord help me to
[1:09:24] to endure
[1:09:26] process Hallelujah help me to endure it
[1:09:30] because God knows what he doing how many
[1:09:31] believe that this morning it's easy to
[1:09:33] say it when the rain ain't
[1:09:35] falling when the storms ain't there but
[1:09:38] when the storm is there and the rain is
[1:09:41] falling can you still say I'mma look to
[1:09:43] the Hills from which cometh my help
[1:09:46] Hallelujah all of my help coming from
[1:09:48] God hallelujah somebody give the Lord a
[1:09:50] hand clap of Praise come on all of my
[1:09:54] help amen come on you know what I said

[1:10:00] Glory your revelation will produce a
[1:10:02] praise in your life amen come
[1:10:05] on your revelation will determine how
[1:10:07] you praising right come on some people
[1:10:11] can't praise because their Revelation
[1:10:12] ain't right right or they can only
[1:10:14] Praise of what they see the next man
[1:10:16] doing Hallelujah but when your
[1:10:18] Revelation is right it's genuine come on

[1:10:29] sunshine in your soul Hallelujah God has
[1:10:32] done something on the inside that the
[1:10:34] hounds of hell can't penetrate come on
[1:10:37] that those fiery darts can't penetrate
[1:10:39] they might hurt this flesh they might
[1:10:41] even hurt the spirit but down in the
[1:10:43] soul that's something that's anchored
[1:10:44] Hallelujah that's something that ain't

[1:10:48] something that even if you go down in
[1:10:49] the grave it'll wake you up one day come

[1:11:45] in only in the things that you can see
[1:11:48] but when God is done something in your
[1:11:50] life Hallelujah then he turns your
[1:11:53] attention to something new hallelujah

[1:13:24] understand what I'm dealing with right
[1:13:26] now but it ain't all in me understanding
[1:13:28] it's in me trusting Hallelujah that God
[1:13:31] is going to make a way somehow it's in
[1:13:34] me trusting Hallelujah that after the
