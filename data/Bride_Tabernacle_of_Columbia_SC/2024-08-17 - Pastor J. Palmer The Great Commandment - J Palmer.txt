power God of souls in this city Lord God we pray for your bride universally Lord and pray God for the ministry Lord Jesus look upon your bride everywhere Lord and we pray God that you just bless our word tonight Lord that you just God to just move me out of the way God and have preeminence oh God we ask these blessing upon the people in Jesus name amen and [Music] amen tonight if your Bibles The Book of [Music] Matthew 22 I believe yes Matthew 22 before before brother Nathan had went to the hospital we was kind of doing a little series upon the very area that he had upon his heart and so we want to just try to share a little bit of those those that Amen in Jesus Christ's name Matthew 22 let's start at verse 26 excuse me 36 22 and 36 here we have the Pharisees then one of the lawyer coming asking Jesus for a questing tempting him and he said [Music] Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him thou shallal love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment amen and the second is like until it thou shallal love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets father bless th word Lord sanctify it Quicken it in Jesus name amen be seated here this lawyer you notice the religious people always brought Jesus questing just to see his respond tempting him in other words trying to bring some type of false acquisition against against his teaching but if you notice he stayed right in the scripture that's it amen here and I believe even so today there the question sometimes you know with us as we call ourselves message Believers no doubt if Jesus was actually is question what is the great commandment today seeing we have the open revelation of the word that God had brought to his people in this hour made known the Mysteries and reveal all the hidden things that were laying there in the Bible but no one could exactly put it in the right place and God by his Sovereign Grace his Mercy ordained that in the last days that he would sent us in Elijah that's going to expound and uh his ministry was going to be a Ministry the for on the second coming of Christ but more than that in his very life we saw the very expression of the love of God and that love that he showed because that was the same thing Jesus showed I believe the Bible say there that for God so loved the the world that he gave his only begotten son what did it it was the love of God the love constrained him to laid down his life something that had never ever had tooken Place taken place before that a man lay down his life for his friends I'm understanding and now I'm seeing plainly that if the people ever can receive that love of God in their hearts I believe all the isms and things will just fade away amen true amen but it has to be the real love of God Jesus said if you love [Music] me he didn't say shout he didn't say use the gifts but if you love me he said keep my what Commandments in other words keep my word this is shown that this love of God that I'm going be talking about tonight can only be expressed expressed through the Holy Ghost you don't know how to love right until you have been born again come on now amen you know how to love fleshly amen and that love sometime gets sour it fades away you turn it off off and you turn it on but it's not really a love it more of affection that love is cruel it's really is really not even real especially as we see it today that that word is used so much lightly a lot of times to be deceptive mostly every young man know that if a young girl ever get told she love them she just her heart just fluttered everybody wants to be [Music] loved but love is something you can't buy amen amen so many people tried to buy it and when it's bought it can be sold am but God paid a price that nobody else could ever pay am and he didn't do it selfishly he didn't do it for any kind of glorification to uh to get some great honor but he did this because he loved us I thought about that so there's no greater love God be the Ser of God say Jesus was God love token he came to express that that love that God had for us am so many time I use the thought I say a lot of times people look for love all in the wrong places what we call cute and what we call this and God said that's foolishness cuz see real love won't do anything to harm you amen amen amen amen young sisters young Brothers when you ever hear that word about I love you it won't do nothing to harm you or to mess you up to take advantage of you amen amen real love won't do that Serv God said love is the greatest Force there ever is real love he said nothing can take the place of that so if you're looking for love call on Jesus amen amen he knows how to love you I thought about that woman in the in the Bible the woman at the well that had the five husband and she was with the sixth man she was looking for love that's why she married married five times she was looking for it all in the wrong places so because of her understanding of love she thought that hey maybe this is the one but look what she went through to try to get to the point five marriages and then decide to live with the Sixth Man so when she met Jesus at that well she said here's another man but this man did not come looking for anything from her he came to give her something amen amen amen amen and that's what Jesus even doing today he's coming to give you something something that can hold you and can keep you even when you you can't keep your own self when you weak he gets stronger amen I believe the bible say that God is able to keep that which you commit to him amen amen and when you fre commit yourself to God God will keep you young people amen so many times that's what the times that guess the young people you know run to the world because they're looking for love they want somebody just to be able to show them some kind of affection that they you love me but then because they don't fully understand the real meaning of it and what this world done with that word love made it more of a commercial feeling you have for someone that you are physically attractive to but there is no Beauty to be desired in him oh my and what God has for you young and old people nobody on this Earth can ever give you the things that God can give you amen every one of us want life we want a more prosperous and blessed life if you want that seek God amen amen the great commandment we call it no doubt if we our little terminologist when it comes to the things of the word and uh the message of the hour especially we ceriz what we call Great the opening of the seals and the Thunders and all of those things but no all those things must be governed by love if love is not the center because God is love amen and love that is not puffed up love is kind it's longsuffering and love is not partial go let me go to another scripture Matthew five we talking to brother Nathan and I was just sitting listening to him I didn't even interrupt him what he was saying I just want wanted to get more on what he was saying cuz I know that Lord had already had me to start dealing with this at the church Maran trying to get the people to real genuine love of God in their hearts amen cuz see it has to get in the people's heart and only through the Holy Ghost love will cover a multitude to of sins not that we pity sin but love covers it that's what Jesus did for everyone here tonight amen in the Old Testament you know they never could get rid of their sins they it was only covered up through the animals and you know the sheeps and things of that nature only a type but when Jesus came he didn't come to cover up amen come on now he come to take it away amen no more yearly sacrifice once and for all he settled the sin problem what did it it was the love of God that he had for us amen lot time people want something deep brother when I saw that this is deep cuz it's something can't be imitated amen amen come on now amen you know when it's real love amen amen in the natural when a young man and young woman get attracted to one another you know they may have never even known I ain't going to use I thought about brother Mack love at first sight it wasn't no question and is proof after all these years he's still right there see love binds you together it's not so much of a physical attraction young people please get that out of your head don't little pretty eyes and pretty hair and all of that pretty stuff going to be gone and when you look over there it better be love lover cause you to go through things together amen I believe really test of L when the trials and the test has come can you still stay there am you know this generation here they ain't going to take nothing if it get tough if it get too frustrated I'm gone but real love you understand that the vows that you took was before God to death now PA One play what shall separate us from the love of God disagreements money this and that no no no Paul saying all these things we are more than conquerors through Christ that loved us oh my that real love really knits you I'm talking about your love for God tonight tonight I believe I heard the servant of God say if I don't have one gift in the church just let love be in the church amen amen amen love will produce gifts he said love will cause a miracle to happen he said love cast out Devils I understand that before you can help people in this hour they got to know you care about them that you love them them not love the church and love the rules and love this no no love them amen amen amen and that mean loving them in spite of whatever situation they may be in you can let them know that the love of God still is able to take you out of that situation amen amen oh my what we need in our churches what we need around this great M of the hour is the love of God but we are so focus upon the quotations and the Deep things they we call it deep the high you know uh but I I understand that Jesus said it's the little foxes that spoil of f not not the great thing we we can pretty much well remember that but we can't produce that love of God in our hearts see can that come through the Holy Ghost and a lot of time what is the real problem is the people have not been born again yet you can't tell me Holy Ghost Born Again people don't love coming to church they don't want to do that which is right lover constrain you to do right no preacher don't have to make you or or keep telling you do this do this no your love for God because he love you first amen amen if you want to show God you love him keep his word amen amen amen be faithful to God and God is the word amen amen go I I've never seen it fail of you you can't outdo God when in your faithfulness amen amen and sometime in being faithful it hurts cuz you go out of the way not just you go two [Music] miles one thing I learned early anything that you do for God give it all you God amen amen I don't like this half doing something you know if I'm going to do it I'm going to give it all I got I might don't have much but whatever I got I'm going to put it all there seez I done been on both side of this thing I know what that other side come with a being out the world ain't doing the things of the world and when you are in the world you going at it uhuh time don't even stop here amen it doesn't matter how late of the night it is you going amen but we come to church don't go too long Brother s you know the prophet said belov there used to be a time but remember that when we had Church plus 7 time did not matter why because the people were in love with God school work didn't care why because their love was so real for God they were stirred about God and God came down and met needs and Pillar of Fire the supernatural because the people love God if only we can get the people back to that kind of frame of mind that well they not worried about work and making money but they concerned about this might be my last time to get a whole of God so I'm going to give it all I got tonight oh my tell them back home I said we have so many excuses why we can't love God but Jesus nailed them all to the Cross we without excuse look like with all that God has made known to us we ought to be so such illuminated by the spirit of God that we'll be waiting until somebody open those doors that people fall in love with prayer oh don't talk about that brother that when people understand that their prayers mean something amen amen amen amen prayer set the tone for the whole service amen amen and the Ser God said come early come early he must have said come late why to get in the you atmosphere with God amen amen we talking about a Revival and I'm heading toward that next on another series but I'm haven't even finished this series here cuz you never can over about love and how important it is for you to fall in love with God see nobody can fall in love with God for you you got to know how good God really is to you amen amen and I want to tell you every one of us know whether you don't I'm going going to remind you he's good every day amen even though you may don't understand but understand this somebody is watching over you every day and he's protecting you every day he is healing your body every day he's keeping your mind every day Hallelujah when the devil tried to set tracks for you God is your protector amen amen amen come on you may not be like my people but I want you to know God loves you amen amen see let let's get our mind of what people think of us as long as God love [Music] me a lot of times in school and different places people want to be accepted by groups got defe that this group is a greater group come on God got a love that surpasses all of your understanding am you want a friend Jesus will be your friend amen let me tell you something and he is a friend at all times come on he's not just a a friend as long as you do what him won't like AB Brothers do as long as you do what I want you to do you my buddy but when you don't want to do what I want you to do then you ain't nothing my friend I say a friend love at all times a good friend will even tell you when you're wrong hello have you ever had a friend that tell you when you wrong that what a good friend to do brother you're wrong sister you're wrong that's what no good friend go well they shouldn't did that no no no they shouldn't did that to you because you no no no you wrong how many friends you got like that that you can tell them when they're wrong or we don't tell our friends when they're wrong when we should and they trying to get you to do something that's right no that's wrong and I'm not going to be involved in anything like that that what you going to do I'm some suppar myself see love will cause you to separate from all evil too love won't allow you to keep company with ungodliness amen we love people because of material things Matthew 5 I'm closing 43 through 46 ye have heard that it had been said thou shallal love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that do what do good to them that what hate you and do what pray for them thatp use you and persecute you Lord have mercy amen how are we going to do that how are you humanly going to love them that despitefully use you and say all manner of evil against you can I read y'all something this is in a footnote here it is by loving your enemies loving your enemies is one of the greatest statements Jesus ever made the love en joying In this passage is love that originate from God himself other words you will not be able to accomplish this kind of love except God dwells in you because to love somebody that do you wrong it don't make you feel good and you know they deliberately did it to you and here Jesus said love them anyhow do good good to him I'm going tell I believe that this is to me you talk a great if we could ever get the people of God with this message to learn that you know that we shouldn't hate no one though you may disagree with them that's all right but you know how we get this little funny feeling and somebody done done something and we cross the street when we see him or we turn our our back like we don't see him that's the time you ought to go speak to him personally why cuz you will kill that spirit amen amen amen you will kill that spirit because if you get anointed with that little you know discomfort spirit and you ain't did nothing wrong but then what you running from them from amen amen amen why are you dodging if you are to praise the Lord sister Ser God say how to be such a love amongst us because nobody can love like this except the Holy Ghost is in them amen we are confessing the Holy Ghost I mean the real Holy Ghost Ser God said what are the evidence of the Holy Ghost is love amen let me finish that passage cuz it's more love your en do good to the pr okay 4 to five that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and S to rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you that this is way we get in problem if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same see it's easy to love them that love you are that ACC company accompany himself with you as a friend but that's not what God is talking about here we must learn how to love the unlovable the servant of God said you can should be able to bitterly disagree with a person but yet be able to love them before you even had a disagreement the same you should be able to throw your arms around that sister and brother don't you disagree with it it's okay to disagree but we're not told to hate most of the time we disagree because there's something we know that is wrong about what a person is doing Amen in love is correction amen amen but you it's hard to correct grown folks in this hours amen Christian folks you know they'll leave church try to correct me the Bible say if you can't take correction every one of us God has to correct us and a man say he don't never do nothing wrong you better run run fast it's like the man of God say they had that racer went into a job and he didn't had no R race on his he said sir said your pencil don't have uh no Ras he said why don't you he said everybody he said because I don't make no mistakes he said you won't be doing nothing you got to get out of here I can't use you we going to make mistakes amen we going to fall short but God's grace amen amen is able to pick that up even in your faults your shortcoming that don't Cast Away God love for you it let us know we need God no more amen amen amen there there hour that Christians need God no more I've never see it now on the scale that people so unstable you know why because the love of God the love of God shared abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost want to teach you how to love them that don't love you amen amen amen disagree this all right but you still loving them amen amen but it's so easy for us to get the wrong interpretation oh brother you love me don't you say nothing about what I'm doing wrong no that is not correct if I'm your brother if I'm your sister we all sometime need to just have to correct one another Amen in a loving way amen not arrogant in time pass let me tell you what we done we almost throw them into the Lake of Fire and we'll call them serpent seed and all kind of foolishness because they're not up to your expectations but if you look close enough you'll find out you're not up there either cuz if you had the right Spirit on you you would know how to go to your brother in meekness amen amen and then the Bible say those who are spiritual there do [Music] what yes I had a scripture go you spiritually you should be able to go to the weak the strong are to Bear the infirmities of the weak amen why because that we understand that we were like that one time you wasn't always where you at now amen that's why you ever now to lend a helping hand to somebody that's falling down or falling away you know how to go to them with love and say sister it's going to be all right amen amen amen just don't stay there amen amen give them your right hand and bring them back into the F don't let them just well I know she should have never did that anyhow you worse off than she is you know we got so many super duper duper spiritual people around this message I'm a little afraid of them they're so spiritual intellectually but when it come to producing the very literary life of God and letting love through fall through their heart can't do it I didn't even get to first um 1 Corinthians 13 Paul said you can know all Mysteries have your body to be burned he said if you have not charity he said it profit you nothing you can know all the Mysteries Lord have mercy and don't we know the Mysteries but have not charity amen which is the bond of perfection love oh my Ser God say even the worst sinner know when you love them amen amen they know well they can feel that he said even animals know when you love them sometime we you know as people human beings you know our nature when things come about especially when animals all we be we get scared first and don't you know an animal can pick up your sphere and that that's why he bites Serv God said he stood there before lions and and different animals he said he was so close he said they could have actually killed me but he said but they knew I love them I wish that we can love one another so much that in spite of what one another might do or what might happen to them that we can still say you still my sister and I want to help you if I can maybe I can pray with you to encourage there one scripture I'm not going to even read it I'm going to just quote it for you in Jude 1:21 it say keep yourselves in the love of God keep yourself I told one brother I said you know we you want to help this one I said first you got to get help and when we can get this love of God so in our hearts then we can share that we can spread that love of God in Ephesians 3:17 said Christ the Welling our heart said Let It Be rooted in love let the Holy Ghost Let It Be rooted in Love Inside of us ought to be love so rooted for God first so God said he said he said God ought to be first above everything we do amen amen everything God ought to be first when we take inventory let's see and look I'm not going to evention where God is in your life is he really first after I get a career after I get a wife after I get a husband after but you don't to know what's going to happen in that process cuz God don't want to be second to nothing amen amen he say Seek me first amen amen not not careers not husband and wives if you want of those things seek God first amen oh my and he said everything else to be added amen amen to you amen the greatest commandment your love for God my love for God I believe you get a people to come to church with that love of God in their heart the supernatural break out Miracles will automatically take place because the love is love that does it love heals God bless you tonight [Applause] [Applause] praise God appreciate the word tonight amen amen love amen amen all to motivate you amen all to cause you to examine our cause us to examine ourselves and see whether we be be in the faith amen so by the grace of God we thank God for brother Palmer and appreciate the word I want you to know that we on high alert it's a very serious time I don't know whether you've seen the Ukraine going into Russia if you hadn't you know don't know about it then the prophet had seven Visions in 1933 the sixth Vision we saw a woman even to be president or vice president and he saw the Catholic Church rising up in America so it's it's twofold we got to already got a woman Vice President we on the verge we might have a woman president the seven Vision was he saw the Russia blowed up America and the soldiers was was ravaging the women now this invasion in the Ukraine they're saying that America and its allies are all behind that and he was talking about nuclear war Putin at one time it's kind of quiet and it's breaking out we in the serious hour the earthquake that hit Japan and then came on hit Cal Los Angeles 4.4 or something shaking Cal Lo Los Angeles up Prophet said he saw Los Angeles going and you know if he saw an Invision form and never fail so I'm saying where are we it's going to be a test those that don't believe that God sent a true prophet in this age it's going to be tested will they wake up when it's too late or will you be serious and realize that God has sent a prophet to warn us of the oncoming storm but yet we are not taking it serious true coming to church going in and out if you know at any time the bombs could fall you know I I I don't know do you think Russia ever thought Ukraine would do that and you think do you think within yourself that there's not going to be retaliation and if it is is where do you stand tonight if they retaliate where do you stand with God are you ready for the consequences you know we can lift our head up and jeriah said the Babylon the king of Babylon is coming is coming he was smacked they slapped him nothing going to happen are you with me yes sir and we got a message to tell us what's going to happen but if we say you got to get serious with God people why because we we think we so secure because we a message Believers or we got a pro it ain't about that it's whether or not you're taking it serious what's the purpose of it that you get serious with God and realize you can get ready warning before what Jud judgment we've been warn now when judgment hit you and say well I I had all in my vessel and then you left here with all this chaos and bombs falling and all this earthquakes happening and you're left here behind said brother Simmons why you tell me brother Palmer Ernest why y'all didn't say something why y'all y'all didn't y'all didn't War us y'all didn't y y'all Y y'all just didn't tell us right y'all should have told us that that's the purpose of God sent the prophet to warn us but but why y'all didn't put no more emphasis on it what's wrong with y'all should have put more emphasis I'm telling you the Bible says study to show who Okay approved to who a Workman needed not be ashamed it's up to you to take your Christian walk seriously it's up to you to know that you got the Holy Ghost he said that the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it should also Quicken your mortal body God bless you I don't want to take this but I I told him last night you got to take this serious it's going home time but who's going to go who's going to go you can get caught up with all kind of little cha as brother Palmer say you can get caught up in alll oh so and so don't like me this and that I said see I forget about all of that stuff it don't matter brother Nathan said when they say he had deceptive and everything was going down all this body parts was function was shutting down he was crossing over he said I was crossing over brother Simmons he said nothing but perfect love can get there I just got to have perfect love he couldn't hardly talk but he said you got to have perfect love just forget about all of this just love one another tell everybody to love one he's crossing over tell everybody to love one another nothing but perfect love are you with me amen if you don't have that perfect love the only way you can have it is through the Holy Ghost to love God with all your heart God will fill you with the Holy Ghost if you surrender to his love let us just stand we won't have to call prayer [Music] meeting we won't have to call prayer meeting if the bombs start falling and the Earth start shaking we don't
