thank you for the willingness oh God and the mind oh God to do right Lord we just thank you we love you we appreciate you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and [Music] amen God is good amen I said God is good we want to look at the Book of Numbers by the grace of God numbers 13 a very familiar scripture [Music] I said I always feel like you know like Jacob and I was looking at that again the other morning and how he was praying he was asking God he says you know I ain't worthy of the least of you know your mercies but he says God you know you promised me just summ it up that you chose me and I just I know I ain't worthy of the least of it but I thank you for it amen I feel that way all the time that we ain't worthy of the least to God mercies sometimes we feel that as though you shouldn't feel that way but sometimes as a person might feel like God owed him something but God don't owe us we owe him everything only thing that we can give him is our praise for what all he's done for us amen numbers 13 by the grace of God if you got it say amen amen we'll start here at the at the first verse and it reads and the Lord spake unto Moses saying send thou me that they send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man everyone and rul among them you may be see it go down a little bit further amen down drop down to the to the we'll skip down don't read a whole lot we'll look here at the 21st verse you got to say amen and it reads so they went up and searched the land of the Wilderness was in to Rayo as men came come to hammoth and they ascended by by the south and came to Hebron where a hon shishi and taline the children of an were now Hein was built seven years before Zone in Egypt and they came into the brook of es escol and cut down from then a branch with one cluster of grapes and they buried between two upon a staff and they brought up the pomegranates brought of the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called The Brook escal because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from then and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and Aaron to all the congregation of the children of Israel to the Wilderness of pan and to cadesh and brought back word unto them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and told them and said we came unto the land will thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great morever we saw the children of anic there the malachit dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and jebusites and amorites dwell in the mountains and Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb's steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it there a land that eateth up to in heav thereof and all the people that we saw in in it are men of great statue and there were and there we saw the Giants the sons of anic which came of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so were we were in their sight may God bless the reading of his word again tonight by the grace of God just for a moment I want to minister on uh the Enemy Within amen the enemy from within amen you know I was sitting here and I just kind of been ministering on this for a little bit now taking it from several different angles but I say you know we know that I said a lot of times great kingdoms you know fail and they didn't fall necessarily from their enemies without but a lot of times they fail to fall Started From Within they started you know fighting amongst each other from within and next thing you know some of the people from within probably started you know going along with the enemies and all but the fall would have never happened if they would have stayed together unified but the the the the fall fell the fall began from within amen so a lot of times you see that I was talking the other week and you know the prophet of God was saying about you know uh how how how gossip is in the church it's like seuic acid it'll eat a church up right it'll destroy a church and sometimes even the stuff that says might not even be true or you know just going over that but I don't want to talk too much about that tonight but I just says you know there A lot of times if if the people would stay unified then the Devil Couldn't defeat them but what happened s with is I always say you watch and the devil's tearing up somebody else home and you watch and don't pray for that family or don't pray for them but just talk about them or certain thing I say is when the devil get done with them he's coming to you next but we look at it you know as we fighting this fight together amen y'all believe that tonight we're not like in in it's an individual Affair your your walk with God is an individual but when I say we fighting because you know we are the bride of Christ we are the people we the brothers and sisters of of God right so when one is going through that ought to hurt you right when one child like we always say if one child is is is is uh being the devil is tearing up their life or having effect on one child that it's not that you say that this is this these that family's child or that child but we look at it as these are our children amen because it's the truth y'all believe that amen come on one member of the body hurt the whole body hurt amen right the pinky the hand however we say it sometimes but I said we we in an hour right now where we can't afford to fight one another anyway amen because we got too many enemies too many demons to fight put it that way right so it's a Praying time I believe that with all of my heart it's time that if you ever need to get in contact with God now is the time amen but we find that like we say the enemy from with think or we find that a lot of times like we say we look and wor about those without but we want to deal with what's within tonight right your greatest enemy like we always say is yourself amen you are your greatest enemy amen you are the reason why you ain't where you should be in God right sometimes say oh because of this and that no if if you desperate enough you'll find a way to get to God amen amen if you desperate enough right if nobody else comes to pray with you if you when you desperate enough you'll Pray by yourself amen when you desperate enough when you really need God when you come to the conclusion or or the wit that I need God come on I need him for my when you get desperate enough it don't matter who comes who goes who's who's going to go the distance which is you going to go because you know when you're desperate amen now it becomes between life and death to you it may be natural death but I'm talking about death of the Soul tonight come on where is your Eternal destination right sometimes you got to rustle you got to find that out but I says you are your greatest enemy right we say that tonight I say you you are your greatest enemy but a lot of times like I said is that you know we don't realize that but God has to let us step back and see that right come on he can't it's time now we don't put the blame on on everybody but that's always been man's way to point at somebody else come on we can talk go all way back to the Garden of Eden and how Adam pointed at Eve Eve point at the serpent it's always to point at somebody else but you know I God loves the man that that acknowledges his transgressions amen come on that was key in in in in David's life David was a man after God's Own Heart but one thing that was key about David I said it like that was David didn't mind admitting that he was wrong amen he didn't mind admitting admitting I'm said that he messed up amen right when his sins was brought before sometimes he could have just been caught up in the moment but when his sins was called out he didn't get upset when Nathan did he amen come on now he didn't but he acknowledged his wrongs didn't he amen and he laid before the Lord and he began to repent and say Lord create in me a clean heart because it was that was key in his life he was willing to acknowledge his wrongs right what's wrong today people can't acknowledge their wrongs amen can they come on you say what if a prophet did come tell me well I want to say you know a lot of times the minister of the Gospel getting up preaching you know if he's up there preaching something that he knows what's going on just to Target people like the prophet of God said he got no business in the pull pit anyway amen amen but when that man don't have a clue what's going on but he gets up there and just preaches the word amen come on then what it what is that that's God right speaking to you giving you a word now are you willing to acknowledge your transgressions amen come on cuz you your worst enemy tonight right I was telling teaching the young children the other day I said you know one thing about it I says you know uh you want to live your life in a way to where you want to please Mom and Dad and that's good you ought to do that I says but one thing I want y'all to understand this when Mom and Daddy came see God is watching all the time amen that goes for the children for the adults or whoever you got to you got to understand that everything is naked and open before God Amen come on ain't nothing hid before him amen sometimes you know I was thinking about certain things and I say one thing about it you can't get away from God now amen come on God's got God's he knows exactly what's going on with you and then wonder why Lord why the well stopped up why I ain't being blessed come on you know why you ain't being blessed you your worst enemy amen right you your own enemy God don't want to know why I ain't blessed God didn't told you why you ain't blessed amen you know why you ain't blessed God ain't going to overstep his word get in line with the word and you'll be blessed amen come on is that right amen it's the truth come on now we go through sometimes I believe that for a season God will take us through amen but one thing about it when God is taking you through when it's in a righteous way come on then you don't have nothing to worry about amen come on because that's God taking you through and after you suffered a while come on God is going to bless you I'm a living witness that God will bless you sometimes you wonder wait Lord why you don't bless Lord but you say but you know what nevertheless I'm going still walk up right in God's eyes amen nevertheless I ain't going to charge God foolishly amen you know all his blessings that's just his mercy and Grace that he gave on my life amen come on Amen Hal Hallelujah so I ain't going to question God why I don't have and why I'm just going to thank God and if God see fit he'll bless me amen come on Amen and I know one thing he will bless you because you his children and he won't let you la for nothing hallelujah amen oh Jesus amen amen come on Amen you know I was thinking I says one thing about it you know I I just don't I just ain't worrying no more amen like worriation amen I ain't doing that no more because one thing about it if it's God's will that's right ain't nothing we can do with it amen whatever God's will is it's going to come to pass amen whatever footsteps God ordered you in you got to walk in them amen hallelujah amen God's way is his way whatever you know what I say I ain't worri no more God whatever your will is amen God I want your will you know God's will I I said says the thing about it we can't hinder God's will amen God's got a I was thinking to myself I said God's got a a weird we call it weird but he's got a a a a unique or I forget the word I was saying thinking to myself but he's got a way of delivering us right that's unorthodox that might be the word I was thinking about if that's the right context peculiar that might be a better word he's got a way of of delivering you right amen and and the way God always done it never came to the way man thought it ought to be done right am amen come on God's way the problem is we've been in God's way too long amen until you get out of God's way Master like they say human ability get out of get out of God's way and realize that I can't do it anyway amen come amen amen I can't make this journey on my own anyway once we realize that amen hallelujah amen then that's when that's the right atmosphere for God to come in amen when you see yourself that way then God can come in God's Got A peculiar way of Deliverance right amen come on I said I ain't I ain't I was looking up something your mind I want to read it about worriation come on I I said I ain't wor no more about nothing something might catch y'all surprise but I know one thing if it's God's will come on Amen I just want to live in God's will amen I was sharing with them the other week I said the boys was was picking at me about all my gray hair I got right say you'll be all white by the time it's 45 or whatever but I say you know what I'm living this life so I can live again amen amen I ain't worried about this life amen this body I want to please God Amen and I want to do us all in pleasing in his sight amen but I says that I'm living this life right now so I can live again amen come on Amen I says I'm I just I told him I'm just trying to make Heaven my home amen right one of the boys in the background he said well Ernest well since you ready to get to that place won't you go ahead and go I started laughing I said you know I ain't rushing the time but I know one thing that's going to be a glorious day that one day come on y'all believe it talking about a place where there's no more pain no more sickness no more heartache come on none of that amen come on but we got to get there and it's a press to get there but I'm willing to press I say God just give me strength I'm willing just give me the strength to do it amen am come on yes Lord but I wanted to read something just something about and I just dropped there about worry ISS come on I said the enemy from within your mind can become your own enemy y'all believe it come on it's it says by worriation these are some of the symptoms headaches stomach aches muscle aches nausea diarrhea irrit B syndrome whatever that means difficulty concentrating feeling rest restlessness having trouble relaxing feeling irritable you know turning it says in the unhealthy behaviors like overeating come on worriation got a lot of things it can mess you up on one of the things that this is one of the things that really really stuck out to me it says if it sticks around long enough something as small as a nagging concern in the back of your mind can have effect on your heart it can make you more likely to have high blood pressure a heart attack or even a stroke come on it says something as small as just a little nagging in the back of your mind if it stay around long enough look what it could do come on I said it's so the devil tonight come on but one thing about it what why do we have to worry when when God is we know God is in control of all things amen come on we know that God if you you got to know that though you see you got to know that God has ordered your footsteps amen you got to know who God if you don't know then these things will get hold to you but you got to know who God is amen and see that was the problem we won't have time tonight that was the problem with Israel I said the enemy from within Israel God had brought them through so many things didn't he amen so many battles the Lord had wed for him oh yes come on brought him out of bondage come on brought brought the plagues and all a man 80y old man with a stick in his hand all he had was thus sayith the Lord come on Amen but that word that he had from God that's where the power was come on the power wasn't in Moses the power wasn't even in the stick but the power was in God amen when God got hold to it come on Amen lot of the things what God had done for them God brought them through all those things I like how he says he I raised Pharaoh up for this purpose that I might show my power in Earth amen because before that time nobody had known the power of God like that but he wanted men to know how powerful he was amen come on so after when I get done now they'll know that I'm just more than just the one that spoke to Abraham come on called him out but I'm they'll know about my power when I get done with them amen oh Jesus and that's what God wants to do in our life he don't wants you just to be a normal just come in and out of church and don't experience the power just hear about it read about it but God wants you to know how powerful is amen oh Jesus amen that's why he allow things to come sometimes and he shows you glimpses of the power yes Lord but somewhere in the journey you forget about the power hallelujah amen oh sometimes you got to stir up your pay Mind by the way of remembrance and realize that he's the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he can do it again amen oh God do it again amen oh Jesus come on no matter how much the the the church might be going in into this formality come on or into this relaxed State amen God isn't relaxed he's still moving amen people are still seeing the power wake up let God move in your life my God is still living Hallelujah come on now that's what stirs us up because I know I'm serving a living God Amen come on but out of all the out of all the the uh things that God did for them right the Red Sea all the bread from Heaven the the the water in from the Rock and fighting all their enemies and all the things that God done that's the thing about it if you read a little further God was upset because he said they tried me they proved me and I did what I said I do I did what I promised I'd do they proved me but the biggest thing was yet they still don't believe me they still struggling with faith hallelujah amen oh Jesus out of all I done like somebody would have believed me come on same thing today right after all God has done come on just to save you from where you was at took a miracle I know for me it did Hallelujah changed me from who I was to what I am now that was a miracle amen come on that's why I always say God if you don't do nothing else you already done enough and I'm for real that's the truth hallelujah am oh God Lord but I said one thing about it after all God did for them is Israel was going to find out that their greatest enemy wasn't the amalekites wasn't the jebusites weren all those come on those weren't their greatest enemies the greatest enemy they was going to find out was they their own self amen come on Amen the Bible says they a't go in because of unbelief that was the enemy come on Amen the thing about it was even I was meditating on this for a while even after all that God done and God told them go out and spy the land Hallelujah and they went out and they spy it not only did they spy it but they brought back the fruits that was in the land amen come on Amen they brought back the grapes the pomeg oh Jesus amen they brought back the goods and the thing about it was you know when Moses he didn't just send anybody out but he got the leaders of the tribes come on didn't he he got the heads get the leaders let them go out spider land it's sad to say it but 10 out of the 12 leaders came back with a bad report amen come on Amen didn't they amen 10 out of the 12 say come back stirring up unbelief in the camp didn't they amen come on oh Jesus but I said the thing was you know they come back with the very fruits even testifying of it right come on testifying yes sir of the of of everything is just like what God said it is amen come on I want to ask you the question tonight do you think God God brought you this far to leave you come on let me ask you that you think God brought you this far to leave you sir come on God ain't a God Like That Hallelujah he's not a God that can't finish the job amen he's not one that only see you halfway through but God is one that can take you on Hallelujah but you got to let God take you home amen you got to let him finish the work that he started in your life but sometimes what happens I don't know about you but when when the Lord saved me you know you was in such a shape that you knew you couldn't get yourself out of that amen you was helpless hopeless and all of a sudden now this Mighty God come on the scene amen hallelujah and he do the things for you that nobody else couldn't do come on amen he was your friend in those loneliness when everybody else walked away come on God picked you up cleaned you off now nobody can't even recognize you sometimes right oh Jesus amen but sometimes after God clean you up you forget about God come on oh Jesus God got to remind us sometimes amen like he did Israel say your mom mother when she had you she left you out in the street covered in blood come on everybody walked by you looked at you and said die but when I saw you I said Live come on God got to remind us sometimes that you might be set up now but you still need me hallelujah amen you still need my grace you still need my Mercy oh Jesus God I need your mercy Lord I need your grace even right now oh Jesus come on God got to remind us yes but what it was I said they was going to find out that they was their worst enemy come on you know when they got to the land if they would only have faith come on as Joshua and Caleb but the Bible said they was of another Spirit if they had only had Faith then nothing would have been able to stand in front before before them nothing can you imagine that the only believe no enemy would have been able to stand before but like we said the enemy from within you know the scriptures kept saying that when they begin to talk about the land they said we saw come on we saw we saw Hallelujah at that point their eyes become their own enemy didn't it come on Amen your eyes can become your own enemy come on what we saw we saw this yes we know what God Said and we know that God is all powerful but come on our enem what we saw is big bigger than us it might be bigger than us but it ain't bigger than God Amen come on Amen oh Jesus I said things might be hard situations might be tough might be big yes it might be bigger than me but one thing about it Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world no matter how big it is it ain't bigger than God Amen come on Amen oh Jesus amen God is greater than all these things amen I don't know about you but that stirs me up I believe that come on I says the thing about it was Joshua and and Caleb they went and they saw the same things other spies saw didn't they come on they saw it but the only difference was like we said the other other day only difference was one of them come on they was looking at it not through their natural eyes but they was looking at it through the eyes of the promise that God had made him come on the promise that God had made him was stronger than any enemy that was in the land the promise that God had made them was more powerful than all all the Giants the wall cities and all that the promise that God had made them I don't know how but I know what God said to me amen oh Jesus I don't know when but I know what God said to me amen and he can't he's not a man that he should lie he ain't going to break his promise but he'll do just what he said I'mma wait on him amen come on I don't know about you but I said I'm going wait on them Hallelujah come on Amen but what it is like said the enemy from within they found out that all the others weren't the enemy they were their own enemies come on Amen their worst enemies wasn't they cuz after that God turned them away hallelujah amen and for 40 years God was grieved with that Generation all because they couldn't believe out of all the signs and wonders they saw out of all the Miracles out of all the mighty revivals they had come on they struggled with faith didn't they they struggled to just believe you know one thing I said all those other uh trials were just just to get them ready for the climax come on was wanting to build their faith and build their faith but here at the climax now they struggling with just simply believing God amen come on taking God at his word but yet they let worriation and other things get there come on oh Jesus you know one thing like the prophet of God was bringing out I like he was saying that they struggled one thing they could didn't know how to accept was God's grace come on but we find the same thing today it's hard for a man just to accept that it's God that's doing it Hallelujah come on but they always felt like feel like they got to have something to do with it amen come on they got to do something they got to have something to say well I did this or whatever come on but to realize that this whole journey their whole journey was by Grace God made the the father's a promise and he came and got them grace and mercy brought them to this point but they struggled with it Hallelujah come on they they couldn't accept God's grace and we find the same see it's unbelievable it's hard to believe that God done the work and you don't have to do nothing Hallelujah that's it it's hard to believe that the devil have you in your mind always thinking it's something you got to do whatever but the struggle you struggling with it instead of just opening your arms freely Hallelujah and say God I just received what you did for me I couldn't do nothing on my own anyway God it was all you and I'm just receiving what you done for me come on I'm just riding the grace of God hallelujah I'm just riding the mercy of God realizing there's nothing I could do but it was all him Hallelujah come on but when you all in the way come on then you
