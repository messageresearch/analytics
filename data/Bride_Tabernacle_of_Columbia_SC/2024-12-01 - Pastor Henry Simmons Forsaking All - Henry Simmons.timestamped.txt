[35:00] Paul says if in this life we only have
[35:02] hope we're all men most
[35:05] miserable there must be
[35:07] something more than this amen because
[35:11] it's it's it's fading is just we're just
[35:15] here for a
[35:16] moment but while we're here we're making
[35:19] preparation for
[35:20] eternity so by the grace of God as we
[35:23] make our preparation for
[35:25] eternity somewhere we're on when we
[35:28] leave here this body this time that
[35:31] we're here let us only do those things
[35:35] that would
[35:36] be the
[35:40] Everlasting
[35:42] Mark 10 and
[35:50] 17 and when he was gone forth unto the
[35:55] way there came one running and kneeling
[36:00] to him and ask him good Master what
[36:05] shall I do that I may inherit eternal
[36:08] life and Jesus said unto him why callest
[36:12] thou me good there's none good but one
[36:17] that is God thou knowest the
[36:20] Commandments do not commit adultery do
[36:23] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[36:27] Witnesses defraud not honor thy father
[36:30] and thy mother he answered and said unto
[36:34] him master all these have I observed
[36:39] from my
[36:40] youth then Jesus beholding him loved him
[36:45] and said unto him one thing thou liketh
[36:50] go thy way and sell whatsoever thou has
[36:54] and give to the poor and thou shall have
[36:58] Treasures in Heaven and come take up the
[37:03] cross and follow me and he was sad at
[37:07] that saying and went away grieve for he
[37:11] had great
[37:13] possession God bless read the word you
[37:15] may be
[37:17] seated and I'll just continue on at the
[37:20] 23rd verse and Jesus looked
[37:23] around and
[37:25] said unto his discip
[37:28] deciples how hardly shall they that have
[37:33] riches enter into the kingdom of God and
[37:38] the disciples were astonished at his
[37:41] word but Jesus answered again and said
[37:45] unto them children how hard is it for
[37:50] them that trust in riches to enter into
[37:54] the kingdom of God it is easier for a
[37:58] camel to go through the eye of a needle
[38:02] than for a rich man to enter into the
[38:05] kingdom of
[38:07] God and they were astonished out of
[38:11] measure saying among themselves who then
[38:16] can be saved and Jesus looked upon them
[38:20] and said with men it is
[38:23] impossible but not with God for With God
[38:28] all things are
[38:30] possible then
[38:32] Peter began to say unto him Lo we have
[38:37] left all and have followed thee and
[38:41] Jesus answered and said verely I say
[38:44] unto you there is no man that has left
[38:48] houses or Brethren or sister or father
[38:52] mother a wife or children a land for my
[38:56] sake
[38:58] and the
[38:59] gospel but he shall receive aund fold
[39:04] now in this time houses and Brethren and
[39:10] sisters and mother and children and land
[39:15] with
[39:16] persecution and in the world to come
[39:21] eternal life and many that were first
[39:25] shall be last and the last shall be
[39:28] first God bless you reading this word
[39:31] you by the grace of God I chose the
[39:34] topic this morning and I was D in prayer
[39:37] and I on yesterday and it came in my
[39:42] heart forsaken
[39:45] all forsaken
[39:49] all and now many times
[39:52] we we come to places in our life I know
[39:57] was a young man I came to that Crossroad
[40:00] in my life well I looked at life and I
[40:03] didn't see
[40:04] much in the future and on the
[40:08] horizon I didn't see
[40:10] purpose didn't know what I wanted to do
[40:13] didn't know where I wanted to go I
[40:16] really I wanted to be going the military
[40:20] and my hopes was dashed when they said
[40:23] your knee operation wouldn't allow you I
[40:27] said
[40:27] okay what I do with my life what do I do
[40:31] with my
[40:32] life from a child I thought I wanted to
[40:35] serve the Lord but I wanted to
[40:38] experience life
[40:40] first I wanted to first of all let me do
[40:45] all the wrong that I can do inoc sense
[40:48] all the little things that I imagine to
[40:51] do let me get rich and let me do this
[40:54] that and at the end of the road maybe I
[40:58] give I want to serve the Lord I want I
[41:01] really want to go to heaven I want to
[41:02] really want to serve the Lord and I want
[41:04] to go to heaven at the end but let me
[41:07] first of all get all the stuff out the
[41:10] way that I want to
[41:12] do and uh I I imagine that most people
[41:16] figure you know my life is in my hand
[41:20] and I can do what I choose to
[41:24] do so my eternity
[41:27] I can't play I Can't Go to military let
[41:30] me go back
[41:32] to the
[41:35] football so I said okay give that
[41:37] another chance so we wanted to do
[41:41] something with your life you want to
[41:43] think you still can make
[41:46] it so I thought I'll try going by at the
[41:51] same time I come to
[41:53] church and I get baptized and want to
[41:57] serve the
[41:58] Lord still have
[42:02] aspirations when did I give did I
[42:04] forsake
[42:06] all then that question comes down in my
[42:08] heart and you know uh it didn't take
[42:12] much in church to make me kind
[42:15] of you know cuz it's too much hypocrisy
[42:19] too many Hypocrites in the church you
[42:20] know I see so much wrong in the church I
[42:23] see so many people that's
[42:25] faking I can't I can't can't stand that
[42:28] so I just uh people are not
[42:32] real so I found fault in the church
[42:36] because I find fault in the people so I
[42:39] just said well let me just try to y'all
[42:43] would say today chill out let me just
[42:46] going about my
[42:48] business so but what what what what what
[42:51] was my
[42:53] alterity drinking smoking
[42:59] where where I where's my pleasure
[43:02] where's what am I going to enjoy in life
[43:04] what am I going to do with
[43:08] life I can't
[43:11] drink I see what happened to people that
[43:14] drink okay drugs uh-uh I don't want
[43:19] nothing to have power over me smoking no
[43:22] I ain't doing that okay so what do you
[43:24] got you got a world that says
[43:28] smoke get a joint smoke get
[43:31] high snot some coke shoot some Heron
[43:35] what you going to do that for pleasure
[43:38] what are you going to do for
[43:39] Joy you got a choice to
[43:42] me go to church lot of
[43:46] Hypocrites go to Street what am I offer
[43:50] because I got to have some f got to have
[43:52] something to do with my life what am I
[43:54] going to do with it
[44:00] so something had to
[44:02] change something had to
[44:05] change see I didn't try to go to God but
[44:10] I
[44:12] think God came to me
[44:16] amen because just going to church wasn't
[44:20] working so God had to come to
[44:24] me and when he came to me
[44:29] my eyes was
[44:30] open is this what you
[44:33] want is this what you
[44:35] want he actually showed
[44:37] me what I what I was going after he said
[44:42] this is what you
[44:43] want and I
[44:46] says cuz at the end of this this is what
[44:50] you're going to
[44:51] get your soul is going to be lost is
[44:54] that what you want
[44:58] and I
[45:00] says says now who's this that's coming
[45:05] to me and is talking to
[45:08] me because it sound
[45:11] like I'm being confronted with my
[45:15] life I'm being confronted with my life
[45:17] and what I'm going to do with it now am
[45:21] I going to go down that road knowing
[45:25] that I'm going be lost
[45:27] knowing
[45:29] that things are going to
[45:32] happen and it's not going to be good I
[45:35] said
[45:36] okay my only alternative
[45:39] is I believe that this is God that's
[45:42] dealing with my life this is God that's
[45:44] speaking to me this is God that's
[45:46] showing
[45:47] me you don't want to go that
[45:50] way you don't want to go that
[45:53] way I said okay
[45:57] I believe that this is God telling me
[45:59] don't go down that
[46:00] road don't you do
[46:03] it
[46:05] though I was kind of
[46:08] well now it becomes me and God it's no
[46:13] more the the church and the people in
[46:15] the church it's me and God
[46:19] now
[46:20] so now I've come to
[46:23] church I I I don't come to look at what
[46:27] people are doing I come because I want a
[46:29] relationship with
[46:31] him so it doesn't matter what other
[46:34] people doing Hypocrites and false
[46:37] preachers and all of that that don't
[46:39] matter I want a relationship with
[46:42] God so I come and took my Bible from
[46:46] genes started Genesis not understanding
[46:49] even how to read like that because when
[46:52] I went to church yeah we probably look
[46:55] at the Bible this that but just going to
[46:58] church not really getting into the word
[47:00] now I'm really getting down to business
[47:03] getting in the word praying I'm fasting
[47:05] I'm seeking God I'm in the word
[47:09] now here we
[47:11] are now it comes down
[47:15] to the reality forsaken
[47:18] all forsaken
[47:21] all I want the Holy Ghost now I'm
[47:23] praying God fill me with the Holy Ghost
[47:29] and I I'm ready to give it up all now I
[47:31] want the Holy Ghost I just you know I
[47:35] just don't want to come to church I want
[47:36] the Holy Ghost because
[47:39] Lord I'm caught up in in the world and
[47:44] doing things that I you know I didn't
[47:47] want to do and sometimes you cut
[47:49] yourself in a place to do something you
[47:51] thought you never
[47:54] do but you caught up in that place yes
[47:58] amen and
[47:59] somehow getting caught up in the place
[48:01] and doing stuff you thought you'll never
[48:03] do and God
[48:05] said you get me out of that how did I
[48:09] get in that place I almost did something
[48:12] so I said I never
[48:14] do but I got that close and I got
[48:19] out and I said thank you I said oh and
[48:23] then I look back at it I said God must
[48:25] have oh oh God you must was with
[48:28] me and so a lot of times we get in
[48:31] places because we fail to come God's
[48:35] provided
[48:36] way God has provided a way for our lives
[48:40] but sometimes we don't want to go to
[48:42] God's provided way sometimes we trying
[48:44] to
[48:44] just just trying to live and go through
[48:48] life but God has a plan and provided
[48:52] way this young man he came to Jesus
[48:57] because he saw something in Jesus I'm
[49:00] talking about he saw something in God he
[49:03] saw something in
[49:05] Jesus that was different amen
[49:09] amen I trust that you see something in
[49:12] Jesus that's
[49:14] different that's different from
[49:16] everything else that you might view
[49:18] everything else you might see I trust
[49:19] that you see something in
[49:22] Jesus that's different
[49:27] and he this young man saw something
[49:30] different and he realized he said good
[49:33] Master you got
[49:36] something what must I do that I might
[49:39] have eternal
[49:41] life I wonder if it ever dawned on you
[49:46] that it's more the life
[49:48] than see when you get past 35 the second
[49:52] time you realize how short life is
[49:58] it's it it travels so
[50:00] fast and life is so
[50:03] short but what am I living
[50:08] for and what am I doing with this life
[50:11] why am I here and what purpose am I here
[50:16] for what am I here what am I doing in
[50:20] here with this life what am I what am I
[50:23] to do with
[50:25] it because I'm here didn't ask to be
[50:29] here but I am
[50:32] here what am I doing with it is it value
[50:36] is it any value to
[50:38] it and is it is it any value to how I'm
[50:42] conducting my life is it any value what
[50:45] is the outcome of of what I'm doing what
[50:49] what is My outcome what am I looking
[50:52] forward to what is my future in it
[50:58] I look at it and I
[51:01] say the same old same
[51:04] old a little bit more of this and a
[51:06] little bit more of that but it's the
[51:08] same old same old uhuh I it must be
[51:12] something
[51:14] more it must be something more to
[51:19] life than what I'm experiencing it must
[51:22] be something
[51:23] more okay finish school get a
[51:27] job work get a house get a car must be
[51:32] something more than
[51:33] that that's
[51:36] all get a
[51:39] hamburger eat a
[51:41] steak it must be something
[51:44] more is that's all people just happy but
[51:48] me I got to take it more
[51:50] serious it's more serious than that to
[51:54] me because I I can't
[51:57] I can't accept that this is
[51:59] it I can't I just can't deal with this
[52:03] this all it
[52:05] is I can't deal with that this it got to
[52:08] be something
[52:10] more than
[52:16] this so by the grace of God the Young
[52:19] Rich ruler realized it was more it was
[52:23] something he called eternal life
[52:28] and he said I want
[52:30] it shake somebody hand and said do you
[52:33] want eternal
[52:39] life that young man he was
[52:42] rich he went to
[52:45] church he went to church because he said
[52:49] all these I have kept from my youth up
[52:51] he knew God from a a letter standpoint
[52:55] and for religious standpoint he perhaps
[52:59] was a better what y'all would say today
[53:01] a better Christian than most of
[53:06] us you know what I'm saying the man said
[53:08] I never from my youth up all the stuff
[53:12] the other folks did I ain't never
[53:15] done cuz I kept them from my youth
[53:18] up you see what I'm saying so a lot of
[53:20] stuff that we done he ain't never
[53:24] done but yet
[53:29] a lot of stuff you want to do he ain't
[53:31] never
[53:34] done but he wanted eternal life see cuz
[53:38] some of us think you know if I go to to
[53:41] the Lord if I if I go to and give God my
[53:45] heart I ain't going to be able to do
[53:49] this and that and the other this man
[53:51] ain't never done
[53:53] it but yet he saw something he saw need
[53:57] he saw thirst he saw something that he
[53:59] needed that was more
[54:02] than just the money that he
[54:05] had just all that his accumulation nice
[54:09] businessman nice man attitud had
[54:13] everything look like everything that you
[54:16] probably want he had
[54:18] it everything you trying to get he had
[54:21] it then cuz he was rich already he was
[54:25] young and Rich
[54:27] and then he was not just young and Rich
[54:29] but he was a
[54:30] ruler so he had you know he he had
[54:34] position he had status quoe he had
[54:38] everything
[54:40] but he didn't have eternal life that's
[54:43] the thing that he wanted that he didn't
[54:46] have eternal life went to church but he
[54:49] didn't have eternal
[54:53] life look at my life I wanted the Holy
[54:55] Ghost
[54:58] but before I could get the Holy Ghost I
[55:01] had to come to the
[55:03] point I had to give up
[55:06] everything I had to forsake
[55:10] all you know why I wanted the Holy Ghost
[55:13] cuz I
[55:14] knew I needed
[55:17] it I wanted it because I knew I needed
[55:22] it I I I noticed that most people that
[55:26] they go through the motion they come in
[55:27] to be a part of a church and they never
[55:30] that's far as they go young man had all
[55:32] of
[55:33] that but he wanted eternal life in other
[55:37] words he wanted the Holy Ghost he wanted
[55:38] an experience with
[55:42] God it's not enough just to be baptized
[55:45] and just to be in church but I want I
[55:48] want eternal
[55:50] life to get eternal life you know I I
[55:54] can believe on Jesus and accept him as
[55:57] Savior and as Lord but I want to it
[55:59] comes down to the point I want the Holy
[56:00] Ghost I want eternal life I got to what
[56:04] forsake what forsake
[56:07] what Shake somebody hand and tell them
[56:11] forsake
[56:14] all forsake
[56:17] all now you heard you you I read off
[56:20] some of the things that you got to give

[1:00:07] that he was much
[1:00:09] more he had his life was far beyond what
[1:00:14] we talking about you
[1:00:17] know but Jesus found the thing that was
[1:00:21] dear to his heart where his treasure
[1:00:24] was and he told him
[1:00:27] I want you to have Treasures in Heaven
[1:00:30] but before you have Treasures in Heaven
[1:00:31] I want you to what forsake
[1:00:35] what I want

[1:01:16] life didn't you say you want eternal
[1:01:21] life you go

[1:01:27] go sell all that you
[1:01:30] have and give it to
[1:01:32] who give it to who po y'all y'all heard
[1:01:37] give it to who the poor the

[1:01:47] you want me to give it to
[1:01:49] them give it to
[1:01:51] who who you talking to
[1:01:57] you talking to me see some things God
[1:02:00] talks to you you and in your spirit in
[1:02:03] your inner self in your spirit man God
[1:02:06] talks to you and because he knows what
[1:02:09] it's going to take for you Amen to get
[1:02:13] eternal life so he speaks to you amen
[1:02:17] where
[1:02:18] amen where your treasure is what the
[1:02:21] thing that you're holding on to that you
[1:02:23] don't want to give up he speaks to you
[1:02:25] in that
[1:02:26] area he not going to tell you that ain't
[1:02:29] got no money ain't got nothing to give
[1:02:31] it up
[1:02:33] all sell all you got and you ain't got
[1:02:36] nothing to sell you know what I'm saying
[1:02:38] but he's speaking to where it's going to
[1:02:41] hurt are you with
[1:02:43] me now now God would speak to you if if
[1:02:47] if you truly come to God he's going to
[1:02:50] speak to you where it's going to hurt
[1:02:52] you where it's going to cost you
[1:02:54] something
[1:02:56] are you with me and see sometimes we
[1:02:59] want eternal life but we don't want to
[1:03:01] give up
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:05] nothing to to have eternal life you must
[1:03:09] be willing to give it
[1:03:11] up but what are you willing to give up
[1:03:13] for
[1:03:15] it I don't want to I ain't got okay you
[1:03:19] got something if it's if it's just your
[1:03:23] pride your pride
[1:03:27] see some folk ain't got no money ain't
[1:03:28] got a penny but they got a whole lot of
[1:03:30] pride pride about Pride about
[1:03:34] themselves I got to get Rachel to help
[1:03:36] me pronounce that
[1:03:41] word proud a proud
[1:03:44] Spirit a proud Spirit ain't got no money
[1:03:47] in the
[1:03:50] bank you got nothing to boast or brag
[1:03:52] about but you still got Pride that
[1:03:54] you're dealing with
[1:03:57] and God will ask you to give it up sell
[1:03:59] all that you
[1:04:01] have sell all forsake it
[1:04:06] all I want
[1:04:08] to maybe I spent too much time on
[1:04:11] forsaking it all
[1:04:13] but let me tell you
[1:04:16] something each one of us come to that
[1:04:19] place that
[1:04:20] cross and each one of us has to
[1:04:23] crucify themselves you have to be
[1:04:26] crucified you have to die to self will
[1:04:30] and self want and what self needs we
[1:04:34] have to die to that we have to come to
[1:04:37] the Cross we got to be willing to
[1:04:41] forsake all to follow Jesus I think
[1:04:45] that's the problem with the
[1:04:48] church there's no sacrificial Lambs
[1:04:53] there's no people that
[1:04:56] really want to make
[1:05:00] sacrifices we don't find even it don't
[1:05:04] take much for us not to come to
[1:05:09] church and the little that we give
[1:05:12] God it's not a really a
[1:05:16] sacrifice because we don't give to the
[1:05:19] point that it's a sacrifice our life

[1:05:50] to say I I go to church to say I'm saved
[1:05:54] and say I love the Lord Lord we do just
[1:05:57] enough to satisfy
[1:06:01] ourselves but is it enough for
[1:06:04] God have we forsaken

[1:06:43] able to lead him to a better
[1:06:46] country than the country that he was
[1:06:48] living in the Bible said Abraham looked
[1:06:51] for a city whose Builder and maker was
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:56] so Abraham sojourned out of his homeland
