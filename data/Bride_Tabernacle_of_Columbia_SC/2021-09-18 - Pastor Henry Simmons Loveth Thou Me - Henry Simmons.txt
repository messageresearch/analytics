thank the lord god it's good amen trouble in my way i have to cry sometimes so much trouble amen there's a lot of trouble going on in there right but i know jesus he'll fix it jesus has already fixed it amen god bless you saint john 21 15. and it reads so when they had dying jesus said unto simon peter he said unto simon say to peter simon peter simon son of jonah loveth thou me more than these and he said unto him yea lord thy noise that i love thee he said unto him feed my lamb i'll let you to read the 16th church he said unto him the third time simon son of jonah loveth thou me peter was grieved because he had said unto him the third time loveth thou me and he said unto him lord thou knoweth all things thou knoweth that i love thee jesus said unto him feed my sheep 18. thus speak he signified by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he said unto him follow me god bless you reading this word you may be seated i was just meditating upon the word and as i was meditating upon the word is these scriptures began to go through through my mind and i just looked like the lord just given me a message and it's from different angles and i like to just to share with you some of the angles in which you know i i thought about you know the capstone and the headstone come into the body but he says love without me more than these love without me more than these so we think that jesus knows all things but he said love is thou me and then jesus did not call him peter but he called him simon what came in my spirit was jesus didn't ask him one time do you love me but it was three times that he had to say do you love me just what if jesus questioned you concerning your love towards him and you might reply to jesus lord you know i love you but peter action a few this is after jesus had rose from the dead and they was going back if you read the uh uh the upper part of this chapter they jesus was resurrected and yet appeared to them and and they were out fishing and they hadn't caught nothing and jesus uh said i want you to cast your net on the right side of the ship and you know sometimes when jesus tells you to do something you just do it and uh so when they did because though they had tall all night and everything they were knowing how to fish but all of a sudden they did what he said and the net was full of fishes so when they brought the fish in and so forth jesus told them to come and die amen and as they you know probably fellowship sitting around jesus didn't point to um the different ones that were there the bible tells us that you know it wasn't just peter peter told him let's go fishing and the rest several of them said okay we'll go too we'll go with you what happened when jesus met simon peter those they were fishing and jesus said drop your nets and come in what follow me so here it was an occasion that peter had denied the lord three times he denied the lord three times and i i i'm thinking that we're talking about manifested sons of god and the expectation of things that ought to be and who we ought to be in this the hour that we're living in as sons and daughters of god but yet there are certain challenges that we have the question love it thou me here's peter the man with the keys jesus didn't call him simon he said bless of the loud simon with johnner flesh and book then he's going to call him peter okay so he hasn't he has a name change but because of his action his name was going back to who he was son of jonah simon son of john so jesus knew i'm not calling you peter i'm calling you i'm not calling you cephalus amen i'm not calling you i'm i'm i'm calling you simon i'm not calling you peter okay so by the grace of god things happen in our lives un beware and jesus had told him you're going to deny me three times before the clock crow but peter cursed i mean peter denied he said lord all forsake you i won't we can be so determined in our faith that lord i don't care who stopped i don't care who stopped following you i don't care who don't believe you lord i'm going all the way so we can have that independent confession and he told peter flesh and blood is not to reveal this unto thee but my father which is in heaven upon this rock i'll be in my church are you with me so so by the grace of god and i give you the keys he entrusts him with the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you're bound on earth you're blind in heaven whatever you're loosing her elusive you got the keys man the man with the keys curse swear i don't shouldn't this love be questioned see sometimes your love has to be questioned do you really love it do you really love the lord it comes to those times when you say yay lord i you know i love you but your action peter had fallen from grace he had done something that was with the keys can i trust this person but jesus knows all things don't he but yet he was gonna let it sink in with peter and sometimes i think things ought to sink in with us love without me more than these now we know that let's just read a little bit of the first part and after these things jesus showed himself against his disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise showed he himself and there was gathered together simon peter thomas called didymus nathaniel of canaan in galilee and the sons of zebedees and two other disciples you see and simon peter said in third verse unto him them i go fishing i'm going fishing you know the bible tells us that jesus appeared to them while it was fellowshipping he came through the door and and tom thomas died and said who and thomas said my lord and my god but do you think after so many times god showing his resurrection that he's risen and all of that and then all of a sudden we're still going fishing know i'm going fishing you know sometimes we forget what god called us our position and what god called us to do but he says i go fishing and look at the rest of them hey we're going to we're going to go too so you know if you falling from grace nine out of ten feel when a person backslide or fall from grace you find themselves going back to do what they used to do are you maybe that that was their trade that's the way they made money you know i'm saying let's go back to work some of the brothers told me when the prophet died a lot of people were looking for the coming of the lord and when the lord did not come some went to their several professions and everything and and then you know people began to even though the lord was blessed financially a lot of people were living you know maybe an apartment no matter who's bringing in thousands of dollars all they want to do is get the gospel then it came to a point where everybody got a little relaxed folks was getting rich folks it's going back to work and all kinds of stuff and after a period of time i believe that that fire that anticipation on the coming of the lord everything kind of you know dwindle and i remember how fired up this area was uh with the lord the coming of the lord it lord might come any time all of a sudden you know now look what had happened they crucified the lord but god had come back and appeared to them and then he told them to meet him and got a lead and so forth and but a lot of times in the midst of the coming of the lord and god doing things in our lives and meeting us and showing us his resurrection power is not enough for us to see that he's arisen see because we could see hey this jesus he's a rhythm but something we must experience the resurrection as individuals we got to have that experience ourselves are you with me so god wants to go a little farther a little bit more in depth with you and get your attention do you really really love me do you really love me more than these now it could have been that he was saying more than these more than these fellows that you're hanging out with fishing with your brother one of the fishermen do you love me more than these maybe it could have been that he said these he was talking about you got this boat and you're going back to your trade more than your job your lover down me more than these you know just what was he you know you know it's speaking to you tonight and god putting this on my heart love without me more than these more than you know we talking my capstone headstone you know when i was thinking about god is that great fountain of love amen and out of love comes forth his attributes and his character amen and his character is expressed because perfect love is in you then it can bring forth the divine nature of god because that divine nature comes from the fountain are you with me let me try to get it all in i don't know how to do it but just pray for me amen he didn't say do you fear me are you with me some people are coming to church only because of the fear of god they don't want to go to hell he didn't say do you fear me are you are you afraid to go to hell he didn't expected that he said simon son of jonah do you love me you know i i've seen a lot of marriages a lot of people got married but they don't love one another and consequently it don't work out they marry for different reasons a lot of times the marriage just don't work out if you don't love the person and i've seen that that when a little bit of trials somebody loses jobs somebody helped fail or whatever the love is gone you see what i'm saying you said is that real genuine it's supposed to be genuine christians to do that too we know the world would do that but our love would be tested and showing off peter love i mean the man walking around with the keys to the kingdom i got the keys to the kingdom and yet he denied him you know if you would have been one of those disciples that saw uh feed five thousand saw ladders raised from the dead saw all these miracles and you know the people in the prophet days they saw all these things and all the miracles all the wheelchairs and all the all these things if you was one of those ones that seen all of that would you curse and swear that you don't even know the man you know some of us you know have experienced certain things in our lives and certain things that we've experienced jesus has done certain things for us as individuals but the question tonight loveth out me more than these more than these and he said um i won't read all of that i just go somewhere else loving him because you're free i mean serving him because you fear him you know sometimes he didn't say do you fear me do you trust me do you honor me do you admire me but he says do you love me you know it's not how much we wept and we've cried because a lot of people you did you know they weep and they cry and and and they say i love you and all i mean they weep they cry oh lord but do you love me what are you willing to forsake what are you willing to give up god's servant said forsaken all to follow him are you willing do you love him enough to forsake everything that's a question brother sister friend do you love him enough to forsake oh you know i see why god asks us to come together because it's just a this is a test because how how else is god going to examine our of love for him there's certain things that god does and we hear the word and and the word comes to find us out to help us along our journey the word comes to the tests our faith out it comes to examine us and see whether we be in the faith they come to prove us it comes to tests and trials amen and the word of the lord tried them okay so he says jesus one time said except for man forsake his father's mother even his own self you see what i'm saying sometimes you love you love yourself more than you love god love without me more than these peter he was scared god that was going to kill him so he was worrying about what himself see what i'm saying what if you were there warming by the fire and the dancer came to you well you're with the man you said oh no how deep is your love how rich is your love how how would your love stand up like peter you saw what happened to peter now if your love was tested and tried would it stand the test or would you just you know sometimes we don't even have to say that we know sometimes we fail are you with me we know sometimes we are not where we ought to be you know we supposed to be further up the road than we are we know in our lives that we can do better yes sir god has entrusted peter he's given peter a charge and he's given us a charge as the bride of jesus christ as manifested sons of god in this hour god has endured he's given us power he's trusted and given us authority he said i'm a trusting you and i'm giving you praise god the keys to the kingdom amen i'm entrusting you that you might be a distributor of eternal life that men would believe on me through their word through your word that you can impart eternal life a vessel that god can use to impart to speak the words of life use you as individuals yet you don't see your position you don't see the reality of who you are in your mission let's go fishing [Music] yes that sounds good man let's go fishing i better not say the other word y'all got me i didn't say that i heard it now i won't dare say it but let's go okay see where we are what what love it love me more than these just think about it love it on me more than these what is it what is god saying to me what do i need to forsake now i said he even come down to denying one own self you know it was a test of peter those that do not truly love christ would never truly love souls of men are you with me how can you love say you love god and hate your brother are you with me you cannot love god and hate your brother you can see in peter's ministry and the charge that god has given to him to feed my lamb to feed my sheep but how can you feed them if you don't love me i cannot entrust you with these keys now i might have to take these keys back but i'm questioning you and i want you to think i want you to think deep can i trust you peter will you do it again you know peter must have you know when he's acting the second time by the time he asked him the third time peter probably thought i believe he was grieved i believe he was grieved let me let me do something i'mma skip skip way over in this message and i'm gonna go to second corinthians seven see sometimes god has to go a little deeper because sometimes we don't understand what god is really asking us but he has to show us and and i can see peter mine reflecting back now he asked me three times and i denied him three times so he gets to conviction it gets down inside of him where he's dealing with what he had just done see god wants you to deal with what you're doing deal with it now and i want you to absolve just think how it must have made jesus feel to see peter do what he did but now he's working with peter come on i saw what you did but i'm trying to get you back to where you need to be because i got something i want you to have praise god you're getting him ready for the holy ghost so you're with me see god got to get you ready for the holy ghost so you got to get your right praise god because you can't go up in the upper room amen with all this fishing on your mind are you with me praise god you got to get rid of that fish you got to come to the calling that i call you for praise god the the will of god for my life i got to let you be first lord do i love you more than these do i trust you do i love him so in second corinthians seven and eight he says for though i make you sorry with a letter and do not i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry though it were but for a season see sometimes the word hits you pretty hard it'll make you sorry are you with me it's meant to be that way that's what paul said i do not repent are you with me somebody said well uh you need to now he wants you to jesus didn't have to i'm not stopping here peter do you love me and god ain't not gonna give up on you so easy amen you know a lot of things the corinthian church was putting up with paul told them he hounded one had his father's wife and he said put him out from among you you know paul could have put him out but paul lingard put him out he told them to put him out are you with me so oftentimes people want paul to do it paul paul was going to come to get on them because he told them to do it but they had to have enough grace to have enough nerve to put that person out that did that oh you hooked me and sometimes it comes down to the church taking amen on their ambassadorship and standing up for christ and doing the things that's going to help one another and don't let all the responsibility come on the ministry but let's be helpless one of another even though it might hurt let's help one another it says now i rejoice not that you may that you were made sorry but that ye what see sometimes people say well i did something forgive me i got to forgive you because the lord said forgive them you got to forgive me you know some people they just pick at you and pick at you and and then they say you got to forgive me i just say i'm a preacher you should do me like that look at me he said you got to you know and you have those that do those things but you know that's not wise to do anybody like that that's not christian like to do anybody just pick on people but nevertheless we want genuinely repentance sorry not see peter had to come where he was greed the bible said he was grieved and said lord you know my heart and you know that i love you lord so you got to come to conviction not is you and the lord you and the lord before you can actually love your brother or one another you got to come to grips with your love for god and you got to let that ankle with inside of you lord you know i love you and it's got to come down deep and it got to come from the heart where you know somebody can you know go and sin and do something and they might yeah i did it for what you gonna do about it you know what the church gonna do about it i don't care if the church don't like it yeah i did it and the church looking we got to forgive yeah no you don't have the bible paul says now i rejoice not that you were made sorry but that ye sorrow to what i want you to be sorry enough to repent until repentance until it turned your whole life around are you with me true repentance true confession that you're sorry unto repentance say some people sorry i've done it but sorry until repentance that you repent of the things that you've done too many times okay i'm saying simon do you love me more than these are you truly in love with god or you love the things of this world more are you loving whatever that thing is more these more of this more of that more love it thou me more than these then i i want you to come to true recognition that i am putting something in front of god and i love this more than i love god and when i can come to reality you know peter it was dealing with his life i i i don't know the man i i don't know him i'm talking about dealing with your soul do you love god in such a way amen that you're willing to die whatever it takes lord i love you i love you more than these i believe i believe he had to be re-examined because somewhere along the line something has shook his faith i believe we need to re-examine our faith i believe we need to check our faith out again are we really contending for the faith that was once delivered unto the sake i have our faith is shaken peter was not ready to do the task that god had given him the keys that he had given him he was not ready and it was showing that he wasn't ready but jesus told peter at the time he said i pray for you that your faith fail you're not and he knew that peter needed convert to be converted are you a man and god knows that as some of us tonight need come to be converted he said when you were converted he said strengthen your brother in when you converted now amen i don't care how many devils peter those might have cast out how many people got healed how many evaluates me they went to how much they had preached and the devils were subject to and they were rejoicing it's the rejoice not because the devils are subject but rather your names are written in heaven so i don't care how many times you you know it comes down do you love me more than these because you know we can't go by past 10th what we did yesterday it's the day where are you now what's in the way do you love me more than these right now where are you like he said to adam well down and i'm saying well i'm naked you know what i'm saying we got to come and recognize our spiritual condition and we got to be come to grips with it loving me more than these but ye sorrow unto repentance sometimes we have to look at ourselves and see whether or not we can get god let me let me go he said sorry children for ye were for ye were made sorry after a godly manner see it's got to be a godly manner not just i'm sorry i'm sorry but after a godly manner that you might receive damage by us in nothing for what tempers for what see not just sorry but we want what godless sorry you know what i'm saying let it be godly ah yeah i repent i yeah i did something so almost like you're bragging all y'all can do is forgive me ah you can't do nothing but again man some folks we bring them before the church time and time time and time and they just keep on coming i committed adultery lessons today i committed the doctor this day i did this i did that and they just keep coming for the church but it is a godly sorrow the sorry that godly sorrow unto what godly sorrow working repentance to what i'm talking about when you truly deliberate not oh i got well i'm going through the order you know i'm going through the letter of what we're supposed to do but god ain't in it the letter yes we carried everything out straight as the letter said but there was no deliverance deliverance only comes when it's godless sorrow unto repentance then there's a change in your action a change in your life well you wonder why sometimes it looks like people doing everything just to the level just like the word say just like the prophet said still amen all kind of filth and dirt being known they can't seem to be deliberate because god ain't in it praise god it's got to be godly sorry until repentance whereas lives are really transformed and change but before peter could be entrusted with the keys and god can restore peter peter had amen he had to come to grips amen of his condition and brother and sister until you can come and see your condition you'll never repent of anything because you don't have anything to be repented of because god has not shown you your yourself and the spiritual condition that you're in until god revealed to you the help that you need and the conviction that you need the conviction you need true conviction you need to really be sorry and grieve to lord i i'm sorry god i'm sorry to keep on doing the same thing over and over god i come to a point amen lord i'm really love you lord and i don't want to do it no more some men they go against their wives some wives go against their husbands sometimes they just keep doing it over and over and over again come back baby i love you baby i love you but forgive me go and do it again baby i love you do it again do you really love her do you really love him you see some folks amen the bible says that's worldly they love the world people that love the world they love the world more love without me more than these you do you love god more than you love the world and the things of the world brothers and sisters that's what it's got to come down to peter loved fishing come on he loved himself he had forgotten his calling brother and sister we are manifested sons of god headed to heaven glory land amen we ought not let nothing shake our faith in god amen we
