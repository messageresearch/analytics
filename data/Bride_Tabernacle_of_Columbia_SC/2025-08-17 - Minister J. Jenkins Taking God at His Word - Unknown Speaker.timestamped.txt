[41:58] &gt;&gt; The book of um St. Luke. Amen. St. Luke
[42:01] chapter 5.
[42:03] My topic tonight this morning, man, is
[42:04] taking God at his word. Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Taking God at his word. Amen.
[42:10] How many God the word will not fail you?
[42:12] Amen.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; We see everything else is failing. We
[42:15] see the politics failing. Amen. The
[42:16] government failing, the the the the
[42:18] money system failing. Everything is
[42:20] failing. Only thing that won't fail is
[42:21] the word of God. Amen. So take God at
[42:23] his word. Amen. St. Luke chapter 5,
[42:26] start at verse one. It said, "It came to
[42:28] pass that as a people pressed upon him
[42:30] to hear the word of God, he stood by the
[42:32] lake of Gethinet and saw two ships
[42:34] standing by the lake, but the fishermen
[42:36] were going out of them and were washing
[42:38] their nets. And he entered into one of
[42:40] the ships which was Simon. I want you to
[42:41] realize this. Jesus Christ had not
[42:44] called Simon yet. Simon had just not met
[42:46] Simon." If you go book of four, read
[42:48] where Jesus Christ has healed Simon
[42:50] Peter's mother. Amen. So he did. They
[42:52] don't have they don't really have a
[42:53] relationship. Amen. But thank God if
[42:55] you're a child of God, God's obligated
[42:56] to come to you. Amen. Amen. So I just
[42:58] want you to get it right. So he's this
[43:00] is this is the this is the really the
[43:01] calling of Simon Pet. Amen. So say and
[43:03] to one of the and the ships was the
[43:05] Simons and prayed him that he would
[43:07] thrust out a little from the land and he
[43:09] sat down and taught the people out of
[43:11] the ship. And now he had left speaking.
[43:12] He said to Simon, "Simon, launch out
[43:15] into the deep and let down your nets for
[43:16] a draw." And Simon answered said to him,
[43:18] "Master, we have told all night. We have
[43:21] taken nothing. Nevertheless, at thy
[43:23] word, I will let down the net. And when
[43:25] they had did this, when they had when he
[43:28] had this done, they enclosed a great
[43:30] multitude of fishes, and the net break.
[43:32] And they beckoned into the partners
[43:33] which were other ship, and they should
[43:35] come out and help them, and they came
[43:36] and filled both the ships so that they
[43:38] began to sink. Now remember, they ain't
[43:40] they fished all night long, but now
[43:42] because they listen to God's word, they
[43:44] got a big catch. Amen. I don't care.
[43:46] What come your life? Come in your life.
[43:47] You take God's word, you'll see the
[43:49] supernatural power of God in your life.
[43:50] Amen. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell
[43:53] down on Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart
[43:54] from me, for I'm a sinful man of of I'm
[43:57] a sinful man, oh Lord, for he astonished
[43:59] and all that was with him at the drop of
[44:00] the fishes what they had taken." And so
[44:02] was James and John the son of Zeb in the
[44:05] apartment of Simon. And Jesus said unto
[44:06] him, Simon, fear not, for henceforth
[44:09] thou shalt catch men. May God be your
[44:12] word. May we see this morning. Amen.
[44:13] Amen.
[44:15] So taking God at his word. Amen. How how
[44:18] many want to take God's word this
[44:19] morning? Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; When you when you take God at his word,
[44:21] you always to see the supernatural power
[44:23] of God. Amen. The only thing you can
[44:25] really trust in his hour, Amen, is
[44:26] revealed word of the hour. Amen. So I
[44:29] think about how the Bible says never I
[44:32] think the part says I let the part get
[44:33] up deal with say nevertheless at thy
[44:36] will
[44:38] &gt;&gt; at thy word, oh Lord. Amen. I'm going
[44:41] I'm going to the next scripture, but say
[44:42] nevertheless at thy word I will let down
[44:45] the net.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a nevertheless mean, let me
[44:48] read this. This read this definition for
[44:50] you. Nevertheless, amen. The
[44:52] nevertheless means is like a change, a
[44:54] mindset change. So a nevertheless, the
[44:57] word nevertheless means it also means so
[44:59] be it or or as it is or not the same or
[45:01] or what difference does it make? But I'm
[45:02] going to get the point. A never a
[45:04] nevertheless means a transition from one
[45:06] idea or situation to another. Often
[45:09] highlighting a contrast or shift in
[45:12] perspective, especially from a human
[45:14] limitation. from a human limitations to
[45:16] the God's power. So, so I'm I'm taking a
[45:20] point where he remember Simon was born a
[45:23] fisherman. He had fished all night long.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But now this is the morning time where
[45:28] Jesus say, "Simon, I'm I'm I'mma pre I'm
[45:30] I'mma use your ship this morning to
[45:32] preach the word." So, I'm going to go
[45:35] whatever you give God, you'll be
[45:36] blessed. Amen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; That's why you want to give God your
[45:38] money.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. your time, your whatever you give
[45:42] God, God can he can take a little and
[45:43] make a lot out of it. Amen. Amen. So you
[45:45] whatever your God God with your body,
[45:47] your mind and your soul. Amen.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; God want all of you. Amen. And once God
[45:52] give you give you whatever you give my
[45:54] thing, whatever you give to God, God
[45:56] will bless it. Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; How many How many like a return on the
[46:00] investment? Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; But a lot of time you can put you can
[46:03] put in the stock market and you lose
[46:04] money. Amen. But in God, you never lose.
[46:07] Amen. How many God don't he don't
[46:09] remember God don't add he multiplies.
[46:11] Amen. So what point is this whatever you
[46:14] give to God will bless it.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; You realize I remember but how that
[46:21] Simon I mean like that I'm just feeling
[46:23] good man that that that that Samson gave
[46:26] God his strength but gave Elila his
[46:29] heart.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; But God give every Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; But God want all of you. Amen. Amen. My
[46:35] main point is for the young people also.
[46:36] Whatever you give God, God will bless
[46:38] it.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; It may be, oh in school, y'all in school
[46:42] now. Like I tell my daughters, you in
[46:43] school, I know you under pressure. I
[46:46] know that this this is s you are living
[46:48] in Satan's Eden.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; That's why you must be in the word of
[46:52] God.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; That's why you must let the word of God
[46:55] come inside you. How many know how many
[46:56] know how many people say that God keeps
[46:58] his word?
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Does God keep his word?
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Now, if that word's inside you, can God
[47:05] keep you? Amen. Everybody say if if you
[47:07] if you abide in me and my what words
[47:09] abide in you, ask what you will. Amen.
[47:12] So the word inside you, God will keep
[47:15] you. Amen. In the midst of Satan, in mid
[47:18] troubles, by all your trials, if the
[47:20] word is there, God will keep the word.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; But you must keep the word. Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Cuz in this I'm tell everything else
[47:27] going to fail you. But one thing, the
[47:28] word of God. Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, so, so it say he says,
[47:32] "And nevertheless, at thy word, I will
[47:35] cast down thy net." Amen.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Also, let's go to St. Matthew
[47:38] right quick, man. I ain't going to be
[47:39] long. I want you to get a report.
[47:41] Whenever God tell you to do something is
[47:43] contrary sometimes to your natural
[47:45] belief,
[47:46] &gt;&gt; to your natural mind. So, that's why the
[47:48] Bible say you must have the mind of
[47:50] Christ.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; So, the mind of Christ, the mind,
[47:52] remember the Holy Ghost wrote the word.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost will believe all the
[47:57] word. Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; So if God says do if God say like I say
[48:01] the Bible told them go over once. He
[48:03] told the children to go over once and
[48:05] possess the land at once. I have given
[48:07] you the land.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; When God say he can do something, you
[48:10] can do it. Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Just take God at his word. Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; So say go to St. Matthew 26 right quick
[48:16] in verse 39. It's very familiar. So
[48:18] never he said nevertheless. So so Simon
[48:20] knew I'm a fisherman. I done fish all
[48:23] night long. Me. So, but he knew he was
[48:25] dealing with when he saw when he took
[48:27] God at his word and we had he had he had
[48:30] enough fish that they had two ships to
[48:31] come out. He knew he wasn't dealing with
[48:32] a man. He was dealing with a he was
[48:34] dealing with God almighty. Amen.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And when you take God's word and see God
[48:37] does signs and wonders and powers and
[48:39] supernatural things, you know that you
[48:41] serve a real God. Amen.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; So, so I want to read it again. Uh when
[48:46] you say nevertheless means a transition
[48:48] from one idea or situation to another
[48:51] often highlight a contrast or shift in
[48:53] perspective especially from a human
[48:56] limitations to God's power or God's
[48:58] will.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Also means nevertheless nevertheless
[49:02] with God is always more than enough.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; So you may not you may I say always pay
[49:09] your tithes and offering.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when you when you take God
[49:13] at his word, God's obligated to keep his
[49:15] word. Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; God tell I pay I rob Peter to pay Paul,
[49:19] but I ain't robbing Jesus to pay nobody.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; I rob Peter to pay Paul, but I ain't
[49:26] robbing Jesus to pay nobody. Amen. He
[49:28] going to get his first. Amen. And
[49:30] everybody else can get the left on him,
[49:31] but God get his first. God will keep his
[49:34] word. Amen. And ever since I paid, ever
[49:36] since I put put my trust in and counted
[49:38] God, God had not failed me. Not one
[49:41] time. Amen. It got low sometimes, but it
[49:44] never ran out. Amen. Why? Because God
[49:46] keeps his word. Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Don't put your trust
[49:50] in your money. You better put your trust
[49:51] in our money. God. Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say Matthew 26. Amen. Verse 39.
[49:56] Now, here's Jesus. How many know Jesus
[49:57] was a He was He was just as much man as
[50:00] he was God.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; He was Jesus at Gethsemane. He's at his
[50:03] greatest trial. Say he pap say he got
[50:05] his victory at G. He had to overcome his
[50:08] own natural ability. I remember his
[50:10] flesh did not want to go to the cross.
[50:12] Amen. But thank God he you was on his
[50:15] mind. Amen. But the Bible verse 20 39
[50:18] says and he went a little farther and
[50:21] fell on his face and prayed saying oh my
[50:24] father if it be possible let this cup
[50:27] pass from me. He did not want to go. The
[50:30] flesh the flesh did not cuz no man every
[50:33] man want to live. Amen. The flesh did
[50:36] not want to go. Amen. But thank God when
[50:39] the Holy Ghost is inside, he overrides
[50:41] everything. Amen. Verse next verse says,
[50:43] "Nevertheless, as I will, not as I will,
[50:47] but as thou will." So who who was he
[50:48] talking to? He was talking to the God
[50:50] inside him. The word inside him gave him
[50:53] the overcoming power for that situation.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; The word inside you, we can overcome a
[50:58] power overcome power in every situation.
[51:01] Amen. Cuz the word of God will defeat
[51:04] the devil any place, anytime, under any
[51:06] situation. Amen. Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; That's why the word of God must be
[51:09] inside you. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; It's good for you to have this word
[51:12] right here, but this word right here
[51:14] will do you no good if it don't come
[51:15] inside your soul. Amen.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; The word must become flesh. Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Nevertheless, not my will, but
[51:22] thy will be done."
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; One, let me show you one more thing. And
[51:25] nevertheless, the term nevertheless, so
[51:27] nevertheless from the can go from the
[51:29] positive to the negative or from the
[51:32] negative to the positive. It's all
[51:34] because how your perspective will help
[51:36] when you in a certain situation. Amen.
[51:38] So numbers numbers numbers chapter 13 if
[51:41] we will. Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; So how many going to say no nevertheless
[51:45] at thy word Lord.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; That's my desire. Know I don't care what
[51:48] come my life you going to take God over
[51:50] every situation. Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Numbers 13:26.
[51:56] It says, "And they went and came to
[51:57] Moses and to Aaron and to all the
[52:00] congregation of the children of Israel
[52:01] and to the mids of Paran Kadesh and
[52:03] brought back word unto them that all
[52:05] congregation showed them the fruit of
[52:07] the land." How many know when God say
[52:08] you if God say the land is full of
[52:10] honey, that's true. Amen.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever God word say is true. Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; If God say you going to have a bride, he
[52:17] got a bride.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; If God say going to be a rapture, there
[52:20] going to be a rapture. Amen. And God say
[52:21] he going to take care of you, he going
[52:22] to take care of you. Amen. I ain't
[52:24] trusting in Trump. I ain't trusting
[52:26] Snap. I'm trusting Almighty God.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I ain't trusting Medicaid. I ain't
[52:31] trusting this. I'm trusting in Almighty
[52:33] God. I'm trusting Jehovah Gy. You may
[52:37] take this. You may take that, but you
[52:39] can't take the word. Amen. So trust in
[52:41] the word. Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; You may take my social security. You may
[52:47] take take my 401k, but you can't take
[52:49] the spoken word. Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But take my snap. Amen. I
[52:53] need I need God. Amen.
[52:56] Oh, they going to take my snap. They
[52:57] going to say, "I got God."
[52:59] &gt;&gt; I said, "I got God." Remember, the same
[53:02] God that led the children of Israel is
[53:04] the same God that lead us right now. The
[53:08] Bible said they closed their way out.
[53:10] Their shoes their way out. They had
[53:12] food. They had water. They had
[53:14] everything. Amen. Why? They trusted in
[53:16] God. And that same God is here right
[53:18] now, man. Taking care of the pride.
[53:20] Amen. Trust in God. Amen. Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz everything else will fail you.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; On this big beautiful bill, I'm losing
[53:31] my losing some hours, but you still got
[53:33] your God.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; I'm losing my benefits, but you still
[53:36] got your God.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that God will be the
[53:40] man? Say, "The Lord is my shepherd."
[53:42] Amen. I shall not want. Amen. He shall
[53:46] be thy man. Have faith in God. Praise
[53:50] God. Amen. He always he's he's better
[53:53] than old star. He's always there.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; He's better than stay forms like a good
[54:00] neighbor. He's always there. Cuz like I
[54:02] say, you get enough existence, stay
[54:04] firm, we'll drop you. Amen. But I know a
[54:07] man who's always there. Amen. His name
[54:09] is Jesus Christ. Amen.
[54:12] Like a good neighbor. Stay farm is
[54:14] there. That's a lie.
[54:16] Get four axes in the road. They'll drop
[54:17] like a hot kick. Amen. I'm a living
[54:20] witness. Amen.
[54:22] They will drop you like a hot kick.
[54:24] Amen. But I know a man.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; I know a man who's faithful than you.
[54:29] Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Verse 27 says, "And they told him and
[54:36] said, we came into the land where thou
[54:38] sent us, and surely it flowth with milk
[54:42] and white." You know why? Because God
[54:43] word says so.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Flow milk and honey. And the and and
[54:47] that the fruit of it. But verse 28 says,
[54:50] "Nevertheless,"
[54:52] this what he messed up at the positive
[54:55] shift to a negative
[54:57] &gt;&gt; because of instead of looking at the
[54:58] prompts, they look at the situation.
[55:00] Never look at the situation.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Never look at the condition. Always look
[55:06] at the word. Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; So, never let the people be strong that
[55:12] How many know how many know that God

[1:07:03] That's my right.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; That's the age we live in
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; where people have their own rights.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; But we just like Christ. We don't want
[1:07:10] our own rights. We want God's rights.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Not my will, but thy will be done. Lord,
[1:07:14] Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; For you to really go somewhere with God,
[1:07:17] high God, you must deny yourself
