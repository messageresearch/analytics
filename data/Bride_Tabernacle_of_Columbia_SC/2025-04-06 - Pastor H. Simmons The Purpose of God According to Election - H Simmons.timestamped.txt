[36:45] Lord. Lord, we know that destruction in
[36:48] the land, God is going to move his hand.
[36:52] Oh God, as we see the storms and
[36:55] tornadoes
[36:56] and Lord, oh your mercy, oh God, the
[37:00] floods and all that's hitting
[37:03] America, the changes within the
[37:06] political
[37:07] realm, Father, the turmoil that's going
[37:10] on in the
[37:12] world, but well Lord,
[37:15] we we can't put our
[37:18] confidence in this world, but Lord, we
[37:20] look to You
[37:23] said lead me. Guide me.
[37:27] That's what we need. Lord, you to lead
[37:29] us.
[37:32] Father, for you
[37:33] know what we need. Hallelujah. Father
[37:38] God, we thank you for the hands that
[37:39] were lifted and oh God that the needs
[37:42] Lord that you can
[37:44] meet. Father, those that on the prayer
[37:47] list this morning,
[37:49] God, may you touch their lives,
[37:52] may you minister to each and every
[37:54] individual, Lord. Lord Jesus, Father
[37:57] God, may you move by your
[38:00] spirit, may you break yolks and pull
[38:03] down strongholds.
[38:05] [Music]
[38:07] Oh God, in every imagination that exalt
[38:09] itself against the knowledge of
[38:12] God, may oh God, you cause your word to
[38:15] become life and alive to each and every
[38:19] one of
[38:20] us. Save, heal, and
[38:23] deliver. Bless us now,
[38:26] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[38:30] Amen.
[38:32] Romans 9 and we said we going to pick up
[38:36] at the 11th verse but I'm going to
[38:38] backtrack a
[38:39] little to the
[38:41] eighth. That is they which
[38:45] are the children of the
[38:48] flesh. These are not the children of
[38:50] God. They first these are not the
[38:53] children of God. But the children of the
[38:56] promise are counted for the what? Seed.
[38:59] Seed. For this is the word of
[39:03] promise. At this time will I come and
[39:08] Sarah shall have a
[39:11] son. And not only this, but when Rebecca
[39:16] also had conceited by one, even by our
[39:20] father
[39:23] Isaac, for the children being not what?
[39:27] yet more neither having done any good or
[39:31] what? Evil, that the purpose of God
[39:34] according to election might what? Might
[39:38] stand not of works, but of him that
[39:42] call.
[39:45] It was said unto her, the elders shall
[39:49] what? Serve the younger. It is written,
[39:52] Jacob have I what? Love, but Esau have I
[39:58] What shall we say
[40:01] then? Is there unrighteousness with God?
[40:06] God
[40:07] forbid. For he said to Moses, I will
[40:10] have what? Mercy on whom I will have
[40:13] mercy. And I will have compassion on
[40:17] whom I will have compassion.
[40:20] So then it is not of him that what
[40:25] nor him that what
[40:28] but God that what? Mercy. May God bless
[40:31] you. Read those words. You may be seated
[40:33] and we thank God for you. Amen. Amen.
[40:36] Hallelujah. So I'm saying the purpose of
[40:38] God according to the election might
[40:41] stand.
[40:43] The purpose of God according to the
[40:46] election might stand.
[40:49] Amen. God has a
[40:52] purpose and his purpose will stand.
[40:56] Hallelujah. It doesn't matter who you
[40:57] are. It doesn't matter what you're doing
[41:00] and where you're going.
[41:03] God has a
[41:06] purpose. God's purpose according to the
[41:12] election. You might say, "Well, what is
[41:15] election?" And when we break it down and
[41:18] talk about the
[41:20] elect, we're talking about the those
[41:23] that have been picked
[41:25] out, those that have been
[41:29] chosen, the
[41:31] purpose of
[41:33] God according to election.
[41:40] Jesus said, "You've not chosen me,
[41:44] but I chose you."
[41:46] Amen. Amen. And he said, "No man can
[41:50] come to me except my father." What? Draw
[41:54] him. Amen. So, we got to realize you're
[41:58] not here by coincidence. God has a
[42:02] purpose for you being here this morning.
[42:06] And while you're here, you need to find
[42:08] out. I ask God, why am I here? Because
[42:11] somebody invited me because this is the
[42:14] church that I go to. Or do God has a
[42:17] plan and a purpose?
[42:21] He has a plan and a purpose for you
[42:24] being here.
[42:26] You let you be born at a certain time,
[42:29] in a certain season. Yes. Because God
[42:32] had a purpose in you being born at this
[42:35] season, in this time. Amen.
[42:37] said, "For everything there is a season,
[42:40] there's a time, and there's a purpose."
[42:42] Yes.
[42:44] Amen. To everything that's under the
[42:47] sun. Amen.
[42:49] So, by the grace of God, we
[42:51] come, we want to find out. And I wonder,
[42:55] you know, some 50 years ago, wonder why
[42:59] I I I love these scriptures so much.
[43:03] And I was preaching it, you know, back
[43:07] 50 years ago and seemed like the people
[43:10] were somewhat
[43:12] lost. They they they they were saying,
[43:14] "Uh uh, you uh we don't know what you
[43:17] what you're trying to do. What are you
[43:20] preaching?"
[43:22] Because at that time as a whole people
[43:26] wasn't dealing with God's fornowledge
[43:30] and predestination and going into that.
[43:33] Amen. They thought that this you could
[43:37] not you had to make your own decision
[43:39] and choice and that is right. It does
[43:42] not
[43:43] conflict with God election and God's
[43:47] forn knowledge and God's predestination.
[43:50] It does not
[43:52] conflict. It's just that when the
[43:54] opening of the seals and the opening of
[43:56] the word, I began to understand it in in
[44:00] a deeper uh way and a simplified way,
[44:03] but it was a deeper way.
[44:06] Amen. At that time, I was just doving
[44:09] into it as a young man and as a young
[44:11] minister. I was just uh you know ju just
[44:15] excited
[44:17] because I knew that within me I felt
[44:20] like these things meant something to me.
[44:24] Amen. It it meant that I was
[44:27] predestinated that that God had chose
[44:30] me. Amen. It just didn't start then.
[44:35] But in uh Ephesians 1, uh it it just
[44:41] didn't start. God has a purpose of God
[44:44] according to election. And uh Paul
[44:47] picked it up in the terminology of
[44:50] Ephesians here. Amen. And and it seemed
[44:54] a little strange and may not resonate
[44:56] with you and may not mean much to you,
[44:58] but it meant so much to me as a young
[45:00] Christian that Amen. that God had a plan
[45:03] for my life. Amen. And I found out that
[45:07] uh I wasn't to be a a football star,
[45:11] this or that. Amen. I I wasn't to be uh
[45:14] the or that, but God had a plan.
[45:18] Yes, I had a plan and I had some goals
[45:21] and things that I wanted to achieve and
[45:24] the way I wanted to go and God wasn't so
[45:26] much in the forefront of it. Lord, are
[45:30] you up with me? Amen. But there's a
[45:32] purpose and a plan for your life.
[45:37] Amen. But you got to come on one accord
[45:39] with God. But if not, then the world
[45:42] doesn't mean much to you. It just that
[45:45] we come to church because that's the
[45:47] thing we do.
[45:49] Amen. That's what we do. We go to church
[45:52] on Sunday. That's what we do. We go to
[45:55] church through the week. A Amen. But I
[45:57] don't really it does not really mean
[46:00] that much to me. Uh I I don't know the
[46:03] value of it. But uh you know that's if I
[46:06] want to go to heaven I just do these
[46:08] things
[46:10] you know. But really really
[46:13] understanding really having a a passion
[46:16] for the things of God. Really having a
[46:20] love for the things of God. Amen.
[46:22] There's no love there. You know, you
[46:24] know, you can even marry somebody and
[46:27] don't love them. Amen. Bless you, Jesus.
[46:29] You go and get the marriage license, but
[46:31] you don't love them. You don't care
[46:33] about them. You love them because it's
[46:37] convenient. Maybe your friend got
[46:39] married. Maybe everybody around you.
[46:41] Maybe you was getting
[46:43] old and left out. I got to catch me
[46:47] whoever I can catch
[46:48] now and just go on get married to
[46:51] somebody. But there's no love
[46:54] there. Amen. Let let me just get what I
[46:58] can. I might end up with nothing.
[47:02] See, some folk do things just to get by
[47:06] in life.
[47:08] Amen. Just that I don't want to look
[47:10] like other folk look. I don't want to
[47:12] look like an old maid. I don't want I
[47:15] want things.
[47:18] See, but God has a purpose and a plan.
[47:21] Yeah, sometime we feel in the natural.
[47:24] That's how we feel about our spiritual
[47:26] soul.
[47:29] Let me go to church somewhere. Let me
[47:31] set up under ministry. I believe I want
[47:34] to do
[47:35] this. Some folks say, "I believe I want
[47:37] to be a preacher, but don't qualify by
[47:39] no scripture."
[47:43] And if you go to the right church, it
[47:45] doesn't make a difference.
[47:48] You can go ahead and preach,
[47:50] but the stretcher condemns you. Amen.
[47:54] But Amen. You you're accepted.
[47:58] Amen. And we want to be accepted by uh
[48:01] by the world or by the church or by
[48:04] Amen. a certain ministry. But we uh No.
[48:07] But when it comes down to the word, the
[48:10] word condemns us. Amen. And when it's
[48:13] all over, you're going to be judged by
[48:15] the word. Amen. God has a purpose.
[48:19] Amen. The prophet God was talking about
[48:21] hearing, recognizing, and acting upon
[48:23] the
[48:24] word. Are you with me?
[48:28] You know, we have uh Amen. the the the
[48:31] spiritual man or woman today. And then
[48:34] we have, Amen. the the the the the
[48:37] natural man a woman today. Amen.
[48:41] So, as we're dealing with the natural
[48:44] and and the spiritual, the spiritual,
[48:47] amen, uh a woman, a a man is the elected
[48:51] one. Amen. Is the predestinated of God
[48:55] that comes to eternal life.
[48:58] Are you with me? Those are the ones that
[49:01] come to eternal life because they are
[49:03] spiritual. Amen. It's a spiritual woman.
[49:06] It's a spiritual man. And it comes to
[49:10] amen eternal life. Amen. But the natural
[49:14] man, Amen,
[49:15] is
[49:17] Amen. It goes to church and he's the
[49:21] corner
[49:22] man. Are you with me? Everything is
[49:25] about
[49:27] connality. I I I find folk uh get mad at
[49:32] me because they have I want to do this.
[49:36] I don't see no reason why, but I want to
[49:39] see what what the purpose of it. Well,
[49:43] everybody doing
[49:45] it, and I wonder why we can't do
[49:48] it. You know what I'm saying? But
[49:50] there's no no spiritual significance.
[49:54] There's nothing to cause folk to come to
[49:57] Christ and to love him more and to get
[50:00] closer to him. But we just go through
[50:02] the motion. uh we just do things uh
[50:05] almost it's it's almost like a uh we we
[50:08] we're so interested in uh just being
[50:13] uhos

[50:17] buddy we got all kind of social
[50:21] programs doing all kind of social
[50:24] activities
[50:26] and we we we're interested in the social
[50:29] gospel
[50:31] we're interested in
[50:34] socializing, but we're not interested in
[50:37] the the the pure word.
[50:41] Amen. Where we Amen. where we get under
[50:43] conviction.
[50:45] Amen. Where we want God in our lives.
[50:47] Amen. We want the power of God in our
[50:50] lives. We want something to change us.

[51:26] He wanted the
[51:28] birthight and he didn't care what it
[51:31] took, but he wanted the birthright.
[51:33] Ain't that right? But uh nevertheless,
[51:37] Esau
[51:38] despise his birthright. Are you with me?
[51:41] Amen.
[51:42] See, whatever it takes for me to get the
[51:45] Holy Ghost, I want it.

[52:21] resurrection. God, I need I need a
[52:25] filling and a refilling.

[52:30] Oh, yes. We come to church when we don't
[52:32] want God.
[52:35] Amen. We come to church and we go
[52:36] through the motion.
[52:39] But we ought to come because I want God.

[1:47:44] our heart that we walk after the spirit
[1:47:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:49] Lord, we thank you, Lord Jesus, that we
[1:47:52] once again can gather in the name of the
[1:47:54] Lord Jesus Christ, giving you the glory
[1:47:55] that we're kept by your power, Lord. We
[1:47:58] just pray you just work within us to do
[1:48:00] your good pleasure, Lord Jesus, and give
[1:48:02] you the glory for all things in our
[1:48:04] life. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for
[1:48:05] blessing us exceeding and abundantly.
[1:48:07] Thank you, Lord Jesus, for just blessing
[1:48:10] us and keeping us by your power daily,
[1:48:12] Lord. We give you the glory and we thank
[1:48:14] you for it now. Jesus name we pray.
