there were hinder you from moving Lord Hexham for the forgive us now Lord bless your people now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen they will want to thank God for just watching over each and every one of us keeping us under the blood want to talk tonight about Hebrews 11 chapter the created power of the word we just try to talk to you a little bit the created power of the word the power to create the power to create since Hebrews 11:1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that the things which are seen were not made by the things which do appear I me God blessed to reduce word in Jesus name now we want to talk about by faith we understand we understand that the worlds were made by the Word of God so the world was made by the Word of God that created power of the word where God's servant speaking message spoken word is the written a seed and we understand that the spoken word is the original seed and the Bible says in Genesis one talked about the creative power of the word and he told us how the world came into existence he said in the beginning God created the heavens and earth and the earth Genesis 1 and 2 in the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of the Lord Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said it said in God said we're talking about the created power of the word and God said God spoke he said they meant by faith we understand that the worlds of frame were made by the Word of God and God said let there be light and there was life so God spoke and when he spoke let it be amen it had to be because God said it and God said something then God is able to bring it to pass he's able to manifest what he says so by the grace of God the creative power of the word but the word of God has always been as we said on Sunday the Crucified word they meant the devil has already always come against what God said as we said on Sunday that the devil always come to contradict or try to get you off for what God said because if you believe what God said there will be a manifestation amen God sent His Word to healed us he said it's word to deliver us but man amen that because of the devil amen fighting man's mind and trying to hinder men from coming accepting what God said in his word but when God said it he'll do what he said the word should not return to God ward so by the grace of God I want to go a little farther in Proverbs here proverbs 18 proverbs 18 and 21 it says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it say eat the fruit they're deaf in life in the power of the tongue the creative power of the word now you and I where do we stand if create and that word got power to create then oh and God created the heavens and earth you and I as sons and daughters of God I am with you God so you have to realize is there a mature God the power to create is within you the Bible says that the man thinking that it's hard so we see he meant that's why amen our thoughts should be pure because we understand that God destroyed the world because every imagination is thoughts of men heart was continually evil and in Genesis 6 they men to repeat God that he made the man because man was so wicked because of his imagination their thoughts he meant so man heart is so wicked and the Bible tells us out of the bunda see of the heart the mouth will speak so by the grace of God what's in your heart come out of your mouth and what's coming out your mouth you begin to act on what you speak and you begin to manifest what you believe so by the grace of God the creative power of the world we gotta be careful what we say and how we say what we say because your word is actually creating an atmosphere and you become a victim of what you say things happen to you when you believe when you speak it on yourself so oftentimes you know that as I talk about my shoes and my high blood pressure mine mine mine mine my cancer my dis a mint you speak it amen but cancer don't blow to you sugar diabetes don't belong to you it comes from the devil now you cannot accept it no matter what your body says or what's going on in your body you cannot accept it as being yours this is a demon a devil that had come to attack you but faith you got to fight the good fight of faith you got to say to that devil they meant as Jesus said to Satan get get behind me Satan they meant you got to say to that devil they meant you don't belong in my house they meant you own God's property amen I've blown to God I'm a child of God I'm a son a daughter of God you got to start talking to the situation to the situation obey to your body begin to obey your confession but too often times we stop speaking and we just accept and we accept defeat but we got to keep on believing and keep on speaking they meant until our body be our confession they meant when you give up then that's what the devil wants you to do but I'm saying death in life is in the power of the term and the creative power of God he meant because your father God he meant has given the sons and daughters powers to overcome the world amen the overcoming God has given you victory and the victory is your face for he said greater is He that's in you what is it the creative power of God is his word in you his word evening is the power to create the create event and the call those things that be not as though they are so the power of God is the word in you that's living through the Holy Ghost so the word Amen is spirit word but the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the D they meant and the Spirit of God God spirit in it that comes down in you is the word that's alive inside of you the Holy Ghost is the Living Word inside of you that lives in you that gives you a victory over every devil and every demon but if you don't have the Holy Ghost amen you begin to doubt because it's not your battle it's the law battle is He that's in you that's the greater one and he is the word and the word got power to create even the wired makes a difference praise God the word makes a difference in your life amen you just can't just sit back and relax and don't speak sometimes we just relax and say I'm gonna see what's gonna happen you've got to keep on believing and believe what you're saying speaking the creative power of the word now in first John 3 it says verse 9 3 and 1 it says behold what manner of love now remember that God is love you know just meditating upon the Lord the day and there may be to see go over somewhere and when we talk about the word man in all his achievement and sometimes our Christians in our Christian Wulff and all our achievements and all that we're trying to achieve and all that we trying to accomplish sometimes we're so mystified and we're so wanting and no distant woman no doubt and we want to be men it's almost like we're becoming our knowledge seekers the Bible said the Greeks seek out the wisdom the Jews want a sign amen when we preach Christ crucified amen sometimes it's foolish and sometimes it's a stumbling block but Christ the cross of Jesus they meant so I want to say amen Paul had to bring the gospel to simplicity bring it back to the cross and bring it back to what Jesus died to achieve and accomplish they meant because they wanted to have wisdom their warning they meant to have signs but let's bring it back to the cross everything that you he meant have everything that you need a mint and everything God has provided he provided it through redemption and in his blood when he died on the cross so God has already paid the price they meant and so we don't have nothing to try to achieve in the Gloria amen if you want to go real in its glory in the Lord what he's done for us that he redeemed us and brought us back to God back to where Adam and Eve fell into God God has given us to created power again he said here the whole what madam love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God in it now I will average of God God he meant as I say so many times if if the dog had another dog you might call it a puppy but it's still a dog and if the cat had another cat it's a cat email so if God has sons and daughters amen then we are a mature God's even so what does God do what are the what are the attributes of God amen and I want to say God is his word the Bible says and st. John warning 1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God so if you're looking at God the created power of God he met God him it was manifested in his own word they meant God revealed himself in his own words and because Christ is revealed in his own word they meant the people amen they don't see any men that they don't know who he is because he'd revealed in his own word and Jesus when he came to earth the Bible said he was in the world and the world was made by him the creator became the a creature integration he became a mint fresh in it the Bible says in st. John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and then so God even the creator in the took oh and a body and became the flesh that was the Word made flesh that was God word in flesh for are you so God in them they met made himself a flesh and he got in it he meant the word was made flesh are you with me and now I hear you and I that was sinful flesh that God comes down amen and he tell the knuckles in us in the baptism of the Holy Ghost God gets inside of us and what is it and then he is calling us to causing us to be sons and daughters of God the manifested world for the day and I are we live in amen so we're living in amen this day in this hour to manifest the word that God spoke for the state or you up me this is the day and this is the owl admit that the bride will manifest the very attributes and life of God that we come to the fullness of the headstone the capital then perfect law are you with me so it's his time in it then we put away even one lust and all of the stuff in it hinders you perfect man look at Jesus began to strive for perfection we began to press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling what is it God word is perfect converting the center are you with me so we don't have a word that doesn't have power we have a word it's God's Word and it's got power degree you said now what we created if we have the power to do it then why are we not created worlds amen there is a point of time Jesus said I can do nothing to the father show me because he had appointed time he meant to do certain things but it was not because he was Amen his limitation was only to the world so he says hey I'm gonna do what my father gave me to do amen I can't do nothing but what the father showed me to do they meant what the word has prophesied and had a dame for this day in this hour then surely the word is going to do exactly what it says and God will have a people on the earth Amen that would be a meant the manifestation of the word amen and he will dedicate those people amen has been the word bride they meant nothing that she has to do in it but believe what he said are you somebody wish to God he said now with the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not the world don't know who you are because it didn't know who Jesus was his own his own people when he came to them they could not recognize they were praying that he come people are praying amen Jesus come and God you know he descended in a shower he comes in a shout he descends and even beginning to work his work among the people and people can't see him and he began to do what he promised here to do in the last days he began to manifest himself in evening time and the evening light began to show himself by many infallible proofs they meant began to manifest his word they meant somebody got to take hold on the word and called the word to live somebody got to take a whole and say God you said it I believe it that settles it somebody got to take hold to the word and the word to come life in them not a whole lot of talk but manifestation we've had enough talking about what God can't do what God will do and what God gonna do but let's even watch what God is doing right now hey you release faith let our feet go and take home with the world it's the Lord I'm the child amen I'm your son I'm your daughter I took over the world God not you why be manifested Oh God if the word can be born in Mary suddenly the word can be born in me amen so you and I even the children in sons and daughters of God to travail amen in pain what do we call the part with our house hey

us a hope amen and the Word of God so pure and the hope that we have a mint that you and I must become the word because words gonna matter word not Church but the word amen the Bible said be ye not
