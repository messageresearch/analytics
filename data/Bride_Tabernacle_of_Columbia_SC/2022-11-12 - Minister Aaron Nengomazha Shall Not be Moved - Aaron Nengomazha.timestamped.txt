[32:49] musicians
[32:50] I always enjoy the saxophone
[32:54] that's uh and the music is really really
[32:57] wonderful
[32:58] so
[32:59] um note that I don't enjoy uh brother
[33:02] same ones as preaching but
[33:04] I show you I so enjoy the six of them so
[33:07] much I feel like it's too late for me to
[33:10] start learning it but I believe on the
[33:13] other side I'll be able to do it
[33:15] that's one of the things that I'm
[33:16] looking forward to and you're happy to
[33:19] be in the house of the Lord
[33:21] I would like to thank a pastor for
[33:24] giving me this invitation he's an elder
[33:27] and he's a man that we we really learn a
[33:32] lot from and we thank God for giving us
[33:35] pillars that we can look up to praise
[33:38] the Lord so if if we can stand and open
[33:42] our Bible in the Book of Psalms chapter
[33:45] 18 verse 32 this is a midweek service so
[33:51] um we don't want to take a lot of time
[33:54] I have a few slides here
[33:57] so um
[33:58] try to be
[34:00] as quick as possible
[34:03] but doing Justice to what the Holy
[34:05] Spirit wants us to do
[34:09] Psalms 18 verse 32 if you have it it
[34:11] reads in this wise in my Bible
[34:14] it is God that girdeth me with the
[34:17] strength
[34:18] and make it my way perfect he maketh my
[34:22] feet like hints feet and said with me
[34:25] upon my high places may God bless the
[34:29] reading of his word you may have your
[34:30] Sith
[34:32] today we want to talk about for uh a
[34:35] little time we want to talk about I
[34:37] shall not be moved
[34:39] I believe that it's every Christian's
[34:42] testimony to say I shall not be moved
[34:46] not brother sorry so he's a strong
[34:48] brother or this sister is a strong
[34:50] sister yourself as a person you have to
[34:53] have your own testimony where you can
[34:56] say I shall not be moved and the reason
[34:59] why you are not moved David here is
[35:02] saying that the Lord he makes my feet
[35:04] like the Hindus feet now if if if you
[35:08] know anything about you know these
[35:09] animals like a mountain deer right it is
[35:12] special feet I don't I don't have time
[35:14] to talk about that you can go and Google
[35:16] when you get home uh if you have Wi-Fi
[35:20] uh I'm sure you do so it is a special
[35:24] kind of feat because these deers they
[35:26] actually run in the mountains and they
[35:28] can stand on very precarious uh places
[35:32] and they are not able to fall because
[35:34] God has given them specially designed
[35:37] feet
[35:38] and hear the Bible David is saying God
[35:41] has given me feet like the hints feet
[35:44] and he has set me upon the high places
[35:47] so God does two things he gives you the
[35:50] right kind of fit and he sets you on the
[35:53] right kind of plateau praise the Lord
[35:55] you can have the right kind of feet but
[35:58] if God does not set you on the right
[36:01] place you're going to have problems and
[36:04] even if you have you can you can be set
[36:06] on the right place but if you don't have
[36:08] the right kind of fit you're gonna have
[36:10] problems so this tonight you want
[36:13] Christians that have the right kind of
[36:15] feet and whom God can take and set them
[36:19] on a high place because a deer when it's
[36:22] on the high place it's safe from from
[36:24] from from from uh from from from the the
[36:27] Lions it's it's safe from the you know
[36:30] the wild bears it's safe from all these
[36:32] things that try to kill the deer when
[36:34] it's on the high place so when we are on
[36:37] the high place in Christ Jesus we are
[36:40] safe from serpents we are safe from the
[36:43] devourers we are safe from the things
[36:45] that fly under Earth praise the Lord
[36:47] some of the things that trouble us is
[36:50] because of our Dimension we need to come
[36:53] a little higher the Bible says that John
[36:56] says I Heard a Voice say to me come up
[36:58] higher sometimes you just have to come
[37:01] up higher sometimes you need to come up
[37:03] higher higher than the gossip you need
[37:06] to go a little higher than the last of
[37:09] this world when you come up higher in
[37:11] prayer in Christ Jesus
[37:13] the Bible says in the book of Ephesians
[37:15] that we are in Heavenly places in Christ
[37:18] Jesus our mindset is not here on Earth
[37:21] our mindset is set on things above
[37:24] our thinking our hearts is not here on
[37:27] Earth our hearts and our minds are in
[37:30] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[37:33] praise be to God when we come to church
[37:35] we are not looking at the next outfit
[37:37] that the brother is wearing when we are
[37:39] coming to church we are not thinking
[37:40] about the natural things that we are
[37:43] thinking about Jesus Christ we are
[37:45] thinking about the rapture we are
[37:47] thinking that one day in a moment in the
[37:50] trickle of an eye we shall be changed
[37:53] praise be to God that's where our
[37:55] affection is
[37:57] we are not in a competition who is
[37:59] driving the best car we are not looking
[38:01] for the best uh uh you know level right
[38:04] who has a Gucci all those things are
[38:07] fine but we are not setting our minds on
[38:10] those things our minds are in Heavenly
[38:13] places
[38:14] praise be to God if if a man buys a
[38:18] nicer car I say I bless God for giving
[38:20] that brother a car if God gives my
[38:22] sister a beautiful wedding I bless God
[38:25] for giving my sister a wonderful wedding
[38:26] I am not competing with anyone I am
[38:29] competing with myself because I have to
[38:32] die in Christ that I may live together
[38:35] with him
[38:36] praise be to God
[38:38] we have seen so many people fall in
[38:41] these last days and indeed we keep we
[38:44] keep seeing them falling
[38:46] I was you know looking at the news they
[38:49] say Carson has fallen to the Russians
[38:51] you know I I I don't uh Donetsk has
[38:55] fallen to the Russians people falling in
[38:57] other words the city has been has been
[38:59] besieged it has been taken over
[39:03] and and here to everything that God
[39:06] makes my feet like that like the deer to
[39:09] the extent that I am not easily shaken I
[39:13] can make mistakes I can have problems
[39:16] but I stand in Christ and In Christ
[39:18] Alone
[39:20] praise be to God
[39:21] there are winds that come upon the Earth
[39:24] there are wings that come in our lives
[39:26] but those winds are not meant to move us
[39:29] from our place as Christians we have to
[39:31] be established in Jesus Christ
[39:35] the Bible says in Psalm chapter 1 amen
[39:38] that delighted himself in the law of the
[39:41] Lord he shall be like a tree planted by
[39:43] the rivers of water you are planted in
[39:46] Jesus Christ you are not easily shaken
[39:49] by the things that fly in the world you
[39:52] are not shaken by things that happen on
[39:55] the outside because you are Faith you
[39:58] are planted upon the solid rock
[40:00] Hallelujah because that therefore what
[40:04] he tries to do is to shake you from your
[40:06] place
[40:07] remember the devil is out there to shake
[40:10] you from a place let's read a scripture
[40:12] here the Bible says in Acts chapter 20
[40:14] verse 22 now this is Paul saying he says
[40:17] Now Behold I go Bound in in the spirit
[40:19] and to Jerusalem so Paul was going to
[40:22] Jerusalem he says not knowing the things
[40:25] that shall come as that shall befall me
[40:28] there
[40:28] save the Holy Ghost witness in every
[40:31] city saying that bones afflictions abide
[40:34] me
[40:36] supposing that the Holy Spirit
[40:38] testifying through the gifts of the
[40:41] prophecies remember agap when he when he
[40:44] when he found Paul and he bound him by
[40:46] by a bell by his belt and that's the
[40:48] owner of this bear shall be bound in
[40:50] Jerusalem
[40:51] so this was not the enemy talking about
[40:54] the troubles that Paul shall face it was
[40:57] the Holy Spirit that was telling Paul
[41:00] the troubles that he is going to face
[41:03] praise God and sometimes we think that
[41:06] if the holy spirit is there it's just
[41:07] going to tell us wonderful things
[41:09] that's not always the case
[41:12] sometimes the Holy Spirit testifies of
[41:14] evil things that shall come before us
[41:16] but one thing that I love about the Holy
[41:18] Spirit is that he will be there with me
[41:21] Hallelujah David says though I walk
[41:24] through the valley of the shadow of
[41:26] death I shall fear no evil because thou
[41:29] art with me
[41:31] praise be to God
[41:32] verse 24 he says but none of these
[41:36] things move me tell your neighbor none
[41:38] of these things move me sickness doesn't
[41:40] move me finances doesn't move me
[41:43] temptations that doesn't move me I am
[41:46] standing on the rock of Jesus Christ
[41:49] Hallelujah
[41:51] Paul was not the kind of man if he's
[41:53] given a prophecy you're going to be
[41:54] bound in Jerusalem he starts to think
[41:57] about his calling he starts to doubt
[41:59] himself he starts to doubt his
[42:01] experience he's a man who says None of
[42:04] these things move me
[42:06] sometimes you need to look at your
[42:08] situation and prophesy I'm saying none
[42:10] of these things shall move me sometimes
[42:12] you see your children going back to the
[42:14] world the devil is after your faith the
[42:18] devil is after you experience but you
[42:20] must be able to say none of these things
[42:22] can move me
[42:23] Hallelujah sometimes you see bills
[42:26] piling up upon your door sometimes
[42:29] you've seen it notifications from your
[42:30] back saying your credit score has gone
[42:33] down your credit score has gone down you
[42:36] must be able to say none of these things
[42:37] above me because I have my trust in
[42:40] Jehovah I don't trust in horses I don't
[42:43] trust and Cheerios I trust in Jesus
[42:46] Christ Hallelujah
[42:49] from whence cometh my help my help comes
[42:52] from the Lord
[42:55] God is able to do
[42:58] that's what she said he will do he's
[43:00] gonna fulfill it Paul says I know that
[43:03] my God I know that my God he is able to
[43:07] fulfill what I've committed unto him
[43:09] against that day
[43:11] Hallelujah these were testimonies that
[43:13] were not given by someone who was in a
[43:15] palace these were statements that were
[43:18] spoken by someone who was in a Roman
[43:20] prison
[43:21] and people when they read post letters
[43:24] they thought he was a fanatic imagine
[43:26] someone who is bound and is in prison
[43:29] and he says None of these things move me
[43:31] I'm not worried we are more I'm we are
[43:34] more than conquerors people think that
[43:37] thoughts Powers lose his mind
[43:39] imagine a man who had no family he had
[43:42] left everything he was in a Roman prison
[43:45] he had nothing and one quote and he was
[43:48] writing beautiful letters we are more
[43:51] than conquerors through Jesus Christ who
[43:53] loved us we are sitting in Heavenly
[43:55] places in Christ Jesus the love of God
[43:58] he was talking about the love of God he
[44:02] never moved from his testimony
[44:04] praise be to God and Abraham despite all
[44:08] the challenges that he went through the
[44:10] Bible says that he stuck at not at the
[44:12] promise of God through unbelief no
[44:14] matter what you got through my brother
[44:16] hold on to the promise of God
[44:19] Hallelujah
[44:22] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 27 the Bible
[44:24] says and this word yet what's more
[44:27] signifies the removing of things that
[44:30] are shaken as of things that are made
[44:33] that those things which cannot be shaken
[44:36] May remain so God was prophesying
[44:39] through Paul that he was going to shake
[44:42] the heavens again remember before you
[44:45] harvest your wheat it has to go through
[44:48] threshing it has to go through sifting
[44:51] when it's being sifted the chaff will go
[44:53] by the window but the seat will remain
[44:56] When Trials Come praise be to God they
[45:00] make believers they leave the church
[45:01] they will live the word of God they live
[45:03] the message of the hour but the sons of
[45:06] God they remain with the word of God no
[45:09] matter what the situation might be they
[45:11] stand with the promise of Jesus Christ
[45:14] Hallelujah one time Jesus Christ said
[45:17] unless a man eat my flesh and drink my
[45:19] blood he has no life
[45:22] and multitude left him
[45:24] and he tempted to the disciples he says
[45:26] do you want to live also and Peter says
[45:29] to whom shall we go oh Lord only you
[45:32] have the words of eternal life
[45:34] Jesus stated say the statement and he
[45:38] did not explain it if he did it that
[45:40] time he can do it again wash because he
[45:44] is not interested in in multitude he is
[45:47] interested in the seed that was planted
[45:51] before the foundations of the world are
[45:53] you a seed tonight are you a seat
[45:55] tonight saying none of these things move
[45:58] me
[45:58] praise be to God
[46:01] think of Paul when he was when he was
[46:03] two weeks on the sea and you know the
[46:06] Shipwreck and there was there was no
[46:08] light there was Darkness you know a
[46:10] shipwreck is something that is very bad
[46:13] you know if you have a car wreck you
[46:15] know that maybe someone someone another
[46:17] car is gonna come through maybe someone
[46:19] will see your lights you know but in
[46:22] shipwreck you're in the middle of
[46:23] nowhere
[46:25] there is zero out of a hundred chances
[46:29] that someone is going to come by your
[46:30] way that's how bad a shipwreck is but
[46:34] Paul says fear not says be of good cheer
[46:37] the Angel by whom I stand stood with me
[46:40] this night
[46:42] Hallelujah what am I saying I'm
[46:44] encouraging you to to prove to to
[46:46] testify and say none of these things
[46:48] move me I shall not be moved because the
[46:52] devil wants to move you from your
[46:54] position
[46:55] our position is in our testimony
[46:57] remember the Bible says in the Book of
[47:00] Revelations they overcame the beasts by
[47:03] the blood of the lamb and the testimony
[47:05] of their mouth the devil wants you to
[47:08] change your testimony but you must keep
[47:11] your testimony say I believe God I
[47:14] believe Jesus I am going in the rapture
[47:18] Hallelujah there's an old song that we
[47:20] used to sing I'm going up yonder I'm
[47:23] going up yonder I'm going in the Rapture
[47:25] I'm going in the rapture
[47:27] praise God
[47:29] the Bible says which cannot be shaken
[47:32] May remain therefore we receiving a
[47:36] kingdom which cannot be moved we cannot
[47:40] be moved by covet we cannot be moved by
[47:42] Wars or rumors of wars we cannot be
[47:45] moved by fine by recessions we cannot be
[47:48] moved by by the Fashions of the world we
[47:51] have received a kingdom that cannot be
[47:54] shaken
[47:55] Peter says we are born of an
[47:57] Incorruptible seat
[48:00] there are no amount of drugs that come
[48:02] in the streets that can corrupt a Son of
[48:05] God they are no amount of challenges
[48:07] that can come that can corrupt a Son of
[48:09] God you may have your ups and downs you
[48:12] can make your mistakes but you will
[48:14] still come back to Jesus
[48:17] Abraham light
[48:19] any state of ability
[48:21] that Sarah is my sister
[48:23] but God did not look at that when the
[48:27] Divine account was being written in
[48:28] Hebrews he says Abraham staggered not at
[48:32] the promise of God through through
[48:34] unbelief when you come to the end of the
[48:36] journey he will understand and say Well
[48:39] done my faithful servant you understand
[48:41] it say Well done my sister you will
[48:44] understand and say Well done my daughter
[48:46] praise God our mistakes mean nothing
[48:50] before the Lord
[48:52] when we love with all our hearts don't
[48:54] say well I've made a mistake therefore
[48:56] I'm going back to the world forever
[48:58] it just shows that you always love the
[49:00] world if you make a mistake you make it
[49:02] right you come back to church
[49:04] and you continue walking with Jesus
[49:07] praise be to God
[49:09] even when you are married you can't make
[49:11] a mistake and say okay I'm I'm getting a
[49:13] divorce you you probably had your
[49:15] preconceived ideas if you make a mistake
[49:18] in marriage you sit down you talk it
[49:20] over you pray and you move forward
[49:22] that's the same way in church you make a
[49:25] mistake you talk it together with the
[49:27] Lord and you move forward
[49:29] and when God looks at your record he
[49:31] doesn't look at your ups and downs
[49:33] praise be to God
[49:35] you know it's like
[49:37] I I I I'm not a football fan but
[49:40] you know when they talk about things
[49:42] that happen they say okay this team won
[49:45] the championship
[49:47] this team is the champion
[49:49] no man talks about wow how they almost
[49:51] lost that game no one talks about how
[49:54] they had those injuries during their
[49:56] season no one talks about some of the
[49:58] little mistakes that they did it all
[50:00] comes down to a championship
[50:03] at the end of The Journey God is not
[50:06] going to look at your mistakes God is
[50:08] not going to look at your problems he is
[50:11] going to Crown you as a champion
[50:14] Hallelujah and the Bible says that we
[50:17] shall receive a reward if we faint not
[50:21] the goal is to come to the end of the
[50:23] journey the goal is to finish the race
[50:26] it's not how fast you can run it's not
[50:29] how slow you are going it's are you able
[50:32] to finish the race
[50:35] Paul says I fought a good fight I fit
[50:38] race
[50:39] and there lays for me a crown that the
[50:42] Lord the righteous Church shall give me
[50:45] Hallelujah he had come to the end of his
[50:48] journey
[50:49] it's not he that believes it's he that
[50:51] endures to the end so the test is on
[50:55] endurance
[50:56] praise God
[50:58] I've I've I I ran through in a marathon
[51:01] one time and when he was in high school
[51:04] so when you start there are some who go
[51:07] very fast but guess what they're not
[51:09] gonna go very far
[51:11] because they lose all their energy right
[51:13] if you find people sometimes they come
[51:16] to church they are obsessed with oh the
[51:18] pastors say this about me oh this
[51:20] brother did this you're not gonna go far
[51:23] because you are losing out your energy
[51:26] you must endure to the end keep your
[51:30] your focus on the goal keep your focus
[51:33] on the goal you know they will be when
[51:35] you are running through a marathon there
[51:37] will be arrows saying 10 left 10 right
[51:39] 10 left that's where your focus should
[51:42] be
[51:43] but if you see a man who is running a
[51:45] marathon and then they go outside this
[51:47] way they're not gonna make it just know
[51:50] for sure they're not gonna make it but
[51:52] if you keep your your eyes steady on
[51:55] Jesus
[51:56] then you will reach the goal remember
[52:00] Peter as long as he was looking at Jesus
[52:02] he was walking on top of the water but
[52:05] the moment he started to look
[52:08] sink
[52:09] praise God let's keep our eyes on Jesus
[52:13] let's keep our eyes on Calvary
[52:17] Matthew chapter 16 verse 7 Jesus Christ
[52:19] said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar
[52:23] Jonah the word bar it means the Sun
[52:26] Jonah son of Jonah for flesh and blood
[52:30] has not revealed it unto you but my
[52:33] Father which is in heaven and I say unto
[52:35] you thou Arts Peter and I point this
[52:38] rock
[52:39] I will build my church and the Gates of
[52:42] Hell shall not Prevail against it
[52:46] in other words we are set upon a rock we
[52:50] are a holy building sitting upon a rock
[52:53] the Gates of Hell will come shaking this
[52:55] way they will come check in that way but
[52:57] we shall not be moved
[53:00] Hallelujah because we are built upon the
[53:03] rock of Revelation the revelation of
[53:06] Jesus Christ not the revelation of a
[53:09] church but the revelation of Jesus
[53:12] of the denomination to fail all the
[53:15] churches who fell but Jesus never fails
[53:20] Hallelujah
[53:21] even if your husband goes back to the
[53:24] world you are not built upon your
[53:25] marriage you are built on Jesus
[53:28] you can't stop coming to church because
[53:30] your husband is no longer coming to
[53:31] church you shall not following your
[53:33] husband you are following Jesus sir
[53:37] you can't stop coming to church because
[53:38] you lost your job you don't worship your
[53:41] job you worship Jesus
[53:43] Hallelujah
[53:45] in the sun in the rain we worship Jesus
[53:48] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
[53:51] there is no one that drives for you
[53:52] except Jesus there is no one that saved
[53:55] you except Jesus
[53:57] not even your neighbor not even your
[53:59] children Jesus died for you
[54:02] you come to church for Jesus I lost my
[54:05] brother like my sister but I can't what
[54:07] Jesus show me Jesus
[54:10] Hallelujah the grace unto Jesus and says
[54:14] yes we would see Jesus
[54:17] Hallelujah

[54:22] if Jesus I really want to see you
[54:26] oh I want to see him look upon his face
[54:29] sir there to sing forever
[54:31] Hallelujah
[54:33] praise be to God

[54:37] or you are looking at circumstances
[54:39] around you look to Jesus look and leave
[54:43] my brother look and leave
[54:44] praise God
[54:46] there's an old song that we're used to
[54:48] sing
[54:48] he says lift him up lift him up
[54:53] lift him up for the world to see amen
[54:56] don't exalt the preacher don't accept
[54:58] the put the Pew leave Jesus Christ the
[55:01] Savior for everyone to see
[55:03] that's what we want that that's that
[55:06] testimony the Bible says that testimony
[55:08] that there's testimony of Jesus Christ
[55:10] is the spirit of Prophecy
[55:13] that's why Elijah when he came in our
[55:15] day the thought that they found in him
[55:18] they said you break too much on Jesus
[55:21] they said you break too much on Jesus
[55:25] every prophet testified of Jesus Christ
[55:28] and if we are a true church tonight we
[55:31] have to show Jesus because we are
[55:34] married to Jesus Christ when we say we
[55:36] are the bride we are the bride of Christ
[55:38] and Christ is the word of God
[55:41] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail like
[55:44] it is this church
[55:45] they can Prevail against the
[55:47] denomination but they shall not Prevail
[55:50] against the individual that is Faith a
[55:53] revelation of Christ
[55:55] praise God
[55:57] now this Revelation does not come from
[56:00] flesh and blood it's not the bishop of
[56:03] the president that can explain it to
[56:04] Israel it has to be revealed to you
[56:07] to to your to your heart by Jesus Christ
[56:10] himself
[56:11] praise God Luke chapter 21 verse 25 the
[56:15] Bible says they should be signs in the
[56:17] Sun and in the moon and in the Stars

[56:46] Bible that's what Jesus Christ said
[56:50] in the seas and the way of the Roaring
[56:52] men's Hearts failing them for fear and
[56:55] you know what
[56:56] when this scripture was written
[56:59] people thought how is this possible but
[57:02] now today you read the medical journals
[57:04] they say that one of the biggest problem
[57:07] is anxiety
[57:08] and what is anxiety is the fear
[57:11] fear of things that that can come the
[57:15] fear of losing your job the fear of not
[57:17] finding the right partner in marriage
[57:19] the fear of just there is a lot of
[57:22] depression and anxiety in the world
[57:25] the Bible says men's Hearts failing them
[57:28] for fear and for looking after those
[57:30] things which are coming upon the Earth
[57:32] for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken
[57:36] covet shaking the Earth

[57:57] I ever be able to to to to finish my
[57:59] mortgage what if my house my house is
[58:02] taken men's Hearts failing them for fear
[58:06] but let me tell you something Jesus
[58:08] Christ is the cemetery today and forever
[58:10] those that trust in him shall find
[58:13] refuge in him
[58:14] the name of the Lord is a mighty tower
[58:16] and the righteous run into it and they
[58:19] are safe
[58:21] amen
[58:23] Luke chapter 22 31 Jesus Christ said and
[58:27] the Lord said Simon Simon
[58:29] behold Satan his desire to have you that
[58:34] he may sift you as wheat
[58:36] but I have prayed for you
[58:38] now notice here he did not pray that
[58:41] Satan doesn't come no I have prayed for
[58:45] thee that Satan should not touch you no
[58:48] I prayed for you that you uh you rebuke
[58:52] the devil and he's destroyed no I have
[58:55] prayed for thee that thy faith failed
[58:58] not
[58:59] and when thou art converted strengthened
[59:03] thy brethren
[59:04] offenses will come the enemy will come
[59:07] the devil will come to sift you like
[59:09] wheat but I'm glad that though he was
[59:12] sifted but he was with
[59:14] if you are a chaff if you are sifted
[59:17] whether you are look no I I don't care
[59:20] how the devil will sift me that will
[59:22] never change my nature if I am with I am
[59:24] with
[59:25] in Jesus Christ said I've prayed for
[59:27] thee that your faith fell not so which
[59:31] means that there is a possibility that
[59:32] it cannot fail but guess what the elect
[59:35] cannot be deceived
[59:37] praise be to God
[59:39] is that what the Bible says Matthew 11
[59:42] verse 6 the Bible says and blessed is he
[59:45] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[59:47] and as they departed Jesus began to say
[59:50] unto the multitude concerning John
[59:53] what went he out into the Wilderness to
[59:56] see a reed shaken with the Wind
[59:59] but what went out to see a man clothed
[1:00:02] in soft Remnant behold they that wear
[1:00:04] soft clothing are in King's houses but
[1:00:07] but what went he out to see a prophet
[1:00:09] here I say unto you and more than a
[1:00:12] prophet so Jesus Christ is saying John
[1:00:14] was not a man who was shaken by the wind
[1:00:18] like a reed
[1:00:19] he was a prophet and more than a prophet
[1:00:21] and I want to say to you tonight
[1:00:24] let let know the devil Shake You by
[1:00:27] every wind of Doctrine let not the enemy
[1:00:30] Shake You by every wind of Temptation
[1:00:32] let not the enemy Shake You by every
[1:00:34] wind of doubt
[1:00:36] stand in the Lord
[1:00:39] stand up stand up for Jesus
[1:00:42] stand In Christ Alone he is I'm aware
[1:00:45] stand and stand until you we see him
[1:00:47] coming in glory praise be to God
[1:00:50] we have so many weak Christians today
[1:00:53] because they are not properly born by
[1:00:56] the Holy Spirit and by the word of God
[1:00:59] that's why when you know it's like uh
[1:01:01] Broiler chickens I don't know what you
[1:01:03] call them here
[1:01:04] you know there's a free-range chicken
[1:01:07] or a pasta raised raised chicken if you
[1:01:11] try to catch it it's not easy you know
[1:01:13] it's always running you know it can
[1:01:15] survive but a broiler chicken
[1:01:17] it's hatched by a hand of man
[1:01:20] you have to feed it you have to put the
[1:01:22] light you have to make sure there's the
[1:01:24] best atmosphere you have to control the
[1:01:26] temperature because if it gets a little
[1:01:28] bit cold they can die if it gets a
[1:01:31] little bit warm they can die
[1:01:33] you can kill hundreds dozens and the
[1:01:35] others will be looking they can't run
[1:01:37] away because they are weak they are born
[1:01:39] by the artificial hand of men but a
[1:01:42] pasture-raised chicken
[1:01:44] what is she he sends his danger brother
[1:01:48] you can you can catch him he will run
[1:01:51] because there's something in this life
[1:01:54] in him
[1:01:55] if you are born by the word of God not
[1:01:58] born by a denomination not born by man's
[1:02:01] ideas you can stand and stand in Christ
[1:02:05] despite the situations that may come
[1:02:09] praise be to God
[1:02:11] are you here tonight
[1:02:12] are you here tonight they say brother
[1:02:15] Aaron I've been shaken too many times I
[1:02:17] want to stand for Jesus Christ I want to
[1:02:20] take a stand for Jesus Christ
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:24] Ephesians 4 14 the Bible says and we
[1:02:27] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:02:30] and from and carried about with every
[1:02:32] wind of Doctrine everything that comes
[1:02:37] you know takes people away you know
[1:02:40] every little thing you know false
[1:02:42] Doctrine if you read galaxian the Bible
[1:02:44] says and the works of the flesh are
[1:02:45] these and they list them last and these
[1:02:47] days and it says and and heresies so
[1:02:50] heresies and false doctrines they are
[1:02:53] also a work of the enemy how many knows
[1:02:55] that but here Paul is saying it in
[1:02:58] Ephesians you know I love the book of
[1:02:59] Ephesians because it's a balanced book
[1:03:02] the book of Ephesians if you read
[1:03:04] chapter one it talks about you know be
[1:03:06] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh
[1:03:09] this great Mysteries and you come to the
[1:03:11] last chapter it goes to the basics
[1:03:13] husbands love your wives
[1:03:15] wives honor your husbands children obey
[1:03:18] your parents so the book of Ephesians is
[1:03:20] one of my favorite books so here is
[1:03:22] saying that that will be no more
[1:03:24] children
[1:03:25] you know one thing about children is
[1:03:28] that
[1:03:28] they are immature and because they are
[1:03:31] immature they are slaves to their
[1:03:33] emotions
[1:03:35] if a child wants something they will cry
[1:03:38] for it
[1:03:39] they are slaves of their feelings
[1:03:44] you can't say no to a child
[1:03:46] because they are immature in their
[1:03:49] children
[1:03:51] they are they are bound by their flesh
[1:03:55] they are bound by their desires because
[1:03:58] they are children
[1:04:00] if they want fries or McDonald's she
[1:04:04] will cry and kick and you know do
[1:04:07] everything
[1:04:08] I want McDonald's says no no no honey
[1:04:12] we're gonna We're not gonna have
[1:04:12] McDonald's today if if that's what if if
[1:04:15] she wants a toy she will do everything
[1:04:18] that's a baby
[1:04:20] and poisons be no more children
[1:04:23] tossed back and forth carried with every
[1:04:26] wind of Doctrine you know a child has no
[1:04:30] restraint
[1:04:31] if something if you drop a spoon she
[1:04:34] wants a spoon if she says something she
[1:04:36] wants that she says this she wants this
[1:04:38] she is just you know up and down because
[1:04:41] she is a child
[1:04:43] but when we come to maturity in Jesus
[1:04:47] Christ
[1:04:48] we are able to say no to ourselves we
[1:04:52] are able to say not to our bodies we are
[1:04:54] able to say not to essential desires
[1:04:58] we don't just give in to our desires
[1:05:01] oh brother I'm a man of Flesh what am I
[1:05:04] supposed to do you are a son of God
[1:05:07] oh brother what you expect me to do it
[1:05:09] was too much upon me
[1:05:12] no
[1:05:13] you are supposed to be a mature Son of
[1:05:16] God
[1:05:17] like Joseph
[1:05:18] he had been away from home he was not
[1:05:22] married he was like any other young man
[1:05:24] he had all the passions that come with a
[1:05:28] normal human being
[1:05:30] yeah he could have said oh what am I
[1:05:32] supposed to do you know the woman
[1:05:33] praised me I couldn't do anything
[1:05:36] if it means you have to kick the door
[1:05:39] you have to do it
[1:05:41] that's maturity
[1:05:43] but today we don't have that
[1:05:45] today I'm not coming to church I've got
[1:05:47] a little headache I'm not coming to
[1:05:49] church my dog is sick I'm not coming to
[1:05:52] church
[1:05:53] it used to be back in the day when
[1:05:54] someone is sick they say I'm going to
[1:05:56] church I want to be prayed for
[1:05:58] it used to be that when people had
[1:06:00] problems they would come to church but
[1:06:02] now when someone is sick they stay away
[1:06:05] from church
[1:06:06] because they find their healing
[1:06:09] somewhere it used to be that when
[1:06:11] someone has a problem or a weakness they
[1:06:13] come to church they say this problem I'm
[1:06:16] going to Jesus this addiction I'm going
[1:06:20] to crush
[1:06:21] but today people will be like I'm gonna
[1:06:24] come to church after I quit my smoking
[1:06:26] how can you do it how are you going to
[1:06:28] do it without the power
[1:06:31] imagine if you are sick and you say you
[1:06:33] know what I'm gonna get healed and then
[1:06:34] I'm gonna book my appointment with the
[1:06:36] doctor
[1:06:37] does it make sense
[1:06:40] imagine you're in you're in an accident
[1:06:42] and you say you know what I'm gonna come
[1:06:43] out of this and then I'll call 9-1-1
[1:06:45] as soon as you are in trouble
[1:06:48] Siri call 9-1-1
[1:06:51] praise God
[1:06:53] in the days of the prophets when he was
[1:06:55] preaching there will be Wheelchairs and
[1:06:58] the clashes here on the on the altar
[1:07:00] because people trusted in Christ they
[1:07:03] said if I'm going to die I'm going to
[1:07:05] die in church
[1:07:06] but today just just a little
[1:07:11] just just a little I don't know how to
[1:07:14] describe just like my little finger
[1:07:16] hurts I'm not going to church
[1:07:18] just the slightest excuse they won't
[1:07:22] come to church
[1:07:23] why is the love of many has washed cold
[1:07:26] the love of many has waxed code
[1:07:29] but praise God you have managed to come
[1:07:31] to church and God will give you the
[1:07:33] blessing of coming to church
[1:07:35] praise be to God
[1:07:38] I don't believe in a
[1:07:41] I don't believe that apps will solve all
[1:07:43] of our problems
[1:07:44] you know people become so reliant on the
[1:07:46] internet they want an internet religion
[1:07:49] they want their food from the internet
[1:07:52] advice from the internet until they are
[1:07:55] obsessed with the internet but guess
[1:07:57] what the internet is not going to solve
[1:07:59] everything
[1:08:00] Jesus Christ is still the answer to all
[1:08:03] our problems
[1:08:06] First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 38.
[1:08:10] I'm winding down all these Men of War
[1:08:12] that could keep their rank
[1:08:16] these are the men the Mighty Men of
[1:08:18] David that are being described here the
[1:08:20] Bible saying that they could keep their
[1:08:23] rank
[1:08:24] they they were not people who were just
[1:08:26] you know flip-flopping there are a lot
[1:08:28] of people who were just you know like
[1:08:30] politicians today they are saying these
[1:08:32] tomorrow they are saying that no
[1:08:34] these were warriors that could keep
[1:08:36] their rank
[1:08:38] if he's a deacon he's going to be a
[1:08:40] deacon if he's an usher is going to be
[1:08:42] an usher if he's a minister he's going
[1:08:44] to be a minister if he's a Believer he's
[1:08:46] going to be a believer
[1:08:48] today is a not today you are a Christian
[1:08:51] tomorrow you are in the pub and then the
[1:08:53] next day you are these and then the next
[1:08:55] day you are that the Bible says that
[1:08:57] they could keep their rank
[1:09:00] they came with the perfect heart to
[1:09:03] Hebron to make David the king and you
[1:09:06] know what we are doing tonight we want
[1:09:07] to make Jesus Christ the King we are not
[1:09:10] we are not interested in making Joe
[1:09:12] Biden the king we're not interested in
[1:09:14] making Donald Trump the king we are
[1:09:16] interested in making Jesus the king of
[1:09:18] the Earth
[1:09:20] Hallelujah
[1:09:22] there is nobody there is no party that
[1:09:24] shall solve The World's problems
[1:09:27] you go to Africa they are complaining oh
[1:09:30] they did this to us you go to Jamaica
[1:09:31] they're complaining I come to America I
[1:09:33] thought that everything everyone is
[1:09:34] complaining you know what only Jesus
[1:09:37] Christ is going to solve all the
[1:09:38] problems
[1:09:40] praise God
[1:09:42] I saw folks yesterday they were
[1:09:44] disappointed yeah
[1:09:45] on the client of mine they are holding
[1:09:47] their phones and they were disappointed
[1:09:49] they were like ah and I was hoping that
[1:09:51] things would go this way nothing would
[1:09:53] change until Jesus Christ comes
[1:09:56] let's read uh in Jude chapter 1 verse 6.
[1:10:00] I like what the Amplified version says
[1:10:03] here it says and the angels who did not
[1:10:06] keep their rank who did not keep their
[1:10:09] own designated place of power
[1:10:13] but abandon their proper Dwelling Place
[1:10:17] he has kept in Eternal chains
[1:10:21] the thick Gloom of utter Darkness for
[1:10:23] the Judgment of the great day
[1:10:26] these angels they are fallen angels
[1:10:30] they did not
[1:10:32] keep their rank like today men don't
[1:10:34] want to be man they want to be women
[1:10:37] leaving their ring their place of power
[1:10:41] when God made the man to be a father of
[1:10:44] the house when God made a woman to be a
[1:10:46] mother of the house and raise children
[1:10:48] that's your place of power but they've
[1:10:52] left their rank they want to be men also
[1:10:55] I I identify as these and these I
[1:10:58] identified and start in that living
[1:11:00] their rank
[1:11:02] but I'm glad tonight that we have sons
[1:11:04] of God who will keep their rank we have
[1:11:06] got Daughters of God who keep their
[1:11:08] place
[1:11:09] praise God so the men of David they kept
[1:11:12] their Rank and these Fallen Angels they
[1:11:16] lose their destinated place of power and
[1:11:18] I want to tell you something your
[1:11:20] position is your superpower
[1:11:22] if you take a fish from the water you
[1:11:26] have taken it from its place of power
[1:11:29] should make it powerless and if you take
[1:11:32] a Believer from the word you make him
[1:11:34] powerless remember when the enemy came
[1:11:36] to if and Adam only he had to do was to
[1:11:40] take them from the word
[1:11:42] once he took them from the word then
[1:11:45] they were finished
[1:11:46] they were no longer equal with God they
[1:11:49] were omnipotent because they had left
[1:11:52] their place of power but tonight I want
[1:11:55] you to say I shall not be moved from the
[1:11:57] word of God I shall not be moved from my
[1:11:59] rank I shall not be moved from my place
[1:12:02] of power
[1:12:04] Hallelujah
[1:12:08] I'm gonna suffer but I'm gonna be a Son
[1:12:10] of God if I have to lose my job I will
[1:12:13] lose it but I'll keep my word the word
[1:12:15] of God
[1:12:16] I remember one time I got a job I was
[1:12:18] desperate in Africa and the man says hey
[1:12:20] look you're you're a CPA we like we
[1:12:23] laugh you know what you do I want you to
[1:12:25] you know do this work but you know part
[1:12:27] of we have we have another company that
[1:12:29] deals in liquor so we want you to be
[1:12:32] able to go there visit look at the
[1:12:34] inventories I said you know what as long
[1:12:35] as once you say liquor I can't I can't I
[1:12:38] can't touch I can't handle that
[1:12:39] especially me myself I'm a minister
[1:12:42] says but you know we'll pay you good
[1:12:43] money so that I said you know what I'm
[1:12:44] going to lose the money I want to keep
[1:12:47] my place of power
[1:12:49] if I if I have to suffer I'll just
[1:12:51] suffer belief in the word of God I'm not
[1:12:53] gonna be working in a bar or just doing
[1:12:56] all kinds of things if I want a job it
[1:12:59] has to come from the Lord
[1:13:01] remember Cain
[1:13:02] Eve went to the Bible says in against
[1:13:05] that Eve said I have gotten a man from
[1:13:07] the Lord but that was came and guess
[1:13:09] what Cain gave them troubles remember
[1:13:12] Abraham when he couldn't wait upon the
[1:13:14] promise and he had Ishmael
[1:13:16] that was a testimony but it gave them
[1:13:20] problems
[1:13:21] and right now what's giving Israel
[1:13:24] problems is the ishmaelites
[1:13:26] praise God so you can have something
[1:13:28] that is outside of the word of God and
[1:13:31] it can look like a testimony but it's
[1:13:33] gonna give you problems
[1:13:35] you say you know what I'm not going to
[1:13:36] wait for a sister from church or her
[1:13:38] brother from church I'm just gonna pick
[1:13:39] from the world yeah you can have a
[1:13:41] wedding and give a testimony but you're
[1:13:43] gonna have problems
[1:13:46] praise God
[1:13:48] because the Bible says that don't be an
[1:13:50] equally yoked with unbelievers Proverbs
[1:13:53] chapter 22 first credit is this too is
[1:13:55] this too hard
[1:13:56] I should have not said that
[1:13:59] Proverbs 22 verse 28 we have to say
[1:14:01] these things to our young people
[1:14:03] they have to know that we're not playing
[1:14:05] games here we are standing for the
[1:14:06] message of the hour
[1:14:08] Proverbs 22 verse 28. do not remove the
[1:14:12] ancient landmark
[1:14:14] a boundary of property which your
[1:14:16] fathers have set
[1:14:18] that's why Elijah when he comes Malachi
[1:14:20] chapter 4 he would tend the heart of the
[1:14:22] children back to the fathers he is not
[1:14:25] coming to introduce a new doctrine he
[1:14:28] says I preach what Paul preached he is
[1:14:31] coming to restore us back to the
[1:14:33] boundaries that were given to the
[1:14:35] forefathers
[1:14:36] Hallelujah
[1:14:38] we were not going God is not going to
[1:14:40] compromise and say ah these people you
[1:14:42] know they lived in 2022 what were they
[1:14:44] supposed to do God says don't remove the
[1:14:47] ancient landmarks
[1:14:49] that your fathers have said
[1:14:51] the landmarks was set by Paul
[1:14:54] it was said by Peter and the disciples
[1:14:56] and the Bible says we are built upon the
[1:14:58] foundation of the prophets and the
[1:15:01] apostles
[1:15:02] Luke chapter 9 verse 16
[1:15:04] 62 Jesus said unto him no man having put
[1:15:08] his hand onto the plow and looking back
[1:15:11] his feet for the kingdom of God in other
[1:15:13] words if you begin with Jesus you have
[1:15:15] to keep continuing with Jesus if you
[1:15:18] stand with Jesus stand In Christ Alone
[1:15:21] Matthew chapter 24 verse this is the
[1:15:24] second from last maybe I think I've got
[1:15:27] two more slides and then you know we are
[1:15:29] done Matthew 24 verse 12 and because
[1:15:31] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:15:34] shall Works code but he that shall
[1:15:36] endure to the end the same shall be
[1:15:39] saved
[1:15:40] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 16
[1:15:42] for which cause we faint not
[1:15:46] but thought out what we perish yet in
[1:15:50] what men is renewed day by day though
[1:15:53] outside we perish though we might lose
[1:15:55] some some opportunities though we might
[1:15:57] lose some some some some some some
[1:15:59] friends so outside we perish but inside
[1:16:03] we have we are being changed to be like
[1:16:05] Jesus
[1:16:07] must Jesus bear heal the cross alone
[1:16:10] there is a cross for me there's a cross
[1:16:12] for you
[1:16:13] Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31 my last
[1:16:16] scripture but they that wait upon the
[1:16:20] Lord
[1:16:21] how he knew their strength they shall
[1:16:24] Mount up with wings as the egos are they
[1:16:27] shall run and not be weary and they
[1:16:30] shall walk and not fade
[1:16:31] teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait
[1:16:34] Darkness shall cover the Earth in Gross
[1:16:36] Darkness shall cover the people but they
[1:16:39] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:16:42] their strength let's sin upon our feet
[1:16:47] don't be moved tonight
