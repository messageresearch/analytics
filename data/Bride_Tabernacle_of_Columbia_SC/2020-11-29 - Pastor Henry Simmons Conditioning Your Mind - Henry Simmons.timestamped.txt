[33:49] in your hand may you say the things you
[33:51] want said and do the things you want
[33:53] done in Jesus name we pray amen
[34:00] the book of 2 Thessalonians
[34:07] 2 we believe
[34:10] that in this age the mind is being
[34:17] conditioned the prophet of God talks
[34:19] about we must get in the
[34:23] spirit of Sodom before the world could
[34:26] really
[34:28] burn okay we having a little problem
[34:33] must get in the spirit of it and I'm
[34:36] saying condition in the
[34:39] mind and when we condition our
[34:43] minds often times we talk about
[34:46] condition our bodies if you're going to
[34:48] run a marathon or if you're going to
[34:51] play a sports you got to get in
[34:54] condition because you want to be able to
[34:57] finish
[34:58] your
[34:59] Endeavor okay so as we think about the
[35:03] physical condition how about the mental
[35:08] condition
[35:10] here 2 Thessalonians
[35:14] 2 now
[35:16] we besee you
[35:20] Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[35:24] Christ and by our gathering together
[35:28] unto
[35:29] him that ye be
[35:31] not soon shaken in mind watch
[35:37] it the coming of the Lord but he said
[35:39] don't be soon shaken in
[35:42] mine because your mind can start
[35:46] shaking are you with
[35:48] me don't let the conditions shake you
[35:55] up or be trouble
[36:02] or be
[36:04] trouble neither by
[36:06] Spirit nor by
[36:09] word nor by letter as from
[36:14] us as that day of Christ is at
[36:19] hand that was over 2,000 years ago but I
[36:23] believe is it it is at hand
[36:28] let no man deceive you by what by any
[36:32] means for that day shall not come except
[36:38] what are you witnessing that
[36:42] sir that come of Falling Away
[36:47] first might be more people going to
[36:50] church but they're falling
[36:51] away from
[36:53] what the truth
[36:58] [Music]
[37:00] amen Falling Away first
[37:03] [Music]
[37:05] amen and that man of sin be revealed the
[37:10] son of
[37:12] predition we have the man of sin the son
[37:15] of preditions will we find many are
[37:18] going to follow their pricious
[37:22] ways many are going to be
[37:24] trapped in the snare of the devil
[37:29] who opposes and exalt himself above all
[37:32] that is called God all that is worshiped
[37:36] so that
[37:37] he as God set in the temple of God
[37:40] showing himself that he is what he's
[37:47] God you may be seated God bless to
[37:49] reading his
[37:51] word the devil going to set in the
[37:53] temple of God remember your body is what
[37:57] the Temple of the Holy Ghost the devil
[37:59] was set in the temple of God and he
[38:04] would say that he is
[38:09] God just in the mindset of many
[38:13] folk many folks in their mind think that
[38:16] they could be
[38:18] devilish
[38:19] Central
[38:22] sinful and actually are so
[38:26] deceived that they still think that
[38:28] they're
[38:31] Christians they can commit adultery
[38:34] fornicate they can you know men with men
[38:37] women with women all kind of sins and
[38:40] they still think I'm a
[38:43] Christian why because something is in
[38:46] the temple of God showing themselves
[38:49] that he is God and he wants to be
[38:54] worshiped are you with me so it's a
[38:57] spirit Spirit that's on the throne of
[38:59] their soul that actually wants
[39:04] worship so instead of worshiping the
[39:07] true and living God they are so
[39:10] deceived that they come to church
[39:12] thinking that they worshiping
[39:14] Jesus and that they're worshiping God
[39:18] but because they did not learn the love
[39:20] of the
[39:23] truth God shall give them strong
[39:26] delusion
[39:29] are you with me so we're in the
[39:32] condition of the mind I'm the devil is
[39:36] setting the whole world
[39:41] up the world is being set up and brother
[39:45] and
[39:46] sister if God does not give you
[39:50] wisdom he said here's the mind that has
[39:53] wisdom let him that has the
[39:55] understanding
[40:00] so that that day should not catch you as
[40:03] a thief are you with
[40:06] me the world is being set
[40:10] up the world is being
[40:13] conditioned what are they getting in
[40:16] condition
[40:19] for this
[40:22] these spirits of
[40:25] deception the Antichrist spirit that was
[40:28] working in the first
[40:32] age was setting itself up for the
[40:37] Antichrist
[40:40] himself are you with
[40:42] me so the
[40:48] Antichrist sent spirits that went forth
[40:51] before him to get the world in condition
[40:56] for that man of
[40:59] sin are you with me so the spirits go
[41:03] out to condition their minds and get the
[41:06] people ready
[41:09] for to
[41:12] receive the man of
[41:15] sin so
[41:20] people the prophet of God talks about
[41:23] thirst and he talks about what we're
[41:26] thirsting
[41:28] as David said my soul thirst is for the
[41:31] Living
[41:33] God he was thirsting for God my soul
[41:37] thirth for the Living
[41:40] God he said as the heart painted after
[41:43] the water
[41:45] book
[41:47] amen so my soul thirsteth for the Living
[41:53] God
[41:55] now David realized
[41:59] that as the
[42:01] body the Natural Body needed
[42:07] water and there was a thirst that was in
[42:10] his
[42:12] jar in the natural for
[42:16] water you don't drink any
[42:19] water and for a period of time then you
[42:23] realize that if the body does not get
[42:26] water
[42:28] then you begin to thirst you begin to
[42:31] desire thirst for it and then that voice
[42:34] is like an alarm that thirst is like an
[42:37] alarm it get louder and
[42:42] louder but if you refuse to give the
[42:44] body water what happens brother

[43:34] die you get so hungry you can get cramps
[43:38] in your stomach
[43:40] you started gring want some
[43:44] food ain't that right but if you don't
[43:48] eat
[43:50] something as the natural body cannot
[43:54] survive without
[43:58] food the natur few
[44:02] food Jesus said man shall not live by
[44:05] bread

[54:03] this
[54:03] [Music]
[54:08] hour all kind of things are
[54:11] [Music]
[54:15] happening the fifth verse says remember
[54:18] ye
[54:19] not when I was yet with you I told you
[54:23] these
[54:23] things and now you know
[54:27] what withholdeth that he might be
[54:31] revealed in his
[54:33] time for the
[54:37] mystery of
[54:40] iniquity iniquity
[54:44] is when you know
[54:47] better and you don't know no and you
[54:49] don't do no
[54:51] better you know how you supposed to live
[54:56] you know how you supposed to
[55:00] walk the mystery of iniquity that a
[55:04] demon
[55:10] Spirit that's hiding in the
[55:13] inside and you got to want that devil
[55:16] out
[55:18] to if your desires is not for the things
[55:21] of
[55:22] God then there a Wicked spirit
[55:29] what
[55:31] makes a
[55:35] man want
[55:37] to commit adultery
[55:41] fornicating look at pornography that's a
[55:44] wicked
[55:47] demon what makes a young lady wants to
[55:51] show all of herself
[55:57] said I forgot my
[56:03] slip some say I want to show off
[56:08] my upper
[56:10] part what makes some want to do that
[56:13] what desires for them to be revealing
[56:17] and tempting men and amen knowing that
[56:20] the scripture said if a man look at a
[56:22] woman and lust after her she causes him
[56:25] to commit
[56:27] adultery what makes a woman want to make
[56:31] it has to be that woman that young girl
[56:35] that uh that uh mistress that uh maybe
[56:39] that ageable woman she has no desire to
[56:42] make a man go to
[56:45] hell but it's only because the weak pull
[56:49] pits the weak preachers in the pull pit
[56:52] don't tell them no better
[56:56] are you with
[56:58] me because when you know to do good and
[57:01] you don't do it it's
[57:03] sin but if nobody tell you you
[57:07] can and that's why it makes me so hump
[57:11] to feel for those people that amen they
[57:14] don't know and should I beat them over
[57:17] the head because the B Jesus said
[57:20] forgive them because
[57:22] what but you that know the truth
[57:27] should God forgive you because you don't
[57:29] know no
[57:31] better you know the better and you still
[57:35] do the same thing that they are
[57:38] doing they would do better if they knew
[57:41] better you know better it won't do no
[57:46] better are you with me there is a
[57:49] difference is't that right now God can
[57:53] say Mercy on them
[57:57] but should God said mercy on
[58:03] you I can see them coming before God and
[58:07] and they might have had on
[58:11] a
[58:13] whatever topless
[58:16] top but they didn't know no
[58:19] better but you Amen to hear the word and
[58:23] say you love Jesus and say you're a
[58:25] Christian
[58:28] ought to know
[58:30] better are you with me that will be no
[58:34] excuse for
[58:36] you in that day when Jesus
[58:42] returned there would be no
[58:46] excuse so brother and sister you're
[58:48] going to have to give account to God for
[58:51] your own
[58:52] self it's not what brother sister so and
[58:55] so was doing is what you
[59:04] did
[59:06] brother are you trying to stay in style
[59:09] with your tight
[59:11] Bridges pants excuse
[59:16] me where men can lust out to men lust
[59:21] after men
[59:26] and give some slack you might look
[59:29] oldfashioned but you in style with
[59:33] God are you with me I don't want to be
[59:36] in style with the world and go to hell
[59:38] for
[59:39] it amen the condition of the Mind the
[59:43] devil is taking everything that he can
[59:46] do the condition of mind that you can
[59:49] accept the
[59:51] what except the Antichrist
[59:56] except the mark of the
[59:59] beast are you with me he is actually
[1:00:03] getting you so hyped
[1:00:06] up that you don't even realize or know
[1:00:11] what Spirit has taking control of
[1:00:19] you sometimes the question is asked did
[1:00:21] you pray about
[1:00:23] it did you pray on that
[1:00:31] uh
[1:00:33] ah we don't want to pray and ask God is
[1:00:36] it all right the reason why we don't
[1:00:38] want to pray and ask God is it all right
[1:00:40] because we already know not to ask God
[1:00:42] nothing like that because we know it
[1:00:44] ain't
[1:00:46] right are you with me so why pray and
[1:00:50] ask God is it all right when you already
[1:00:53] know what God going to say
