His wounds have paid my ransom. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. I want to uh give special thanks to brother Simmons to invite me to these meetings. I came to know brother Simmons through uh brother David and sister Hana, the one who was testifying yesterday. Amen. And one day I I was in their house. I went there and you know they've kept their house with such an atmosphere. You know you enter a house um they they play that music which we play in meditation time just an atmosphere in the house. I enter the house, I said, "Wow, there are angels here." And then there was like they said a mist appeared just the moment I spoke that and God confirmed his presence in that home. I also met saw someone received the Holy Ghost right in the sitting room. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's where I met brother Simmons in and and he came there when I was there. So I thought surely for them to introduce me to him and if uh people he she says he's like my father figure if the daughter is like that what will be the daddy. Praise God. Amen. Oh I really appreciate uh what God is doing in their life and you know it was strange to come to us where you know there's too much sin then you find such people where God is vindicating himself. Amen. I was encouraged by the testimonies yesterday. And just to tell you a little bit more, there was a time I was with a brother in Africa. He's got a prophetic gift. I went to pick him up so that we go and pray for someone who had demons. &gt;&gt; And then this brother didn't tell me that he wasn't ready for the task. So we started out, we were going then I told him there's a sister in America who called and miss. I should have called her back. Then he says a voice dead told him tell him to call that sister right now. So we were just a few blocks from where we were going and I I I he told me can you call her normally I should have said no no no need let's first finish the job then we can talk to her but I decided to call her and the moment she responded you know it was in speaker and this brother just says wow this sister is anointed and he went in tongues. So I said I I was telling her, "Sorry, there's somebody in the car that's speaking in tongues right now." So she says, "I want to greet him." I said, "No, you can't. He's under anointing." &gt;&gt; So we reached and then they finally talked and then uh he he calmed down and he told the sister, he says, "I see you right now. You're driving and there's an angel in the car seated with you." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And and she confirmed. She says, "I knew that there was an angel because there was such a good atmosphere in the car and and how I knew there was an angel." And when Michael told him told her that, we finished. We went to this deliverance session and we prayed. The the sister had over 500 demons. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But we don't care how many demons the person has. I don't care how many demons are operating in your life. Praise God. Amen. And we prayed and those demons were defeated. And after that, Michael told me to say, "Do you know that uh I wasn't ready for that task." &gt;&gt; But when that sister said, "Hello, brother Jimmy." I managed to tap anointing from her to go and use for the deliverance. Hey, brother. If demons can travel on the phone or in the films, hey, if demons can travel on the movie, &gt;&gt; the power of God can travel on a phone. Praise God. And when I saw what God is doing in her life, when I came to their home, I heard those testimonies. I said, "Wow." So the God that I preach still exists. &gt;&gt; It encouraged me more. So I was telling her like there were more testimonies. I I think I'm not a long-winded preacher. I can give her 5 10 minutes. She gives us maybe two more testimonies or three more. Sister Hannah, please you may you may just so that when when when the foundation is lit, we're going to fly. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you again. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to be here. And this is all about Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, someone asked me yesterday, where did you come from? I said, you know, I came from the island of Trinidad. My daddy was a pioneer of this message. One who took this gospel around the world and introduced the message to thousands and thousands of people. That's in the 60s. &gt;&gt; And I received the Holy Ghost at the age of 11 years old. And since then, I've been serving the Lord with my whole heart. &gt;&gt; He's my everything, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I've seen a God in my daddy's life. No demon stood before him. And I said, "Lord, I just want to be like him. &gt;&gt; I want to be my like my heavenly father and my earthly father." &gt;&gt; And you really heard my prayer. &gt;&gt; And I bring you greetings from Trinidad. My family said, "Greet the church for me." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. There's so many testimonies, but I'll just be short, very long testimonies, but I'll just chop them up. I was driving my car. I had to go to the dealership one day and my husband um cleaned the battery poles and I had a limited time to reach to the dealership and I didn't know the time because the clock was you know messed up because there was no power and I was far a good way away from my house and I said Lord I don't have the time and the clock is not working and I forgot my watch on the dresser in my house. I said Lord where is the God of William Brham? I need my watch, Lord. And when I spoke the word, the watch that was in my dresser, far away from me appeared on my wrist. &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, God. You're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. I prove him in so many, many, many, many ways. This is all about Jesus." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Just a couple weeks ago, actually, there was a brother from Fort Lauderdale. He heard of all these testimonies and his son was very very sick. He would rip his clothes apart, go on the floor and just beat up himself and they had to buy the house down because it was a very very terrible demons that attacked him and there was no cure for him. Absolutely. They went to all the doctors they could have. Nothing could have cured that child. And the dad called, he said, "Can you pray for my son?" I said, "Yes, just bring him up." To make the long story short, he was in the back of the church and he stood like about there. He wouldn't come. And the daddy said, "Come." And he would not come. I said, "Brother, there's no distance in prayer. He doesn't even have to be here." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I just I just raised my hand. I said, "Father, just touch that child. &gt;&gt; Look how the devil has that poor innocent kid." &gt;&gt; And I just left that prayer like that. I said, "Brother, in two days time, your son is going to be okay." Church, I stand here as a testimony. He came to church a few weeks ago and now he's flying airplane totally healed. Got the highest grades in school. Got a scholarship and he's all alone flying airplane. What Jesus did for that child. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; We deserve all the praise and honor and glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember one day I was fasting at home and my husband was out of tongue. And I was in deep consecration before the Lord. That's my life. Just fast and pray. &gt;&gt; There's connect with Jesus. And I went to make a cup of tea. I was so weak. And I went to make a cup of tea and I said, "Oh, I have no milk." Because the cartoon was almost empty. And I I throw out a little drags of milk. And I said, "Father, I have no milk." And I'm so far away from the grocery store. And when I put the the container back, I heard the the milk just falling in the container. &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever." &gt;&gt; Then I heard a knock at my door. I heard a knock on my door. A loud knock. I said, "Who is that?" &gt;&gt; And I opened the door and I went outside and there was eight big stack of milk in front my door. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was the finest of the finest of the best of the milk. &gt;&gt; I tell you, eight stack of milk and I said, "Look, I said, "Hello. Hello. Is anybody here?" No one was there, but Jesus just rub all this milk there for me. I had so much milk and I had to share it around. That's my God. &gt;&gt; I love to talk about Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's my oxygen. I can't live without him. I give him all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. I've seen I just put my hand in the blind man eyes, and the Lord give them 2020 vision. &gt;&gt; 2020 vision. I see so many blind eyes open, the deaf ear, &gt;&gt; the walk. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember once in a Jimmy told me I could take a few minutes but I just be last. I was home and I was seeking the Lord and I got a call from a sister way in Trinidad and she said, "Sister Hannah, you remember me?" I said, "Yes, I do." She wanted a fridge and the the company wouldn't give her a fridge because she doesn't have a job and nobody wants to give her a fridge. And she said, "Can you pray for me?" I said, "Yes, you're going to get your fridge this week. You're going to get that fridge." They everybody denied her. And then she got a call. She said the company said, "I'm bringing the fridge for you without any money, no job, nothing." They brought the fridge to our house. She said, "The same God that gave me that fridge." She said, "Can you pray for my sister? She's dying in the hospital now. I'm millions of miles away from this sister." She said, "She's crippled. She has a stroke and she's twisted up. She can't walk. She can't talk. She can't do anything. I said, "Father, I'm sending the Holy Spirit in that hospital right now." I said, "Lord, I'm so far away, but there's no distance in prayer." &gt;&gt; I said, "Holy Spirit, go and arrest those demons &gt;&gt; in that hospital." &gt;&gt; I said, "Sister, in 2 hours time, your sister is going to be home." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now her blood pressure was out of control and her blood sugar was out of control. The doctor went this way in the hospital. Then he came back this way. He said, "Weren't you crippled? Weren't you crippled? Weren't your blood pressure so much?" And the sister was up and jumping up. He he discharged her 2 hours. Exactly 2 hours home she was home. Exactly 2 hours she went in a neighborhood. She took a weed eater and she started cutting the grass. Now all the neighbors know this woman is going to die. They say, "What happened to you?" She said, "Jesus healed me. That's the same God I serve. [Music] He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever." And another sister heard about it and she had a disease in her foot and I she said, "Can you pray for me?" I said, "Sure." And I kneel down. The anointing was so strong. She just stand here and I tell you nothing but the truth. I have all the evidence in my phone and I can give you every number to call. And while I was crying, she said the tears from my eyes fell on her feet and it healed it instantly. I said, "Lord, your spit open the blind eyes [Applause] and I think I can heal the sick. Nothing is too hard for God to do." &gt;&gt; I remember once I was in a neighborhood and I supposed to go to a sister's house and I said, "Lord, I was I called her. Her name is Sharma. I said, "Honey, I'm coming over to your house." And it was a little ways from where I was. And I don't know what happened, but the Lord took my vehicle from this point to that point without driving. Church. I didn't drive the car. And she said, "Mama, how did you get here?" I said, "He brought me here." I said, "He did it in the Bible days and he can do it again." Jesus just took me up. He took me up from one port and just took me and my vehicle to the other side. &gt;&gt; I never drove it. I said, "Lord, how great God." [Applause] I remember a little baby in Africa was dying and the pastor, she said, he said, "Can you go pray for my baby?" And it was near the baby was almost dead and I couldn't go because there was a big glass because of the intensive care. We're in the jungles of Africa. And I say, "Satan, you're such a wimp &gt;&gt; to attack a little child like that. That should show you have no power &gt;&gt; because this baby is innocent." I said, "But you got to go. That death angel got to go tonight." I said, "Lord, all I'm asking for that child to be home in the morning." Church, I stand here. She was dismissed that that night and was home in the next morning. Totally blood transfusion. Jesus did a blood transfusion and healed a child and her blood was normal as normal could be. way in the jungles. A brother came. He came to me in a long prayer line. God, you're not you. You have to know your God when you go where the witches are. &gt;&gt; And nobody would go there. The brother said, "No, no, no, no missionary comes. Only you alone came here. You and brother David." And while praying in the night, I heard such some noises. I said, "What's that?" I got up from the bed. There is grass roofs and stuff. A terrible place to be. Malaria everywhere. And I I heard the singing. They said, "Oh, the witches are out." I said, "Witches, you can't touch me. I know where I came from. I came from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And no devil in Africa can come against me because I know who I am. &gt;&gt; I'm walking in power. I'm walking with authority." &gt;&gt; Jesus, the whole of heaven is behind me. &gt;&gt; Every sick person was healed. Hundreds and hundreds of people. The whole village came out and the Lord touched them all. There was a brother, the witches attack his foot and it was rotting and I went on my knees and I just touched his leg. I said, "Lord, just touch him, father." The next day was totally healed. God created the skin. He created the bones. He created the flesh. That's my God. &gt;&gt; He deserve all the praise, &gt;&gt; all the honor and all the glory. I give him all the praise. I love him with all my heart. God bless you all. Thank you. Hallelujah. Come on, give him praise. Give him praise. Praise God. Amen. Let's stand. Give him praise. He's worthy of our praise. He's worthy. He's worthy. He's worthy. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus is here. The same Jesus is here. Oh, praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We give him praise. We give him glory. We give him honor. I can feel his presence right now. I have three scriptures to read, but let's just read one while we standing and we go shooting. Amen. John 8 verse uh 3 uh 6. The other verses I'll just refer to them as I preach. If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we've read the scripture. May you break the bread of life, Lord, to us. May you inspire these words, Lord, that we should experience your freedom. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Praise God. Our title is experiencing God's freedom. We are here to experience God's freedom. We are here to experience the power of God. Why do we have to experience God's freedom? Praise God. Amen. Uh uh Isaiah 59:1 says, "The hand of God is not short." &gt;&gt; Amen. That it cannot save and uh his ear not down that they cannot hear. Praise God. Amen. I don't want to read the next verse because the next verse is judgment. Uh I'm not bringing judgment. Uh the next verse I'm not going to read it. I'll end on verse one. It says the hand of God is not short that it cannot save. Praise God. Amen. It wasn't short then. It's not short now. Praise God. Amen. We must experience the freedom that Jesus gives. The hand of God is not short that it cannot save. And Hebrews uh 12 uh verse one says, hallelujah, after all this cloud of witnesses, after this cloud of witnesses, after we see that the God that we are serving is real, after we see that the God we are serving is able to change your situation, what are we going to do? The Bible says, "Let us uh lay aside the sin that so easily beset us and let us run this race that is set before us." That's why you need God's freedom because there's a race that you must run. There are victories to be won. God wants to save you. But he also wants to use the potentials that he has put in you because there's a work of God that must be done. Hallelujah. I was wondering when I was preparing this sermon. I was like, am I on side? Am I bringing things that are strange? After I finished preparing it, brother Yadel is my witness. I wanted to watch what was preached. Hallelujah. In the youth meeting, I discovered brother Matias was saying the things that I'm right I'm saying right now. He was saying the things that were in in in my notes. I was telling him I was jumping in the room. I said, "Therefore, what I'm going to preach is God giving me because God has confirmed it already." And I realized that brother Caleb, who was supposed to preach next, was also preaching the same verse. I said, "Wow." So therefore, what I've brought tonight is actually thus, says the Lord. And when we are standing on that, say the Lord, brother, we are bold and we are strong and we are so sure that what we are saying is going to work out. Therefore, I put every spirit under my control to the glory of God. Hallelujah. I don't care how long you have lived in sin. I don't care how long you've lived in sickness. Praise God. Amen. The Bible says, "These signs shall follow them that believe. In my name, they shall cast out devils." We are going to cast out devils tonight. We are here to cast out devils tonight. I'm here to cast out devils. Hallelujah. Yes. Come on. The devil is in trouble. He's got to be on the run. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You know the devil is like a lion &gt;&gt; roaming around roaring looking for someone that he can devour. &gt;&gt; And you know the way the lion hunts it wants to be in ambush so that you don't see it. You know what the devil wants to tell you? He wants to tell you that the drug addiction that you have, it is your nature. He wants to tell you the wrong sexual orientation that you have, it is your nature. just uh somehow you being a man, you are being attracted to a man instead of a woman. The devil wants to tell you it's your nature. He wants to hide. Hallelujah. It is demon power. When I came in the states the night I was about to preach the following day in the night, I had a dream. I was entering a certain place and there was some uh uh witchcraft that was happening, some altar of sexual immorality and pornography and it attacked me. And then the dream I started saying, "Fire, fire." And I jumped out and I woke up. I said, "I know what I'm dealing with in the United States. We are going to pull the strongholds down." Hallelujah. Oh say praise God our weapons of our warfare are not cannon men of God right now what we are doing we are doing a lot of damage in the kingdom of darkness the devil has held you for so long maybe in watching pornography hallelujah the devil has held you for so long maybe in sin maybe in drug addiction maybe in the religious form of nature we know that demons can operate physically we call them diseases Jesus. We know that demons can operate in the spirit. We say oppression, opposition. We also know that demons can operate in the religious realm where they want to tell you that the days of miracles are passed. Those are demons in the name of Jesus Christ. I declare you free tonight. I declare you free tonight. Receive your freedom. Receive your freedom. There is no reason why you should live in sin. no reason because the Bible in Isaiah 53 says he was wounded for our transgression. The chastisement of our peace laid upon his head and by his stripes we are healed. Therefore that scripture must be fulfilled so that we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled. Come on receive your freedom. Receive your freedom. Receive your deliverance. Hallelujah. Receive the power. Hallelujah. Receive it, my brother. Receive it, my sister. Jesus is here. He says, "Where two or three are gathered in my name, I'm in their midst." He does not come just to watch you. He does not come just to stand by. He comes because he knows that you have needs. Yes, your sin is great. Yes, your sin is great, but his grace is greater. His grace is greater than your sin. Hallelujah. The hand of God is not short that it can fail to reach you and reach you and reach you. Hallelujah. The long arm, the long arm of Jehovah is reaching you tonight. If you can only open your heart, there's no reason why you should live in sin because Jesus has paid the price. Hallelujah. You know it comes sometimes it comes like a thought. You think something wrong and you entertain it then you sin once then it becomes a stronghold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Until a brother or a sister is in a cycle. Tomorrow you repent but you go back in your old ways. I appreciate brother Matias for preaching that message in the morning. Hallelujah. But there's a time when God, hallelujah, will get a hold of you because the long arm of Jehovah is going to get a hold of you. Some of you have been running from serving God. Some of you, you know you have a gift and you don't want it to operate. Hallelujah. I walked, I moved with a brother. We went somewhere and he told me, I have a gift. I had a gift. I could see visions. But it's like I dreamt the devil come and he he did something and I can't see visions no more. I said, "Don't worry." And I was preaching like this, just like this. And I spoke, receive your deliverance. And his eyes opened. Today, he sees visions over and over, back to back. Hallelujah. The devil may have bound your gift. The devil may have tempered with your ministry. The devil may have tempered with your ability, but I'm here to tell you tonight, receive your deliverance. Hallelujah. Receive the fire. Receive your freedom. I open your gift. I open your gift. I open your gift. I open your gift. Receive the fire. Receive the power. Receive the power. God is here, my brother. Hallelujah. The devil is in trouble in the name of Jesus Christ. Every demon right now, get out in the name of Jesus. Out in the name of Jesus, you can be free. You can be free, my sister. You can be free, my brother. Hallelujah. All those addictions, today they are over. Today they are over. Why are you saying this, preacher man? Hallelujah, baby. The God with whom we have to do is the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. He cannot fail. &gt;&gt; He says, He says he's a rewarder of they that diligently seek him. You have come seeking the Lord. You think your effort is in vain. No, no, no, no. It's not in vain because my Jesus, hallelujah, is a rewarder of they that seek him diligently. Hallelujah. The Bible says in Hebrews it says &gt;&gt; for him to make sure the promise that he has given he swore by himself. &gt;&gt; Blessing I'll bless you. Hallelujah. He swore by himself. He could not swear by no greater. He looked at Michael Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, you are great. You are a great Formula 1 driver but you're too small. I can swear on you. He looked at Muhammad Ali. He says, "You're the greatest boxer, but I can swear on you. You are too small." Hallelujah. Praise God. He says, "Alexander the Great. You are surely a great man." But he weighed him in the balance. He says, "Your greatness is not great enough." Therefore, he swore by himself. Hallelujah. But not only swearing, the Bible says he who promised, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, can not lie. &gt;&gt; God can't lie. &gt;&gt; He can promise you something. And when you need salvation, he checks in his store and he finds salvation as finished. Then he runs away. Not my Jesus. God can't lie. You got to say that with me. God can't lie. Doesn't it sound good? &gt;&gt; We can increase the speed. God can't lie. Yes. God lie. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can't lie. God can't lie. God can't lie. God can't lie. God can't lie. God can't lie. Hallelujah. Give him a cup of praise. [Applause] He can't lie. Hallelujah. He can't fail and he won't start now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he healed then, he's going to heal now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God can't lie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He promised in Acts chapter 2, he says, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins." He did not say some sins but your sins. Whatever you may have done, Jesus is able to forgive you. Hallelujah. As long as you can humble yourself tonight and say, "Jesus, forgive me." He will forgive you. And when he forgives you, we are going to do one important thing. We'll baptize you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And then afterwards, you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. How do you not preach a man? The Bible says, "For the promise is unto you in Jerusalem and to all that are far off even in South Carolina." Hallelujah. To stem who the Lord our God shall call. Is he still calling? Yes. On the 30th, August 30th, 2025, the Lord is still calling and his promise can never fail. He says you can receive the Holy Ghost. You say, "Preacher man, I've been in the message. I've been a believer for so long. I've never received the Holy Ghost." Oh, you are in the right grounds. You are in the right place where the Holy Ghost is falling. You say, "Preacher man, how wow Peter yet spake the Holy Ghost fell." And I can safely tell you as I'm preaching right now, h the Holy Ghost is falling. Receive the Holy Ghost.

Says only if I can touch him." And she went and touched him. She went and touched him and she received a healing. And Jesus says, "Who touched me?" Hallelujah. He's saying the same tonight. Who touch me? And you are saying, "Here I am, Lord." The Bible says, "Your faith has made you whole." I'm telling you tonight, the same words that Jesus spoke, I'm speaking on his behalf right now.
