pastor simmons to go ahead with it even in the midst of this time that we're in amen it reminds me when uh we first got started bill simmons and we had that tent up over it i believe was in west columbia amen and and brussels had to mike and he was doing what he do and all of a sudden a lightning bolt struck and a fire came inside of the tent and brussels had that mic like that he bet he was holding it out when that when that thing struck and that that fire just went all through the tent i know the first thing come is that hey this is electricity but i believe it was the power of god come on how many believe that same jesus is alive right now come on how many believe he's the same yesterday today and forever oh come on worshipers come on somebody how many believe he's the same yesterday today and forever how many know our god is not dead but he's alive you know as i was praying this afternoon and i'm getting ready to get into a word for you but as i was praying lord what

thank god for the worship how many thank god for the worship come on somebody give god praise i thank god for the worship i thank god for the songs but how many know that um uh before the battle uh the levites would go forth insane amen they were setting the stage for the battle and how many know now the battle is on come on somebody come on somebody we're putting the devil on orders tonight

when we can recognize that he's here thank you jesus when we acknowledge that his presence is here and we recognize that he's still spirit amen and the spirit of the lord is here and when we can

don't look at the altar don't look at nothing look to jesus oh i mean to believe that our lord jesus can do exceeding abundantly more than we can actually think he told me to actually because he wanted to know what you needed and how many know he's a high priest that is touched with the feelings of your infirmities i mean you know the bible says you have not because you what axe not and how many know tonight we're gonna we're gonna keep on asking come on somebody how many are we gonna come before the throne tonight oh somebody say lord i'm coming before your throne tonight thought i'm coming before your throne tonight because you invited me you invited me lord to come before your throne to get help in the time of need oh hallelujah thank you jesus why because we are his children we are sheep of his pasture and his love is is so tremendous towards us and let me get into the word now because if i don't i'll keep you too long i'm brother lonnie jackson uh i'm pastor of a little fellowship aiken south carolina amen and i i didn't know that i was supposed to be preaching tonight but the the bishop of this church uh gave confidence that um uh i could um live what the scripture says it'd be instant in season and odyssey amen and i'm coming tonight i'm not coming i thank god for the fellowship of the brothers today and the minister's breakfast and i thank god for our brother from virginia and he made a statement he said people are always looking for something new and um and i and i thank god tonight that um what he said is what i believe we don't need something new how many know we need to hear the good old gospel come on how many know we need to um refresh ourselves to what's old oh somebody say man so i'm here to tell you tonight i'm not coming with anything new i i don't think we need anything new i mean no we need what god has already provided and what he's already provided is sufficient or somebody to give god praise tonight oh let the redeemer the lord give him praise tonight hallelujah i'm setting the expectations now the bible in the book of isaiah 59 if you have your bibles just read now you don't have to stand just yet because i got three places i want to leave read from but in isaiah the 59th chapter of isaiah the bible reads in verse 19. so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come unto zion and unto them that turn uh from transgression in jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them said the lord my spirit is upon thee and my words which i'll put in my mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth not the mouth of thy seed at the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from henceforth and forever let you say man and then in saint john the 12th chapter in verse 23 then i'm going to jump down to verse 27. and jesus answered them saying the hours come that the son of man should be everybody say glory of ours everybody said with me the hours come that the son of man should be glorified notice what verse 27 says now is my soul trouble and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came out unto this hour notice father glorified thy name notice what happened after the lord jesus cried that out then came a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again oh somebody shout hallelujah but i want you to notice something i want you to notice something when that voice from heaven spoke and that voice from heaven spoke about the glorification of the name the people that stood by and heard it said that it thundered thunder had rode and out of that thunder came the proclamation that the name was going to be glorified or somebody say glorify your name tonight lord and notice what the lord jesus added he said now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and that i if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me somebody say amen or somebody giving praise right now or somebody give him glory right now somebody say lord you are worthy of the glory you can be seated if you were standing let me introduce this lesson as as i um begin to lay a foundation for um the inspiration that's on us you know the bible says in second corinthians the third chapter and i don't intend to teach a long time tonight but i got to lay some scriptures in so that you can understand where i'm coming from it says but we all would open face beholdings as a glass the glory of the lord are changed into what the same image from what glory to glory even by what the spirit of how many believe that you're going to be changed come on how many say i'm waiting on my chance but how you changed were changed by beholding the glory of the lord we're changed by god opening up our eyes of understanding we're changed by god opening up uh our ears to hear we're changed by our hearts receiving something from the lord and when our eyes are open and when our ears open and our heart is open we behold the glory and when we behold the glory we are changed into the same image from glory to glory somebody wave your hands and say lord let that happen to me tonight oh somebody say lord let that happen to me tonight i desire we all desire to see the glory of the lord we all thirst for it and why because we're made in god's image and he placed inside of us a thirst inside of us and that thirst that he placed inside of us a prophet said that that thirst that he placed inside of us it us is to cause us to thirst for him it's to cause us to uh uh seek that secret place amen it causes us to search for that secret place where the glory is revealed i thank god for knowledge i i thank god for uh the the the understanding but i i want to see the glow i i desire to see the glow thank you jesus in this time a pandemic in this time of world turmoil in this time where people are dying and it's time where people are falling out when it's time of people leaving god the reason why they leaving god is because they haven't seen the glory [Music] the reason why there are questions in their mind the reason why doubts are ruling their lives it's because they haven't seen the glory you say well bro jackson i i have experienced the supernatural i've experienced uh elements of the supernatural churro i've seen the glory let me say something to you tonight the children israel they experienced the supernatural and they experienced the events in egypt when god used moses to bring plagues down on egypt they witnessed the plagues that the lord had his servants speak and bring it to existence and they were there that night when a deaf angel came to egypt they saw they experienced the cries of the egyptians they experienced the cries of every household of egypt amen and they also experienced the grace of god because god gave his servant something to do for his people amen to bring a distinction between them and the egyptians and the lord told moses to go out and get a lamb thank you jesus and slay that lamb and take the blood of that lamb and apply publicly and let people see the blood on the dope posts and the lentils let them see it display and when i see the blood the deaf angel can't come into your house i'm here to tell you today that jesus is the same today as he was back then thank you jesus the blood kept that death angel away and i'm here to tell you tonight the blood still keeps that death hangs your way glory to god i thank god tonight that them plagues was a sign that the exodus was on and the plagues of this day is a sign that the is on the lord said when you see these things come in the past look up lift up your heads because your redemption destroying now somebody somebody how many believe tonight that the day of redemption is near oh give him praise then now i want to hear you tonight hallelujah somebody saw hallelujah they they they experienced the water out of the rock they experienced the manna from on hell boneheads but how many of them crossed over into the promised land how many actually went on into the promise you don't have to answer it we know the answer it was two out of two men i mean i said lord help me to see the glory [Applause] come on wave your hands and say lord help me to see the glory i want to see your glory lord i i appreciate um every manifestation of the supernatural but i want to see the glory and i'll tell you tonight there is a secret place there's a secret place of thunder where there's victory from the forces of hell that's mounted on up on every side how many how many to believe that there is a secret place oh how many believe that god wants to reveal that secret to you tonight or somebody give my hand clapper praise come on now you gotta want it amen you gotta pull forward [Applause] now let's search it out just and and and i i thank the lord tonight i really do i believed in malaca 4 the purpose of malachi f4 was to restore the hearts of the worshippers how many believe that tonight restore the hearts to give us the faith that was once delivered to the first century saints in exodus the 33rd chapter you don't have to turn to it i'll read it in verse 12 it reads moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and has now let me know whom that will sin with me yet thou has said i know thee by name and has also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray that if i have found grace in thy sight show me thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in that sight and consider that this nation is thy people he said this is moses now and moses was the prophet that god revealed that pillow fire to on the top of that mountain and out of the fire came the voice of identification of who god is moses had experienced that he had experienced the commission to go down into egypt and bring god's people out and god with a mighty hand brought god's people out he experienced that he experienced all of that but here he is pleading with uh jehovah show me thy way i said that to say this and many people say that i i know that i i've heard that i i've i've read that but are you more than moses don't let that lay of the sin spirit get on you tonight do not let that spirit that said i'm i'm increased with goods and i don't need nothing get on you tonight buy that thing man thank you jesus and humble yourself and say lord show me that way somebody raised their hands and said lord show me that way if i have found grace and how many know tonight i believe i really believe in it i know y'all believe it that grace comes to us at the revelation of jesus christ so how many believe that we're living in the dispensation of grace come on how many believe that let me see your hands tonight i'm trying to get you i'm trying to get you involved in the word that i'm preaching tonight moses also knew that he also knew that but yet he felt the need to approach god and ask for additional inspiration he humbled himself an ex-guard for additional inspiration how many of the nights say lord i need something more i need more lord we being in this body of flesh still redemption on our soul but our flesh is still waiting for the change how many know we need more oh somebody said god give me more moses said lord if i found grace in your sight show me that way and notice what the lord said the lord said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest i got to go home but where and shall it be known here that i and that people have found grace in that sight is it not that thou goes with us so shall we be separated i am not people from all the people that upon the face of the earth and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name how many know the night that god knows our names well somebody wave your hands and say thank you lord for knowing my name and then thank him for his grace that he's already given us giving praise right now he's given us grace he knows us by name the bible said the foundation of the lord standing up to heaven the seal god knows those that are he is i thank god tonight that he know me but moses still needed something and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory now moses is still begging god show me your glory and he said i would make all my goodness pass before thee and i would proclaim notice the name of the lord before this somebody say man god knew what he needed and what he needed was another inspiration of the goodness of god he needed another dip of the name of god he needed another outpouring of god's grace to reveal his name to him oh somebody say amen oh god i'm getting i'm getting i'm getting these these vibes here i'm getting these vibes i i know the seals i know the church changes that i know all of that but you need to know the name you need to know that name thank you jesus because there's wizarding is that there's power in the name how many know there's power in the name how many know that there are another name given us unto heaven whether we must be saved there is power amen there's holy ghost power glory to god there's healing power there's deliverance in the name but let me ask you a question let me ask you a question tonight i i i got i got to say it like this you know i i still work for my um living and i'm not complaining about it lord bless me tremendously and in working i i see names of people that work out there and just recently i saw the name of a spanish guy jesus jesus his name is jesus and then i thought about that i thought about that bro i said now his name is jesus so i wonder whether he got the power jesus jesus i said whether he got the power i mean a lot of people use the name of jesus but how many know many of them don't have the power they don't have the power because there's something missing there's something missing people use the name of jesus to curse with it they use the name of jesus to swear with it so there's got to be a distinction between the use of the name in power and the use of the name vainly oh somebody say man somebody say hallelujah there has to be a difference notice notice this and he said i beseeched he showed me the glory in verse 18 and and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will show mercy and he said thou cast not see my face but there shall no man see men live but the lord said there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock hallelujah and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by thou i'll put thee in the cliff of the rock oh hallelujah oh thank you jesus what was going on here an anointed prophet of god an inspired prophet of god who had seen the supernatural now wanted to see the glory of god he wanted to experience more of the glory he was pleading with the the spirit god to show him no glory and the lord said i've heard you and here's what i'm going to do i'm going to show you a place and in that place i'm going to place you in that place and when i place you in that place my goodness is gonna pass by and you're gonna see the back parts of me somebody shout hallelujah how many know he's the same what yesterday today and forever and how many know what that place is that moses would put in how many know that that place is the place where the lord was

jesus somebody said he's good taste and see that the lord is good there's a little girl that was eating that apple and that infidel came to her and said what do you believe in that god why are you believing in that god i don't believe he's real i talked to an atheist here recently i don't believe that after we got done with him he started to question this is atheism i mean that little girl said this to him little girl asked him said how does this apple taste he said i don't know he said she said that's right because you ain't eating it how many of them tasted and seen that the lord is good oh somebody giving praise right now somebody's shot he's good but the last thing and i'm closing up my ipad and i'm coming down because i won't ever get this lesson done bro simmons i told bruh someone said this thing goes from genesis to revelation so i'm getting off the platform prepare prepare to see me we down in ache and i come out with all them books and everything pile projection you ain't gonna preach too long today are you and i said i'm gonna do what the lord told me to do brother somebody's out hallelujah somebody shall praise the lord how many believe god is rich in mercy how many believe god is full of grace how many believe god is good but how many believe that god is the truth oh somebody say god is the truth come on somebody said god is the truth the lord jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man can come to the father but by me how many know the night that he had to associate with his name these characteristics you say why didn't the lord when he came down why didn't he say that he was jehovah why didn't he say that he was el shaddai why didn't he say that he was elohim why did he quote the word to moses as he passed by why did he show the sevenfold characteristics of his glory you know why because his name he exalts his word above all his name the reason why people use the name of jesus and don't get no power with it it's because they reject the truth and when you reject the truth you are rejecting the name somebody say amen when you reject the truth you're rejecting the name hallelujah thank you jesus but when you receive the full revelation of the word you're receiving the name how many believe that tonight amen the bible in the book of revelation says when he came out of the sky in revelation 19th chapter he had a name and that name was written it was written and no man knew it but he himself and his name was called the word of god somebody say man hallelujah break it jesus and when you receive i'm i'm i'm just i'm i'm speaking now because i'm trying to come to a close when you receive the revelation of jesus christ from genesis to revelation and what is it it's the simple gospel when you receive the gospel of jesus christ those four living creatures that came down god's servant said that one was a face of a lion one was an ox one was the face of a man and one was a flying eagle and then he identified those four living creatures as the four gospels he identified them as the gospels and he said they're guarding they're guarding the throne room they're guarding that place where the power comes they're guarding that place where the power comes how many believe that tonight say amen and what are they revealing they're revealing jesus christ as the lion of the tribe of judah they're revealing jesus christ as the king of glory they're revealing jesus christ as a man they're revealing him as the sacrifice and they're revealing him as the eagle the world oh somebody shout hallelujah somebody shall praise the lord how many believe the gospel tonight how many believe the word of god tonight what are we receiving when we receive the word of god we're receiving the glory of god and what do we receive when we receive the glory of god we're receiving the inspiration the revelation that the saints of all received on the day of pentecost i'm about to play worse off on the music bro the disciples came to the lord and said lord tell us your place in the kingdom tell us what your place is they didn't understand his place in the kingdom and that's the first chapter and he said it's not for you to know it's not for you to know right now my place in the kingdom but in a little while you're going to receive power how many believe that he told them they're going to receive power somebody say lord give me that power you're going to receive power and when that power comes it's going to make you witnesses of me somebody say lord send me the power how many believe when the power will come it'll make you witnesses of him that's what the seals was all about [Music] and what did the disciples do what condition were they in they were afraid they had walked with jesus but jesus wasn't inside of them they had walked with him but he wasn't inside of him yet peter was so scared of getting crucified he cursed and swole that he wasn't one of them [Music] and when they went in that upper room they were cowards [Music] afraid but they went up in that upper room on the 40th day and they waited 10 days until the day of pentecost was fully come somebody say let us wait until the fullness of pentecost comes you all don't hear me tonight i'm not talking about pentecostal denominations because pentecost was the feast of the first fruit it was a feast of the harvest it was the feast where the children of israel took the first with the hops and waved it to the lord how many know tonight that we are trees and and we need to bring forth fruit how many say lord i need to bring forth holy ghost fruit somebody say lord help me to bring forth fruit thank you jesus so what did they do they went and [Music] waited until the day of pentecost fully came it was the right season it was the right time what were they doing up there in that room when they were up there they were sitting what were they doing they were worshiping what were they doing they were praying what were they doing they were singing psalms what condition were they in one mine and one accord how many know the night that the holy ghost and brought you in one mind tonight come on somebody how many know that just the preaching of the word that brought you into one mind tonight and when that day was fully come [Music] what happened all of a sudden it wasn't a cloud this time it was the pillar of fire how many to believe the pillar of fire has shown himself in our day come on somebody how many believe the pillar fire has shown himself in our day come on how many believe the pill of fire is what revealed the seals well how many believe the pillow fire is what a revelation came out of oh come on somebody how do you believe that god's servant didn't get this myself the pillar of fire came and revealed it to him somebody said hallelujah what happened on the day of pentecost a pillar of fire brought a revelation in that room [Music] the pillow of fire licked on every one of them thank you jesus and when it lit on every one of them what i believe happened when the bible said it was filled with the holy ghost you know what they were filled with they were filled with the revelation of jesus christ they were filled with the revelation of his name they were filled with the revelation of his glory they were filled with the revelation that he is the true atonement for sins they were filled with the revelation of what he did to bring them back into fellowship with god they were filled with the revelation of reconciliation from sin back to being acceptable in the beloved they were filled with his goodness they were filled with his mercy they were filled with his grace they were filled with the word somebody brave your hand [Music] somebody wave your head [Music] hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah somebody shall praise the lord don't you grieve at this don't you grieve at us don't you reject us because god's servant said the new birth is the revelation of jesus christ [Music] what happened jesus from genesis to revelation was revealed to them they now understood his position in the kingdom [Music] and by understanding his position in the kingdom they were filled with power holy ghost power somebody shot holy ghost power [Music] and they came down out of that room and when they came down out of that room they were staggering like drunk men hallelujah they were staggering like drunk men hallelujah the people said mocked them and said they're full of new wine hallelujah something had happened to them something had taken place glory to god something had happened to quicken unto them the revelation of jesus christ and that revelation gave them stimulation that revelation stimulated them because they were drinking new wine hallelujah hallelujah how many drinking that one tonight oh hallelujah thank you jesus [Music] simple isn't it it's simple isn't it it ain't complicated is it i mean no god hides himself in simplicity and is revealed in the same [Music] that same coward called peter that same coward who denied the lord so many times that a a bird crowed that same coward stood up he wasn't ashamed the gospel no oh somebody said hallelujah somebody said lord i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it's the power of god to salvation to those that believe i'm not ashamed of the gospel hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm not ashamed to be identified with christ peter stood up that old coward but now he was no coward no more brother isaiah something had happened not in his hand but in his heart his heart had been turned back somebody said hallelujah something happened in his heart his heart was turned so that's a lord turn my heart not my head but my heart then i turned my mic off the old testament coming what's written on stone on stone but how many know god said the new testament covenant what's going to be written on the tables of the heart i'm going to write my words in their hearts and their sins and their iniquities do i remember no more how many know god is writing on your heart tonight [Music] and here's the simplicity of it the atonement for sin the perpetuation for sin jesus fulfilled it he was the one that brings the gap between death and life he's the one that deserves the glory he's the one that deserves the honor and he's the one that was preached on the day of pentecost he is the sermon that was preached by peter he said you with wicked hands have taken and crucified the prince of life whom god has raised up has raised him up and this jesus who you crucified has now been made lord and christ thank you jesus how many believe that jesus is the christ wave your hands if you really believe it tonight [Music] and when the people heard that they were pricked in their hearts and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what must i do what had happened that revelation that struck their hearts now and what was the formula repent every one of you somebody shout lord help me to rebit [Music] somebody raise my hand and say lord i repent [Music] i repent lord i'm sorry i'm sorry for the life that i live i'm sorry lord for the unbelief i'm sorry for the filthy life i'm sorry
