sinner like us Lord Lord we thank you for keeping us and allowing us to come into your house one more time but we ask that you come down and move us out of the way and Lord that you may get all the glory and all the praise in Jesus name we pray amen [Music] amen amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen God is good amen if you have your Bibles tonight ask turn to Hebrews chapter actually Hebrews chapter 13 very very familiar scripture and it's very fitting the last song the brother Gordon's song I love him amen because he first loved me amen I can find what I'm looking for tonight amen and I start at verse five let us go for therefore aunti Hebrews 13 no 13 13- 5 let your conversation be without Covetous and be constant with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do to me amen and and I'll turn back to Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 6 and 7 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and Scorn every son whom he receiveth and if ye endure chastening God dealth with you as with Sons for what son is he what son is he whom the father chastenest not but with but if ye be without chastisement wherefore are you partakers then are ye bastards and not son furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and who GTH them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for there for for a few days chasing us after that our pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness amen God bless the reading of this where you may be seated amen I said the psalm was fitting because tonight I was thinking about a little subject and I entitled it God loves you God loves you and I was thinking about originally I thought about the question how do you know God loves you how do you know God loves you and I started thinking about the scripture Lord placed on my heart and and in verse six it said for whom the Lord loveth he chastens whom the Lord love is he corrects if God loves you he'll correct you and then I thought about well God loves you so much that many of times when he corrects you he gives the space and time for you to repent he gives you the opportunity for you to come to him God just don't correct you he gives you opportunity to repent and get it right and I thought about there was many stories and times in the Bible where God gave example but one that stood out to me was David and Nathan after David had done his sin and had taken Beba his as his wife Nathan came to him and God showed him what he had done David knew it was wrong but God had to point it out to him and said you did this and this is exactly what you did and this is the punishment but David got on his knees and said Lord I'm sorry even though David had the p for what he did he got the opportunity in the space to repent because God loved him and David was a man after God's Own Heart and said that God loves you and how do you know every time that you want to do something that's not right and that voice comes to you and tell you not to do it that's how you know God loves you every time that you want to make that wrong decision and God tells you don't go there you don't know what's going on but God said don't go there and you listen to that voice and you said is this me talking to myself and I heard Pastor said one time when the Lord spoke to him he said I never talked to myself like that he said when you go and you know it's wrong many of times you know deep then something that's in you saying that's not what I'm supposed to be doing that's not what I'm supposed to do that's God showing you that I love you God will protect you from things that you're not supposed to go to and he'll tell you don't do that cuz he's trying to protect you because he loves you the same way when your parent tell you not to go with hang out with those people they may not know the people but they understand what's going on why because they've been through life and they've understood things and they've experienced things that you have not experienced they've been around maybe not those people but people like them and they seen the roles that they've taken and know that those are not good paths but they tell you don't do that because they love you they love you and God loves you in the same way and the only reason he could he he chastised you is because he loves you and I started to think think about it in my own life and I started to think about I said how much God loved me when you think about the things that you've done in your life and you still get up every morning and you're allowed to repent and God and you allowed to get everything right and you allowed to thank God that he died for you you allowed to thank him and say Lord I Thank you for shedding your blood for me and he said what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus and every morning that you get up that's another opport to thank God for the opportunity to give you thanks thank God for the opportunity for you to make things right I think Solomon said Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath and I took that scripture and I said Lord every night when I go to sleep I want to make sure everything is right before you cuz he said he comes as a thief in the night you don't know when he's coming but he can come for you he could come for you at any time and you don't want nothing to stop you from crossing over but God loves you that much that he went to Calvary just for you he went there and he endured the pain he it said in the scripture he endured the cross he endured the pain just for you he endured it for your healing he endured it for your salvation he endured it so that you could overcome he endured it that you can make it to Heaven he endured these things that you think um you might not think of them but sometimes you need to be reminded you got to go back and you remind yourself what God has brought you through you got to remind yourself you know what I came through this and I came through that but it's only by the grace of God and each and every day that I get up I can say Lord I love you because you first loved me Lord I thank you because you first loved me you saw me before the foundation of the world and you still thought enough of me to decide to choose me to write my name down and say Lord put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life that's what he decided to do Just Because You Loved Me Lord just because you love me and I can never repay you for that love there's nothing there not only thing that I can do is surrender and give my life to you that's the best gift that I can give God and that's still not good enough that's the best gift that I can give him is my life and that's still not good good enough and I and I read here he said he loved you and he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you he said I think in another scripture he said I'll never leave you comfortless and and then he said he would give us the comforter which was the Holy Ghost see he loved you enough to said you know what I'm going to come down and dwell within you each and every day I'm going to walk right inside of you and I'm going to tell you and lead you and guide you each and every day now who do you know that your best friend won't even do that your best friend Won't Stand By Your Side through everything there's still going to be moments that your best friend cannot be there but God promised because he loved you so much he said I'll still be there he said I'll be there through the thick and the thin through the ups and the Downs he was still there I think I was listening one they said that God never leaves you he promised that but you can leave him you can leave God but God never leaves you and sometimes you got to go back to those moments and say where did I leave God where did I leave God you wonder why things aren't going right and say Lord I got to examine myself I got to look at myself and say why are these things not going right why why is this thing happening to me and this thing happening to me and it could be a job situation where God love you so much he said I trust you I trust you to go through this I trust you because you love me so much and it's not just what I'm doing for you that is proving my love it's not just the blessings that I'm giving you that proves how much you love me now you're not just thanking me because God has blessed me you thanking me in spite of in spite of all the blessings I can still thank God in spite of all the good I can still thank God cuz I thank him for the good and even when it's going bad I can thank God because he loved me and because he first loved us we can thank him I said it's not the question of how much he loves us but how much do you love him how much do you love him and I was reading something I want to read it tonight and he said he knew as the prophet of God said he knew as Romans 8 tells us that he could see God knew us before the foundation of the world and he said and he hated Esau and loved Jacob before they were even born God knew the children that was in the womb he knew what they were going to do and he said he hated one and he loved the other he hated Esau and he loved Jacob but either before either boy was born for his foreign knowledge allows him to predestinate all things to work together for to his good see because God created everything and God knew everything it allowed him to predestinate all things to work together to his glory that's why God could say in his word all things work together to the good because he knew all things he knew what was going to happen he knew the path that you was going to take and knew that everything was going to work out to the good so he could say with confidence I can write your name here you're gonna make it he said with confidence I can write your name there you're gonna make it he said with confidence I can write your name there cuz you're going to make it and he loved you so much he said I'm I know that they're going to make the right decision I know that they're going to choose the right path because he had four knowledge that allowed him to predestinate all things to work together to his glory that's the great Jehovah isn't it him that willth or he that runneth isn't God that showeth Mercy see God is the one that showeth mercy no matter how much you think that you do on others God still show Greater Mercy than you can ever accept or you can ever believe God to give you the mercy amen and he said that's what the scripture says so it isn't how much you try you know sometimes we look and we say well I did this and I did this and I did this so I expect this we work on a job and say well I completed this and completed that and completed this so you expect something but with God is not how much you try because you can't try enough to get what God has given you that's why he gave it as a gift there's nothing that you have to do to to get this all you have to do is accept it all you have to do is accept it so it's not how much you try is it's how much God has done for you and if you got enough a God to to come out here tonight a desire to hear the message you ought to be the happiest person in the city because God is moving in your life I thought about this and it was very impactful and said you know sometimes you try your best just to make it to the house of God and the prophet of God said if you got that desire you ought to be the happiest person here because God is moving in your life just to have the desire shows that God is moving in your life and you wonder how much God loves you God gives you desires and if your desire is to please him it means that God is moving in your life God is working in your life he's trying to lead you to the Fountain he said he loves you God loves you he loves you so much that he'll lead you to him he'll lead you out of Darkness into the light he'll lead you out of the wrong path into the right one he'll put people in your path to stop you from going in the wrong direction he'll put people there that that give you wisdom and say don't do this do this it may not you may not think of it as great things but those things can alter and change your path of your life you may not think of this person that said hey do this right here and you didn't think it was nothing big but you did it you don't know why sometimes you don't know why you listen but God is leading you and guiding you and keeping you if you give your life to him he'll lead you and guide you it's because he loves you he loves you so much that he gave his life for you all that he wants in return is your life if you to come to him and say Lord I accept you Lord I'm willing to do whatever you ask me to do and you totally give it to him many times you give it to him and you think that you're doing but then in a space of time you forget or you might or you might get slack and you and you don't do you you forget where you going and what you supposed to do and God has to remind you sometimes he takes you through trials and tribulations to remind you that I'm still God he takes you through the ups and the Downs the hills and then he takes you through the valleys so that you can appreciate the mountaintops he takes you through the valley so that you can you can understand when you get up and you can see you can look back and see where God has brought you from you can look back and say Lord thank you for loving me Lord thank you for loving me in spite of everything that I've done in spite of what people have done to me and spite of what I've been through Lord in spite of what I'm going through thank you for loving me you love me so much that you given me the desire to please you you Des giving me the desire to every morning get up and thank you you giving me the desire every day to say Lord I love you Lord I Thank You Lord I appreciate everything that you've done for me and I can't tell you enough how much I love you I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate you because he loves you and he loved us and I said how do you know he loves you because when you do wrong he will correct you when you do wrong he comes back and he he may give you that but he'll say I love you any good parent is going to do the same thing and God is the best that we can he said Our Father which aren't in heaven he's a father to you he he's a leader to you he's a God to you he's someone that'll be always be there for you there's no greater friend that you can have than the Lord Jesus Jus Christ there's no one that's going to lead you better than the Lord Jesus Christ even your parents can't lead you better than the Lord even your grandparents can't lead you better than the Lord no one can lead you better than the Lord and when he comes inside of you he'll lead and guide you each and every day but you got to listen you got to get down and you got to commune with God you got to talk to him just like every day you talk to someone else you can talk to God he don't require nothing special he don't say that you got to do it in a special Mighty way he said when the weakest Christian get on their knees to to pray then the whole Kingdom of the devil shakes cuz he know that prayer can change things he knew that prayer can can move mountains he know that prayer can come in homes and change homes he know that prayer can come and change situations that no nothing else can do it's you don't have to be somewhat great that don't have to be the pastor the preacher is when you get down on your knees and pray when you get down and say Lord I need your help there's nothing else that can help me but you there's nothing else that can change this but you Mama might have tried Daddy might have tried sister brother might have tried but no one can change this but you but God loves us enough that he allowed us to come to him and say Lord change this Lord work in this and sometimes he'll do exactly what you ask him to he'll do exactly what you ask him sometimes you have to be more specific with your prayers cuz God will do it but you might not like the process but God loves you enough to take you through the process to show you that I love you to show you that I love you and I and and that I love you so much I want what's best for you God always will give you what's best for you he won't give you what you want sometimes but he'll always give you what you need he said I promise to supply all your needs and God knew before the foundation of the world it allowed him because of his for knowledge it allows him to predestinate all things to work together for his glory amen God bless you tonight [Applause] amen said Jesus love me yet this I know because the Bible tells me so amen aren't you glad he loves you do you love him amen you can your expression to him Lord the reason my reason I live this life I don't want to be lost because I love him the reason why I come to church because I love the Lord amen and he said in his word if you love me what keep my Commandments he said when two or three of goding in my name he said forsake not to assemble yourself together isin't that right amen so those are the things that we do for and and when we get up and clap our hands it's it's all in love it's all about the love of God I get up and clap my hand I get up and tell and sing and I open my mouth and I said Lord I love you let us just stand I love the Lord and I how about sister pan I love the Lord now come on you love the devil want you to take it back amen but I love the Lord and I won't take it back I love the Lord and I won't take you I love
