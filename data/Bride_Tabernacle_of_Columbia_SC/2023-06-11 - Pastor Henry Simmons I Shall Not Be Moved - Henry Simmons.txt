that attain ordained to eternal life God you said they received the word father May there'll be individuals in here those under the sound of my voice that ordained to eternal life that will receive the word Lord and father that they might live eternally with you Lord so father I thank you Lord for the blessings upon your word in Jesus name amen Hebrews 12 and 22 it says but you're coming to Mount Zion unto the city of the Living God the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and God the judge of all and the spirit of just men made perfect and to Jesus the media of the New Covenant and to the blood of spring that speaks better things than that of Abel seeing that even see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refuse him that speaketh on Earth much more shall not re-escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised sin yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heavens and this word yet once more signify the removal of those things that are shaken and as of the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we have we may serve God acceptable as acceptably with relevant and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire may God bless you read this word you may be seated it says that we may wherefore we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptable bully with relevance and godly fear and I said I should not be rude the reason why because we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved you know it does not speak of each and every individual in here this morning or those that understanding my voice but those that understand by Revelation and by faith that you have received the kingdom that cannot be moved and having received a kingdom it becomes personal so you said I shall not be moved now for a subtop it I chose to subtopic uh fighting for survival we're fighting to survive you know it's not many that's going to stand at the end the age that we're living in will recombinant Christians are becoming extinct and at the end of the road they're not going to be many standing everybody that goes to church that say that I believe the gospel everybody that say I love Jesus at the end of the road we're fighting demons and Devils that's been let loose out of Euphrates and yet the people fail to understand that we're in a spiritual war and the spirits if it was possible there's deceived even the very lay but because of the unseen Realm folks don't realize the reality the spirit world is just as real as the things that you see that I actually are angels in the invisible Realm fallen angels and the angels of God will be an influence from beneath our form of love they're spirits that speaks to us that try to penetrate in control and press themselves into men flesh those Spirits when they press themselves into you they manifest themselves in diabolic ways uh and godly ways they is the spirit of God that will manifest itself in godliness and now demon spirits that will respond and react causing you to do things usually you look like the spirit that's in you and that's why we see people that do all kind of things to their flesh because they're trying to manifest the power that's in them so when they look in the mirror the spirit says I'm well pleased and they begin to smile because the spirit that's in them began to want to look a certain way the spirit that's any individual wants to act a certain way and nothing you can do to show that person because the spirit has possessed them and it's taken control of them and when the spirit has controlled them and they don't even understand they think that I'm walking in the knob everything is normal but as they began to drift farther and farther into the darkness of this world into the kingdom of darkness there's a kingdom of darkness as a kingdom of light we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved but the kingdom in which men are pressing themselves into is the kingdom of darkness it's like going into a deep pit going into a hole and they won't know until they find out that it's the bottomless pit that it does not have a foundation it cannot survive it cannot stand said about the serpent the serpent does not have backbone he cannot stand that's why on his belly he went once he had a backbone but now he don't have any backbone so the serpent cannot stand on this belly he went are you with me some folks amen when they began to be seduced and controlled by demon power Amen on their bellies shall they go man does not let any longer act like a human a son or daughter of God but he began to manifest the serpent seed and he began to produce the serpent and all his utility and what is happening with man they don't know the satility of the serpent how subtle the serpent is we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved we are fighting for survival you asked me will the world survive the earthquakes the storms the Hurricanes where the Earth survive the floods and all the trauma that has gone on in the earth will the world survive it the bombs that have been dropped in the shells at the people are shelling one another killing one another murdering one another shoot now one another will the young people survive what is going on will we survive will we be able to make it through this growth stock since that has covered the Earth will you survive you cannot tell me you're not being affected by the darkness of this world and things are not happening in your home and in your life and in your surrounding that you're not being touch you must know that these things these powers that are penetrating you asked me will the church survive and I'll tell you there won't be many survivors there won't be many that would say that I made it you asked me about a church that came out with two million out of Egypt how many survived the wilderness and I'll tell you there was only two standing when it was all over I'm gonna get ahead of my story but you asked me about the days of Noah and how many survived and I'll tell you that it was only eight you asked me about the Deeds of Sodom and tomorrow and the things that happened in the cities around about how many survive that was full but one looked back and turned to a pill of salt how many will survive in this day the Bible tells us as it was in the Deeds of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom thus shall it be when the day when the son of man is revealed I wonder will you be a survivor who shall be able to stand the single song My Lord getting us ready for that great day and tell me who shall be able to stand will you be standing will you be able to stand I find out that the Bible says before he's coming that there would be a great fall in the way first and that the man of sin shall be revealed and I wonder if when we speak of the church surviving the church looks like it's growing in many places but in many times the church has been blind and deceived because the devil has come in the church and I thought one day I would preach worshiping Satan in the church worshiping the devil in the church people don't know what they worship now let me as I was on my knees praying this morning and I began to go in a route that I just trying to make it clear to you because so many people are confident in their walk with God and they're so confident and they're so sure that they have the right Jesus not knowing that there's other Jesus I hear some people are confident that they know the god of the Bible but I want to know how many survived in the Old Testament Saints when Jesus came and how many was there on the upper room it was only 120. doesn't matter how what how many miracles they saw and how much they said they believed and it was only 120 that received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you can tell me that you have the correct Spirit you have the the correct Revelation you can tell me many things you can tell me that I I genuinely know where I stand I know I don't believe that there was one of them amen that was uh in the world and Jesus did that didn't weren't confident that they knew God but they couldn't see a dispensational change they couldn't see a dispensational change they could not recognize their day in this message they didn't know they they thought they had it all together but it was a change of dispensations Amen it was changing from law to Grace but they failed to recognize that the kingdom of God was being preached but they instead of coming into the kingdom they were holding on to the law and I believe that Through The Eyes of our our religious spirit we think that we have come to a place religiously that I really have Jesus I really know him so is the rest of the world we're coming until a time where everybody is saved and everybody's all right that's all right if that's what you want to believe everybody's going to heaven if that's what you want to believe there's not many that want to take a solid stand and understand what truth is all about Jesus said I am the way the truth in the life and no man can come to the father except he come by me let me just take you somewhere that I went this morning and then maybe a little difficult Galatians 1. you cannot tell me that God's chosen people that really had the bible really thought that they knew scripture and perhaps know the Bible better than you think you know it I'm not getting on you this morning but I just want you to think about it and I want you to uh just think about what the word is saying to you now you said if anybody should have known God it should have been the Jews after all that God had been with them for all that time and it was special and they were chosen and they were God's chosen people and I believe that's the way the church World believed today they're so confident that because they are the church and because they are supposedly to be a Christian Paul message was not a popular message he said he's not a Jew there's one I believe neither is the circumcision is that which is outly he's a Jew that was one inwardly in the circumcision is that of the heart and of the spirit so don't you rest in your fleshly amid recognition amen but to recognize that there has been a change and I believe that the church World failed to recognize that there is a change yes people say they preach the gospel yes they say they preach Jesus yes they say that but are they really preaching Jesus which Jesus are they preaching which gospel are they preaching yet they say I believe in a prophet I believe the message yet they say I believe I'm a this or that but what Jesus are they preaching we're so confident that we have arrived that we got something that nobody else has I all believe that no matter what persuasion they are they all believe the same thing that they got some and they are happiness shot in their prison God because they got something special feeling to recognize the god of the Bible the Jesus of scripture are you with me the Jesus that they have is they don't look like the Jesus that I see in Bible it don't look like the gospel that I see in the Bible it's strange to me but maybe you see that they believe in the same Jesus that you believe in yeah that's right they believe in the same Jesus you believe in but not to Jesus the Bible speaks of oh they believe the same now sister I believe but not the one that Paul preached not the one that Paul preached are you with me I wonder is it the one that Paul preached of one that they says that the prophet preached in this age is that the same one that it sounds a little different to me but you are succumbed by a spirit that everybody that believes that God sent a prophet is preaching Paul's gospel the gospel that Paul preached that Jesus that Paul preached I'm persuaded that I let me see let me examine and see whether or not everybody that says Lord Lord do they really believe the Lord is the Lord of their life because many shall see in that day Lord then I cast out Devils did not do this and that in your name but he's going to say depart from me you might say within your spirit who Do You Think You Are who do you think you are brother Simmons who do you think you are Pastor Simon who do you think you are Bishop Simmons or whatever you want to call me you know what I'm saying but who do you think you are it's not about me it's not about you it's the gospel it's the word that I'm concerned about the titles and the names or or who you say you believe or what you say you believe is the word are you with me I didn't come to introduce you to me or some man or some gospel that I you know I it's the Bible it's the Jesus of the Bible but do you know who the father is do you know who God is it's another thing to say you know and to think that you know God gotta do something inside your spiritual world he's got to shake your very spiritual world and let you know that you don't know as you ought to know you think that you know God but you don't know God is the god of what you perceive by your spirit you said oh you're talking to somebody I'm not talking to you don't receive that but if I'm talking to somebody let me talk to that somebody I'm not here to be analyzed amen I'm talking to you about this Bible this Bible that we say we believe I want you to believe that believe what God Said in his Bible not all the hooping and hollering and getting all the emotion and all excited by something that don't mean that you know him I don't care how large your child and how much you dance that don't mean you know him whether or not you have the life the same life that was in Jesus Christ that life in you is that Jesus in you okay let me see what Paul preached because he wasn't talking to somebody that wasn't saved or or wasn't uh Holy Ghost Field or whatever he was talking to people that's supposed to hide it the Holy Ghost people that's supposed to be saved and if you could talk to them like that then how come we can't talk like you talk and we preach the same gospel okay and that's what happens he said in the sixth verse he said I Marvel that you know what so soon remove he said I shall not be removed I'm Marvin at you so soon removed the Bible said certain men crept in unaware you allow spirits to creep in unaware men to come in unaware they're not worried about you they're worried about how much money and how much time you can pay how much money you can give they ain't worried about your soul look at them they go right after the money they're concerned about what you can give them and what you can do for them how many more people they can add to the church they're not worrying about your soul so they won't tell you the truth they'll Pat you on the back and tell you as well when they know you're on your way to hell they'll patch on the mat back and make you feel good make you feel like what you believe and what you were doing is all right even though it's contrary to the word and that favorite saying of those unbelieving devils ain't nobody perfect there ain't nobody got it all the excuse that we make when God show us his word yet we don't want to believe it we want to make excuse because we cannot fulfill the word god interprets his word by fulfilling it by manifesting it and when God's word begin to be made manifested we say I don't see it in other words you said I don't want to do it I don't want to do it and no excuse said I don't want to do it is I don't see it yeah you see it you see it but you don't want to do it and because you don't want to do it you don't believe it I see something different yeah you see something different he said I Marvel that you'll so soon removed from him that call you unto the grace of Christ until what y'all say it's not another and if I want Jesus we all serve the same law another gospel if it was one then how about now look like it was about a thousand different ones maybe a couple thousand are you up there it don't seem to be the same gospel okay which is not another but there'll be what y'all can't say it again but that'd be what some that trouble you y'all better stop patting folks on the back telling them they all right oh I know she made it I know he made it I know you you don't know yeah you know just like you making it you want to call that love call that clothes in your eyes I want to call it love I'm gonna tell you something you better stop loving what God don't he said if you love me you're what keep my commandment isn't that right you better stop talking my uh yeah you may love the person but if it's another gospel it's another Jesus don't don't just say they believe the same Jesus no they didn't they didn't believe the same Jesus I believe in they didn't believe the same gospel that I'm talking about amen other than that everybody just be going just do anything and and say you love Jesus and preach oh come on which is not another but there'll be something to trouble you and would what preserve perverted somebody is reverting the gospel but though what we are what come on I don't I don't I don't say an angel from heaven didn't speak to them and didn't tell them amen just like the women that preach I don't say an angel didn't come from Heaven told them that the preach Angel could have come from heaven and told them but he said though we are an angel come from Heaven does what preach any other are you with me I don't care who it is what does brother Simmons a brother whoever You Gotta Be You Gotta stick to this word because I said it you said well I I got confidence in him your confidence should be in this word are you up man well I know it right because brother Simmons said because there's a minute to say or because of my pastor say ah it's what the Bible says amen well I thank the Lord just because a spiritual man said it don't mean that the spiritual man sometimes can make a mistake it wasn't be a prophet was it being a angel that come from Heaven you can't you got to stay with what what's written are you up now this is a hard saying but people are just so caught up that ah I know it right because what laughs the prophet that God said I preach what Paul preached isn't that right and uh we're responsible for preaching what he preached and so we preach what Paul preached are you up man are you a man if he said I preach what Paul preached and we're responsible for preaching what Paul preached tell me you're not responsible for preaching what Paul preached well Paul didn't know this Paul didn't know that okay okay you know all these big explosive men that you got to hear and you can't hear what the Bible's saying the Holy Ghost can't reveal to you the word are you with me praise God the reason why I believe what the prophet said because I see that he's preaching what Paul preached that's why I believe it you wonder why why are you believing because he preaching what Paul preach and I believe what Paul preached are you with me amen amen you said well I ain't got no ain't got no trouble with what Paul priest are you with me he said though we an angel come from Heaven preach any other gospel then that which we preached let him be a woman why you fussing at me I ain't fussing at you I'm mad at the Devil are you up man what you fussing about today I'm mad at the Devil y'all ought to be mad at the governor too that goes about to deceive folk and try to um take people mind away from the word of God you ought to be upset with the Devil no no no no no so I'm trying to you know let you see that there has been an invasion of demon power to come to try amen to destroy the Church of the Living God are you a man but you didn't come to you know you you you come to Mount Zion amen you come to the Church of the firstborn written in heaven are you with me you come to a kingdom that cannot be moved that will not refuse this to be moved Hallelujah let me show let me try to close quickly but before I do that second Corinthians 11. it's so many places I would like to go but I I don't have time but I want you to I want to come into some clothes you hear because you allow yourself just because you said in church just because you say you're going to have to seek God to the Holy Ghost begin to reveal the word to you you're gonna have to get on your knees and you say God open the scriptures to me not just a lot you open the scriptures to the prophet Lord you're on the scriptures as a pastor but I need you to open the word to me I believe it because my paths are blessed I believe because the prophet no you've got to know it because God has revealed it to you your Revelation is personal your Revelation causes you not to bow that you stand for the word you'll stand up for Jesus because you know who he is come on somebody said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word we're talking about the word of God we're talking about God's word that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about the word of God you'll stand for the word of God are you with me somebody said well I'm standing on the word is it the word is this the Bible are you with me you got to stand on the Bible That's the word of God praise God anything else might fail you are you with me anything else might fear you it will fail you are you with me the only thing that will not fail you is the word in the beginning what the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was what made flesh are you with me the word was made flash into all the models so the Jesus that I'm preaching and the Jesus that Paul preached he was the word and he's the word now he was the word dead and he'll be the word tomorrow he's the one all the investor was the name written Lord of lords king of King the word of God amen he's the word of God when it's all over it's going to be the word of God not man world is going to be the word of God as you're going to be judged by anything you're going to be judged by what's written in the book are you it ain't gonna be what Brother Sam was saying what somebody man said it's going to be the word of God are you up there so don't get upset with me because I believe the Bible are you a man supposed to get mad at you they get upset because they got more confidence in what somebody else said then they got confidence in what the Bible said oh you look man we got more confidence and how they believed and what the word said the word is the word of God Is Right okay so a second Corinthians 11 and 4 it says for if we pre if he that Comet preached what whom we have not what uh if you receive a what which we have not what uh another what which ye have not what you might as well bear with him amen now you tell me how can you equate uh how can you separate the Jesus of the Bible from the word of God the gospel amen should be Jesus Christ and he's the word are you with me why come people amen think they got Jesus and they amen and they don't bleed the word oh God Jesus I know he died for my sin I know but I don't believe what he said in the word are you a man what's Jesus is it the Jesus of the Bible it is the Jesus that you've conquered up in your mind and you receive another Spirit or is it the Jesus of the Bible tell you something things might have happened to your life things might have happened in in your walk things about to happen in the church let things might have happened to your preacher things might have happened all kind of ways but I want you to know one thing when it all bows down amen I want to know who's going to be able to stand who what what he said you did run well who didn't hinder you amen what do you did you run away when you're when you hurt in the water what made you run the Bible says right division make it plain he didn't read it that you may be able to run are you with me but a vision is for a point in time I believe this is the time to run if you're ever going to run this is the time you ought to be willing to run I believe that it's another gospel it's another Jesus because when you look in the word and you see what the word is saying about it and you look at what the church is saying about it or what some preacher's saying about it I say Amen it's just not because hey I I believe that God sent a word in our days to reveal a word of God but it hasn't been revealed but is it revealed to you no we're good God said a reveal word he said the word in the power of those days but it wasn't revealed to those Jews he said it to them he came into his own his own receiver this is in whom is the arm of the Lord Who Shall Believe I report isn't that right but who God has to reveal itself to you as an individual are you with me but you're interested what are we gonna reveal whether I have all I can do say what he say come on brother sister you gotta see this word be revealed to you just by revelation upon us right now build my church in the what the Gates of Hell shall not what Prevail amen by Revelation the rock of Revelation got to be revealed to you as an individual it can't be a collected thing it's an individual God revealing himself to you that he died for your sin he's shouting this Precious Blood for you until you believe Jesus did it for you amen and he has a kingdom that you can come into and he wants to deliver you from the power of Darkness and he wants to translate into his kingdom hey God do it for me oh God miss somebody see the other Kingdom in invisible Kingdom that God wants it to be visible to you God wants to show you his kingdom God wants to reveal his kingdom to you God wants you to see his glory amen God wants you to see his power Hallelujah yes it's an individual Journey brother sister going to church hooping and hiding but God hadn't spoke and revealed himself to them another just sitting around and don't know why I'm here while I exists and they'll continue to do that they may get 60 70 years old and they just around become religious never have revelation never walk in the power of God never amen receive the blessings that have been given to them by inheritance through the blood of Jesus Christ never taking full advantage of the glory that has been revealed because it hadn't been revealed to them as individuals amen this Bible amen when Paul began to open it up the Old Testament amen it was minutes that was a trouble and some was moved amen but there was others that said amen I'm gonna take a firing stand even Peter said Paul spoke things hard to be understood but you know one thing I'm gonna do I ain't gonna wrestle against him and I'm telling you don't wrest against those things that Paul said to your own destruction amen Paul said Peter said I'm backing up Paul I might have the keys but Paul got Revelation that amen looked like a lord hi for me but one thing's about it I know God is speaking and God is revealing amen the Holy Ghost is bad witness with what Paul preached amen praise God and the Holy Ghost if you receive the right Spirit you'll receive the Holy Ghost it's going to be our witness to what the Bible says my last scripture was in uh uh Matthew 24 and I'm and that's it Matthew 24 35. it says here he says Heaven and Earth shall what pass away but my what my words shall never pass away oh you would be I shall not be moved amen it's the word of God are you with me if you're not going to pass away he said you abide in me what my word abide in you then you can walk acts what you will and not doing praise God I'm telling you it's not about coming to church and not about locking brother Simmons and not a lot of blocking Brian Tabernacle it's about Jesus Christ amen do I'm talking about the Jesus of the Bible here's the word and when you find people preaching another gospel preaching that is all right for this and all right for that and telling you everything gonna be all right all you got to do just believe in Jesus but the Jesus that they believe in and not the Jesus of the Bible are you with me that's not the one says amen before Abraham was I am it's not God almighty praise God the devil believes but the Bible said he what he believed that there's one God but he trembles praise God he don't he can't be mean manifested neither could Judas received the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God that there are many amen that have the same spirit that can't receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost why praise God because their spirit is not right in the inside brother and sister they'll be many that cannot receive Jesus of the Bible why because they wouldn't ordained the believing praise God the Jesus of the Bible are for those that were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's the Jesus of the Bible that's the Jesus that we preach the Jesus that died on the cross Jesus that rose again the third day Jesus said that I have to wait truth in the life amen is the god of the Bible I'm out for I'm the beginning and I am in I am the first and I am the last amen it may sound like what everybody else says praise God but in between the lines amen there's a amen there's Matthew Mark Luke and John amen and they're the full living creatures God in the book of Acts and if you want the power of God in the church you've got to come by and make the full gospels you got to come by the blood of Jesus if you come by the blood amen you can have that says Amen to the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you can come into the kingdom of God but you got to come by the cross you can't bypass the cross or they make the heavens and hurts are gonna pass away but I heard him say here amen by my word let's go ahead and do it forever praise God the word of God is going to be here I'm gonna answer my faith praise God doesn't matter what the rest of the world do it doesn't matter what others do I'ma anchor my faith you can't add to this Bible you can't take away from the Bible amen the Bible is right somebody wrong I know my Bible's right somebody wrong praise God I'm gonna preach Jesus let him crucify I preach what Paul preached somebody might be upset with it but I'm preaching what Paul preached amen folks don't like you because you preach what Paul Frees Pope to turn away from you because you preach what Paul preached praise God you preach the Bible praise God there's not many Gonna Stand there's not many some if God don't reveal itself to you that he is the word you'll never see all you see is he's Jesus he's my savior but he's not my law that's what they see so the Lord rules amen you bought with the price in you not your own you can't do what you want in that praise God you've been involved with the price the church that he's purchased with his wife own blood it was his blood not yours but it was his blood amen you're the purchase of his blood and the light that was in the blood he gives back to you that you can he cannot deny what himself God will never deny you amen because you're not just amen you you see what it is it doesn't matter how much I can say they ain't none of my son over there on the Oregon amen the blood test was proven and the blood were proven amen and that's why he wrote your name on the land book of life before what the foundation of the world it sounds good to a Believer it sounds good to somebody that it means something to do but others It Don't Mean a Thing to them Jesus died don't mean a thing to them Jesus blood don't need a thing to them why because they don't believe it and they don't want to receive it so no matter how much and how loud you holler and how much you tell them Jesus loves you they don't believe it they want nothing to they'll come to church they'll be faithful paying their tithes and their offering and they'll never be able to live nothing that's why they all twisted up tied up tangled up doing all kind of crazy stuff and talking about they believers see what the word said it won't can't manifest it why because they all messed up takes full of repentance pick somebody to Humble themselves and say Lord I want to I want to be one with you I'ma humble myself I'm humbling myself I want to go to heaven because that's where I came from I want to go back to where I came from God bless you let us stand praise God are you willing to give up the world and to come into the kingdom I'm not talking about the kingdom the Farrakhan priest I'm talking about the kingdom of God I'm not talking about the kingdom to some of these folks that's what I preach the gospel I'm talking about the kingdom of God where God makes the changes in your life no more what I want to be is what he wants me to be he wants to live inside of you are you willing to accept Jesus Christ this morning are you willing to accept his plan do you
