his presence and amen i believe that he promised us in his word where two or three would gather in my name that i'd be there in their midst and so i believe with all of surety that he's in our midst because he promised he would be amen i wonder just before we would look to the word of god if we could just bow our heads and hearts and if you have a need on your heart and in your life if you want to lift your hand and ask the lord to remember you i can promise you he's still ministering healing he's still ministering victory he's still given deliverances he's still moving he's still real amen he's just looking for somebody to take him out his word so let's just do that this morning lord jesus lord we stand here lord just in awe of your presence when we get in your presence we realize how insufficient that we are lord we realize how little that we are when we stand but lord when we stand at the the very feet of the king of glory and lord we know that you're here in our midst because you promised you would be and lord i pray that you just take this platform this morning lord the lord may you just take your seed in our hearts and our ears that you could hear through our ears lord i pray lord may you not just be an onlooker or a bystander but i ask you this morning may you participate in this service almighty god well we don't want to leave you in the corner unwelcome lord we're not here to run this service we're not here to take control over it but lord we're here to let go and to let the spirit of almighty god take this service lord i pray every hand that was raised this morning lord behind that hand was a need lord and i'm just asking that you would go to every single hand that was raised almighty god lord may you minister healing minister victory lord lord all the diversity of needs that may be here this morning lord there's not a single one of them that's too great for our god lord we thank you that you're such a great god this morning we give this service to

you the praise the glory and the honor for it because we know you'll be the one only worthy of it we give this service to you lord in the name of jesus christ we humbly pray and the church said amen and amen may god bless you if you have your bibles we'll go straight into the scripture i would like to read in the book of john the eighth chapter and the 31st verse we'll read down uh to the thirties to the 34th verse amen we just certainly counted an honor and privilege to be here with you and i'm glad to have my wife here with me traveling down with us this morning and certainly appreciate brother henry and the invitation to come amen he's been preaching longer than i've been alive probably times two and so i counted the great honor and i certainly appreciate brother henry and all the work he's done for the lord through the years and i know you've got a good pastor and just a good man of god and so we certainly appreciate him and any other ministers here i think brother caleb uh we certainly appreciate him and all the work he does here in this assembly amen we're just happy to be a christian this morning aren't you amen so may god bless you uh the book of john in the eighth chapter i will read the 31st down to the 34th the bible i would read this and say jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free then they answered him we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how says thou ye shall be made free and jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin amen whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin we ask that god will bless his word as you can be seated and just for a few minutes of time this morning i want to speak to you on the subject of made free by the truth a man made free by the truth how many believes according to the scripture that the truth makes us free is that right amen the bible said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and i just love the way that the bible reads that amen the bible doesn't say that the truth shall make you bound or the the truth shall make you in fear the truth shall bring you in bondage but the bible tells us that the truth of god makes us free and and so you you can never have any other product but freedom when you have the truth is that right amen you can't have bondage when you're underneath the truth you you can't have uh you you can't be bound when you're underneath the truth because amen the truth of the word of almighty god is what makes us free now now we all know that we live in an age that is blind miserable naked and knows it not amen the age that we're living in everybody thinks that they're right everybody's got an opinion an idea and everybody thinks that they have the truth but i i want to go on record this morning and say the only true one is god amen the only the only person whose word that i that i know without any doubt and without any without any fear the only person that i know who's got the truth and their words as god almighty and him alone amen i'll i'll just go ahead and preach on this for a moment amen the words of a man can fail you my word can fail you anybody's word can fail you amen if you ever if you're ever searching for truth just look for the truth that is god's word it's the truth amen there's no lie in it there's no deception in it it is the truth of almighty god and i tell you i like the way in romans 3 and 4 the bible would read this no god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written let god be true but every man a liar and i i put my word with the bible let every man's lie and let every man's word be a lie let every man's idea be a lily that every man's little pet saying be alive let let's let god's word be true this morning amen we don't have to worry about if god's word is true all of his word amen not just a verse here or verse here but all of god's word is the truth amen all of god's word is the truth and all of his word has the power to set you free amen all of his word has power to set you free you say well preacher i think this verse can do it and this verse can do it all the word of god is powerful and in all the word of god there is freedom in every word of god amen let god be true but every man a lie amen i just want to publicly say all my ideas they're wrong all my thinking is wrong all my uh amen what i think about the bible is wrong but what the bible says is true amen church let's just be real with ourselves amen that's the way we got to come to god the only thing that's true is your word lord the only saying i can put my faith on is your word i mean the only thing i can believe was no doubt and no fear and no question whether or not it's the truth is the word of almighty god hallelujah amen i know this much that god is obligated to the truth amen god is obligated to his own word is that right amen god ain't obligated to my word he's not obligated to your word he's not obligated to our ideas and our thinking but god is obligated to fulfill his own word because his own word is truth and i i just say this god ain't going to stand behind a lie god ain't going to stand behind deception god ain't going to stand behind an idea but god will stand behind his word and he'll vindicate it when it's his word amen i'm just going to preach for a minute god ain't going to stand behind my thinking he won't stand behind my idea he won't stand behind my thoughts but i know this and i've seen it time and time again i have watched the god of this bible stand behind his word amen and he's never failed to do it he has always stood behind his word when the bible said he's a faithful and merciful high priest i'm a witness that he's faithful and he's always stood behind it can i get a witness this morning has god been faithful has god been true has he been faithful he's always been faithful he's never been a god that you can't rely on he's never been a god that our question of he was faithful but i knew because it's in his word that he's a faithful god hallelujah has he ever not answered a prayer no has he ever not healed our bodies no he must stand behind the truth of his own word and he'll do it right here this morning i said i'll do it about here this morning if you meet god on the vines of his word like any other person has in this bible i will promise you he will meet you upon the basis of the truth of the word of god hallelujah he won't meet you on a lie amen god won't meet you on a lie but i'll meet you on the truth is that right god won't stand behind a lie but he will stand behind the truth amen church what a what a place to stand on to realize that when we read this bible and we have the truth of the word of almighty god amen we can come to god with such a boldness amen that's why the bible said in the book of hebrews come to god boldly amen come to us from boldly knowing that he must stand behind his word i tell you i rejoice in that to realize amen that the very creator of the heavens he's placed handcuffs on himself he's placed handcuffs on himself he literally and see he don't mind doing it either he don't mind binding himself to his own word it's amazing to realize that god he's handcuffed himself to where he is duty-bound obligated to his own word amen so when you come to almighty god in prayer and say god you promised this you promised i can lay my hands on the sick you are bound to your truth hallelujah amen god when you said that we could pray and you would hear from heaven he's obligated to give ear preach with me somebody he's obligated to give ear to your prayer he has made himself duty bound obligated amen to his own word and i'll say this he doesn't mind being bound to his own word but god wants to fulfill his word and your life he's not amen he ain't ashamed to have to stand behind it because it's the truth and he wants to stand behind his own word he's just looking for somebody to get bold enough i said he's looking for somebody to get bold enough that would say god this is the truth and this is your word and i'm gonna stand on out on your truth because i know your god and in you is no lie in you is no deception and you must stand behind the truth i know that you'll do it oh yeah what what about it this morning i mean what if god got some of his children to step out on the truth and say god i'm gonna believe you for my healing i'm gonna believe you from my family i believe you from my church i'm gonna believe you for this issue amen try the lord this morning and see if he's able hallelujah try the lord this morning and see if he's able to do what he said he would do i'll say time and time again he will stand with his word thank you sir i said he'll stand with his word the truth shall make you free so you see the truth don't mind you is that right the truth does not bind the believer now i know there's there's preachers there's men through the ages they've took this bible they made condemnation you know what i'm talking about they've took the word they took the unadulterated truth of god and they put minds on people they bound them with fear they bound them with fears they bound them with sad but god never intended for his word to be used to bind anybody hallelujah he never intended to use the truth to bind anybody but he did intend to use the truth to set you free amen not to bind you but set you free amen now the devil wants to take the truth and alter it and make it be bondage make it be fear make it be complex and make it be everything god didn't intend for it to be but god wants to take the truth and he wants to set his children free by that truth god don't want to use his truth and beat you over the head with it he don't want to use his truth to make you live in fear brother he wants to use his truth to free the church of the living god there is freedom in the word there is liberty in the word in the truth of god his liberty and freedom for all glory to god in the truth not a lie amen let's ask the question who is the truth what is the truth who has the truth god does hallelujah amen god has the truth i love the way the bible reads in numbers 23 19 amen god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent amen so god ain't like everybody else that's made a promise god ain't like everybody else just gave you his word god is not a man that he should lie or like someone that would have to repent in other words he's never had to take it back when his truth hey man he's never had to take it black when it was true but see you ever tell a lie you got to tell another lie to cover up that lie then another lie to cover up that lie but if you tell the truth the whole time amen you tell the truth the whole time you don't have to worry about covering it up amen i just want to say this god has never had to cover up any of his word and because he couldn't keep it he's never had to cover up the truth because he wasn't able to fulfill it but we know the truth of god and it is his word amen i just want to preach this for a moment i remember that truth as a person truth is a person you say who you talking about it ain't me it ain't your pastor amen it ain't somebody else the truth is the person who's the person jesus christ the word is the truth i'll tell you i got to praying on this brother henry i got to praying and thinking meditating on i thought my god i have actually met truth in the form of a person when i have had an experience with jesus christ hallelujah and i got to thinking on the ministry the earthly ministry of jesus christ when he was upon the earth amen and he took the scroll from the priest and he quoted out of isaiah's he said the spirit of the lord is upon me i'm going to bring good tidings to do so forth i'm going to bring liberty to them that are bound i meant to sell liberty to them that are bruised and i got to thinking on his message when he was on the earth i thought my god when truth was in a person when truth was in a body all he did was glory all he did was set liberty to them that were bound when truth was in a person he brought liberty he brought deliverance he brought healing he brought everything we had need of and i want to say this the person of the truth is in this pulling this morning and he can walk right up the aisle right to where you are and can do the same thing that he did when he was in that body the truth is a person and that person is here glory to god and you want to know how he acts he acts the same way that he did today when he was in that body come on he acts the same way he did when he was in that body he ain't here to bind your worship he ain't here to bind your praise he ain't here to bring sickness he's here to bring deliverance he's here to bring liberty he's here to hear your family he's here to help your marriage he's here to bring your lost loved ones back hallelujah he's here to amen he's here to lay his hands on the sick he's here to do everything that he did back then because truth never changes and the same thing truth did then is the same thing that truth does today hallelujah we're thankful for the truth we're thankful for the truth jesus christ is the truth hallelujah amen and when the truth is preached it does the same thing that it has always done the truth has never lost his effect the truth has never lost his ability even the truth has never lost any power but it is this it's the same truth that it has always been and in malachi 3 he said i am god and i changed not i'm the truth and i don't change hallelujah and the beginning was that truth the word and the truth was with god and the truth was god his word let's i'm not changing the scripture but his word is truth and in the beginning was truth the truth was god amen and that is the truth it's god almighty amen i want you to notice this god he's been truth all the way from before the foundations of the earth was ever laid he at any time has never lied at any time he's never been a deceiving god i mean at any time amen at any time he's never been faith amen never not been faithful to his own truth but he's been the truth the whole time and that truth has never changed and i love the scripture in john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you and all truth amen when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you back to truth so the spirit of truth brings you to the truth hallelujah in other words the holy ghost brings you to the truth not to a lie not to an idea but it brings you to the truth of the word of almighty god hallelujah now i want you to notice during the beginning with adam and eve god gave them the truth in the beginning did he not him and god spoke to him in genesis 2 and 16 and said the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden i must freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in that day that thou eat us thou shalt surely die now god gave his children in the beginning the truth of his word amen you can eat of any tree in this garden but the tree in the midst of the garden don't eat it for when you do eat it you shall surely die amen now they didn't have a whole lot of commandments to live by they didn't have a whole lot of word to live by but god gave them truth to live by now i want you to notice i mean i noticed the estate that they lived in amen when god gave them that word they were not in bondage hallelujah they were not in bondage but they could come to god in the cool of the evening they could fellowship they could talk to him he would talk back they could commune with god almighty they had such a amount such a pure and holy fellowship amen a communion between god and man and they had the truth but see the truth did not bring the bondage amen the truth did not amen the truth did not run them out of the garden of eden the truth brought them into fellowship the truth brought them into communion but see notice the devil he wants to pervert the truth amen he wants to change the truth is that right he wants to change it just a little bit now don't change all of it but just a little bit amen he wants to change it just a little bit i remember by doing so he kills all of it by changing one word and i want to say this if you want to change one word from this bible you're going to kill all of it you're going to lose all of the life that's in it you change just the least of it you're going to kill all of it amen that's what satan wanted to do he wanted to change anybody you you realize that the devil hates you having liberty the devil hates you having freedom and when the devil hates you being a free son of god he hates you coming to church lifting up your hands getting in spirit worshiping in spirit worshiping and truth and when the devil hates that more than anything when you enter into worship in spirit because then it's such a it's such a true pure worship when you go beyond the fleshly worship and you go into worship and spirit and so what he wants to do is bind all of that he wants to hinder all of that amen he saw adam and eve he thought my god i cannot stand the way that they fellowship with him they talk to him he talks to them they have such a they have such a community i can't stand to do it that was his motive see the devil wants worship he wants he he wants all that he wants to be god he hated seeing the fellowship so he thought what i'll do is i'll come to eve and say eve exactly what did god tell you well here's what he said we can eat any tree that's in the garden but the one in the midst of the garden we can't eat it or will die and then what did he do he changed one word not thou shall not surely die i mean he thought well i guess this is a pretty good idea i'll go ahead along with it but she didn't take it back to the word come on she and take it back to the word be very careful when you don't take it back to the word death is knocking at your door take it back to the word line it up with the word and then you keep the life but when you alter the word death enters in and that's what happened to them hey man she said well i think that's a pretty good teaching there i shall not surely die why it's a fruit to be desire to make one wise i'll just go and take a bite notice this even when she did what god told her not to when she broke the truth when she broke the word that god had given them amen now comes all of these emotions guilt shame depression amen all of these all of these different spirits amen the spirit of depression says wait a minute now i've got an attack on him hey man he flies up from hell and he attacks himself to eve's spirit is that right amen guilt and shame they say wait a minute here's an open door and it's humanity they fly up they go to even adam and they attach on to their spirits and then now they're forced out of the garden of eden and now they have shame and depression and guilt they have all of these spirits that attack themselves and they're walking away they're walking around having to carry these things and having to deal with these things because they left the binds of truth it was their bondage i just want to say this the truth is not made to bind you the truth is here to set you free come on church amen god's word is not bondage to you it's the greatest freedom that you can experience on this side of eternity hallelujah the world has no freedom to offer you drugs alcohol all of these things they're a temporary escape from reality but there is no freedom in that the only freedom is the truth of god's word and they're here with all of this bondage now all of these things their only hope i said their only hope to get rid of this was the man named truth hallelujah the person named truth which was god was their only way out they had to carry all this baggage but church truth has come down in this generation he has made himself known to the church of the living god hallelujah he has made himself known unto the bride of jesus christ by revealing himself more and more and more and we know truth greater than we've ever known it hallelujah glory to god after disobeying the truth and shot them straight in the bondage and they became servants to sin amen they no longer could worship could fellowship could have communion because after leaving the truth was bondage amen after disobeying the truth was bondage hallelujah amen as i said there in the scripture in john 8 34 jesus answered them saying verily verily i say unto you whosoever commandeth sin is the servant of sin so you seek the truth was there freedom in the beginning and god has never changed the truth that was the freedom in the beginning is the truth today and the same freedom they had back then you can have the same freedom amen here this morning who can be as free as they were back then when the prophet quotes up there and contend for the faith he said you see it's the truth that makes you free jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me so he actually ties those scriptures together and says it's the truth that shall make you free and then he quotes there amen in the book of john 5 24 but he that heareth my word amen so for the truth that set you free you've got to hear the truth and you've got to know the truth so it's beyond just hearing it but you have to know that it is the truth and i believe i'm looking at a class of people brother we've not only heard this thing but we know this thing hallelujah we've not only heard it's the truth but we know it's the truth you say how do we know it because we've experienced it brother we've experienced the truth of the word and the power to set one free hallelujah amen i know the world they say well i don't think it's freedom to have to come to church three times a week two times a week why i tell you i just don't think it's freedom that y'all can't go here and you can't go here and you can't go here and that's just a big cult use following and you can't do this and you can't do this well i got news for them my want-to's have been changed i no longer want to go to them places we no longer want to do the things that the truth don't want us to do but all we want to do is live by the truth hallelujah live by the truth do what it says do and don't do what it says don't do hallelujah well i tell you y'all just in bondage you got to do this you got to do this but see to the believer it's a want to we want to come to church we want to hear the truth we want to hear god's word amen listen it's at the preaching of the truth that hearts and lives are changed the bible says he sent his word and he healed the people he sent his truth and he healed the people hallelujah amen he that heareth and knows the truth of my word shall be made free i tell you i love how the bible reads it you shall know the truth and that truth shall make you free amen i'll tell you it tops very very beautifully there with the old testament i'm sure you're taught very well here but you notice there in the old testament that jubilee trumpet that would sound i mean now there was many people that could hear that trumpet mean many people could hear that trump but amen but not a lot i mean if you didn't know what it meant amen you could not respond to jubilee is that correct if you did not know what the jubilee trumpet then you would not know that it was declaration that you could go free now what was it every 50 years amen anybody that was a slave to amen that was a slave to their taskmaster they was a slave to any amen any particular movement there was a slave underneath that amen there would be an opportunity under the law that every 50 years jubilee trumpet could sound and if you heard the trumpet oh god if you heard the trumpet it was an opportunity it's either now or never hallelujah it's either now or never if you heard the trumpet sound but you did not owe another day to the taskmaster you didn't know another minute to the taskmaster but when the trumpet sounded it meant you could go free and the prophet taught me that when you hear the sounding of the truth of the gospel when you hear that certain trumpet sound it is a sound that you can lift your hands and you can drop those habits you can drop those spirits you can let go of them and you can go free i want to go on record today and say church of the living god the trumpet has been blown this morning it's your battle and drop that thing today drop that spirit today let it go and let god consume it hallelujah you heard the truth of that trumpet knew it was the truth you could go free see you don't have to waste another minute in bondage but somebody could say well i tell you i just don't understand that trumpet there it it sounds a little funny okay that's fine you i mean you want to argue with the trumpet go ahead but i'm going free hallelujah you want to argue with the trumpet i mean you want to argue with it you go ahead and argue but i'm free brother i'm free sister i don't have time to argue with it i'm enjoying my freedom i don't have time to argue with the truth i enjoy the truth i enjoy my freedom i enjoy my liberty you say preacher you're crazy i know i'm crazy but i've been freed by the truth hallelujah he told me i could stand justified sanctified as though i never done it in the first place you realize where you stand today that god don't even see your sin if that ain't a reason to shout i don't know what it is god sister you're saying i even imputed to you no longer your past ain't imputed to you no longer god has put it in the sea of forgetfulness he don't even remember it you say who said that preacher the truth said so the truth said i won't remember it the truth said i'll put it behind me god has lost his memory over the bride he don't even remember it he said well i'll tell you i was to god that we would catch his mind some of us are beating ourselves up over stuff we did 20 years ago some of you are reminiscing on mistakes you made 15 years ago how about you drop that thing some of y'all can even reminisce on a mistake you made yesterday but the truth said hallelujah the truth said that you ask him he is just to forgive you you say how long does it take just like that how long does it take for him to get my mistakes just like that amen he can put it behind him way easier than you can do and he don't remember it no longer that's what the truth said hallelujah do you love the truth hallelujah i love the truth amen he set me free i ain't even tell your neighbor i love the truth brother hear me i love the truth i used to be a young man that was bound but the truth set me free i love the truth amen y'all know what i'm talking about you used to be in all kind of shackles didn't you used to be all bound by every spirit out of hell but you met the truth one day and the truth set you free yes sir if you heard the trumpet heard it sound and knew what it meant you knew you could go free i mean i i tell people i don't have time to argue at all i'm not arguing with the truth that god has sent us i'm not debating on it i received the truth and i have received my freedom hallelujah i love the way the bible i even would talk about their rahab in the old testament many of you know the story they have the harlot such a such a powerful illustration in that even in the bible she's known as ray had the harlot but see the bible says that she had received them spies with peace amen she had received i mean received that message with peace and said this i mean i know this is your land i know this is yours amen the bible says she received it with peace and when she received what god sent her way amen and in doing so the bible were to give the record here and amen in joshua 2 and 12 i just read it here now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shown you kindness that you will also show kindness under my father's house and give me a true token and that you will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death and notice the spies response in this and the men answered her our life for yours if ye out or not this our business it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee amen so she had received a word from these two spies i mean that the lord is going to deal kindly with you ain't the lord is going to remember you but they told them late even they they told me how later you just hang out that scarlet cord god will see that scarlet cord and he will remember how you treated us he'll remember how you brought us in god will remember your household when the token is on display amen god will remember it you believe that amen god will remember it when the token is on display and there's something so beautiful in this because they're receiving the truth from these messengers i mean they're receiving the truth from them even that god would remember her i tell you i began studying on this i felt like rejoicing i mean because her very own city which was jericho in that city that was walled even she had the reputation of being a harlot she had the reputation of being a sinner she had all these people that knew her issues that knew her past that knew her problems and when she heard that truth and she heard the truth that god was going to remember her i mean i'll tell you even they began marching around them walls i even come to that sixth time watching around the trumpet blew and that seventh time marching around that trumpet blue i tell you i can imagine her being in that house saying any moment now i'm gonna have freedom like i never had i'm gonna have liberty like i've never had it was at the sounding of the trumpets hallelujah it was at the sounding of that seventh trumpet she begins hearing the creak and and the crackling and the crumbling and everything around her it begins to fall down and i tell you i i started studying on that i thought it was so powerful amen all of her people and all these people that had a reputation of her being a harlot was destroyed when god destroyed the city he destroyed her past it goes to show you when god frees you when the son of man frees you you're free indeed you're not partially free you're not a little bit free but you're free indeed i love this all of her past was destroyed all of her past was over all of her sins were over everything was destroyed when she heard that trumpet sound it was freedom hallelujah i tell you what she could begin rejoicing she could begin rejoicing knowing i've already i've got the token on display and all them angels they're destroying everything around me i've got this on display and god is remembering me amen come on church churches are falling apart people are losing their minds this world is crumbling down but the bride has their token on display and the death angel is passing over by the enemy churches are dying churches are getting cold they're getting lukewarm but we've got the scarlet cord and the death angel has to pass over hallelujah the death angel has passed over you with the token on display all the churches are dying whether they're losing their minds they remind you of your past but god has remembered you death will not come here hallelujah death will not come to this house the death angel has no power here hallelujah i said the death angel brother he don't have power here i've got my token in my hand come on somebody wave it before that old devil and say you can't have it i've got my household i've got my family i've got my joy i've got my needs show that devil your token today i've got the truth he promised it he told me so he's a faithful god glory to god give god praise this morning you're a free church take them handcuffs off yourself come on somebody take them handcuffs off your worship take them handcuffs off your praise you're free young man you're free brother back there in the video area you're free this morning the devil's trying to attack himself on you he's trying to bind your worship he's trying to bind your liberty but god said you're free so let's act like it today we are free sons and daughters of god and we're acting in our freedom acting in our liberty he who the son has made free he is free indeed [Applause] you say what's causing this preacher the truth the truth is a person he's walking by your aisle right now i said the truth is a person he's going by your pew right now you say what's he doing he's bringing liberty to them that are bruised he's bringing revival to those that are dead he's bringing healing to those that are sick he's the mighty god hallelujah he's the prince of peace he's a great and mighty conqueror [Music] hallelujah he said preacher i i don't know about that i don't know about all that freedom well she felt the way we do hallelujah i don't know about that noise you even realize our prophet really killed that he really killed that dancing one time he really killed that victory he said i looked over and i saw them dancing and i thought why in the world why are they acting that way he said open up my bible and i looked in the truth and i noticed that the victory brought on some dancing that dancing is associated with the victory he said so i didn't take the dance out of the church i didn't take the shot out of the church i just said god give me victory like never had before give me victory lord and i may dance before you like david dance you say preacher we've not had dancing in this church in years we'll let the victory hallelujah let the victory come by your address he'll put a tap on your feet he'll put a joy in your heart look to god i said glory to god we're free this morning ain't that what they would do they climb on top of that hill a strong man would do it and that right a strong man would climb on top of that hill and would stand up there because some people that was down in the valley [Music] i'm gonna preach on this for a minute some people were down in the valley and they they weren't quite getting the message brother they weren't quite really entering in what was going on oh god some people were so low in that valley it wasn't really registering with him they said what in the world is all that shouting on the mountain what in the world's all that victory up there what's all that freedom about and so a strong man he would get on top of the mountain he would scream out the trumpet's been blown the trump has been blown and it goes to show it no matter how low you are in the valley it don't matter true it don't matter if you're underneath the valley if you hear the slightest blow of that trumpet brother i will stop what you're doing and say god this is my moment this is my service this is my opportunity amen this is my hour to receive my deliverance glory to god hallelujah god don't make slaves he frees them hallelujah i said god don't make slaves he frees them amen direct quote god does not make slaves he frees them amen so whenever you find yourself getting bound in your worship getting bound in your praise i want you to remember these words god ain't doing that to you i said god ain't doing that to you even when he tries to come and quieten things down well y'all just don't don't don't don't do what you're doing there i mean there's something i've studied our adversary you ever studied him i mean i've studied my adversary and i realized what he wants to do i've seen him in church services before i mean some people get free in their emotion they may cry a little bit they may lift their hands they they'll get free in their emotion but you see they're not really having a breakthrough in their spirits they're not really having a true breakthrough amen and you'll watch that stay on them i i'm gonna expose it here for a minute because it's the devil that does that it is not god that does that we're clear it's the devil that does that amen somebody will get free in their emotion they'll have a little bit of emotional worship but jesus came to that woman at the well and said what the hour is coming when they that worship me will worship me in spirit and in truth hallelujah so god is desiring more than just a fleshly worship but he wants it in spirit and in truth and the devil wants to get in the spirit i am going to hang on to you and tack himself to you and say remember yesterday remember two weeks ago remember this remember that and he'll keep your hands down if you let him i said if you let him he'll keep your hands down but i tell you i heard a story one time a preacher was preaching on it amanda amen there was a boy i'm just going to obey the lord i hope it's okay amen there was a boy i mean he would always go to school go down this certain road and that was this man had this restaurant he had his couple ducks out there and this boy would just kick rocks as he was going to school aiming kicking rock after rock after rock and one day he kicked one of them rocks and he hit that duck and killed it and the restaurant owner ran out and said son you just killed my duck how the world could you do this you you killed my duck and the boy and finally he said well sir i'm i'm so sorry i've done this what can i do to make it up to you he said i'll tell you why i'm going to tell your daddy unless you come in here every evening after school and you wash these dishes he said well sir don't tell my dad i'll be in so much trouble i mean so every day after school this boy went and served his duty he went and washed the dishes and went back home hey his dad asked him there he said something why you keep coming home late well i'm studying more he keep coming home late kept washing the dishes washing the dishes serving the senate serving a sentence and the boy did this week after week after week and eventually he got so fed up with her he thought my goodness i've done paid my debts oh he told him he said listen i've i've watched this was for you for two months he said i think i paid he said boy i'm gonna tell your dad hey myself the boy went to his dad and said dad begin to get my and give him a massage and start buttering him up and said dad at least i need to tell you something he said what is it son he said well i'll tell you what i did i i kicked this rock one day and i killed the the owner of the restaurant he had some ducks up there and i killed one of his ducks he said he told me i had to wash dishes i had to do this i had to do this or as he'd tell you he said well son i think he doesn't pay for that duck don't you he said yeah dad i think so he said i won't even worry about it then it's okay that happened you paid your sentence amen so i love this so this boy was going and he was leaving school that restaurant owner came out and said son get in here and watch these dishes you come in here and you you wash these dishes he said i'm not washing no dishes he said i'm gonna go tell your daddy about that duck you killed and he looked over his shoulder he said what duck are you talking about he said i'm gonna tell your daddy he said daddy already knows amen daddy already knows about it go ahead and tell him if you want to i mean i believe some of us today i mean we've been paying some sentences amen we've not been worshiping like we want to we've not had a prayer life like we wanted to we've not had this like we wanted to amen the devil's holding something over you i'd look them square in the face this morning and say devil what duck are you talking about amen what doc are you talking about he already knows about it hallelujah he already knows about it and then what doctor are you talking about what sin are you talking about amen church the sentences are over amen i'm done bargaining with the devil i'm then persuading them well i have liberty this service if i do without this service i ain't making no deals with the devil i'm telling them devil you're true you're through tell them somebody you're through even he's been having his way with you you're through hallelujah glory to god we're not yoked by any devil i mean we're not yoked by any day i tell you i love this knowing that we're actually living in satan's eden and you realize he came to christ what'd he tell him he said you bow down before me i'll give you all these kingdoms i'll give you all this jesus never denied him and said they ain't used their mind he said it's written you shall not kept the lord your god amen he didn't deny those kingdoms weren't his listen church we're here living in satan's eden i mean some of you young people here i mean you young sisters you're living and satan's eating and you're such a powerful testimony and because all of these are out here but they're they're wearing the yoke of the devil they have to do what he says do they have to go where he says go and yoke up to him the yoke up to the guard of this evil age amen they have to listen to who they're they have to listen to their taskmaster but i'm so thankful that god has got some signs god has got some daughters that we are not wearing the yoke of the enemy i know we don't have a joke on us and we're not putting that yoke on us amen this building's full of testimonies i just want to rub it into the devil for a moment and say devil look at here at some of our young brothers look at our young sisters we are here in freedom we're here in liberty hallelujah and when the only thing we're yoked to is the word the truth hallelujah yes sir i mean we're yoked the truth i tell you that's what jesus said amen said take my yoke upon you my yoke is easy my burden is light amen i'm thankful to be part of those few brother we're not yoked up by no denomination we're not yoked up by no headquarters we're not yoked up we don't have to answer to nobody is that right i mean that's what the message of the hour came to do and it came to expose that nickelodeon spirit here in the book of revelation how when god said amen i do agree with you on this you hate that nicholas spirits and i do too amen then the prophet would teach that he said you see what it is amen it means to conquer the laity so organization what do they want to do they want to control this i'll tell you i've been in a baptist church before and i've seen that they read that quarterly will you read this this and this and you can say this this and this you can worship x amount of minutes and it's so controlled it's so amen you you come to church but you got all these strings attached to it but i'm so glad that god has given us a word that we have zero strings attached to it but that we can come to the house of god we can preach the truth of this word we can worship in spirit we can worship in truth but we don't have to answer to nobody but to god almighty even though we respect our pastors and our leaders i'm not saying that i remember at the end of the day i mean we don't have to answer to nobody yeah i say this way i know we can worship god with no strings attached hallelujah i know we can worship god with no strings attached we don't have to worry about a neighbor we don't have to worry about this one we don't have to worry about this one but god wants his children to be free he wants us to be free sons and daughters of god not bound up by anything but live in total freedom hallelujah i'll find a place to pull over more clothes y'all make it hard to close hallelujah amen this word has produced a freedom with absolutely no strings attached to it at all you see satan's okay freedom of religion free to come to church free to worship god if you want to but just don't worship in spirit and in truth just don't go a step farther i ask you the question can we go that extra step let's go beyond amen i believe god wants our praise and worship don't you not i'm i'm not trying to i'm not trying to pump you up with a push up but i want to show you this power in your praise amen there's power and you worship god and freedom and in spirit and in liberty hallelujah you realize it's scriptural right amen god inhabits the praises of his people he said well brother i want a move of god this morning what do you want to start it off with worship amen he inhabits the praises of his people he might say this is the morning that we hear the signing of that trumpet and we go free and say god i've heard the trumpet sound i'm going to drop every hindrance i'm going to drop everything i'm holding on to and go free let's let's stand our feet you know that song brother i worship you mighty god i worship you almighty god there's none

you realize that maybe there's areas and avenues that you're not free when i study these things that begin to challenge my heart thinking well maybe i'm not free in my spirit maybe there's things that they've attached themselves on to me and it's been a hindrance to my worship my hindrance to my praise and maybe you're realizing that this morning that you've not been given your all there's been some things hindering you if you like to lift your hand and ask god to remove those things god remove that hindrance amen the bible says that the word of god's a sharp two-edged sword he can cut off
