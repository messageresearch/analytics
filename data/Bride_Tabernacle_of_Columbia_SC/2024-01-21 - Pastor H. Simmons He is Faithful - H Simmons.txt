something to thank God for amen book of Hebrews the 10th chapter 23rd verse Hebrews 10 and 23 let us hold fast our profession of our faith without waving for he is what you believe that he's faithful amen you can be seated he's faithful amen not only is he's faithful he's faithful that that promis you might say what did he promise that he's faithful concerning what did he promise he's faithful that promise what kind of promises did God made you and I not only did he make promises to us but he made promises Amen to those that are not of us amen but he's faithful he says here and let us consider one another to provoke unto what love and to what and good works then he says not forsaking to assemble ourselves to what together as the man of su is but exalting one another so much the more as you see the what approach the day approaching amen I believe I was thinking on the day of judgment and it just makes you made me just just how how would it be in the day of judgment when you got to stand before a judge I don't know how many of you in here ever stood before a judge uh uh maybe a traffic ticket maybe something that you went through uh and you had to stand before the judge how many you ever experienced standing before a judge okay and you stand before the judge I don't know how you felt but I was even when I was in the right just being there I remember as a little boy I went through a little incident and my mom you know she had the issue or Whata call them because somebody had mishandled me or whatever I just a little child and the judge is speaking and I was nervous just standing there before the judge and uh goes they found the man and sentencing him and all but just to stand before a judge uh in makes you feel a little you know even when you're in the right standing before a judge it's just that it it's kind of I I I kind of felt a little sensitive you know some people get stand before a judge and just I don't know but even when the judge come out he ask they ask everybody to what stand in other words you give honor for that judge amen so he said that that day is approaching it's going to become a time where you and I the Bible says is appointed to man wants to die but after that is the what judgment as you think about Judgment Day is coming Judgment Day is coming and I was thinking about that this morning as I was praying Judgment Day is coming and every time I think about that we got to give account for the things that we do when I even think about that even though we try to live a Godly life and a life that we think that God would be pleased with even in that it is it makes you understand that one day you going to have to stand before God and when you stand before God I I want to you know some of us I ain't afraid I ain't nervous I stand there and tell him how good I've been and how righteous I've been how holy I've been I I want to stand the Bible say judgment begins where in the house of God and he said if it first began at us where should a sinner in the ungodly appear are you with me so here we are amen God is Faith he is faithful that promise you and I got to appear before a a a just God and when you know that God is just and I I was in Genesis it say uh surely the god of the whole earth will do right God going to do right somebody say somebody did me wrong and the judge that many folks are in prison or many folks have went to the uh the the electric chair and died because and they were in the right I'm going to tell you God Don't Make No mist mistakes and he'll he'll judge righteous judgment are you with me but I I when you appear before God uh I want to know how will you appear before him it doesn't matter how all the the the stuff folks do and say and all the uh must I'm trying to say a word that I can't hardly pronounce so massage or whatever you know all of this huh all of this stuff people try to make it so glamorous and make it appear that everything is fine when you appear before God all of that stuff fake stuff ain't going to work all of the make believe world that we live in and try to make ourselves righteous and try to make ourselves holy and and try to justify our wrong when we know in our heart the Bible said the heart knows its own wickedness when we know ourselves to be amen that we are not doing or living what we supposed to live and doing what we know to do it right you know all of that stuff ain't going work God is faithful he's faithful that promise it doesn't matter how comfortable we might try to make ourselves feel because it doesn't matter how secure we can you know you know try to make believe that ah God going to accept when I appear before God I'm going to say I'm all right when I appear before God I know God going to say look at my child well done good and faithful servant come on in into the joy of the Lord but it's going to be a a time when you and I got to come and face reality we got to come to the point with God that we're going to face reality and we're going to actually amen stand before him and he going to give our just reward I will just reward just as a man soul that shall he reath it won't be any way out of it we can't talk our way out of it you can't lie about it you're going to stand before a just God let me try to go back here in Hebrews here in 26 verse 10 if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth what but as certain fearful the Bible says it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God of a a a certain fearful looking for of the what of judgment and fiery indignation which shall what Devour the adversaries he that despised Moses law died without what under two or three Witnesses y'all understand that the Bible said if you love me what you love him you sure you sure you love him look at somebody say you certain you love him then he says what look at him and tell he said what are you doing it are you doing it well you say I love him now remember all liars all liars where all liars going are you with me so you can't lie your way out of this you know they say I know we we not supposed to swear do you swear to tell the truth nothing but the truth are you with me judgment begin in the house of God are you telling the truth nothing but the truth so help you God don't swear the Bible says SAR not isn't that right but I'm asking you you telling the truth nothing but the truth the Bible say you should know the truth and the what truth will set you free is't that right be honest be honest with God be honest with yourself God I need some mercy I need Mercy this morning I need mercy God have mercy on my soul lord I need help so you can't get it till you recognize your condition when you recognize your condition you can repent and say God have mercy cuz one day there's going to come A Day of Reckoning a day we going to have to be accountable for the things that we done in this body that's going to come accountability we going to have to give account that's why I never wanted to be in a condition to be a preacher because I didn't want nobody blood on my hand and I got to give a account you know most people don't care what the preacher say hey preach ain't no count for me I I got a relationship me and God who want to be in the position where you got to be give account for people's Souls will you tell them what thus said the word is what thus said the Lord is and they say say who you think you are it's just like uh the police out there trying to tell you not to speed and they pull you over you told him wa who you think you are he's the police well you ain't got no jurisdiction over me are you with me and see that's the way the word of God say you broke the law you have not obeyed the truth and you said who under who's going to execute judgment who going to make me do right who's going to stop me from doing wrong for we have the little saying all have sinned and come short of the glory of God so who can judge me when we all in bad shape see we're not going to be judged by one another not merging ourselves by ourselves God going to have every man to be judged he going to look at the book this Bible is going to judge every man the preacher too every man is going to be judged by the word and what the word say is right I say he's faithful God is faithful that promise amen it said it's a a certain fear for amen the day of judgment the day under Moses law we di without Mercy under two or three Witnesses it said in 29th verse how much s punishment suppose ye 29th verse suppose ye shall shall he be thought worth wor the who has what Trot under the foot the Son of God and has counted the what blood of the Covenant they had the blood on the doost and the Linton how about the blood of Jesus the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified and what Unholy thing dancing in the church play all kind of fil inside the Church of God they say it's the Church of God got no fear of God I know they going fall but they going what they going too far ain't that right but that just shows you we said in I think in December last year this is 24 will be the time of exposure and things are already being exposed just ask cat it's being exposed Ain it right I said that which is done in the dog it'll come to the light is't that right don't worry about a thing amen your sins are find you out are you with

through well I know God love me and I love him but why am I going through see somehow you got to press your way through Lord I I want to please you I want to do the right thing but you know I have a struggle here help me Lord to do the right thing to live the way you want me to live to walk this narrow straight way I know it's straight I know it's narrow but it's the right way I want to walk it am but I need help amen I need your help Lord need your help how much Soul punishment amen who has tried under the foot the Son of God encountered the blood of the Covenant wherewith he Sanctified an Unholy thing and has done the spite to the what God has Grace on you don't make his grace disgrace amen he loves you but don't make his grace dis Grace he said what should we say then shall we continue in sin As Romans 6 said as the grace May abound he said God God forbid are you with me God forbid that you continue on Amen because it's coming this round the curve don't you see the signs of the judgment don't you see the signs of the time you can discern the face of the sky cannot you discern that we are at the end that God is coming soon sister old Jos she kept she's 90 years old we

all y'all didn't read that it is what the what one day it's going to be God's hand and it's going to be a fify thing to fall in the hand of the Living God but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were a what illuminated you remember the Happy Days when you were glad to be saved when you said Lord I love you with all my heart God I I want to live for you I want to be a Christian you all fire for God you were illuminated praise God didn't worry about what the world thought about you what people thought about you amen you even worry about nothing but Lord thank you thank you

former day in which after ye were illuminated amen you endure great what fight of afflictions you go you you want you willing to go through some stuff amen some Affliction you willing to go through we get to a point we grow up we don't want to go through nothing no more praise God God called you out of the world God save you God fill you with his Spirit but now you don't want to go through nothing Lord afflictions amen partly while you were made a what a Gaz and stock both by reproach and afflictions and partly while you became the Comm companion of them that were so used are you with me you'll be used you'll be abused and you'll be accused are you with me but that's all right that's what that's the way that we go with the Lord despise few all that live Godly in Christ Jesus are going to suffer persecution are you with me that's it's nothing that amen that we we we come on this journey and we fight this good fight of Faith amen knowing that he is faithful I'm serving a God that's

has worked it out already thank you Jesus it's been already worked out Hallelujah I got to go I got to close of some kind of way but God is second Peter said the Lord is not slight Amen Let me let me just try to do that and and and stop here but God is faithful second Peter 3 and9 amen the Lord is not slight he's faithful he's faithful to his all his promises amen he said the Lord is not slight concerning his promise as some men counts slightness but is longsuffering reason why God ain't done nothing yet man is doing all kind of wickedness but God ain't hadn't done anything yet look like because he's faithful his faithfulness is what his longsuffering not to us what not what not willing that what see God is merciful am man people spit in his face and he and he could have just but he's faithful they spit in his face brother Fred they whipped him amen they lied on him but God is faithful amen could you see how they done my law yet he's faithful he did it for you and I if he went through for you and I all that day done to him and he went through that for you and I what about you can you go through a little while for the Lord can you love him enough that he loved you so much that he went through all of that for you and I that you can love him enough to be faithful to him and hold on a little while longer hallelujah oh yes he said those under the fifth seal how long he said just a little while amen and everything going to be all right just a little while longer amen won't you hold on a little while longer praise God Amen he that's oh I get there I got to close I
