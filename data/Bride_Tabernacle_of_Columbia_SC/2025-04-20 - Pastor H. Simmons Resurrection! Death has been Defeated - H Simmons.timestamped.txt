[45:12] God, that
[45:14] you look upon the needs of your people
[45:16] this morning. Lord, Father, that you
[45:19] move flesh back out of the way, God.
[45:22] Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. that your spirit
[45:24] might have the preeminence. Yes, Lord.
[45:26] And your word might, oh God, accomplish
[45:29] that which you sent it to do. Yes, Lord.
[45:32] Lord, may you, oh God, save, heal, and
[45:35] deliver.
[45:36] Bless your children this morning. Yes,
[45:39] Lord. Meet every need. Yes, Lord. Oh,
[45:42] God. Hallelujah. Lord, thank you, Jesus.
[45:46] Thank you, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[45:49] Now Lord, we commit the word of God in
[45:52] your hand in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[45:58] The book of first Corinthians
[46:01] 15 and
[46:04] 50. We want to talk to you this morning
[46:07] concerning the resurrection.
[46:09] As is the Easter according to
[46:13] custom re the
[46:16] resurrection. We want to
[46:19] say death has been defeated.
[46:24] Thank the Lord this morning for Marcus
[46:26] and Sierra Davies. Amen.
[46:30] Glad to have y'all this morning. Amen.
[46:35] 50. It
[46:37] says, and I'll read the first, you read
[46:40] the next, and we read the latter verse
[46:42] together. Now this I say, brethren, that
[46:45] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[46:46] kingdom of God, neither does corruption
[46:50] inherit incorruption.
[46:54] 51, you shall not see, but we shall all
[46:58] be changed. In the moment, in the
[47:01] twinkling of an eye, at the L's trump,
[47:04] for the trump shall sound, and the dead
[47:06] shall be raised
[47:08] incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
[47:11] 53 For this corruptible must put on
[47:15] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[47:17] on immortality.
[47:19] So when this corruptible shall have put
[47:22] on incorruption, and this mortal shall
[47:25] have put on
[47:26] immortality, then shall be bought to
[47:29] pass the saying that is written, death
[47:31] is swallowed up in victory. 55 Oh death,
[47:35] where I s
[47:39] for the stain of death is sin, and the
[47:42] strength of sin is the law. 57 But
[47:46] thanks be to God which gives us the
[47:49] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:52] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be
[47:54] steadfast, unreovable, always abound in
[47:57] the work of the Lord. For as much as you
[47:59] know that your labor is not in vain in
[48:02] the Lord. God bless you. You may be
[48:04] seated. Amen. Amen. God is good. Amen.
[48:08] Amen.
[48:10] Now this morning I said death has been
[48:13] defeated. Amen. Amen.
[48:18] In the resurrection morning the song
[48:20] says
[48:21] when the prison bars will be broken.
[48:24] Amen.
[48:26] And we know that death is a prison. Yes.
[48:29] Amen. Amen. And death in hell was styled
[48:34] as a prison.
[48:37] And
[48:38] uh souls were in prison by death.
[48:44] And because souls were in prison by
[48:47] death,
[48:49] Amen. they couldn't get out.
[48:52] But of the resurrection of Jesus
[48:56] Christ, Amen. death was defeated. Amen.
[49:00] Amen. So we want to go to Romans 6th
[49:03] chapter here. Romans 6
[49:06] and4 just set a
[49:09] stage. Romans 6
[49:13] and4 it says uh concerning uh it it
[49:17] starts off in the in the sixth uh
[49:19] chapter said what shall we say then
[49:21] shall we continue and sin that grace may
[49:24] abound? God forbid. Amen. Now we know
[49:27] death came by sin. The Bible said in the
[49:30] uh 6 and 23 the wages of sin is death.
[49:34] Amen. So when we associate death and
[49:37] sin, they come together. Amen. Because
[49:39] the day you eat of the tree, the day you
[49:42] eat or day you touch it, you're going to
[49:44] die.
[49:45] Praise God. Amen. And we understand that
[49:50] man died spiritually the day he ate.
[49:57] Because Methuselah lived 969 years and
[50:01] he died. The Bible said one day is with
[50:04] the Lord is as a thousand years. Amen.
[50:07] So the day he ate, the day he died.
[50:11] Amen.
[50:13] Spiritually, death fed in.
[50:16] The day you don't
[50:19] eat of the tree of life, you die.
[50:23] Are you with me? Amen. You have a an
[50:27] invitation to eat of the tree of life.
[50:31] And the day you don't eat it, you die.
[50:35] Are you with me? Amen.
[50:39] God has made it possible that you don't
[50:42] have to die. Amen. Amen. So in the sixth
[50:45] verse he says wait
[50:49] Caleb therefore we are buried with him
[50:52] by baptism into death that like as
[50:55] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[50:57] the glory of the father even so we also
[51:02] should walk in what? Newness of life.
[51:04] Newness of life. You know I I wouldn't
[51:07] sat around and be dead just because I
[51:09] want to be dead.
[51:14] Death, Amen, has it sting to it. Amen.
[51:19] Death has its corruptible ways to it.
[51:22] That's right. But he said, I I want you
[51:25] to I behold I show you a mystery. We
[51:28] shall not all sleep. Amen. Amen. But we
[51:31] shall be changed. Yes, I believe that
[51:35] not only as it talks about an event
[51:38] called the
[51:39] resurrection, it also talks about a
[51:42] person who is the resurrection. Amen.
[51:45] For Jesus said, I am Amen. the
