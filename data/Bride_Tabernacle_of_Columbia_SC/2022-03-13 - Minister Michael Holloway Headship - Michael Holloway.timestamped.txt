[28:05] praise the lord church
[28:07] amen how many have you been in the house
[28:08] lord let's go lord hang clap
[28:14] amen appreciate the opportunity to
[28:17] be here with you again fellowship this
[28:18] morning
[28:20] amen we're going to kind of continue on
[28:21] a similar line of thought
[28:23] we started on friday night for god's
[28:25] grace
[28:26] i pray it'll be a help to each one of us
[28:29] present myself included
[28:32] amen amen i'm invite you if you have
[28:34] your bibles determine the book of
[28:35] colossians
[28:37] chapter 1
[28:39] verse 12.
[28:42] colossians chapter 1 verse 12.
[28:50] the other night i was just kind of
[28:51] laying a little bit of a foundation
[28:53] thought to recognize that god has been
[28:54] so gracious to us in this age
[28:57] to bring us back to the
[28:58] the true word of god
[29:00] there's a lot of presumptions about what
[29:03] this bible means and what this book
[29:04] means and
[29:05] why god wrote it the way he wrote it but
[29:07] in this last day we've been
[29:09] told that god has opened up the seven
[29:10] seals to make known us the hidden
[29:12] mysteries of this book
[29:14] and now we see it a little bit
[29:16] differently we see it differently than
[29:17] we were taught by parents we see it
[29:19] differently than we thought for our own
[29:20] selves at one point in time and
[29:22] now we got a vindicated message to let
[29:23] us know exactly what this book is all
[29:25] about so so
[29:28] friday night we were just dealing with
[29:29] the fact that we've been brought back
[29:30] and restored back to that word
[29:32] and so we can look at things not based
[29:34] upon what we see them to be
[29:36] but what god had for ordained and told
[29:38] us they would be and as we're watching
[29:41] these events unfold we see exactly the
[29:43] word of god coming to pass in front of
[29:45] our eyes and so this morning i want to
[29:47] deal with a little bit different aspect
[29:48] of the night i was dealing more in terms
[29:50] of us seeing the world condition now i
[29:52] want to deal with it and seeing our
[29:53] condition
[29:54] let's look at colossians chapter 1 verse
[29:56] 12 before we do let's bow our heads for
[29:58] a word of prayer dear heavenly father
[29:59] lord we want to thank you for your grace
[30:01] this morning
[30:02] thank you for your favor
[30:05] lord thank you and we ask once again
[30:06] your forgiveness of sins
[30:09] lord as we yield ourselves to you this
[30:10] morning
[30:12] lord we just want to step aside
[30:15] i just want to use i yield i give to you
[30:17] lord you created it you placed it in us
[30:19] you ordained it
[30:20] god i just ask that you give us favor
[30:22] this morning lord may you use it
[30:24] lord speak to the hearts of those
[30:25] present
[30:27] let me put aside my own thoughts and
[30:28] previous ideas
[30:30] god made the holy spirit now have
[30:31] liberty to speak
[30:33] according to your divine will
[30:35] may the word be received
[30:37] lord may it bring forth according to
[30:38] what it is to do
[30:40] we act in jesus christ's name
[30:42] amen
[30:44] colossians chapter 1 verse 12
[30:47] says giving thanks unto the father which
[30:49] has made us meek to be partakers of the
[30:51] inheritance of the saints in light
[30:54] who has delivered us from the power of
[30:55] darkness
[30:56] and has translated us into the kingdom
[30:58] of his dear son
[31:00] in whom we have redemption through his
[31:02] blood even the forgiveness of sin who
[31:05] was the image of the invisible god
[31:08] the firstborn of every creature for by
[31:10] him were all things created
[31:12] that are in heaven and that are on earth
[31:14] even visible and invisible
[31:16] whether it be thrones or dominions or
[31:18] principalities or powers all things were
[31:19] made all things were created by him
[31:22] and for him now i want you to notice all
[31:24] things created have a purpose for which
[31:26] they were created
[31:27] they weren't just created to be created
[31:29] for naught they had a purpose but he had
[31:32] a reason for why he created what he
[31:34] created and why he created it that way
[31:36] let's keep reading
[31:38] and he is before all things and by him
[31:40] all things consists and that word
[31:41] consists there means have his position
[31:43] so he created all things for a purpose
[31:45] and everything he created has a position
[31:47] has a reason why it was put where it was
[31:49] placed
[31:50] and he is the head of the body and i
[31:52] notice when he starts to talk about his
[31:53] position
[31:54] he is the head of the body
[31:56] the church
[31:58] who is the beginning of the firstborn
[31:59] from the dead that in all things he
[32:02] might have preeminence
[32:03] for it please the father that in him
[32:05] should all fullness dwell and having
[32:07] made peace through the blood of his
[32:09] cross by him to reconcile listen all
[32:12] things unto himself by him i say whether
[32:15] there be things in earth
[32:16] or things in heaven this is by our heads
[32:19] dear heavenly father
[32:21] lord i want to give you thanks for your
[32:22] grace and for your mercy
[32:24] lord we just ask this morning that you
[32:26] help us happy to see one of us lord let
[32:28] us open our eyes to see may your holy
[32:30] spirit anoint us plainly lord that we
[32:32] might be able to recognize not only our
[32:33] living in but god more than ever lord
[32:36] may we see our place in it
[32:38] lord i commit this service into your
[32:39] hands
[32:40] ask your divine grace in jesus christ's
[32:42] name
[32:43] may you bless your bride worldwide
[32:45] whether she's gathering
[32:46] whether she's kneeling down in prayer
[32:48] whatever she might be doing lord may be
[32:50] pleasing in your sight may you speak to
[32:52] her heart wherever she might be
[32:54] in jesus christ's name amen
[32:57] may be seated
[32:58] i want to give us a title
[33:04] my thought for this morning
[33:06] is headship
[33:09] friday night we dealt with leadership
[33:11] tonight i want to deal with headship but
[33:13] it's more i want to do with headship
[33:15] and i'm using the same subtopic because
[33:16] it's the same continuation of thought
[33:19] correctly dedicated to the word
[33:21] we talked about how a person can be
[33:22] dedicated to something
[33:24] but then there's a correct way to be
[33:26] dedicated also
[33:27] so even a person might say well i'm
[33:29] dedicated to the word the pharisees were
[33:30] dedicated to the word
[33:32] but they weren't correctly dedicated to
[33:34] the word
[33:35] and when the correction came in the form
[33:37] of jesus christ
[33:38] it revealed where they were not
[33:40] correctly dedicated but instead of being
[33:42] able to change a line up with the word
[33:44] that was being revealed something in
[33:46] them
[33:47] constrained them to want to hold to
[33:49] their previous ideas or concepts so you
[33:51] follow me so when god sends his word he
[33:54] sends his word and vindicates that word
[33:55] he sins for a reason because he's trying
[33:57] to change our mind from where we once
[34:00] saw things that we might see things the
[34:02] way god sees things because the bible
[34:04] says that my thoughts are not your
[34:05] thoughts my way is not your way said the
[34:07] lord because the way that he sees things
[34:09] is quite different than what we see as
[34:10] man so we actually need somebody to help
[34:13] us to get in line in the right way and
[34:15] in order to get in line the right way
[34:17] that's what i want to deal with this
[34:18] morning is headship we got to have
[34:20] somebody that has a higher position or a
[34:21] higher authority that has the right to
[34:24] make a decision to say i think you
[34:25] should go this way or i think you should
[34:27] go that way and in order to be able to
[34:29] do that you got to be willing to come
[34:31] under that kind of authority and that
[34:32] authority is called headship
[34:35] headship is a form of leadership
[34:37] it's a leadership that's determined by
[34:39] position
[34:41] not necessarily the person is smarter
[34:44] not necessarily the person is stronger
[34:45] are you following me but headship is a
[34:47] position
[34:48] and it's a position that comes by god's
[34:50] divine order and if you look at first
[34:52] corinthians chapter 11 i'd like to read
[34:54] to you from the scriptures what that
[34:56] divine order is watch god's divine order
[34:58] of headship
[34:59] paul says first corinthians chapter 11
[35:01] verse 3 he said i would i would have you
[35:04] know
[35:06] that the head of every man listen is
[35:08] christ so the first order of headship we
[35:11] have to understand is man is created and
[35:13] man comes under the headship of what
[35:15] christ who is christ christ is the word
[35:18] and the head of the woman listen is the
[35:20] man so now the headship is texas is
[35:24] condescending we've got christ is one
[35:26] order over man now we've got the man
[35:28] over the woman but watch this and the
[35:30] head of christ is god
[35:32] so even jesus christ himself guess what
[35:35] he had a headship christ came to earth
[35:37] as a man but he didn't come to a man
[35:39] that the earth did it wasn't a man that
[35:41] came to earth that could do what he
[35:42] wanted to do he was a man that came to
[35:44] earth for a purpose and he had to
[35:46] fulfill the purpose of one to send him
[35:48] to earth or you follow me so the woman
[35:50] was given to the man for a purpose and
[35:52] christ was given to god for a purpose
[35:54] christ was god's body for god to use and
[35:57] man is christ's body for christ to use
[35:59] and the woman is the woman's body for
[36:01] the man to use for what for the purpose
[36:03] according to paul said for childbearing
[36:05] because that's the purpose for which she
[36:07] was given to man god created man to
[36:09] bring forth sons and daughters of god
[36:11] but man couldn't do it alone so he gave
[36:13] him a health meet in order for that
[36:15] woman to guess what be a part of that
[36:17] man and the purpose for which god
[36:19] created while you follow me so there's
[36:21] an order of headship and this headship
[36:23] comes from scripture and the scripture
[36:25] is for the purpose of fulfilling the
[36:27] program of god brother brandon said in
[36:29] the spoken word's original seed he said
[36:31] god's vision for this earth was to have
[36:33] a world filled with sons and daughters
[36:36] of god or you follow me and so there was
[36:38] a provided way that god had to fill this
[36:41] earth and that provided a way came in
[36:43] garden of genesis when god told adam to
[36:45] multiply and replenish to earth turn
[36:47] that with me for a minute i'd like to
[36:48] read that to you
[36:50] genesis
[36:51] chapter
[36:53] genesis chapter
[36:54] 1.
[36:56] let's read that in the scripture
[37:00] genesis chapter 1 verse 25
[37:04] god had a vision
[37:06] and his vision was to have an earth full
[37:08] of sons and daughters and these sons and
[37:10] daughters guess what we're going to be
[37:12] like him
[37:13] and who is he he is the word watch what
[37:16] it says in genesis 1 25 and god made the
[37:19] beast of the earth after his kind and
[37:21] the cattle after their kind and
[37:22] everything that creepeth upon the earth
[37:24] after this kind and god saw that it was
[37:26] good
[37:27] and god said let us make man in our
[37:29] image and after our likeness and let
[37:32] them have dominion over the fish of the
[37:33] sea and over the fall of the air and
[37:35] over and over over the cattle over all
[37:38] the earth and over every creeping thing
[37:40] that creepeth upon the earth so god
[37:42] created man in his own image and the
[37:44] image of god created him male and female
[37:46] created them now i want you to notice
[37:48] this even though god was making this man
[37:50] in which god was going to be head over
[37:51] the man this man was given supreme
[37:54] complete authority over the earth in
[37:56] which he was placed under over or you
[37:58] follow me brother branham described it
[38:00] like this he said man on earth was an
[38:02] amateur god whatever that man said he
[38:05] could speak he named the animals he
[38:07] could speak to the wind he could speak
[38:08] to the creation he could tell the wind
[38:10] which way to blow adam had complete
[38:12] complete supreme authority on earth but
[38:15] get this even though he had full
[38:17] authority he was still under a headship
[38:21] that authority was not to be used for
[38:23] adam to do what adam wanted to do that
[38:25] authority was to be used by the one that
[38:27] gave him authority and it was to do what
[38:29] god wanted to do or you follow me so i
[38:31] want you to watch this watch verse 28
[38:33] and god blessed them and god created
[38:35] them and said be fruitful and multiply
[38:37] listen and replenish the earth and
[38:39] subdue it so right here we see god
[38:42] giving adam the commission i want you to
[38:43] bring forth not just one son you're one
[38:46] son of god i want you to fill a whole
[38:48] earth with sons and daughters of god
[38:50] just like you i created you by my word
[38:53] to live by my word and i want an earth
[38:55] full of sons and daughters of god that
[38:57] are everyone living by the word of god
[38:59] because the word of god is a thing that
[39:01] places everything and has headship over
[39:03] all things or you follow me so god
[39:05] created man for that purpose to
[39:07] replenish to earth but watch what man
[39:10] did he say repentance earth and subdue
[39:12] it and have dominion on the fish of the
[39:13] sea and over the following air and over
[39:15] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[39:17] the earth so adam has supreme power over
[39:19] the earth yet with all this authority i
[39:22] want to point out god still had one that
[39:24] was high to him and that was the god
[39:26] that placed them there because god had
[39:28] placed them there for a purpose
[39:31] now adam didn't know all things
[39:33] god placed adam on earth and all adam
[39:35] knew was he had a commission and his
[39:37] commission was to subdue the earth and
[39:39] bring forth sons and daughters of god
[39:40] but in the back part of god's mind god
[39:42] had the whole plan laid out from genesis
[39:45] to revelations he knew exactly what was
[39:47] to take place and all adam was to do was
[39:49] to walk by faith in the word as god
[39:52] revealed the word and the thing that god
[39:54] gave adam and first thing in genesis was
[39:56] don't eat of that tree that was the
[39:58] first part of the word that was revealed
[40:00] to adam and adam failed to keep even the
[40:02] very first part of the word that came
[40:04] forth from god in order for adam to be a
[40:07] real son
[40:08] he had to be willing listen to come
[40:11] under the headship of the father you've
[40:13] given me all this all this is under my
[40:16] control but lord what do you want me to
[40:18] do with it
[40:20] lord you give me my life you give me my
[40:22] strength lord it's mine but what do you
[40:25] want me to do with it are you following
[40:27] me god gives us these things but he
[40:29] gives them to you for a purpose brother
[40:31] mike i've given you a gift to preach
[40:32] lord thank you for the gift but lord
[40:34] what do you want me to do with it are
[40:36] you following me i'm giving you brother
[40:38] uh brother gordon they get to sing but
[40:40] lord what do you want me to do with it
[40:42] he could have took that voice and maybe
[40:43] he could have cut a record for hollywood
[40:45] and made millions of dollars we don't
[40:46] know but he choose to use it in his
[40:48] pulpit what to sing praises unto the
[40:50] glory of god he gives you something but
[40:52] you have to ask him father what do you
[40:55] want me to do with it that's identifying
[40:56] your willingness to come under his
[40:58] headship
[40:59] it's yours but what does he want done
[41:01] with it adam had the world under control
[41:04] but the question was what was he going
[41:06] to do with it now let's watch this let's
[41:08] go on down a little further let's go to
[41:10] genesis chapter 2.
[41:11] and watch where adam made his mistake
[41:14] he had everything under control
[41:17] but he forfeited it
[41:18] watch genesis 2 15
[41:21] and lord god took the man and put him in
[41:23] the garden of eden address it and to
[41:25] keep it and the lord god commanded a man
[41:27] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[41:29] may freely eat
[41:31] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[41:32] evil thou shall not eat thereof eat of
[41:35] it for the day thou eateth thereof thou
[41:38] shall surely die
[41:40] there's a reward
[41:43] to headship
[41:45] but there's also a penalty
[41:47] for disobeying headship
[41:50] we find adam was the first son of god
[41:53] and the natural type the bible said
[41:55] sparta rod
[41:57] spoiled a child what god is saying god
[41:59] is not saying abuse a child he's saying
[42:02] this but a child needs to have guidance
[42:04] he needs to have headship he needs to
[42:05] have somebody to train him what's the
[42:08] right way to do things and rest the
[42:09] wrong way to do things and what god was
[42:11] doing god gave adam the word said adam
[42:14] this is the right way to do things if
[42:16] you're going to replenish to earth
[42:17] you've got to do it my way and the first
[42:19] rule in the garden is don't touch that
[42:21] tree
[42:22] don't touch that tree but i want you to
[42:25] watch this look at genesis let's turn
[42:26] over to chapter chapter uh
[42:29] uh three and i want to read to you what
[42:31] happens when man disobeyed that
[42:34] scripture that word that god laid out in
[42:36] genesis because in ephesians chapter six
[42:38] it says this
[42:39] children obey your parents in the lord
[42:42] for this is right
[42:44] honor thy father and mother listen which
[42:47] is the first commandment with promise
[42:48] that it may be well with thee and thou
[42:51] may have lived long upon the earth see
[42:53] when children come under headship god is
[42:55] saying this there's a reward for being
[42:57] headship but the same way there's a
[42:59] reward for being headship guess what
[43:01] there is a penalty for disobeying
[43:03] headship when a child disobeys their
[43:05] parents it's their parents
[43:06] responsibility to say child get back in
[43:09] line don't spoil the rock get back in
[43:11] line why you're not doing it because
[43:12] you're mad at a child brother brown say
[43:14] you're doing it because you love the
[43:16] child and you want to make sure that
[43:17] child learns the right way to walk in
[43:19] life so what god does by his word is he
[43:22] chases us not to put us under law but to
[43:25] begin to teach us what's the right way
[43:27] to work in life in other words if i put
[43:29] you here for my purpose don't you want
[43:31] to know what that purpose is if i put
[43:34] you here to fulfill my will don't you
[43:35] want to know what that will is so
[43:37] incumbent the headship is not as coming
[43:39] under a law but there's a heart that
[43:41] desires lord i want to know what your
[43:43] will is so jesus put it this way if you
[43:46] love me then seek my headship and keep
[43:49] my commandments if you love me and ask
[43:51] i'll tell you what i put you here for i
[43:53] reveal to you why you're here that you
[43:55] might live upon this earth and your days
[43:57] might be long to fulfill the will of god
[44:00] let me keep going
[44:01] now why is genesis here why is genesis
[44:04] genesis chapter
[44:06] 2 verse 15.
[44:09] and the lord god took the man and put
[44:11] him in the garden address it and to keep
[44:13] it
[44:14] and the lord god commanded a man saying
[44:15] of every tree of the garden thou may
[44:17] freely eat
[44:18] but the tree of knowledge of good and
[44:19] evil thou shalt not eat thereof
[44:21] eat of it for the day thou heat the rail
[44:23] now to surely die
[44:25] now watch chapter 3
[44:27] chapter 3 verse 9.
[44:30] and the lord god called him to adam now
[44:32] this is his son now remember my tyler's
[44:35] headship
[44:37] i'm just going over some scriptures like
[44:38] some foundation to show you where
[44:40] headship came from
[44:42] it first began in the eden
[44:45] headship of father over son
[44:48] didn't start in deuteronomy
[44:51] headship of father of a son
[44:53] started in genesis
[44:55] when god created his first son he put
[44:57] him there for a purpose and god was
[44:59] dealing with his son he gave him
[45:00] authority but brother brown said power
[45:02] what without characters what satanic
[45:05] this first son actually compromised on
[45:07] what god gave him or you follow me for
[45:09] the desire of his wife which was a very
[45:12] good desire but that desire for his wife
[45:14] caused him to compromise on what god
[45:16] gave him and the position god had put
[45:18] him in so adam compromised on the word
[45:21] on behalf of his wife now watch what god
[45:23] says here in genesis 3 9 and the lord
[45:25] god called unto adam and said unto him
[45:28] where art thou and he said i heard the
[45:30] voice in the garden and i was afraid
[45:32] because i was naked and i hid myself and
[45:34] he said who told thee that i was naked
[45:37] had thou eaten of the tree well i
[45:38] commanded that thou shall not eat
[45:40] thereof and the man said the one whom
[45:42] thou givet to be with me she gave me of
[45:44] the treat and i did eat adam made his
[45:47] first mistake brother brown said when he
[45:49] hearken to the voice of his wife over
[45:51] listen the word of god
[45:53] we're never to leave the word of god for
[45:56] anything whatever the word says we stay
[45:59] with that the bible says children obey
[46:01] your parents how in the lord why
[46:03] according to the word wives obey your
[46:05] husband how in the lord according to the
[46:08] word even though there's a handship over
[46:10] you your headship line stops when they
[46:12] go outside the word so adam had an
[46:14] obligation to take care of his wife but
[46:16] whenever she left the word that
[46:18] obligation should have stopped or you
[46:19] follow me but he went beyond the word in
[46:21] order to please his wife and that's
[46:23] where the church makes stuff when people
[46:25] try to please the church when they try
[46:27] to please a ministry when they try to
[46:28] please each other and they go outside
[46:30] the word to do that we'll never do that
[46:32] because the word is the headship above
[46:34] all things the bible said obey them they
[46:36] have rule over you what who has spoken
[46:39] unto you the word of god even when it
[46:41] comes to the ministry if a ministry ever
[46:43] leaves you or anything outside of the
[46:45] word you're no longer obligated to that
[46:46] ministry
[46:47] the bride is obligated to one thing
[46:50] that's her headship and her headship is
[46:52] christ
[46:54] now i want you to watch this genesis 3
[46:56] 17
[46:57] and adam said because thou has hearken
[47:01] and unto adam excuse me god said
[47:03] because thou was hearken to the voice of
[47:04] thy wife
[47:05] and has eaten the tree which i commanded
[47:07] he's saying thou shall not eat thereof
[47:09] or eat of it curses the ground for thy
[47:11] sake and sorrow thou shalt eat all the
[47:13] days of thy life
[47:15] thorns also and thistle shall bring
[47:17] forth to thee
[47:18] and thou shall eat of the herb of the
[47:20] field and in the sweat of thou
[47:22] and in the sweat of thy face thou shall
[47:25] leave bread till thou return
[47:27] unto the ground for out of it thou was
[47:29] taken
[47:30] thus thou art
[47:31] another dust thou shall return
[47:34] that was not god's original praying
[47:36] amen adam was never to return to the
[47:38] dust
[47:39] adam was to live eternally in the form
[47:42] in which god had created him
[47:43] so because man fell in his form god had
[47:46] to provide another way to bring man out
[47:49] of that condition where man can live on
[47:51] the earth eternally or you follow me
[47:54] now that brings us now to the second
[47:56] adam
[47:57] the second adam was christ
[47:59] just as the first adam had dominion over
[48:01] all the earth and with all his power he
[48:03] had he still had to come under headship
[48:05] we find that when the second adam came
[48:07] jesus christ guess what he still had to
[48:10] come under the same
[48:12] headship
[48:13] jesus christ as the second adam had to
[48:15] prove that god was able to achieve in
[48:17] man what the first animal failed to do
[48:19] he had a man that didn't live by part of
[48:21] the word but he finally had a man that
[48:23] would live by every word that proceedeth
[48:26] out of the mouth of god this man christ
[48:28] came back under the headship of god let
[48:30] me keep on reading let me keep on
[48:32] reading
[48:34] first corinthians chapter 15 verse 44
[48:36] still laying the foundation
[48:39] first corinthians 15 44.
[48:42] the bible says it was sown a natural
[48:44] body
[48:45] it has raised a spiritual body
[48:48] there is a natural body and there is a
[48:50] spiritual body
[48:52] and so is it written the first man adam
[48:54] was made a living soul listen
[48:57] but the last adam was made a quickening
[49:00] spirit
[49:02] christ came as the second adam
[49:05] the first adam was a
[49:08] spoken word creation by god
[49:11] then the second adam was the same
[49:14] thing
[49:15] he was a spoken word creation of god
[49:18] but when god took that spoken word of
[49:20] creation and put that word in the body
[49:22] in the book of genesis in that body man
[49:24] was given what was called free moral
[49:26] agency as long as he was a spirit he
[49:29] could only live as he was and that was
[49:31] spirit but the bible said when god put
[49:33] him in a body of flesh then he became a
[49:35] living soul brother brown said what is
[49:37] the soul your soul is your ability to
[49:39] choose he said why do you have the
[49:41] ability to build a house why can man
[49:42] build a car he said the animals never
[49:44] build cars they never build houses why
[49:46] he said they only stay in the order in
[49:48] which god gave them the beginning why he
[49:50] said they have no soul they have no
[49:52] ability to choose they can't think like
[49:54] you think they have instinct that leads
[49:56] them here and leaves them there but they
[49:58] had no soul to make a choice god gave
[50:00] you a soul why he wanted man to have the
[50:03] ability to make a choice god wanted
[50:06] headship but he wanted to be your choice
[50:08] listen to live under that headship
[50:12] is not looking for a people that he's
[50:13] gonna beat and bruise and bind to do his
[50:15] will god wants the people that loves him
[50:18] the way he loves them and they want to
[50:20] do his will you'll make your mistakes
[50:22] you'll do things wrong but when god
[50:24] convicts you that you say lord i'm sorry
[50:26] for what i've done wrong
[50:29] but in this headship it's based upon two
[50:32] points there's one that has the
[50:33] authority but there has to be one that's
[50:35] willing to submit listen unto that
[50:38] authority i want you to watch this
[50:42] it has sown a natural body
[50:44] it has raised a spiritual body so
[50:46] there's a natural body in the spiritual
[50:47] body as it is written the first man adam
[50:50] was made a living soul the second adam
[50:52] was made a quickening spirit that second
[50:54] adam came
[50:56] to fulfill what the first adam failed to
[50:58] do amen
[51:00] adam failed to fulfill listen the
[51:03] perfect will of god amen
[51:06] adam had sons and daughters
[51:09] but they were not in god's image
[51:11] adam had children that feel the earth
[51:14] but they were not in god's image god
[51:16] wanted sons and daughters of god that
[51:18] would just like his image and what was
[51:22] his image that was the word now watch
[51:24] this second adam when he comes to earth
[51:26] watch the mind that this second adam has
[51:29] hebrews chapter 10 verse 1.
[51:31] hebrews chapter 10 verse 1. i'm talking
[51:33] about headship
[51:36] god created adam for a purpose
[51:39] adam broke that purpose
[51:41] so god created his second adam christ
[51:44] and christ had just as much purpose for
[51:47] coming as the first adam did
[51:49] but watch christ's mind when he came to
[51:51] earth hebrews 10 verse 1
[51:54] for the law having the shadow of good
[51:56] things to come
[51:57] and not the very image of the things
[52:00] can never with those sacrifices listen
[52:03] which they offer year by year
[52:04] continually make the comet of their own
[52:06] two perfect
[52:07] god was the one that established
[52:09] sacrifice
[52:10] but paul is saying this but that was not
[52:12] god's perfect will god never really
[52:14] wanted us to be in sin to begin with and
[52:16] when man sin animal blood because it had
[52:19] no soul could never help man out are you
[52:21] following me but watch what the word
[52:22] says
[52:24] for then what they have not ceased to be
[52:26] offered because the words for one's
[52:27] prayer should have no more conscious of
[52:29] sin
[52:30] but in those sacrifices there is
[52:31] remembrance again made of sins year
[52:34] after year listen
[52:35] for it is not possible that the blood of
[52:37] bulls and goats should take away sins
[52:39] therefore when he cometh into the world
[52:41] now he's talking about christ now when
[52:43] christ come into the world he said
[52:46] watch his revelation
[52:48] as a son under full obedience he knows
[52:51] why he's there
[52:53] adam in the garden knew why he was there
[52:57] are you follow me in order to be
[52:59] obedient to headship you got to know the
[53:02] vision of the headship
[53:04] why does god want man to be ahead of his
[53:06] household brother brown said that man
[53:07] should have a vision for how he wants
[53:09] that house to operate before he chooses
[53:11] a wife he should have a vision what kind
[53:13] of home do i want what kind of
[53:14] atmosphere do i want what kind of
[53:16] children do i want and he chooses a
[53:18] woman to help fulfill that vision
[53:20] or you follow me and so when god gave
[53:23] adam eve he gave him the right kind of
[53:25] woman to fulfill the vision but the
[53:27] woman got off the word and that broke
[53:29] the vision and then adam got off the
[53:30] word and then all things fall on the
[53:33] scene are you following me but when
[53:34] christ came he came with the revelation
[53:37] he knew that sacrifice of animals was
[53:40] not satisfying to god so when he came
[53:42] with this revelation what was it my
[53:44] purpose of coming is to be the correct
[53:47] sacrifice because i'm the one that's
[53:48] going to provide god what he's been
[53:50] looking for ever since the fall in the
[53:52] garden
[53:54] he knew what his coming was for
[53:56] and he knew that god sent it for a
[53:58] reason and he was determined to be
[54:00] obedient to that headship until he
[54:02] fulfilled the purpose in which he came
[54:05] i pray god raises up a bride today that
[54:08] has the revelation of why were you put
[54:10] here and you determine your heart i'm
[54:12] going to fulfill the reason i was put
[54:14] here
[54:16] now watch adam
[54:18] the second adam
[54:20] and bern offers the sacrifice for sin
[54:22] thou has no pleasure then he said i this
[54:24] is christ lo i come in the volume of the
[54:27] book it is written of me to do thy will
[54:30] o lord watch this
[54:31] he knew that the way to find out the
[54:34] mind of god
[54:35] the will of god it was already written
[54:37] in the book
[54:40] so when christ came to fulfill god's
[54:41] will it wasn't where is the will or what
[54:44] is the will he knew it was in the book
[54:46] but the only way to know his part in the
[54:48] book was he can only do it as god
[54:50] revealed it i do nothing until the
[54:53] father shows me what first
[54:56] every step of the righteous must be
[54:58] ordered by the lord or you follow me
[55:01] that's our headship
[55:03] so christ came the bible said as the
[55:05] fullness of god had bodily yet being the
[55:08] fullness of god he still had to bring
[55:10] all that power
[55:11] under headship
[55:14] are you following me watch his mind said
[55:16] then like come in the volume of the book
[55:18] it is written on me to do thy will oh
[55:19] god
[55:20] above he's saying sacrifice and offers
[55:23] and burning officers for sins thou would
[55:24] have no have no pleasure therein
[55:27] which are offered by the law
[55:30] then said he christ lo i come to do thy
[55:33] will o god so he taketh away the first
[55:36] that he might establish the second by
[55:38] the which will listen we are sanctified
[55:41] through the offering of the body of
[55:43] jesus christ once
[55:46] and for all
[55:48] now i want you to see what's happening
[55:49] here
[55:50] headship is now shifting
[55:53] god placed the first headship
[55:55] under adam
[55:57] multiply and replenish to earth
[55:59] and subdue it
[56:01] then god took from adam a wife listen
[56:05] and place her in a garden
[56:07] now this wife
[56:08] actually has an authority
[56:10] her job now is adam was god's agency
[56:13] upon earth to fulfill the word now the
[56:15] woman listen comes forth from the man as
[56:19] his agency
[56:21] to fulfill the word so now eve has to
[56:23] obey the same word that adam had to obey
[56:26] because the two are going to be one to
[56:28] fulfill the same commission
[56:31] what's the commission to fill the earth
[56:33] with sons and daughters of god
[56:36] so when christ came he fulfilled the
[56:38] first half of the crown what did he do
[56:40] he offered his blood to sanctify church
[56:43] now by that blood he's redeemed himself
[56:45] to a church the same way that first adam
[56:48] had an eve now the second adam guess
[56:50] what he's got now there's a second eve
[56:53] there's a woman on earth that was
[56:55] pre-ordestinated from the bosom of god
[56:58] to come forth out of christ for what
[56:59] purpose to bring forth more sons and
[57:02] daughters of god and on the day of
[57:04] pentecost what did she birth she brought
[57:06] broken
[57:07] sons and daughters of god so full of
[57:09] power they were speaking in unknown
[57:11] tongues
[57:13] so full of the power of god their shadow
[57:16] heal the sick
[57:17] that was god's image of sons and
[57:19] daughters of god upon the earth
[57:22] but he had to have a bride
[57:24] that would same way that adam was
[57:26] obedient to god the second animal was
[57:28] obedient to god now there's got to be a
[57:30] bride that's a beating to her handship
[57:32] which is christ
[57:37] now we're not talking about the son of
[57:39] god so much
[57:41] the son represented adam he fulfilled
[57:43] his part now there's a bride coming
[57:47] but the bride as the son was under
[57:49] headship so is the woman under headship
[57:52] as the man was under headship so must
[57:55] the woman be under headship and when the
[57:57] church misses the revelation they just
[57:59] see scriptures about adam and eve and
[58:01] about bone of my bone and flesh my flesh
[58:03] but what he said is you have to be what
[58:05] i am
[58:06] in order for us to be won
[58:10] so in order for the church of christ to
[58:12] be won she's got to be bold of his bone
[58:14] flesh of his flesh word of his word what
[58:17] he is she must become
[58:20] and she don't know what that is and the
[58:22] only way she can do it is by headship as
[58:24] he leads her into his word she sees what
[58:27] god has put her here for
[58:29] amen
[58:32] god brought luther out of catholicism
[58:35] because catholicism was wrong
[58:37] and luther fulfilled the word of god
[58:40] but when wesley came
[58:42] god wasn't calling him to be a lutheran
[58:46] he had to depend upon the mind of god
[58:49] to show him what's the word
[58:51] for your age
[58:54] wesley got so bogged down
[58:57] his ideas of what the church was all
[58:59] about
[59:00] that they formed an organization called
[59:02] a methodist church
[59:03] and brother bram said god moved out of
[59:05] that
[59:06] but then god raised up a new group of
[59:07] sons listen that was willing to take his
[59:10] word and fulfill
[59:12] pentecost all over again with the
[59:14] outpouring of pentecost of the baptism
[59:16] of the holy ghost brother brown said
[59:18] that was another work of grace god was
[59:21] fulfilling in his bride she wasn't
[59:23] dependent upon what the church said the
[59:25] church should be she was finding the
[59:27] mind of god for her age
[59:30] because you see headship deals with the
[59:31] mind what's in the mind the ability to
[59:34] make decisions
[59:35] so when you come under another man's
[59:37] headship what you're saying is his
[59:39] headship or his decision is greater than
[59:41] my decision i might have my ideas but
[59:44] i'll surrender my ideas to the one
[59:45] that's greater than i am or you follow
[59:47] me i want you to see what jesus christ
[59:49] said even though he was the fullness of
[59:51] the godhead bodily watch what christ
[59:53] said about his own self in saint john
[59:56] 14 28
[59:58] he said ye have heard how i said unto
[1:00:00] you i go away and come again unto you
[1:00:02] if you love me you rejoice because i
[1:00:04] said i go unto the father for the father
[1:00:07] listen is greater than i
[1:00:09] i thought it was the fullness of the
[1:00:10] godhead bodily he was
[1:00:13] but listen in the form of a man
[1:00:16] i want you to get this in the form of a
[1:00:18] man
[1:00:19] all of that power of the godhead became
[1:00:22] subject to the holy ghost which was his
[1:00:24] father
[1:00:25] so the headship wasn't because god and
[1:00:28] christ were different the headship
[1:00:29] because the father was one office and
[1:00:31] the son was another office but yet the
[1:00:33] two were one
[1:00:36] brother brown said if only they would
[1:00:37] have caught that when he said i the son
[1:00:38] of man he said they didn't know they
[1:00:40] would christ the mystery he said they
[1:00:41] didn't know he was talking about what
[1:00:42] was it he was the same god only get this
[1:00:45] church come to earth in another form and
[1:00:48] in that form he made himself subject to
[1:00:50] everything you and i are subject to
[1:00:53] he could take sickness he could taste
[1:00:54] well he could taste temptation he could
[1:00:57] taste everything you and i taste yet he
[1:00:59] could do it without seeing why because
[1:01:01] he's staying under the guidance
[1:01:04] of his headship
[1:01:08] and this bride is going to be tempted in
[1:01:09] every way
[1:01:11] but how do we overcome sin
[1:01:13] by our headship amen amen
[1:01:16] don't lean to your thinking amen don't
[1:01:18] lean to your understanding
[1:01:20] but in everything listen church the
[1:01:22] bride now has the mind of christ
[1:01:25] she's following him
[1:01:27] let me give you another scripture turn
[1:01:29] the book of colossians
[1:01:30] turn the book of colossians
[1:01:33] i want you to turn it with me for a
[1:01:34] minute
[1:01:36] colossians uh
[1:01:40] no excuse me
[1:01:41] philippians
[1:01:44] philippians
[1:01:46] chapter 2
[1:01:49] philippians chapter 2.
[1:01:53] now i want you to follow me on the start
[1:01:54] for a minute
[1:01:55] because see what i'm trying to bring out
[1:01:57] to you this morning is a very simple
[1:01:58] thought
[1:01:59] headship started in garden
[1:02:02] it started
[1:02:03] with one man
[1:02:05] under god
[1:02:07] it ended up
[1:02:09] with one man still under god but not a
[1:02:12] woman under that man
[1:02:14] but when he left the garden both the man
[1:02:16] and the woman had fallen
[1:02:19] so god's plan of redemption was to bring
[1:02:21] back a son listen now that could feel
[1:02:25] what the first son of adam didn't do
[1:02:28] by obeying every word and then give that
[1:02:31] son a wife listen now that would be
[1:02:33] fully obedient to their son that their
[1:02:35] son and their wife working together by
[1:02:37] the same word to feel god's plan was to
[1:02:40] fill this earth with sons and daughters
[1:02:42] of god
[1:02:43] amen so our coming is not to be christ
[1:02:46] as a son in that body but our coming is
[1:02:49] to be the bride of christ in this body
[1:02:51] which is flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:02:53] his bone just like the first eve was
[1:02:55] you're the second eve but this evil man
[1:02:58] said it's not like that first eve you're
[1:02:59] not going to be tempted and in guay for
[1:03:01] some ism you were called and ordained to
[1:03:03] fulfill the order of true headship by
[1:03:06] full obedience to every word of god
[1:03:12] just as the husband did
[1:03:14] so must the wife do now watch this watch
[1:03:17] philippians chapter 2 verse 5.
[1:03:20] let this mind be in you
[1:03:22] which was also in christ jesus
[1:03:24] who being in the form of god
[1:03:27] thought and not robbery to be equal with
[1:03:29] god
[1:03:30] so now i want you to watch this
[1:03:32] christ's mind
[1:03:34] his thinking
[1:03:36] is to be in you
[1:03:38] how is his thinking in you
[1:03:40] by his word
[1:03:42] when you can receive his word
[1:03:44] you're receiving his thinking
[1:03:46] and his thinking is his headship you're
[1:03:49] not going by your thoughts on things
[1:03:51] you're going by what he thinks about it
[1:03:55] if you take the natural type
[1:03:57] a child
[1:03:59] might decide
[1:04:00] he wants to paint his room yellow
[1:04:03] i want a yellow bedroom
[1:04:05] he's got an allowance
[1:04:06] listen he's got an allowance maybe let's
[1:04:09] say this look let's say this little boy
[1:04:11] here does or maybe he has a hobby he
[1:04:12] makes a few dollars whatever it might be
[1:04:14] he saved up his coins
[1:04:16] it don't cost by the 30 to some dollars
[1:04:18] get a can of paint
[1:04:19] he got 30 bucks he go down to lowe's he
[1:04:22] get a can of paint
[1:04:23] and all of a sudden he goes in his room
[1:04:25] and starts painting the whole room
[1:04:26] yellow
[1:04:27] he gets paint on the carpet he gets
[1:04:29] paint on the bed but when he's finished
[1:04:31] his room is yellow
[1:04:32] then mama comes in the room
[1:04:35] she said what have you done he said mama
[1:04:37] it's my room
[1:04:38] but it's my house
[1:04:42] mama it's my room but it's my house
[1:04:45] wait the father gets home
[1:04:47] now she's taking it to a higher office
[1:04:50] husband gets home honey you're gonna see
[1:04:52] what junior did he painted room yellow
[1:04:54] and got paint everywhere
[1:04:56] then the father goes in to see if the
[1:04:58] report is correct and it is that he
[1:05:00] looks at junior said but daddy is my
[1:05:02] room daddy says the same thing mama said
[1:05:04] she's only saying well god the same
[1:05:06] thing to follow it's your room but it's
[1:05:08] our house
[1:05:09] you can you don't have you're not wrong
[1:05:12] for desiring to paint your room but you
[1:05:14] don't move
[1:05:15] in this room without giving us getting
[1:05:18] the permission of the one who owns the
[1:05:20] house
[1:05:21] god gave us this earth but we don't move
[1:05:24] on this earth without getting permission
[1:05:26] from the one who gave us this earth
[1:05:29] you see how hardship works
[1:05:31] there's nothing wrong with having a
[1:05:32] desire there's nothing wrong with having
[1:05:34] a question but you got to realize who
[1:05:36] you're under the authority of
[1:05:39] and when christ came to earth he didn't
[1:05:40] want to go to calvary he said father is
[1:05:43] another way there was no sin and desire
[1:05:45] in another way but when god said there
[1:05:47] is no way my will is the only way he
[1:05:49] said then nevertheless not my will
[1:05:52] but thy will be done if adam and eve
[1:05:54] would have done the same thing the
[1:05:56] desire wasn't wrong but it was acted on
[1:05:59] the desire without consulting with your
[1:06:01] headship
[1:06:03] if even went back to adam it had been no
[1:06:05] problem if adam would know that god that
[1:06:06] had been no problem but both acted
[1:06:08] according to their own will instead of
[1:06:10] bringing everything back to the will of
[1:06:11] god
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:15] so where we are now
[1:06:17] this world is full of denominations
[1:06:19] brother branham called them blasphemous
[1:06:21] names
[1:06:23] one called baptist one called methodist
[1:06:25] one called pentecostal one called
[1:06:26] jehovah witness what is it every church
[1:06:29] instead of being named by one name
[1:06:32] the name of christ
[1:06:34] they've taken on their own name which
[1:06:35] shows listen they're under a different
[1:06:38] headship
[1:06:43] why do we need a message
[1:06:45] to bring us out of that confusion
[1:06:48] to bring us back to one headship
[1:06:52] with one revelation
[1:06:54] with one message
[1:06:56] and that message is the mind of god
[1:06:59] and by the bride seeing that word
[1:07:01] vindicated she knows her master's voice
[1:07:05] it's the word of god vindicated in the
[1:07:07] age in which you live in noah's day he
[1:07:10] was the voice of god in that generation
[1:07:12] and his family knew if you say oh they
[1:07:14] got an art because that was their
[1:07:15] husband and that was their daddy and
[1:07:17] that was their father-in-law no sir they
[1:07:19] got in the ark because they recognized
[1:07:20] there was something different about this
[1:07:22] man his message was hard we got to build
[1:07:24] a boat for animals that don't even live
[1:07:26] in this part of the world father where
[1:07:28] are they coming from i don't know but
[1:07:29] god told me if i'll build it he said
[1:07:31] he'll bring them
[1:07:35] brother brown said he had the same
[1:07:36] problem
[1:07:37] he told his
[1:07:39] baptist church he said god ordained me
[1:07:40] with a message he said i'm going to
[1:07:42] preach around the world he said his
[1:07:43] pastor told him you had no education a
[1:07:46] seventh graders can't go preach around
[1:07:47] the world he said who's gonna listen to
[1:07:48] you he said if god gave me a message
[1:07:50] there's somebody out there that's gonna
[1:07:51] listen to it
[1:07:53] amen that's why we're here today
[1:07:55] something in you when you heard it you
[1:07:57] said that's nothing but the truth
[1:08:00] it don't mean you understand it it don't
[1:08:02] mean you can explain it but something
[1:08:03] and you recognize that's my headship
[1:08:06] that's what my heart's been hungry for
[1:08:07] that's what my life is needed i need
[1:08:10] somebody to guide me because what i
[1:08:12] don't know how to guide myself
[1:08:15] brother brown i'm saying the message of
[1:08:16] breach he said what is it he said when a
[1:08:17] man is really born again by the holy
[1:08:19] ghost he said he no longer desires his
[1:08:21] own thinking he no longer desires his
[1:08:23] own leadership and he don't want nobody
[1:08:25] to talk him into where he should go or
[1:08:26] what he should do he now is in the hand
[1:08:28] of his maker and he wants to be led by
[1:08:30] his maker wife that's his headshield
[1:08:33] the same holy ghost that led the
[1:08:34] bridegroom is the same holy ghost now
[1:08:36] leading the bride
[1:08:39] she's under a headship
[1:08:42] let me keep going
[1:08:43] philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you
[1:08:46] which is also in christ jesus
[1:08:48] what was in christ
[1:08:50] the mind of god
[1:08:52] how did the mind get there
[1:08:54] by the holy ghost
[1:08:57] i do nothing but the father
[1:09:00] shows me
[1:09:03] you see the key to this headship
[1:09:05] is not coming under rules and
[1:09:07] regulations
[1:09:08] that's called the law
[1:09:10] the key to this headship is god that
[1:09:12] created you wants to be in you and from
[1:09:15] the inside he wants to control your
[1:09:18] thinking
[1:09:21] from the inside he wants to control your
[1:09:24] thinking that's why jesus told nicodemus
[1:09:27] nicodemus you must be born again but how
[1:09:30] can i understand these things because
[1:09:31] you're not born again he is born again
[1:09:34] the only way to know the mind of god or
[1:09:36] the secret of the kingdom is first you
[1:09:38] must be born again why because god has
[1:09:40] to put his mind in you
[1:09:43] then it's no longer your thinking but
[1:09:45] now the holy ghost's in you he's doing
[1:09:47] the thinking
[1:09:49] and when you have a thought to do this
[1:09:50] something on the inside no no no no
[1:09:52] don't do that
[1:09:54] why not no no no no no we don't want to
[1:09:56] do that and if you sense it to that
[1:09:58] spirit you listen to it
[1:10:00] and it leads and guides you where into
[1:10:02] all truth
[1:10:04] but without that holy ghost you say i'm
[1:10:06] gonna try to follow this the best i can
[1:10:08] your thinking will never do it
[1:10:10] you've got to have the mind of christ
[1:10:12] literally come into you
[1:10:14] christ could have never fulfilled that
[1:10:16] part of scripture except the father was
[1:10:18] in him it's not me that do with the
[1:10:20] works but the father that dwelleth in me
[1:10:21] he's making his word live and the bride
[1:10:24] will never make this message live by
[1:10:26] trying to follow do's and don'ts it
[1:10:27] literally takes christ in you by the
[1:10:29] baptism of the holy ghost to make the
[1:10:31] world live
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:35] the holy ghost brought him under
[1:10:37] headship
[1:10:38] and the holy ghost brings the bride
[1:10:40] under headship
[1:10:42] or you follow me
[1:10:44] a new nature in you now
[1:10:46] i used to want to be this way
[1:10:48] i don't want to be that way anymore
[1:10:50] i used to want to do that
[1:10:52] listen not that i think it's a bad idea
[1:10:55] i don't even want to do it
[1:10:57] anymore amen
[1:10:59] because he has once purged
[1:11:01] have no more conscience brother that
[1:11:03] word should be desire
[1:11:05] of sin
[1:11:07] i like our brother's testimony tonight
[1:11:10] he's a young brother don't despise his
[1:11:13] youth
[1:11:14] he's got a powerful testimony
[1:11:17] what was taken from him
[1:11:18] is a work of sanctification
[1:11:21] it means to be clean and set aside
[1:11:24] man in one night can't break the habit
[1:11:26] of drugs
[1:11:27] man in one night can't drink to break
[1:11:29] the habit of alcohol
[1:11:31] man in one night don't even have the
[1:11:32] ability to make that decision
[1:11:35] but if that man makes this decision god
[1:11:37] i need you and if you will help me i'll
[1:11:40] serve you if he can make that decision
[1:11:42] god has the power to break that hole of
[1:11:44] alcohol god has that power to break that
[1:11:46] hole of drugs
[1:11:47] and the same with you and i if there's
[1:11:49] something in this world holding you back
[1:11:51] you can't break it on your own self but
[1:11:52] if you can make that decision god today
[1:11:55] i'm willing to accept your headshift if
[1:11:56] you'll show me what to do father i'll
[1:11:58] follow it all the way to the end
[1:12:03] but what's missing in the church is that
[1:12:04] dedication to headship
[1:12:07] samson had to have that dedication
[1:12:08] brother bam says samson gave god his
[1:12:10] body
[1:12:12] but he wouldn't give sam god his heart
[1:12:14] his heart he gave to the world
[1:12:16] that's laodicea
[1:12:18] they come to church with their lips and
[1:12:20] say i love you but their hearts far from
[1:12:22] me it's a lukewarm condition church i
[1:12:25] don't want to be lukewarm i want to love
[1:12:27] him with my lips i want to live with my
[1:12:28] body i'm going to live in my heart and
[1:12:30] my soul i want all that i am to be given
[1:12:32] to his headship
[1:12:34] brother brown said it's going to make
[1:12:35] you unpopular
[1:12:37] people say he's a fanatic she's a
[1:12:38] fanatic you ain't got to do all that but
[1:12:40] if you love him you'll do whatever the
[1:12:42] word asks you to do
[1:12:44] you're under a different headship
[1:12:47] you're going to look strange
[1:12:48] people say why you got to be that way
[1:12:50] because that's what he's leading me to
[1:12:52] christ the disciples told christ you're
[1:12:54] strange you ain't got to go to calvary
[1:12:56] don't lord don't don't talk like that
[1:12:58] you're talking like a foolish man but
[1:12:59] the word said he was going to calvary he
[1:13:02] had to go to carry i don't care what the
[1:13:04] disciples said
[1:13:06] paul had the same problem the holy ghost
[1:13:08] said you're going to jerusalem i mean
[1:13:10] excuse me jerome to be bound and be
[1:13:12] crucified be be be uh you're going to be
[1:13:15] decapitated
[1:13:17] that's what the dust said the lord came
[1:13:18] by against my wife correct me tonight i
[1:13:20] kept saying paul was baptized by agabus
[1:13:23] he was baptized by ananias
[1:13:26] but agaves was the one that prophesied
[1:13:29] the death he was going to take in rome
[1:13:32] and when adam was prophesied
[1:13:34] watch this
[1:13:35] the believers said not so
[1:13:38] they they had a hard time accepting
[1:13:40] the will of god
[1:13:42] they love paul
[1:13:44] they didn't want to let paul go but if
[1:13:46] god said paul is departing
[1:13:49] nothing
[1:13:50] is going to stop it
[1:13:52] or you follow me
[1:13:53] and that's when real obedience to
[1:13:55] headship comes in
[1:13:57] you love the man
[1:13:58] but now you got to let him go
[1:14:02] you follow me
[1:14:03] the bride is coming to that place
[1:14:06] abraham was so committed to headship
[1:14:08] when the thing that he loved the most
[1:14:10] was his son
[1:14:11] god said offer him
[1:14:13] as much as that troubled abraham he was
[1:14:16] willing amen to let him go
[1:14:19] you see what's missing in the church is
[1:14:20] real headship
[1:14:22] that spirit of christ in a person's
[1:14:24] heart that can really reveal to that
[1:14:26] individual not the church now this is
[1:14:28] not a group revelation
[1:14:30] reveal to the individual what is god's
[1:14:32] will concerning you
[1:14:34] at this time
[1:14:38] not by the pastor's teaching not by
[1:14:40] brother mike's teaching not by no
[1:14:42] certain not even by brother branham's
[1:14:43] teaching
[1:14:45] but the holy spirit speaking to you by
[1:14:47] his word whether it's from brother brown
[1:14:49] whether from your pastor or the front
[1:14:51] brother mike you don't hear it as a man
[1:14:53] you're hearing this god's voice speaking
[1:14:54] to you
[1:14:55] and whatever god's voice is saying to
[1:14:57] you you know the voice of your headship
[1:14:58] and you say nevertheless not my will but
[1:15:00] that will be done and you will submit to
[1:15:02] whatever it takes in order to find god's
[1:15:05] perfect will and do that perfect will
[1:15:07] because wide as that male body came to
[1:15:09] sacrifice his life to fulfill the will
[1:15:11] now the bride body was created for jesus
[1:15:13] that in christ jesus he might come in
[1:15:15] you to fulfill his will
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:18] let's turn to romans for a minute romans
[1:15:20] chapter 12. and i'm gonna try to read a
[1:15:21] couple of scriptures and let you go
[1:15:23] romans 12.
[1:15:25] i hope you're catching my point amen
[1:15:29] you see
[1:15:30] there was first a man
[1:15:32] under god
[1:15:33] then there was the woman under the man
[1:15:36] in genesis
[1:15:38] that was the natural
[1:15:40] but now we're dealing with the spiritual
[1:15:42] we've seen the man come back under god
[1:15:45] but now god is building a bride body
[1:15:47] that's also willing to come back under
[1:15:49] the man
[1:15:51] full headship
[1:15:52] as the man fulfill the word
[1:15:55] by god in the man
[1:15:57] now the bride the bride must fulfill the
[1:15:59] word by christ and the bride or you
[1:16:02] follow me
[1:16:04] chapter 12 romans 12 1.
[1:16:06] paul says i beseech you therefore
[1:16:08] brother and by the mercies of god watch
[1:16:10] this
[1:16:11] that ye present your bodies a living
[1:16:13] sacrifice
[1:16:15] as christ had to sacrifice his own
[1:16:17] desire to fulfill the word
[1:16:19] now by sacrificing our desires
[1:16:22] we fulfill the word listen
[1:16:26] a living sacrifice
[1:16:29] he sacrificed himself unto death
[1:16:33] you and i don't sacrifice ourselves so
[1:16:35] much to death
[1:16:36] you sacrifice yourself unto death to
[1:16:39] self
[1:16:40] amen the bible said he that's willing to
[1:16:42] lose his life shall find it
[1:16:45] so take up your cross
[1:16:47] daily
[1:16:49] you see the sacrifice
[1:16:51] daily and do what follow me
[1:16:54] whenever your desire says go this way
[1:16:57] and the word says go that way
[1:16:59] you sacrifice your desire in order to
[1:17:02] fulfill his desire
[1:17:03] because you come under his headship
[1:17:06] it don't mean y'all always going to
[1:17:08] agree
[1:17:09] christ and god didn't always agree
[1:17:11] but christ was willing to put aside his
[1:17:14] own thinking that he might agree with
[1:17:16] the decision of the father
[1:17:17] i could imagine listen to our church
[1:17:19] when christ was on earth and he was
[1:17:21] sitting there in that city i believe i
[1:17:22] forgot what city was in and here was
[1:17:24] lazarus was sick and they said word of
[1:17:26] jesus said our brother lazarus was sick
[1:17:29] come pray for him before he dies
[1:17:31] i imagine jesus wanted to get up right
[1:17:33] there and say my friend last was sick
[1:17:35] i'll go pray for him but the holy ghost
[1:17:37] said sit down amen amen and christ sat
[1:17:40] back down
[1:17:42] the holy ghost said sit one day
[1:17:44] sit two days
[1:17:46] now he's dead now you may arise and go
[1:17:50] why because the father didn't want to
[1:17:52] heal lazarus
[1:17:54] the father wanted to resurrect
[1:17:57] but it took the holy ghost to get a son
[1:18:00] that was obedient not to act upon his
[1:18:02] will
[1:18:03] but the way that god showed him what his
[1:18:05] will was
[1:18:06] what was greater for god to demonstrate
[1:18:08] he was a healer or god to demonstrate he
[1:18:10] could raise a man that was dead four
[1:18:12] days and bring him back to life what was
[1:18:14] radar
[1:18:18] are you following me
[1:18:19] brother brandon said when he went down
[1:18:20] to the gate to the pool of shalom he
[1:18:23] said there was many impotent folks
[1:18:24] sitting around thousands of them waited
[1:18:26] for the trouble underwater
[1:18:28] he said god told christ heal one man
[1:18:31] and get out of there
[1:18:33] christ went down into multitudes
[1:18:35] thousands of people sick you don't think
[1:18:37] he was on his heart he saw a mama with a
[1:18:39] sick baby that could die any day now you
[1:18:41] don't think he would heal that baby he
[1:18:42] said but god said heal one man
[1:18:45] every year when the angel came how many
[1:18:47] did angel heal
[1:18:49] one
[1:18:51] christ was not to break what god had
[1:18:53] established he was only to fulfill what
[1:18:56] god had established
[1:18:58] heal one man
[1:19:00] that's my promise to that pool
[1:19:02] and then after you heal that one man
[1:19:04] leave
[1:19:06] and all those sick people he could have
[1:19:08] commanded one word all of you get up and
[1:19:10] go home and they could have done it but
[1:19:12] in obedience to the father
[1:19:15] one man amen
[1:19:17] and god said i'm going to show you which
[1:19:18] man to heal and he had to find that one
[1:19:20] man said will thou be made whole today
[1:19:24] he said how can i and you know the story
[1:19:26] from there but christ fulfilled the will
[1:19:29] of the father every time
[1:19:31] or you follow me
[1:19:33] i beseech you therefore brother by the
[1:19:35] mercy of god that he presents your body
[1:19:37] as a living sacrifice holy and
[1:19:39] acceptable to god which is listen you're
[1:19:40] a reasonable service why is it your
[1:19:42] reasonable service listen
[1:19:44] as god
[1:19:46] brother branham said redeemed christ's
[1:19:48] body
[1:19:49] do you know he said that
[1:19:51] he said he was the first one redeemed
[1:19:54] and he said by redeeming that body god
[1:19:57] was going to use the blood of that body
[1:19:59] to redeem another body called the bride
[1:20:02] are you following me as that son was the
[1:20:05] first one redeemed that came back listen
[1:20:08] to what adam had
[1:20:10] now there's got to be a bride redeemed
[1:20:12] to come back to what eve should have had
[1:20:15] if she had not fallen or you follow me
[1:20:17] now i want you to watch this present
[1:20:19] your body a living sacrifice which is a
[1:20:21] reasonable service why because ye have
[1:20:23] been brought
[1:20:24] with a price
[1:20:26] listen and be not conformed to this
[1:20:28] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:20:31] of your mind
[1:20:32] that you might prove what is that good
[1:20:34] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:20:37] now let me go back to my scripture
[1:20:39] in
[1:20:40] in uh philippians and i'm a close
[1:20:44] philippians
[1:20:45] the renewing of your mind
[1:20:47] that you might prove the will of god
[1:20:50] the renewing of your mind is not
[1:20:52] teaching
[1:20:53] it's not sitting down and comparing
[1:20:55] scripture with scripture i deal with an
[1:20:58] idea
[1:20:59] renewal of your mind is revealed in
[1:21:00] philippians 2
[1:21:02] verse 5
[1:21:04] let the mind that was in christ
[1:21:06] jesus being you amen who being in the
[1:21:08] form of god thought it not robber to be
[1:21:10] equal with god but made himself of no
[1:21:12] reputation and took upon him a form of a
[1:21:14] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:21:16] men
[1:21:17] and being found and fashioned as a man
[1:21:18] watched this headship now the head she
[1:21:20] put a son he humbled himself
[1:21:23] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:21:25] death of the cross that's gossipity
[1:21:27] wherefore god has highly exalted him now
[1:21:29] watch this
[1:21:31] obedience under headship
[1:21:33] means that god can trust the man
[1:21:36] i want you to get this now i'm closing
[1:21:38] god could trust a man
[1:21:40] to give him more
[1:21:44] once obedient has been
[1:21:46] vindicated
[1:21:48] once obedient has been identified god
[1:21:51] sees by that man's obedience listen i
[1:21:53] could trust him
[1:21:55] more amen
[1:21:58] god gave christ the holy ghost at the
[1:22:00] baptism of john but in the book of
[1:22:01] matthew 17 he didn't give him the
[1:22:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:04] he gave him an adoption what was the
[1:22:07] adoption it showed that he had been the
[1:22:09] right kind of son to fulfill the
[1:22:12] father's will to do his business and so
[1:22:14] god said i can trust that son to give
[1:22:16] him more
[1:22:21] or you follow me
[1:22:22] and then when he was willing to go to
[1:22:24] calvary god said i can trust him because
[1:22:26] he gave everything he had when he rose
[1:22:28] up from the dead he said now all power
[1:22:30] is given to me i can give him more he
[1:22:33] can be trusted
[1:22:37] and when the child in the natural shows
[1:22:39] a mom and dad they can be trusted the
[1:22:40] dad said son i want you to do this son i
[1:22:43] want to do that and when the sun
[1:22:44] shouldn't be trusted one day the sun
[1:22:45] said dad can i borrow your car he said
[1:22:47] sure son why i trust you
[1:22:51] but that's child ability and responsible
[1:22:53] that child acting crazy that's their
[1:22:54] father can't have you boy i ain't
[1:22:55] judging my car
[1:22:56] how much i pay for that car no
[1:22:59] you'll be calling me say come get me i
[1:23:00] don't run onto a bridge or hit a pole or
[1:23:02] something why he know the boy's reckless
[1:23:05] but the boy was the right kind of son
[1:23:07] when he comes a certain age the father
[1:23:09] said i can trust that boy
[1:23:13] now the church has come through seven
[1:23:14] church ages
[1:23:15] she's a mature woman
[1:23:17] what is god looking for in this age he's
[1:23:20] looking for a bride that he can marry
[1:23:22] not a second eve a woman he can look eye
[1:23:24] to eye and say that's my wife i can
[1:23:26] trust her with everything
[1:23:29] i can make her equal with me in the
[1:23:32] kingdom
[1:23:33] brother brown said all that god was he
[1:23:35] poured into christ and in this age all
[1:23:37] that christ is he sees a bride i'm gonna
[1:23:39] pour it into her
[1:23:42] i'm gonna give her the third poor wife i
[1:23:44] can trust that woman
[1:23:48] she won't do nothing with it then i
[1:23:50] wouldn't approve of first
[1:23:54] headship
[1:23:56] why do you see that pill of a clown come
[1:23:58] down like a form of a head nobody
[1:24:01] just ahead
[1:24:02] god has to have a body
[1:24:05] that that head can work through
[1:24:09] but she's got to be willing to put aside
[1:24:11] her thoughts long enough
[1:24:13] that the mind of christ can come into
[1:24:15] her
[1:24:16] let me finish reading
[1:24:18] wherefore god has highly exalted him
[1:24:20] and given him a name which is above
[1:24:22] every name
[1:24:24] don't you realize that when you receive
[1:24:25] the baptism of the holy ghost you take
[1:24:27] on the same name amen
[1:24:32] you carry the name of christ
[1:24:34] jesus christ wherever
[1:24:36] you go
[1:24:39] the same devils that bowed at that
[1:24:41] christ
[1:24:43] the same devil's about to his bride that
[1:24:46] bears his same
[1:24:48] name
[1:24:49] let me finish reading
[1:24:51] that at the name of jesus christ
[1:24:53] every knee shall bow
[1:24:54] of things in heaven and things in earth
[1:24:57] and things under the earth
[1:24:59] and that every tongue should confess
[1:25:01] that jesus christ is lord to the glory
[1:25:04] of god the father
[1:25:07] now that same christ in the bride
[1:25:10] this world is going to confess
[1:25:12] she's his bride
[1:25:14] to the glory of the son
[1:25:18] god told christ
[1:25:20] i've glorified my name
[1:25:23] and
[1:25:24] conjunction i will glorify it
[1:25:28] again amen amen

[1:25:48] husband
[1:25:49] which is the same god

[1:26:14] i'm going to read this quote to you
[1:26:17] and i'm going to let you go
[1:26:21] it comes with a message standing in the
[1:26:22] gap
[1:26:24] i want you to understand
[1:26:26] how immediate this head important
[1:26:28] headship is
[1:26:29] once you watch the brother bam says and
[1:26:30] stand in the gap
[1:26:33] there's a man sitting here on the corner
[1:26:35] he said that's correct
[1:26:37] i've got a wrote down here he said it's
[1:26:40] french way back in the back blonde
[1:26:42] headed handsome looking fellow
[1:26:44] now for those that might not be for me
[1:26:45] what i'm about to read
[1:26:46] brother branham preached i believe was a
[1:26:48] businessman's breakfast
[1:26:50] and there was a young man who was a
[1:26:51] baptist
[1:26:52] that really didn't
[1:26:54] know anything about the meeting
[1:26:56] but he had to be walking by on the
[1:26:58] outside and heard music playing
[1:27:00] and he knew it was a church service and
[1:27:01] he said i'd like to go in just to be a
[1:27:03] part of the service he didn't know if
[1:27:05] there's going to be baptists in there
[1:27:06] with pentecost so he didn't know he just
[1:27:08] heard music
[1:27:09] and his name was danny henry
[1:27:11] and he came into the service and he sat
[1:27:14] down and listened to brother branham
[1:27:15] preach
[1:27:16] being the baptist knowing nothing about
[1:27:17] the supernatural and the pentecostal
[1:27:19] just hearing the word for that hour
[1:27:21] being preached by god's servant
[1:27:23] he came to brother bran after the
[1:27:24] message and said brother branham he said
[1:27:26] what you preach
[1:27:27] could have very well been the 23rd
[1:27:29] chapter of revelations
[1:27:30] he said that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:27:32] and brother baby said when he spoke
[1:27:34] those words it's so pleased the holy
[1:27:36] ghost the holy ghost came upon a man who
[1:27:38] had never spoken in tongues a day in his
[1:27:40] life and he began to prophesy about
[1:27:41] speaking in tongues
[1:27:42] are you following me he said prophesy
[1:27:44] yes brother man said tongues interpret
[1:27:46] is prophecy
[1:27:47] so he began he began the process by
[1:27:49] speaking in tongues but then the
[1:27:50] interpreters came forth with the word to
[1:27:52] interpret what he had just spoken and
[1:27:54] that's why i'm picking up the quote now
[1:27:55] i want you to watch this quote
[1:27:57] and run my title today headship
[1:28:00] and then there was a man sitting on the
[1:28:03] corner he said that's correct i've got
[1:28:05] wrote down he said it's french way back
[1:28:08] in the back of a blonde headed handsome
[1:28:10] looking fellow standing up against the
[1:28:11] wall come forward and compared notes he
[1:28:13] was interpreter the u.n for frank for
[1:28:15] french
[1:28:16] and the man over there victor luke and
[1:28:19] arne vic he said and and this is what it
[1:28:21] says listen
[1:28:23] he said victor leduc of the uh arnie vic
[1:28:26] church out there and wrote down and i've
[1:28:29] got the interpretation of it listen to
[1:28:30] it as i read it
[1:28:32] i victor leduc
[1:28:34] and a full-blooded frenchman
[1:28:36] he said
[1:28:38] born-again christian filled with the
[1:28:39] holy spirit
[1:28:41] my address is 809 north king road los
[1:28:43] angeles 46. i attend the temple
[1:28:47] the bethel temple pastor arnie vic
[1:28:50] pastor a true translation i proclaimed
[1:28:52] of the prophecy said over brother
[1:28:54] branham given by danny henry in french
[1:28:57] february 11 1961 at the full gospel
[1:29:01] businessmen's breakfast a true
[1:29:02] translation of the prophecy
[1:29:04] here is what it said now he's about to
[1:29:06] read the prophecy
[1:29:07] because thou listen has chosen the
[1:29:10] narrow path
[1:29:11] the harder way
[1:29:12] thou has walked in thy own choosing
[1:29:16] now what was a narrow way what was the
[1:29:18] heart of path
[1:29:20] it was the word of god
[1:29:23] he had to be willing of his own freeborn
[1:29:25] agency
[1:29:27] to come under that headship
[1:29:29] god never forced him god never made him
[1:29:32] as a man he had to be willing to come
[1:29:34] subject
[1:29:36] to god's headship now watch this
[1:29:38] brother man i said now i can see that
[1:29:40] moses had to make his choice too
[1:29:43] how thou now go he's going back to the
[1:29:45] prophecy how
[1:29:46] thou has picked the precise and correct
[1:29:49] way correct decision and it is my way
[1:29:53] you see what he brought himself under
[1:29:55] god revealed to him what he wanted done
[1:29:57] and brother branham was willing to
[1:29:58] forsake whatever he had previously been
[1:29:59] taught to come under god's headship
[1:30:02] when god came to me as a baptist he came
[1:30:04] out of baptism so you follow me when god
[1:30:05] came into pentecostal he didn't he
[1:30:07] didn't accept the pentecostal teacher he
[1:30:08] only stayed with what god was revealing
[1:30:10] to him as the word came see under true
[1:30:13] headship god ain't obligated to reveal
[1:30:15] us the whole thing in one time but we
[1:30:17] walk in the light as he reveals the
[1:30:18] light and then we have fellowship with
[1:30:20] god or you follow me and that's exactly
[1:30:22] how the prophet did and i want you to
[1:30:23] watch this my way understand he said
[1:30:25] underline my way the holy spirit is
[1:30:27] speaking back because of this momentous
[1:30:30] decision
[1:30:31] a huge portion of heaven awaits thee now
[1:30:33] i want you to watch this because of his
[1:30:35] decision to come on the obedience of
[1:30:37] headship he was going to be rewarded
[1:30:39] listen for his obedience
[1:30:42] christ was rewarded for his ability
[1:30:44] you're following me
[1:30:45] the bride is going to be rewarded for
[1:30:47] her obedience you will be not obeying
[1:30:49] him for reward you abandoned because you
[1:30:51] love him but because you demonstrated
[1:30:53] that love by obedience god's going to
[1:30:55] honor that with a reward
[1:31:00] so if you're doing it for the reward
[1:31:01] that's the wrong reason you do it
[1:31:03] because he's in you and you love him but
[1:31:05] because he's in you and you love him and
[1:31:06] you obeying his word at the end of the
[1:31:08] road there's a reward for all those that
[1:31:11] are obedient to him
[1:31:12] now i want you to watch this
[1:31:15] because of this momentous decision a
[1:31:16] huge portion of heaven awaits you
[1:31:19] what a glorious decision brother madison
[1:31:21] listen close
[1:31:22] what a glorious decision thou has made
[1:31:25] this in itself is that
[1:31:27] which will make come to pass the
[1:31:29] tremendous victory in love divine
[1:31:32] you notice
[1:31:34] it's the verb before the adverb
[1:31:36] see the french
[1:31:38] now the u.n interpreter interpreted that
[1:31:40] now the boy knows not one word never
[1:31:42] heard never heard such thing as speaking
[1:31:43] in tongues he was a baptist just
[1:31:45] happened to drop in there heard the
[1:31:46] music and said i come up and stand up
[1:31:48] there and listen to me preach
[1:31:50] he said now
[1:31:51] in the love divine brother brown said
[1:31:53] which is divine love
[1:31:55] how can it be divine love if it isn't
[1:31:57] the holy spirit for the holy spirit
[1:32:00] is divine love
[1:32:03] by coming under headship
[1:32:06] he was actually now in a position where
[1:32:08] god could trust him amen
[1:32:11] and because god can trust him
[1:32:13] he's now about to give you a huge
[1:32:15] portion of heaven
[1:32:16] brother brown said when the prophecy
[1:32:17] first came forward he thought when i get
[1:32:19] to heaven am i going to have a big piece
[1:32:21] of property and i have a big the piece
[1:32:22] of land and god going to give me he said
[1:32:24] no the holy ghost came back and gave me
[1:32:25] revelation it's not some piece of land
[1:32:27] he said a huge portion of heaven he said
[1:32:30] what was it it was going to be a greater
[1:32:31] portion or a refilling
[1:32:34] amendment of the baptism of the holy
[1:32:36] ghost
[1:32:38] when christ received his adoption his
[1:32:39] approval of the father he didn't give
[1:32:41] him he didn't he didn't he wasn't born
[1:32:43] again
[1:32:43] but god placed authority in his hand
[1:32:46] don't hear me now hear my
[1:32:49] son
[1:32:51] i can trust him with my word what did
[1:32:54] god do that prophet so lived a life
[1:32:56] dedicated to god that when he was able
[1:32:58] to prove what god's will by the word was
[1:33:00] for this age god was so pleased with him
[1:33:02] that he actually allowed that prophet to
[1:33:04] have access what to the same sword that
[1:33:07] god had he put in his hand the spoken
[1:33:10] word
[1:33:11] this bride ain't going to get back by
[1:33:13] taking her own interpretations by having
[1:33:15] her own ideas there's only one way back
[1:33:16] to that that's by being born again by
[1:33:19] his spirit letting that spirit bring you
[1:33:20] back to his word and by that word you
[1:33:22] live in a life dedicated correctly to
[1:33:24] the word of god and when god sees that
[1:33:27] obedience living in you he said there's
[1:33:29] another one of my sons
[1:33:31] i'm ready to elevate them
[1:33:34] give them the authority of that word
[1:33:38] this is the age of full maturity
[1:33:42] luther's message won't do it's good to
[1:33:44] say i'm saved that's great
[1:33:46] it's good to say i'm sanctified that's
[1:33:48] great it's good to see i've been
[1:33:49] anointed with the gifts that cast out
[1:33:51] devils that's great
[1:33:53] but what the bride really needs
[1:33:55] is a life so sold out to god
[1:33:59] that nothing matters but what he reveals
[1:34:01] to
[1:34:02] her nothing matters
[1:34:05] if i got to lose friends
[1:34:07] let him go
[1:34:09] if i gotta lose family
[1:34:11] let him go
[1:34:12] he's not willing to lose father mother
[1:34:14] brother sister
[1:34:16] everything is not worthy
[1:34:18] of me
[1:34:19] the bride has come to the age
[1:34:22] where she's selling out everything
[1:34:24] listen i'm closing why is she selling
[1:34:26] everything
[1:34:27] it's time to go
[1:34:31] if it's time to go brother gordon what i
[1:34:32] want to hold on to
[1:34:34] if it's time to go for the friend what
[1:34:36] do i want to hold on to
[1:34:40] let go everything
[1:34:44] find a secret place where you can get
[1:34:46] along with god amen and settle in your
[1:34:48] heart lord
[1:34:50] if there's anything in my life
[1:34:52] that stands between me
[1:34:54] and full surrender to your headship
[1:34:57] reveal that to me amen
[1:34:59] david said if there'd be any we can
[1:35:00] think in my heart
[1:35:02] reveal it to me
[1:35:05] i want my life to be so dedicated
[1:35:08] not by my little dudes and don'ts my
[1:35:09] little laws
[1:35:10] little things i can do my flesh that
[1:35:12] prove
[1:35:13] to please some man and say oh look at
[1:35:15] brother mike brother mike dressed so
[1:35:17] nice and dressed so so clean the way he
[1:35:18] dressed
[1:35:20] and he treated his wife so nicely bowed
[1:35:21] to and opened the door for
[1:35:24] you can get your whole witness that can
[1:35:25] do that
[1:35:28] but when my life can testify what this
[1:35:30] book promised
[1:35:32] that the bride in this age would be
[1:35:34] that's when the father nods his head and
[1:35:36] said that's another one amen

[1:36:08] be
