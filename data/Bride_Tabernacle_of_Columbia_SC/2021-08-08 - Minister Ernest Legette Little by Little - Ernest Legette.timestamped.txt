[38:30] through it
[38:32] because it ain't going to be my strength
[38:34] but it's going to be his strength
[38:36] and i said god don't have to show us
[38:38] which he most of time he don't but he
[38:40] says that i put no more on you than what
[38:42] you can bear
[38:44] so that we got to get our mind condition
[38:46] right that we're not afraid of the
[38:47] trials that's overhead i believe it was
[38:49] job said the thing i feared came upon me
[38:52] so we're not fearing what's up ahead
[38:54] we we ready to face the challenge to
[38:57] meet the challenge and it's not because
[38:59] we know we got strength but as greater
[39:01] as he
[39:03] that is in us how many believe that this
[39:05] morning
[39:06] so when we've come to this trial we know
[39:08] that the spirit of the lord is going to
[39:09] do what he's going to lift up a standard
[39:11] against him
[39:12] and sometimes people look at you and put
[39:14] you on a pedestal man you so strong come
[39:16] on but they don't know where your
[39:18] strength come from
[39:19] they don't know where your help where
[39:21] your help coming from i say it like that
[39:24] guy because we look to the heels when we
[39:25] come with our help
[39:27] and we know that there is a power in the
[39:29] name of jesus how many believe that this
[39:31] morning
[39:32] hallelujah you see the word comes when
[39:34] you when we start thinking getting our
[39:36] thinking right
[39:38] and it start changing everything come on
[39:41] like they say you can say hallelujah
[39:42] anyhow
[39:43] say what what trial what's my greatest
[39:45] trial i believe uh paul said oh death
[39:48] where is thy sting come on oh grave
[39:50] where is thy victory come on you got no
[39:53] power over me as jesus said once he said
[39:55] no man taking my life but i lay it down
[39:58] he said you wouldn't have no power over
[39:59] me other than what my father in heaven
[40:01] gave you come on and that's the same
[40:03] thing even here today i don't care what
[40:05] you're going through come on i don't
[40:06] care how your body feels or what you
[40:09] faced with the devil don't got no power
[40:10] over you nothing he can only do whatever
[40:13] the lord allowed come on and if the lord
[40:15] allowed it that means he's going to get
[40:17] some glory out of it he's going to give
[40:19] you grace to make it through it come on
[40:21] and let it like they sing that song
[40:23] god's pulling me through hallelujah i
[40:25] can't walk but he pulling me through

[41:10] transgressions for my name is in him but

[41:21] unto thy adversaries for my angels shall
[41:23] go before thee and bring thee unto the
[41:25] amorites and the hittites and the
[41:27] perizzites and the canaanites and the
[41:29] evites and the jerusalets and i will cut
[41:32] them off
[41:33] thou shalt not bow down to their gods
[41:35] nor serve them
[41:37] nor do after their works but thou shall
[41:40] utterly overthrow them and quite break
[41:42] down their images
[41:44] and ye shall serve the lord your god and
[41:47] he shall bless thy bread and thy water
[41:50] and will take sickness
[41:52] away from the midst of thee don't that
[41:54] sound good this morning
[41:56] he said if you serve the lord your god
[41:59] he shall bless thy bread in thy water
[42:03] and will take sickness away from the
[42:05] midst of thee
[42:07] he says there shall nothing cast their
[42:10] young nor be barren in thy land the
[42:14] number of thy days i will fulfill
[42:17] i will send my fear before thee and will
[42:19] destroy all the people to whom thou
[42:21] shalt come and will make all thine
[42:23] enemies turn their backs unto thee and i
[42:25] will send hornets before thee which
[42:28] shall drive out the hivite and the
[42:29] canaanite in the hit type of
[42:31] from before thee and i will not drive
[42:33] them out from before thee in one year
[42:36] come on
[42:38] he said lest the land become desolate
[42:40] and the beasts of the field multiply
[42:43] against thee by little and little
[42:46] i will drive them out from before thee
[42:48] until thou be increased and inherit the
[42:50] land i will set thy bounds from the red
[42:54] sea even until the sea of the
[42:56] philistines
[42:57] from the desert
[42:59] unto the river
[43:00] i will deliver the inhabitants of the
[43:02] land
[43:03] into your hand and thou shalt drive them
[43:06] out before thee thou shall make no
[43:08] covenant with them nor with their gods
[43:11] they shall not dwell in thy land
[43:13] lest they make thee sin against me for
[43:16] thou
[43:17] serve their gods it will surely
[43:20] be a snare unto thee
[43:22] my god of the blessed to the reading of
[43:24] his word this morning by god's grace i
[43:26] just want to minister to you on a little
[43:29] topic and i entitled it little by little
[43:31] amen
[43:32] little by little at a sub-topic
[43:35] growing into your inheritance amen
[43:38] i said little by little we find that
[43:40] here
[43:41] you know i've been reading over the
[43:43] scripture now for
[43:44] probably the last two weeks and
[43:46] it's just so many rich things in the
[43:48] word of god that you can't you can't
[43:50] never get enough of
[43:53] so it amen
[43:53] reading i was thinking i said lord oh
[43:56] what a promise that you made them
[43:58] and i said you brought him out of a
[44:00] bondage and then he gets them to a place
[44:03] and he begins to talk to them about
[44:06] blessings come on and about things that
[44:08] were in the land and he began to tell
[44:10] them how he was going to deliver them
[44:13] but it was one thing he he told him
[44:16] he made a promise i like that concerning
[44:18] their health he says that i'll take
[44:20] sickness away from you come on
[44:22] and all these things he says i'll drive
[44:24] out all the inhabitants of the land he
[44:27] says he says that uh i'll be an enemy to
[44:29] your enemies come on and an adversary to
[44:32] your adversary come on i said god god
[44:34] has got your back this morning
[44:36] he says but what i'm gonna do i'm gonna
[44:38] send my angel before you
[44:41] he says and he gave them one thing he
[44:42] says i'm gonna send my angel before you
[44:44] and he says that uh i want you to obey
[44:48] him come on he says that whatever i
[44:50] speak he said because my name is in him
[44:52] and when i speak he says that i want you
[44:54] to obey him now as long as you obey him
[44:56] come on he said it won't be no
[44:59] enemies and nothing to be able to stand
[45:01] before you come on
[45:02] he says because that's that's what it is
[45:04] and i says you know a lot of times
[45:07] we we have we have trouble with that
[45:09] come on that's where the trouble come in
[45:11] we want with a lot of times we looking
[45:14] for the blessings of god which he
[45:17] promised to give us come on
[45:19] but he he also desires that we obey him
[45:22] come on
[45:23] he says that he'll give the holy ghost
[45:25] to them that what obey him
[45:27] we know that a lot of times it ain't in
[45:30] begging god you being a son or daughter
[45:33] god we don't have to beg god for certain
[45:36] things for things because what it is god
[45:38] prom god made us promises so when we
[45:41] come to god we don't we don't have to
[45:43] like lord please please begging god but
[45:47] what it is it's all and saying lord you
[45:50] promised it
[45:51] god i've done my part hallelujah and now
[45:55] god i'm looking for you to do your part
[45:57] and i know without a shadow of a doubt
[46:00] that god not only or is he able to do
[46:03] his part but he will fulfill his part
[46:05] and that's what it is we just come to a
[46:08] place to where we remind god of his
[46:10] promises i remember even um god's
[46:14] promises are so powerful you know one
[46:17] thing about it he said his word left us
[46:19] him out and it ain't gonna return void
[46:21] when god you know it's so much uh power
[46:24] and when god speaks you know mountains
[46:27] has to move situations uh has to come
[46:30] back together lives have to be changed
[46:33] when god speak why because that ain't
[46:35] just like a normal man speaking but
[46:37] that's deity speaking that's that's
[46:39] that's power in in what he's saying so
[46:42] we find that i says what it is you know
[46:44] he even promised abraham once he says
[46:48] that in blessing i'mma bless you and
[46:50] multiplying i'm gonna multiply your
[46:51] seeds he said since you obey me says
[46:53] i'll i'll your seeds would be as one
[46:56] place he said the sands of the sea then
[46:58] he says the stars of the heaven then it
[47:00] says you know all because you obey me
[47:02] and then they come to even uh even a
[47:04] place in the children of israel when
[47:06] they were
[47:08] being disobedient and all i remember one
[47:10] time when they sinned against god and
[47:12] god told abraham i mean now abraham but
[47:14] moses he says that that hey i want you
[47:17] to move out of the way i'm gonna destroy
[47:19] him and i'm gonna raise up a nation of
[47:21] you out of you but i'm gonna show you
[47:23] how how rich god promises is
[47:26] because moses even when god told him
[47:29] that he told the lord he said lord he
[47:31] told the lord he got to repent for even
[47:33] thinking like that come on he says
[47:35] because you made a promise to their
[47:36] forefathers that he was going to bless
[47:38] his seed you made a promise to us for
[47:41] and and god that's the promise that you
[47:42] made and the bible said the lord
[47:44] repented didn't it come on
[47:46] and what to do what to keep his promise
[47:49] and that's one thing about it you know
[47:52] god will do his part come on
[47:54] he's looking for you and i to do our
[47:56] part
[47:57] i said lord what it is in me god i i
[48:00] know they ain't dwelling no good thing
[48:03] come on in my body in the flesh we warn
[48:06] against it every day come on
[48:08] but i said god i want to do my part
[48:10] god whatever you ask of me lord that's
[48:12] what i want to do and i know that when i
[48:15] can get to that place to where you
[48:17] walking in such a way that you ain't
[48:19] worry about pleasing man in the church
[48:21] come on get that out your mind
[48:23] you get to that place the way you
[48:25] walking and you pleasing god then it
[48:27] don't matter what the crowd is saying
[48:29] around you and everybody's doing all
[48:31] this come on i remember the scriptures
[48:33] how david says he says many are they
[48:36] that rise up against me come on
[48:38] looking at his situation many that's
[48:39] saying of my soul there ain't no help
[48:41] with him in god
[48:43] he said but thou o lord
[48:46] thou o lord not the church thou lord not
[48:50] my armies and my weapons thou lord are
[48:53] shield for me my glory and the lifter of
[48:56] my head come on
[48:57] it doesn't matter when the whole world
[48:59] is against you how beautiful is the
[49:01] gospel how he even says when my own
[49:03] mother and father forsake me god will
[49:05] pick me up hallelujah when god is on
[49:08] your side
[49:10] it don't matter nothing don't matter
[49:11] when god is on your side
[49:14] hallelujah thousands of armies might
[49:16] come against you but when god is on your
[49:18] side come on open this man eyes that he
[49:21] might see that it's more with us than it
[49:23] is with them i'm rejoicing in the midst
[49:26] of my enemies in the midst of my trials
[49:29] why because i know where my help come
[49:31] from hallelujah
[49:33] i don't know about you i'm encouraged
[49:35] this morning i'm encouraged i just say
[49:38] to follow jesus oh yes i am
[49:40] come on it didn't say through the
[49:42] through the mountaintops and the sun
[49:44] rises
[49:45] but it says do hard trials

[49:50] i'm gonna stay faithful i'm encouraged
[49:53] to walk with jesus oh yes i am
[49:55] oh jesus are you encouraged this morning
[49:58] but i said little by little he says that
[50:01] come on i want you to obey the angel
[50:03] come on in his voice and i said that
[50:05] many times we have a problem
[50:08] with that part
[50:10] with the obedience
[50:11] you know i said one time i says that
[50:13] we'll never be able to
[50:16] ever
[50:16] ever charge god and say lord you didn't
[50:18] do what you said you'd do
[50:21] come on
[50:22] because god always do what he said he'll
[50:24] do
[50:25] if you lined up with this word we'll
[50:26] never be able to say god you didn't do
[50:29] what you promised you'd do
[50:31] we'll never be able to hold god with
[50:32] that charge
[50:33] but long as we walk in according to his
[50:35] word come on he said and bless and i'm
[50:38] gonna bless you
[50:39] i'm gonna be an enemy to your enemies
[50:41] i'm gonna open doors i'm gonna make
[50:42] waves come on i'ma drive the inhabitants
[50:45] out in the land for your sake
[50:47] hallelujah why because i love you
[50:51] oh because you were in my mind before
[50:53] the beginning of time come on lord me
[50:56] but it was many that was better god
[50:58] didn't make no mistakes god saw you just
[51:01] like you were hallelujah but he knew the
[51:03] potential that was in you hallelujah and
[51:07] he reached down and he grabbed you i'm
[51:08] so glad hallelujah you know i couldn't
[51:11] and then you said to yourself you
[51:13] couldn't have made it on your own come
[51:14] on
[51:15] come on you in the world lost
[51:19] without god
[51:21] walking in the way of the wicked come on
[51:23] sin was on your mind every day
[51:26] come on but god
[51:28] the bible says
[51:30] it was what rich in mercy
[51:32] he thought about you when you didn't
[51:34] think about him come on he made ways
[51:37] when the devil had right and he was
[51:39] accusing you to destroy you come on but
[51:42] yet god
[51:43] the bloody lamb was there hallelujah
[51:46] covering that hallelujah because he knew
[51:48] that one day you'd come forth
[51:51] one day you desire to repent
[51:54] one day hallelujah you would hear his
[51:56] voice
[51:57] you recognize who you were
[51:59] oh jesus aren't you glad about that this
[52:02] morning
[52:03] i'm so glad hallelujah
[52:05] oh jesus you know i just love that song
[52:08] so glad i'm yours lord
[52:11] so glad i'm yours
[52:13] so glad you found me and you set me free
[52:16] come on
[52:17] you know what kind of bondage we were in
[52:20] you know we were talking last night and
[52:22] brother thompson and those and we were
[52:24] talking about addictions and how drug
[52:26] addictions and alcohol and things you

[52:38] everything for a piece of for a piece of
[52:40] crap come on they was telling me last
[52:42] night how a man wanted to walk he'd
[52:45] rather walk 10 miles you know from the
[52:48] store just so he can get him a drink

[52:50] in the middle of the dark but what it is
[52:52] those addictions

[52:55] got the people bound
[52:57] it's demon powers come on
[52:59] got their souls in prison spirits bound

[53:11] alcohol i know one that can deliver from
[53:14] crack cocaine and all the demon powers
[53:17] there is no hole

[53:20] too tight that the devil can't let that
[53:23] guard that the devil got on you that god
[53:25] can't set you free he has no spirit or
[53:27] nothing that's in this world that when
[53:29] god speaks they won't have to let you go
[53:32] hallelujah and that's what we get on our
[53:34] knees and pray for god you speak
[53:38] god send your anointing that will
[53:40] destroy the yokes that'll break the
[53:42] shackles off of people's life we don't
[53:44] just want a good sermon but god we want
[53:46] the anointing because we know that that
[53:49] destroys the yolks
[53:51] that unhooks the shackles sets somebody
[53:53] free that they can come and serve the
[53:55] lord hallelujah
[53:57] oh jesus
[53:58] hallelujah
[54:00] you know i was thinking about that
[54:02] when
[54:03] moses
[54:04] down in egypt and pharaoh began to tell
[54:07] him who shall i let go
[54:09] to go out to serve the lord he says we
[54:11] want our young we want our old come on
[54:14] we want our husband we want our wives
[54:16] we want our cattle we don't want to
[54:18] leave
[54:19] not one hoof behind come on and i
[54:21] thought about that come on as he said
[54:23] even here in the scriptures when you go
[54:25] into the land come on you don't make no
[54:27] pacts and things with them because
[54:29] they'll make they'll be a snare to you
[54:31] come on don't make no pact with the
[54:33] devil come on he said who do you want
[54:35] who do you want to leave who do you want
[54:37] delivered i want my children hallelujah
[54:39] i want your children i want my wife i
[54:42] want my loved ones i want all hallelujah
[54:44] i don't want to leave not one hoof
[54:46] behind god save them all oh god
[54:49] hallelujah we don't have to settle with
[54:52] nothing the devil give us come on god
[54:54] said let them go hallelujah let them go
[54:56] all of them let them go oh jesus how
[54:59] many want that this morning
[55:01] oh god somebody get a lot of praise this
[55:04] morning
[55:06] say what it is come on
[55:08] yo i says we have a problem with that
[55:10] with obedience come on many times people
[55:14] have a problem with that like i said you
[55:15] won't be able to hold god
[55:17] you can't hold god charge and say lord
[55:20] you didn't do come on because if you do
[55:22] what god asks you to do god go come
[55:24] through
[55:25] i know that come on it's not that i
[55:27] believe it i know that
[55:29] that god will come through why because
[55:31] that's his word and heaven and earth
[55:33] will pass away before one one jot out
[55:35] his word past heaven and earth will pass
[55:37] away and god will keep his promise he'll
[55:40] uproot he'll tear down he'll do whatever
[55:42] he got to do come on to keep his promise
[55:44] to you
[55:45] hallelujah but we find that i said that
[55:48] says you know you know in the scriptures
[55:50] it says that you know the obeys are
[55:52] better than sacrifice come on
[55:55] come on some people making sacrifices
[55:58] you say doing god a service and they're
[56:00] not being his will come on sometimes we
[56:02] can say lord i'm doing this for you but
[56:04] what did god ask you to do
[56:06] come on
[56:07] and that's what we say god it ain't that
[56:10] i could do this for you lord come on
[56:11] what did god ask you to do
[56:14] you know i believe saul he says lord
[56:15] what will thou have me to do
[56:18] he could have said lord i could speak so
[56:19] many different languages i've been
[56:20] taught at the feet of gamalia i can do
[56:22] all these things for you nobody i
[56:24] believe he had to understand that lord
[56:26] what will thou have me to do
[56:28] i believe if the lord told him he just
[56:30] want him to hold the door i believe he
[56:31] would have just held the door
[56:33] whatever god asked him i believe in his
[56:35] heart he wanted to do whatever god asked
[56:38] him to do and that's what it is come and
[56:40] come in like it says obedience is better
[56:42] than sacrifice lord not saying what can
[56:45] i do for you what i mean what can i do
[56:47] for you lord but lord what will you have
[56:49] me to do
[56:50] god help me find my position you know we
[56:53] were preaching on the foundation a
[56:55] couple of weeks back and says you know
[56:56] that all the stones are fitly framed
[56:58] together to do what to build up the
[57:01] house of god come on when you're talking
[57:03] about some when you talk about being
[57:05] fitted you know like some of those
[57:07] pipefitters and those welders and stuff
[57:09] when they fit certain things it's cut
[57:10] out to go in a certain spot come on and
[57:13] then once you begin cutting on that iron
[57:15] and and doing all this fitting that that
[57:17] that piece up or whatever it is only
[57:18] going to fit in one place so it's got to
[57:20] be cut right
[57:22] and sometimes you know
[57:23] we look at perfection i remember working
[57:26] in the steel mill and sometimes it
[57:28] everything we had zero tolerance
[57:30] because it says you know this building
[57:32] going to be 100 stories high so if you
[57:34] allow 16th here in the eighth here by
[57:37] the time you get to the top you might be
[57:39] you feed off way off the mark come on so
[57:42] we had a zero tolerance sometimes the
[57:44] blade we had certain things we had to do
[57:46] to get that you couldn't cut it right so
[57:49] you cut it a little bit over and then
[57:50] send it up to the hill where the meal
[57:52] was at and they milled that thing and
[57:54] perfect come on they wanted perfection
[57:57] hallelujah and that's what it is that's
[57:59] how god what he desires out of our life
[58:02] come on perfection come on you can't say
[58:05] lord come on i'm gonna eat you off
[58:08] it'll be all right no but when he when
[58:09] you go to pl put you in your position
[58:11] come on then if you off a little bit you
[58:14] ain't gonna fit in there right
[58:15] hallelujah so god don't want you to be
[58:17] uh nothing off come on just let the
[58:19] master work on you let the master build
[58:21] you and make you and moses hallelujah
[58:24] lord i'm weak in this area let them work
[58:26] on you hallelujah
[58:27] oh jesus
[58:29] sometimes we got to get down on our
[58:30] knees
[58:31] and cry out to god i remember many times
[58:34] i cried out to the lord and i said lord
[58:36] i'm afraid of myself because i don't
[58:39] know what i'm capable of god take me
[58:41] lord take control of my mind take
[58:44] control of my mouth take control of my
[58:46] hands all these things are important to
[58:48] me hallelujah because when you go to put
[58:50] me in my position god i want to be right
[58:53] hallelujah i don't know about you but i
[58:56] want to be right
[58:57] oh jesus i don't want to be found
[58:59] without the garment on
[59:01] they need to say brother how'd you get
[59:03] in here hallelujah but you got to come
[59:05] in by the door
[59:07] holy hallelujah
[59:08] oh jesus
[59:10] the bible says straight as the gate how
[59:11] many believe that this morning narrows
[59:14] the way
[59:15] oh but only if you will find it come on
[59:17] i pray that we all being that few
[59:20] well he says you know you're talking
[59:22] about like it says i don't want to be
[59:24] able to finish for the sake of time but
[59:25] just laying a foundation come on little
[59:28] by little you know what he says i want
[59:30] you to obey him come on obama you know
[59:33] the obey is better than the sacrifice
[59:35] the harkin the father rams come on he
[59:38] even called it style that has rebellion
[59:41] he says rebellion is as a center
[59:43] witchcraft
[59:44] come on what it is we don't want to obey
[59:47] god when god speaks come on going
[59:50] against the grain what it is rebellion

[59:55] it ain't a man's word but it's god's
[59:57] word come on lord i want to line up with
[1:00:00] your word

[1:00:22] we've been ministering the last two
[1:00:23] weeks on that day
[1:00:25] it's gonna be between you and god you'll
[1:00:28] have to give an account for the way you
[1:00:29] lived
[1:00:30] hallelujah
[1:00:32] but i want to be able to say lord i did
[1:00:34] the best i could
[1:00:35] hallelujah with what i had a fault
[1:00:39] with all i had god
[1:00:40] when my strength was gone i crawled him
[1:00:43] oh jesus i did all i can do how many
[1:00:46] feel like that this morning come on i
[1:00:49] says little by little oh god made them
[1:00:52] so many great promises didn't he come on
[1:00:54] but he laid that before he says i'm
[1:00:56] gonna send my angel before you say my
[1:00:58] name is in him come on
[1:00:59] and i want you to obey him
[1:01:01] come on and if you obey him i'm gonna
[1:01:04] open everything up for you come on
[1:01:06] but i like how he says i like how he
[1:01:08] says in the scriptures here
[1:01:11] he says it in the
[1:01:13] in the
[1:01:14] in the 30th verse
[1:01:16] well let's look at the 29th verse again
[1:01:18] and this is where i really take my topic
[1:01:21] from he says
[1:01:24] i will not drive them out from before
[1:01:26] thee in one year lest the land become
[1:01:29] desolate and the beasts of the field
[1:01:31] multiply against thee by little and
[1:01:34] little i will drive them out from before
[1:01:36] thee until thou be increased and inherit
[1:01:40] the land come on
[1:01:41] i say what it is a lot of times you know
[1:01:44] we live in
[1:01:46] in in this age
[1:01:48] in this hour where we want things so
[1:01:51] fast come on
[1:01:52] we want it and just sometimes
[1:01:55] if god didn't
[1:01:57] just just do it just that quick
[1:01:58] sometimes that's when we get into that
[1:02:00] mold lord you didn't do what you
[1:02:02] promised you'd do come on
[1:02:03] but what it is you know it's even said
[1:02:06] that your right mental attitude toward
[1:02:08] the word of god
[1:02:10] or bring any promise of god to pass
[1:02:12] come on your your mental attitude got to
[1:02:15] be right
[1:02:16] you'll find some that that say they get
[1:02:19] nothing out of the word but then you'll
[1:02:21] have the man right next to him he
[1:02:23] getting all come on
[1:02:25] why sometimes it's the mental attitude
[1:02:28] some people they want to tempt god god
[1:02:31] you like you god do this come on but
[1:02:33] didn't the devil try that come on
[1:02:35] and it didn't work did it we don't force
[1:02:38] god hands like that come on he's god he
[1:02:40] don't have to prove himself come on he's
[1:02:43] god he can do what he want when he won't
[1:02:45] it's not in us but then you'll have that
[1:02:47] man that other man come on that he's not
[1:02:50] trying to force god hallelujah but he's
[1:02:53] in real need
[1:02:55] he need god to do something for him he
[1:02:57] need god to make a way come on he he
