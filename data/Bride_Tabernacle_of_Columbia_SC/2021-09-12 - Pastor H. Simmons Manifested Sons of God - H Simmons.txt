got to think about amen is he worried that he'll be praised do we want to praise him is he worthy to get to praise amen when we think about amen what he's done for us and what he's joining our lives

god looks beyond our faults look beyond what we think we are going through for he said this morning the suffering of this present time not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us and i'm saying that glory that's revealed in us amen outweighs the suffering that we go through and expressing our amen that glory that he has been revealed in us that glory that god has expressed in us this morning we're talking about the manifested sons of god the manifestation of the sons of god amen as creation wait on that amen we said we this is that amen which amen the scripture amen spoke of that creation was wait no brother and sister you got to come to recognition amen and to realize that the manifested sons of god are not a something to look for in the future but this manifested sons of god has appeared now on the scene by the opening of the word to bring forth amen the revelation and the knowledge that you can enter into your possession your position amen praise god the opening of the word praise god amen brought you over amen into your possession now the placing of sons is your adoption amen so by the grace of god i hope you understand that amen as joshua was the book of joshua was to the children of israel so the book of ephesians is to you and i are you with me joshua talked about a jordan river and crossing over into the promised land are you with me we're talking about amen not only are crossing over into the promised land what we're talking about positionally place in your promise you know it's not enough to taste of the fruits of the land because amen when he sent the spies out they came back and they they bought back the fruits amen but they said there wasn't evil they meant to possess it the land praise god but joshua and caleb had another spirit and they said we're more than able are you with me and i believe that we have some joshuas and caleb's in here this morning and then and those that are listening in we have some joshua and caleb that said we well able praise god i don't look at the circumstances of the condition i'm talking about your conviction amen greater is he that's in you amen the glory that shall be revealed we're not looking at emit the sufferings and the things that we go through in this world amen praise god hallelujah but the manifestation or the manifested sons of god amen let me let me just look again at this 18th verse in romans it says i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not what they're not what come on i mean the devil could tell you about what's going on what you've been through what you're going through and i want to let you know all that the devil is all the lies of the devil amen it won't hinder you and it won't happen to me all that the devil is all the afflictions all the troubles and all the problems and all the conditions you know some folks are not able to face the enemy they're not able to stand up amen before the adversary and amen with all kind of problems and all kind of acquisitions all kind of accusing the brethren amen some people when they look at the accusation and accuse and and all of that they said we can't take the land praise god we can't we can't cross over brother brother and sister that was a they met uh uh joshua and caleb in the bunch amen praise god that was he meant the holy ghost joshua and that was he meant a believer caleb amen that's saying we can't take it amen let us cross over this jordan and brother sister jordan is a representation of death amen in the promised land amen praise god is the type of the baptism of the holy ghost amen and god has promised joshua and caleb the true believer amen are crossing over jordan amen and the crossing over jordan and saying to you and i that we pass from death to life are you with me so you're crossing over amen as a believer amen that you pass from death to life amen praise god this is what god promised you amen across and over amen and the book of joshua speaks of a cross in jordan amen into your promised land a natural land but the book of faith ephesians talks about a crossing over coming out of the world and dying to the things of the flesh and crossing over into the promise of the baptism of the holy ghost into a spiritual land are you with me are y'all following me amen so you're crossing over he said so we know the suffering of this present time we're not compared to be uh uh not worried to be compared with the glory which shall it talks about future which shall be revealed it must be a time when we were talking about future tense we'll talk about present tense amen so when they were talking 2 000 years ago and paul writing this he said it shall that means it was a promise to you and i it meant that there shall be a people that would not say shall amen but a people that would manifest what shall be they meant things that ought to be amen they are right now praise god so god has brought you over into your inheritance praise god he says shall be revealed in us it's something about the opening of the word and opening up the seals and the opening of the book amen it actually showed you your inheritance showed you your position it brought you into your placing are you with me once you can recognize your position amen so the revealing revealed in us now amen he said for the earnest 19th verse for the earnest expectation see amen it has to be an earnest desire amen that the earnest expectation praise god hallelujah oh god when you're expecting something you're expecting it you know you know you know somebody says uh i'm gonna give you amen uh uh a call amen and then yo you know if it's a it's somebody you got confidence in then you were expecting that call amen you begin to get happy because it's on the way praise god my mother's a mama or dad say they're gonna buy me a car amen my expectation amen praise god when i get back i'm gonna bring you s amen this automobile that i promise you amen our earnest expectation amen we're expecting amen the blessing that you've been waiting for it's not only on the way but it is it has arrived amen jesus christ amen the book that's been sealed is open book amen it's no longer a sealed book but it's been open the opening of the word he meant bought jesus christ back to earth again amen he that this ascended is the same that decent praise god the lord himself shall descend with your shout i believe that shout amen has come forth the lord himself he met descended in a shower what it did amen it quickened the seed and brought life back to the believer amen the lord the holy ghost says come down praise god to give you present tense truth to bring christ you can praise god the word in the flesh again praise god as jesus christ anointing amen came when john was baptized in jesus and joined the holy ghost descended in the bottomless shape of the of the dove and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell so the holy ghost comes down and you and i and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell amen god said that i'm with you and i shall be in you are you with me praise god he's not just with us he's in us amen the glory that shall be revealed in us amen to take us away amen that we might lay whole we're not just chasing amen of the fruits of the land how do you know you're in the land they bought the fruits as evidence that they had crossed over and that they what god promised was there praise god brother and sister we are not them that just tastes of the fruit praise god we possess the land are you with me it's not just a land that amen it rains on the chests and the unjust we just don't want they meant the rain to fall on us we want to possess the land are you what man we want to come into our inheritance oh brother sister amen we going a little farther amen he says the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god praise god we cross over joy to die out to ourselves amen we must die to this flesh that christ might be manifested what it what it is it's how we know we cross so we brought back the fruits and the fruits that we bring back are the fruits of the resurrection amen praise god that we possess resurrection power amen we're no longer dead and trespassing in sin amen we're no longer dead amen the world has died we've died to ourselves we died for the things of the world amen if any man be in christ he's a new creation all things are passed away behold all things become new you see in the resurrection amen a new creature we seen somebody he met pray god amen he just didn't come he meant to save he meant you he meant he came he meant to bring back that which was already his you he didn't come to make you seed he came because you are seed praise god because you are seed he sent forth the spirit of adoption amen amen because you are seed because you are the children of god he sent forth the holy ghost to identify the seed praise god not to make you what you amen a seed because you are seed amen then he said as galatians said because you were seed he sent forth the spirit whereby it cries about that god is your father and if he's your father then you are his sons and daughters are you with me and that's what the holy ghost come not to make you a seed because you are seed praise god god amen said you were in him before the foundation of the world praise god you were a part of god they meant you were thought in the mind of god not that we are preaching pre-existence as w amen our pre-existence of the soul or whatever transfer reincarnation and all that stuff but we are talking about you being seed the reason why jesus amen died amen that he might praise god that you might be made manifested he can send back the spirit amen and you can recognize who you are why you were sinner you did not know that you were seed but when the holy ghost come upon you amen you recognize that you are seized praise god while you were in the flesh and in the sin in the world remember once they met you die out to yourself amen the holy ghost come in identify you don't belong to this world you're not of this world praise god you come from god amen god is your father the devil is not your dad praise god this flesh amen is not the real you amen praise god the real you has been identified in the mind of god as an attribute of god is a gene of god before the foundation of the world that's where you were praise god but you are here to manifest that's who you are i'm the manifestations of the sons of god jesus was the son of god manifested in the flesh so are you amen praise god hallelujah but he is god himself amen and your little amateur gods amen praise god because you are his children his sons and daughters so much to go into but i don't want to go into all of that but by the grace of god expectation without any experience you're not looking for anything or expecting nothing that's why people live all kind of ways they don't have nothing to live for they do any kind of crazy i mean anything they ain't got nothing to live for they're not expecting to go to heaven amen they're not expecting the streets of gold they're not expecting a new body amen they don't have any expectation praise god but we that are manifesting in this hour amen we speak of another world amen amen we speak of a new heaven and a new earth amen amen our life is manifesting amen that that is something else praise god that's something else and that's what we're feeding on that's something else amen praise god hallelujah oh god i wanted to get some things but i'm not going to be able to make it there amen but that's what it's all about brother and sister amen oh boy i hide in the world can i get there it's too much to get to but god is good amen i'm just thinking out loud i'm just having a face on the word and i said god this is good it's good food and i'm just eating feeding on the word so here we we're talking about expectation you're wondering why people are so bored because they give up on god because they don't have the expectation they're not expecting god to do what he said they don't believe that god is faithful but i believe god is faithful how about you brother sister i believe it's what's wait it's worth waiting for praise god but i'm not just waiting i have amen the earnest of the inheritance praise god i believe god has given us something able to assure us they meant to take these to dissolve our doubts and take away our fears i believe god has given us blessed assurance praise god that i've already begun to work in you and i'm able to complete it praise god oh god i i i know what paul said i believe that he's i'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day praise god god has given me enough to let me know that amen that i can say he's able he's able to keep that which i've committed praise god i've not committed my life to him and i know he's able to keep it amen the god has reserved in heaven a place for you praise god god has a reason amen in my father's house everywhere many mentions amen god has restored up for you treasures unspeakable amen and you tasted of the amen those treasures ain't that glory to god hallelujah oh nothing in this world can satisfy our soul like jesus amen no achievement no accomplishment nothing that the world can give you can replace jesus amen jesus christ is the lord amen and i'm so glad that he saved man amen i'm so glad that he delivered me i'm so glad that he gave me peace of mind i'm so glad that he give me joy defined i'm so glad that he loves me amen praise god oh i'm happy to be a christian i'm happy to be saved i'm happy to know amen that i have a god to care about me i'm happy to know that i have a friend in jesus i'm happy to know that god is my god praise god hallelujah he gives me peace of mind he gives me joy divine and i'm so glad about it expecting the expectation brother sister friend praise god people give up because they don't believe amen it's worth waiting on praise god it's worth waiting meant to god to fulfill what he said what he promised people give up amen they give up when the battle get hot oh god when their the enemy began to they may come in like a flood people give up but brother and sister i'm holding on amen that's why the songwriter says hold to god's unchanging hand i'm holding to god's unchanging hand why because i know praise god if i let go praise god hallelujah where shall i go remember here it is he says hey expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation now what creation was waiting on is you it's somewhere along the line that's going to be a people to stand up and say the wait is over amen somebody going to stand up and say the wait is over praise god and they're going to say this is that which is spoken up by the prophet paul they admit that the expectation of the creature was waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god and and and you're going to claim your amen your your rights your redemptive rights you're going to lay hold on your redemptive rights and you're gonna say devil back up amen praise god i'm claiming my redemptive rights i'm claiming what jesus died for i'm claiming that he come back not only amen praise god to die and to save us but also to claim that which he died for amen i believe that he's laying claim amen because the book amen says that he's come to claim his earnest his purchase possession are you with me the claim the ownership praise god when he claims you that means amen you and him become one are you with me so he's taking ownership now amen the capstone trumpet amen seed praise god you become one in christ the holy ghost come to seal you in amen so this is the capstone trumpeter are you with me the capstone the headstone come to the body to seal it off praise god the purpose of the holy ghost is come to amen seal the world out and see a christ saying the word in are you with me you and him becoming one are you with me there must be a time when the realization come to you and you recognize amen amen i know i'm bought with the price and i'm not my own praise god i come to surrender my all to god and he's my all in all praise god and once you come into recognition and revelation and knowing amen your position amen you walk with authority in power they made you walk up to goliath and you said i take your head off amen praise god you walk fearlessly amen i'm not afraid of nothing amen because my god amen it's with me not only is it with me he's in me amen and i come in the last day as the invincible army of god praise god showing forth that we are victorious in christ praise god by faith i claim it by faith i i manifest that which is written of me oh lord but some just keep waiting i believe there'll be many that just they meant looking for that to take place when it already took place they'll be sitting around still waiting on him he said the rapture passed right through you he said and they're saying i thought the rapture would take place before the great tribulation come those two prophets appeared over there moses and elijah and israel and they are at the feast of atonement and you said i thought the two prophets of revelation 11 i thought the rapture would take place before that not knowing that you missed the rapture failing to understand what god was doing this present tense hour brother and sister i'm telling you brother and sister it's something that needs we need to wake up we need to wake up and recognize that everything that we need is here now but god is doing the work right now in the midst of us but if we don't recognize it it's not going to do us any good just reading about it talking about the intellectual knowledge won't give it to us it's got to come by revelation christ revealing himself to us by revelation are you with me but to say we believe and not be able to manifest what we believe amen if we say it and cannot do live it then we'll not praise god we don't believe it but when we truly believe it then it comes amen a manifestation a duel of the word not just a hear but a duel praise god you are obligated by god to call god
