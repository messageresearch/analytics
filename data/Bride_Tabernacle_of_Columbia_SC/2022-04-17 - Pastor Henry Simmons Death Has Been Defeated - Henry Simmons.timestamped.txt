[1:09:41] just what is it is it was it any value
[1:09:44] to you
[1:09:46] did it have any purpose or significant
[1:09:49] amen to you what does the resurrection
[1:09:52] mean to you
[1:09:53] amen as an individual how does
[1:09:56] it affect amen my purpose in my life
[1:09:59] what does the resurrection mean to me
[1:10:02] amen it's an individual thing yet you
[1:10:04] know some for some they don't take
[1:10:06] advantage amen of what the resurrection
[1:10:11] means
[1:10:13] amen you will not take advantage of this
[1:10:15] if you didn't know amen praise god what
[1:10:18] it means and what it meant
[1:10:21] amen but it's up to you and i to
[1:10:23] recognize that there is an advantage
[1:10:27] amen in the resurrection
[1:10:30] it proves that death has been
[1:10:35] i said death has been
[1:10:38] take somebody out of hand and say do you
[1:10:39] believe it
[1:10:42] death has been defeated
[1:10:44] praise god
[1:10:46] death has been defeated
[1:10:49] romans 8 said if the spirit that ray 8
[1:10:52] 11 said if the spirit to raise jesus
[1:10:54] from the dead
[1:10:57] if it dwells in you it should also
[1:11:02] or you will be
[1:11:03] if it's in you it's going to what
[1:11:06] it's going to quick and something going
[1:11:08] to happen
[1:11:10] praise god something got to happen
[1:11:13] because if it's the spirit that raised
[1:11:15] jesus from the dead how many you uh uh
[1:11:18] uh have received the holy ghost
[1:11:23] holy ghost without quickening power is
[1:11:26] what
[1:11:29] are you with me
[1:11:31] see
[1:11:31] it it's not to confess but to possess
[1:11:36] holy ghost without quoting power is this
[1:11:38] a words of intelligence and amen words
[1:11:42] that we think that we got but we need
[1:11:44] quitting power
[1:11:47] you know i i i was sharing in uh
[1:11:50] louisville
[1:11:51] concerning amen uh uh
[1:11:54] the the wise and the foolish virgins and
[1:11:57] and they said that uh amen the bride
[1:12:00] don't come and go here to meet him and
[1:12:02] we find that the foolish virgins they
[1:12:05] ran out of
[1:12:06] all are you with me
[1:12:09] they didn't say they didn't have spirit
[1:12:12] it's a type of the holy holy ghost
[1:12:15] amen but they ran out of oil
[1:12:19] and when they ran out they said to those
[1:12:21] that had it
[1:12:23] give us of your all
[1:12:25] right and it said not so amen
[1:12:29] you had to go and buy for yourself
[1:12:32] it's an individual journey i can't give
[1:12:34] you amen mine you got to get your own
[1:12:38] are you with me
[1:12:39] you might see amen me stirred up and
[1:12:42] fired up but i can't give you none of
[1:12:44] mine
[1:12:45] you got to get your own fire
[1:12:50] the reason why they they recognized they
[1:12:53] meant
[1:12:54] something about them they said uh for
[1:12:57] our lamps or what
[1:13:00] our lamps are going out
[1:13:03] have you ever seen amen folk come to
[1:13:05] church
[1:13:06] amen but the lamp's going out
[1:13:09] folk come to church amen and there's no
[1:13:12] fire no
[1:13:14] praise god folks serve god what caused
[1:13:16] your lamps to go out
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:21] we went back in exodus
[1:13:23] and in leviticus and and we find that
[1:13:26] the lamps of god in the tabernacle of
[1:13:28] god the bible said they ought to burn
[1:13:31] always
[1:13:33] and then on leviticus they said it's you
[1:13:36] should never let it go out it should
[1:13:39] burn continuously
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:43] it's got to burn all the time don't

[1:31:08] daughters they're already here i said
[1:31:10] well jennifer though
[1:31:11] gonna be late
[1:31:14] and i told him in office
[1:31:16] i said well what i'm seeing
[1:31:20] then i know
[1:31:21] that
[1:31:22] somebody
[1:31:24] here
[1:31:25] may have the last opportunity
[1:31:30] so i got to be serious with what i'm
[1:31:33] preaching
[1:31:35] y'all might not understand
[1:31:38] but it may be somebody last time
[1:31:43] are you with me amen
[1:31:46] you can walk out of that though
[1:31:49] and don't give jesus christ
[1:31:52] your life
[1:31:54] and don't know where tomorrow go with
[1:31:56] tomorrows
[1:31:59] now everybody listening to me but
[1:32:01] everybody can't hear me
[1:32:06] because
[1:32:07] the majority of their people gonna walk
[1:32:09] out here just like they walked in
[1:32:12] they heard the same thing you heard but
[1:32:15] some people didn't hear me
[1:32:21] but there'll be somebody that we're here
[1:32:24] and i want that one that god has
[1:32:26] ordained to hear to heal the word of the
[1:32:28] lord
[1:32:29] because i know so it's going to be a lot
[1:32:31] of people miss
[1:32:33] but there's somebody here i believe
[1:32:36] god is talking to
[1:32:38] and they hear the word
[1:32:40] but the majority i'm going to tell you
[1:32:43] yeah they said for real
[1:32:46] i'ma tell you for real
[1:32:49] the majority of you gonna walk out here
[1:32:51] the same
[1:32:54] it might be just one person in here
[1:32:56] that can hear
[1:33:00] are you with me
[1:33:06] so i hope that one that god should
[1:33:08] listen to me
[1:33:11] i'm not talking about me preaching to
[1:33:13] you because it's far beyond that
[1:33:16] i'm talking about the voice of god
[1:33:18] that's inside of you telling you what to
[1:33:21] do
[1:33:23] i'm talking about you
[1:33:24] i'm not talking about
[1:33:26] the man in the pulpit i'm talking about
[1:33:28] the man inside you
[1:33:31] the voice that's speaking inside of you
[1:33:34] as an individual you know you hear a
[1:33:36] voice
[1:33:37] sometimes that voice tell you uh-uh not
[1:33:40] now
[1:33:41] and sometimes that voice will tell you
[1:33:44] yes lord i hear you
[1:33:47] you know what i'm saying
[1:33:48] and that's see because the preacher can
[1:33:51] preach but until god speaks to you
[1:33:56] are you with me
[1:33:57] it's just something he's saying
[1:34:00] yeah a lot nice message good good but
[1:34:03] you're going on about your business
[1:34:05] but when that voice in you
[1:34:08] some of y'all know what i'm talking
[1:34:10] about that's what happened when you god
[1:34:11] say it was something about divorce in
[1:34:13] you the preacher was in the pulpit but
[1:34:15] it was divorce in me that made the
[1:34:17] difference
[1:34:20] i realized the voice was speaking inside
[1:34:22] of me telling me to come home
[1:34:26] amen and when that voice spoke inside of
[1:34:28] me i could not deny it
[1:34:31] i would write it in because i know it
[1:34:34] was something i wanted to do
[1:34:38] praise god not something my mama wanted
[1:34:40] me to do other folk wanted me to do but
[1:34:42] something i wanted to do
[1:34:47] i wanted i wanted jesus then
[1:34:50] it became personal
[1:34:53] it says
[1:34:55] by man came also
[1:34:58] the resurrection of the dead
[1:35:00] i gotta
[1:35:01] it says
[1:35:03] for as in adam all what
[1:35:06] first adam you were born in sin shaping
[1:35:08] it in you come to the world
[1:35:09] speaking life nothing you had to do with
[1:35:11] it
[1:35:13] you were center bone born a sinner
[1:35:16] you didn't do nothing to do it
[1:35:19] well why did god let me be born that way
[1:35:20] no i couldn't help myself
[1:35:25] praise god

[1:36:18] you didn't have nothing to do with you
[1:36:20] being in sin and you couldn't get
[1:36:22] yourself out of it

[1:36:35] which one would you rather be still dead
[1:36:38] or will you want to be alive

[1:36:44] just
[1:36:45] plain old happy being dead

[1:37:06] hear with the spirit some folk
[1:37:10] i can get into that maybe it's a little
[1:37:12] too heavy
[1:37:13] but some folk just
[1:37:16] no matter
[1:37:17] if god himself just come down and the
[1:37:20] angels come down with wings
[1:37:23] some folks still wouldn't believe
[1:37:27] they still would say i want to go to
[1:37:28] hell
[1:37:29] because i love what i'm doing
[1:37:32] i'm just having such a wonderful time
[1:37:34] until i wouldn't give it up if an angel
[1:37:36] came from heaven
