in the name of jesus christ amen amen have your bibles tonight we pray that you turn with us to the book of deuteronomy good to see our brother dave amen tonight deuteronomy the 20th chapter let's start the first through the fourth verse when thou goes to battle against our enemies and see as horses in chariots in other words powers and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee amen which brought thee out of the land of egypt and it shall be when ye are come nigh into the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and shall say unto them hear o bride tabernacle hear israel he approached this day into the battle against your enemies let not your heart faint fear not and do not tremble neither be terrified because of them for the lord your god is he that goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you let us pray father we thank you for your comfort of your word lord knowing that your word god can't fail lord i pray that you open up our spiritual understanding god that will see the hour that we are in realizing god that we are in a battle and not on a picnic father you for ordain us for this day lord and you gave us oh god the mighty weapon oh god we thank you tonight oh god for the weapon that you have given to us in the name of jesus christ amen and amen let me see i want to just speak just for a few minutes tonight and i entitled this as i was thinking on war time but then i want to use as your day of battle your day of battle we understand and i believe that we are our witness to realize that we're in a battlefield the word battle it means an extinct extended contest or struggle to secede or survive a contest between two forces an extended battle we're in the hour that we must understand that we came to fight but in fighting you must be armed we look through the church ages and the dark ages of history every age and every generation had something they had to contend with and god knowing that they had to deal with that spirit of that particular age didn't leave them without a weapon church i like to say you got a weapon i know we are facing as he said horses and chariots and word demon powers bible saying ephesians we're not fighting against flesh and blood but as principalities powers rulers of of darkness you can feel the intensity of the spirit that are surrounding you and oppressing against us even when you sleep the demonstration bother you everywhere you turn there is some type of a spirit that is constantly trying to suppress you but thank god he didn't leave us alone we understand that if we don't rise up and fight we're going to be destroyed but i want you to really understand that the battle isn't yours though it's the lord's the bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood he said the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard against that spirit cover 19 ain't no match for jesus christ come on somebody we are not fighting with physical armor but is spiritual [Music] oh my i'm glad god didn't leave us to fight our own battle church he know that we could never we are not a match for what is going on in this hour we are not a match for these demon powers medicine can't even uh uh heal all this that we got going on they don't have the right antidote they don't have the right answers they are just guessing with the people but god got an answer he got an antidote that has been tested proven and been shown that i have the victory not even death can hold him down it's been proven amen is that if your life is hidden in christ you can never die death only takes you in the presence of god and if the same spirit being you that was in christ it will quicken your mortal body we need the quickening power your day of battle we all kind of look like how things used to be and what happened to the old saints and how they had to trust in the lord with all their heart all their mind lean not to their own understanding don't lean to your ability don't don't lead to your success or whatever you may do trust in the lord looking at the standpoint from the old testament how what they had to went through not even yet seeing what god was going to do but just holding fast to god's unchanging word did it had what we got now they had a substitute of a sacrifice of a lamb we get a perfect sacrifice we got a sacrifice that has been torn has been beaten has been cast down yet he said not even death can hold my body down not only that hell couldn't even stop him he went to hell where the devil had the keys at sea he had to go there because satan hold a power a key to death that nobody ever could get out of it oh but our champion the lord jesus christ he went to the region of the loss he went to where satan had the keys and and you know keys go to a door and if he didn't get those keys satan will still have that power but when he went down there that time and knocked on that door and the devil no doubt were wondering who is this he thought he had finished everything but he forgot who was the lord god almighty and when he went the devil no doubt maybe peeped out and probably said to himself i thought i got rid of you but he forget you can't kill the lord god almighty he said i lay my body down and i pick it up see that was god almighty flesh but he thought it was just a prophet just another man with a lot of words but they have seen and they've heard his his authority they said that we never heard a man speak with such authority why because he knew who he was he knew that his purpose had come that i must go to calvary oh my sometimes i wonder whether we really got a real true glimpse of what happened that day let me go to one place in colossians oh my i believe it's colossians 3. yes 14 and 15. it says blotting out the handwriting for artists that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the cross in having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them god triumphing over principalities and powers artisan that was against us that nature of sin he took it to the cross and once and for all he cleared us oh my i'm too glad tonight that you have been cleared you've been pardoned there's nothing against you the blood had had erased all the past all the the old things now all things are become new sorry if i seem to be screaming i'm a little excited about this i like that script that keep coming to my spirit no weapon form against thee shall prosper let me say that again and let me say it like this no weapon form against you see it must be a present tense understanding that you have to understand that nothing he didn't say it won't come but it won't prosper sickness comes but it won't prosper come on somebody rough times come but it won't prosper trials come but they will prosper why because you got the victory greater is he that is in you come on somebody stop looking at the preacher all the time but greater is god that is in you see it must be a personalized experience that you know who is in you come on somebody and when you know he is there you don't worry about it you're not scared come on you're not trembling you're not fearing why because i know who i believe oh my god oh the servant i'm saying he said when the church realized who she is when come on somebody this is not a group thing church when you catch a revelation when the holy ghost reveals himself to you and you know and you know that he's there see that's why you got to know that god is there don't be guessing don't be thinking you got to know oh my but the battle is not yours i'm looking to that day when the church can rise up in faith and understand no matter what comes no matter what goes it can't touch you why because i'll be the best there are angels angels all around here what did the angel come to do it's come to fortify you oh my one time there was he was a large uh servant of god that we're going to battle and not be able to get hazel and they were just them too when this had that was outnumbered and many god told them saying sir look at all the them that is against us man of god said lord open up his eyes i pray the night that god will open up our spiritual eyes give us a revelation god that what we are talking about is not some prehistoric thing but this is reality it becomes more real to me sister brother i'm understanding that if god be for you then who can touch you i say if god be for you who are what conduct you i see who can lay anything to god elect it's god that justifies if a god before us who or what though it come every time those spirits came especially during the seals when those powers began to rise up to 8 god always had something to combat it because he knew what the people needed at that hour church god knows what we need in this hour that's why you have best understand what has been given to you we are not defeated that's that song we got the power come on in the name of jesus don't hell assail us and though the forces of the enemy press against up but god has given us a weapon and the servant of god said the word can defeat the devil any place anywhere at any time but you got to use it what good is you having something in your possession and you don't use it what good is you having a lot of money you don't spend none then why do you have it see god gave us something he just didn't give us just a message to say what he's saying but this message must come alive it must come a manifestation of god in your life see the message the message well what is the message is christ revealing himself in you the hope of glory oh yes sir i'm telling you something i'm enjoying my trip i'm enjoying the things that god has given to me i'm seeing a glimpse you know what the devil been hiding from us see and long he keep you blind and you can't see what god given you and you just stumbling around and stumbling around or the devil having a pity party on you but when you catch a true revelation that no matter what come against you let me just say that again no matter what come against you you got the victory you got the victory over it it don't contain you you contain it why because the power of the god down in your hearts let me tell you something it's getting greater and what god is trying to do i said what he is doing through his the revealing of his word he's getting a people prepared and these people let me go back to deuteronomy again oh my i had a another encounter with that old spirit of back and you know these things are trying to come back on you even after you have pronounced you've been healed they'll try to come back but i understood that the god that healed me god don't do passion work when god does something he does it when god saves he saves to the utmost god just didn't brought you out of the world are you to be a good church member no god wants to fortify you in the holy ghost he want to give you power give you authority over your situations but we're being tested time memorials all the word that we've been getting what have we been doing with it there's a season god i understand he began to do things and pour out the word in such a way and then the people you know if they don't really catch a really revelation of it then god began to let testing time come yes you say you believe god and you got the message of the hour now god wants you to put that to work because no good are you having something you don't use it ain't worth nothing but what we got is precious it can blow the devil out of this world when the holy ghost begin to quicken it god is looking for a super church a church that's going to be moving in heavenly places a church that knows what god want done with the word of this house not just to say what he's saying but to do what the word say amen because jesus said that the works that i do he said you are going to do you are going to do in other it's a continuation of what was started in the bible and you are writing another bible your written epistles read of all men that when they see you like you did in the book of acts when when they had went to the upper room and they uh the holy ghost fell and they came out of that upper room staggering like drunk man and those people saw some people that that didn't look right they they they look crazy they say are they drunk and brother third they said no say but this is the new wine and when that took place you noticed in the book of acts they went forth turning the cities upside down they had to come together we got to stop them from preaching in that name don't let them put them in jail you when they got in jail the prayer of the saints got them out of jail see you can't stop what god start i mean god starts something he know how to finish it and god don't need a big group if god can get one person to submit their lives to him and consecrate themselves that one person can be in a visible army oh my lord have mercy let me tell you something we you we are in a visible army but let me tell you something god did not call us to sit down brother come on sister robinson you just sing that's like here sing it get up sitting down god can't use you god tell all the people for nothing there's a purpose god got a purpose in your life god wants to use you god wanted you to be the light of the city god wants your life to reflect him so that when people see you they say dumb people been with god they know they had something sometimes they went places they say even a shadow of though the disciples healed the people wow because there was such under the influence of the holy ghost but see it's a price to be paid nobody want to pay that kind of price we all want the power of god but who is willing to pay the price we just want to be telling messaged know that slogan a slogan come on but we need to see jesus we need to see the same god that was moving back then moving now come on if he ain't moving in your life then where is your god come on don't talk about elijah that day where is the god of elijah and if god be god where is all his miracles where is the deliverance [Music] lord have mercy oh my i know but it's 7 days it might not be time yet but we might need a trip somewhere something i feel like i'm about to explode because i see the condition of the world and mind-setting i see the spirit that had done made the church cold lukewarm we are backing up and we need to be pressing forward come on we didn't have the little time of time off now it's time to get on fire again come on it's time now let's have all night prayer again come on let's have a revival again let's get a stirring in our heart that lord here i am tonight lord and if i have to stay here all night lord let me stay see any move of god that ever took place it was a price that the people had to pay seymour one man five hours every day praying and ask god you know what god told him i want more five hours and god told me he wanted more how about us tonight how many of us want more are we satisfied i'm not satisfied we never can get satisfied because god got greater things that he wants to do see this church is supposed to do exploits hallelujah what the holy ghost is stirring inside of the people that we got to pay a price to get it because god is the god that weighs action talk i know we ought to do you know i'm gonna feel like doing come on let's go let's silence the day that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city don't you see what's going on in our city don't you see what's going on even in the church world don't you see all what's even going on in our families and people around us but where are the real soldiers oh yeah oh where are those were rugged soldiers who stood on the front line i believe those old sinks laid on that model bench and they begin to sigh and cry lord my child lord lord my child lord lord i don't know where they at god but lord save them oh my how can we get comfortable how can we get satisfied i was telling them you remember i said you know coming to church uh isn't a duty it ought to be a love affair because your love for god is so real and you understood that what he did for you you never can repay it but the little you can do he said love the lord with all thy heart with all thy mind love him and jesus if you love me you keep my commandments oh my lord help us tonight i don't even know where i was at he just said i'm closing in at first verse the bottom he said be not afraid of them don't be afraid because uh they're a biggie number don't be afraid because you may be the only one that really got an understanding of what god wants you to do and the holy ghost move upon you you move amen don't wait on groups it's an individual affair we want the people to come up we want you to come on up because god is on the move i started this thing hallelujah god is on the move but he's on the move in simplicity see he's not for outward show see but god moves supernaturally i just can't get over the thing the sherpa god said he said you know he's it's generally in the darkest hours when the supernatural take place but who's looking for it see you got to be expecting it and i just said it won't rain too i call for it your move ain't going to come until you start called lord i i like sampson so good because even after he had backslid and samson still had enough audacity you know to remember the lord though he was blind and couldn't see samson said lord one more time he told that little boy lead me to the post come on somebody lead me to the post the post is where i'll find god at on your knees in your secret closet that's where you'll find god at samson said oh lord avenge me of my adversary the bible says something killed more at his death than the whole time that he was living church that's why in your death you got to die when you die then god can live the problem is we don't want to die god said crucify your flesh paul said god bailey it's a consonant lord i need more one time i see no we need more yeah we all do but it comes to a time that it got to be personal and you got to call it you got to call it lord i need more i'm tired of coming just to church as a social gathering we need help we need spiritual deliverance and that's what god wants to do lord help us i know we all are in battle but remember the battle is not yours may look at the people and look at what's going on it being something great and look like you outnumbered but he said don't fear him because i'm with you though you may not think god ain't with you because you're going through but god said i'm with you in the late night hour i'm there though all hell seem to be a cell indeed i am there everybody else might forsake you but god won't sometimes the way to my god allow with this thing to happen is to get you alone yeah you know how we don't have to be alone but god said yeah i want to get you alone i i want to one-on-one with you church let's seek god love pastor come let's seek god and know that this is the hour you're gonna have to fight your own battle but it's not you is god god will give you what to say god will give you i'll show you what he will reveal to you god will put words in your mouth he will inspire you that such and such god bless you tonight [Music] praise the lord amen appreciate the word tonight i don't know i i thought about this light at the end of the tunnel he meant gray's got a tunnel sometimes it's kind of dark in there but there's light at the end praise god it's just for a period of time especially when we're going through the mountains and amen but there's light at the end of the tunnel amen you're going through the mountain but there's light at the end of the tunnel we thank god the night at so many things amen i had a message that i thought i was going to preach on the prince of darkness and the prince the prince of this world the prince of darkness and the prince of peace the prince of darkness versus the prince of peace there's a a power amen and satan rules the darkness amen but jesus rules the light are you with me so jesus our prince of peace amen the bible said the prince of this world is going to be cast out isn't that right and who's going to cast them out praise god the prince of peace amen so by the grace of god we realize the god and the devil amen gonna have the last showdown we realized before the bride leaves the earth she gonna have a showdown so by the grace of god we're not leaving here defeated we're leaving him victorious praise god because the power is in the bride praise god the power that's in you got to be on display one day one day amen it's we got to get away from the carnal things and the temporal things amen and start looking into looking into the unseen praise god the invisible god is with you praise god but he's not invisible to you but by faith you see him who's invisible praise god that's what moses was looking at he saw god that was invisible praise god and you must see god that's invisible but he's visible to you by faith you know that god is here because the word has declined him to be here right now in your midst praise god had another message titled the imaginary world praise god and i may get to that on sunday the imaginary world praise god i see some of the children they have imaginary friends and they be talking to the imaginary friends and you say i said one word they just be talking holy conversation imaginary friends and um so what these children doing now and then they got all kind of i guess they got all kind of little cartoons some of the imaginary friends and all of that trying to get them to uh cross over into that imaginary world and to those communicating with spirits and demons and so we'll the children are being taught through the cartoons to go into the demon realm so the cast spells and do uh all kind of things and the little words they used to tell us i had a book that i let brother ernest hold some years ago it was a book uh dancing with the demons the devil amen i never got it back don't never let her preach your book because you won't get it back they told me a long time ago the old preachers don't never let a preacher book because they'll promise you they're going to get it back to you and i used to have my books in my office you notice i put the preachers back here because if i put them in my office all my books would be gone they said brother simon can i borrow this book next thing you know preachers i i let a preacher's borrow some of the books i got from brother mammals he said you know y'all gave me no book a lot of some books i paid a lot of money for i let preachers i don't remember that the show but by the grace of god you keep fighting the good fight of faith saints it won't be long and we'll be going home i said the devil is battling you with all he got but he ain't got much each and every one of us are going through our own personal battle with demon powers but you got to know each and each and every one of us have our own individual battle that we got to fight the prophet god said the devil got one punch for each and every one of us and you got to learn amen what that punch is all about in your life because he said he'll allow that devil to punch you in that area but as soon as you recognize with that area which the devil is punching you in look like he's just punching you punching you're punching he said he got a right to do that amen so what happens if you know the devil got a right to

school there was witnessing and everything and i would get them and take them through georgetown and we walked the streets and witnessed the folk and um one was always trying to do the other not dwayne wasn't worried about that but santego was very you know he he was striving to compass and dwayne always just went on pass went on to pass always but anyway in process right progress and time they both wanted to preach and you know how i am you ain't preaching they kept on saying they want to preach they were very smart young men and you know they had a zeal for god but they were just
