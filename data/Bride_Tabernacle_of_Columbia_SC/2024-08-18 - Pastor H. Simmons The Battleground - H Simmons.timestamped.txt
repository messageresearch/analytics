[32:46] we were just you know meditating upon
[32:49] that the
[32:50] Battleground as the prophet of God says
[32:53] in message the greatest battle ever
[32:55] fought is fought in our minds amen so
[32:58] we're dealing with the
[33:04] Battleground Philippians 4 and 5 he said
[33:09] let your moderation be known unto all
[33:12] men the Lord is what at hand at hand be
[33:16] be careful for nothing but in everything
[33:20] by what pray

[33:43] Minds it'll keep your hearts and Minds
[33:46] through Christ Jesus amen right amen
[33:50] okay he says finally my
[33:54] brethren whatsoever things are what true
[33:57] and whatsoever things are what honest
[34:00] and whatsoever things are just and
[34:03] whatsoever things pure and whatsoever
[34:05] things are what lovely and whatsoever
[34:08] things are what good report if there be
[34:11] any what virtue if there be any what
[34:14] praise praise what think on these
[34:18] things Shake somebody hand and tell them
[34:20] think on these
[34:22] [Music]
[34:25] things amen when you're thinking on
[34:28] these things he says those things which
[34:33] ye have both learned and receive and
[34:37] heard and seen in me do and the God of
[34:40] Peace shall be what with you he'll be
[34:43] with you God bless you you may be seated
[34:46] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[34:48] amen amen
[34:51] amen the brigh of ground think on these
[34:54] things amen amen
[34:57] because we're dealing with now you might
[35:00] say what is the
[35:03] Battleground we understand that the
[35:06] Battle Ground has changed it used to be
[35:09] that uh people will fight battles in the
[35:13] jungles or somewhat in a in no man's
[35:16] land where people didn't dwell and uh
[35:19] the different uh enemies would come and
[35:21] their fight and sometimes they they
[35:25] would have you know back in the Bible
[35:28] Babylon would build a wall and maybe
[35:31] they have water and everything and there
[35:34] it be fortified Behind the Walls and so
[35:36] forth and now we
[35:39] find that uh the modern day uh
[35:44] battles we had Wars in Vietnam and
[35:47] different places and look like they
[35:49] fought in the jungles and so forth and
[35:51] sometimes they went to The Villages and
[35:53] all of that but now we having what we
[35:56] call Urban
[35:58] Warfare and uh we find over in Ukraine
[36:02] and the you know in different places the
[36:05] hospitals are being bombed the cities
[36:07] are being bombed neighborhoods are being
[36:09] bombed and everywhere so the Ware has
[36:12] taking a different route people have
[36:16] to battle the enemy and they have to go
[36:19] from house to house and so forth like
[36:21] that so the Battleground has
[36:24] changed there's no set place where the
[36:28] batt is going to be in a r remember when
[36:30] David was facing a
[36:32] Goliath they they met in the valley and
[36:35] uh the Philistines was on other side and
[36:38] the israels was on one side and they
[36:40] fought to fight the battle they had a a
[36:42] Battle Ground to fight on Fight to go to
[36:45] war in and um we tried to keep it out of
[36:50] the people that wasn't fighting but now
[36:54] you know the
[36:56] Battleground the people may not be uh
[36:59] soldiers or may not be fighting but the
[37:01] war is taken into the
[37:04] city okay so by the grace of God the
[37:09] Battleground that we're talking about is
[37:10] the Mind amen the
[37:14] mind we were saying in Mullins the other
[37:17] night uh we were still dealing with uh
[37:21] death and life is in the power of the
[37:23] tongue and I said to them you got the
[37:27] what
[37:28] you got the
[37:30] power are you with me you have the what
[37:35] power death and life is in the power of
[37:37] the tongue amen now you can speak what
[37:41] you can speak life or you can speak
[37:44] death you got the power death and life
[37:48] is in the power of what tongue you got
[37:53] the
[37:53] power are you with me you have the power
[37:58] amen Shake somebody hand and tell them
[38:00] you got the
[38:02] power you got the
[38:04] power amen what you say if you would say
[38:08] to the
[38:09] mountain if you would say it you got the
[38:13] power are you with me you have the power
[38:18] to speak it amen and to have what you
[38:21] say Amen but you got the power amen you
[38:25] got to believe what you say Amen and
[38:27] then you speak it but if you don't
[38:30] believe it you won't say it you got the
[38:34] power tell somebody again you have the
[38:37] power you have the power amen you have
[38:41] the power yes Amen to speak to word amen
[38:45] spoken word is the orig the seed brother
[38:48] friended you have the power amen so the
[38:53] Battleground we're talking about is in
[38:56] the mind and the greatest battle ever
[38:59] fought it's going to be fought in your
[39:00] mind especially in this age amen
[39:04] especially in this age so
[39:07] um Proverbs 23 and7 you know I I was I
[39:12] was thinking the Lord as I
[39:15] was uh meditating and
[39:18] studying and
[39:21] uh sometimes you you know you run and
[39:24] and get your commentary and I would just
[39:26] send thank you Lord because he was
[39:29] saying this scripture is here and this
[39:31] scripture is there and this scripture is
[39:33] here I said Thank You
[39:35] Lord because so sometime you think
[39:37] you're getting a little old and you're
[39:39] slipping you know you can't quite catch
[39:42] it and I said I was enjoying the Lord
[39:46] because he was saying here it
[39:48] is and then I turned there I said okay
[39:53] uh 23 and 7 it
[39:55] says uh for as he what think in his
[39:59] heart so is he isn't that right so uh
[40:04] sometimes you know you your thoughts
[40:07] mean something because it's your mind
[40:09] now we're talking about control tower
[40:14] let's let us just say control tower
[40:16] control tower now your control tower is
[40:19] your
[40:20] mind the mind is going to control the
[40:23] rest of you are you with me amen control
[40:26] tower
[40:28] okay so if they're fighting for control
[40:32] of your mind now who's
[40:36] fighting the forces from beneath and the
[40:39] forces from above God and
[40:42] Satan are
[40:44] fighting amen good and evil are fighting
[40:48] amen and they're fighting for control
[40:50] of your mind are you with me amen so
[40:54] who's going to win the battle
[40:58] who's going to win the battle this

[41:28] until you can get it in your thought
[41:30] pattern amen amen you have to think it
[41:34] before you speak it because if you're

[42:20] beginning because he's God Amen and he
[42:23] forew you yes amen he knew what you were
[42:26] going to go through before you ever went
[42:29] through it but God has made a way of
[42:32] Escape for you that he forne amen amen
[42:37] are you with me amen so you must know
[42:40] that God has it all in control amen not
[42:43] a control towel now the devil is trying
[42:47] with all his imps and all his demon
[42:52] power to come and bombard you you know
[42:57] sometimes we say the children they they
[43:00] it it it it's got so much coming at them
[43:04] that the children uh uh don't know how
[43:06] to handle it everything is moving so
[43:09] quick and so fast and the mind just
[43:11] can't get it together and sometimes
[43:15] people are are wondering why amen the
[43:18] children are acting like they're acting
[43:20] because they it's so much pressure on
[43:23] them amen amen because we're competing
[43:28] against the whole world so it's it's
[43:31] test after test and this because
[43:34] you God is giving each and every one of
[43:37] you a measure amen amen
[43:40] amen some of us it doesn't we go to our
[43:44] capacity then we still couldn't be but a
[43:47] see
[43:48] student and some of us can go to our
[43:51] capacity and as the world look at it
[43:53] we'll be
[43:54] failures at our best we'll still be a
[43:58] failure but in God's sight amen you
[44:02] might look like a failure God has uh hid
[44:06] it from the wise and The Prudent but
[44:08] reveals himself to babes amen amen in
[44:10] God's sight the world can put you on a
[44:13] certain level and put you in a certain
[44:15] place but God can have you at another
[44:17] whole place because he he don't judge
[44:21] amen he said your ways are not my ways

[45:18] man think it in his heart you sometimes
[45:21] you condemn your own self and you speak
[45:24] words that defeat your own purpose amen

[54:01] thought the next thought is the evil
[54:04] thought and then you better which one
[54:06] I'm going to choose amen amen your
[54:09] action shows which one and what you

[55:10] and the swine went
[55:12] crazy amen they went ran and and drowned
[55:16] themselves a't that right are you with
[55:18] me so that just shows you if the devil
[55:22] can possess the man that was bound in
[55:26] chain and had lost his mind amen the
[55:29] Devils amen said he said Jesus said
[55:32] what's your name he said my name is
[55:35] Legion because we are what many
[55:39] many I often times tell a story about
[55:41] the young man uh I think he was probably
[55:44] a teenager and was no biger and then uh
[55:49] Moses and the Moses
[55:53] Center amen but he was picking up people
[55:55] like
[55:56] little Tony stand up but he could pick
[55:59] he can pick he can pick them the demons
[56:02] hide him he can pick them up they try to
[56:05] hold him down he'll pick him up and he
[56:08] was in church and he was full of the
[56:11] devil and when we said pray he went to
[56:14] calling on
[56:15] Lucifer and all you can see is the foing
[56:18] out of his mouth and his eyes had been
[56:20] turned white and I we probably had
[56:24] double the many people we got here in
[56:26] the church full love with people because
[56:29] the church was
[56:30] smaller and I
[56:34] said I looked at
[56:36] him and I
[56:38] said just he was calling on Lucifer wide
[56:42] open and
[56:43] loud and he wasn't too much older than
[56:45] you Moses and your
[56:48] size but those construction workers
[56:51] couldn't hold him you
[56:53] know how many of you anybody here was
[56:55] there can she you was
[56:57] there I don't
[57:00] know but anyway he was picking them
[57:04] up and I
[57:06] said y'all go in the back cuz we had
[57:09] back y'all y'all take those children in
[57:11] the back amen and when I said take the
[57:14] children in the back you know what
[57:16] happened everybody was taking their
[57:18] children in the back they didn't have no
[57:22] children everybody was
[57:25] running the whole church is running I
[57:27] said y'all get back in here and get on
[57:29] that then start
[57:31] praying and then we had to door on the
[57:33] side like I said open that door and when
[57:37] I said open that door and we I walk down
[57:40] there and we pray and I put usually you
[57:43] put your hand on the people head and
[57:45] something I don't know something said
[57:48] put your hand on his stomach it's like a
[57:50] rock and I told the devil to get out
[57:53] amen and the devil left him amen am amen
[57:57] are you with me amen and when the devil
[57:59] left him uh I told the people to come on
[58:03] back and he was when they come back he
[58:05] was lifting his hand and praising the
[58:09] Lord and uh everybody saw that and the
[58:12] young lady she was there and she had
[58:14] bought her two
[58:16] sons and
[58:19] she had a
[58:21] nightclub and she said she's going to
[58:24] her car and she turn around and she
[58:29] say I saw
[58:31] God and I saw the devil tonight she said
[58:35] will you baptize me in Jesus Christ name
[58:37] I serve the
[58:42] [Music]
[58:45] Lord and and that's what you know God
[58:49] that is a
[58:51] devil people saying ain't no God that's
[58:53] a devil ain't it amen if there a devil
[58:56] there must be a god
[58:58] somewhere are you with me amen
[59:02] so oh Lord but anyway
[59:06] uh we want to look at the picture the
[59:09] heart is decea above all things and
[59:12] desperately wicked am man I just doing
[59:15] what is in my
[59:17] heart come on Amen except you were born
[59:20] again that's it except you were born
[59:24] again amen
[59:27] your heart is going to deceive
[59:32] you he said be not deceive so whatsoever
[59:36] Man
[59:37] soul that shall he re reap isn't that
[59:41] right so if you're not born again if you
[59:45] don't have the Holy Spirit you don't
[59:47] have the Holy Ghost you will be deceived
[59:52] amen the Bible talks about the a mark of
[59:55] the beast he said he receiveth all that

[1:00:03] their
[1:00:05] forehead are in their hand they receive
[1:00:08] the mark of the beast is't that
[1:00:10] right so by uh uh I'm getting too I'm

[1:08:28] people the black people had to set in
[1:08:29] the
[1:08:30] bik are you with
[1:08:32] me so
[1:08:34] I it's the condition we were conditioned
[1:08:38] to to to to think a certain way to
[1:08:42] conduct our lives a certain way because
[1:08:45] Society has conditioned us Amen to think
[1:08:49] a certain

[1:09:59] certain way and people get malice and
[1:10:02] hatred in their heart amen White against

[1:18:31] earthquakes hitting and all of the
[1:18:33] stuff going on in Russia and all of that
[1:18:37] Ukraine and nuclear bombs might fall in
[1:18:40] any time we ain't got time for all that
[1:18:43] other
[1:18:44] stuff the thing we ought to be doing is
[1:18:47] getting closer to the
[1:18:48] Lord are you with me and just loving one
[1:18:52] another and trying to work out whatever
[1:18:54] we need to work out with one another
[1:18:56] let's work this thing
[1:18:58] out because I want you to make it and I
[1:19:00] want to make it and we all want to make
[1:19:02] it is't that right and because we want

[1:19:09] heaven is right around the corner if not
[1:19:12] heaven the Great
[1:19:15] Tribulation is right around the corner
[1:19:18] and the bombs
[1:19:21] will remember as I said the other night
[1:19:25] those seven Vision that the prophet
[1:19:27] saw the sixth one was a woman being vice
[1:19:32] president of President the seven was he
[1:19:35] saw
[1:19:36] Russia bombing
[1:19:39] America and the soldiers ravaging the
[1:19:45] women he saw Los Angeles going under the
[1:19:49] ocean and they said it's sanking every
[1:19:52] day just had a four somebody said they
[1:19:54] had a 5 point
[1:19:56] something and I
[1:19:59] said brother Ernest was telling me he
[1:20:01] was out in San Diego the other week and
[1:20:04] they went out on one of those
[1:20:05] little boats or whatever they said this
[1:20:09] is where it used to be this is where the
[1:20:11] uh uh uh the shore used to be and then
[1:20:15] it was a big sink about 300 ft and said
[1:20:19] this is so it's corroding
[1:20:22] California's going up under the ocean
[1:20:25] and it's just weeping on
[1:20:27] back it
[1:20:29] says and the scientific World they
[1:20:32] expecting the big one Japan and all of
[1:20:35] that is on the Android fault and it's
[1:20:38] going all the way around and the whole
[1:20:40] thing is going to fall even chareston
[1:20:43] has a fault and and it comes up to
[1:20:47] Columbia and we on a
[1:20:49] fault and camelin been feeling it but
[1:20:53] Colombian charson po

[1:20:59] breaking o over there in Lake Murray
[1:21:02] Colombia is down low and it is flood out
[1:21:10] columia so where are
[1:21:14] we we're living in a
[1:21:16] world that's actually falling
[1:21:21] apart but Jesus is coming
[1:21:25] that's our
[1:21:28] hope that's what we're looking to that
[1:21:32] Jesus to come and get us out of here
[1:21:34] amen before all this happen amen I'm
[1:21:38] going to tell you something brother and
[1:21:40] sister if I didn't believe it I wouldn't
[1:21:43] be here
[1:21:45] today but I believe with all my
[1:21:49] heart I said years ago we all believe
[1:21:53] that the Rapture would take place in the
[1:21:57] 80s because the generation that saw the
[1:22:00] Fig Tree and that was Israel become a
[1:22:03] nation should not pass away the whole
[1:22:06] world in the domination of world
[1:22:08] everybody studied Bible prophecy thought
[1:22:10] about 88 the world would be
[1:22:14] ending they put up books and the world
[1:22:17] was
[1:22:18] won but it didn't
[1:22:21] happen and then again in the year 2000
[1:22:25] because the Bible say six days God made
[1:22:27] the Heaven and Earth on the seven days
[1:22:30] rested so everybody was looking
[1:22:33] then I didn't say Well it going to take
[1:22:36] place in 88 I didn't say it's going to
[1:22:38] take place in 2000 I just gave you what
[1:22:40] the scripture
[1:22:42] said are you with me so I wasn't going
[1:22:45] to go to say hey it's going to take
[1:22:47] place hey you know no man know the day
[1:22:49] and the hour none of us was expecting to
[1:22:52] be around here now that believe Bible
[1:22:55] prophecy and study the Bible prophecy
[1:22:58] but we are
[1:23:00] here and in the Sunday school this
