[33:03] And uh you know sometimes we we you work
[33:06] things up in
[33:07] emotionalism, but sometimes you got to
[33:10] think about how good God is to you
[33:13] and what he's done for you and what he's
[33:15] doing for you. And it causes you to
[33:18] worship him. It causes you to praise him
[33:21] and thank him. Praise God.
