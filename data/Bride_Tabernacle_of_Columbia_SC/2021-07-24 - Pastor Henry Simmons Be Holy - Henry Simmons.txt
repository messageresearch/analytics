tonight touch hearts stretch our lives have your way and say in jesus name we pray amen god bless you as we look in the book first peter i'm just going to go first peter 1 and 12 1 and 12 i said 13 but 1 and 12. first peter 1 and 12. unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore girder up the lawns of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be born unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children not fashioned in yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which has called you is holy so be ye what be holy in all what because it is written be ye what for what and god bless you to read this word you may receive it said tonight be holy amen you know i i thought about you know it says just meditating upon the lord what does it mean to be holy what is your definition of holiness or to be holy because i believe people have lost the understanding they used to be a day when you can look at a young lady say that's a holiness person you can look at a young man he said he shows something different about houston young man but we're living in the lies as the oh i'm an old folk now the old folks used to say we're living in the last evil days are you with me amen so we're living in the last days and brother and sister god's servant said the two vines would be so close together that they intertwined the reason why the tears and wheat would come together if you try to pull up one you might pull up the other two so this thing is going to be so tight right the gospel which we preach is tight but it's right [Music] it's got to be something that could discern between right and wrong that's why it's very important that the bride had the gift of discernment but we're coming to a place where there's no respect of authority nowhere authority is disrespected look at it out there on the street people don't respect the law enforcement they don't respect the president they don't expect they don't respect nobody there's no they don't respect the school teachers they don't really it's no respect we're living in a place where people don't do don't give reverence and respect and honor to nobody so it's difficult in this day to try to guide is the teachers in the school have a difficult job very much difficult because if they try to teach the children then their hands are tied by so many different laws and so many different things that they can't even talk to them about god it used to be that we would get up in the morning the first thing we would do when we get into class we will repeat a bible verse god should not steal god should not commit adultery i should not you know everybody go around the class and you do a bible verse you better not do that now isn't that right you might end up in jail or getting fired or something but and then the first thing come over the intercom throughout the school was a prayer to start of the day but you can't do that no more isn't that right so we are misplaced and misled so much and so uh that when you try to tell the people now the people say wrong is right and right is wrong they take the word and it doesn't mean this in greek and it doesn't mean that in hebrew and it doesn't mean that in arabic to you got to be a scholar it used to be that a preacher that couldn't read nor write could get the keys to the kingdom and jesus could have trusted him to preach the gospel amen i remember a preacher by the name of minister boston he couldn't read he said get me so and so on and then somebody read from god business and around here preach and he couldn't preach but he couldn't read but he could preach the word and so what i'm saying nowadays you almost have to have a phd a doctor degree for people to think that they're going to listen to you and i'm gonna tell you something that they're not gonna listen to you with a phd because this is the time of what people write right well the people it's got so chaotic and so confusing and god is not the author of what confusion so we're in a a place where as it was said the whole world would go insane we're living in an insane age the age of insanity that's why the people can do the things that they do and not feel condemned or shamed because satan has creeped into edgy excuse me can i say through educating the people and making them so intelligent like it was in the days of noah they didn't even believe it's going to rain and folk don't believe that it's going to come a time of judgment they don't believe that the world gonna burn as an oven they don't believe that it's gonna catch on fire just as they did not believe in the days of noah neither do they believe today things are going to happen before in this present evil age this evil age god's going to bring judgment upon this crooked and perverse generation judgment is going to happen so let me let me just um put the precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little uh matthew 24 24 20 22 matthew 24 22. let me just try to he says i use i started 21. for then shall be great what there shall be great tribulation such as not since the beginning of the world to this time no no never shall be are you with me things are beginning to happen in that we think that the coronavirus is over now we got the delta strain and we got this and we got that uh is it going to get better things are going to get better is it going to get better the bible said evil men and seducers shall wax what worse and worse are we going to get better better days are coming by when i reach that city long way up in the sky amen troubles will be over i'll have you home at last are you with me see what happens our hope is not what they're hoping for better days on this earth we know amen it's a time that in store for them is called great tribulation amen they think trouble times have come now but you ain't seen you haven't seen what you you haven't seen nothing yet are you with me so brother and sister amen we need to get our affection set on things above because the world amen this disobedient world this world that have rejected god as the jews did when jesus came and the flesh night comes in the form of the revealed word he came in flesh and now he comes in word at the time of restitution he would send forth jesus christ which was before preached unto you are you with me so god has come in restoration of the word and he's been preached unto you which things the angels desire to look unto you amen so the angels just tried to see what you are able to see amen oh god well thank god let me just 22nd verse it says and except those days should be what listen listen what we are we're at the shortness of days except those days be shortened there shall be no one no flesh say i believe we get now i believe we're getting to a place we thought we were out of this and we want to go back to normal is it going to get normal are we going to ever get back to normal i don't know so the people said we don't want to go back to what we were if we don't go back to normal we want to act like we normal you see what i'm saying we want to act and we want to ex we want to go with the flow and we're going to act like everything it's all right when we know it ain't all right children gonna go to school act like there's no coronavirus act like they're gonna go to the ball games they're gonna go to this and they're gonna go act like it this don't exist people are going to die they're going to get sick they're going to do this but we're going to act like it don't exist are you with me see because they can't afford the world can't afford a stoppage again so in order not to stop they got to keep going if it costs because either way you do doom if you stop things are getting worse and worse all they have to do is stop and get right with god get in prayer fast and seeking god and say lord return back what you what would what would you you think they'll do that because why everybody got a different god the true and the living god they don't know who he is brother and sister they can't even find him they don't know who where they look why because even in the church they're supposed to be christians and preachers they're telling them hey everything is fine if this the different religions hindu buddha confucius and muhammad everything is fine all of them got to go the true god but to us there's only one god and his name is jesus christ are you look man so we're not afraid to say to us it's just one god and that's the lord jesus christ are you with me and if we gonna point you anyway we're gonna point you to jesus are you up there joshua no flesh should be saved but father what i remember preaching that summary before the election before the election those days should be shot 23rd then if any man should say unto you lo he is christ are there believing not for there shall arise false christs anointed ones in the end time false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and what oneness amen and so much that if it were what they shall what brothers and sisters is going to be so close and so tight so straight that's why he gave some apostles some prophets some pastor some teach some advantages some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints but they don't exist no more why because the people got a right to do like they won't live like they won't act like they won't they don't respect none no ministry no they just fake it they're not humble people no more the bible said it'd be proud bolsters no respect no more they don't respect ministries they don't spread what ministry do they respect their own sales lovers of their world more than love is the world they don't respect no ministry are you with me people don't respect mama they don't respect daddy they don't respect teacher they don't respect nobody we're living in a god have mercy you look children telling mama what to do they're telling daddy what to do little children you don't wait till they get five and six they're two and three bossing mom around come here baby i ain't come here come here darling they say just like them ain't going about their business you ever seen such a thing as patricia and am i telling the truth am i making these things up these children is something they come out a whole different thing a whole different world oh y'all young people y'all got something to deal with thank god somebody said thank god all mind grown they ain't gone they grown but not gone amen they might be out the house but they still with you why you know i'ma tell you another thing though the older people we old now so they might be around your feet but when they get old they'll be around your heart are you with me so you do more worrying about them when they get grown than you do when they're on your feet somebody so i ain't worried about them if you love them you care about them no matter what you you care about them somebody said you you you tell my children you're grown your daddy just called you you all right caleb how you doing son rachel how you doing you know i'm doing all right that you know you made it to your destination every one day that voice won't do that won't be able to check on you won't be able to care for you just show somebody care you'll be wanting to hear somebody would call you and check on you and won't you know you would want that you know my mama called me you know your mama can see henry you know she called me minister venice you all right i said yeah mom i'm fine just want to see yeah yeah and make sure everything's fine that small you know is that all right the mama care you know how it is you know when you get us you know you know you get up and you think i don't need that nah but you get up but when they don't do it and sometimes we feel a little free and we might do something that we wouldn't normally do but we'll do things when we think nobody cares and nobody got time for me you understand people do things because people uh they won't they want to hear that somebody cares somebody got time for you are you with me if it's ever been a time when people need some attention they need your undivided attention now these children and some of them grown they need a little bit more compassion and understanding from you that you didn't give them when they were little but you can redeem the time because the days are evil instead of telling them what they shouldn't do what they need to stop doing just give them some love give them a little your undivided attention do something for them it may not be birthday time it may not be a holiday time but reach out and show them your camp because if something happened to you you wish you will and it goes vice versa children it don't have to be mama birthday or daddy birthday a mother's day or father's day to show that you care amen i don't know why i'm saying these things but it must be for a reason are you open so i'm saying to you sometimes i get away from my subject but it's always for a purpose so let me just say god i'ma try to he says if it was possible you just see the very leg goodness he didn't just he didn't say he it is deceived elect he said the what the very elay he put emphasis on that they let you know don't you think that you're so special you can't be deceived don't you think you're so saved and so holy amen that you can't be deceived that's why i said it's a bad thing that nobody can tell you nothing you know if you set out and you know folk can tell you some stuff to keep you out a lot of trouble but when you're out on your own that you're so close to god that you talk to god and god you know god you know but you we need one another every one of us we need one another let me go back to peter here and i i wanted to play some emphasis there and maybe it don't go together as some scholars would bring it together but let me go back and put the emphasis here it says because i said people have an understanding in the concept of holiness and it used to be pretty much a person said it was holiness whether they were assembly of god church of god whether they were apostolic whether they were or this or that all holiness people looked alike you see no matter you were telling well that's your holy sister that might be a holy brother you know all holiness people had a distinguished way of caring themselves that they were different so you were different from the rest of the world the rest of the world got to have the um the ladies jordans and the ladies this and the ladies that they gotta keep up with the styles and the fashion of the world some folk can't afford it and some folk can't afford it but and i i i i don't want to get on the young people that feel like there's a need to do those things but i don't want you to have to do those things at the expense of mama not playing a light bill or you got to steal or you got to take some pills for your depression because you feel left out all you got to do is get god hey are you a man and then if god bless you with the lady's shoes you just weighing them abusing them and accusing them they mean they don't mean nothing to you thank god for them are you a man if they're gonna make you look down on somebody else and talk uh-huh you don't need that you're gonna get proud and head up and down and head to show no you don't need that but if you can walk humble amen you can pretty much write what you want longer just not ungodly are you with me so he says here the 16th verse and now i'm gonna try to conclude in a little bit it says be because it is written first peter you know 1 16 because it is written be ye holy for i'm holy you know can you imagine how jesus would look in this generation in this age that we're living in just think what kind of jesus would you picture in this generation how would jesus if he was born here now how would he look and what kind of jesus the holy god you know we know if anybody was holy jesus is holy he said for i am what holy so if you can imagine jesus but people to them the jesus the dale pitching in them in their mind i'm gonna tell you it's not it's not too good really because the image in which is being projected over the pulpit and being preached to them is a flashy cool slick hip jesus with diamond rings and watches and gold chains and all of that that's the kind of jesus you know what i'm saying dale uh they've given you a jesus that flying around in jet planes and doing this and that you know a picture of a jesus how about a jesus that's low and meek and humble you know what i'm saying the picture of jesus amen that can walk and he can no a holy god let me let me just try to give you some pictures before i go there i'll just go to first chronicles here um 16 first chronicles 16. i spent so much time on the other stuff then i'm really finally getting to my subject please help me rachel first chronicles 16. i had all these verses up ahead but i got to skip all those verses and go on down to all that y'all read this chapter sometime they first says give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him saying songs unto him taught ye of all his wonderful works glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually remember his marvelous works that he has done his warmness and his judgment of his mouth oh ye seed of israel his servants ye children of jacob his chosen ones are you glad do you feel like he's speaking to you his chosen one he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth be ye mind for always of his what covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand generation even of the covenant which he made unto abraham and of his oath unto isaac and has confirmed the same in jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when ye were but few even what few and what strange isn't it and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people he suffered what no man do you do then what wrong yay he reprove what cain's for their sake saying what oh touch not mine no they do my prophecy are y'all with me god loves you god protects you god keeps you amen then he says here because god does all these things to you he said sing unto the lord what all the earth show forth from day to day here's what declare his what among the heathens and his marvelous works among all nations for what for great is the lord and what that's why we ought to praise him because he's so great and we don't mind praising him because he's great brother and sister you know it's gotta you know the greatness of god got to be revealed to you amen so he's he's greatly to be praised he also is to be what above all gods for all the gods of the people or what but the lord made what the heaven glory and honor are in in its presence amen strength and gladness are in his what place give unto the lord what the kindreds of the people give unto the lord what glory and strength give unto the lord glory what y'all believing it's doing to his name give it amen he said bring or what and come before him and what worship of the lord and what what is holiness to you worship the lord in what in the beauty of holiness holiness is beautiful i i don't have time i wanted to stay with that uh worship the lord and the beauty of holiness that you know when i was a little boy probably about four or five years old going to church with my art man they was talking about the beauty of holiness and you know sisters used to wait looked like i could all i can remember all of me in white and i remember little little boys almost sliding on the floor i think they had saw those on the floor you know but anyway but they it just seemed like i can go in that little small place and and all the sisters in the white worship the lord in the beauty of holiness folk didn't know nothing but but church they had church in the beauty of holiness and sanctified folk act sanctified again people were glad to say the lord people didn't have much but they had the law and i tell you the truth they didn't have much but they sure was glad to be in the house when somebody would bust out i'm glad to be in the number one more time amen lord i'm glad to be in the number one more time amen and then they say i could have been cut off and gone with the lord i'm glad to be in the number one more time so glad amen they were glad to get in the church they were glad to be in the normal they were glad to make it they meant that now we sing and we just go through the motion we're more worried about staying in tune and harmony they weren't thinking about that if they could they couldn't afford the piano a lot most of the churches couldn't afford the piano piano was expensive i remember sometimes you go to church they have sometimes they have a snare drum they just beat that snare and sometimes they had a a big bass drum and they'll oh boom boom boom you know don't devote them you'd have to be a rich church to have a piano are you with me a scrub bowl yeah that it was but by the grace of god god is good isn't it right now we got all these things and we can't praise the lord he said worship the lord in the what beauty of holiness amen oh god amen because people were glad that they were holy amen they was glad to be holiness amen the bible said follow peace with what all men and holiness without which what no man says see the lord people were glad to be holy people amen let's just go to second corinthians six i got y'all parked me if i'm a little longer than normal second corinthians 6 but by the grace of god god is good holiness is all right it's all right to be thankful to the lord thank him for all he done praise god thank you for you got shoes a place to stay you could have air conditioning and a cushioned seat and we set on you know what we should sit on amen praise god no air condition amen we let the one that's up must get his tails up are you with me but we won't worry about that we're going to church isn't that right we didn't worry about how hot it was how cold it was we came to church to worship god and was glad to get there are you with me now we got all the convenience and we won't even give god thanks amen you can hardly get an amen or praise the lord a hallelujah out of the people why because we got too much amen is what we got making us fat amen that we don't want to praise god no more amen we ought to want to praise god tomorrow amen because god is blessing us with so much so many blessings undeserved god bless me with so many blessings and i don't deserve all the blessings that god has blessed us with are you with me so with all these there's so many blessings undeserved but yet amen we we praise god less and we got we're so blessed amen praise god the bible said when justin when rocks fat she kicked and she lightly steamed the rocketed border amen i'm saying brother and sister let's not be like they were amen when they got fat they kicked against god they they forgot god praise god when they got in trouble the bible said they call on the lord amen but god amen let's not wait till we get in trouble to call on the lord but let us tell god how good he is let

much i don't deserve all your blessings amen praise god god give us bless us in so many ways amen don't look at the little things that god hasn't done for you but look at all the blessings he blessed

battle look where he bought me from oh look where he bought me from thank you god for bringing me out i'm so glad the lord brought me out could have left me down he could have let me be blind but god blessed us on your eyes because you see god is good now second corinthians 6 and 14 it says be ye not what billion second corinthians and 6-14 be not what y'all hear that see sometimes we forget to do the simple things the basis see come sometimes people need to hear something simple all these deep teachings and all the way up jannah we need to come on down here and get some foundation laid and where we can be anchored and then you build your house on a rock amen because if you're building on sinking sand it ain't gonna stand the storm are you with me but if you want your house to stand when
