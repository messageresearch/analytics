[49:22] they're Mighty Hallelujah through God in
[49:24] the pulling down the strongholds and
[49:26] every I like how it says every H thing
[49:29] High thing that exalt itself against the
[49:31] knowledge of God come on anything that
[49:33] exalt itself against what the word of
[49:35] God said Is A Lie this morning y'all
[49:37] believe it come on let every man be a
[49:40] lie let God word be true y'all believe

[49:51] in right it's a battle right it's a
[49:54] battle that we fighting praise the Lord
[49:57] come on but God has giv us giv Us
[49:59] weapons you know I was thinking about
[50:01] how how a lot of times throughout all
[50:04] the ages you know the the the different
[50:06] weapons they advaned right things have
[50:09] changed they might have started out
[50:10] using sticks and stones at one time
[50:12] right but then next thing you know they
[50:14] learned how to make iron so people got
[50:16] swords and Spears now right so the
[50:18] Sticks and Stones ain't going to be able
[50:20] to fight against the the the the swords
[50:22] and the spears right then they came out
[50:24] with the with the bow and arrows didn't
[50:26] they then they say you know the B and
[50:28] arrows they can only shoot so far now
[50:29] somebody got the crossbow right then
[50:32] they come from the crossbow then the
[50:33] Chinese I think it was they invented the
[50:35] gunpowder right but whoever had the best
[50:38] weapons they was the ones who most of
[50:40] the time overcame and conquered
[50:41] everybody else right come on but I don't
[50:43] know no other weapon better than the
[50:45] word of God this morning come on now
[50:47] it's one thing about all these natural
[50:49] weapons they had to advance and keep
[50:51] advancing but God gave us one weapon
[50:54] from the beginning of time Hallelujah
[50:56] and and it's it's enough Hallelujah that
[50:58] when everything else is changing he said
[51:00] I'm the Lord and I change not hallelujah
[51:03] what God did in the beginning was right
[51:06] it worked in and it's working now how
[51:08] many believe that this morning
[51:10] Hallelujah God don't have to change with
[51:13] time ain't it come on he's good all the
[51:15] time ain't he come on but I thought
[51:17] about as the as the age in in the in the
[51:20] in the wars and the things the the the
[51:23] the the weapons advancing right I said
[51:25] they they went to the single shot rifles
[51:27] right then they went to the automatics
[51:30] right then they start somebody made
[51:32] grenades start throwing grenades so
[51:33] whoever had the best weapons was going
[51:35] to win ain't it then they came out with
[51:37] the airplanes and the bombs right now
[51:39] they not advance to Atomic weapons come
[51:42] on now they dropped they got they got uh
[51:45] I think Russia created a bomb they call
[51:47] it Satan Satan
[51:49] too they said they dropped this thing
[51:51] over over in the in in the state of
[51:53] Texas Wipe Out the whole state with one
[51:55] one bomb and they named it Satan
[51:58] Hallelujah come on but ain't nobody
[52:00] better than God this morning come on
[52:02] ain't ain't no no no atomic bomb or
[52:04] nothing can't wipe God out Hallelujah
[52:07] the Bible says that heaven and earth
[52:08] will pass away but the word of God
[52:10] hallelujah that's what's going to remain
[52:12] forever right so that's what I said you
[52:15] got to get the word in you Hallelujah
[52:16] you got to let the Holy Ghost come in
[52:19] come on because when the word is there
[52:20] come on they might destroy this flesh
[52:23] but the soul hallelujah oh Jesus come on
[52:27] I believe that this morning come on we
[52:29] fighting we in a battle y'all in a
[52:30] battle this morning come on but we we
[52:32] singing the whole way through this
[52:34] battle Hallelujah we Victorious the
[52:36] whole way through this fight Hallelujah
[52:38] come on the thing about it I say you
[52:40] know I know how to get all over myself
[52:42] but I say what it is you know once once
[52:45] something it's something about the word
[52:46] of God the word of God has the ability
[52:50] and I try to tell that with people all
[52:51] the time they call you and they got all
[52:54] kind of problems and I said the thing
[52:56] about it is you can tell me all your
[52:58] problems right you can dump it all on me
[53:01] sometime have you feeling a little down
[53:03] too cuz they dumped all but I I said I
[53:06] know one person that you can go to with
[53:08] all of your problems Hallelujah and not
[53:11] only will they listen but they can get
[53:13] you up out of where you at Hallelujah no
[53:15] matter how low you falling or where you
[53:17] got I know one one person I know one
[53:21] that can go down and get you Hallelujah
[53:24] I like that song says if he have to
[53:25] reach lay down Jesus will pick you up
[53:30] sometimes I think about that song about
[53:32] the blood that that never lost his power
[53:34] and how it flows to the highest of
[53:36] mountains down to the lowest of valleys
[53:40] I can see myself I remember praying back
[53:42] then in the Motel 6 thinking about how
[53:44] low I was thinking about how everybody
[53:47] looked like they done cast you away
[53:49] Hallelujah but when I begin crying out
[53:51] to God I said God if you hear me
[53:54] Hallelujah I feel like Jacob he said I
[53:56] ain't worthy of the least of your
[53:58] mercies but God if you hear me if you
[54:00] give me a chance God I serve you I give
[54:03] you all I got hallelujah oh Jesus and I
[54:07] can see that blood reaching down to the
[54:09] lest of valleys people don't cast you
[54:12] away looked at you and said all kind of
[54:14] things but that blood reached down to
[54:16] the L of valys and begin to encourage
[54:19] you to say I know my thoughts concerning
[54:21] you Hallelujah and they're good and not
[54:24] evil everybody cast you away everybody
