[35:01] name we pray
[35:02] [Music]
[35:05] amen amen if you have your Bibles we ask
[35:08] that you turn to Daniel chapter
[35:17] 6 very familiar scripture tonight
[35:35] [Music]
[35:41] when you got it say amen
[35:45] amen Daniel chapter
[35:49] 6 and we'll start at verse
[35:52] three then this Daniel was preferred
[35:55] above the presidents and the princes
[35:58] because an excellent Spirit was with him
[36:01] and the King thought and the King
[36:03] thought to set him over the whole realm
[36:08] then the presidents and the princes
[36:09] sought to find occasion against Daniel
[36:12] concerning the kingdom but they could
[36:14] find none occasion nor fault for as much
[36:18] as he was he was faithful neither was
[36:21] there any error or fault found in him
[36:24] then said these men we shall not find
[36:26] any occasion against this Daniel except
[36:29] we find it against him concerning the
[36:31] law of his God and we'll skip down
[36:37] to verse
[36:40] 16 and the King commanded and they
[36:42] brought Daniel and cast him into the Den
[36:44] of Lions now the king spake and said
[36:47] unto Daniel thy God whom thou servest
[36:50] continually he he will deliver thee and
[36:53] the stone was brought and laid upon the
[36:55] mouth of the den and the King seal
[36:58] sealed it with his own signant and with
[37:00] the signant of his Lords that the
[37:02] purpose might be not might not be Chang
[37:06] concerning Daniel then the king went to
[37:08] his Palace and passed a night fasting
[37:11] neither were instruments of Music
[37:12] brought before him and his sleep went
[37:15] from him then the king arose very early
[37:17] in the morning and went in haste unto
[37:20] the den of lions and when he came to the
[37:22] den he cried with a lamentable voice
[37:25] unto Daniel and the King SP spake and
[37:27] said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the
[37:30] living of the Living God is thy
[37:34] God whom thou servest continually able
[37:37] to deliver thee from the Lions then
[37:41] Daniel said unto the king oh King live
[37:43] forever my God has sent his Angel and
[37:45] has shut the lion's mouth that ye that
[37:48] they have not hurt me for as much as
[37:52] before him innocency was found in me and
[37:55] also before thee Oh King have done no
[37:58] heard then was the king exceedingly glad
[38:01] for him and commanded that they should
[38:03] take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel
[38:05] was taken up out of the den and no M no
[38:08] man of hurt was found upon him because
[38:10] he believed in his God Amen God bless to
[38:13] reading out this word you may be
[38:19] seated and tonight I I'd like to speak
[38:22] on a little topic that the Lord been
[38:24] dealing with me with I I entitled it
[38:27] your
[38:28] reaction your reaction in the subtitle
[38:31] topic that I I had tonight I said he
[38:33] will bring you through amen he will
[38:35] bring you through and I was thinking
[38:37] about this and was kind of torn on where
[38:40] to go and where to start because so many
[38:42] instances where you can look and see
[38:44] where it was all about the reaction that
[38:46] you have it's all about the reaction and
[38:49] you see that when when they made this
[38:52] decree and they came against Daniel they
[38:54] were Daniel didn't get mad at them D
[38:57] Daniel didn't get upset with them and
[38:59] Daniel knew what they were doing Daniel
[39:02] knew that they were con conspiring
[39:04] behind his back to go against him but
[39:06] that didn't stop him from doing what he
[39:08] needed to do that didn't stop him from
[39:10] going forward and doing what he always
[39:12] did because it was life that Daniel was
[39:15] living that had nothing to do with them
[39:17] it had nothing to do with them but it's
[39:20] all about how you react and how you
[39:22] respond and sometimes God will send a
[39:25] test to see how you going to respond God
[39:27] has send that trial to see how you going
[39:29] to respond and that don't mean the trial
[39:32] is going to be easy that don't mean that
[39:34] the trial is going to be something that
[39:36] you hear today and it's gone tomorrow
[39:38] sometimes it takes a while for it to go
[39:40] that doesn't mean that that it's going
[39:42] to be over just like that but it's when
[39:44] you come to the realization that Lord no
[39:47] matter what you going to bring me
[39:49] through it changes your understanding of
[39:51] what you're going through it changes how
[39:53] you reacting to what you're going
[39:55] through it changes the how you even
[39:57] think about what you're going through
[39:58] cuz you said Lord I know that you're
[40:00] going to bring me through and I know
[40:03] that what you're going to do to take me
[40:05] through it's only going to be a blessing
[40:06] for me to go through this I know that
[40:09] when you bring me through it's going to
[40:10] be lessons in this trial it's going to
[40:12] be lessons and when I look back I can
[40:14] say God brought me through it I can
[40:17] understand it in a deeper level because
[40:18] I understand what God has done see
[40:21] Daniel wasn't afraid to go to the Lion's
[40:24] Den because he knew that the God that I
[40:26] served was going to keep keep him he was
[40:28] going to bring him through that Lion's
[40:30] then no matter how hungry the lions were
[40:33] they said in that time the way that they
[40:35] do with the Lions they would starve them
[40:38] they would starve them so when someone
[40:41] get thrown in there it would almost be
[40:43] instantaneous if you read in the next
[40:45] verse in the chapter verse 24 it said
[40:48] and the King commanded and they brought
[40:50] those men which had accused Daniel and
[40:53] they cast him into the Den of Lions them
[40:56] their children and their wives and the
[41:00] Lions had the Mastery of them and break
[41:03] all their bones in pieces orever they
[41:07] came to the bottom of the den before
[41:10] they even hit the bottom of the den the
[41:12] Lions broke all the bones in pieces now
[41:15] imagine how many people that was imagine
[41:18] how many lions there were and so you
[41:21] thinking about and they didn't it just
[41:23] wasn't just one bone was broken maybe
[41:25] they broke the last they said it broke
[41:26] all the bones in their body see
[41:29] sometimes God be protecting you from
[41:31] things that you don't even understand
[41:34] and you think that it's a trial and a
[41:36] tribulation and you upset you mad at
[41:39] what God is doing but he's doing the
[41:41] work and sometimes the work is what you
[41:44] ask God to
[41:46] do sometimes it's not even something
[41:49] that's out of the ordin and out of the
[41:50] realm but it was what you ask but you
[41:52] might not like how God is doing it you
[41:55] might not even understand how God is
[41:56] doing it but when you look back and
[41:58] realize that Lord no matter what is
[42:00] going on you're going to bring me
[42:02] through you start to change how you
[42:04] react you start to change your speech
[42:06] about it you start to change your story
[42:09] about it you start to telling people you
[42:11] know what through it all God is good
[42:13] through it all God is going to bring me
[42:15] through through it all I know God is
[42:17] real through it all I know God is the
[42:19] same yesterday today and forever see I
[42:22] understand that now if I didn't know it
[42:24] yesterday I know it today and say to
[42:27] take you through some things to prove to
[42:29] you that he is God Amen and it might not
[42:32] be what you thought it
[42:34] was maybe you thought it was going to be
[42:36] this big Grand blessing that God say
[42:39] here I'm going to give you this so much
[42:41] money to pay off all your bills or
[42:43] someone to give you a new car but you
[42:45] didn't know that God decided in your
[42:47] life in order to get your attention he
[42:50] was going to take you through a
[42:53] trial because God was still the same God
[42:55] that can bless and give trials and said
[42:58] it's not even your fault sometimes
[43:01] sometimes it's a conversation between
[43:02] God and the devil and the pro and I I
[43:06] said the prophet God I was reading and
[43:07] he said isn't it isn't it strange how
[43:10] God does things he will let us get right
[43:13] down to the last the last mile away you
[43:17] know he likes to do that he did that
[43:19] with the Hebrew children he knew who he
[43:22] could trust amen so the question is can
[43:25] God trust you amen amen say he knew who
[43:28] he could trust amen and I think about
[43:31] the scripture that says he'll put no
[43:33] more on me than than than I can bear and
[43:36] sometimes scriptures aren't just words
[43:38] sometimes they got to become a reality
[43:41] to youen they got to become a life to
[43:43] you they got to be something that's just
[43:45] not something that's here but it's
[43:47] something that's deep down in the inside
[43:49] that you know beyond the shout of a
[43:51] doubt that is real because when it
[43:54] becomes real to you you can live it you
[43:56] can speak it you can walk forth in
[43:58] Authority because you know that it's the
[44:00] truth amen something that's not true you
[44:03] won't believe in you won't step with
[44:05] authority in it if somebody said that's
[44:07] your car if you don't believe it you'll
[44:09] never walk to that car open the doors
[44:11] and figure out the keys is
[44:14] inition because you don't believe it but
[44:17] when you believe it you stepping in a
[44:19] quick haste say that's my car ain't
[44:21] nobody got to tell me twice but see
[44:24] that's how sometimes God will do a thing
[44:26] he'll tell you something and I I want to
[44:28] skip now cuz this was key and read
[44:36] this oh
[44:38] Lord and read this because it Stu it
[44:41] stuck out to me the prophet of God he
[44:43] was saying saying
[44:52] something yes I'll come back but but let
[44:58] me finish this verse and he said he said
[45:01] he knew who he could trust so he let
[45:03] them boys walk right up to the fiery
[45:05] furnace till they could almost smell the
[45:08] fire and he never
[45:10] moved sometimes God will let you get
[45:12] almost to the door almost to the fire
[45:15] before he ever moves and in their case
[45:18] he didn't move until they got in the
[45:20] fire amen amen sometimes you said Lord
[45:23] save me from this save me from this
[45:24] trial but what if that's what you need
[45:27] for it to be your testimony so that you
[45:29] know that God can deliver so that you
[45:32] know that God can save so that you know
[45:34] that God can heal so that you know that
[45:36] God can can do miraculous Works what if
[45:39] that's what you need am amen but yet you
[45:42] praying Lord save me from it amen but
[45:45] sometimes the only way to know is to go
[45:47] through it is to keep going through it
[45:50] amen even when it get hard you keep
[45:52] going through it but it's all about your
[45:54] reaction when you're going through it
[45:57] sometimes you had the wrong reaction so
[45:58] God let it come back around to you and
[46:01] said you know what you let me see if you
[46:03] learn this time and every time you might
[46:06] go through it you learn a little bit
[46:07] something else and a little bit
[46:09] something else but see God in all his
[46:11] wisdom and all his knowing he allows you
[46:13] to go through it CU he's working on you
[46:15] he's building that character in you so
[46:18] that he knows that he can trust you he
[46:20] knows that if I put you in this
[46:22] situation no matter how Bleak it is I
[46:25] know that you going to say Lord I I know
[46:27] it's all well I said something that was
[46:30] going on and I realized I said sometimes
[46:32] you got to ask God for peace amen and
[46:35] you don't realize it until you go
[46:37] through something that you realize is
[46:39] out of your control amen and then when
[46:41] you go through it long enough you
[46:42] realize Lord I need peace I said then
[46:46] you realize that all those promises was
[46:48] given to me and it's really when you
[46:51] come to that point that that you get
[46:53] that understanding that Lord I need you
[46:55] to give me what you said that you would
[46:57] give me Lord I need you to do the things
[47:00] that you said that you would do in my
[47:02] life Lord I need not for anybody else
[47:04] but I need it for
[47:07] myself and see God he's able to move
[47:11] when you have when you get the faith
[47:13] when you elevate your faith to the point
[47:15] that that God can God can meet what you
[47:18] said and meet what you believe and he'll
[47:21] do the work see God is able to do the
[47:24] things that you ask him to doen He's
[47:28] Able said the prophet of God he said we
[47:31] speak faith we talk of Faith but I
[47:35] wonder sometimes if we know what we're
[47:37] talking
[47:39] about he said I wonder if it isn't
[47:42] hope instead of
[47:45] faith and sometimes I realize we get to
[47:48] quoting God's word and we get to quoting
[47:50] but sometimes do you really have faith
[47:52] in it amen or are you just hoping that
[47:54] God does what he says
[47:58] cuz there's a
[47:59] difference he said he said Faith doesn't
[48:03] move when you have faith in something
[48:06] there's nothing that can deter you from
[48:08] that being true there's nothing from you
[48:11] believing that it's going to happen
[48:13] there's nothing that can stop no nobody
[48:16] telling you nobody discouraging you no
[48:18] demon from hell can stop you from
[48:20] believing that it's going to happen amen
[48:22] amen that's what faith does it don't
[48:24] move to the right or to the left it
[48:26] stays right on that rock that Revelation
[48:28] that you have in the deep inside of you
[48:31] and you can stand on it no matter what
[48:34] people say he said I wonder if it isn't
[48:37] hope instead of Faith amen so the
[48:40] question are you hoping or do you have
[48:43] faith are you hoping that you make it or
[48:46] do you believe that you going to make it
[48:48] cuz there's a difference he said no
[48:50] matter how contrary it look Faith stays
[48:53] right there it never moves see when you
[48:57] have faith you won't
[48:59] move you'll stand right firm on it amen
[49:03] if you believe that God has saved you
[49:04] from your sin nobody can ever take you
[49:07] convince you that God didn't save you am
[49:10] nobody can cuz you believe it you had
[49:12] faith in it and there was nothing
[49:14] anybody could say that could move you
[49:16] see that's Faith
[49:19] amen that's faith when you go and you do
[49:22] things in life sometimes you got to have
[49:24] faith you got to move with an
[49:26] understanding that God has spoke to me
[49:28] and this is what I'm supposed to do and
[49:30] when you have faith in what God has told
[49:32] you to do you're not worried about
[49:33] anything anybody else say cuz you know
[49:36] that's where God has placed you but are
[49:39] you hoping this is where God placed you
[49:41] or do you have faith that this is where
[49:43] God has me see that thing stood out to
[49:46] me cuz it's like you can hear the word
[49:48] of God but are you hoping or do you have
[49:51] faith amen go
[49:53] ahead I said but it's it's about your
[49:56] reaction
[49:57] because when you have faith to believe
[50:00] believe then God can do the impossible
[50:02] God can do what you ask him to do and he
[50:04] will do it he said but when real real
[50:07] faith is caught a vision it can keep
[50:10] silent and rest calmly because it knows
[50:14] it's going to happen amen faith will
[50:17] rest with perfect Assurance no matter
[50:19] what the storms are saying how contrary
[50:22] it look Faith rest with
[50:24] Assurance faith can take a stand upon a
[50:27] walk a rock look into a grave or into
[50:30] the waters where a lovely chunk of our
[50:33] lovely loving heart has been buried and
[50:36] faith can look across the sea the the
[50:38] sea to him that said I am the
[50:41] resurrection in the
[50:44] Life see that's what faith is I said do
[50:48] you believe that God can bring you
[50:50] through
[50:51] amen yes do you believe that God can
[50:54] bring you through what whatever it may
[50:57] be whatever you may go through do you
[51:00] believe that God will bring you through
[51:02] do you have faith in it amen do you
[51:05] truly have faith in it because if you do
[51:10] then you don't have to worry about it
[51:11] brother Brown was speaking later on he
[51:13] said and it doesn't matter what level
[51:15] your faith is to paraphrase it he said
[51:18] some of us have faith of a mustard
[51:20] seed just because it's a mustard seed fi
[51:24] don't mean it ain't going to happen amen
[51:26] but when you have that faith of the
[51:27] mustard seed you can't be moved so if
[51:30] you believe that God is going to do
[51:32] something some people have great faith
[51:33] so things happen faster things happen
[51:37] great because their faith has been built
[51:39] up to a level that something can happen
[51:41] just like that when they believe but
[51:43] that doesn't mean your faith is any
[51:44] smaller than theirs it just means that
[51:47] God is doing something to grow your
[51:48] faith said a mustard seed can grow into
[51:51] a great tree but when you see the seed
[51:55] it's very small it's very small but see
[51:58] there's nothing that you he said you
[52:00] can't mix anything with that Mustard
[52:02] Seed there's nothing that can be mixed
[52:04] with it it is what it is that doesn't
[52:06] change it because this comes or that
[52:08] comes or anything comes to mix with it
[52:10] it is what it is when you taste the
[52:12] mustard mustard you know what the
[52:14] mustard is it is what it is and see when
[52:18] you have that Faith to the level that
[52:20] you can believe God in such a way that
[52:22] nothing can take away from you you can
[52:24] have the right reaction amen go ahead
[52:27] when the test come you can have the
[52:29] right reaction amen cuz your reaction is
[52:31] Lord I believe amen amen that's why the
[52:34] prophet of God said the angel of the
[52:35] Lord he loved that song only believe
[52:38] amen only believe cuz he said when their
[52:41] faith raises to a certain level with my
[52:43] faith things can
[52:44] happen see but is your faith has to
[52:47] elevate there the reason why things
[52:50] don't happen is cuz you don't have the
[52:51] faith yet the reason why things don't
[52:54] happen is cuz you don't have the faith
[52:56] or when God is trying to build the faith
[52:59] you say Lord I don't want
[53:01] it when God is trying to build your
[53:03] faith he taking you through something
[53:05] you say Lord deliver
[53:08] me and think that's the way to get
[53:11] through it but sometime God got to take
[53:13] you through it in order to build your
[53:15] faith to increase your faith so that you
[53:17] can overcome amen he wasn't doing this
[53:20] for a quick fix he was doing this so
[53:22] that you can be a victorious in the rest
[53:24] of your life amen amen he was doing this
[53:27] he made you go through this so that you
[53:29] could be victorious in the rest of your
[53:31] life am but you say Lord deliver me I
[53:34] don't want to go through this well when
[53:36] is it time for you to go through
[53:39] something when is it time for you to you
[53:41] to actually go through
[53:44] something otherwise all your life you
[53:46] going to be saying Lord deliver me from
[53:47] this Lord deliver me from this and
[53:49] wonder why you ain't move forward in
[53:52] God everybody there Ain nobody in the
[53:54] Bible that that didn't go through
[53:56] something something even Jesus
[53:59] did so what makes you think that you
[54:02] higher than
[54:03] him he's the one that came down and went
[54:06] through these things just for you just
[54:08] for me so that he could save you he he
[54:11] even showed you that sometimes you got
[54:13] to suffer amen sometimes you got to go
[54:16] through anch sometimes you got to go
[54:18] through things he said if this cup could
[54:21] pass let let it pass but then he said
[54:23] not my will but thy will be done amen
[54:26] even God tested
[54:29] him but yet you want you don't want to
[54:31] go through
[54:34] nothing but in order for God to give you
[54:37] Victory you got to go through something
[54:39] amen come on in order for God to to
[54:43] deliver he got to take you through
[54:45] something but when you come through it
[54:47] you could shout you can scream you can
[54:49] thank God because you made it through
[54:52] amen you can thank God because you seen
[54:54] God do work in your life amen you seen
[54:56] God do something for you that you can't
[54:59] tell nobody else but you know that God
[55:00] is real am and see you going to need
[55:03] situation and things that you've been
[55:05] through for you to hold on to something
[55:07] you to hold on when times get tough and
[55:09] times get rough you can turn back and
[55:11] say God I seen you God I know that you
[55:15] real cuz some may try to talk you out of
[55:18] it cuz they don't have an experience am
[55:21] Jesus amen they don't have an experience
[55:24] with God but yet you listen
[55:27] you listen to ones that don't have an
[55:29] experience with God and think that they
[55:31] high because they can do these things
[55:33] and they're
[55:35] intelligent but when you meet someone
[55:37] with an experience with God they only
[55:39] going to tell you what's real they only
[55:41] going to tell you the truth and they not
[55:43] going to tell you because they want to
[55:45] get on you but it's because they love
[55:47] you am go
[55:49] ahead see that's what God does but you
[55:52] might come up to them and react the
[55:53] wrong way and you reacting a different
[55:56] way to somebody else but the one that's
[55:58] there trying to help you trying to help
[56:00] you understand that God is real and
[56:02] trying to get you over and be there and
[56:05] pray for you you reacting the wrong way
[56:07] to
[56:08] them come on but see God is trying to do
[56:11] something and tell you no you got to
[56:13] change your reaction amen sometime you
[56:15] got to be still and be silent and listen
[56:19] go amen cuz God trying to tell you
[56:21] something that you trying to overlook
[56:23] and trying to push by the side uh I
[56:25] don't want to hear it
[56:28] so
[56:31] you see but that's the wrong
[56:34] reaction cuz God may be trying to do
[56:36] something to get you to spare you some
[56:38] life headaches some life burdens and
[56:41] some life trials and tribulation but if
[56:43] you keep in your your ears
[56:46] [Music]
[56:47] stopped that face that you have where
[56:50] you got that
[56:54] bling and you do that see God see all of
[56:58] that God's watching you and he's
[57:02] watching your
[57:04] reactions and he's watching and seeing
[57:06] how you
[57:07] react and he's paying
[57:10] attention and he's looking who can I
[57:14] trust can I trust you can I trust you
[57:18] can I trust you because there's going to
[57:21] be a time and place and a point that you
[57:24] going to need God and it might be sooner
[57:27] than you
[57:28] think it might be sooner than you think
[57:30] that God is trying to do these things
[57:32] cuz it might be a short quick
[57:35] work but right now he's preparing you
[57:38] he's allowing you to go through things
[57:40] so that you can understand that God is
[57:43] doing these things it's not anything
[57:45] that you're doing God is taking you
[57:47] through these things and he's using them
[57:50] to prepare you he's using them to change
[57:53] your life he's using them so that you
[57:55] can come and say Lord I know that you're
[57:57] real for myself I'm not leaning on this
[57:59] person or that person Lord I know you
[58:01] real for myself cuz you going to need
[58:04] God for yourself you ain't going to be
[58:06] able to lean on the left for the right
[58:08] you got to have God for yourself you got
[58:11] to have your own experience with God you
[58:13] got to know that when I get on my knees
[58:15] God hears me I don't need extenuating
[58:18] person I don't need the pastor mom or
[58:20] daddy to pray I got to pray amen I got
[58:23] to have that relationship with God I got
[58:26] when I come and see God I know that he
[58:28] knows me and I know him it's not an
[58:31] unfamiliar voice amen see God knows this
[58:35] that's why he might take you through a
[58:37] thing or two so that you can I was just
[58:39] speaking last week and and I was saying
[58:41] that sometimes we look at every storm
[58:44] and we think it's a bad
[58:46] thing but some storms are good things
[58:48] cuz they can put things into place amen
[58:51] we always looking you might look at the
[58:53] Thunder you looking at the lightning but
[58:55] you can't see what the storm is doing
[58:57] for you see sometime God will bring test
[59:00] and trial and you looking at the test
[59:02] you looking at the trial but you ain't
[59:04] seeing how it's making you pray you
[59:06] ain't seeing how it's making you call on
[59:08] the Lord you ain't looking how it's
[59:10] making you get on your knees you ain't
[59:12] looking how it's making you read your
[59:14] Bible you ain't looking how it's making
[59:15] you study the word of God you ain't
[59:17] looking at all that all you seeing is
[59:19] your test in your
[59:21] trial but sometimes you got to look
[59:24] outside and say Lord thank you for the
[59:26] blessing amen you never thought you
[59:29] would say your trial was your blessing
[59:32] but it can be amen you never thought
[59:35] that what I'm going through is actually
[59:36] a blessing but sometimes that's the
[59:38] thing that get you down on your knees
[59:40] amen God and say you know I tried this I
[59:43] tried this I tried to come across the
[59:45] pull pit to get your attention but you
[59:47] didn't want to listen so now I got to
[59:49] send the
[59:51] trial to get you exactly what I've been
[59:54] telling you to do all along
[59:56] but God is able to do it and it's just a
[59:59] reminder that he going to bring you
[1:00:01] right on through it you just got to
[1:00:03] trust him you got to believe them you
[1:00:05] got to get down and in faith and say
[1:00:07] Lord I I I don't understand it but I
[1:00:11] know that you going to bring me through
[1:00:14] Lord I don't understand why and
[1:00:17] sometimes it's not for your
[1:00:18] understanding but it's for God to say
[1:00:20] you know what now you trust me amen now
[1:00:25] I can do greater work
[1:00:26] works now you trust me now I can do what
[1:00:31] you asked now you trust me now when I
[1:00:35] tell you to go right you going to go
[1:00:36] right and you ain't going to ask no
[1:00:38] questions when I tell you to go left you
[1:00:40] going to go left and you ain't going to
[1:00:42] ask no questions cuz now you trust me
[1:00:45] cuz you understand that it's out of your
[1:00:47] purpose and out of your plan but it's
[1:00:49] his will amen you understand that it's
[1:00:52] greater than you amen it's for him to do
[1:00:56] his good work inside of you that's for
[1:00:58] him to do and when you understand that
[1:01:01] you start looking at things different in
[1:01:03] life said whether this happened or this
[1:01:06] happened I'm not worried about it
[1:01:07] happening because Lord you got a purpose
[1:01:09] and you got a plan so whether I want it
[1:01:11] to go this way or that way that don't
[1:01:13] really matter because Lord I want you to
[1:01:15] have your perfect will in my life see I
[1:01:18] don't want to just be doing something to
[1:01:20] do cuz it's too late it's too late in
[1:01:23] the evening for us to be doing stuff
[1:01:26] that ain't got no qualms about
[1:01:29] nothing but when you get to the point to
[1:01:32] say Lord I want your will to be done
[1:01:35] Life
[1:01:36] Changes because you come to the point of
[1:01:39] Ultimate Surrender you come to the point
[1:01:41] that Lord I lay everything
[1:01:44] down Lord I give you
[1:01:47] everything and when you do that you can
[1:01:50] empty up before God and God will do some
[1:01:52] things in your life that you never
[1:01:54] thought or never even consider because
[1:01:57] that's what God wants he wants that
[1:01:59] willing vessel he wants that person to
[1:02:01] come to him and say Lord I surrender all
[1:02:04] amen Lord I give you everything even my
[1:02:08] dreams my vision and my
[1:02:11] plans the things that I thought I was
[1:02:13] going to accomplish Lord I give that to
[1:02:15] you too amen even the things that I see
[1:02:18] that I think that you leading me towards
[1:02:21] Lord I give that to you
[1:02:23] too and when you come to that place you
[1:02:26] willing and willing to say Lord whatever
[1:02:28] you ask of me I'll do amen see sometimes
[1:02:32] you might not want that because it's
[1:02:34] going to take you to some places and
[1:02:36] things that you ain't want to
[1:02:38] go it was going to take you through some
[1:02:40] things that you that you can already see
[1:02:43] that's why you trying to be like Jonah
[1:02:44] you hopping on the ship to run
[1:02:48] away because it's places and things that
[1:02:50] you don't want to face but in order for
[1:02:53] you to get to where God wants you to go
[1:02:55] you got to face face it you got to face
[1:02:58] it and you got to face it head on ain't
[1:03:00] noing to trying to Sid step
[1:03:03] it cuz you got to face that cuz God
[1:03:06] wants to do something and he got to he
[1:03:08] got to take you through it in order for
[1:03:10] him to work he got to take you through
[1:03:12] it see it's about your reaction in this
[1:03:16] trial it's about your reaction when the
[1:03:19] test comes it's about your reaction and
[1:03:21] just know that God will bring you
[1:03:23] through it he hears every prayer that
[1:03:26] you
[1:03:27] pray he hears every tear he sees every
[1:03:31] tear that you
[1:03:32] cry he here and he knows what you going
[1:03:36] through he knows
[1:03:38] it and he's able to bring you through
[1:03:41] it and always know that it's going to
[1:03:44] work together for the good for the good
[1:03:48] and see I I can't tell you that it's got
[1:03:51] to become a revelation to
[1:03:54] you it's got to be something that you
[1:03:56] believe so deep down in your heart that
[1:03:58] nobody can push you to the right or push
[1:04:01] you to the left because you believe it
[1:04:04] it's a faith thing that has matched and
[1:04:06] that scripture done become so real to
[1:04:08] you it done become like that amen and
[1:04:10] you can stand on it so firm that when
[1:04:13] others come and things come and the
[1:04:15] devil hits your mind you can still
[1:04:17] believe Lord all things work together to
[1:04:20] the good I'm not just quoting this no
[1:04:22] more and the devil can't convince me
[1:04:24] that it's not true amen amen amen the
[1:04:26] devil can't convince me that I'm just
[1:04:28] hoping maybe might be I
[1:04:32] hope it's a faith there that has
[1:04:35] elevated to a certain point and to a
[1:04:37] certain level that I know that God is
[1:04:39] real that that might be the only
[1:04:41] scripture that I may know but I'm
[1:04:43] holding on to that one amen that might
[1:04:45] be the only scripture that I heard but
[1:04:47] I'm holding on to that one amen amen and
[1:04:49] I can hold on and I tell you if you hold
[1:04:52] on to that one he going to send another
[1:04:53] one and you going to be able to hold on
[1:04:55] to that one he going to send another one
[1:04:57] you going to be able to hold next thing
[1:04:58] you know you got a whole bunch of ones
[1:05:00] that when the testing trial come you say
[1:05:03] uhuh cuz I got a revelation that God has
[1:05:06] done what he said he was going to do so
[1:05:08] if he done it before he can do it again
[1:05:10] amen and I know that he going to bring
[1:05:12] me through no matter how hard and how
[1:05:14] how perilous it may seem God will do it
[1:05:18] amen if I trust him and I believe he'll
[1:05:21] do it amen and I can stand on it and it
[1:05:24] might not be easy but can stand on it
[1:05:26] see I got faith that I can stand on it I
[1:05:29] got faith that I know God is real that I
[1:05:32] know his word is true and I can stand on
[1:05:34] it I don't care who says it's not and
[1:05:37] who says it isn't but I can stand on it
[1:05:40] cuz I can't give them a revelation that
[1:05:42] God gave to me amen I can't convince you
[1:05:45] what I know to be true cuz it might be
[1:05:47] by
[1:05:49] Revelation and some will see it and some
[1:05:51] will not but I can't convince you of it
[1:05:55] but if I know know that it's true it's
[1:05:56] because God has showed me am and see you
[1:05:59] got to have those experience for
[1:06:00] yourself because things may come that
[1:06:03] try to shake your faith things may come
[1:06:06] that try to get you to swing left or
[1:06:09] right but you know that when God is real
[1:06:11] he'll show you all thing all true he'll
[1:06:14] show it to you and you can ask him he
[1:06:16] said those that seek after after
[1:06:18] righteousness they shall be filled and
[1:06:21] see God will do the do the things that
[1:06:23] you asked him to do all you got to do is
[1:06:25] have the right
[1:06:27] reaction you got to believe that God can
[1:06:29] bring you through and he will do what he
[1:06:32] said he will
[1:06:34] [Applause]
[1:06:48] do man you appreciate the word tonight
[1:06:51] amen amen God is good amen you know I
[1:06:54] was thinking about your reaction I was
[1:06:57] thinking when brother Caleb was
[1:06:58] preaching ton night I was sitting there
[1:07:00] talking with the children last night was
[1:07:03] kind of having a little bible study went
[1:07:05] on for a little while but I I was
[1:07:07] telling them I said you know it's
[1:07:10] something about Israel and after God
[1:07:14] brought them out in such a mighty way
[1:07:17] and uh it they could have he could have
[1:07:19] brought him another way other than the
[1:07:20] Red Sea but geographically speaking but
[1:07:24] he brought him that way
[1:07:26] and and he took him through so much and
[1:07:28] it was that should have built a trust in
[1:07:33] him that God you know you can do all
[1:07:36] things I says but the thing is every
[1:07:39] time things got a little
[1:07:41] hard out there in in the wilderness
[1:07:44] every time situations got a little bit
[1:07:47] hard their reaction was we want to go
[1:07:50] back to
[1:07:52] Egypt they didn't want to go through
[1:07:54] nothing
[1:07:55] but I says after all God did for them
[1:07:59] when the thing when it seems to get a
[1:08:00] little hard that's what their reaction
[1:08:03] was but I says the thing is you know I
[1:08:07] was telling Moses last night I said you
[1:08:09] know it's something happened to me
[1:08:12] before when I when the Lord saved me and
[1:08:16] I said and from then I know that when I
[1:08:20] hear that voice I know what that voice
[1:08:23] is I says when when when this I feel
[1:08:26] that presence I know what that is I said
[1:08:29] sometimes I might think was that God or
[1:08:32] was this God I says but it's
[1:08:35] something that from the first time even
[1:08:38] until this day when I hear
[1:08:41] that voice I know without the shadow of
[1:08:45] a doubt that that's God I said and you
[1:08:49] as an individual I was talking to Moses
[1:08:51] last night cuz he was asking me you know
[1:08:56] will everybody speak in tongues and
[1:08:58] things like that and I share sharing
[1:09:01] what I think I said the biggest thing is
[1:09:04] even above the gifts of the Spirit you
[1:09:07] got to know God's voice you got to have
[1:09:11] an experience with God that from that
[1:09:15] time all of your life you'll know it
[1:09:18] when you when you hear it again and I
[1:09:20] said that's what's going to make the
[1:09:22] difference and that's what a lot of
[1:09:24] people don't never EXP
[1:09:26] experiened then when the when the hard
[1:09:28] Trials come just like our brother Kell
[1:09:30] was saying they don't know that
[1:09:33] voice they don't know that as I was
[1:09:35] praying the other day certain one thing
[1:09:37] I said Lord these these trials and these
[1:09:41] things that we're going through we look
[1:09:44] at them as being great and major I said
[1:09:47] but they small in your
[1:09:49] sight reason I said that is
[1:09:53] because God can do anything amen and
[1:09:56] everything he owns every cattle on the
[1:09:58] hill he's got all power in his
[1:10:01] hands but I said that to myself I said
[1:10:05] Lord these things are small in your
[1:10:09] sight I said what what can I do to just
[1:10:13] be pleasing in your sight at all
[1:10:16] times that was my prayer the other
[1:10:18] morning I said you know cuz cuz the
[1:10:21] thing is we forget that sometimes but I
[1:10:25] I said Lord what these things are small
[1:10:27] in your sight I said what can I do to be
[1:10:31] pleasing in in your eyes at all times
[1:10:35] that's what I want is that what you want
[1:10:37] tonight so God takes you through those
[1:10:41] things but remember those things are
[1:10:44] small and your trials just like Daniel
[1:10:47] and and he went down the Lion's then God
[1:10:50] kept them that was small in God's sight
[1:10:53] well I say small when I say small I'm
[1:10:55] looking at it that these trials and
[1:10:58] these tests if you know who God is
[1:11:00] they'll be they'll become small to you
[1:11:02] too reason being God is teaching moving
[1:11:06] us you know and changing us from glory
[1:11:09] to glory from level to level but your
[1:11:13] faith is solidified in him knowing I
[1:11:16] know the God on whom I'm serve amen I
[1:11:19] met him one day for myself and that's
[1:11:22] what's been keeping me through the ups
[1:11:24] through the downs
[1:11:26] through what you go through sometimes we
[1:11:28] bring upon ourself inflicted
[1:11:31] wounds it ain't all that is God fault
[1:11:35] sometimes we do things to ourselves but
[1:11:37] yet God will be there many of times to
[1:11:41] help get us through it but I just say
[1:11:44] tonight your reaction what is your
[1:11:47] reaction when you face with a present
[1:11:48] day tribe what is your reaction right
[1:11:51] now what is your reaction have you met
[1:11:54] God for yourself s cuz that's what it's
[1:11:57] going to take you know a personal
[1:12:00] experience and once you met that voice
[1:12:04] as I was talking with them last night in
[1:12:06] the in the home I says the thing is once
[1:12:10] you go on there you'll never be the same
[1:12:12] I said Moses had a wife and children all
[1:12:16] but when he went into that presence his
[1:12:18] whole life was changed and from that
[1:12:20] time he stepped into that presence for
[1:12:24] until his life was over over
[1:12:26] with he never could get away from that
[1:12:29] experience that he had with God and
[1:12:31] that's how God wants to meet you
[1:12:35] today God wants to be in your life that
[1:12:38] same way to where your life is changed
[1:12:42] in such a way that you'll never be the
[1:12:45] same no matter who goes back no matter
[1:12:48] who walks away no matter who says what
[1:12:50] through the ups through the Downs
[1:12:53] something happened to you one day from
[1:12:55] that time you never were the same and
[1:12:59] you'll never be the same because God has
[1:13:02] came back to redeem that part of you
[1:13:06] amen
