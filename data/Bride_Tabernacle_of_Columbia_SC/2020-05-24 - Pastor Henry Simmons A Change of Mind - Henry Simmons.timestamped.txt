[34:57] present in the spirit
[34:59] we thank you for being with us over the
[35:02] airways
[35:05] romans 12 and 1 it says i beseech you
[35:09] therefore brethren by the mercies
[35:11] of god that you present your body is a
[35:15] living sacrifice holy and acceptable to
[35:17] god
[35:18] which is your reasonable service be not
[35:21] conformed to the world
[35:23] but be transformed by the renewing of
[35:26] your mind that you may prove what is the
[35:27] good
[35:28] acceptable perfect will of god
[35:32] this morning we want to talk about a new
[35:34] mind
[35:36] just praying this morning and said lord
[35:38] what would you have us to say
[35:42] and uh
[35:46] we looked at the world today in the
[35:48] condition of the mind
[35:51] set up mankind and
[35:54] really know that man
[35:58] mind has deteriorated
[36:03] and when we think of the mind
[36:07] we think of
[36:12] the mental condition of mankind
[36:16] and the spiritual condition of mankind
[36:21] i said
[36:25] god saw the need that
[36:29] he put it in romans that we be not
[36:31] conformed to this world
[36:35] but that we be transformed by the
[36:37] renewing
[36:38] of our minds
[36:41] i believe that
[36:44] in the beginning when god
[36:48] created man in his own image in his own
[36:51] likeness
[36:53] the man mine
[36:58] was a holy man
[37:01] god man man and man was
[37:05] so much like god
[37:09] he was able to name the animals
[37:15] he had a mind
[37:18] just like god's mind
[37:23] but i want you to know that
[37:27] somehow lucifer
[37:31] when he was in heaven according to
[37:34] isaiah
[37:36] 14 lucifer
[37:40] being in heaven had
[37:43] his own mind
[37:47] he wanted to
[37:51] take over heaven the bible says that
[37:56] in isaiah 14 that
[38:01] in 12 he said have thou fallen from
[38:04] heaven all lucifer
[38:07] son of the mourning how are thou cut
[38:09] down to the ground
[38:11] which did weaken the nation for thou has
[38:15] said in thy heart
[38:16] i will send into heaven
[38:19] and i will exalt my throne
[38:23] above the stars of god and i will
[38:26] set also in the mountain of the
[38:30] congregation
[38:31] in the sides of the north
[38:35] satan thoughts
[38:40] amen was to take
[38:43] over god's throne
[38:47] and i believe that satan because he
[38:51] could not
[38:52] conquer in heaven
[38:55] that he came to the earth
[38:59] if we are not count for the day
[39:04] we'll be caught up
[39:07] with satan
[39:10] the eden that god created was a holy
[39:14] eden
[39:16] the man the god created was a holy man
[39:23] but satan had a desire
[39:26] in his heart lucifer wanted
[39:31] he meant man to worship him
[39:37] the bible tells us in matthew 24
[39:41] 24
[39:44] for there shall arise false
[39:47] christs and false prophets
[39:52] and shall show great signs and oneness
[39:56] and so much that if it were possible
[40:00] they shall deceive the very lake
[40:04] there is an enemy on the prowl
[40:09] the devil is after your mind
[40:13] the steel the mind
[40:17] if he has your mind he can get you to do
[40:21] his desires and his will
[40:24] and to worship him
[40:28] the bible tells us lucifer was not
[40:32] successful
[40:34] in heaven and because of
[40:37] his not being successful in heaven
[40:41] he brought it into the garden of eden
[40:45] where mankind
[40:49] was innocent we call it the dispersation
[40:52] of innocence
[40:55] and in the dispersation of innocent
[40:59] man did not know the bible said
[41:05] man wasn't conscious
[41:09] of lust and
[41:12] he was not conscious
[41:15] of that he was naked
[41:19] because god had veiled him
[41:22] with a holy veil
[41:25] and man did not know he was naked
[41:31] but i want you to know in the period of
[41:34] innocence satan amen
[41:39] want to disturb god's holiness
[41:44] satan amen had a desire
[41:47] to creep in the bible said
[41:51] it was the possible he'll deceive
[41:55] even the very elect
[41:58] satan have a desire
[42:02] to receive mankind
[42:06] he deceived eve in the beginning
[42:10] and he's seeking the disease amen
[42:14] every one that lives on the face of the
[42:18] earth
[42:20] that calls all small and great
[42:23] rich and poor to wash up
[42:27] the beast and receive
[42:30] his mark amen his desire
[42:34] even mankind to turn to him
[42:40] but god
[42:44] you and i a new mind
[42:49] that mind only comes
[42:52] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:56] without the holy ghost amen your mind
[43:00] would be corrupt
[43:04] ii thessalonians 2 and 4
[43:08] it tells us satan desire
[43:14] he tells us in three verse three let no
[43:17] man deceive you
[43:19] amen by any means
[43:22] for that day should not come accept the
[43:25] come
[43:26] of fallen away first
[43:29] and that man of sin be revealed
[43:34] the son of prediction
[43:40] judas
[43:43] was the son of perdition
[43:48] there is a man that's on
[43:52] the way coming
[43:56] but they are the spirit that's in the
[43:58] world today
[44:01] and that spirit is to get you ready
[44:05] for the man that's coming
[44:08] the man of sin
[44:12] he sent forth his demon
[44:16] powers of deception
[44:19] to catch the minds
[44:23] of the people that don't believe
[44:26] god's word
[44:29] and to corrupt their minds he's not only
[44:33] doing
[44:34] it through drugs and violence
[44:38] and lust but he also has a mind
[44:43] to take over where god's throne is
[44:49] he wants god's throne
[44:54] say to those amen
[44:58] he wants to work with your head that he
[45:01] can get to your heart
[45:04] his whole motive and objective is
[45:07] amen if i can get your mind i'm gonna
[45:11] get you hard and i'm gonna cause your
[45:14] soul
[45:14] to be lost
[45:20] are you with me
[45:23] so here he says
[45:27] who opposes and exalt himself above all
[45:32] that is called god
[45:35] uh that is worship
[45:39] so that he as god
[45:42] set it in the temple of god
[45:46] the bible tells us your body is the
[45:49] temper
[45:50] of the holy ghost
[45:54] satan wants to take the holy ghost's
[45:58] place
[46:01] satan want to take over amen
[46:04] god's house and he wants to be
[46:09] the one that's worshipped
[46:14] you following me satan won't
[46:18] worship but how
[46:22] is he god do it he creates into
[46:25] the church with his programs
[46:30] his money schemes
[46:33] he looks like he's helping you
[46:36] but all the time is a deceptive plan
[46:41] does enough good that he can creep
[46:45] in and make you think that he's
[46:48] all right that's what man
[46:52] looks at good works and because of good
[46:56] works the man does
[46:59] do he think that because of my works
[47:03] i'm saved but if we said
[47:07] last week we'll save by grace
[47:10] through faith and not of works least any
[47:14] man
[47:15] shall boast it doesn't matter
[47:18] how much work you do for the lord
[47:22] salvation is of the lord
[47:26] amen god is the only savior
[47:30] and without jesus coming
[47:33] to get us out of our central condition i
[47:38] said the reason
[47:39] he died is before your
[47:42] sins and for my sins
[47:46] jesus laid down his life
[47:49] that he could give you his life
[47:53] he made himself sin
[47:57] that we might be made the righteousness
[48:00] of god
[48:01] in him so i'm going to say
[48:04] my brothers and sisters amen
[48:08] be not conformed to this world
[48:11] but be transformed by the renewing
[48:15] of your mind you need
[48:19] the mind of christ we need
[48:22] the holy ghost we need
[48:25] the power of god to transform
[48:29] our minds
[48:33] so satan wants to take over the temple
[48:36] he wants to be in the temple satan wants
[48:40] your heart brother sister
[48:43] satan won't say amen if he can get in
[48:46] there
[48:47] amen and get your heart and your desires
[48:51] amen to be sent for he wants amen
[48:55] to blind you
[48:59] showing himself that he is gone
[49:02] people have been blind
[49:06] by doing good works
[49:09] being religious helping the pope
[49:13] amen doing a little thing nothing wrong
[49:16] with
[49:17] it we ought to do that amen we are
[49:20] to help in the community
[49:24] but salvation is not based upon
[49:27] what we do salvation is based upon
[49:31] jesus blood and his blood alone
[49:36] it's what he died to purchase the church
[49:39] with his own blood salvation
[49:44] comes only through jesus christ
[49:48] brother sister you got to look
[49:52] at what jesus has done for you
[49:56] and you got to believe that he died
[50:00] to set my soul free that i can have
[50:04] a new mind my thinking is off
[50:09] amen i can't justify myself
[50:14] amen all our righteousness
[50:17] this filthy rise that is in me
[50:22] pulse in me that is in my flesh
[50:26] it was no good thing
[50:30] i ain't no good you
[50:33] are no good the only one that's
[50:37] good is god and we need
[50:41] god in order for god
[50:45] to justify us to sacrifice
[50:49] oh yes we need god
[50:52] in the temple
[50:55] say your body is the temple
[51:00] of the holy ghost we need the holy ghost
[51:07] i want to get a little farther up the
[51:10] road
[51:12] satan is sitting in the church people
[51:15] walking themselves
[51:18] we might use the phrase they're working
[51:20] themselves to death
[51:23] churches are getting bigger they're
[51:26] raising more money than ever
[51:29] they met the preachers they meant their
[51:32] driving the bless
[51:34] they're living in the best neighborhoods
[51:37] they have
[51:38] jet planes people are doing swell
[51:42] the church look like in that day
[51:45] they men are very prosperous
[51:48] and unsuccessful i want you to know
[51:52] amen man looks on
[51:56] the outward appearance but god
[52:00] judges the heart god
[52:03] saw david the people wanted
[52:06] us all but god saw man
[52:10] that was at his own heart he wasn't much
[52:14] to look at
[52:15] but god saw in david not his outward
[52:20] appearance

[52:38] are not caught up with the art with the
[52:40] parents

[53:00] dog
[53:01] degree but i want to tell you
[53:05] amen we need somebody
[53:09] and that it doesn't matter whether they
[53:11] know the abc's
[53:14] whether whether or not they know jesus
[53:17] whether or not they meant they're
[53:19] baptized
[53:20] with the holy ghost whether or not the
[53:23] power of god
[53:25] is in the inside whether or not they're
[53:28] living
[53:28] according to the word
[53:32] we need god back in his temple
[53:36] we need god back in his people
[53:39] we need god on the inside
[53:44] brother sister we need to pray
[53:48] until god could come in his temple
[53:51] we need to pray that god can control
[53:55] and have preeminence in his temple
[53:58] let god come into your life
[54:02] and let it fill the temple with his
[54:05] holiness
[54:07] and his righteousness
[54:10] we need to repent
[54:14] of our sins and recognize
[54:18] that what we think of ourselves doesn't
[54:22] matter
[54:24] is what the word says that matters the
[54:28] most
[54:30] every man thinks himself
[54:33] amen the bible said as a weed
[54:36] that seemed right to a man amen but
[54:40] that's not
[54:40] god's way he said your thoughts
[54:44] are not my thoughts and your ways
[54:49] are not my way i want you to know
[54:52] that god has a way
[54:55] god wants you amen
[54:58] to be filled with his spirit
[55:02] god wants us to come in to your heart
[55:06] god wants you he meant to accept jesus
[55:10] as your lord and as your savior
[55:13] not just withheld knowledge not with
[55:16] intellectual conception
[55:18] but god wants you to do it amen from the
[55:22] heart
[55:23] oh yes brother sister church won't do
[55:27] johnny church won't do you need the holy
[55:31] ghost of
[55:32] being a member of a church it won't do
[55:35] you need to repent
[55:39] and say god i need you in my life
[55:44] the bible says be not conformed to this
[55:48] world
[55:50] so the bible said all that is in the
[55:52] world
[55:53] is the lust of the flesh
[55:58] amen the lusts of the eyes and the pride
[56:02] of life
[56:04] these things are not of the father
[56:07] without
[56:08] the world god calling us
[56:12] to get away from our love veil
[56:16] and be veiled with the holy ghost fear
[56:21] god wants to take the scales
[56:25] from our eyes i just said
[56:31] in second corinthians 4
[56:35] there is a power that's sweeping the
[56:38] head
[56:40] that calls the man eyes to be blind
[56:45] not only are the eyes blind
[56:49] but satan has tapped
[56:53] with the ability amen
[56:56] to comprehend the things of god
[57:01] amen made them feel like everything is
[57:05] all right
[57:07] but down in the soul death is sitting
[57:10] there
[57:12] that's a worm of unbelief
[57:15] down in the soul of man it meant
[57:18] satan is there and satan needs to be
[57:22] rooted out
[57:23] of our lives we need amen to get to the
[57:27] root of the matter
[57:29] get down deep amen where you can get
[57:32] yourself out of the way
[57:35] amen because you don't think like god
[57:38] i don't care how intelligent you are
[57:41] amen you're not god amen
[57:45] you can't think like god you can't be
[57:48] like god
[57:50] even only god can identify himself
[57:54] by his own characteristics you can't
[57:58] love
[57:58] like god amen you can't live like god
[58:02] but you got to let god live
[58:05] in you until god karma
[58:08] in his holy temple and take control of
[58:12] your life
[58:13] you'll never be able to live right
[58:16] you'll never be able to talk right
[58:20] or you would me i want to say
[58:25] you can't think right your thinking is
[58:29] off
[58:31] your thinking is off
[58:34] you need a new mind
[58:37] folks are gone and they've gotten face
[58:41] to live
[58:42] folk they've gotten new knew this and
[58:46] knew that
[58:48] amen but you need a new mind
[58:51] and without that new mind
[58:55] you're in bad shape i'm in bad shape
[58:58] but god wants to give you a new mind
[59:01] amen the only way the doctors can't do
[59:04] it
[59:05] the psychiatrist can't do it the
[59:08] neurologists
[59:09] can't do it amen the plastic surgeons
[59:13] can't do it
[59:15] they can make it look good on the
[59:17] outside
[59:19] but the inside amen
[59:22] they can't fix the inside they can tall
[59:25] a little bit
[59:27] amen and get you away from things that
[59:30] trying to destroy you and psychology
[59:34] and philosophy amen won't work
[59:38] you need to let god come in
[59:42] and give you perfect peace whose mind
[59:46] is stand on him god wants to help you
[59:50] but while you're willing to come to god
[59:54] and let god fix it for you
[59:59] let me say this
[1:00:06] he said in the third verse of second
[1:00:09] corinthians
[1:00:11] but if our gospel would be it's here to
[1:00:14] them that are lost
[1:00:18] some people don't understand
[1:00:22] that the gospel is healed from them
[1:00:26] but because they're lost go to church
[1:00:29] yes
[1:00:31] preach in the pulpit yes but if our
[1:00:35] gospel will be heard
[1:00:37] it's here to them that allows
[1:00:40] the bible says whom the god of this
[1:00:43] world
[1:00:45] has blinded the mind of them that
[1:00:48] believe
[1:00:49] not least the light of the glorious
[1:00:53] gospel of christ
[1:00:55] who is the image of god to shine
[1:00:59] to them
[1:01:03] are y'all with me
[1:01:08] for we preach not ourselves
[1:01:12] amen but christ jesus the lord
[1:01:16] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[1:01:18] sake
[1:01:20] for god who commanded the light the
[1:01:23] shine out of darkness
[1:01:25] has shined in our hearts to give the
[1:01:28] light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:01:30] of god in the face
[1:01:34] of jesus christ jesus christ
[1:01:38] today the bible says in revelation in my
[1:01:42] conclusion this morning
[1:01:45] i said man was innocent in the beginning
[1:01:49] in the end innocent covet with the holy
[1:01:53] veil
[1:01:55] covered by the holy spirit
[1:01:59] did not know he was naked
[1:02:02] but in the end
[1:02:06] in revelation as we conclude today
[1:02:10] revelation 3 tells us
[1:02:14] in 17
[1:02:18] because thou says i'm rich
[1:02:21] i'm increased with good i have neither
[1:02:25] nothing
[1:02:26] nor is not the die of wretch
[1:02:30] miserable poor blind
[1:02:33] and naked north not
[1:02:38] mandate does not know
[1:02:42] i believe john was writing to the church
[1:02:46] the rich church the church
[1:02:50] that was in a condition
[1:02:53] that would call spiritual blindness
[1:02:59] spiritually naked
[1:03:03] naturally rich
[1:03:07] naturally they have achieved
[1:03:10] leaps and bounds
[1:03:13] prosper naturally but
[1:03:16] spiritually they were bereaved
[1:03:20] they had put jesus on the outside
[1:03:24] of the door of the church he was
[1:03:27] knocking on the door
[1:03:29] of the church couldn't get in
[1:03:32] because the church has grown
[1:03:35] prosperous the people
[1:03:39] that were going to the church was the
[1:03:42] upper class
[1:03:43] in the best of the city
[1:03:46] the poor and the knee
[1:03:50] was despised and rejected
[1:03:54] perhaps they would give them a crumb
[1:03:57] here and there what hill
[1:04:03] church has been successful
[1:04:07] to the outside view but the
[1:04:10] inside
[1:04:14] they were naked the less
[1:04:18] veil has taken over as it is taken over
[1:04:22] the streets
[1:04:24] of columbia taking over the streets
[1:04:28] of america left
[1:04:32] is everywhere people are naked
[1:04:38] and the thing is they don't know
[1:04:41] it because there is a lust
[1:04:45] veil that have coveted them
[1:04:50] satan has created his own
[1:04:54] eating and his it has eaten
[1:04:59] that an eaten that is full
[1:05:03] of lust
[1:05:07] and fleshly desires
[1:05:10] people are continuing on
[1:05:14] pleasing their own flesh
[1:05:17] cleaving their own self
[1:05:21] but jesus said let the spine be in you
[1:05:26] that was also in christ
[1:05:29] who being in the form of god
[1:05:32] thought it not rivalry to be equal with
[1:05:36] god
[1:05:37] but made of himself a new reputation
[1:05:42] the mind of god
[1:05:46] jesus had a mind to do the will
[1:05:50] of god jesus had a mind
[1:05:54] to please god i want you to know
[1:05:58] that your mind and your will and your
[1:06:02] desire
[1:06:03] ought to be i want to please you jesus
[1:06:07] lord not my will
[1:06:10] but i want your will to be done in my
[1:06:13] life
[1:06:15] i wonder jesus amen will
[1:06:18] to be done in my life how many
[1:06:23] have successfully pleased the church
[1:06:28] please the preacher would not please god
