[1:09:16] I know that it is finished.
[1:09:22] I will not boast in anything,
[1:09:28] nor gifts, nor power, no wisdom.
[1:09:34] Why should I gain from this reward?
[1:09:40] I gave my life no answer.
[1:09:45] Why should I gain from this reward?
[1:09:51] I may not give an answer,
[1:09:57] but this I know with through my heart.
[1:10:03] His wounds have paid my ransom.
[1:10:08] Why should I gain from this reward?
[1:10:14] I may not give an answer,
[1:10:20] but these I know with all my heart.
[1:10:26] His wounds have paid my ransom.
[1:10:33] Praise God.
[1:10:35] Hallelujah.
[1:10:37] Praise God.
[1:10:40] Amen. I want to uh give special thanks
[1:10:44] to brother Simmons to invite me to these
[1:10:47] meetings.
[1:10:49] I came to know brother Simmons through
[1:10:52] uh brother David and sister Hana, the
[1:10:55] one who was testifying yesterday.
[1:10:58] Amen. And one day I I was in their
[1:11:00] house. I went there and you know
[1:11:04] they've kept their house with such an
[1:11:06] atmosphere. You know you enter a house
[1:11:10] um they they play that music which we
[1:11:14] play in meditation time just an
[1:11:16] atmosphere in the house. I enter the
[1:11:18] house, I said, "Wow, there are angels
[1:11:20] here." And then there was like they said
[1:11:24] a mist appeared just the moment I spoke
[1:11:27] that and God confirmed his presence in
[1:11:30] that home. I also met saw someone
[1:11:33] received the Holy Ghost right in the
[1:11:35] sitting room.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's where I met brother
[1:11:40] Simmons in and and he came there when I
[1:11:43] was there. So I thought surely for them
[1:11:47] to introduce me to him and if uh people
[1:11:51] he she says he's like my father figure
[1:11:54] if the daughter is like that what will
[1:11:56] be the daddy. Praise God. Amen.
[1:11:59] Oh I really appreciate uh what God is
[1:12:03] doing in their life and you know it was
[1:12:05] strange to come to us where you know
[1:12:08] there's too much sin then you find such
[1:12:10] people where God is vindicating himself.
[1:12:12] Amen. I was encouraged by the
[1:12:15] testimonies yesterday. And just to tell
[1:12:17] you a little bit more, there was a time
[1:12:19] I was with a brother in Africa. He's got
[1:12:22] a prophetic gift. I went to pick him up
[1:12:23] so that we go and pray for someone who
[1:12:25] had demons.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; And then this brother didn't tell me
[1:12:29] that he wasn't ready for the task. So we
[1:12:33] started out, we were going then I told
[1:12:34] him there's a sister in America who
[1:12:37] called and miss. I should have called
[1:12:39] her back. Then he says a voice dead told
[1:12:41] him tell him to call that sister right
[1:12:43] now. So we were just a few blocks from
[1:12:45] where we were going and I I I he told me
[1:12:48] can you call her normally I should have
[1:12:50] said no no no need let's first finish
[1:12:53] the job then we can talk to her but I
[1:12:55] decided to call her and the moment she
[1:12:57] responded you know it was in speaker and
[1:13:00] this brother just says wow this sister
[1:13:03] is anointed and he went in tongues. So I
[1:13:06] said I I was telling her, "Sorry,
[1:13:08] there's somebody in the car that's
[1:13:10] speaking in tongues right now." So she
[1:13:12] says, "I want to greet him." I said,
[1:13:13] "No, you can't. He's under anointing."
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; So we reached and then they finally
[1:13:18] talked and then uh he he calmed down and
[1:13:21] he told the sister, he says, "I see you
[1:13:23] right now. You're driving and there's an
[1:13:26] angel in the car seated with you."
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; And and she confirmed. She says, "I knew
[1:13:31] that there was an angel because there
[1:13:33] was such a good atmosphere in the car
[1:13:35] and and how I knew there was an angel."
[1:13:37] And when Michael told him told her that,
[1:13:40] we finished. We went to this deliverance
[1:13:42] session and we prayed. The the sister
[1:13:45] had over 500 demons.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But we don't care how many
[1:13:51] demons the person has. I don't care how
[1:13:53] many demons are operating in your life.
[1:13:56] Praise God. Amen. And we prayed and
[1:14:00] those demons were defeated. And after
[1:14:01] that, Michael told me to say, "Do you
[1:14:04] know that uh I wasn't ready for that
[1:14:07] task."
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; But when that sister said, "Hello,
[1:14:12] brother Jimmy." I managed to tap
[1:14:14] anointing from her to go and use for the
[1:14:17] deliverance.
[1:14:19] Hey, brother. If demons can travel on
[1:14:21] the phone or in the films,
[1:14:25] hey, if demons can travel on the movie,
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; the power of God can travel on a phone.
[1:14:33] Praise God.
[1:14:36] And when I saw what God is doing in her
[1:14:39] life, when I came to their home, I heard
[1:14:40] those testimonies. I said, "Wow." So the
[1:14:43] God that I preach still exists.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; It encouraged me more. So I was telling
[1:14:49] her like there were more testimonies. I
[1:14:52] I think I'm not a long-winded preacher.
[1:14:53] I can give her 5 10 minutes. She gives
[1:14:55] us maybe two more testimonies or three
[1:14:57] more. Sister Hannah, please you may you
[1:15:00] may just so that when when when the
[1:15:03] foundation is lit, we're going to fly.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you again.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to be here. And this is all
[1:15:17] about Jesus.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, sir.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; You know, someone asked me yesterday,
[1:15:24] where did you come from? I said, you
[1:15:26] know, I came from the island of
[1:15:28] Trinidad. My daddy was a pioneer of this
[1:15:30] message.
[1:15:32] One who took this gospel around the
[1:15:34] world and introduced the message to
[1:15:36] thousands and thousands of people.
[1:15:39] That's in the 60s.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; And I received the Holy Ghost at the age
[1:15:43] of 11 years old.
[1:15:46] And since then, I've been serving the
[1:15:48] Lord with my whole heart.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; He's my everything, Jesus.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; I've seen a God in my daddy's life. No
[1:15:55] demon stood before him. And I said,
[1:15:57] "Lord, I just want to be like him.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I want to be my like my heavenly father
[1:16:03] and my earthly father."
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; And you really heard my prayer.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; And I bring you greetings from Trinidad.
[1:16:10] My family said, "Greet the church for
[1:16:11] me."
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. There's so many
[1:16:15] testimonies, but I'll just be short,
[1:16:17] very long testimonies, but I'll just
[1:16:19] chop them up. I was driving my car. I
[1:16:22] had to go to the dealership one day and
[1:16:25] my husband um cleaned the battery poles
[1:16:28] and I had a limited time to reach to the
[1:16:30] dealership and I didn't know the time
[1:16:33] because the clock was you know messed up
[1:16:35] because there was no power
[1:16:39] and I was far a good way away from my
[1:16:41] house and I said Lord I don't have the
[1:16:43] time and the clock is not working and I
[1:16:45] forgot my watch on the dresser in my
[1:16:48] house. I said Lord where is the God of
[1:16:50] William Brham?
[1:16:53] I need my watch, Lord. And when I spoke
[1:16:55] the word, the watch that was in my
[1:16:56] dresser, far away from me appeared on my
[1:16:59] wrist.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, God. You're still
[1:17:03] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:17:06] I prove him in so many, many, many, many
[1:17:09] ways.
[1:17:11] This is all about Jesus."
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Just a couple weeks ago,
[1:17:17] actually, there was a brother from Fort
[1:17:19] Lauderdale. He heard of all these
[1:17:21] testimonies and his son was very very
[1:17:24] sick. He would rip his clothes apart, go
[1:17:26] on the floor and just beat up himself
[1:17:28] and they had to buy the house down
[1:17:30] because it was a very very terrible
[1:17:32] demons that attacked him and there was
[1:17:34] no cure for him. Absolutely. They went
[1:17:37] to all the doctors they could have.
[1:17:39] Nothing could have cured that child. And
[1:17:41] the dad called, he said, "Can you pray
[1:17:43] for my son?" I said, "Yes, just bring
[1:17:44] him up." To make the long story short,
[1:17:47] he was in the back of the church and he
[1:17:49] stood like about there. He wouldn't
[1:17:50] come. And the daddy said, "Come." And he
[1:17:52] would not come. I said, "Brother,
[1:17:53] there's no distance in prayer. He
[1:17:55] doesn't even have to be here."
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And I just I just raised my hand. I
[1:17:59] said, "Father, just touch that child.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Look how the devil has that poor
[1:18:04] innocent kid."
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; And I just left that prayer like that. I
[1:18:08] said, "Brother, in two days time, your
[1:18:09] son is going to be okay."
[1:18:12] Church, I stand here as a testimony. He
[1:18:15] came to church a few weeks ago and now
[1:18:18] he's flying airplane
[1:18:20] totally healed.
[1:18:22] Got the highest grades in school.
[1:18:26] Got a scholarship and he's all alone
[1:18:29] flying airplane. What Jesus did for that
[1:18:31] child.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; We deserve all the praise and honor and
[1:18:38] glory.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; I remember one day I was fasting at home
[1:18:42] and my husband was out of tongue.
[1:18:44] And I was in deep consecration before
[1:18:46] the Lord.
[1:18:49] That's my life. Just fast and pray.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; There's connect with Jesus.
[1:18:56] And I went to make a cup of tea. I was
[1:18:57] so weak. And I went to make a cup of tea
[1:18:59] and I said, "Oh, I have no milk."
[1:19:01] Because the cartoon was almost empty.
[1:19:03] And I I throw out a little drags of
[1:19:06] milk. And I said, "Father, I have no
[1:19:08] milk."
[1:19:09] And I'm so far away from the grocery
[1:19:11] store. And when I put the the container
[1:19:14] back, I heard the the milk just falling
[1:19:16] in the container.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, you're still the same
[1:19:21] yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Then I heard a knock at my door. I heard
[1:19:28] a knock on my door. A loud knock. I
[1:19:30] said, "Who is that?"
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And I opened the door and I went outside
[1:19:34] and there was eight big stack of milk in
[1:19:36] front my door. Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; It was the finest of the finest of the
[1:19:42] best of the milk.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you, eight stack of milk and I
[1:19:45] said, "Look, I said, "Hello. Hello. Is
[1:19:47] anybody here?" No one was there, but
[1:19:49] Jesus just rub all this milk there for
[1:19:51] me.
[1:19:53] I had so much milk and I had to share it
[1:19:55] around.
[1:19:58] That's my God.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; I love to talk about Jesus.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; He's my oxygen. I can't live without
[1:20:06] him.
[1:20:09] I give him all the praise, all the
[1:20:11] honor, and all the glory.
[1:20:13] I've seen I just put my hand in the
[1:20:15] blind man eyes, and the Lord give them
[1:20:18] 2020 vision.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; 2020 vision.
[1:20:23] I see so many blind eyes open, the deaf
[1:20:26] ear,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; the walk. Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I remember once
[1:20:32] in a Jimmy told me I could take a few
[1:20:34] minutes but I just be last. I was home
[1:20:37] and I was seeking the Lord and I got a
[1:20:39] call from a sister way in Trinidad and
[1:20:42] she said, "Sister Hannah, you remember
[1:20:43] me?" I said, "Yes, I do." She wanted a
[1:20:45] fridge and the the company wouldn't give
[1:20:48] her a fridge because she doesn't have a
[1:20:49] job
[1:20:51] and nobody wants to give her a fridge.
[1:20:52] And she said, "Can you pray for me?" I
[1:20:54] said, "Yes, you're going to get your
[1:20:55] fridge this week. You're going to get
[1:20:56] that fridge." They everybody denied her.
[1:20:58] And then she got a call. She said the
[1:21:01] company said, "I'm bringing the fridge
[1:21:02] for you without any money, no job,
[1:21:04] nothing." They brought the fridge to our
[1:21:06] house. She said, "The same God that gave
[1:21:10] me that fridge."
[1:21:12] She said, "Can you pray for my sister?
[1:21:14] She's dying in the hospital now. I'm
[1:21:16] millions of miles away from this
[1:21:17] sister."
[1:21:19] She said, "She's crippled. She has a
[1:21:21] stroke and she's twisted up. She can't
[1:21:23] walk. She can't talk.
[1:21:26] She can't do anything.
[1:21:29] I said, "Father,
[1:21:32] I'm sending the Holy Spirit in that
[1:21:34] hospital right now."
[1:21:37] I said, "Lord, I'm so far away, but
[1:21:40] there's no distance in prayer."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; I said, "Holy Spirit, go and arrest
[1:21:45] those demons
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; in that hospital."
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I said, "Sister, in 2 hours time, your
[1:21:51] sister is going to be home." Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Now her blood pressure was out of
[1:21:55] control and her blood sugar was out of
[1:21:57] control. The doctor went this way in the
[1:22:00] hospital. Then he came back this way. He
[1:22:02] said, "Weren't you crippled?
[1:22:06] Weren't you crippled? Weren't your blood
[1:22:08] pressure so much?" And the sister was up
[1:22:10] and jumping up. He he discharged her 2
[1:22:12] hours. Exactly 2 hours home she was
[1:22:15] home.
[1:22:17] Exactly 2 hours
[1:22:21] she went in a neighborhood.
[1:22:24] She took a weed eater and she started
[1:22:26] cutting the grass. Now all the neighbors
[1:22:28] know this woman is going to die. They
[1:22:30] say, "What happened to you?" She said,
[1:22:32] "Jesus healed me.
[1:22:36] That's the same God I serve.
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:40] He's still the same yesterday, today,
[1:22:42] and forever."
[1:22:46] And another sister heard about it and
[1:22:47] she had a disease in her foot and I she
[1:22:50] said, "Can you pray for me?" I said,
[1:22:52] "Sure." And I kneel down. The anointing
[1:22:54] was so strong.
[1:22:56] She just stand here and I tell you
[1:22:58] nothing but the truth. I have all the
[1:22:59] evidence in my phone and I can give you
[1:23:01] every number to call.
[1:23:03] And while I was crying, she said the
[1:23:06] tears from my eyes fell on her feet and
[1:23:08] it healed it instantly.
[1:23:10] I said, "Lord, your spit open the blind
[1:23:13] eyes
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:15] and I think I can heal the sick.
[1:23:18] Nothing is too hard for God to do."
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I remember once I was in a neighborhood
[1:23:24] and I supposed to go to a sister's house
[1:23:27] and I said, "Lord, I was I called her.
[1:23:29] Her name is Sharma. I said, "Honey, I'm
[1:23:31] coming over to your house." And it was a
[1:23:33] little ways from where I was. And I
[1:23:35] don't know what happened, but the Lord
[1:23:38] took my vehicle from this point to that
[1:23:41] point without driving. Church.
[1:23:45] I didn't drive the car.
[1:23:47] And she said, "Mama, how did you get
[1:23:49] here?" I said, "He brought me here."
[1:23:52] I said, "He did it in the Bible days
[1:23:56] and he can do it again."
[1:23:58] Jesus just took me up.
[1:24:01] He took me up from one port and just
[1:24:04] took me and my vehicle to the other
[1:24:06] side.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; I never drove it. I said, "Lord, how
[1:24:10] great God."
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:13] I remember a little baby in Africa was
[1:24:15] dying and the pastor, she said, he said,
[1:24:18] "Can you go pray for my baby?" And it
[1:24:20] was near the baby was almost dead and I
[1:24:23] couldn't go because there was a big
[1:24:25] glass because of the intensive care.
[1:24:27] We're in the jungles of Africa.
[1:24:30] And I say, "Satan, you're such a wimp
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; to attack a little child like that. That
[1:24:35] should show you have no power
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; because this baby is innocent." I said,
[1:24:39] "But you got to go. That death angel got
[1:24:42] to go tonight." I said, "Lord, all I'm
[1:24:44] asking for that child to be home in the
[1:24:46] morning." Church, I stand here. She was
[1:24:49] dismissed that that night and was home
[1:24:52] in the next morning. Totally blood
[1:24:55] transfusion.
[1:24:57] Jesus did a blood transfusion
[1:25:01] and healed a child
[1:25:03] and her blood was normal as normal could
[1:25:06] be.
[1:25:08] way in the jungles. A brother came. He
[1:25:11] came to me in a long prayer line. God,
[1:25:13] you're not you. You have to know your
[1:25:15] God when you go where the witches are.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And nobody would go there. The brother
[1:25:21] said, "No, no, no, no missionary comes.
[1:25:24] Only you alone came here. You and
[1:25:25] brother David." And while praying in the
[1:25:28] night, I heard such some noises. I said,
[1:25:30] "What's that?" I got up from the bed.
[1:25:32] There is grass roofs and stuff. A
[1:25:35] terrible place to be. Malaria
[1:25:37] everywhere.
[1:25:38] And I I heard the singing. They said,
[1:25:40] "Oh, the witches are out." I said,
[1:25:42] "Witches, you can't touch me. I know
[1:25:45] where I came from. I came from the
[1:25:46] presence of God.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And no devil in Africa can come against
[1:25:51] me because I know who I am.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I'm walking in power. I'm walking with
[1:25:56] authority."
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus, the whole of heaven is behind me.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Every sick person was healed. Hundreds
[1:26:05] and hundreds of people. The whole
[1:26:08] village came out
[1:26:10] and the Lord touched them all.
[1:26:13] There was a brother,
[1:26:16] the witches attack his foot and it was
[1:26:19] rotting and I went on my knees and I
[1:26:21] just touched his leg. I said, "Lord,
[1:26:25] just touch him, father." The next day
[1:26:27] was totally healed. God created the
[1:26:30] skin. He created the bones. He created
[1:26:33] the flesh.
[1:26:36] That's my God.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; He deserve all the praise,
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; all the honor
[1:26:44] and all the glory.
[1:26:47] I give him all the praise.
[1:26:50] I love him with all my heart. God bless
[1:26:54] you all. Thank you.
[1:26:56] Hallelujah.
[1:26:58] Come on, give him praise.
[1:27:00] Give him praise.
[1:27:03] Praise God. Amen. Let's stand. Give him
[1:27:06] praise.
[1:27:07] He's worthy of our praise.
[1:27:10] He's worthy. He's worthy. He's worthy.
[1:27:14] Hallelujah.
[1:27:17] Hallelujah.
[1:27:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:23] Jesus is here.
[1:27:26] The same Jesus is here. Oh, praise God.
[1:27:30] Amen.
[1:27:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We give him
[1:27:34] praise. We give him glory. We give him
[1:27:36] honor. I can feel his presence right
[1:27:40] now.
[1:27:42] I have three scriptures to read, but
[1:27:44] let's just read one while we standing
[1:27:46] and we go shooting. Amen. John 8 verse
[1:27:52] uh 3 uh 6. The other verses I'll just
[1:27:56] refer to them as I preach. If the Son
[1:27:59] therefore shall make you free, you shall
[1:28:02] be free indeed.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Let us pray. Heavenly
[1:28:07] Father, we've read the scripture. May
[1:28:09] you break the bread of life, Lord, to
[1:28:11] us. May you inspire these words, Lord,
[1:28:13] that we should experience your freedom.
[1:28:16] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[1:28:19] Praise God. Our title is experiencing
[1:28:23] God's freedom.
[1:28:25] We are here to experience God's freedom.
[1:28:29] We are here to experience the power of
[1:28:31] God. Why do we have to experience God's
[1:28:35] freedom? Praise God. Amen. Uh uh Isaiah
[1:28:40] 59:1 says, "The hand of God is not
[1:28:43] short."
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That it cannot save and uh his ear
[1:28:50] not down that they cannot hear. Praise
[1:28:53] God. Amen. I don't want to read the next
[1:28:55] verse because the next verse is
[1:28:57] judgment. Uh I'm not bringing judgment.
[1:28:59] Uh the next verse I'm not going to read
[1:29:01] it. I'll end on verse one. It says the
[1:29:04] hand of God is not short that it cannot
[1:29:08] save. Praise God. Amen. It wasn't short
[1:29:12] then. It's not short now. Praise God.
[1:29:16] Amen. We must experience the freedom
[1:29:19] that Jesus gives. The hand of God is not
[1:29:22] short that it cannot save. And Hebrews
[1:29:26] uh 12 uh verse one says, hallelujah,
[1:29:31] after all this cloud of witnesses, after
[1:29:34] this cloud of witnesses, after we see
[1:29:37] that the God that we are serving is
[1:29:39] real, after we see that the God we are
[1:29:42] serving is able to change your
[1:29:44] situation, what are we going to do? The
[1:29:47] Bible says, "Let us uh lay aside the sin
[1:29:50] that so easily beset us and let us run
[1:29:54] this race that is set before us." That's
[1:29:57] why you need God's freedom because
[1:29:59] there's a race that you must run. There
[1:30:02] are victories to be won. God wants to
[1:30:04] save you. But he also wants to use the
[1:30:08] potentials that he has put in you
[1:30:10] because there's a work of God that must
[1:30:12] be done. Hallelujah. I was wondering
[1:30:15] when I was preparing this sermon. I was
[1:30:17] like, am I on side? Am I bringing things
[1:30:19] that are strange? After I finished
[1:30:21] preparing it, brother Yadel is my
[1:30:23] witness. I wanted to watch what was
[1:30:26] preached. Hallelujah. In the youth
[1:30:28] meeting, I discovered brother Matias was
[1:30:31] saying the things that I'm right I'm
[1:30:33] saying right now. He was saying the
[1:30:35] things that were in in in my notes. I
[1:30:38] was telling him I was jumping in the
[1:30:40] room. I said, "Therefore, what I'm going
[1:30:43] to preach is God giving me because God
[1:30:46] has confirmed it already." And I
[1:30:48] realized that brother Caleb, who was
[1:30:51] supposed to preach next, was also
[1:30:53] preaching the same verse. I said, "Wow."
[1:30:56] So therefore, what I've brought tonight
[1:30:59] is actually thus, says the Lord. And
[1:31:03] when we are standing on that, say the
[1:31:05] Lord, brother, we are bold and we are
[1:31:08] strong and we are so sure that what we
[1:31:11] are saying is going to work out.
[1:31:14] Therefore, I put every spirit under my
[1:31:18] control to the glory of God. Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] I don't care how long you have lived in
[1:31:25] sin. I don't care how long you've lived
[1:31:28] in sickness. Praise God. Amen. The Bible
[1:31:32] says, "These signs shall follow them
[1:31:34] that believe. In my name, they shall
[1:31:36] cast out devils." We are going to cast
[1:31:39] out devils tonight. We are here to cast
[1:31:41] out devils tonight. I'm here to cast out
[1:31:44] devils. Hallelujah. Yes. Come on. The
[1:31:49] devil is in trouble. He's got to be on
[1:31:51] the run. Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:56] You know the devil is like a lion
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; roaming around roaring looking for
[1:32:02] someone that he can devour.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And you know the way the lion hunts it
[1:32:07] wants to be in ambush so that you don't
[1:32:10] see it. You know what the devil wants to
[1:32:12] tell you? He wants to tell you that the
[1:32:15] drug addiction that you have, it is your
[1:32:18] nature. He wants to tell you the wrong
[1:32:21] sexual orientation that you have, it is
[1:32:24] your nature. just uh somehow you being a
[1:32:27] man, you are being attracted to a man
[1:32:30] instead of a woman. The devil wants to
[1:32:32] tell you it's your nature. He wants to
[1:32:34] hide. Hallelujah. It is demon power.
[1:32:39] When I came in the states the night I
[1:32:41] was about to preach the following day in
[1:32:44] the night, I had a dream. I was entering
[1:32:46] a certain place and there was some uh uh
[1:32:49] witchcraft that was happening, some
[1:32:52] altar of sexual immorality and
[1:32:55] pornography and it attacked me. And then
[1:32:58] the dream I started saying, "Fire,
[1:33:00] fire." And I jumped out and I woke up. I
[1:33:02] said, "I know what I'm dealing with in
[1:33:04] the United States. We are going to pull
[1:33:06] the strongholds down." Hallelujah. Oh
[1:33:09] say praise God our weapons of our
[1:33:12] warfare are not cannon men of God right
[1:33:16] now what we are doing we are doing a lot
[1:33:18] of damage in the kingdom of darkness the
[1:33:21] devil has held you for so long maybe in
[1:33:24] watching pornography hallelujah the
[1:33:27] devil has held you for so long maybe in
[1:33:29] sin maybe in drug addiction maybe in the
[1:33:33] religious form of nature we know that
[1:33:35] demons can operate physically we call
[1:33:38] them diseases Jesus. We know that demons
[1:33:40] can operate in the spirit. We say
[1:33:42] oppression, opposition. We also know
[1:33:45] that demons can operate in the religious
[1:33:48] realm where they want to tell you that
[1:33:50] the days of miracles are passed. Those
[1:33:52] are demons in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:56] I declare you free tonight. I declare
[1:33:58] you free tonight. Receive your freedom.
[1:34:01] Receive your freedom. There is no reason
[1:34:05] why you should live in sin. no reason
[1:34:08] because the Bible in Isaiah 53 says he
[1:34:11] was wounded for our transgression. The
[1:34:14] chastisement of our peace laid upon his
[1:34:18] head and by his stripes we are healed.
[1:34:22] Therefore that scripture must be
[1:34:26] fulfilled so that we can say this day
[1:34:29] this scripture is fulfilled. Come on
[1:34:32] receive your freedom. Receive your
[1:34:35] freedom. Receive your deliverance.
[1:34:38] Hallelujah. Receive the power.
[1:34:41] Hallelujah. Receive it, my brother.
[1:34:44] Receive it, my sister. Jesus is here. He
[1:34:48] says, "Where two or three are gathered
[1:34:50] in my name, I'm in their midst." He does
[1:34:53] not come just to watch you. He does not
[1:34:56] come just to stand by. He comes because
[1:34:59] he knows that you have needs. Yes, your
[1:35:03] sin is great. Yes, your sin is great,
[1:35:07] but his grace is greater.
[1:35:10] His grace is greater than your sin.
[1:35:14] Hallelujah. The hand of God is not short
[1:35:18] that it can fail to reach you and reach
[1:35:20] you and reach you. Hallelujah. The long
[1:35:24] arm, the long arm of Jehovah is reaching
[1:35:29] you tonight. If you can only open your
[1:35:32] heart, there's no reason why you should
[1:35:34] live in sin because Jesus has paid the
[1:35:37] price. Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] You know it comes sometimes it comes
[1:35:41] like a thought. You think something
[1:35:43] wrong and you entertain it then you sin
[1:35:47] once then it becomes a stronghold.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Until a brother or a sister
[1:35:54] is in a cycle. Tomorrow you repent but
[1:35:57] you go back in your old ways. I
[1:36:00] appreciate brother Matias for preaching
[1:36:02] that message in the morning. Hallelujah.
[1:36:04] But there's a time when God, hallelujah,
[1:36:08] will get a hold of you because the long
[1:36:11] arm of Jehovah is going to get a hold of
[1:36:13] you. Some of you have been running from
[1:36:16] serving God. Some of you, you know you
[1:36:18] have a gift and you don't want it to
[1:36:20] operate. Hallelujah. I walked, I moved
[1:36:24] with a brother. We went somewhere and he
[1:36:26] told me, I have a gift. I had a gift. I
[1:36:29] could see visions. But it's like I
[1:36:31] dreamt the devil come and he he did
[1:36:34] something and I can't see visions no
[1:36:36] more. I said, "Don't worry." And I was
[1:36:38] preaching like this, just like this. And
[1:36:41] I spoke, receive your deliverance. And
[1:36:44] his eyes opened. Today, he sees visions
[1:36:47] over and over, back to back. Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] The devil may have bound your gift. The
[1:36:54] devil may have tempered with your
[1:36:56] ministry. The devil may have tempered
[1:36:58] with your ability, but I'm here to tell
[1:37:00] you tonight, receive your deliverance.
[1:37:04] Hallelujah. Receive the fire. Receive
[1:37:07] your freedom. I open your gift. I open
[1:37:10] your gift. I open your gift. I open your
[1:37:13] gift. Receive the fire. Receive the
[1:37:16] power. Receive the power. God is here,
[1:37:19] my brother. Hallelujah. The devil is in
[1:37:22] trouble in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:25] Every demon right now, get out in the
[1:37:27] name of Jesus. Out in the name of Jesus,
[1:37:30] you can be free. You can be free, my
[1:37:33] sister. You can be free, my brother.
[1:37:36] Hallelujah. All those addictions, today
[1:37:40] they are over. Today they are over. Why
[1:37:43] are you saying this, preacher man?
[1:37:45] Hallelujah, baby. The God with whom we
[1:37:49] have to do is the Lord Jesus.
[1:37:53] Hallelujah. He cannot fail.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; He says, He says he's a rewarder of they
[1:37:59] that diligently seek him. You have come
[1:38:02] seeking the Lord. You think your effort
[1:38:05] is in vain. No, no, no, no. It's not in
[1:38:08] vain because my Jesus, hallelujah, is a
[1:38:11] rewarder of they that seek him
[1:38:14] diligently. Hallelujah. The Bible says
[1:38:18] in Hebrews it says
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; for him to make sure the promise that he
[1:38:25] has given he swore by himself.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Blessing I'll bless you. Hallelujah. He
[1:38:34] swore by himself. He could not swear by
[1:38:36] no greater. He looked at Michael
[1:38:39] Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, you are
[1:38:41] great. You are a great Formula 1 driver
[1:38:44] but you're too small. I can swear on
[1:38:45] you. He looked at Muhammad Ali. He says,
[1:38:48] "You're the greatest boxer, but I can
[1:38:51] swear on you. You are too small."
[1:38:54] Hallelujah. Praise God. He says,
[1:38:56] "Alexander the Great. You are surely a
[1:38:58] great man." But he weighed him in the
[1:39:01] balance. He says, "Your greatness is not
[1:39:03] great enough." Therefore, he swore by
[1:39:07] himself.
[1:39:08] Hallelujah.
[1:39:11] But not only swearing, the Bible says he
[1:39:14] who promised,
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, can not lie.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; God can't lie.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; He can promise you something. And when
[1:39:25] you need salvation, he checks in his
[1:39:28] store and he finds salvation as
[1:39:30] finished. Then he runs away. Not my
[1:39:34] Jesus. God can't lie. You got to say
[1:39:39] that with me. God can't lie.
[1:39:44] Doesn't it sound good?
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; We can increase the speed. God can't
[1:39:49] lie. Yes. God lie.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can't lie. God can't lie.
[1:39:59] God can't lie. God can't lie. God can't
[1:40:03] lie. God can't lie. Hallelujah.
[1:40:07] Give him a cup of praise.
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:12] He can't lie.
[1:40:14] Hallelujah. He can't fail and he won't
[1:40:19] start now.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he healed then, he's
[1:40:24] going to heal now.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:28] God can't lie.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He promised in Acts chapter
[1:40:33] 2, he says, "Repent and be baptized
[1:40:37] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:40:40] Christ for the forgiveness of your
[1:40:44] sins." He did not say some sins but your
[1:40:48] sins. Whatever you may have done, Jesus
[1:40:52] is able to forgive you. Hallelujah. As
[1:40:55] long as you can humble yourself tonight
[1:40:57] and say, "Jesus, forgive me." He will
[1:41:00] forgive you. And when he forgives you,
[1:41:03] we are going to do one important thing.
[1:41:06] We'll baptize you in the name of Jesus
[1:41:09] Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.
[1:41:12] And then afterwards, you shall receive
[1:41:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:17] Hallelujah.
[1:41:19] How do you not preach a man? The Bible
[1:41:21] says, "For the promise
[1:41:23] is unto you in Jerusalem and to all that
[1:41:29] are far off even in South Carolina."
[1:41:32] Hallelujah. To stem who the Lord our God
[1:41:36] shall call. Is he still calling? Yes. On
[1:41:40] the 30th, August 30th, 2025,
[1:41:44] the Lord is still calling and his
[1:41:46] promise can never fail. He says you can
[1:41:49] receive the Holy Ghost. You say,
[1:41:51] "Preacher man, I've been in the message.
[1:41:53] I've been a believer for so long. I've
[1:41:55] never received the Holy Ghost." Oh, you
[1:41:57] are in the right grounds. You are in the
[1:42:00] right place where the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:02] falling. You say, "Preacher man, how wow
[1:42:05] Peter yet spake the Holy Ghost fell."
[1:42:08] And I can safely tell you as I'm
[1:42:11] preaching right now, h the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:14] falling. Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive
[1:42:17] the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:20] Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy
[1:42:22] Ghost. Oh, can you hear me? Can you hear
[1:42:25] me? Can you hear me? I'm saying receive
[1:42:27] the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:30] If there's nothing more that I'm going
[1:42:31] to say, I'm going to say these words.
[1:42:34] Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy
[1:42:37] Ghost. Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive
[1:42:40] the Holy Ghost. Receive the fire.
[1:42:43] Hallelujah. Receive the Holy Ghost. Open
[1:42:46] your heart, my brother. Open your heart,
[1:42:48] my sister. The Holy Ghost is falling.
[1:42:52] You can see. You can see. The Holy Ghost
[1:42:55] is falling this day. This scripture is
[1:43:00] fulfilled this day. The scripture is
[1:43:04] fulfilled. Receive the fire. Receive the
[1:43:08] fire. Yes.
[1:43:10] Receive it. Receive it. Receive it. Woo!
[1:43:14] Hallelujah. Fire, fire, fire. Receive
[1:43:18] the fire. Receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:20] Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy
[1:43:23] Ghost. Can I have the musicians? You can
[1:43:26] receive the Holy Ghost. The Lord is
[1:43:28] here, my brother. The Lord is here, my
[1:43:30] sister. He's moving. He's moving. I can
[1:43:34] safely tell you, he's moving right now.
[1:43:37] Receive your blessing. Receive it.
[1:43:39] Receive it. Receive it. Fire. Fire.
[1:43:42] Fire. Hallelujah. He's passing by. Oh,
[1:43:48] your sickness has insulted you long
[1:43:50] enough. There was a time Goliath was
[1:43:54] insulting the armies of God. But one day
[1:43:56] he insulted at the wrong time. Your
[1:44:00] sickness has insulted at the wrong time.
[1:44:03] Today, whether it wants it or not, it's
[1:44:06] going. It's going. Receive your healing.
[1:44:10] It's falling right now. Receive your
[1:44:12] healing. Receive your healing. Receive
[1:44:15] the fire. Receive the power. Receive the
[1:44:19] power. God is here, my brother. You can
[1:44:22] be saved. You can be changed.
[1:44:26] Hallelujah.
[1:44:27] Oh, hallelujah. Things are changing
[1:44:30] right now. Wars are breaking right now.
[1:44:33] The walls of Jericho are breaking right
[1:44:36] now. You are being set free. You are
[1:44:38] being set free. Come on, praise the
[1:44:40] Lord. You are being set free. Receive
[1:44:43] your freedom. Receive your healing.
[1:44:46] Receive the fire. Hallelujah. Receive
[1:44:49] the fire. Receive the fire. Receive the
[1:44:52] power. Hallelujah. Receive it. Receive
[1:44:56] it. Receive it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:00] He's here. Come on. He's here, my
[1:45:04] sister. He's passing by. Touch him. You
[1:45:08] can touch him. You can touch him. You
[1:45:12] can touch him. Say like a woman. Oh, if
[1:45:15] only if only I can touch the
[1:45:21] shall be healed. You are going to be
[1:45:24] healed. Touch him with your prayer.
[1:45:26] Touch him with your faith. He is passing
[1:45:29] by. Touch him my brother. Touch him my
[1:45:32] sister. He is passing by. Oh, if only if
[1:45:37] only I can touch I can touch the hand of
[1:45:40] your God and Lord, I shall be healed.
[1:45:44] Jesus,
[1:45:45] they are waiting on you. Jesus,
[1:45:50] we are waiting on you. Touch your
[1:45:52] people. Change their situation. Touch
[1:45:55] everyone.
[1:45:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, come on.
[1:46:01] Come on. Come on. He's here. Oh, praise
