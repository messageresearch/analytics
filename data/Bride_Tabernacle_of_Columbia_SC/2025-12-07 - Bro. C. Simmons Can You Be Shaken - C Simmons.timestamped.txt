[36:49] your anointing and your presence being
[36:51] in here cuz Lord, you said when two or
[36:53] three are gathered in my name, there you

[36:57] you and we ask that you just help us
[36:58] today [music] and Lord move us out of
[37:00] the way that you may get all the glory,

[37:04] we pray. Amen.
[37:07] [music]
[37:09] Amen. How many happy to be in the house
[37:10] of the Lord this morning? Amen.
[37:13] This morning we'll turn to the book of
[37:15] Exodus. A very familiar scripture.
[37:18] [music] Amen.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 14.
[37:45] And we're going to start at verse
[37:48] five. I believe
[37:53] was very familiar scripture. But it and
[37:55] it reads when you got it, say amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it was told the king of
[38:01] Egypt that the people fled in the heart
[38:03] of Pharaoh and his servants were turned
[38:06] against the people. And they said, "Why
[38:08] have we done this
[38:11] that we have let Israel go from serving
[38:13] us?" And he made ready his chariot and
[38:16] took his people with him. And he took
[38:19] 600 chosen chariots and all the chariots
[38:21] of Egypt and captains over every one of
[38:24] them. And the Lord hardened the heart of
[38:27] Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued
[38:29] after the children of Israel.
[38:33] And the children of Israel went out with
[38:34] a high hand. But the Egyptians pursued
[38:37] after them all the horses and the
[38:39] chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and
[38:42] his army
[38:45] and overtook them in camping by the sea
[38:47] besides
[38:48] Pahhiro.
[38:51] Amen. before Baal Zephon.
[38:54] And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children
[38:57] of Israel lifted up their eyes, and
[38:58] behold, the Egyptians marched after
[39:00] them, and they were sore afraid. And the
[39:03] children of Israel cried unto the Lord,
[39:06] and they said unto Moses, "Because there
[39:08] were were no graves in Egypt, hast thou
[39:11] taken us away to die in the wilderness?
[39:14] Wherefore hast thou dealt with us to
[39:17] carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this
[39:21] the word that we did tell thee in Egypt,
[39:24] saying, Let us alone, that we may serve
[39:26] the Egyptians, for it had been better
[39:29] for us to serve the Egyptians, than that
[39:32] we should die in the wilderness. And
[39:34] Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye
[39:36] not, stand still, and see the salvation
[39:39] of the Lord, which ye will show to you
[39:42] today. For the Egyptians whom ye have
[39:44] seen today, ye sh ye shall see them
[39:47] again no more forever. The Lord shall
[39:50] fight for you, and ye shall hold your
[39:52] peace. Amen. God bless the reading of
[39:54] this word. You may be seated.
[39:59] This morning, I'd like to speak on a
[40:01] little topic that I entitled,
[40:04] can you be shaken?
[40:06] Can you be shaken? Uh pastor said when
[40:09] in talking about faith and I thought
[40:11] about it and I said you know the
[40:12] children of Israel they got to the Red
[40:14] Sea and many of them start to question
[40:17] their faith. Many of them they they
[40:19] started to do the do the opposite of the
[40:22] psalm that we just s sung that they
[40:25] could they were wondering whether they
[40:26] could trust in God or not. Now they had
[40:29] just seen him deliver them from the
[40:30] Egyptians but they decided you know what
[40:33] this this Red Sea might be too big. They
[40:36] decided when they got there, this Red
[40:38] Sea might be insurmountable. I don't
[40:41] know if we can get out of this
[40:42] situation.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; But I wonder this morning, can your
[40:46] faith be shaken?
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Can you be shaken? Because when you have
[40:51] such a faith in God, nothing can shake
[40:54] you from your faith in God. That's why
[40:56] when someone comes to you and tell you
[40:58] something contrary to the word of God,
[41:00] you're not shaken. You're not stirred.
[41:02] It doesn't bother you because you have
[41:04] something that you can hold on to. You
[41:07] have something that you have your trust
[41:08] in that doesn't matter which way the
[41:10] wind bloweth or the wave listeth, you
[41:13] know that there's something that I'm
[41:14] standing on. And said, when your faith
[41:17] is so solid, it can't be shaken. It's
[41:20] like the story said, it's on a rock that
[41:22] I that I might have spoke on at another
[41:25] time. It's on a rock and it's something
[41:26] that can't be moved. Doesn't matter who
[41:29] comes and try to talk you out of your
[41:31] faith. You can't be talked out of it.
[41:33] You can't be persuaded to believe
[41:35] something other than that because you
[41:37] believe that God is real. And it may not
[41:40] it may not be their experience, but
[41:41] that's your experience. And you might
[41:43] not can tell everyone or know how to
[41:45] describe it, but you know inside of you
[41:47] that what I'm standing on is the truth.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; What I'm standing on, I have faith in it
[41:52] and I shall not be moved.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; See, Moses told him, he said, "Fear
[41:56] not." Amen.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Because he knew that the God that was in
[42:00] the cloud was the same God that was with
[42:02] him. He knew that the God that that when
[42:05] when you read down further, he said that
[42:08] and I wanted to read it because it it
[42:10] stood out to me, but but when you read
[42:13] down, it it said that um
[42:19] Lord have mercy.
[42:28] said verse 22, that's what I want to get
[42:30] to. He said, "And the children of
[42:32] Israel," if you don't know the story,
[42:34] God, he opened the Red Sea and allowed
[42:36] them to part straight through on dry
[42:38] ground. And verse 22, and he said, "And
[42:40] the children of Israel went into the
[42:42] midst of the sea upon the dry ground,
[42:44] and the waters were a wall unto unto
[42:47] them on their right hand and on their
[42:49] left. And the Egyptians pursued and went
[42:52] in after them in the midst of the sea,
[42:54] even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots,
[42:58] and his horsemen. And it came to pass
[43:00] that in the morning watch the Lord
[43:03] looked unto the host of the Egyptian
[43:07] through the pillar of fire of the cloud.
[43:09] I thought it was striking that it said
[43:11] that the Lord looked down cuz you know I
[43:14] read this many many times and told the
[43:16] story but to realize that the Lord was
[43:18] right there with him that he he saw the
[43:21] Egyptians and he looked through the
[43:23] pillar of fire right at those Egyptians.
[43:25] Then he said that enemy right there is
[43:28] destroyed today. And it was striking to
[43:30] me. It said the Lord. So anytimes he
[43:33] said when I am afraid I will trust in
[43:35] thee. See, when you got a faith that
[43:37] that you realize that God is right here
[43:39] with me, God is standing right here with
[43:42] me. No matter how bad the situation
[43:44] looks, no matter how insurmountable it
[43:47] looks, God is right here watching
[43:49] directly over me. And that's why I
[43:51] wanted to read it so that you can see it
[43:53] that God, he was right there. He wasn't
[43:56] far off. He wasn't here or there. He
[43:58] wasn't all the way. He was right there.
[44:00] And not only that, he was watching. He
[44:02] was looking down on them. He saw the
[44:05] enemy and said this day this enemy is
[44:07] here no more. See that faith that was
[44:10] that now they had something. If you
[44:12] realize that you got something to
[44:14] believe in that when your trial and your
[44:16] test come will God be right there
[44:19] looking down. He said I'm the same
[44:21] yesterday, today and forever. So if he
[44:24] was there with the children of Israel
[44:26] and you are the children of God,
[44:28] therefore he's not he's here right with
[44:30] you.
[44:31] And matter of fact, he's closer with you
[44:34] now than he was with them.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; See, with them, he was in the pillar of
[44:39] cloud. He was in the fire. But but when
[44:41] he got down and he got further in the
[44:43] scripture and he died for you and he
[44:46] saved you and he he allowed you to come
[44:48] and get baptized, then he said, "I shall
[44:50] fill you with the Holy Ghost." See, that
[44:52] was a promise he would give to you. All
[44:54] you had to do is believe that God would
[44:56] do it for you. See, it all has to do
[44:58] what you having faith that God can do
[45:00] it. It all has to do is deep down the
[45:03] faith. And if you can believe that all
[45:05] things are possible, then you can
[45:07] believe that God can fill me with the
[45:09] Holy Ghost. God can change my nature,
[45:12] God can give me a new body, he can do
[45:14] these things. He can heal my body. And
[45:17] see, once you realize that it's all
[45:18] based upon your faith, the pro the angel
[45:22] told the prophet of God, if you can get
[45:23] them to believe, then all things will be
[45:26] possible.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; No matter how impossible it might have
[45:29] seemed, no matter how distant it might
[45:31] have seemed, all things would be
[45:32] possible.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; It's all about us elevating our faith to
[45:36] believe that these things can be
[45:37] possible.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; We don't even have to see it to believe
[45:40] it. See that's God Jesus said he said
[45:44] blessed is the man that believeth
[45:46] without sin.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's what faith is and and
[45:50] the prophet God talked about it.
[45:53] He said that
[45:57] he said
[45:59] now you see what faith is. It's
[46:01] something. Now look friends I know that
[46:04] all of you are at least know this. The
[46:05] body is controlled by five senses. Is
[46:09] that right? He said all right it's got
[46:11] five senses is everywhere that
[46:13] everything that controls this human
[46:15] body. He said the senses are the five
[46:18] senses is see is taste is feel is smell
[46:22] and hear is that right? Them five senses
[46:25] control the entire human body. He said
[46:29] now there is none of them that declare
[46:31] faith. He said faith is the six sense.
[46:35] He said, he said, "Faith is the only
[46:38] direct and positive sense. It's the
[46:41] sixth sense. Faith is more than sight.
[46:44] Faith is more than feeling. You don't
[46:47] have to feel faith. You don't taste
[46:49] faith. You don't smell faith. You don't
[46:51] see faith. Faith is the substance of
[46:53] things hoped for and the evidence of
[46:55] things not seen." And I thought about
[46:58] it. I said, "You know, each one of us
[46:59] have to have faith every single day."
[47:01] Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Because if if we got in our car and we
[47:04] turned our wheel to the right and it
[47:06] went left
[47:08] and then we turned it to the left and it
[47:10] went right, we the first thing we do is
[47:13] say something is wrong with this car
[47:15] because somebody told me that when it
[47:17] goes right, I'm supposed to go right.
[47:20] And when I turn it left, I'm supposed to
[47:22] go left. And I'm and and I and I was
[47:25] thinking about it. I was like, you know,
[47:27] we're believing in what somebody told
[47:28] us.
[47:30] It's that simple. Somebody told us that
[47:32] right was right and left. Who who's
[47:34] saying that that was the right way? But
[47:36] hey,
[47:38] all that I got to say is that sometimes
[47:40] we have faith in these things because
[47:42] there's something that's deeper that we
[47:43] believe is true.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; I always think of it as as someone that
[47:48] studied mathematics. I said, you know,
[47:51] who decided that one was one and two was
[47:54] two?
[47:56] Only God could do that. Because if you
[47:58] look back through the time and look back
[48:00] through history, if we didn't have
[48:02] something to count, none of mathematics
[48:04] would work. Money wouldn't work. None of
[48:08] that would work. But it has to you have
[48:10] to every day that you get up, you have
[48:13] to have some type of faith.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; You have to believe that you know when I
[48:17] take this step, I can step. But you
[48:20] don't think about it because it's an
[48:21] inherent faith. It's something that it's
[48:24] been drilled in time over time that when
[48:26] I open my mouth, I can speak
[48:28] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to be able to create
[48:30] words and and and it's not until you
[48:33] less able to do it that you have to
[48:35] believe in something else.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; It's not until your leg hurts that you
[48:38] say, you know, that it was a blessing to
[48:41] be able to walk.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; It was a blessing to be able to lift my
[48:44] hands. It was a blessing to be able to
[48:46] do these things. And when the when it's
[48:48] been restored to you, then you realize,
[48:50] you know what, there there's a faith
[48:52] that I'm believing in that God does
[48:54] these things each and every day that the
[48:56] if the sun wasn't to rise one morning,
[48:59] the whole world would be in chaos.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; If if the if the moon wasn't to come up
[49:04] and do the tides every night, the world
[49:07] would be in chaos. For some reason, we
[49:10] believe that the sun's going to rise the
[49:11] next morning and we believe that the
[49:13] moon is going to come up because that's
[49:15] the way God created it.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And when you realize how powerful the
[49:19] thing is that you have faith in of the
[49:22] things that you don't even think about,
[49:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:26] &gt;&gt; It's so it's so I wonder how easy it is
[49:29] to believe in God.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; If you can believe in all these things
[49:33] that your car going to run, your house
[49:34] still going to be there when you get
[49:36] back home, all these things. how simple
[49:39] it is to believe in the one that created
[49:41] you.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Can your faith be shaken?
[49:45] Can you be shaken?" Because when you
[49:48] have faith in God, the devil is going to
[49:50] come and test your faith.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; The devil is going to try to get you to
[49:54] not believe in what you can believe.
[49:56] That's why he sent the Egyptians.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he sent them there because he
[50:01] wanted them to forget the God that had
[50:03] just delivered them. He wanted them to
[50:06] forget the God that had just rocked them
[50:08] out of 400 years of slavery,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; had just delivered them and go to Mo
[50:14] Moses. And he wanted to cause contention
[50:16] in the camp.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; He wanted to cause a fight that they
[50:20] would go against the leader that was
[50:22] leading them, telling them to have faith
[50:24] in God, keep believing. He brought us
[50:26] out of Egypt. They got sick of that
[50:27] testimony.
[50:30] They had lost faith in the one that was
[50:32] leading them. God had put in position to
[50:34] lead them.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; They had gone on to now they said you
[50:38] could have left us back in sin.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; You could have left us back in there. We
[50:43] could have just lived our lives and died
[50:45] a slave when there was something that
[50:47] was promised that was greater to come to
[50:49] them.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; There was something that God had for
[50:52] them that was greater than where they
[50:54] were. And God was God had to deliver
[50:56] them from the Egyp Egyptians to take
[50:58] them to the promised land. They couldn't
[51:00] be in the promised land in Egypt. They
[51:03] couldn't They had to go through the
[51:04] wilderness. They had to cross the Red
[51:06] Sea. They had to go in the in the desert
[51:08] before they crossed to over there into
[51:11] into the promised land. But they had to
[51:13] one day believe that there was a
[51:15] promised land for me.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And said, "Sometimes you got to believe
[51:18] that there's a heaven and there's a
[51:20] place that's set aside for me.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And I can't tell you whether you believe
[51:24] it or not, but I believe there's a house
[51:26] that God has prepared for me." cuz he
[51:28] said in his word that he promised that
[51:31] there were mansions that was there that
[51:33] you know that's untold or unseen things
[51:36] that we've never seen before that's over
[51:38] there that's waiting and prepared for
[51:40] those that believe in him. But if you
[51:42] don't believe that he's the one true God
[51:44] and he can save you from your sins. How
[51:46] are you ever going to get there?
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; See, it all comes back to whether you
[51:52] can believe or not. And when you when
[51:54] you do believe, can you be shaken?
[51:58] when you do believe, can you be shaken?
[52:01] And and I thought of some some people in
[52:03] the Bible when I was reading here and I
[52:07] thought of and I was like, you know,
[52:09] Lazarus and his sisters, his sisters,
[52:11] they believed in God, but they was a
[52:13] little iffy.
[52:15] You know, somebody you talk to them and
[52:17] you know, they be iffy. What I mean is
[52:19] they they'll say something and then two
[52:21] seconds later they'll change their mind
[52:23] and two more seconds later they'll
[52:24] change their mind again. You be like, "I
[52:29] wonder. I can't really trust what you
[52:31] what you standing on."
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Because whatever you standing on, you're
[52:34] not sure what you're standing on.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; And if you're not sure, then and then I
[52:39] don't want to be confused because you're
[52:41] not sure. And so, son, they was a little
[52:43] iffy. They said, "Lord, we know that you
[52:46] can raise him up again in the
[52:47] resurrection. We know we know certain
[52:49] things are true. We have faith that
[52:50] you're the one true God and all these
[52:52] things, but you'll raise them up in the
[52:53] resurrection." But God was trying to
[52:56] show them. Jesus was trying to show them
[52:58] that I want you to elevate your faith
[53:00] higher. You don't have to wait till the
[53:02] resurrection to see your brother. You
[53:04] don't have to wait till the resurrection
[53:06] even though he might have been in the
[53:07] grave for 4 days. This is the God that
[53:10] does the impossible.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; So if he wants to, he can go to the
[53:15] gravestone just like he did and say,
[53:17] "Lazarus, come forth."
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; That took faith. That took believing.
[53:21] But he knew that the word that was
[53:23] spoken, something had to happen because
[53:26] when he spoke a word, when God speaks a
[53:28] word, which he put in his in his Bible,
[53:31] when God speaks a word, it can't return
[53:33] unto him void. So when he speaks it, all
[53:35] you have to do is believe it.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; There was faith behind the words that
[53:39] was spoken.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Now, they said that if he wouldn't have
[53:43] called Lazarus, everybody in the grave
[53:44] would have woke up. Why? Cuz that was
[53:47] the faith that was behind that word.
[53:49] That's why he had to call him by name.
[53:51] He had to say, "Lazarus, come forth."
[53:54] And see, when God calls you, he calls
[53:56] you by your name. He doesn't go to this
[53:58] one or that one or this one and that. He
[54:00] said, "You come forth." He calls you by
[54:02] name. He said, "You come unto me."
[54:05] &gt;&gt; All ye that heavily laid and heavy
[54:06] burden and I'll give you rest. He calls
[54:09] you.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Because he knows specifically who he's
[54:13] calling.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; He's not going to sister and brother
[54:16] them. He said it's you. And when he
[54:18] calls you, he wants you to have faith
[54:20] and believe that I'm calling you. Come
[54:22] unto me.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; See, that's why, but the sisters, she,
[54:27] you know, they might have had faith
[54:28] until they actually seen Lazarus
[54:30] walking. And then some of them was like,
[54:33] is that true? And then Jesus had to tell
[54:36] them, "Go loose some. Let him go.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; He's free. He's He's here now. He's
[54:41] back. I brought him here." So So because
[54:44] I wanted you to see that all things are
[54:46] possible. Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to see before I die that
[54:50] someone can be dead and be re and God
[54:52] can call them back. Before I go in this
[54:54] grave and get crucified, I want you to
[54:56] see that it's real. He's the same God.
[54:59] He He let him show. He showed it to him
[55:01] before. I don't know why they had a
[55:03] problem believing that he was going to
[55:04] come back
[55:06] cuz he showed them Lazarus.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; If he showed it, he he said, "I'm the
[55:11] same yesterday, today, and forever." So
[55:13] he showed him Lazarus. He said, "This
[55:15] man could be stinking in the grave 4
[55:17] days and speaking the word of faith that
[55:19] he can come back."
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Now, if he can do that, when I get
[55:22] crucified, what do you think's going to
[55:24] happen when I said, "I'm coming back in
[55:26] 3 days."
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And see, they started, they might have
[55:29] questioned it, but it took them a lot
[55:31] of, you know, some of them had a had
[55:33] some experiences before they actually
[55:35] truly believed. Like the two men that
[55:37] was on the road to Emmas, they had to
[55:40] have a whole conversation. Now imagine
[55:42] you walking for hours and Jesus right
[55:45] there with you. He done told you I was I
[55:48] done died. I'm coming back. And it was a
[55:51] testimony that morning that the women
[55:53] they went to the tomb and they said
[55:55] nobody is here.
[55:57] So I can imagine them on the road and
[55:59] they getting dejected.
[56:02] You know he done died.
[56:05] We don't know what happened to his body
[56:07] and they getting dejected on this road.
[56:10] But and then but when they get on the
[56:12] road, they start talking to this
[56:13] stranger. These two men start talking to
[56:16] this stranger and you know they having a
[56:18] conversation but the conversation get
[56:20] real interesting because you ever had a
[56:23] conversation with someone and and the
[56:24] whole conversation you sitting there
[56:26] learning
[56:27] &gt;&gt; you sitting there learning and it become
[56:30] a good conversation. It's like wow I
[56:32] ain't never see it like that. And he
[56:34] going through from Genesis all the way
[56:36] up into time showing where Jesus was
[56:39] said he would be in the Bible and what
[56:41] was going to happen to him when he come
[56:43] and talking about David and talking
[56:44] about Elijah when he prophesied of these
[56:47] things and going through all the
[56:48] scriptures. See they was educated and
[56:50] learned. They knew what he was talking
[56:52] about and they knew what he was saying
[56:53] was the truth. And when they got down to
[56:55] it, they realized, you know what? We we
[56:59] want to continue on cuz Jesus, he fained
[57:02] like he was going to go on down the
[57:03] road. And they said, "No, no, no. You
[57:05] got to stop here." Sometimes you got to
[57:07] stop Jesus when he on his way.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus was on his way. And they had to
[57:11] stop him. They said, "No, no, no. Uh-uh.
[57:13] Whatever you giving us, Lord, I want
[57:16] more of it." And sometimes you got to
[57:18] have faith and you be like, "You know
[57:19] what? I may not understand it, but Lord,
[57:21] I want more of it. Lord, I may not
[57:24] understand what's going on, but Lord, I
[57:25] want more of it. Lord, while you're
[57:27] filling with your anointing, I may not
[57:29] understand all that comes with it, but I
[57:31] want more of it. See, when you filling
[57:33] my cup, I want it to overflow. I don't
[57:35] just want to be filled.
[57:38] Said when when they kept when they
[57:40] entreated him to come, it was something
[57:42] about they said, you know, we've been
[57:43] traveling all day. Let's let's get some
[57:45] food. And they went to he and when he
[57:48] went and he broke the bread, their eyes
[57:49] were open. They understood right then
[57:52] that this was Jesus, the one that said
[57:54] that that told us that what was going to
[57:56] happen and now he's here with us. Now
[57:59] their faith had exploded. They they ran
[58:01] all the way back to those that were
[58:03] gathered and said, "We saw him. We saw
[58:06] the man that told us that he was going
[58:07] to die and raise again. We saw Jesus
[58:11] &gt;&gt; now. It wasn't just something that was
[58:13] told to him.
[58:15] It wasn't something that, you know, they
[58:17] thought of, they envisioned. It was an
[58:19] experience. It was something that they
[58:21] know they could tell it with great
[58:23] faith, with great enthusiasm. You know
[58:25] what? We're no longer shaken. We're no
[58:28] longer worried about whether he's here
[58:30] or whether he's not. We know he's here.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; We saw him with our own eyes. We know
[58:34] he's with us. We know that he he came
[58:37] back. We know that he died and he rose
[58:39] again. We're not worried about what you
[58:41] told him. We know it from ourselves. Now
[58:44] &gt;&gt; see see they they had gotten up to the
[58:46] level and they were speaking with the
[58:48] impassion that they knew. And then Jesus
[58:50] he eventually he showed up in the room
[58:52] with them.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; For all those that didn't believe
[58:57] including doubting Thomas
[58:59] &gt;&gt; he showed up. He some people you can't
[59:01] just tell them a thing. You got to show
[59:03] them.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; And some people you can't even show
[59:05] them. They got to see it for themselves.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; And some people you can't even show them
[59:09] or let them see it for the do action.
[59:13] that actually believe, you know, it's
[59:14] possible.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; You know, if you told someone, "I can
[59:17] hammer a nail through this wood." Some
[59:19] people be like, "No, you can't."
[59:22] Some people got to put the hammer in
[59:23] their hand and do it like that. And some
[59:26] people they got to do it for themselves
[59:27] to you know what the hammer the nail
[59:29] does go through the wood. But it it's
[59:32] all in different levels of faith though.
[59:35] It's whether you believe when somebody
[59:37] tell you or whether you have to do the
[59:38] action. And sometime God has to allow
[59:40] your faith to grow. That's right.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; God has to allow your faith to grow and
[59:44] he has to allow you to come up. He said
[59:47] he said some have faith that can heal.
[59:49] He said some people they have great big
[59:51] faith. He said they can be healed in a
[59:54] moment.
[59:56] Some have faith that much that that they
[59:58] can be healed in a week. Some has muster
[1:00:01] seed faith. He said it takes them a long
[1:00:04] time. But just follow it. It's genuine.
[1:00:07] It'll bring you to the light. Just hold
[1:00:09] on to it and keep moving. and it'll
[1:00:11] bring you out. You just keep holding on
[1:00:14] to that faith, it'll bring you through.
[1:00:15] It's real mustard seed. You know,
[1:00:18] mustard don't mix with nothing. It's
[1:00:20] genuine. You can't mix kale and spinach
[1:00:22] and so forth. You can't mix mustard with
[1:00:25] nothing. And when they mustard stays
[1:00:27] mustard
[1:00:29] and when real faith takes a hold in the
[1:00:32] heart, it's not intellectual. It's it's
[1:00:35] not reason no more. It's real. It's the
[1:00:37] spirit of God witnessing through you.
[1:00:40] God's word is true. I stay right with
[1:00:42] it. Yes, sir. And that brings the
[1:00:44] results. See, when you have real faith
[1:00:47] in God, nothing can move you from your
[1:00:49] faith.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Nothing can persuade you, dissuade you
[1:00:53] that your faith is real.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; And what God has spoken to you, whether
[1:00:57] he whether you understand it or not, you
[1:00:59] say, "I'm standing on it. See, I believe
[1:01:01] it. God spoke it. God said it. And
[1:01:03] that's it for me. That's all that
[1:01:05] matters to me. I can stand right here on
[1:01:07] this faith and believe that God is going
[1:01:09] to do what he said he's going to do. I
[1:01:11] can believe that God is going to heal my
[1:01:13] body because he says by his stripes I am
[1:01:15] healed. I don't have to move. I don't
[1:01:17] have to be persuaded. No matter what the
[1:01:19] doctor says, nobody says or even how I
[1:01:22] feel.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; See, the devil deals a lot with your
[1:01:25] feelings, but faith supersedes your
[1:01:27] feelings. You got to get past how you
[1:01:29] feel. You got to get past how you're
[1:01:31] thinking. You got to change your mindset
[1:01:33] and said, "Lord, what you said, I
[1:01:35] believe it. That settles it.
[1:01:38] And I got to keep going on it. I might
[1:01:41] not see it today. I might not see it
[1:01:42] tomorrow. I might not see it next week.
[1:01:44] But I know that eventually something is
[1:01:46] going to take place because I believe in
[1:01:49] what you said. I believe that you're
[1:01:51] going to do it. And I'm going to stand
[1:01:53] on it. I'm going to keep confessing it
[1:01:55] until like like the the the man in the
[1:01:58] story, his eyes popped open. He kept
[1:02:00] telling everyone, "I can see. I can see.
[1:02:03] I can see. I can see." And one day he
[1:02:06] was sitting in that barber chair and his
[1:02:07] eyes popped open. He said, "I can see."
[1:02:11] It was a reality. His testimony became
[1:02:14] his reality. And whatever you say is
[1:02:16] power in what you speak. THERE'S POWER
[1:02:19] IN what you speak. And when you elevate
[1:02:21] your faith to believe in what you're
[1:02:23] saying, something got to take place.
[1:02:25] Something has to move in your life.
[1:02:27] Something has to go on because you
[1:02:29] believe in what you say and you're not
[1:02:31] wavering on it. You're not moving ON IT.
[1:02:33] YOU'RE NOT GOING ON. You said, "Lord,
[1:02:35] I'm standing right here just like Jacob.
[1:02:38] I'm wrestling this angel. I'm going to
[1:02:40] continue to wrestle this angel till God
[1:02:42] does something for me."
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; See, I'm going to believe that God got a
[1:02:47] blessing for me. And I'm not letting
[1:02:49] this angel go until he blessed me. I'm
[1:02:52] He came for a reason. and I'm going to
[1:02:54] get what God has for me right now today
[1:02:57] cuz I believe that God can do it for me.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Says some people it'll take a week,
[1:03:03] it'll take a month, it might take a
[1:03:05] year. But if you stand on it and you
[1:03:07] believe and you keep having faith and
[1:03:09] you don't doubt every time the devil
[1:03:11] brings that down into your mind, you you
[1:03:13] send it away and say, "Get behind me,
[1:03:15] Satan. No, get behind me, Satan. No,
[1:03:18] that ain't what the Lord told me. Uh-uh.
[1:03:20] I'm going to let it go. I'm going to let
[1:03:22] it go." Uh-uh. MOVE ON. I'm standing
[1:03:24] right here because God told me if I
[1:03:27] trust in him and never doubt, he would
[1:03:29] surely bring me out. See, that's what
[1:03:31] I'm believing in. That's what I'm
[1:03:32] trusting in. That's what I'm standing
[1:03:34] on. Lord, elevate my faith. Lord, move
[1:03:37] me higher. Lord, [screaming] take me
[1:03:39] higher. Lord, elevate my faith, Jesus.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; You have to pray those prayers cuz
[1:03:45] sometimes you're not where God wants you
[1:03:47] to be. You can't until you get there.
[1:03:50] You said, "Lord, elevate me. Lord, move
[1:03:52] me higher. Lord, take me deeper. Lord,
[1:03:54] give me a deeper walk. Lord, give me a
[1:03:56] closer walk, Lord. Lord, elevate my
[1:03:58] faith. I want to see you more, Lord. I
[1:04:00] want to see you every day, Lord. I don't
[1:04:02] want to be on Sundays only, but Lord,
[1:04:04] move in my life.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; See, Lord, I believe. I trust you. Lord,
[1:04:11] I trust you and I won't doubt you.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; See, when you get there, you'll realize
[1:04:15] what Abraham was talking about when it
[1:04:17] said he staggered not at the promises of
[1:04:19] God. See, see when you get that type of
[1:04:22] faith, you realize he can get up and he
[1:04:24] can move without his family. He can get
[1:04:26] up and leave there. He can believe in a
[1:04:28] promise for 25 years.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; It didn't take Abraham a week a month.
[1:04:32] It took him 25 years to get what God
[1:04:35] promised him. But it said he staggered
[1:04:37] not at the promises of God. He staggered
[1:04:40] not when God told him, "You going to
[1:04:42] have a son." Not only that, you going to
[1:04:44] have a son with your wife. the one
[1:04:46] that's right here with you, that's just
[1:04:48] that's getting up in age just with you.
[1:04:50] Y'all both are going to have a son. See,
[1:04:53] it took him 25 years to realize it. But
[1:04:56] when the realization came, it was just
[1:04:58] like God said it would be. It God didn't
[1:05:01] need no help in it. God didn't need no
[1:05:03] nothing of anything they could do. It
[1:05:05] was just what God wanted to do in
[1:05:07] Abraham's life. It was just what God
[1:05:10] promised unto him. But you had Abraham
[1:05:12] had to have faith to believe that this
[1:05:14] was possible. Yes.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham didn't understand it. He might
[1:05:19] not have understand it. And many of
[1:05:20] times, guess what? When you on your
[1:05:22] journey, some people are not going to
[1:05:24] understand what God told you.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; When you tell them, sometimes you got to
[1:05:29] keep your mouth closed cuz other people
[1:05:30] ain't going to understand what God told
[1:05:32] you.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Those might be close to you. They they
[1:05:35] might not understand. And they might do
[1:05:37] like Joel friends and try to convince
[1:05:39] you. Why do you serve the God that you
[1:05:41] serve? Mhm.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I see the God that you serve just take
[1:05:45] you through trials and tribulation.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I see the God that you serve take your
[1:05:50] whole family from you.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; I see the God that you serve take all
[1:05:53] your money and all your riches. I see
[1:05:55] the God that you serve give you a
[1:05:57] sickness that you right here on the side
[1:06:00] of the road with boils on your skin and
[1:06:02] no one wants to be around you. That's
[1:06:04] that's the God that you serve. Yes.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And to have such faith in God
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; that said, "Naked I came into this world
[1:06:13] and naked I shall return."
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; See, when Job had such faith in God,
[1:06:18] see, that's why God allowed the devil to
[1:06:20] attack him.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; He allowed him cuz he knew his faith in
[1:06:23] God was going to supersede all of that.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; His faith in God and trust in God was
[1:06:28] going to move past all of that. It was
[1:06:31] going to allow him to look past all of
[1:06:33] that and said, and allow him to believe
[1:06:36] that, you know what, the same God that
[1:06:38] gave it to me, it's okay if he take it
[1:06:40] away.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; It's okay if he take it away. And if
[1:06:43] that's the end of my story, then that's
[1:06:45] okay, too.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Because when I go, I'm going to see him.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see him in my flesh. And
[1:06:51] that and see, he had that understanding
[1:06:53] that it was something that I can't be
[1:06:54] shaken in what I believe in. Well, I
[1:06:57] believe in a God that supersedes all the
[1:06:59] ones that y'all talking about. All the
[1:07:01] ones that have y'all swaying back and
[1:07:03] forth. No, no, no. This God that I I can
[1:07:05] keep him believing on them cuz the Lord
[1:07:07] gave me all these things. But you see,
[1:07:08] that wasn't the end of Job's story. That
[1:07:11] wasn't the end of Job's story. One day,
[1:07:13] he got to the other side of the test and
[1:07:15] the trial. After God rewarded him for
[1:07:18] his faith, God rewarded him for
[1:07:21] believing and trusting him and staying
[1:07:23] true to what he believed in. God allowed
[1:07:25] him to gain doublefold what he lost.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; God allowed him to get double what he
[1:07:31] lost. And it was something that they say
[1:07:33] Job was the first first book that was
[1:07:35] written in the Bible way way before many
[1:07:39] of the other ones. And the first story
[1:07:40] is a faith, the trials and tribulation
[1:07:42] of faith in God. It shows you how
[1:07:45] important it is when you have faith that
[1:07:48] all things are possible. Now, now he God
[1:07:51] could have ended the story with Job just
[1:07:54] holding on to the word and still in it.
[1:07:55] But God allowed you to see that there's
[1:07:58] something that's greater than where you
[1:07:59] are in your current situation. That
[1:08:02] could have been the end of the story,
[1:08:03] but God allowed it to come on through.
[1:08:05] Come on through. No, no, no. I want to
[1:08:06] show you that there's a blessing on the
[1:08:08] other side of the test. There was
[1:08:10] something on the other side of the test.
[1:08:12] If you keep on believing, if you keep on
[1:08:14] trusting, if you keep on believing, God
[1:08:17] will do the impossible. Now, Job might
[1:08:19] have been okay if he did a third of what
[1:08:21] he had before, but God blessed him with
[1:08:23] double what he had before. See, there's
[1:08:26] nothing that God can't do. All you got
[1:08:29] to do is sit down and say, "Lord, I
[1:08:30] believe." Lord, I believe. That's it.
[1:08:33] Lord, I believe. And I'm not going to
[1:08:35] move on it. Lord, I believe.
[1:08:38] And when the doubt comes, I push it
[1:08:40] aside and say, "Lord, I believe." And
[1:08:42] when the devil comes, I push him aside
[1:08:44] and say, "Lord, I believe."
[1:08:45] And when when this one comes, I'll push
[1:08:47] them aside and say, "Lord, I believe."
[1:08:50] And when that one comes and mother and
[1:08:51] father, they don't understand. But Lord,
[1:08:53] I believe that Lord, I I don't
[1:08:55] understand how, but I know if you sent
[1:08:57] me this way, you got a way to bring me
[1:08:59] through this way. Lord, if you to order
[1:09:02] my step this way, then you're going to
[1:09:03] continue to take my steps on. I don't
[1:09:06] understand it. I don't know why. I don't
[1:09:08] know why. I don't understand. But I
[1:09:10] don't need to understand. All I got to
[1:09:11] do is trust you, Lord. All I got to do
[1:09:14] is believe that you're ordering my
[1:09:15] steps. All I got to do is understand
[1:09:17] that you're leading me, you're guiding
[1:09:19] me, you're taking me along this way. And
[1:09:21] Lord, if I'm put my trust in you, and I
[1:09:24] don't doubt you, I know that you're
[1:09:25] going to lead me out of it. I know that
[1:09:27] you're going to bring me over it because
[1:09:29] that's what you said you would do.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Said,
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; and and and I started to see it. I said
[1:09:40] Abraham, his faith never wavered through
[1:09:42] all the test and trials of life that he
[1:09:45] went through.
[1:09:49] And I wanted to
[1:09:51] I wanted to turn to the scripture
[1:09:54] because there was something
[1:09:57] in Romans chapter 4
[1:10:00] verse 20.
[1:10:07] When you got to say amen. Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; And the reason he staggered not at the
[1:10:12] promise of God through unbelief, but was
[1:10:15] strong in faith, giving glory to God,
[1:10:18] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:10:21] had promised, he was also to perform. He
[1:10:25] was able also to perform. See, what God
[1:10:28] promised, he is also able to perform.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And therefore, it was imputed to him for
[1:10:33] righteousness. Now, it was not written
[1:10:36] for his sake alone that it was imputed
[1:10:38] to him. See, God didn't put this in the
[1:10:41] Bible for Abraham's sake alone.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; He put it to for each one of us to see
[1:10:46] that God was able to do these things.
[1:10:48] And now it was not written for his sake
[1:10:50] alone that it was that it was imputed to
[1:10:53] him, but for us also to whom it shall be
[1:10:56] imputed, if we believe on him that
[1:10:59] raised Jesus Christ, Jesus our Lord from
[1:11:02] the dead, who was delivered from for our
[1:11:05] offenses and was raised again for his
[1:11:07] justification. And if you read down in
[1:11:10] chapter 5, it said, "Therefore, being
[1:11:11] justified by faith, we have peace with
[1:11:14] God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by
[1:11:17] whom also we have access by faith and to
[1:11:20] his grace, wherein we stand and rejoice
[1:11:23] in hope of the glory of God." See, with
[1:11:26] your faith, you have access to God.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; With your faith, you have access to God.
[1:11:32] When you believe in what God is, what
[1:11:35] God tells you, you have a pathway
[1:11:37] straight to him. said, "Lord, it's not
[1:11:39] what I'm standing on. It's that you said
[1:11:41] it and you said, "If I believe in it,
[1:11:44] then that's all that mattered. It it
[1:11:46] didn't matter whether I these are not my
[1:11:48] words, Lord. These are your words." And
[1:11:50] you said that whenever a word was sent
[1:11:52] out of your mouth, when you sent it out,
[1:11:54] it can't return back to you without
[1:11:56] doing nothing. So, if it can't return
[1:11:58] into your void, then something has to
[1:12:00] happen. See, I'm not trusting in my
[1:12:03] ability. I'm not trusting in my
[1:12:04] thoughts. I'm not trusting in what
[1:12:06] somebody told me. I'm trusting in what
[1:12:08] you put in your word. See, that's what
[1:12:10] I'm standing on. And when I stand on it,
[1:12:12] I know that I can't be shaken off of it.
[1:12:15] Cuz this is the only thing that's going
[1:12:16] to stand through the test of time. This
[1:12:19] is the only thing that's going to allow
[1:12:20] you when you get over there. It's the
[1:12:22] only thing that's going to be the that
[1:12:24] you can stand on and say, "Lord, I put
[1:12:26] my faith in your word. I didn't put my
[1:12:28] faith in this one or that one. I put my
[1:12:30] faith in your word, and that's what I'm
[1:12:33] standing on." The same one that same
[1:12:35] message that Paul preached. That's what
[1:12:37] I'm standing on.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Said because when you put your word,
[1:12:42] your faith in him, you can't be shaken.
[1:12:45] You can't be moved. You can't be
[1:12:47] persuaded otherwise because you know
[1:12:49] what you put your faith in.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And when someone comes and tries to push
[1:12:53] you to the side, you say, "No, no, no.
[1:12:55] Uh-uh. This is what I believe."
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I believe in what God said. I believe in
[1:13:00] what he spoke in his word. I believe in
[1:13:02] the thing that's been going on for over
[1:13:04] 6,000 years. And that's what I'm
[1:13:06] standing on. And there ain't no other
[1:13:08] book that we can read that's been going
[1:13:09] on over 6,000 years that has stood this
[1:13:12] long and and stood this test of times
[1:13:14] and and and has been tried over and over
[1:13:17] again and found out to be true.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Said, whether you understand it or not,
[1:13:21] you got to look beyond what you can see.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; You got to look beyond what you can
[1:13:26] feel. You got to look beyond what you
[1:13:29] even understand. And you got to believe
[1:13:31] in something that you can't even see.
[1:13:33] But that's all God asks you to do. All I
[1:13:35] want you to do is believe. Believe in
[1:13:38] me. Believe that I am he. That I am the
[1:13:41] one that comes and that created all
[1:13:43] things. Believe it. And if you believe
[1:13:45] it, all things are possible.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do is believe it.
[1:13:50] Then all things are possible. All things
[1:13:52] are possible. All you got to do is
[1:13:54] believe. I said it's nothing that great.
[1:13:57] It's something that's so simple, but
[1:13:58] people make it so complicated.
[1:14:01] All you have to do is believe. All you
[1:14:04] have to do is say, "Lord, I believe.
[1:14:06] Lord, I believe and all things shall be
[1:14:08] possible." Said, "Can you be shaken?"
[1:14:12] The answer is no. If you got your faith
[1:14:14] in the right thing,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; if you have your faith in the right
[1:14:17] thing, then you can't be shaken. You
[1:14:19] can't be moved.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Said the songwriter said, "I shall not
[1:14:28] be moved." He said, "I'm like a tree
[1:14:30] planted by the rivers of water."
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Said, "I shall not be moved." Let us all
[1:14:35] stand this morning.
[1:14:47] Let us bow.
[1:14:57] Lord Jesus, we come before you this
[1:14:58] morning, Lord. And Lord,
[1:15:02] if there's someone here that said, you
[1:15:04] know,
[1:15:07] I've been struggling with my faith.
[1:15:11] I've been struggling in what I believe.
[1:15:13] I've been struggling with
[1:15:16] going further in the Lord.
[1:15:18] I've been struggling with what I've been
[1:15:21] going through. and the devil has been
[1:15:23] trying to fight me and cause me to
[1:15:25] doubt.
[1:15:27] If that's you this morning, with all
[1:15:29] heads bowed and eyes closed, just lift
[1:15:32] up your hand.
[1:15:34] [music]
[1:15:36] Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:15:39] Lord, you see all the hands that are
[1:15:41] lifted. Lord, you see all the hearts
[1:15:42] that are open this morning. Lord, we ask
[1:15:45] that you come today and Lord, just move
[1:15:47] in such a mighty and a special way.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for being here right
[1:15:53] now. Lord, we ask that you do something
[1:15:55] in someone's life. Do something in
[1:15:57] someone's heart that their faith may
[1:15:59] grow stronger in you this morning. That
[1:16:01] they grow closer to you this morning.
[1:16:03] That their life may be changed further
[1:16:05] and going forward. Lord, we ask that
[1:16:07] you'd move today, Lord. We thank you for
[1:16:10] sending your presence, Lord. Thank you
[1:16:12] for sending your anointing in these
[1:16:14] lives. Lord, we ask that you would allow
[1:16:17] them to grow closer that their faith may
[1:16:18] not be shaken, [music] that they may be
[1:16:21] able to continue to grow and continue to
[1:16:23] move in you. Lord, we ask that you just
[1:16:26] move in a mighty and a special way
[1:16:28] today. In Jesus name we [music] pray.
[1:16:31] Amen.

[1:24:39] through, what the devil has told you,
[1:24:42] but if he told you a lie, you say what

[1:24:47] contrary to the word, you cast out of
[1:24:49] imagination. and everything that exalt
[1:24:52] itself against the word of God. You say
