in the house of the Lord than in the best hospital it is in America hey man it's good to be uh here in South Carolina um tonight we were coming up to preach for brother blue and I said well let me call Brother Simmons it's been a good see brother Jeremiah all the preachers the preachers in the building now y'all made me nervous when I looked up and I see I see preachers I get a little nervous but it's good to see the same let's get our Bibles out tonight but it's good to be here tonight to be in fellowship with you um I tell you when I got here we had a little dilemma the hotels was trying to get paid so they bought me yeah and uh brother Simmons came up there and we were trying to talk him into it and we really want to put the little lady under no type of pressure she boy she was like y'all don't do this to me I'm like what a manager he ran out and left you hole in the bag but uh by the grace of God we was able to get a nice room but it's a real nice room hey man so I appreciate that second Corinthians chapter um 12. um and we want to maybe start at the uh seventh verse but it's just good to be his it's always good to be here it's always good to see uh brother Simmons and his wife and family and uh everybody have it uh let's start at the seventh verse and it says and and at least I should exalt above measured through the abundance of the revelation that was giving me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure and infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecution and distress for Christ's sake for when I'm weak then I'm strong let's bow his gracious father we just thank you tonight for just allowing us to be here to be in the house of the Lord tonight we just pray that father that you just uh use us tonight in some small way to just uh encourage this portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord and that when it's all said and done Lord you can get the glory just hide me behind the cross Lord I'm just a man and uh I just thank you for all things traveling mercies for providing for us today we thank you for all things in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated uh I'd just like to use tonight uh for a little topic what God uses who God uses and how God uses and maybe we'll start out a little slow to kind of give you a little background but Larry always say this um he would always say he's not an evangelist and I'm not quite sure now uh what I am I don't have a church but uh I don't I don't conduct myself and act like an evangelist I'm getting older now brother Jeremiah so I'm I'm learning to take my time you know somebody young they might be up here doing sprints and running through the building but uh you know I got a few years up under me uh now and uh you know after preaching for just about 30 years you you start learning that uh excitement is good and I I enjoy excitement y'all just I normally try to keep my coat on but I'm a little a little warm uh you you find that in 30 years of of uh ministering and and brother Simmons made a statement we was talking for a brief minute in the back he said we we can really see changes around uh around the the word of the hour right uh things aren't like they used to be people don't have a stand the way that they used to have a stand and and we we've seen a lot of people come and we've seen a lot of people go is that right and and so so uh our objective in the hour that that we're in is to try to make sure first and foremost that uh people are are steadfast people are stable I believe that that's the thing that the Apostle Paul taught in the book of Ephesians right he wanted to make sure that the people weren't tossed to and fro you know he wanted to make sure his his ministry was about under the anointing that he ministered under was to make sure that the people got the word right and that that the people were stable that that the people weren't weren't over here this week and over there next week and things of that nature right I believe that the gospel comes to to stabilize us to Anchor us into Faith to to make us uh sure about who we are as individuals that is that right uh wanna before we get started I just kind of want to uh make reference to something that I've preached it several times but uh just felt led to do it again uh uh we must uh have a basis for our stand is that right you it's it's so imperative that that we have a basis for our stand because what we found is so many people said that they believe the word of the hour and and then you know they've they've run and they've jumped and things of that nature now they're not around is that right and and what what that is an indication what that shows is that people weren't really anchored they didn't really have a basis I like something that brother Burley says he always come up with these crazy things he says if if you know people can bring you in with a hamburger somebody can take you out with the state is that right amen if you could be led in with a hamburger somebody could lead you out with a steak right but but if if you're grounded if if you're rooted right then then you you you you won't move is that right when when because things is going to come right you're going to face faith countless challenges right but but no matter what you face as long as you got a basis see you you got to be clear about why you're here right that's that's got to be clear even if you know sometimes people say well they don't run and things of that nature I'm not I'm not worried about whether you run and screaming all of the night I just I just want to drop a few golden nuggets off tonight so that so that you could leave and say you know what uh brother Smiley made a statement I must have a basis for my stand and see I'll quickly say this your basis can't be emotion right you you can't base it on emotions you can't base it upon some sort of feeling or something some Goosebumps we know that brother Brown I'm kind of uh line those things up and and our bases must be the word of God right see we we got to be sound we we got to be sound in this hour not just emotional see I in our emotions our emotions has got to be based upon something that's been quickened to us is that right like brother Bradham say stimulation of Revelation it's the revelation of the word of God that stimulates us and brings forth an emotion is that right not just because everybody in the building waving handkerchiefs I'm reminded of a story that a a sister told long time ago she passed away from uh Trinidad I think brother uh Simmons Lord's sister Joseph she said one time she was she was in church and uh he said this one this one couple had left this one Church to go to this this other church that they thought like we would say they got it going on over there and say and say the the prop the pastor was preaching it and and this is got nothing to do with Ministry it's got to do with you as individuals and so uh she she told me she said uh man the church was lit y'all know what I'm talking about the church was it and say the sister was jumping and and just screaming and pumping a fist and everything and and a husband her husband pulled her down say do you even understand what the man is talking about and she was like he say we going back to our old church right she she because they wanted to be where I was lit right but that wasn't the place where she was growing she was maturing so the man says listen it might be lit here for other folk but for us it's not lit because we're there's no growth and see that there's got to be growth there's got to be maturity there's got to be stability without without question it it's it's a must is that right and so when I was looking at this thought you know some time ago and and especially in today's society where we we find that you know it's it's there's a lot of people who's not really sure especially as it relates to our younger generation and not just young sometimes even us older ones we we come to a place in in our thinking because we're in a battle all the time and the devil brings things to our our minds and and we we get to this this spot where where we feel like we're we're in in some forms we are insufficient but then uh uh for me I just like to be able to look at something uh and see the way that God sees a thing right because a lot of times we look at ourselves and then we we look at other people and we feel like in ourselves as humans and brother Branham did it with a Ministry that went around the world and had discernment and and and and and and broke the word he looked at he looked at Oral Roberts in in all the things that Oral Roberts had and he looked at himself like man I ain't got myself nothing you know I got I got a little a little spot over here in the cut but this guy got a university and and he has this great big office and he has all of this and I could imagine In the Flesh a little depression kind of set in is that right and and God just kind of had to straighten him out like listen you know uh uh that's his portion I'm your portion but that makes the difference church when God's your portion is that right and so you know one of the things that that we have to look at we have to keep in mind that uh the scripture says that we're fearfully and wonderfully made is that right regardless of what anybody says about you what anybody thinks about you you know you may not have as much money as the next person you may not be as educated as the next person you know us as preachers we not may not preach the same has nothing to do with it because because you know what we're fearfully and wonderfully made and and we have our place in the body and I like this the prophet makes a statements say nobody can't take your place see and and that that makes a difference in our understanding when the enemy kind of comes in to try to bombard us with these shallow thoughts because you know we could we could you know become real carnal and Earthly right but we must have a spiritual perspective to combat the enemy when he comes in with carnal thoughts and common way of thinking it's important for you to be able to look at yourself as an individual and understand when God looks at you how God perceives you is that right amen when God saw me and brother Ernest he he knew what brother Ernest would be he knew what I what I would be he and he knew what type of Ministries he would give us is that right so we don't have to fight we don't have to get jealous we don't we don't have to you know and and I can remember when I first started pastoring years ago and uh this is back in the day when Charles pays and brother blue and all of us coming down I remember the first time I heard brother Simmons brother Simmons quoted just about the entire Bible by heart I don't know if he could still do that now he might can at seven he told me he was 70. but he he quoted I'm like this man is a machine and I have to paraphrase and and all of that and brother them brothers would come down and preach and leave the church and and I start crying oh God those Brothers and God just say hi son you gonna be all right you're gonna grow up you just a pup right now amen and if and it seems like they're Dynamic but you're gonna grow up and after a while that came to be the case people people would come in and preach and and and not really know the congregation as well as I did and and I would watch them some people who ain't said amen in six months tell the building down y'all know what I'm talking about right but they didn't know it they was just preaching but you know just that person might have had a spirit against the pastor that didn't make it right at all I was probably trying to do is bring them to a place of perfection right but but the devil had anointed them right but then but then you know as as you growing you're mature and you understand uh your allotment what the thing that's that's been been given to you as an adopted son right then then things don't even matter you you appreciate the word because you realize that iron shopping is iron but we're not in a contest we've been given a commission to perfect the bride right now the preaching contest I'm not I don't come to try to put all the swelling cloaks quotes together to try to make it feel like boy brother smiling deep well what what good is it it you know is brother being deep in everything and you're you're not getting anything you're not you're not being being stable you don't you don't understand you know who you are in in your peculiar I can't say that word to save my life y'all know what I'm talking about peculiarities I get tied tongue on certain words that's one of them huh why why you are so different right well you know uh it's such a so-and-so listen she got her allotment right in the body her place in her adoption her abilities right her inheritances and you got yours you just got to understand what's been given to you what what's your land see what's your land what's been lighted to you like Caleb I think Hebron was given to him see you you just got to know who you are and and what's been given to you and you just gotta be good with that dude and realize if if God has called you right into the body right you got a place you got a position you're needed I'll never tell I'll never tell my my left hand even though I'm right hand and left hand I don't need you it's just as much needed and it's my right hand it may not be able to do what my right hand could do right but but unlimited I just said something see listen church this church is limited when the people don't understand why God has called them to be here right and understand why they're hearing their function you you limit the church when you just really you know when we find people clamoring for positions and jockeying and things of that nature and cut throat and it's not even necessary it's it's not it and you know uh brother Brandon he makes a statement because he was talking about weakness right and and he was saying how much a message like that needed to be preached in the day in time that he preached it especially amongst Pentecostal Pentecostal church right and I believe we are not by denomination y'all know that we clear on that right but but by experience but sometimes you know things like this may seem simplistic but these things need to be preached so that people can be sure about uh who they are and why and why God places him in a place and why God may give this one person a mansion it may not just give you a double but give you a double wide right and you said well I just don't sound like that but people struggle come on people struggle in in these different things is that right I got I got an 11 year old Cadillac and if I drive it to the job everybody just get bent all out of shape and it's sad that you have to explain to people this car got 165 000 miles on it and it's 11 years old right because people aren't sure you know about who they are and and they get carnal and they see something and they like trying to figure it out see you can't curse with God I'm blessed and if God blessed me with with a Rolls-Royce tomorrow right don't ain't no sense again been out of shape just ask me for a ride come on cause his father is for the Believers it's just use useful as long as I got breath when I ain't got no breath anybody can have it don't matter is that right glory to God but see we we get we get envious and jealous over frivolous things is that right things that really don't even matter that much but we just gotta understand you know God got us oh you know y'all on this side of Colombia Colombia is Big too a big old spot and brother Anderson them way over there and you know and and Swansea way down then right but but it's so that you know you're the lighthouse you're the lighthouse in this area is that right glory to God it's not by chance that you're here it was delighted by God predestinated for the foundation of the world right Oh Glory to God you say well you know what we may not have a church full of folk what that got to do with it right because God could fill up a building overnight a blinking a blink of an eye can fill up a building but sometimes God just you know have to uh retrain people reassure people re-establish people because you know sometimes we we we get we get a little carnal or sometimes you know we get a little uh a little amnesia right because we get a little shocked because we're in a battle is that right come on now go back to spiritual Amnesia I'm just gonna I'm just gonna talk preach however I'm doing it tonight but if you want to know something I know where I'm at I think these brothers are straight me out if I go off somewhere right they be looking at you like eagles but I ain't worried about it right because because you know we we all go through things and and you know it's important for people to be in church yeah I don't know Kobe Justin oh Lord exposed folks that's all Kobe did it exposed the real Believers from the make-believers well praise the Lord I ain't gonna get too many witnesses on that one I already know that right but but the True Believer the True Believer is consistent the True Believer understands his position he understands his place right he understands the authority that's been given to him is that right and so like like we were saying brother banham felt he felt the need you know to preach a message of perfect strength by Perfect weakness right uh because sometimes people just feel like you know they're weak and they're in their uh um insufficient and everything but just to try to straighten out like he said to straighten out our thinking and I don't know about you you know I always want my thinking straightened out see I I've in 30 years of preaching I'm not I'm still not above God right glory to God I'm not above God I I want to be able as as I const because it's all growth and it's it's constant maturity I want I want I want to constantly elevate right and and just spiritual things and natural things right I don't want to be so heavily minded I ain't no earthly good come on I remember I remember when I first got saved I realized you know a lot of times folks didn't really have a good good balance right they didn't really have a real good balance because it just just made us if I could use this word y'all forgive me spiritual uh I won't say it but you know we we were so that we was not not really uh functional as it relates to Earthly things right amen glory to God glory to God our mindsets right you know it was all I hate to say things like this but it's in my heart you know and I and I love the revealed word because it's the thing that has made me what I am right but it's other facets of the word that I wish I would have gotten early on you know uh in life that maybe I would be just even sometimes in a better position financially because the the message to me never preached that we had to be broke somebody preach with me that somebody can right and and and you know when I came along I started saying it and see sometimes we clown denomination and things of that nature and then when you look at it you like but but really it's not non-scriptural for people to have businesses and the people people with the right mindset because we do need money in the body of Christ lights ain't gonna get paid by themselves right amen and see for me I never wanted for my children to struggle come on amen you you want I've wanted for my children to be be smart self-reliant come on glory to God glory to God it's it's almost like the that uh Black Wall Street mentality was kind of taken out of the core African-American church and we just we just spiritual you know we on our way to heaven but we on our way to heaven broke and we don't have to be broke preach tonight whether y'all want me to right amen see go back and study this little thought right perfect strength by Perfect weaknesses it's it's in in brother branham's watch this now in his approach was to change the way that we we look at things the way that we look at weakness right because you you look well and we walk around like wowzy wow and Pull Me pro you wait a minute there's no Poe you in the body of Christ come on come on see you're a soldier glory to God and I'm quite sure man they'll root you out in in these branches if you you just piling away and weak and wimpy and all that bro you're gonna get killed and so if you if you'll study it right it's to change our and I got quotes but I'm just gonna preach tonight y'all go back and read come on I already know what's in on the book and then on the tape and then these notes too right but but so so that so that our mindsets listen Church never get complacent come on I don't care I'm 60 years old and I'm not complacent right I mean I'm I'm growing right uh now more than I have in the last year in the last few weeks in in my in my mind in the way that I I look at things and the way that you know I look at my children and and the way the conversations right that that I'm having with them right because sometimes you know uh as parents around the world and we we forgot that we used to drink liquor well praise the Lord and we forgot that we used to smoke weed and we've got we used to do all of these different things because now we holy praise the Lord we Sanctified Holy Ghost Field fire baptized blood running warm in my veins right but we can't even relate to our own unsaved children Lord well Lord help me huh we we don't even know how to relate we don't really know how to communicate right we we don't you know especially us as fathers and let me tell you something it's it's difficult I've learned I was talking to my son and and I just broke down talking to him and I I just I cried because sometimes I look back and I realize as a dad I failed Pastor in a church right you can pass it a church that still failed Moses did right Moses was so caught up in the two million people that had come out in the ministry and everything that he didn't even circumcise his own children his own child right and then the wife got in the wrong spirit when she throwed the bloody bloody uh uh you know foreskin at him right Lord help us Lord help us right and you you could preach the the truth in the revealed word but you can also be missing something right you could be missing something in the same token and and and I realized my son and talking to him he was crying and I was crying right and uh said well yeah I'm a human being they're my children and and I don't want to I don't ever ever want to fail them again right and and he was saying dad I always just wanted to talk to you as my daddy not as my pastor right because sometimes because sometimes as you know when we're looking at everything from a pastor of mine's set we miss things come on and then we you know we have this in our mind because because sometimes people are carnal and people are legalistic as it relates to the scripture in the Bible said this and and it's like we haven't we we have totally totally taken the blood off The Mercy Seat and there's no blood it's it's just all judgment and judgment right and and and sometimes you know and then I just I'm just using I'm using myself as an example and I hope this helped us all in the future right uh there sometimes you know your children just maybe want us to uh put our missionary code up our Pastoria coat our evangelist coach put that up and just be my dad for 10 minutes and and let me let me express myself as your son not not as a a man a congregant right and I tell you what we'll find ourselves we'll find ourselves probably winning our children more so than losing them because because with this spiritual part it should give us wisdom how to break ourselves down because this comes in our adoption right to be to be able to be sensitive enough to the spirit right not leaving the word but not not being self-righteous like we never did nothing all right and see you know I was talking to him and when I started talking to him I could see the spirit raising up because he wanted to be uh confrontational and I said whoa whoa whoa relax right control control the atmosphere right we look creators controlling the atmosphere and say listen I'm not talking to you to try to belittle you to put you down I understand you my child I Know Who You Are right parents sometimes our kids think you me in another form I was you once upon a time so you can't fool me right but I have to you know my kids ain't there around me it's like bro y'all not fooling me y'all my seed I understand you better than you understand yourself and regardless of what you're telling me I know where you're going outside of the new birth you you're gonna go in that same Circle that I went in and you ain't gonna go nowhere come on cause the new birth is the thing that changed to amen the course of my destiny is that right all of us should be able to say Amen to that the new birth a man changed the course of all of our destiny we was all Hellbound some of us wasn't maybe as bad as the other right but we were all on our way to hell but I ain't spin on sidewalk you was on your way to Hell Without this confession without this life without this new birth without this word right but but by by studying by studying the word and understanding what God uses and how God uses and what God uses right God God can't see a lot of times what what we find is and why we don't get the kind of results that we should be getting is because it's just so much of us in the way come on Church it's so much of us when when God God cannot use our human ability right you you if if we look at if we look at Moses right Moses was taught from a child what he you know he was born for right his his mother informed him you were a proper child you was raised up for this purpose him and Pharaoh looked out the same window but but they saw different things right but then but then uh uh Moses tried to get ahead of the thing and and do something and I believe God allowed that to happen so that he could fail Ure to show him that it's not my power I mean it's not by the flesh it's the spirit of God amen is that right he bitterly fell and found himself a runaway prophet see why if he hadn't delivered amen the children of Israel in in human man-made might that would have broke the types of the scripture come on preach with me somebody see because God has identified by his characteristics right and and what God uh displays in the beginning is the standard it's the pattern that he uses Through the Bible right just like back in Genesis with with Cain and Abel if God would have amen accepted the fruits of the field and and all of that he would have had to all the way down through the history of the scriptures amen put the stamp of approval on that is that right but then he would have had to say that Humanity's mentality and ability supersedes a man his mentality his his characteristics his order and and things of that nature is that right he would have had to say that you know what amen uh we need the Holy Ghost for right come on you you we would have had to take all of that out in the Bible right or if it's there it's it's contrasting right because there's the law contrast right and wrong come on good and evil things of that nature then fruits of the field and and the things that we do as human beings would have to be the standard and if that's the standard we gotta Miss we could just got a mess come on come on hello see if if if if the things that we could accomplish are the things that we do in the flesh was the standard we got a mask because God looked down in the Book of Jesus say well I just I'm fixing to whack this thing off cause I'm gonna repent that I even made man because look at what man has done right look at what man has done through human ability apart from God come on y'all want to preach with me now God was so vexed he said well I'll tell you what I just ought to clean this thing on up right come on because look at look at the imagination and we back in Genesis right so so what if what if from the beginning let's go even further back let's let's go back to Adam right when when Adam after amen he fell and and sold fig leaves right and to think about what amen that stood for if that would have been accepted well I'll tell you what it wouldn't even be worth going to church come on y'all don't talk to me come on right it smokes of denominationalism it just speaks to so many different things right but but then you know everything else that that we know is positive would have had to be negatives and I would want to be in the house somewhere never coming out because people would be showing up crazy if nobody had the Holy Ghost nobody no no Holy Ghost to keep these demons at bay you see what you see what the climate was in a day where they didn't have any open Word no profit and and and you know uh everybody was kind of doing what they felt was good in their own sight unfortunately now I thank God that we we have had a prophet we do still have the son of man Ministry right we do have that right and we're part of that we identified but we also are part of that but but think about it right and the other realms right glory to God where where the voice has been rejected look at the climate look at the climate right and and just everything go everything go to God it's it looks it it looks appealing right to the eye like like the service say you know it was a fruit to be designed and look you know Pleasant right even brother Banner brother Banner as he was kind of breaking down the Beast he know he said here's probably you know really handsome guy good on the eyes y'all want to talk to me all right y'all like huh right males and females brother Benham had to put across he wasn't crazy sometimes listen to Listen to brother Banner when he preached and how he describes he describes sometimes sisters he didn't describe him like he was crazy y'all ought to talk to somebody you see he he wasn't that spiritual he was but I mean in this he like man I got to put a cross up here he wouldn't need crosses all through his car now day y'all know to talk to me now come on man he would have to have crosses all around interior right come on come on cause they crazy now realistically realistically to think of to think of the things that men and women put on to come out the door to take pictures in skill in men and and Society is dumbing them down and and I'm I'm an advocate for looking good in style now I know I don't I ain't no antique box you ain't never gonna catch me like that but some of that stuff that you see these guys it's like right I don't know I'm sorry little jacket up here with this long dress on and all that kind of stuff it's like wait a minute wait a minute what are we doing but this but it just kind of shows you you know and the women just coming out but it just shows you prophecy being fulfilled also right and and I thank God for the son of man Ministry because it helps me to rightly divide things and look at things for what it really is and say what it actually is and I thank God for these brothers who who's not ashamed of the Gospel right that that's that understands the difference between wrong and right right because amen you know this world is is in a mess and and you realistically has to pity don't ever let the people of the world put a Pity Spirit on you where boy y'all going over there the brother Henry Simmons church and y'all be right out here wearing them skirts and boy and all that man you ought to just be proud as you want to be show layers you're outside I am praise the Lord you're not going to talk me into a short skirt come on tight skit down you know and they used to wear these them leotard things y'all know what I'm on my they used to wear that stuff back in the day up underneath something now they come out and they be out in 20 degree 10 degree weather in that stuff in a coat where the rest of your clothes at it's cold outside last time here brother Jack and my wife and uh sister Erica we got there we went to we went to uh Arizona we had a meeting over there and man they were kind of chilling I ain't doing today they were prancing through there every little little leotard thing I just like this is absolutely crazy it just shows you it shows you why this thing got to be burnt off but then it it just really shows you if you try to bring that in the church God can't use that now remember what we're talking about what God uses right how God uses see God God that's why we needed a restoration right to set things in order because the religious World down Through the Ages was you know they had reformers right but they never lived long enough to move into another age and bring forth another portion of light right but then but then when the founders go off then they denominate they stop instead of moving on right and see even with Pentecostals under the restoration of the gifts right the Pentecostal Church Great Revival my grandmothers and uncles and all of them they came up Church of God Church of God in Christ and and all of those different churches man I'm quite sure they doing somersaults looking at the church now right and think about what brother Branham said he said in a hundred years he say the Pentecostal Church will be worse than the Catholic Church are y'all gonna talk to me look at look at look at the prophecy right and and you have to ask yourself the question if if we've been restored back right to the original work the original faith holy decency and all of that can God use that only in a permissive will it's permissive at best it ain't perfect because that which is perfect has come right the intelligence of God is here and everything you know uh that's in part should be done away with it right as far as I'm concerned but you see we're best about how you say it say that you know they're getting people and they're doing this and probably yeah it is permissively right but I want to be in God perfect Wilson solutions to say in your that's where I want to be Lord all right that's where I want to be look and she are going all right that's where y'all want to be Lord y'all didn't come to have church with me that's huh y'all just got to follow me rock with me when I rock if I'm rocking y'all mother that's where I want to be Lord in your perfect right not in the permissive will see God didn't change his mind about his word when it came down to uh balam right no men no right well you know he said no but just maybe let me go ask him again no he ain't changed his mind okay you're gonna go anyway and since you're gonna go anyway going on but she'll never be able to curse him right no no matter no matter no matter how you dislike them right no matter how you dislike them no matter you know because uh what I gotta think now balac was the King right they took him up and showed beta look at this look at them people man don't want to be God's people just show them the high parts right amen he what what that meant he just showed them all of all of their wrongs God I was like I already I already know that that telling me nothing new but you still cannot curse them right you know it ain't like God don't know us but what God has blessed nobody can't curse and what God cursed nobody came bless is that right if you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world God don't see your little minor mistake because he know you're gonna make those things right the Holy Ghost will were you huh so after a while you be sitting there you just get to telling on yourself and confessing and making things right if you got the Holy Ghost if you were in the mind of God is that right because because those are the kind of people that God uses how much time I got see God God uses God uses people that I feel is that right God uses people that has a life is that right God uses people that are humble is that right God uses people and things right that that you know has mastered human ability that understands it's got to be God oh it won't work if it ain't God it won't work if it ain't God operating this gift it won't work it will not produce the results is that right I'm glad I ain't all I'm I'm not illiterate like I used to tell the church now I may not be as smart as some folk but don't don't play with me God it will kind of intellectually hurt your feeling I think that part of me will come alive I I mean I ain't been to school in a long time but every now and then it's surfaces to let intellects appear you ain't that smart it just take me a minute to to get a hold of that big words you might have used but once I'm able to break it down or I'm riding with you baby come on come on it's true anyhow amen that's the truth anyhow I see it I gotta know and that makes me my time to go law hey I feel good now how did I can't come up here hey what it's a good atmosphere up in here now you know y'all may not be running all around around the building but it's the kind of atmosphere that that I can break into things right and and show us things by the spirit about about a message not not just reading a quote no wrong with reading the quote sometime I read sometime I don't but I know what's in my heart already I already know I know it's it I just studied for 30 years I already know what brother Brandon talk sometimes when I really really want you to get the um of what he said I might read but I already know what he said cause I've been studying and I understand the spirit behind it what is he trying to do what by this word he's trying to produce see in perfect strength and I'm gonna go and perfect strip but he's trying to change the way that we we think the way that we look at things help us to see this is how God sees you it's it's the weak and and and and those types of individuals that God uses on the front line to get the job done that is a quote right and so when we well I'm so no no no you just write for God and see in that same message brother Brandon tried to encourage the young ministers right Amen in the young lady to stay humble because we you know what I'm just gonna say this we're living in a generation now where this I I don't know what day is now uh what y'all help me uh what's the generation supposed to be now because they they change so much X uh whatever ZZ I don't know what they is my my son them at one point they was talking about their little generation is uh well I can't think good now right and they had this little attitude going where the where the this and we don't we don't we don't y'all just disrespectful that's just how all you might as well say y'all disrespectful y'all don't y'all don't respect authority come on y'all try to uh you serve position right with a little bit of knowledge you know more than the people walking around like man sit down he used to be tired I used to just hey you know I'm glad I got a good spirit about that I didn't want sit out of the house chew and you ain't that deep I can't stand people to think that they so smart and they're so deep and you don't know nothing that insults my integrity my righteous indignation Rises up sit down somewhere because you ain't special you ain't all that right and people be pumping them need to stay on his knees is that right before the devil tricking come on come on look what he said go back and read it he was talking to young lady members and all because he's saying the man who think that he can get the job done he can't get the job done if he feel like he could pull it off ain't gonna do nothing but make a mess that's the Bible right but but it's it's that it's that one little brother that come in with with you know sometimes little suit and a little cold up to the side he's sitting in the cut and you don't think he nothing right in the moment God touch him again you'll be like yeah that one you ain't thinking nothing right amen because sometimes you know you you look at this maybe my last statement you you think about when when God said you know the prophet uh uh to to uh get one of uh Jesse's Sons right and boy all these Big Fellas come out right man real big Scrappy handsome fellows and all that they're all wouldn't even come out huh he pranced all them fellas through there no all came out nowhere the prophet said I know he told me to come down here uh do you have another son he had to think about it it seemed like yeah we where are you at he out there with the Sheep he ain't much of nothing but yeah you know he probably ain't much doing because the daddy was looking at all these boys like they was his pride and joy right they was in the Army come on they were supposed to be Warriors and David out there killing animals bears and lions right glory to God they go get David and the oil just come running I'm quite sure daddy was sitting there dumbfounded but that meets in the characteristics of God God hidden and revealing simplicity and then and then and then you know he sent David out there to the battle right and and told him take this out there to your brothers and them you know they they see him coming once you come out here to spy on us right now they back up in the cut scared all of the big handsome boys right supposed to be Warriors and the King had his shoulders Above the Rest huh had to be bowed out by a little Ruddy fella with the spirit of God on it huh so so I I'll say this I made a statement I made a statement uh a couple of weeks ago in Sarasota and I was telling I was telling the parents don't ever don't ever uh uh size up your children and and and put one child over the next child because he seems like he may be a little bit more than the next child we're fearfully and wonderfully made God made us different you can't point at that child and say you need to be like him he cannot be like him he was never made to be like him right and and all you you'll do is is cause trauma in the child's life trying to get that child to be something he was never ordained to be huh I'm telling you I could preach that now I got five boys right and and you know my oldest he is what he is right and and you know he was always that one you know it was out there and and you look at this this one here and you say it'd be no no no no no he don't he fearfully and wonderfully made he'll find himself he'll come to himself he'll find out what he good at because he may not be good at what this one good at because he was never ordained to be that and we cause trauma and man I came outside brother ran up to me he said boy brother Smiley he said boy I was so glad you preached that he said because the very thing I was getting ready to do I was getting ready to tell my other two boys y'all need to be like y'all Big Brother he not the standard you're not stand it it no he's not amen because they individuals so he cannot be the standard right he can only be himself right come come to to a spot as an individual but but you you can't just look at the rest of the children boy y'all ain't by nothing right and not be the very one to leave home and never think about you never call you on the phone y'all notice y'all know heard ever heard one of them Shirley Caesar songs y'all ought to talk to me I'm gonna go huh she told she told us the story about that's my mama huh the the the mama was staying with the son you know they had a little change in his you know they were a little uppity little uppity wife and everything y'all don't talk to him I'm fixing to go help me get on out of here come on I look up any wife and everything and and Grandmama was speaking bad bad grandma I hope they I hope they let my grandchild come around me because I ain't sophisticated I just look all right in a suit but I ain't sophisticated [Music] and and and and they like man we got to take yeah we got all that bad Grandma man we trying to raise our children a certain way and not realizing Grandma I'm gonna tell you something grandmothers have something that you can't get in a book especially them old grandmamas right they you know in golly grandmamas and and the one that he was in trouble all the time and he ain't had that much and everything he rode around there and he caught him on the way to taking it to a little assisted living facility wait a minute what y'all finna doing mama man mama got bad Grandma around here man but I thought oh well that's that rubbing off on my chilling man we finna get Grandmama gone huh oh wait a minute wait a minute now mama let me check to you I may not have a big house I may not have all of that but you're welcome to come stay with me huh amen it's the truth anyhow you know sometimes sometimes it might be that that that little one that don't seem like nothing to be there where you get good and old and can't hardly make it that'll be there Amen to you to you marching the glory is that right and sometime the one with all of the education and all of the money not saying that's all together true all the time so let me straighten that out but but I I will say this as parents don't ever do that don't don't ever don't ever tell us one child you need to be like your brother you need to now help help them to find out what they good at and and work with them till they perfect what they're good at right and then they'll they'll be happy and you'll be happy amen y'all a little Lord tonight amen let's

to save themselves maybe I get baptized maybe I'll do this I'll do that but if you could have done anything to save ourselves Jesus wouldn't have had that he wouldn't have had to die but the reason he died because we need the blood of Jesus amen he can't he's the savior and I just try to stress that he's the Savior and you let nothing take the place of the blood of Jesus nothing takes the place of the Cross all you got to do to accept what he's done and if you accept what he's done then you've received amen your deliverance your salvation whatever the need is Jesus did it for you all you got to
