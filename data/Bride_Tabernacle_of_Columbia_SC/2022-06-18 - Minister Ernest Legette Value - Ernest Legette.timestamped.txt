[33:14] god is good amen
[33:16] we want to look at the book of isaiah by
[33:18] the grace of god
[33:19] won't be before you long isaiah 55
[33:23] very familiar scripture amen
[33:28] tonight i want to
[33:29] start on a little topic
[33:32] i entitled it value amen
[33:36] value isaiah 55 and 1. if you got it say
[33:40] amen
[33:42] and it reads
[33:44] ho
[33:45] everyone that thirst has come
[33:48] ye to the waters and he
[33:51] that have no money
[33:53] come by
[33:54] come here by and eat
[33:56] yay come buy wine
[33:58] and milk without money without price you
[34:01] may be seated tonight
[34:04] although saying sunday
[34:06] he said come on are you calling for all
[34:08] the broke people
[34:10] amen
[34:11] i said i'm in that number
[34:13] you look at the price of things today we
[34:15] broke
[34:16] i was telling brother jeremiah yesterday
[34:19] uh uh how i think it was yesterday or
[34:21] day before the price of stuff is just
[34:23] outrageous hey that
[34:25] stuff the part costs five dollars say it
[34:28] cost 21 no
[34:30] that's quadruple what the what the price
[34:32] that was just last year 21 dollars now
[34:35] so we're looking at what are we looking
[34:36] at inflation
[34:38] but i'm so glad tonight that god ain't
[34:40] concerned about your money
[34:42] he said i want you to come and buy he
[34:43] says oh you that don't have no money
[34:46] come on
[34:47] i said who ain't got no money tonight
[34:51] he asking you to come amen
[34:53] he says wherefore do you spend money for
[34:56] that which is not bread
[34:58] and your labor for that which satisfies
[35:00] not we're talking about value tonight
[35:04] he says you're laboring for stuff that
[35:05] ain't satisfied
[35:07] why you say it ain't satisfying because
[35:09] tomorrow you're gonna have to get more
[35:10] ain't it
[35:12] you're gonna have to get more the next
[35:14] day so he says you're doing all that for
[35:16] stuff that ain't satisfying but he said
[35:18] you come to me all of you that's broke
[35:21] they don't have no money come on and i'm
[35:23] gonna give you a i'm gonna give you a
[35:24] satisfying portion
[35:26] that you don't have to come back and ask
[35:27] for no more how many want that tonight
[35:30] i don't know about you but i'm glad
[35:32] tonight that i could say i found that
[35:33] satisfying portion
[35:35] you know what alcohol couldn't do
[35:37] what drugs couldn't do come on what
[35:40] women or men you say can't do god could
[35:43] do those things
[35:44] how many believe that
[35:46] god gives you that satisfying portion
[35:48] that's what it is you know it's a lot of
[35:50] people today they go to church but they
[35:52] ain't satisfied
[35:53] they still got voids that they got to
[35:55] use everything else to feel those voids
[35:58] because they hadn't found that
[35:59] satisfying portion
[36:01] but i think about that woman at the well
[36:03] she was going to the well but yet she
[36:05] was looking for a satisfied portion was
[36:07] she because she says that we know that
[36:09] when the messiah come he'll tell us
[36:10] these things so she was already
[36:12] testifying that she was looking for him
[36:14] wasn't she but she hadn't found them yet
[36:16] but when she found that satisfying
[36:18] portion that's what she was looking for
[36:20] and i say that today a lot of people
[36:22] come to church and they empty come on
[36:26] they empty
[36:27] they ain't satisfied yet and that's why
[36:29] they're miserable
[36:30] that's why you know like the song says i
[36:32] don't know what you came to do
[36:34] that's why they they can't praise god
[36:36] they can't enter in why because they
[36:38] ain't found that but once you found that
[36:40] satisfying portion
[36:42] i don't care if you're tired if you're
[36:44] weak
[36:44] headache come on i was telling them the
[36:47] the day i worked till 8 30 last night
[36:50] and got out six o'clock today but i'm
[36:52] still running for jesus come on why
[36:54] because he is my satisfying portion
[36:57] i love the presence of god i don't know
[36:59] about you but it's something about when
[37:00] the presence of god swoop down on you

[37:04] knocked out but the presence of god give
[37:06] you energy like you ain't never had
[37:08] before how many believe that
[37:10] come on so i said that that's what it is
[37:13] you know i was i was laying on the couch
[37:14] the other day and and the lord began
[37:17] speaking to me in my spirit he began to
[37:19] say i knew you
[37:21] come on he says before you was born i
[37:23] knew you
[37:25] i knew you then he started letting me
[37:27] see all of my life flash before me and
[37:30] all of my ways but then i hear hear i
[37:33] can hear them say to my spirit
[37:35] but i knew you
[37:37] and i knew that one day
[37:39] i would call you and you would answer
[37:42] he said i knew i already knew you i
[37:45] began to raise my hands and say god i
[37:47] thank you
[37:48] i ain't even thought about you but lord
[37:50] you knew me
[37:51] for i when i didn't know you god said i
[37:54] knew you
[37:55] and i knew who you were i knew your name
[37:58] i don't care how much the devil had you
[38:00] bound and sin and chains

[38:04] god god said i knew you
[38:06] come on and i i don't matter the devil
[38:08] the accuser was accusing you but i knew
[38:10] who you was
[38:12] and i knew that one day when i called
[38:14] you you was gonna answer the call
[38:16] you was gonna let go of everything else
[38:18] that that had value or you thought you
[38:20] had value in your life because when i
[38:23] called you i knew you
[38:24] hallelujah
[38:26] oh jesus
[38:27] something began ringing out of my spirit
[38:30] i said god thank you for knowing me
[38:32] thank you
[38:34] hallelujah for counting me valuable how
[38:37] many believe that tonight oh jesus i
[38:40] said value i'm gonna get all over myself
[38:42] i say you know you valuable to god
[38:43] tonight i don't care what the devil's
[38:45] saying about you you valuable to god
[38:47] come on you you mean so much to god you
[38:50] let me tell you how much how much you
[38:51] worth to god use words so much that he
[38:53] was willing to shed his own blood come
[38:55] on he and paul said it like this i
[38:57] believe he said be careful of how you
[39:00] handle the flock of god come on
[39:02] which the holy ghost has made you
[39:04] oversee as he said because god has
[39:06] purchased them come on with his own
[39:08] blood hallelujah god thought she was
[39:11] worth it didn't he he thought she was he
[39:13] you were so valuable to god that he says
[39:15] how much is the cost hallelujah nobody
[39:18] couldn't pay the cost
[39:20] but he said that he the only one he the
[39:22] sin demanded justice come on but god had
[39:25] the answer
[39:27] god paid the price didn't he come on you
[39:29] was that much you was that valuable to
[39:31] god that god paid the price for you come
[39:33] on and then he he give him a charge and
[39:35] say touch not my anointing come on do my
[39:38] prophets no harm hallelujah they belong
[39:40] to me they're mine oh jesus come on
[39:44] oh thank the lord
[39:46] hallelujah aren't you glad tonight that
[39:48] god purchased you with his own blood
[39:50] come on you are valuable to god i said a
[39:53] lot of times the thing is as we talking
[39:55] about value tonight come on a lot of
[39:57] times you know like he says you paying
[39:59] money for that that don't satisfy you
[40:01] laboring for that ain't satisfying you
[40:02] know he says but come you know a lot of
[40:05] times we pay a lot of money for a lot of
[40:07] things
[40:08] but it don't mean nothing does it but
[40:10] but salvation is free tonight you know
[40:12] salvation is free
[40:14] god ain't charging you a dime for it is
[40:16] he he's saying come ye without money and
[40:18] that's what you try to convince people
[40:20] come on the devil beating you down
[40:23] ain't the devil beat you enough come on
[40:25] ain't you been bound enough
[40:27] come on you know we can't say that that
[40:29] seeing ain't pleasures because the bible
[40:31] says
[40:32] that moses chose not to enjoy the
[40:34] pleasures of sin i mean he chose to be
[40:36] called a not be called a son of
[40:38] pharaoh's daughter come on but to go out
[40:41] there and be with those that were
[40:44] slaves or whatever they call it because
[40:46] he chose not to enjoy the pleasant sin
[40:47] for a season didn't he come on because
[40:50] it's joyous it's pleasure just for a
[40:52] season though come on
[40:54] but what comes in the bible says that
[40:56] the wages of sin come on
[40:59] sin got value to it don't it
[41:01] the wages of it is death
[41:04] i don't know i don't care how many times
[41:06] you know you see that people walk down
[41:08] the same path we know what the end is
[41:10] going to be
[41:11] don't you
[41:12] because you've seen it over and over and
[41:14] over again
[41:15] but what it is is things that entices
[41:17] people you know i was listening to
[41:19] something
[41:20] probably god was talking about
[41:22] how
[41:23] you know people were born when you're
[41:24] born into this world you you the nature
[41:27] that's in you is is the world and
[41:31] it loves that the nature that your
[41:33] nature has seen you loves the world the
[41:35] things the world is be appeasing to you
[41:37] because that's the nature that you were
[41:38] born with come on no matter how good you
[41:41] try to raise that child no matter how
[41:43] you raise that child and keep them away
[41:45] from certain things the things of the
[41:46] world always appeal to them because
[41:48] that's the nature that they were born
[41:50] with
[41:51] but god knows that you know and that's
[41:54] why he says you must be born again
[41:56] until they get the new nature things of
[41:59] the world gonna always appeal to him so
[42:01] that does more than all of our talk and
[42:03] all of our restrictions and all those
[42:05] things come on it's going to always be
[42:07] appealing to them the only time that
[42:10] those things won't appeal to them come
[42:12] on is when they when they get that born
[42:13] again experience
[42:15] when the holy ghost comes in
[42:17] and that means you know a lot of times i
[42:20] say that today people don't talk about
[42:22] that no more all they say come on but
[42:24] have you been born again
[42:26] come on
[42:27] you got to get to that place the way you
[42:29] ain't worried about the world and those
[42:32] things don't entice you
[42:34] because you got something better than
[42:35] what the world has to offer
[42:37] you taste it and you saw that the lord
[42:39] was good
[42:41] hallelujah y'all feel all right tonight
[42:43] come on i don't know about you i said
[42:45] but i tasted it come on
[42:47] and saw that the lord is good i was
[42:49] sharing sunday how the boys at work
[42:52] one of the guys friend of mine say
[42:54] earnest it's my birthday come on i want
[42:56] you just come out and we're going to be
[42:57] down at the pool hall come home

[43:02] you don't do none of that come on just
[43:03] come out just have a good time with us
[43:05] come on you ain't going to do nothing
[43:07] but go home and sit on the porch
[43:10] or maybe go take a nap come on i says
[43:12] but the thing about it is i got
[43:14] something greater than the pool hall
[43:16] greater than sitting around talking
[43:18] about yeah when i sit on the porch
[43:20] that's when i'm meditating with god come
[43:22] on that's when god comes down to speak
[43:24] to me and i can hear him say i knew you
[43:26] hallelujah oh jesus
[43:29] you can't hear that in the pool hall can
[43:31] you
[43:31] [Laughter]
[43:33] god is so good amen i said value i know
[43:36] getting all over myself said what it is
[43:38] come on you asking us to come
[43:40] you know it says without money without
[43:42] price come on
[43:44] everything in this world today is
[43:46] dictated by money
[43:47] come on
[43:49] you get treated a certain way when you
[43:50] got a certain
[43:52] money certainly you get treated a
[43:53] certain way you get better service when
[43:55] you got more money
[43:56] come on
[43:57] you get access look like to to better
[44:00] things when you have more money
[44:02] but it's something about it
[44:04] you know
[44:05] money money is is something that
[44:08] you know the love of it is the root of
[44:10] all evil it ain't money but it's a love
[44:12] of it
[44:13] right
[44:14] so we find today
[44:16] everything is dictated by money come on
[44:19] i was speaking at my dad's name i was
[44:20] telling him he was like man gas five
[44:22] dollars a gallon i said good we about to
[44:25] save money well how you gonna save money
[44:27] cause we ain't gonna be just out there
[44:28] riding around
[44:30] we're gonna be at the house now
[44:32] right
[44:33] spending some family time together
[44:36] praying meditating on the lord because
[44:38] we can't afford to just ride around now
[44:41] get in the car and go there but what it
[44:42] is i ain't worried about that
[44:43] everything's dictated by money come on
[44:46] got to work a little extra got dudes
[44:47] right here now to pay these bills but
[44:50] you know the price is going to keep
[44:51] going up
[44:52] not just with gas food everything price
[44:55] is just going to keep skyrocketing
[44:58] come on we're looking at it today
[45:01] on the job things that you could use to
[45:03] get overnight you can't get it overnight
[45:05] now four weeks six weeks and it's ten
[45:07] times more than what it was
[45:09] come on but what it is squeeze coming on
[45:12] the whole world
[45:14] but what is it doing it's pushing us i
[45:16] don't know about you but it should be
[45:17] pushing you that closer to god
[45:19] we ain't concerned about these things
[45:22] because we know that our god come on our
[45:25] father owns every cattle on the hill
[45:29] he ain't dictated by money come on
[45:32] without money without price
[45:35] hallelujah
[45:36] oh jesus
[45:38] i said what it is value come on
[45:40] we look at it we can look at it from so
[45:42] many different angles i said the thing
[45:44] is a lot of things that we count
[45:45] valuable don't really mean nothing come
[45:47] on it's going to be ashes after a while
[45:50] come on ain't going to be nothing
[45:52] but what's value what's the real value
[45:54] tonight real value is in your soul where
[45:56] you going to spend eternity at come
[45:58] on you can't value in this life come on
[46:02] hear the day gone tomorrow
[46:04] friend of mine now in the hospital you
[46:07] know having some issues and he knows
[46:09] he's afraid and all these things but
[46:10] what it is you might value your life but
[46:12] tomorrow you might wake up something
[46:14] else something wrong
[46:15] come on so what it is where is it where
[46:17] is the real value what means more to you
[46:20] than anything
[46:21] come on
[46:22] i said your soul out to me more than you
[46:24] than anything
[46:26] come on we all walked that way we've
[46:27] been teenagers before all these things
[46:30] and look look what happened time goes on
[46:32] come on
[46:33] and it's gonna keep going on you ain't
[46:35] gonna be able to get that one day back
[46:37] but it's a blessing when you can look
[46:39] back at your youth and say i thank god
[46:41] that i gave him my life when he called
[46:44] on me i didn't understand it even right
[46:46] right then right away but i'm glad that
[46:49] i had the ability
[46:51] to hear that call i'm glad i had the
[46:54] courage to walk away from everything
[46:56] else that people are picking at you
[46:58] laughing at you i'm glad i had the
[47:00] courage
[47:01] god gave it to you
[47:03] amen
[47:04] me and brother damon was telling
[47:06] my son moses the other day
[47:08] how how rough i had it
[47:11] when the lord called me
[47:12] and how the people picked at me and
[47:14] laughed at me i said but god gave you
[47:16] the courage to stand
[47:18] i didn't even know what it was all about
[47:20] but something greater was calling on me
[47:22] come on god just allow you to see your
[47:25] life and where it was going the path
[47:27] that it was headed down but he gave you
[47:29] an option
[47:31] he gave you a choice
[47:33] hallelujah and i'm so glad tonight that
[47:36] i made the right choice
[47:38] and that's what we try to tell people
[47:40] today that's what all our minister and
[47:42] crying out is about
[47:43] make the right choice
[47:45] make god your choice
[47:47] don't be like the young rich ruler come
[47:50] on
[47:51] he wanted eternal life but he didn't
[47:53] want to give up
[47:54] what he thought was valuable he didn't
[47:57] know what real value was
[47:59] hallelujah
[48:01] but maybe he found out one day
[48:03] when he lifted up his eyes come on oh
[48:06] jesus
[48:08] i said god is good tonight
[48:10] value come on i said what what's what's
[48:13] the real value come on i was thinking
[48:15] about you know like i'm saying on sunday
[48:17] i said the thing is we don't we as
[48:21] as a people sometimes we don't know what
[48:23] real value is
[48:25] i liken it to a carpenter
[48:27] that says or
[48:29] some remodel or something might look at
[48:31] old house
[48:32] beat down flow falling in ceiling
[48:34] falling in
[48:36] and all these things and
[48:37] then he might
[48:38] somebody might say they want twenty
[48:40] thousand for it
[48:42] you say it ain't worth twenty thousand
[48:44] it depends on who looking at it
[48:47] to what the value of it is
[48:50] because the person that's looking at it
[48:51] got to have a vision for it come on
[48:54] got to know what the potential of it is
[48:57] and that's what it is when it comes down
[48:59] to you and in our lives come on
[49:02] the world i don't know about you but
[49:04] they throw me away long time ago
[49:06] you didn't have no value when you
[49:08] couldn't give to them no more when you
[49:11] couldn't uh support them no more come on
[49:13] when you didn't when you wasn't worth it
[49:15] come on because you washed up somebody
[49:17] else new on the scene now come on they
[49:19] got a new friend now
[49:21] you lost your value
[49:23] come on but it ain't so with god
[49:26] hallelujah even with him his value he
[49:30] gets better all the time
[49:32] he never loses his value come on
[49:35] but i said that the right person looking
[49:37] at it he can see the potential in it can
[49:39] he come on now he might have to rip the
[49:41] floors out the remainder that's left the
[49:44] little that's left he might have to rip
[49:45] that out come on but he gonna start over
[49:48] new
[49:49] the roof that's leaking somebody said
[49:51] well we can just patch it up come on but
[49:53] i don't believe god does no patch up
[49:55] work
[49:56] come on you tear that roof out and put a
[49:58] new one down come on
[49:59] all things become new right god don't do
[50:02] patch up work he don't just put you on a
[50:04] new leaf but when god get done with you
[50:07] you brand new come on
[50:08] you might have been one thing one day
[50:10] but tomorrow you brand new because god's
[50:13] gotta hold to you hallelujah you're
[50:16] walking in newness of life you walking
[50:18] with your head up because you know where
[50:20] you had it at that's because god doesn't
[50:22] gotta hold to you hallelujah oh jesus i
[50:26] thank god you know i said what it is
[50:28] value come on you got to realize the
[50:30] value
[50:32] come on what real value is
[50:34] come on
[50:36] you got to realize
[50:38] what real value is
[50:41] what the potential is come home
[50:43] what you living for now is it going to
[50:45] be worth it remember everything gets old
[50:47] everything starts to fade away come on
[50:50] but with god he get better all the time
[50:51] don't he
[50:53] a reminder
[50:54] stirred up i was sharing with my grandma
[50:57] and i closed i didn't want to be long
[50:58] tonight about sharing my grandma we went
[51:01] up to the mountains

[51:08] so i pulled the pictures up and i began
[51:10] to show her i said we up on the

[51:50] got old
[51:52] that's one thing in her life that never
[51:54] got boring
[51:55] that that she never got tired of come on
[51:58] that makes her stronger every day she
[52:00] might be talking about how her knees
[52:02] hurting her leg hurt but then you begin

[52:17] wave in her hand and say thank and then
[52:18] the quickening power might hit her and
[52:20] she just getting moving and jerking i

[54:01] he said well how far is it
[54:02] so
[54:04] only about a mile he said y'all like to
[54:05] be able to do that i said we tried

[54:19] way

[54:22] up the mountain the ladies say come down
[54:25] she said it's benches all up down here
[54:27] she said about every so many feet you
[54:29] need to use them
[54:32] i didn't know what she was talking about
[54:34] till we got a little further down
[54:36] that i had to sit down but the lord
[54:38] began speaking to me he said you know
[54:40] whoever created this path they knew it
[54:41] was gonna be a hard path
[54:43] they knew you weren't gonna be able to
[54:44] walk it all in one stroke so they made
[54:46] provision for you to sit down and rest a
[54:48] little while
[54:49] and i started thinking about this
[54:51] journey come on that we on going to
[54:53] glory hallelujah come on god i was

[59:01] painting
[59:02] that's what it was it's undescribable
[59:05] come on eyes ain't seen

[59:20] at the promised land
[59:21] or jesus where are you standing on the
[59:23] mountain weeping over jerusalem come on
[59:25] you know the lord began speaking to me
[59:28] but you know and i ain't trying to be
[59:30] super spiritual nothing i was just
[59:31] stirred
[59:33] because god i said god a lot of times in
[59:35] the natural garb he wanted to speak to
[59:37] us
[59:38] you know you could have had your
[59:38] headphones on listening to music going
[59:40] around you and i heard god come on
[59:42] but god want to speak to you
[59:44] even with these natural things that's
[59:46] going on to show you things in the
[59:48] spirit realm come on that'll encourage
[59:51] you just as you know the things in the
[59:52] spirit spiritual realm are more real
[59:54] than the things that are natural you say
[59:56] how that because we know that everything
[59:58] we see was made by the things that we
[59:59] can't see come on all of this is a
[1:00:02] product of the spoken word of god so
[1:00:04] those are the things that's real those
[1:00:06] are things that's eternal come on but i
[1:00:08] said you got to press your way how many
[1:00:10] feel like pressing they way come on
[1:00:12] i said it's a steep climb come on
[1:00:15] it's a hard climb but don't let nobody
[1:00:17] turn you around
[1:00:18] come on
[1:00:19] amen

[1:06:06] tonight as we read from first
[1:06:08] corinthians
[1:06:10] 13 i mean 11
[1:06:13] 23.
[1:06:15] we appreciate the lord appreciate the
[1:06:17] word
[1:06:19] savage is going to have communion feet
[1:06:21] watching we're just going to have
[1:06:22] communion tonight
[1:06:23] but we thank god for you coming
[1:06:29] it says
[1:06:30] here
[1:06:35] for i have received the lord that which
[1:06:38] also i delivered unto you
[1:06:40] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:06:43] which he
[1:06:44] was betrayed took bread
[1:06:47] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:06:50] and said
[1:06:51] take eat
[1:06:53] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:06:56] this doing remember to me
[1:06:59] after the same matter also he took the
[1:07:01] cup
[1:07:03] and when he had sucked sand
[1:07:05] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:07:06] blood
[1:07:08] this new year is often as you drink it
[1:07:10] in remembrance of me
[1:07:13] as often as ye eat this bread and drink
[1:07:16] this cup you do show the lord's death
[1:07:18] till he come
[1:07:20] wherefore
[1:07:22] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:07:25] this cup of the lord unworthy shall be
[1:07:28] guilty of
[1:07:30] the body
[1:07:32] and the blood of the lord
[1:07:34] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:07:37] him eat
[1:07:39] of that bread and drank up that cup
[1:07:44] for he that eaten and drank and unworthy
[1:07:47] eaten the drinking damnation to himself
[1:07:51] not discerning the lord's body
[1:07:53] but this caused
[1:07:55] many are weak
[1:07:57] and sickly among you and many sleep
[1:08:00] for if
[1:08:03] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:08:06] be judged
[1:08:09] but when we are judged
[1:08:12] we are chastened
[1:08:14] of the lord
[1:08:15] that we should not be condemned
[1:08:18] with the world
[1:08:20] wherefore my brethren
[1:08:22] when you come together to eat terry one
[1:08:24] for another
[1:08:26] if any man hunger
[1:08:27] let him eat at home
[1:08:29] that you come not together until
[1:08:32] condemnation
[1:08:34] and the rest will i set in order when i
[1:08:37] come
[1:08:38] we thank the lord
[1:08:41] the lives we sing in him we get prepared
[1:08:44] thank god for you
[1:08:46] by the grace of god
[1:08:49] the blood brother going
[1:08:51] sing or something
[1:08:54] god is good amen
[1:08:58] you know one one person said
[1:09:01] you said you're damn if you
[1:09:03] eat unworthy and you're damn if you
[1:09:05] don't eat
[1:09:08] so there's no getting away from him
[1:09:12] we aren't to take communion
[1:09:14] and if we don't take communion he said
[1:09:16] you have no part with me
[1:09:18] isn't that right
[1:09:21] so what happens is
[1:09:23] people try to escape it
[1:09:25] and there are others that
[1:09:28] don't deserve the law of the body but
[1:09:30] what we got to realize
[1:09:33] that we make a
[1:09:35] a commitment to christ
[1:09:37] and we dedicate our lives to him
[1:09:40] communion is showing the lord that
[1:09:43] i've done that
[1:09:45] i've given my life to you and i come
[1:09:49] to recognize his dying
[1:09:52] because i've died to myself also
[1:09:56] are you with me
[1:09:58] so we're fellowshipping with him
[1:10:01] and remembering what he did for us
[1:10:05] are you with me
[1:10:06] and god bless you
[1:10:08] again get ready
[1:10:10] oh
[1:10:11] the blood
[1:10:12] of jesus
[1:10:17] oh
[1:10:18] the blood
[1:10:19] of
[1:10:21] jesus amen
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:33] was
