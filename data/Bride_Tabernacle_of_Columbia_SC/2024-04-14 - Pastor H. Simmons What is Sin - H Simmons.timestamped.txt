[32:13] brokenhearted in Jesus Christ's name we
[32:15] thank you as we look to you to bless
[32:17] your word this morning in Jesus name
[32:23] amen Romans thirr chapter we thank God
[32:29] it was just so much
[32:31] coming as reading the message the
[32:33] unpardonable sin and U it was just so
[32:37] much in that you know it talks
[32:40] about Divine love uh perfect love
[32:46] amen so Romans
[32:52] 3 and
[32:54] 23 it says for all have sin
[32:58] sin and come short of the glory of
[33:03] God that you read the next and we read
[33:06] the last verse
[33:10] together
[33:13] redist whom God has set forth to be a
[33:18] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[33:22] to declare his righteousness for the
[33:25] remission of sin that pass through the
[33:29] forany of God 26 to declare I
[33:42] say where is boasting then it is
[33:47] excluded by what law or work nay but by
[33:53] the law of Faith 8 28 therefore conclude
[33:58] that a man
[34:00] isied withouts of
[34:04] the
[34:06] is
[34:08] he the god of the Jews
[34:11] only is he not also of the Gentiles yes
[34:16] of the Gentiles also
[34:18] 30
[34:21] is
[34:25] ccum together do we then make Lord the
[34:30] law through faith God forbid y we
[34:34] establish the law God bless you to read
[34:36] this word you may be
[34:37] seated God is good amen
[34:41] amen you know I I what is
[34:45] sin and um often times we see a lot of
[34:50] um different definitions of sin but we
[34:55] understand
[34:56] that when we think about Sin we think
[34:59] about the transgressions of God's
[35:02] law and
[35:04] um what is sin he says here in the 23rd
[35:09] verse for all have what s all have sin
[35:14] all have sinned and come short of the
[35:16] glory of God sometimes this scripture is
[35:19] often times used for an excuse for
[35:22] people to
[35:24] sin and so they said is Nobody's Perfect
[35:27] and all have sined and come short of the
[35:30] glory of God so sometimes people use it
[35:35] for an
[35:37] excuse that we can sin because all that
[35:41] sin and come short I told those young
[35:44] people don't get up when I'm preaching
[35:47] they do it every
[35:51] time all have sinned and come short of
[35:55] the glory of God
[35:58] are you with
[36:02] me what is sin sin is the transgression
[36:06] of God's law
[36:07] [Music]
[36:10] amen and we look at sin is the meaning
[36:13] transgression or overstepping the
[36:17] law it's U God has Divine
[36:22] boundaries between Good and Evil
[36:29] an iniquity is when we know what's right
[36:34] and we willfully do what's
[36:36] wrong are you with me so often times we
[36:41] look at
[36:42] sin and what sin is a lot of um let's
[36:47] look at Ezekiel again Ezekiel
[36:50] 18 Ezekiel
[36:53] 18 God is good
[36:56] amen sometimes
[36:59] we it's something about you know I I was
[37:02] sharing with the Sunday school this
[37:04] morning the one thing you want to do
[37:06] when you when you worship God you want
[37:08] to show God reverence you want to show
[37:10] God respect you want to show God that
[37:13] he's worthy of Our
[37:16] Praise he's worthy of Praise we want God
[37:20] to get Glory when we come to worship God
[37:24] we want our worship to be acceptable
[37:28] see because it's in man to worship God
[37:31] but whether or not we do it you know
[37:34] with our from the heart or whether we do
[37:37] it halfhazard
[37:39] and then when we worship God we must
[37:43] know what God is requiring and what God
[37:45] want because we can't give God
[37:48] anything just anything God this is what
[37:51] I'm going to give you that was the
[37:54] attitude in the beginning with Cain and
[37:56] AA
[37:58] well what is sin is transgression of
[38:00] God's law God said in the
[38:05] beginning he said in the beginning he
[38:07] says you can eat of every tree of the
[38:09] garden but of the tree of knowledge and
[38:11] good and evil that the day you eat
[38:12] thereof you're going to die don't touch
[38:15] it don't eat it or you're going to die
[38:18] that's simple you can eat everything
[38:19] else but don't do that when the sin
[38:22] began sin began in
[38:25] heaven when Lucifer said in is hard you
[38:29] know I will exalt my throne above the
[38:31] stars of God so he got exalted and
[38:34] lifted up in other words he said I'm
[38:36] taking
[38:37] over I'm taking over I'm not satisfied
[38:41] with what God made me and where God has
[38:44] made me and the position God has made me
[38:47] so I'm going to take over I'm going to
[38:49] set my
[38:51] throne and he convinced the third of the
[38:54] angels that hey
[38:58] if y when I get promoted I'm going to
[39:00] promote y'all I'm going to lift y'all up
[39:03] are you with me so we all going to be
[39:06] exalted amen and see sometimes people uh
[39:13] the pride get in the way he got lifted
[39:16] up in his heart are you with me so a lot
[39:19] of times when people get lifted up they
[39:22] expect for everybody amen look at how
[39:26] beautiful I am look at what God made me
[39:29] and I I supposed to
[39:32] be you know like
[39:35] God you understand so he saw in his
[39:41] until he was lifted
[39:42] up instead of being humble and thanking
[39:45] God for what he made us and how he made
[39:48] us people get lifted
[39:50] up and that's the attitude of man we
[39:53] were born with the sinful nature a
[39:55] nature that doesn't uh don't want to
[39:58] give God
[39:59] glory a nature that is
[40:03] corrupt it's a it's a sinful nature
[40:06] because of what Adam and Eve did it was
[40:08] passed down to everybody that was born
[40:11] of a
[40:14] woman now
[40:16] Jesus was not
[40:18] born by sex
[40:21] desire so Jesus was
[40:25] born the spirit over shad
[40:27] are you with me so he wasn't born a
[40:31] sinner are you with
[40:33] me so
[40:36] uh
[40:37] maybe I go hold you Ezekiel and go to uh
[40:42] Psalms
[40:45] 51 Psalms 51 Jesus was not born a
[40:50] sinner you know somebody say Jesus is
[40:52] born like everybody else I said no no no
[40:54] no I don't know who asked me that the
[40:56] other day I said no no I think uh
[41:00] gentleman asked me that I said no Jesus
[41:03] was not born in sin like all of us was
[41:06] born in sin but not
[41:09] Jesus are you with
[41:11] me
[41:13] Jesus was born of
[41:17] God are you with me Mary was not his
[41:23] mother as being
[41:28] she was an
[41:30] incubator she was like an
[41:33] incubator God used the
[41:37] body as to bring forth Jesus Christ but
[41:42] G it was not her egg neither was it
[41:44] Joseph's sperm are you with
[41:47] me but the spirit of God created egg and
[41:53] sperm and so if it wasn't her blood it
[41:57] wasn't his blood uh U Joseph blood but
[42:00] it was the blood of
[42:02] God Amen so what happens he was not born
[42:08] with a sinful
[42:10] nature he had a nature of God are you
[42:14] with
[42:16] me but the Bible says he was tempted in
[42:23] all like passion such as we
[42:27] he could feel pain he could feel sorrow
[42:30] he could feel rejection he could feel it
[42:34] all he wept that latter's
[42:37] grave he could feel sorrow he could feel
[42:40] everything he's God that's touched by
[42:43] the feeling of our what our
[42:46] infirmities he wanted to see what it's
[42:49] like and what you and I was going
[42:52] through being God he could not feel that
[42:57] but being a man he could feel what you
[43:00] go
[43:00] through he can understand like
[43:05] passions and and he can sympathize with
[43:09] you and understand what you
[43:11] feel he can understand disappointment he
[43:14] can understand rejection he can
[43:17] understand what it's like to be
[43:21] hated he can understand all of that
[43:25] being God he was a spirit
[43:27] but being the
[43:31] man he had to feel what you
[43:36] feel and understand but he could do it
[43:40] and not
[43:43] sin he could do it and not
[43:46] sin you know we can only take with so
[43:50] much and sometimes we get
[43:53] [Music]
[43:54] to we get to uh why is this happening to
[43:58] me or why did so and so do me like that
[44:02] why did they say that to me and we can
[44:05] start hurting and
[44:08] understand I ain't going to take that
[44:11] but Jesus took
[44:13] it he went through it for you and
[44:17] I the Bible says he didn't sin neither
[44:20] was God found in his
[44:22] mouth how many times we say huh they
[44:26] don't know who they messing with you
[44:29] messing with the wrong person when you
[44:30] mess with me because you don't know who
[44:34] I
[44:35] am Jesus knew who he was yet he humbled
[44:42] himself they asked him are you the are
[44:45] you the king of the
[44:47] Jews what say you of
[44:50] yourself you know Jesus statement knew
[44:54] who he was yet he let he allow them to
[44:59] do to
[45:01] him the things that they
[45:03] done but I wonder will we allow
[45:08] it will we allow ourselves to go through
[45:12] what he went through I said in Sunday
[45:14] school he was
[45:16] crucified in
[45:20] weakness but he rose in
[45:25] power are you with me he rose in
[45:31] power amen you and I like we are
[45:34] crucified every day we bearing our Mark
[45:39] our bodies the mark of the Lord Jesus
[45:41] Christ he we he he said I'm crucified
[45:44] with Christ Paul says nevertheless I
[45:47] live but yet it's not me that's living
[45:49] it's Christ that Liv in
[45:52] me are you with me
[45:55] amen and because because of his
[45:58] resurrection power we can die to
[46:01] ourselves daily amen are you with me
[46:05] because greater is he
[46:08] that's in you than he that
[46:11] is

[50:19] multitude of thy tender Mercy blot out
[50:23] my what Wash Me thoroughly from my
[50:28] iniquities and cleans me from my for I
[50:32] acknowledge my
[50:34] what you know it's something
[50:37] about if you want the Holy Ghost I I
[50:40] just listen to God's servant and he said
[50:43] you want the Holy Ghost he said if you
[50:47] uh
[50:48] confess if you really confess and
[50:51] believe with all your heart and ask God
[50:54] to forgive you and to come into your
[50:55] life he said is then you bound to get
[50:59] the Holy Ghost if you do it right from
[51:02] the heart you can hold God to his word
[51:05] and say God Amen you promise I believe
[51:08] with all my heart amen amen now you say
[51:11] you believe with all your heart but if
[51:14] you really believe with all your heart
[51:16] that entitles you to the Holy Ghost if
[51:18] you accept Jesus Christ with all your
[51:21] heart and you said God I believe with
[51:23] all my heart Jesus that you died for my
[51:26] sin and I accept you as my savior then
[51:29] it entites you say Lord I now fill me
[51:31] with your spirit Lord amen fill me with
[51:33] the Holy
[51:37] Ghost how many believe Jesus died for
[51:39] your sin I believe but with all your
[51:42] heart with all your
[51:45] heart
[51:48] now and when you believe with all your
[51:50] heart you should say God I believe with
[51:53] all my heart everything within me I
[51:56] believe with all my
[51:58] heart then I
[52:00] should so Lord you promised me the Holy
[52:04] Ghost so I can hold God to his word amen
[52:08] and you know I I believe if you believe
[52:10] with all your heart that you can walk
[52:12] out of here this morning filled with the
[52:14] Holy Ghost amen but you got to believe
[52:16] with all your heart amen not believe
[52:19] with all your
[52:20] head and all your intelligence but with
[52:24] all your heart amen when you believe
[52:27] like that that means you surrender all
[52:28] to
[52:29] him that means that you saying God
[52:32] whatever your will is for my life I want
[52:34] it amen amen not my will but yours Lord
[52:38] I believe with all my heart amen amen
[52:41] Lord I give you my all am everything I
[52:44] got amen Lord i s all amen the reason
[52:49] why people don't receive the Holy Ghost
[52:51] like they used to it's because people
[52:54] don't want to give up
[52:57] it it ain't no new way of receiving the
[52:59] Holy Ghost it ain't no new it ain't that
[53:02] God don't want to give you the Holy
[53:03] Ghost the Holy Ghost is already here
[53:06] waiting on you to just receive
[53:10] it but it's up to you whether or not you
[53:13] want it or
[53:16] not because Jesus Christ is Savior and
[53:19] he's
[53:20] Lord okay I got to
[53:23] get David was acknowledging his
[53:26] transgression and his sin as ever
[53:29] before against thee and the only have I
[53:33] sinned and done this evil in thy sight
[53:38] David had done a wicked thing that thou
[53:41] may be justified when thou speakest and
[53:45] be clear when thou judge and then this
[53:48] is what I wanted to get to behold I was
[53:52] what and I was what
[53:57] see we was born a
[53:59] sinner did we have anything to do with
[54:02] it
[54:05] no we were born a sinner and we didn't
[54:08] have anything to do
[54:10] with how mean we
[54:13] are how bad we
[54:16] are we ain't had nothing to do with it
[54:19] but if you like
[54:21] it you born of sin but you like being
[54:25] who you are how you would Bor I can't
[54:27] help I was bone no you can't help it cuz
[54:29] you was born like
[54:31] that you was born to sinner but do you
[54:34] like
[54:35] it you look in the mirror I like it I'm
[54:39] this I'm
[54:40] that you
[54:42] know we ain't talking about looking in
[54:45] the mirror at your physical
[54:47] makeup but if your spiritual
[54:51] makeup what you are in the
[54:54] inside do you love who you
[54:58] are your
[55:01] character do you want to be like you
[55:05] are if you want it then you can keep
[55:10] it but if you willing to give it up for
[55:13] a
[55:15] better are you with me if you want to
[55:19] give it up for
[55:21] better then God got something better for
[55:24] you amen amen a better nature
[55:29] amen you know us Simmons are like this
[55:32] and us this is like that and yeah don't
[55:36] brag on that cuz us all us
[55:40] sin we all have
[55:43] sin and come short of the glory of God
[55:47] so it's not us this and us that all have
[55:51] sined we ain't got nothing to boast or
[55:53] brag about am we all came forth in sin
[55:58] shaping and iniquity nobody got nothing
[56:01] on the
[56:03] other don't care how smart you are how
[56:05] intelligent you
[56:08] are
[56:10] sin
[56:12] has
[56:14] it's judgment a
[56:17] punishment for being the sinner you will
[56:20] be
[56:21] punished huh I didn't do
[56:24] it I was just Bor this way why you going
[56:27] to make me pay for something I ain't had
[56:30] nothing to do
[56:31] with when you look at God he's
[56:34] unjust but here's here's the thing God
[56:39] is not going to let you pay for
[56:41] something you ain't
[56:43] done are you with
[56:47] me
[56:49] let's I Ezekiel let's just go back to
[56:53] Roman Romans 3
[57:05] and
[57:10] 24 it
[57:12] says being justified freely by his
[57:18] grace through
[57:24] what see
[57:29] Redemption means that to be delivered by
[57:33] paying the
[57:37] price Redemption means
[57:41] being
[57:43] delivered by paying the
[57:46] price
[57:48] see you didn't have nothing to do with
[57:51] being born that way and you can't do
[57:54] nothing to get yourself out of that
[57:58] state but I want you to know that the
[58:00] price has been
[58:02] paid the pen the Bible tells us in
[58:05] Romans 6 and 23 for the wages of sin is
[58:11] is death but
[58:13] the God wants to give you a
[58:16] gift to take care of
[58:20] what the price that you could not pay He
[58:24] Paid a Debt he did not owe
[58:27] amen are you with me Christ Jesus Paid a
[58:33] Debt amen and I'm glad that he paid the
[58:38] price that you and I might not be
[58:42] trapped in a sinful
[58:44] body we might not have to go to hell and
[58:47] pay a
[58:49] price because of what somebody else
[58:53] done from Adam
[58:57] praise
[58:59] God in Adam the Bible says all died but
[59:03] in Christ all should be made
[59:06] alive are you with me so I'm saying to
[59:10] you that amen the debt has been paid
[59:13] amen amen praise God it's up to you to
[59:17] receive the gift amen of eternal life
[59:22] for God so loved the world am that he
[59:25] gave believe his only begotten son that
[59:30] whosoever believe in him do you
[59:37] believe you know I I I put down
[59:40] something sin is not
[59:44] believing somebody said I can't see that
[59:48] but seeing is not
[59:50] believing he told uh Thomas blessed is
[59:53] he that have not seen but yet yet they
[59:56] believe amen
[1:00:00] amen see we are justified by faith and
[1:00:03] we have peace with God through our Lord
[1:00:05] Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ therefore being justified by
[1:00:10] faith faith is not what you
[1:00:13] see it's what you
[1:00:16] believe amen and if faith is what you
[1:00:20] believe then the faith is the substance
[1:00:23] of things hope for and it's the evid
[1:00:29] see amen I don't have to see to believe
[1:00:33] it praise God I believe it though I've
[1:00:36] not seen it yet I believe amen are you
[1:00:40] with me and I receive the
[1:00:45] results amen because I am a believer am
[1:00:50] it entitles me amen amen oh hallelujah

[1:00:58] them that believe Amen in my name they
[1:01:01] shall cast out Devils amen oh yes amen
[1:01:06] when you a Believer the devil is in
[1:01:09] trouble amen amen because God give you
[1:01:12] Victory and it gives you power amen amen
[1:01:16] sin should not have dominion over you
[1:01:19] anymore amen praise God you don't have
[1:01:22] to worry about Sin anymore you don't
[1:01:25] have to worry worry about that old
[1:01:27] sinful nature anymore God has handled it
[1:01:30] am he took away our sins and he gave us
[1:01:34] his
[1:01:35] righteousness amen praise God he been he
[1:01:38] was made sin for us that we might be
[1:01:40] made the righteousness of God in him
[1:01:43] amen thank God that I'm no longer a
[1:01:46] sinner amen amen praise God but he calls
[1:01:48] me a saint amen you you you you children
[1:01:52] of the God Amen praise God IJ you were
[1:01:56] once by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:01:59] amen but now amen no more amen I no more
[1:02:04] a child of Wrath amen come on somebody
[1:02:08] Shake somebody hand tell them the apple
[1:02:10] is not the
[1:02:20] tree the apple is not the
[1:02:23] tree but the apple is the fruit
[1:02:26] that comes from the
[1:02:28] tree but the apple is not the tree are
[1:02:32] you with me see the attributes of
[1:02:36] sin when folks said I I still drink I
[1:02:40] still smoke
[1:02:42] I I still fornicate I still commit a
[1:02:45] Doctrine I still do this
[1:02:48] amen those things are
[1:02:50] not sin as we see but there are
[1:02:55] attributes
[1:02:59] the Bible say you shall know them by
[1:03:02] their fruit so what kind of tree is an
[1:03:06] apple tree why because this isn't an
[1:03:11] apple a sinner is known
[1:03:16] by are you with me the life you live on
[1:03:20] the job in the school it doesn't matter
[1:03:23] what church you go to it does doesn't
[1:03:26] matter what you say you are it doesn't
[1:03:28] matter because your actions
[1:03:31] speak your life
[1:03:35] is the life you live is
[1:03:38] saying whether or not
[1:03:41] you a Believer or
[1:03:47] not come on
[1:03:49] somebody how you amen conduct your life
[1:03:54] how you look how you act how you conduct
[1:03:57] life tells
[1:04:00] me some folk you can just look at in the
[1:04:03] market place and you said that's a
[1:04:06] Christian that young man something about
[1:04:08] that young man something about that
[1:04:10] young
[1:04:11] lady she must be a
[1:04:15] Christian but some folk you look at them
[1:04:18] and the way they carry themselves you
[1:04:21] will never say Christian
[1:04:26] you never think
[1:04:28] Christian are you with me in their
[1:04:32] conversation you never think
[1:04:35] Christian because there's no Christ in
[1:04:39] their con
[1:04:41] conversation are you with
[1:04:43] me so we want
[1:04:46] Amen to understand what Sin is Sin is to
[1:04:51] reject
[1:04:56] God's
[1:04:57] word are you with me when you reject the
[1:05:02] word of God it's the door is
[1:05:06] open for
[1:05:10] sin when you misstep and you step over
[1:05:14] the boundary like Eve did she stepped
[1:05:19] over and she did what she knew she
[1:05:22] wasn't supposed to do because she dis
[1:05:25] believe what God Said Amen see we
[1:05:30] wouldn't have never had to feel pain
[1:05:33] never have to feel sorrow never have to
[1:05:36] be disappointed if Eve wouldn't have
[1:05:38] done what she done and Adam
[1:05:42] followed are you with
[1:05:46] me you would never have to have some of
[1:05:50] the problems and difficulties and the
[1:05:52] things you go through you would never
[1:05:54] have to go through do those
[1:05:58] things if you only eat of the tree of
[1:06:01] life and live
[1:06:03] forever are you with me somebody say
[1:06:07] well I see Christians they go through
[1:06:09] things are you with
