[18:48] well praise the lord everybody
[18:50] hallelujah
[18:52] amen
[18:57] i'd like just to
[18:59] read the passage of scripture that's
[19:00] gonna be my remark
[19:02] in ecclesiastics
[19:04] the second chapter the 22nd chapter the
[19:06] first verse
[19:08] it reads thusly
[19:10] a good name
[19:12] is rather to be chosen
[19:15] than great riches
[19:18] and loving favor
[19:20] rather than silver
[19:22] or gold
[19:24] hallelujah
[19:26] this young man
[19:28] had a good name
[19:31] and uh personally
[19:33] he helped me so many times with my
[19:35] television show and
[19:37] all kinds of things it says whenever you
[19:39] need help
[19:42] young daniel was there he had a good
[19:44] name
[19:46] but when i think about what this
[19:48] scripture says about having a good name
[19:51] you know the only way we can have a good
[19:53] name is that we got to do good
[19:56] amen
[19:58] and the only thing that make us do good
[20:00] the only good thing in us is the holy
[20:02] ghost
[20:03] and that good name that make us do good
[20:05] that name is jesus
[20:08] and so every time
[20:09] when i see the things that was done over
[20:12] the years
[20:13] all i could see is that good name
[20:17] see there's power in that good name it's
[20:20] healing in that good name
[20:22] it's deliverance in that good name
[20:25] that good name is a living epistle for
[20:27] us
[20:29] hallelujah
[20:30] and i thank god for this good name
[20:33] that was spoken of
[20:36] over the years
[20:37] i just want to bless god and bless the
[20:39] family
[20:41] for a good name
[20:43] through your son daniel hallelujah amen

[43:19] if you have your bibles you can turn to
[43:23] matthew chapter 19.
[43:26] verse 16 through verse
[43:28] 22.
[43:33] matthew chapter 19
[43:34] [Music]
[43:35] verses 16 through verse
[43:38] 22.
[43:41] and behold
[43:43] one came i said unto him
[43:46] good master
[43:48] what good thing
[43:50] shall i do
[43:52] that may have eternal life
[43:55] and they said unto him
[43:58] while because thou mean good
[44:01] there's only one good and that is god
[44:04] amen
[44:06] but if you want to have
[44:08] eternal life
[44:10] keep his commandments
[44:13] and he said unto him
[44:15] which
[44:16] and jesus said thou shalt do
[44:19] no murder
[44:20] thou shalt not commit adultery
[44:23] thou shalt not steal
[44:25] thou shalt not be a false witness
[44:28] honor thy father and thy mother
[44:31] and thou shall have and love thy
[44:32] neighbor as thyself a young man said
[44:34] unto him
[44:35] yeah i've done this all my life
[44:38] since i was a youth
[44:40] what else do i like
[44:43] and jesus said unto him
[44:45] if i would be perfect
[44:47] go and sell
[44:49] that with our house
[44:51] and give to the poor
[44:54] and thou
[44:55] shalt have
[44:56] treasure
[44:58] in heaven
[45:00] and come
[45:01] and follow me
[45:03] give away all your money
[45:06] all your riches
[45:08] and then come follow me
[45:11] but when the young man heard that sin
[45:15] he went away sorrowfully
[45:18] for he had great possessions
[45:21] he had a lot of wealth
[45:24] and now he's been asked
[45:26] if you want to have eternal life
[45:28] you've got to
[45:30] give it away
[45:32] and come follow me
[45:36] what have you given away
[45:39] for following christ to follow him
[45:43] amen
[45:46] a subject today
[45:49] in the form of a question
[45:52] where would you spend eternity
[45:57] where would you spend
[45:59] eternity
[46:02] do you need a minute to think about it
[46:06] have you ever thought about it
[46:09] where would you spend
[46:10] eternity
[46:12] amen
[46:14] we just read this young man
[46:17] want to know who
[46:19] and what he must do
[46:21] to have eternal life
[46:24] amen
[46:26] eternal life is always linked to one or
[46:29] two things
[46:31] heaven or hell
[46:34] amen
[46:36] and this is the question every one of us
[46:39] know the answer
[46:40] to you sit here today
[46:44] you know if you die today
[46:46] you know whether or not you go to heaven
[46:48] or hell
[46:50] amen
[46:53] and one thing i say to people often
[46:56] don't fool your own self
[46:59] amen
[47:01] this is a thought-provoking question
[47:04] that we all have the answers to
[47:06] amen
[47:07] and jesus while
[47:09] on earth
[47:11] told the disciples and the pastors
[47:15] and he gave unto them
[47:17] amen this promise
[47:19] amen in john 14 1-9
[47:23] i go to prepare a place for you
[47:26] i will come again to receive unto myself
[47:30] you know when the story went on and
[47:32] jesus explained to them
[47:34] amen that he was going to get a place
[47:36] ready
[47:38] we commonly call that place heaven
[47:40] amen where we all want to spend eternity
[47:44] and jesus said i'm going to prepare that
[47:46] place for you and i'm going to come back
[47:49] see nobody's going to heaven amen
[47:53] you're going to be taken to heaven
[47:54] that's the only way you're going to get
[47:55] there
[47:56] and jesus said i'm going to come again
[47:58] and i'm going to receive unto myself
[48:01] that where i am there you may be also
[48:04] and the way you should know
[48:06] the sabbath i say well lord we don't
[48:08] know the way
[48:09] amen tell us what is the way
[48:12] and jesus said i am the way
[48:15] i'm the truth
[48:16] and i'm the life
[48:18] no man come to the father
[48:21] but by me
[48:23] then
[48:24] another disciple asked him well lord you
[48:26] know
[48:27] you talk about the father
[48:29] you know show us the father
[48:32] and we'll be satisfied
[48:35] and jesus has i've been this long time
[48:37] with you
[48:38] and yet thou have not known me
[48:41] amen when you see me
[48:44] you see the father
[48:46] so why ask me to
[48:48] show you the father you're looking at
[48:50] him
[48:51] and this is a problem that trinitarians
[48:53] have
[48:55] understanding
[48:57] that jesus is god
[48:59] amen
[49:01] he's the father in creation the son the
[49:02] redemption and the holy ghost in the
[49:04] church and in the believers
[49:06] but still it is one god
[49:08] amen
[49:09] if the day
[49:11] was the day of the rapture
[49:14] are you ready
[49:17] if the ratchet will take place at this
[49:19] very moment
[49:22] are you ready
[49:24] and i i'm assuming that most of us
[49:26] understand and know what the word
[49:28] rapture means what we're talking about
[49:30] the rapture
[49:31] that's when the lord come back for the
[49:33] church for his bride
[49:34] amen and take us back with him that's
[49:36] how we come back amen when the dead in
[49:38] christ will get out of the grave and all
[49:40] of us together will go to meet him in
[49:41] the air
[49:43] if that was today
[49:45] are you ready for the rapture at this
[49:47] very moment
[49:49] is there anything you need to go and get
[49:50] straightened out
[49:52] anything you need to go and undo
[49:55] that you can make the rapture
[49:57] amen
[49:59] the question still is and i'll get to
[50:01] that shortly
[50:03] where will you spend
[50:05] eternity
[50:07] and jesus gave us
[50:08] plenty of time to get ready
[50:11] if you got saved yesterday
[50:14] it might and the right to come today you
[50:15] had enough time to be prepared
[50:18] amen
[50:19] what are we using
[50:21] the time that he has given you
[50:24] how are you using that time
[50:27] amen
[50:29] it's something that people waste
[50:32] but nothing as much as they waste time
[50:36] putting off
[50:38] procrastinating making promises to
[50:41] themself
[50:43] that they don't keep
[50:45] amen
[50:46] promising i'm going to do better
[50:49] i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[50:50] that
[50:52] and sometime in the midst of all these
[50:54] decisions one trying to make win
[50:57] i'm going to get
[50:59] these things accomplished when am i
[51:00] going to get to be a better person
[51:04] you know
[51:05] jesus gave all of us a lot of time
[51:08] to get prepared
[51:10] you mind
[51:13] how are you using the time
[51:17] that he's giving you
[51:19] amen
[51:20] how do you use your time yesterday
[51:23] those 24 hours yesterday
[51:26] how did you use it
[51:28] hey man
[51:31] if you're 25 years of age
[51:34] what have you accomplished are done in
[51:35] those 25 years
[51:37] to get prepared for the rapture
[51:41] to get prepared for the coming of the
[51:42] lord
[51:45] or
[51:46] to get prepared to die
[51:50] second kings chapter 20
[51:55] second kings
[51:57] the 20th chapter
[52:00] and i want you to consider what the word
[52:02] of god says
[52:04] here in the word of god
[52:06] in the book of second kings
[52:09] chapter 20. we all are familiar
[52:13] with hezekiah
[52:16] and i'm sure we have
[52:17] heard
[52:19] messages from this book
[52:22] you read these scriptures yourself
[52:26] so i'm going to read it to us again
[52:29] from second kings chapter 20
[52:32] verse 1 to verse 7.
[52:38] in those days
[52:41] was hezekiah sick unto death
[52:44] and the prophet isaiah the son of amos
[52:48] came to him
[52:51] and said unto him
[52:53] thus said the lord
[52:56] set your house in order
[53:00] for thou shalt die
[53:03] and not live
[53:05] then he turned his face to the wall
[53:09] and prayed unto the lord saying
[53:11] i beseech thee oh lord remember now how
[53:15] i have walked before thee in truth and
[53:18] with a perfect heart
[53:21] and have done that which is good
[53:23] in thy sight
[53:25] and hezekiah wept saw
[53:29] and they came to pass
[53:31] before isaiah was gone
[53:34] amen and to the middle coat
[53:37] that the word of the lord came to isaiah
[53:40] and said unto him turn again and tell
[53:42] hezekiah
[53:44] the captain of my people
[53:46] thus saith the lord the god of david
[53:50] thy father
[53:51] i've heard thy prayer
[53:54] have seen thy tears
[53:56] behold i will hear thee
[53:58] on the third day that thou shall go up
[54:01] to the throne of the lord and i will add
[54:03] unto thy days
[54:05] 15
[54:06] years
[54:08] amen
[54:10] 15 more years to live
[54:13] uh hezekiah
[54:18] was the king of israel
[54:21] and you're taken sick
[54:26] and the lord told a prophet
[54:29] isaiah
[54:30] go and tell hezekiah
[54:33] to get his house in order
[54:36] he didn't give him much time
[54:38] that's why we ought to stay ready
[54:40] amen because today he's going to die
[54:44] and not live
[54:47] and when hezekiah heard this
[54:49] he began to cry
[54:52] and it turned his face to the wall
[54:56] and began to talk to the lord
[54:59] lord you know how i have
[55:01] tried to walk up right before you
[55:04] i have a perfect heart
[55:07] i try to keep your word in your will
[55:11] and then he turned his face to the wall
[55:12] and began to weep and the bible said he
[55:14] wept sore
[55:16] i mean he was really crying
[55:19] because he did not want to die
[55:22] and the lord
[55:24] spoke to isaiah
[55:26] said isaiah turn around and go back
[55:30] and tell hezekiah
[55:32] i heard his prayers
[55:34] and tell him i'm going to give him 15
[55:36] more years to live
[55:39] amen
[55:41] and can you imagine what hezekiah
[55:44] must have felt
[55:46] in knowing i have 50 more years to live
[55:50] amen
[55:53] when hezekiah heard this
[55:56] and my message from isaiah
[55:58] the first message was set your house in
[56:01] order
[56:02] you're not talking about his fi his
[56:04] palace
[56:05] he's talking about his life
[56:08] be sure that you have it in order
[56:10] praise the lord
[56:12] and
[56:13] everyone does not always
[56:16] have experience like hezekiah
[56:19] amen
[56:20] to know when you're going to die
[56:23] see god told hezekiah you're going to
[56:25] die tonight
[56:27] if all of us knew today if you knew
[56:29] right now
[56:31] and you're going to die tonight
[56:34] what you have to get in order
[56:39] what would you have to change
[56:42] what would you have to do
[56:44] who do you have to go to and
[56:46] and ask forgiveness
[56:49] and what things you have to turn around
[56:51] and make am i in correction in some
[56:53] things
[56:55] because you don't have much
[56:56] time and i'm afraid that with some
[56:59] people
[57:00] and my time will run out because they
[57:01] have so much
[57:03] to sit in order
[57:05] if they knew they was going to die
[57:07] tonight
[57:09] amen
[57:10] so what about us
[57:13] if you knew tonight
[57:15] you're going to die at seven o'clock
[57:18] how would you spend the next three or
[57:20] four hours
[57:22] what would you busy doing
[57:24] amen hezekiah lived such a life
[57:27] amen the bible says he began to weep and
[57:30] he prayed to god and told the lord well
[57:32] lord you know i've tried to live a good
[57:34] life before you
[57:36] i've upheld your word and i lived
[57:38] according to your word
[57:40] amen
[57:42] and because of
[57:43] hezekiah's prayer
[57:46] and the life he had lived
[57:48] god given 15 more years but
[57:51] if today was your last day
[57:54] how much time do you think
[57:56] god will give you if any
[58:01] amen
[58:03] i've learned
[58:05] about
[58:06] preaching it should be something that is
[58:09] thought provoking
[58:12] it cause people to stop and to think
[58:15] amen
[58:17] see because once
[58:18] you're dead
[58:20] you cannot make any changes
[58:23] it's like the pecan tree in your yard
[58:25] you cut it down as a pea country when it
[58:27] hit the ground it's going to be a pecan
[58:28] tree
[58:30] next month is going to be a pecan tree
[58:32] and when i ride up it would be a rotten
[58:34] pecan tree it will not change
[58:37] death
[58:38] will not change you
[58:41] the changes must be done while we are
[58:43] living
[58:44] amen
[58:46] and god give us a lot of time
[58:49] amen we see all these gray hairs in here
[58:51] and
[58:52] 40 50 60 70 80 years of age
[58:56] then you see some teen years
[59:00] teenage years
[59:01] but what are you doing with your life
[59:05] are you preparing for eternity
[59:08] are you preparing for everlasting life
[59:11] amen
[59:12] hezekiah
[59:15] reminded god not that god had forgotten
[59:17] but out of his heart because hezekiah
[59:19] did not want to die
[59:22] and i'm sure today if the question will
[59:23] ask all of us
[59:25] you want to die today no hands will go
[59:27] up
[59:28] amen we got things we want to get done
[59:30] we have not accomplished it we want to
[59:32] further things on
[59:34] but if you knew you were saved
[59:37] and ready for death
[59:39] amen would you take that opportunity and
[59:42] say lord amen don't wait till tomorrow
[59:44] take me now amen heaven is waiting on me
[59:49] but when you're not sure
[59:52] when you have questions in your own mind
[59:55] whether or not you're really saved
[59:58] i've been baptized in jesus name i have
[1:00:00] the holy ghost
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:05] and you say you're saved
[1:00:08] there are many
[1:00:10] sinners
[1:00:11] who were baptized in jesus name and
[1:00:13] filled with the holy ghost many
[1:00:14] backsliders
[1:00:16] and many liars been baptized in jesus
[1:00:18] name and filled with the holy ghost all
[1:00:20] the thieves
[1:00:21] have been baptized in water in the name
[1:00:23] of jesus christ
[1:00:25] but it's the quality of life that you
[1:00:27] live
[1:00:28] with the time that god gives to you
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:32] that gives you that opportunity to have
[1:00:34] eternal life
[1:00:36] but hezekiah
[1:00:38] in his prayer to god
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:41] and god does not have to be reminded but
[1:00:43] hezekiah was consoling himself
[1:00:46] you know i tried to live a good life i
[1:00:48] walked up right before you
[1:00:50] i've done right toward others i lived a
[1:00:53] good life
[1:00:54] amen and because of hezekiah's tears
[1:00:59] god sent him
[1:01:01] through isaiah 50 more years to live
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] but then if you read the rest of the
[1:01:07] story
[1:01:09] what did hezekiah do in those other 15
[1:01:11] years
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:14] read the rest of the book
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:18] hezekiah
[1:01:19] recovered from the sickness
[1:01:22] rose up
[1:01:24] had visited to come to visit him
[1:01:27] they heard what had happened to him and
[1:01:28] how he now had been healed and delivered
[1:01:31] amen and he went into the house of god
[1:01:34] in a place where they shouldn't have
[1:01:35] gone and showed them everything that was
[1:01:37] in there
[1:01:39] you mind
[1:01:41] sometimes in life
[1:01:44] we waste a lot of time
[1:01:47] some people spend more time looking for
[1:01:49] a job a better job
[1:01:52] than seeking more righteousness
[1:01:55] with god
[1:01:57] spent more time doing other things
[1:02:00] and not praying
[1:02:02] not fasting
[1:02:03] not walking up right before the lord so
[1:02:07] if the day was your last day
[1:02:10] how would you spend
[1:02:12] these last few hours
[1:02:15] if the rapture will come
[1:02:16] at any moment and it just
[1:02:18] might the rapture may come before the
[1:02:21] service is over
[1:02:23] if so
[1:02:25] are you ready for the rapture
[1:02:28] there's a saying
[1:02:31] that they use out in california a church
[1:02:33] where i started out there
[1:02:35] it was that you've got to be
[1:02:38] rapture ready
[1:02:39] or graveyard ready
[1:02:42] one of the others are going to come
[1:02:43] before one
[1:02:45] if you're rapture ready
[1:02:47] the grave don't hold no terror for the
[1:02:49] bloodborne one
[1:02:51] those who walk out right before god
[1:02:54] but what are you doing with your life
[1:02:55] now
[1:02:57] amen i go through a list of
[1:03:01] thing that we should be doing and have
[1:03:02] done
[1:03:05] can we all say to those things
[1:03:07] well lord i love all my brothers and
[1:03:10] sisters
[1:03:12] lord
[1:03:13] i don't line
[1:03:15] i don't steal
[1:03:17] lord i'm faithful in all things
[1:03:19] and we go down the list of the good
[1:03:21] things i've done
[1:03:23] but then god still says to us
[1:03:27] there may be something you're liking
[1:03:29] there is another man in the bible
[1:03:32] who experienced
[1:03:35] a decision to be made
[1:03:38] and he was prepared
[1:03:40] a man to go on living his life
[1:03:43] you know about the rich man
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:46] and all the wealth that he could spend
[1:03:50] all of the money
[1:03:52] laying houses servants
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:55] and the same rich man had a poor man
[1:03:59] lazarus
[1:04:00] who will come every day
[1:04:03] souls all over his body and sit at the
[1:04:05] gate
[1:04:07] and just hoping that someone will come
[1:04:08] out of the king's place and
[1:04:11] give him something to eat
[1:04:13] maybe the scraps left from what the dogs
[1:04:15] left behind just anything
[1:04:18] and this man pay no attention
[1:04:21] to lazarus
[1:04:23] and then the bible says
[1:04:26] the servant came and said master
[1:04:28] we got a good crop
[1:04:30] things are going well and good
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:35] you're prospering
[1:04:36] and we got to tear down some
[1:04:39] little bonds and make bigger bonds to
[1:04:41] put all that you have into it
[1:04:44] you're making so much
[1:04:46] and what a tragedy that we live in now
[1:04:49] in our time
[1:04:51] when prices going up food getting scarce
[1:04:55] problems everywhere
[1:04:57] the money that you make
[1:04:59] a few years ago a few months ago that
[1:05:01] went in my a long wait
[1:05:04] doesn't go half that far any longer
[1:05:06] and people are struggling
[1:05:08] but how many has turned into god
[1:05:12] amen but this rich man
[1:05:15] trying to tell my little bonds and big
[1:05:17] bigger bonds
[1:05:19] and i can say to my soul so take it easy
[1:05:22] you got a nade now
[1:05:24] amen rest easy
[1:05:27] and then the lord said thy fool
[1:05:30] this very night
[1:05:32] your soul
[1:05:34] is required of you you're going to die
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:39] what if god will say to you
[1:05:44] set your house in order
[1:05:46] in one hour you're going to die
[1:05:50] i'm sure
[1:05:52] this man who was rich
[1:05:55] if he could buy a ticket to heaven
[1:05:58] he was prepared
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:02] but what have we stored up
[1:06:05] to give us
[1:06:06] an opportunity
[1:06:08] to have eternal life
[1:06:12] you know
[1:06:13] life
[1:06:15] is like a dollar bill of money
[1:06:19] you can only spend it one time
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:23] you get a 20 bill you go to the store
[1:06:25] you can't spend it but one time
[1:06:28] life is the same way
[1:06:30] amen and life sometimes with some people
[1:06:35] is like
[1:06:36] going grocery shopping
[1:06:39] they invest all their money in some
[1:06:40] things
[1:06:42] and put very little in the bank
[1:06:45] but even in the bank when you write a
[1:06:46] check you can't spend it no more
[1:06:49] it's gone
[1:06:51] life is the same way
[1:06:53] what are we doing with our lives
[1:06:56] are we preparing for eternity
[1:06:59] are we walking up right before the lord
[1:07:02] are we seeking salvation
[1:07:04] are we seeking am i in a relationship
[1:07:06] with god
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:10] because once
[1:07:12] death comes you can't make any changes
[1:07:16] you must do it now
[1:07:18] you cannot make any adjustments in life
[1:07:21] we must do it now
[1:07:23] that when that time come
[1:07:25] amen and it's a sad thing
[1:07:28] uh in life
[1:07:30] and those are who experience those
[1:07:31] things so we can understand and
[1:07:33] sympathize with amen those who lose a
[1:07:36] loved one
[1:07:37] amen
[1:07:39] when you're told it might you have a
[1:07:41] sickness you cannot be cured of
[1:07:46] many people
[1:07:47] fly from
[1:07:48] state to state sometime out of the
[1:07:50] country
[1:07:52] trying to find a cure
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:56] but not spending much time
[1:07:59] and getting right with god
[1:08:01] setting that house in order
[1:08:04] so the question is
[1:08:06] where would you spend eternity
[1:08:08] if we took a poll today
[1:08:11] how many hands really go up say you know
[1:08:13] i'm going to go to heaven i want to go
[1:08:15] to heaven
[1:08:17] most hands will
[1:08:19] no one would dare to say
[1:08:20] amen i want to go to hell
[1:08:23] amen except the atheist
[1:08:26] amen but
[1:08:28] god is saying to us here today
[1:08:31] you have an opportunity
[1:08:33] and while you have that time
[1:08:36] set your house in order
[1:08:39] get right with god
[1:08:41] because you've been filled with the holy
[1:08:42] ghost and baptized in jesus name what
[1:08:45] about the condition of the heart
[1:08:48] amen what about the mind
[1:08:51] how much time you spend every day you're
[1:08:53] thinking on things
[1:08:55] that you shouldn't think on
[1:08:57] what about the eyes
[1:09:00] every day you go along and god give you
[1:09:02] 20 20 vision
[1:09:04] but how are you using that eyesight
[1:09:07] are you watching things that you should
[1:09:09] not watch
[1:09:11] are you looking at things that you
[1:09:12] should not look at
[1:09:14] what about our mouth
[1:09:16] how do we use it
[1:09:18] amen besides praising god and blessing
[1:09:21] god
[1:09:23] but when we finish blessing god and
[1:09:24] praising him
[1:09:26] how do you talk to your brother and
[1:09:28] sister or your neighbor
[1:09:30] or your friend or even your enemy
[1:09:34] making preparation
[1:09:36] for going on a trip
[1:09:38] we get things prepared we put clothes in
[1:09:40] the cleanser and get those prepared and
[1:09:42] search the internet for a good ticket a
[1:09:45] good price and
[1:09:46] make advanced hotel reservation put
[1:09:48] everything in order in place
[1:09:50] am i
[1:09:52] not thinking
[1:09:53] that i may not make this trip
[1:09:57] because god may send me an isaiah
[1:10:00] they tell me you're going to die
[1:10:03] people take living for granted
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:08] bishops elders people take living for
[1:10:10] granted
[1:10:11] we are soon
[1:10:13] i'm going to be here tomorrow
[1:10:16] and in most cases that assumption is
[1:10:18] correct
[1:10:19] but what if it's wrong
[1:10:21] amen where would you spend eternity
[1:10:25] and eternity is a long time
[1:10:28] amen that's a long time how long is
[1:10:31] eternity as long as god will live and
[1:10:33] god's going to live forever you're
[1:10:35] always with god always will be god and
[1:10:37] no beginning of days no ending of time
[1:10:40] amen but i'm going to think about the
[1:10:42] consequences
[1:10:44] of wasting time
[1:10:46] not considering investing in where i'm
[1:10:48] going to spend eternity
[1:10:50] we look and we try to find a nice
[1:10:52] neighborhood to move to we're looking
[1:10:54] short for a nice car to buy at a good
[1:10:56] price
[1:10:59] but what about my soul
[1:11:02] what about my life that i'm living
[1:11:05] am i sending it in order
[1:11:07] that when the lord should come back at
[1:11:08] any moment when i lay down at night if
[1:11:10] the raptor come at two o'clock in the
[1:11:12] morning
[1:11:13] when i'm fast asleep
[1:11:15] would you be ready
[1:11:18] in the middle of the day
[1:11:20] on a weekend
[1:11:22] when the lord will come back for his
[1:11:23] church
[1:11:24] and the believers
[1:11:26] and the rapture comes
[1:11:28] and take us all away and we go back with
[1:11:30] him
[1:11:32] are you rapture ready
[1:11:34] amen where would you spend
[1:11:36] eternity
[1:11:38] there's only one or two places brothers
[1:11:40] and sisters and friends of mine
[1:11:42] there's only one of two places
[1:11:45] the options
[1:11:46] are not many
[1:11:48] you have only one or two
[1:11:50] to choose from
[1:11:52] and yes you choose you make a choice
[1:11:55] amen you see
[1:11:57] sin
[1:11:58] is optional
[1:12:01] sin is an option
[1:12:04] you have to decide to sin
[1:12:08] you have to make up your mind to sin
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:12] let me say that again sin is optional in
[1:12:15] other words you don't have to sin
[1:12:18] amen then now the bible said let not sin
[1:12:22] reign in your mortal body don't you
[1:12:24] allow it it's an option
[1:12:26] you can do it if you want to
[1:12:29] you cannot and you don't have to do it
[1:12:30] if you don't want to
[1:12:32] god will not force us
[1:12:34] amen to live right
[1:12:36] and he will not allow satan to force us
[1:12:38] to do wrong
[1:12:40] when you choose to sin it's a choice
[1:12:43] that you make
[1:12:44] amen every lie that you tell
[1:12:47] you chose you made a decision to lie
[1:12:50] you decided to lie about something
[1:12:54] to steal
[1:12:55] you made a choice a decision to steal
[1:12:57] something
[1:12:58] to backbite you made a choice
[1:13:01] so in life we have many choices to make
[1:13:05] what has been your choice
[1:13:08] as you lived
[1:13:10] have you chosen
[1:13:11] a life of holiness
[1:13:14] righteousness
[1:13:16] godliness sanctification
[1:13:19] a life of pleasure
[1:13:21] until i get too old to party
[1:13:24] and then
[1:13:25] i get right
[1:13:27] see that's a choice and god give you a
[1:13:29] right
[1:13:30] to make that choice
[1:13:32] god give you the right to choose to
[1:13:34] serve him or not you don't have to
[1:13:36] god will not force us
[1:13:38] to serve him
[1:13:40] god will not force you
[1:13:42] to fast to pray he will not force you to
[1:13:44] get baptized in jesus name
[1:13:47] he will not force you
[1:13:48] to yield your life to him to receive the
[1:13:50] gift of the holy ghost it's your choice
[1:13:53] your decision
[1:13:55] and i've learned
[1:13:56] through my years in the ministry and
[1:13:58] before being a minister before being a
[1:14:00] preacher
[1:14:01] i was taught and learned a long time ago
[1:14:04] you make your own choices and decisions
[1:14:07] the devil cannot make you
[1:14:08] he can tempt you
[1:14:10] but he cannot make you
[1:14:12] amen he can entice you
[1:14:14] he cannot force you to do wrong
[1:14:16] amen
[1:14:18] when a person goes
[1:14:20] uh through life
[1:14:22] amen choices have to be made
[1:14:25] and jesus christ set before us he said i
[1:14:27] give you a choice i'll sit before you
[1:14:29] life and death
[1:14:31] now you choose which one you want
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:35] what has been your choice
[1:14:38] am i
[1:14:40] what has been your choice
[1:14:42] to serve him
[1:14:43] to give your life to him
[1:14:45] or to wait a little longer
[1:14:48] and come back another time
[1:14:51] am i make my choice a decision
[1:14:53] you know i don't have time
[1:14:55] for all that church stuff
[1:14:57] amen they want me to come to church
[1:14:59] three or four times a week you know you
[1:15:01] know i got to get up early in the
[1:15:03] morning and go to work
[1:15:05] and the very same night
[1:15:09] death comes
[1:15:11] don't get a chance to go back to that
[1:15:12] good job the next day
[1:15:15] but how did you spend the day before
[1:15:18] what decisions you make before that time
[1:15:21] brothers and sisters today is a day
[1:15:26] of making decisions
[1:15:28] to follow christ
[1:15:30] and stay with him
[1:15:33] and
[1:15:35] and i feel something here
[1:15:38] there are some of you

[1:15:43] but you in between
[1:15:46] trying to decide decide
[1:15:49] to stay

[1:16:01] you're someone
[1:16:03] someone's
[1:16:05] you're in the valley of decision
[1:16:07] trying to decide
[1:16:10] whether i want to stay
[1:16:12] in church
[1:16:14] i'll do something else
[1:16:17] i won't do i want to stay in the church
[1:16:20] where i am a member
[1:16:22] i want to go looking for
[1:16:24] someplace else to go
[1:16:27] and all the time
[1:16:29] the hand clock is turning
[1:16:32] and death is still on its way
[1:16:36] amen
[1:16:38] make the right decision
[1:16:41] make the right choice
[1:16:43] uh i don't apologize for deviating from
[1:16:46] the end
[1:16:49] i choose rather to
[1:16:51] follow the spirit of god
[1:16:53] when god speaks to me
[1:16:56] and i know for sure as i stand here
[1:16:58] before you today
[1:17:00] someone is in the valley of indecision
[1:17:05] have not made that decision
[1:17:07] that we should make
[1:17:10] and that's a walk with christ
[1:17:12] until the end
[1:17:14] back to the closing of this message on
[1:17:16] this afternoon
[1:17:17] amen
[1:17:19] sometimes
[1:17:20] amen we live a life
[1:17:23] amen and when we get saved and you know
[1:17:25] how happy you was when you first got
[1:17:27] saved and you were sincere and you know
[1:17:29] god led you to the truth and then
[1:17:31] somebody witnessed to you someone
[1:17:33] brought you to the church and you heard
[1:17:34] the gospel preached you heard about
[1:17:36] water baptism in the name of jesus
[1:17:38] christ being the only baptism that saves
[1:17:40] you heard about the gift of the holy
[1:17:42] ghost that god promised to fill every
[1:17:43] believer with where you'll speak in
[1:17:45] tongues and be filled with the holy
[1:17:46] ghost it may have the power of god
[1:17:48] living in you to live a righteous and
[1:17:50] godly life
[1:17:51] amen you made that choice in that
[1:17:53] decision you went to the water you got
[1:17:54] baptized in water in the name of jesus
[1:17:56] christ filled with the gift for the holy
[1:17:58] ghost
[1:17:59] amen and he was on fire for the lord
[1:18:02] amen but saving is always there
[1:18:05] he's watching and waiting an opportunity
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:10] he's trying to decide
[1:18:12] amen where he can trip you up
[1:18:16] so that leaving back to my message
[1:18:17] subject
[1:18:19] where would you spend eternity
[1:18:22] on one hand
[1:18:23] christ has offered you
[1:18:25] eternal life
[1:18:27] on the other hand satan
[1:18:29] is scheming and do all that he can
[1:18:32] to cause you to turn
[1:18:34] away from that salvation that god had
[1:18:36] given to you
[1:18:38] and to turn back to a life of sin
[1:18:41] because as you go on in life
[1:18:43] if you live to be 95 or 105
[1:18:47] death will eventually come
[1:18:50] and when death comes
[1:18:52] you need to be ready
[1:18:54] there's only one way to be ready
[1:18:57] be with god walking with him
[1:18:59] staying with him
[1:19:01] amen
[1:19:02] the question is where would you spend
[1:19:04] eternity
[1:19:06] if the day was your last day
[1:19:09] where would you spend eternity if you
[1:19:11] died today
[1:19:14] where would you spend eternity
[1:19:17] and you know
[1:19:18] each one of us know
[1:19:21] if we be honest with ourselves
[1:19:24] you know at this very moment
[1:19:26] if you die today
[1:19:28] you know whether or not
[1:19:30] you go to hell
[1:19:32] or to heaven
[1:19:35] amen
[1:19:36] we know right now
[1:19:38] whether or not you're ready for the
[1:19:39] rapture or not
[1:19:42] why procrastinate
[1:19:45] set your house in order
[1:19:47] because after the death
[1:19:49] you cannot make any changes
[1:19:52] live that life
[1:19:54] while you live
[1:19:56] give your life to christ
[1:19:59] and leave it with him
[1:20:01] so when the rapture come no matter when
[1:20:03] it comes or when death comes no matter
[1:20:05] how it comes and when it comes you'll be
[1:20:07] ready to go back with the lord
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:12] don't live 60 70 80 years of age
[1:20:15] amen and die and go to hell
[1:20:20] don't live 15 years or 20 years
[1:20:23] and die
[1:20:24] and miss the rapture
[1:20:27] god give us an opportunity
[1:20:30] to choose
[1:20:32] he said i set before you life and death
[1:20:35] you choose
[1:20:37] which way
[1:20:39] you want to go
[1:20:41] salvation is free
[1:20:43] to you
[1:20:45] but it cost him his life
[1:20:48] he died on the cross
[1:20:50] shared his blood that we all might be
[1:20:52] saved
[1:20:53] in mind and many of you that's here
[1:20:55] today
[1:20:57] even as young people young children came
[1:21:00] to the lord jesus christ were baptized
[1:21:01] in his name and filled with the holy
[1:21:03] ghost
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:06] and that's a wonderful thing

[1:21:41] and die out to sin
[1:21:44] live an ungodly life
[1:21:47] and spend eternity
[1:21:48] in the lake of fine brimstone which is

[1:22:49] and fight with satan and his angels
[1:22:52] to take god off of the throne
[1:22:55] and replace him
[1:22:57] with satan as the god
[1:22:59] of heaven and on earth
[1:23:01] but thank god for righteousness
[1:23:04] gabriel and all of his angels prevailed
[1:23:07] and the devil was cast out of heaven

[1:23:12] to the earth
[1:23:13] amen the book of revelation said amen i
[1:23:15] saw amen satan falling as a star

[1:23:25] wrath
[1:23:26] and sailing is on a rampage
[1:23:28] and he did not rest day no night
[1:23:31] and he had a lot of help with helping
[1:23:32] him amen because his time is short and
[1:23:36] he's trying to do all he can to deceive
[1:23:38] to steal and destroy your eternal life
[1:23:41] he's trying to keep sinners in bondage
[1:23:44] amen to sin
[1:23:46] i have an opportunity to be saved
[1:23:48] but god has set you free
[1:23:51] thank god for your salvation thank god
[1:23:53] for being filled with the gift of the
[1:23:54] holy ghost

[1:24:54] just five more minutes
[1:24:55] you know
[1:24:56] people don't understand
