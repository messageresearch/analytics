[22:29] us. He watches me.
[22:35] Oh, why should I be
[22:40] bound when God has set me
[22:45] free? And why should you be

[23:00] He's lifted all of your
[23:08] burdens out the
[23:15] way.
[23:18] He the
[23:22] king
[23:24] of my soul.
[23:28] Oh my
[23:36] soul. He
[23:40] is the
[23:43] king
[23:46] of your soul.
[23:53] your
[23:57] [Music]
[24:02] soul. Amen. Thank the Lord for the peace
[24:05] that passes all understanding. We ask
[24:07] the brothers to come forth at this time
[24:09] and ask
[24:11] sister Pan by herself. Praise the Lord.
[24:15] Ask her to share the
[24:19] [Music]
[24:30] Bless the word is come for

[24:56] Maybe you never walked a
[25:00] day in sin.
[25:05] And he never had to lift you
[25:11] up from a life so black that light
[25:15] couldn't enter in.
[25:20] [Music]
[25:23] Maybe he never came at
[25:27] night to dry your
[25:29] eyes so swollen by the
[25:35] tears because of pain and sorrow.
[25:42] No hope
[25:44] of
[25:47] tomorrow down through the
[25:57] years. But he did it for
[26:01] me. Jesus did for me.
[26:10] Oh, and I can't help but praise
[26:15] him when I think of what
[26:19] I used to be.
[26:26] I will receive my
[26:31] gra and I will
[26:33] find
[26:37] you
[26:50] might hear the
[26:56] in my

[27:20] And you never fail a burning
[27:26] hill.

[33:05] Heat.
[33:09] Yeah. Heat.
[33:35] [Music]
[33:40] Praise God. I love you. Amen.
[33:42] Let us just
[33:44] bow. Father, we thank you Lord Jesus for
[33:47] allowing us to come together again in
[33:49] Jesus name. So Lord God, we ask you oh
[33:53] God to look upon us now. Meet every need
[33:56] Lord. Oh God touch the sick and
[33:59] afflicted Lord and those on the prayer
[34:00] list Lord. And Father I pray that you'll
[34:03] move in our midst. But Father we trust
[34:06] you now. Look to you now in Jesus
[34:10] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[34:14] The book of Romans
[34:18] 12. Guess we'll do double
[34:20] hitter 12 and one. It says, "I beseech
[34:26] you therefore, brethren, by the mercies
[34:29] of God, that you present your bodies a
[34:32] living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
[34:34] unto God, which is your reasonable
[34:37] service. and be not conformed to this
[34:40] world, but be you transformed by the
[34:41] renewing of your mind, that you might
[34:44] prove may prove what is that good and
[34:47] acceptable and perfect will of God. God
[34:50] bless you in this word. You may be
[34:52] seated. We talking on Sunday is
[34:55] something on sacrifice. Amen.
[34:59] Uh a
[35:00] sacrifice.
[35:02] Now often times
[35:05] people and and in in this Christian
[35:08] walk it's not many people that's willing
[35:12] to make
[35:14] sacrifices. You know I used to brag on
[35:18] sister Michelle. She used to drive up
[35:20] here all through the week through the
[35:23] week and and on Sundays and that wasund
[35:27] and something miles I mean about 100
[35:29] miles. And then the carols used to for
[35:32] years they drove up from Dollarton three
[35:36] or four uh car loads and that was a you
[35:39] know a sacrifice coming 70 something
[35:43] miles by 80 miles and coming being on
[35:46] time and everything. So a lot of times
[35:50] people make sacrifices to be in the
[35:51] house of the Lord. Amen. Back in the
[35:53] prophet day, people drove from New York.
[35:57] They drove from Ohio. Uh, one brother
[36:01] told me he should drive from Louisiana.
[36:03] Back then, you didn't have this, uh,
[36:05] interstates. It took them uh, a couple
[36:08] of days to get there and a couple days
[36:11] to get back home to be in service on
[36:14] Sunday
[36:16] because and that was a sacrifice.
[36:19] So a lot of times
[36:21] people, you know, when
[36:25] they when they believe that they
[36:28] uh are getting what they need for their
[36:32] soul, then they make sacrifices for it.
[36:36] Amen. So it's it's very
[36:39] important. But I was telling Caleb a
[36:44] while ago, I was just looking at some
[36:46] things in the Foxy book of Malta.
[36:49] And I said, "Caleb, you ready?" He said,
[36:50] "It's it's hard to read. There's some
[36:53] graphic stuff in there." He says, "I
[36:57] read some, but so, you know, the book
[37:00] was on my desk." And I says, and I was
[37:02] just looking back over some things, the
[37:04] sacrifice the saints of old made.
[37:08] He was just telling one story about a
[37:10] man, you
[37:12] know, sitting
[37:14] uh I think on a board or something with
[37:16] the with the priest and he didn't
[37:19] recognize who he was and the priest got
[37:21] upset with him because he wasn't giving
[37:22] him
[37:23] honor and he made some you know probably
[37:26] some sarcastic remarks and
[37:29] stuff and pre and asked him what his
[37:31] name was. Few days later they came and
[37:34] got him and took
[37:36] him and uh put him in
[37:41] prison and in a few days they was going
[37:43] to burn him at the
[37:44] state as a
[37:46] heretic. So it didn't take much to be a
[37:49] heretic just you know because the priest
[37:54] went and told the archbishop this you
[37:57] know this man is a heretic. you had to
[38:00] give the most uh utmost respect to the
[38:05] religious leaders, the priests and folks
[38:08] and and so forth. So by the grace of
[38:11] God, the church
[38:12] itself, I get burned at
[38:15] state and um sometime we see it that as
[38:18] we have these religious walls where
[38:20] people are fighting, they're fighting
[38:22] because they're Muslim. They're fighting
[38:24] because they're Jews. They're fighting
[38:26] because they're this and that. So people
[38:29] will fight for their religion
[38:32] and um but here it says I beseech you
[38:36] therefore brethren that you present your
[38:38] bodies as a what? Living sacrifice
[38:41] living and then h a sacrifice the
[38:45] sacrifice that we sacrifice our bodies
[38:48] we sacrifice our
[38:51] ourselves as a sacrifice. So the if we
[38:56] ask people to make a sacrifice today, it
[39:00] is it it's it's difficult for people to
[39:05] make sacrifices for
[39:07] God. We sacrifice for schooling. We
[39:10] sacrifice for job. We sacrifice for the
[39:13] things that we really want. But the
[39:16] things we really need, we make no
[39:17] sacrifices. We need God.
[39:20] Amen.
[39:22] And it takes a sacrifice. We must be
[39:24] willing to
[39:26] sacrifice. And then if our sacrifice
[39:29] that we're making, is it
[39:31] enough? Is this all I have to offer
[39:34] God? Is just what you know, is it is it
[39:39] acceptable? Will God accept what you
[39:41] giving him right now as your
[39:44] sacrifice? You know, sometimes the
[39:46] little that we do, we get
[39:49] comfortable. We get comfortable just the
[39:52] same old same
[39:54] old and um we get so comfortable in it
[39:58] that we think God is regarding it and
[40:01] God is blessing what we're
[40:03] giving. And I and and and I I'm dealing
[40:06] with yourselves and your life and is God
[40:09] well pleasing with what we're giving
[40:11] him? And I I told him, you
[40:15] know, I I feel like I I need to do more.
[40:20] I feel like I need to give more. I need
[40:22] to do more as a sacrifice to God. See,
[40:26] because the little that we do, we do it
[40:30] because we want to do it. You know, I
[40:33] was battling uh some weather. I'm glad
[40:36] to see Josh here. I battling in a dream
[40:39] last night and I and I said, "Thank
[40:43] God." And it's the sacrifices that we
[40:46] make. Will you make sacrifices for God?
[40:50] Will you make sacrifices for God?
[40:53] Sometimes we battle within ourselves.
[40:55] There's a war going on within
[40:58] ourselves. It was something
[41:01] that we were in such a great revival in
[41:04] my
[41:04] dreams. Great
[41:07] revival. But something had taken over.
[41:11] is taking over my
[41:13] life that we were just
[41:15] moving and it wasn't what I was doing
[41:18] and the way I wanted to go and what I
[41:20] wanted to do is that the spirit just
[41:22] took over and it was just it just
[41:27] revival after revival and the move of
[41:29] God just moving and I know I wasn't in
[41:32] control of where I was going and what I
[41:34] was doing no more. It was just God
[41:37] taking
[41:37] over. And I said, "Oh goodness, what's
[41:41] going on?" I couldn't bring myself out
[41:43] of it because I was just caught up in
[41:45] it. You know, we do this and do that,
[41:49] move here, move that, go this, go that,
[41:51] do that. And it was just God taking
[41:53] over. So, I was it was it was exciting,
[41:57] but I realized I wasn't controlling God.
[42:00] I wasn't doing what I felt like I wanted
[42:03] to do. It wasn't what I was praying to
[42:06] do. It wasn't that I was wanting to do.
[42:10] It was just that the something had taken
[42:13] over and and he was doing it. Amen. You
[42:17] see, he was doing it. And then I I
[42:21] understood they that are led by the
[42:23] spirit of God. Amen. Amen. Not them that
[42:27] leads the spirit of God, but they that
[42:29] are led by the spirit of God. Amen. When
[42:32] the spirit of God is in control of your
[42:34] life,
[42:36] and I said, "Lord, I I want you in
[42:37] control."
[42:39] I want you in the control of my life
[42:41] that I can move and know that you're in
[42:44] the will of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. God
[42:46] coming vindicating what you're doing and
[42:49] where you at. Amen. See, I I I was
[42:52] telling uh Brother Shipman today, I
[42:54] said, you know, you you know, it's a lot
[42:58] of things going on within the framework
[43:00] of the message of the hour.
[43:02] It's a shame. Amen. And he was talking
[43:04] about it's a shame. And that is it is a
[43:07] shame all the stuff that goes on. Amen.
[43:10] Sometimes you will you think, "Oh Lord,
[43:14] this is this is this is it's critical
[43:18] the things that go on." But it's an
[43:21] individual thing. Amen. It's an
[43:23] individual journey. Amen. And we can't
[43:26] get satisfied because we think we got
[43:29] it.
[43:30] But what are we doing with what God gave
[43:32] us? Amen. Amen. What are you doing for
[43:35] God to show God that God I I'm doing
[43:40] something a a and God I believe that you
[43:45] in what I'm doing. Amen. But sometimes
[43:48] we trying to do God a service without it
[43:50] being his will. Amen. Are you with me?
[43:53] Amen. See, if God is not vindicating
[43:55] what you're doing, there's no
[43:58] vindication. Amen. There's no
[44:00] supernatural happening. Amen. See, we we
[44:03] we're moving into a supernatural realm.
[44:07] Amen. We have to have vindication. We I
[44:11] I said, "Brother brother Shipman," I
[44:13] used to call him Major Shipman because
[44:15] when I baptized him over in England, he
[44:17] was Major Shipman. And uh and and
[44:22] brother Shipman, I said I said, "Brother
[44:25] Shipman, what we need is that the the
[44:27] it's time for talk is over. Don't try to
[44:31] explain that to me. All the talk is
[44:33] over." Amen. Because people are talking
[44:37] the talk, but they're not walking the
[44:39] walk. That's right. Amen. Are you with
[44:41] me? Amen. It's time to
[44:44] live. He said, "Present your bodies a
[44:47] what?" living sacrifice. Yeah. Yeah. A
[44:50] living sacrifice and holy. And if God is
[44:53] accept your sacrifice, then he'll come
[44:56] down and consume
[44:59] your offering. Amen. He'll send the fire
[45:02] to consume it. Amen. Amen. Because he's
[45:05] accepted it. Amen. Amen. And and that's
[45:09] what it is. He'll send the fire, the
[45:10] anointing. Amen. He'll send the
[45:12] vindication. Amen. He'll let you know
[45:15] you're walking and I'm pleased with what
[45:17] you're doing. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[45:19] You don't have to Amen. testify of it.

[51:40] had angels worshiping
[51:42] him. But he can't sin. He came down.
[51:46] He came down from heaven. He humbled
[51:50] himself. Amen.
[51:52] Are you with me? Let's just see

[52:43] with God. Equal with God. He I I mean
[52:47] which you and I the Bible said we join
[52:49] with Christ. Are you with me? Amen. So
[52:53] in other words, he's saying if you join
[52:55] us, you equal.

[53:15] ought not.
[53:18] He said that you have a name that you
[53:20] live but you
[53:23] days.
[53:25] Amen. See, sometimes we have the name of
[53:29] Christ, but he said, "Let everyone to
[53:31] name the name of Christ, let him depart
[53:33] from what?
[53:35] Iniquity." So he said, "Nevertheless,
[53:37] the foundation of God standing sure,
[53:39] having the seal the Lord what?" He knows
[53:43] them that are his.
[53:45] Are you with me? God knows them that are
[53:48] his. You must walk circumspectly.

[1:00:40] being in the form of God thought not
[1:00:42] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[1:00:45] of himself no reputation. We're not
[1:00:47] trying to get a reputation here. People
[1:00:49] looking for fame and fortune and
[1:00:50] reputation and all of that. We're not

[1:01:11] what I'm saying? Apostle Simmons or
[1:01:14] whatever. But I ain't looking for none

[1:01:35] people get upset cuz you let them do it.
[1:01:38] They say bishop. They say apostle they
[1:01:42] say brother still giving you respect.
[1:01:46] And some people just call you

[1:02:04] and I'm all
[1:02:05] right. You know, you see what I'm
[1:02:07] saying? Henry's all right.
[1:02:09] Amen. All of that is good because I'm
[1:02:14] not seeking a reputation. Amen. I don't
[1:02:18] I don't worry about that. You ought not
[1:02:20] to worry about
[1:02:21] reputation. Are you with me? Amen. Amen.
[1:02:24] You ought to worry about whether or not
[1:02:26] you're going to be acceptable before

[1:02:53] of a what?
[1:02:55] And was made in the what? Likeness of
[1:02:58] men. Made in the likeness of men. He was
[1:03:00] God. God is a spirit. The word in the
[1:03:03] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:03:04] with God. And the word was God. And the
[1:03:06] word was made flesh. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:11] The Bible say he became sin. And he left
[1:03:13] everything he had heaven. He come down,
[1:03:16] amen, to make be a a living a sacrifice
[1:03:20] for you and I. Amen. The lamb of God to
[1:03:23] take away the sins of the world. He did
[1:03:25] all this for you and you can't do
[1:03:27] nothing.

[1:04:01] God. I'm glad to have eternal life. Are
[1:04:05] you with me? Yeah.
[1:04:09] Some people don't believe it, so they
[1:04:11] don't have it.
[1:04:14] If you don't believe it, you won't
[1:04:16] receive it. Amen. If you don't believe
[1:04:20] that God is good and that God got your
[1:04:27] best in mind. Amen. God want to do you
[1:04:32] good and not evil. Amen. God want to

[1:05:01] Hallelujah. He's been so good to me.

[1:05:53] And being found in the fashion of a man,
[1:05:55] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:05:58] unto death.
[1:06:02] He said, "If any man come after me, let
[1:06:04] him first of all deny himself and take
[1:06:06] up his what?" Cross.

[1:06:12] and take up your cross and what? Follow
[1:06:16] him. And follow him. Are you willing to
[1:06:19] do that as a sacrifice? Because you
[1:06:22] realize the sacrifice that he made for
[1:06:23] you and the sacrifice he made for me.
[1:06:28] Am I willing to sacrifice for him?
[1:06:32] Everything you do, you ought to think
[1:06:35] about
[1:06:36] God, how do you see it? Amen. How do you
[1:06:40] see me? Amen. Because I I I know how I
[1:06:44] see myself. Am I so caught up in myself
[1:06:47] that I don't try to please God in
[1:06:49] everything I do or say? Thank you,
[1:06:51] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Or do I am I
[1:06:53] trying to please God in all? Thank you,
[1:06:55] Jesus. Are you with me? Because in the
[1:06:58] little things, the little foxes fall the
[1:07:00] vine and the little leaven what? Hold
[1:07:05] on. Are you with me? Amen. It's the
[1:07:08] little things that we're going to come
[1:07:09] before God. He says, "Apart from me,
[1:07:11] your work was of iniquity. I don't know
[1:07:13] your wife. You didn't you missed the
[1:07:14] little things. Amen. Praise God. But
[1:07:17] little becomes much.
[1:07:20] Are you with me? Yes. I I got to stop. I
[1:07:23] don't want to fuss too bad. Come on,
[1:07:25] brother. And this is closes out. This
[1:07:27] closes out in your own way. Amen. God is
[1:07:30] good. Amen. You love him. Amen. Are you
[1:07:32] willing to sacrifice?
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:40] Amen. You appreciate the word tonight.
[1:07:42] Amen. Let us stand. Amen.
[1:07:45] You mind worshiping him a little bit? He
[1:07:48] was talking about how good God was. I
[1:07:49] said, you know, I don't mind giving God
[1:07:51] praise. Amen. I don't mind making a
[1:07:54] sacrifice, saying, Lord, thank you. I
[1:07:57] don't mind lifting my hands and saying,
[1:07:58] Lord, I love you. Lord, thank you for
[1:08:01] taking care of me this week, Lord. Thank
[1:08:03] you for keeping me in good health, Lord.
[1:08:06] And thank you for keeping us on the
[1:08:07] dangerous highways, Lord. And thank you
[1:08:10] for touching our bodies, Lord. Thank you
[1:08:12] for going by and see about our family,
[1:08:14] Lord, our children. Oh, God. Thank you,

[1:08:26] of glory. Thank you, Lord, for opening

[1:08:32] out of now way. Lord, thank you, Lord,

[1:08:41] quickening power. Thank you, oh God, for
[1:08:44] your spirit, Lord. Thank you, oh God,
[1:08:46] for saving us, Lord. You could have left
[1:08:48] us where we were, God, but Lord, you
[1:08:51] didn't do that tonight, God. Lord, you
[1:08:53] thought about us, Lord, right where
[1:08:55] we're at. Glory to your name, God. We
[1:08:58] give you praise tonight, God. We give
[1:09:00] you glory, God. We thank you. We love
[1:09:04] you, Lord. As he said, we can't tell it
[1:09:07] all. God, you've been so good to us. Oh
[1:09:11] Jesus, you could have left us where we
[1:09:13] were, but God, you didn't do that. You
[1:09:17] thought about us. You looked on us and
[1:09:19] you said, "Live." Thank you for telling
[1:09:22] me to live. Thank you for speaking and
[1:09:25] giving me ears to hear your word. Thank
[1:09:28] you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] Yes, Jesus. My God. My God. Hallelujah.
[1:09:37] my savior, my Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank
[1:09:41] you, Jesus, for coming down. Thank you,
[1:09:44] God, for coming down, Lord. Thank you
[1:09:46] for dying, Lord. Thank you, oh God. You
[1:09:49] didn't have to do it, but you did, Lord.
[1:09:52] And I thank you tonight, Jesus. Oh, God.
[1:09:56] So many great things you've done for us.
[1:09:59] Hallelujah. I don't want to be found
[1:10:01] guilty not praising you. I don't want to
[1:10:04] be guilty. Not saying thank you, Lord.
[1:10:08] Oh, God. I don't want to be guilty, oh
[1:10:11] Jesus. Not raising my hands. I don't
[1:10:14] want to be guilty, Lord. But God, I want
[1:10:16] to lift my hands. I want to lift my
[1:10:18] voice, God. I want to give you all I
[1:10:21] got. I want to run this race. Oh Jesus.
[1:10:25] Thank
[1:10:28] you. Hey. Hey, Jesus. Thank you Lord.
[1:10:34] Hallelujah. Glory. I thank you. I thank
[1:10:37] you Lord. I praise you. I praise you
[1:10:40] Jesus. Thank you for the blessings.
[1:10:44] Thank you for the move of God. Thank you
[1:10:47] for your spirit. You're not dead, but
[1:10:50] you're still alive. You're still moving.
[1:10:53] You're still showing yourself alive and
[1:10:55] well by many infallible proofs. Yes, you
[1:10:59] are. Thank you. That's what we need. Oh
[1:11:03] Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you. It's worth
[1:11:07] it all. It's worth it all. I know it's
[1:11:12] worth it. It's worth my dying. It's
[1:11:16] worth my crying, living. It's worth my
[1:11:19] giving. I know it's worth it. Oh Jesus.
[1:11:24] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Touch
[1:11:26] somebody heart. Hallelujah. speak to
[1:11:29] somebody's soul.
[1:11:32] Oh God,
[1:11:34] thank you Lord Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[1:11:40] Hallelujah.
[1:11:42] Lord.
[1:11:44] Oh Jesus.
[1:11:46] Hallelujah.
[1:11:48] Oh, we need that rushing mighty wind
[1:11:50] again.
[1:11:53] Oh God, we need a fresh outpouring. Yes,
[1:11:57] Jesus. Yes, Jesus. Something that'll
[1:12:00] push us. Yes, Jesus. Into that realm.
[1:12:02] Yes, Jesus. That realm of sacrifice
[1:12:06] that realm faithfulness
[1:12:10] where our eyes can get off of the world.
[1:12:12] Get off of the carnal things and get
[1:12:15] back to you. That's what we need.
[1:12:19] Hallelujah.
[1:12:20] Thank you.
[1:12:22] Oh Jesus.
[1:12:25] Hallelujah.
[1:12:28] Oh Jesus. Thank you.
[1:12:33] It feels so good to worship God. Amen.
[1:12:38] I feel all right worshiping the Lord.
[1:12:40] Amen.
[1:12:41] I feel all right.
[1:12:44] As the brother pastor was saying
[1:12:46] tonight, he's been so good. Amen.
[1:12:49] [Music]
[1:12:51] In the times when we our faith wasn't
[1:12:53] enough. Yes, Lord. He still showed up.
[1:12:57] He made ways. Yes, Lord. I was telling
[1:13:00] Moses the night, me and him was talking
[1:13:02] on way coming to church and I was
[1:13:03] telling him about some things. I said,
[1:13:06] "Now, no way was that supposed to
[1:13:08] happen." I said, "But God did that."
[1:13:12] God in his infinite mercy did that. And
[1:13:15] I said, "That's what he does." I said
[1:13:17] God wants to bless you. But he won't
[1:13:20] force you to serve him now. Amen. He
[1:13:22] ain't going to force you. One day every
[1:13:24] knee will bow and every tongue will
[1:13:26] confess. But he ain't in the forcing
[1:13:28] business. Amen. Right now, but he's
[1:13:31] saying you could freely come.
[1:13:33] And I said, "God God did this. God did
[1:13:36] that." I was telling him tonight, God
[1:13:39] did so many great things. Yes, Lord
[1:13:41] Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. He did so much
[1:13:44] that it sealed my faith throughout all
[1:13:47] eternity. Amen. Amen. The highs and the
[1:13:50] lows that I might have, it won't cause
[1:13:52] me to turn around. Because I know where
[1:13:54] God has brought me from. Amen. I know
[1:13:56] how good God has already been. What he's
[1:13:59] already done. Hallelujah. He done enough
[1:14:02] already. Come on. He did enough. Come
[1:14:06] on. Don't take him through no more. He
[1:14:07] did enough already. Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:14:11] Do you believe that tonight? I believe
[1:14:13] that. I thank God. I I just love the
[1:14:16] presence of God. Amen. I thank God for
[1:14:19] the word tonight. You know, I was
[1:14:22] thinking that today I says a lot of
[1:14:24] times I says people just move off of
[1:14:28] excitement cuz they everybody excited.
[1:14:31] They think they get excited but when the
[1:14:33] excitement is gone then they they fall
[1:14:37] off.
[1:14:38] I says those coming out of Egypt with
[1:14:41] Moses, they was excited even dancing on
[1:14:44] the other side of the Red Sea. But that
[1:14:47] excitement turned in tears after a while
[1:14:50] because even though they was following
[1:14:52] the prophet Moses, they never got a
[1:14:54] relationship with the God that Moses
[1:14:57] had. And I said, "The thing is what's
[1:15:01] important, you know, it's not just
[1:15:03] excitement, but when you got a
[1:15:05] relationship,
[1:15:07] that makes a difference.
[1:15:09] Cuz when you got that relationship, Yes.
[1:15:12] it's like sunshine in my soul."
[1:15:14] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Every day is a
[1:15:16] good day when God is in my life. Amen.
[1:15:19] Through my highs and through my lows is
[1:15:21] it's more than just excitement. It's a
[1:15:23] relationship now. Come on. God is
[1:15:26] talking to me. He's teaching me
[1:15:28] something. He's showing me something day
[1:15:30] by day. And I said, that's what I I fell
[1:15:32] in love with with God, with the
[1:15:34] relationship with him. Cuz when
[1:15:36] everybody else the excitement is gone,
[1:15:39] God is still there. And I still
[1:15:41] communing with him. Hallelujah. He's
[1:15:44] still taking me through some things,
[1:15:45] bringing me here, bringing me there. And
[1:15:47] I just love that fellowship with God.
[1:15:49] That that that's what never gets old.
[1:15:52] Hallelujah. How many believe that
[1:15:54] tonight? And that's what the ministers
[1:15:55] of God preach to the people to get a
[1:15:59] relationship with Christ. Come on.
[1:16:01] That's what it's about. It'll never get
[1:16:04] old. It'll be new. Be fresh every day.
[1:16:09] Come on. I can't I can't tell you. You
[1:16:11] got to experience that for yourself.
[1:16:13] Sometimes you you say, "Oh, I
[1:16:15] understand." But if you really
[1:16:17] understood, Hallelujah. If a person
[1:16:19] really understood, they'd lay all their
[1:16:22] burdens down. Amen. Come on. Nothing
[1:16:24] wouldn't shake him, not even death
[1:16:26] itself. Hallelujah. I believe that and I
[1:16:30] thank God because it was him all the
[1:16:32] way. How many believe that tonight? You
[1:16:34] know, I want to say one more thing.
[1:16:37] You know, he was talking about the
[1:16:40] sacrifice tonight and
[1:16:43] uh I said it was the year before last, I
[1:16:46] think it was. They hired and it was
[1:16:49] quite a few Muslims at the job and they
[1:16:53] all the time would go wash their hands
[1:16:55] and their feet, I guess, and they'd
[1:16:57] kneel down and pray wherever they
[1:16:59] could. They'd be outside in the cold
[1:17:03] sometimes or in the heat kneeling down
[1:17:06] doing their prayers in front of
[1:17:08] everybody. And they did it in such a way
[1:17:12] we had a meeting and in the meeting they
[1:17:15] says we done cleaned a certain room out
[1:17:18] at the job and we making that a prayer
[1:17:22] room. And I thought I says that ought to
[1:17:24] put the Christians to shame.
[1:17:27] They made a prayer room for the Muslims
[1:17:29] that you want to go in there and pray
[1:17:32] because why? They saw that these people
[1:17:33] were real. The women, they wore their
[1:17:37] long skirts, hot as it was, the black
[1:17:40] skirts all the way to the ground, arms
[1:17:43] covered all the way up, face covered all
[1:17:45] the way up. It'd be 110 degrees in the
[1:17:47] plant, but they was faithful. And they
[1:17:50] went in that room, they'd have their
[1:17:52] little prayer room. I said, "That made
[1:17:53] me jealous." I said,
[1:17:56] "Because with the God we serve." Amen.
[1:18:01] Well, it's a rebuke. Amen. The
[1:18:03] sacrifices that we make versus the
[1:18:05] sacrifices that they make, they made
[1:18:07] such a sacrifice it caused the company
[1:18:09] to establish a prayer room. Even on the
[1:18:12] clock, don't clock out. Go in there and
[1:18:14] pray. I said, "God, what what more what
[1:18:18] what can we do?" Hallelujah. Come on. I
[1:18:22] said, I pray that even tonight we start
[1:18:24] making more of a sacrifice. Amen.
[1:18:27] Because the devil is ramped up. He's
[1:18:29] ramp this power up. But and I know as I
[1:18:33] was saying Sunday, it's going to take
[1:18:34] more than what we got right now. It's
[1:18:36] going to take more than the Holy Ghost
[1:18:38] is enough, but it's going to take more
[1:18:40] than what we doing. God going to have to
[1:18:41] swoop down and give us something. I
[1:18:45] believe that. How many believe that
[1:18:46] tonight? the pushers, all the
[1:18:49] excitement, people saying, "Oh, we" But
[1:18:52] like you said, you walk the walk, you
[1:18:55] talk the talk, but you can't walk the
[1:18:56] walk. The difference between Israel and
[1:19:00] all everybody else was a supernatural
[1:19:01] among
[1:19:02] them. You could be wherever, whatever
[1:19:06] church, whatever, whatever you want to
[1:19:08] be, but that God going to make the
[1:19:12] difference. I believe that God is so
[1:19:15] good. Amen. Let us bow our heads in a
[1:19:17] word of
[1:19:19] prayer. Lord, we thank you tonight for
[1:19:21] your grace, Lord, and all of your mercy
[1:19:24] towards us. Hallelujah. Thank you for
[1:19:26] your love and kindness. Lord, thank you
[1:19:29] for the word, oh God, that we heard
[1:19:31] tonight. It was such a blessing to our
[1:19:34] hearts. Oh God, the
[1:19:39] sacrifice, presenting your bodies as a
[1:19:41] living sacrifice, that's what we want
[1:19:44] tonight, Lord. God, I pray Lord as we
[1:19:48] depart this place but never your
[1:19:49] presence. I pray that the word as is a
[1:19:53] seed God, it went out and it landed on
[1:19:56] good ground. Those that are here and
[1:19:58] those that are listening in that their
[1:20:01] minds might get in tune with you, oh
[1:20:04] God, their hearts might be drawn
[1:20:07] back, oh God, to want to serve you. Do
[1:20:11] it, Lord, I pray. Move in a mighty way.
[1:20:14] Father, we love you. We appreciate you
[1:20:18] for all of your grace and your mercy.
[1:20:20] Thank you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name
[1:20:23] we pray. Amen. Amen.
