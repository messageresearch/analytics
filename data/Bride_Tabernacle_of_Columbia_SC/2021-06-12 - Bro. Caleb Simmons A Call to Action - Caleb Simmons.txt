another week thus far lord thank you for keeping us in our mind and our health and with our strength lord jesus thank you for peace and joy and happiness lord thank you for allowing us to see another day lord to come in your house one more time and be amongst your people lord we ask that you come and just move us out of the way lord may you get all the glory and the honor and the praise lord speak to your people tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen i'd like to ask that you turn to the book of esther esther chapter four verse 13 esther chapter 4 and verse 13. when you got it say amen amen that's esther chapter 4 and verse 13 and a reads the mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with ourselves that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews for if thou altogether holdeth thy peace at this time then shall their enlargements and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou in thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this then answer made them return mordecai this answer go gather together all the jews that present and shoeshine that are present in shushan and fast heat for me and neither eat nor drink three days nights night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him and man god bless to read another word you may be seated tonight we'd like to speak on a little topic called a call to action a call to action in this if you read before the story it goes into it talks about mordecai and how there was a man in the bible whose name was haman and haman had got this spirit of jealousy on him against mordecai and heyman heyman wanted what mordecai had and heyman he looked at mordecai and he said i'm going to do something i'm going to get rid of him better yet i'm going to get rid of all of his people just because of this one person just because of the actions of mordecai and he would not bow down to him he said i'm going to get rid of him and he put out a decree to get rid of to on a certain day at a certain time and had the king to give his approval he would have the opportunity to kill all of the jews and mordecai he sent he sent to he sent to esther and he said he said here in the scripture how do you know that god didn't put you in this place for such a time as this for such a maybe you are the ones maybe god will send deliverance down the line but by that time all your family and everyone your whole household will be wiped out and esther sent back what i call the call to action she said mordecai tell the people to fast and to pray and get down on your knees and after three days i'm gonna go to the king and if i perish i perish and today would like to tell you about to ask that that call to action it's a time that we're living in and it's a season that we're living in that that there has to be some actions behind what we say there has to be a life that's lived behind what you say and the prophet of god he said in the in the message desperation he said i believe that that we're in the days that we're living in where so much and paraphrasing he said there's so much going on and we're seeing the signs of the time we're seeing the way that the people are living we're seeing that we're seeing how things are going and he said that we've got to do something and the greatest weapon that god ever gave us was i remember this the young people did a skit one time and said we got to get this message to jesus we have we got to get this message to him we can't take it over by airplane we can't take it over by train but the only way that we can get the message to them we got to fall down on our knees and pray and that's a call to action that we all have the god has given us all the ability and the grace to be able to get down on our knees and pray and they say that the when the weakest christian gets on his knees with a sincere heart and asks god the devil starts to shake he starts to tremble because he know there's power in the name of jesus there's power when you get down there with a sincere heart and say lord you know you know best you know what it is and we all have that call and that purpose that we must choose as joshua said choose you this day whom you're going to serve because it's going to be required of us at that day when we meet him and we come to that judgment seat and say lord and the lord answer that question what did you do with the life that i gave you and it's that call is that it's that desire that has to be in you then lord i want to get draw closer to you i see the things that are going on i see the times lord i want to draw closer to you and you're calling me to to separate myself and said each one but god but it says that god has to do something many times most of us don't get to that place until and we are in dire need something has happened something has come up and we are in dire need for god to move we are in dire need there is no place that we can turn but to god there's no place many times these moments happen when there's nothing that we can do is go to god and say there's nothing the doctor said no the the lawyer said no the judge said no and we get into those moments in time and say lord now i need you but what an what about getting there before it happens i said the lord has been dealing and said don't get ready be ready don't a lot of times we we we in we think that when it happened we're gonna have time to get ready we're gonna be in uh lord i'm sort of getting get get getting ready but he said don't get ready be ready be ready for for what's going to come be ready for for the you see the sign god never sent judgment without warning he always warns his people and we see the things that's going on we see there's there's different moves of men across the world there's different powers and kingdoms rising up and showing forth their might showing forth and say that we only got so much time left and we can wait till it happens and say oh lord and crying and all to be filled up but by that time will it be too late will it be too late for for for you to get in action said when a soldier goes to battle and all of a sudden the shooting start he can't be looking for his gun he can't be trying to look on the ground oh is it down there by my feet is it under my bed he has to know that he is ready he is prepared he is ready to start this battle and to go in there and say if i perish i perish but i know that god has everything under control when i go because i i met him somewhere i had an experience with him i got down on my knees and god met me and i know the lord is real see you got to know him for yourself you can't depend on someone else's relationship with god and say i'm gonna lean lean on you so you can pull me through i'm gonna lean on you because i know that you know the lord so let me lean on you and see and see if you gonna hold me up too and i said that there's in the scripture where he talks about the the five wise and the five foolish and and the five foolish they they went to lean on the wise and the y i said no go get your own but by the time they went and they were searching and trying to get they realized when they came back they were too late so who are you leaning on are you leaning on jesus are you leaning on somebody else are you leaning on the one that that's all that'll never leave you and never forsake you or you're leaning on someone that knows him and said lord i want to lean on you i want to be able to trust you and when i need you in my time of need i know that you're going to be there in my time of need i know that but lord i want to have that relationship with you whether i get down on my knees i said one of the most wonderful things that ever happened to me in my life was when i prayed one time and i heard that i seen the lord do it exactly what i asked him to say that's that's a person that's when you know the personal relationship with you and god but thinking that every single relationship that you building has to in life is a building process it don't happen overnight if you have a true friendship with anybody in life it took time to build that true friendship it took time to whatever relationship friendship anything that you or partnership it took time to build that over time you developed that and you strengthened it and it takes time to get to certain levels in certain places with god but the only way to do it is down on your knees getting closer to him and sometimes the devil will fight the easiest thing when when you really get serious about it the devil people think well when i get serious about my relationship with god everything going to be easy because i got that determination that don't mean the devil ain't gonna fight you the devil gonna fight you more because because he knows that when you get that real relationship with them that you're gonna be able to do mighty things you're gonna be able to do things that he doesn't want he knows that he doesn't you don't always have to defeat the entire group sometimes all you got to do is take out the leader so if you are the leader and he takes you out he know that the rest of them gonna fall he know that other people around you watching you to see what you're gonna do because you declare that you are a christian but if you're falling in line with them how in the world are they gonna look up to you they say you're doing the same thing i'm doing you setting the standard i said you setting the standard but you're saying it's so low and god requires so much higher but he promised that he would give you the strength to endure he promised that he would give you the strength to be that light and he will make it stronger not you he will make it stronger you take that time and you get into prayer and you get with him and i said many times it it takes it takes a moment like the woman in luke chapter 8 was the woman with the issue of blood she got to that point where she she got so desperate she said i don't even have to have god pray for me i don't have to have jesus pray for me all i need to do is touch the hem of his garment she knew that she got close enough she might have had to i can imagine had to push some people crawl on the ground crawl between some people and try to squeeze through some tight places but she knew if only i can get to jesus everything will be all right and she she took that call and she put in some actions they call you me they said one of the modest mottos of one of the armed forces is many are called but few are chosen many are called but few are chosen and and lord i want to be chosen by you lord i want you to call me where he leads me i'll follow and i'll go with them with them all the way home and said i want lord i want you to lead me and push me because lord lord i need your direction i need your guidance lord i need because i don't want to be outside of your will for my life i don't want to be anywhere that you don't want me to be lord and said in in the bible there was a there was another man there was it was gideon gideon was out there he was attending to his own life and one day god came to him paraphrasing that he said i want to use you to deliver my people and gideon said me me not little me nah lord i'm not worthy but god said no he said well if this be god let me test them he said i'm gonna put the sheep's cloth out there and lord i want the ground to be wet and the sheet cloth to be dry so god did it and then he came back he said well well that let me check it again so he came back the next day and said lord i want the ground to be dry and a sheep claw to be wet and so the next day god did god did what he asked and he came and he came and he run and he checked the cloth the next day it was full of water so much he was able to ring it out of it he said i know this is god so he put out a call to action to the people he put it out and he said he said he and so many thousands of people came and god said they're marching to go to the enemy and he said he said you got too many people and he just like what the enemy triple triple our size maybe even quadruple our size how you saying that i got too many and god said i want to weed some of these people out because not everybody gonna partake in this battle and he went down there and he went to the water and he said the men that do a certain action he said those are the men that you that you want that you want with you so he seen him and he sent everybody that came and everybody that did the certain action he said i want you to come and join because the lord has called you and positionally placed you for this time in in this battle and they got to the battle and he said god he said well how are we going to do this and the lord gave him a plan he said he said i want you to go get a trumpet and i want you to go get i want you to go get lanterns and vases to put over the lanterns and when it on on my signal i want everyone to blow their trumpets and to break the lances and cause it to light up around the whole we're going to encircle them so they got and they spread out all around the camp the enemy and they got there and they said and and they got there and gideon gave the signal and everyone blew their horn that call to action they blew it and this and the enemy thought that it was more than there was they thought it was way more than people than that was and they started to turn on each other and defeat them on cells they started to take them on selves out so just because the enemy is many don't mean that god can't deliver just because the enemy is coming from every side don't mean that god ain't got a plan to deliver you out of out of them all said elijah was sitting in samaria with his servant and they in the in the sumerians had surrounded them and and and in the servant over there he afraid that there ain't no way we gonna be able to defeat him and guys and elijah said lord open up open up his eyes open up his eyes yeah open up his eyes so that he can see that behind the enemy was the angels of god watching over them and was never going to allow them to destroy the assyrians it was was the enemy and they was watching all over them and he was always there god was always there as the songwriter said he was there all the time waiting patiently in line but god was always there so many times god doesn't leave us but we leave him we step away and we we say lord you know i want to do my thing so i'm going to step over here but but when i get ready i'm going to come back and you know we can still continue to march together and as the as the people say as the older people would say the birds of a feather they flock together and certain people god god god don't want you to be around because he know the influence that they're having on you said something one thing that i realized living life and some things and i said i ain't been here for that long but people that you are around have an effect on you whether you realize it or whether you don't and sometimes we get in situations where oh i'm helping them but don't realize the effect that they having on you and how they're causing you to to think certain things and it is until god separates you from them and you see wow i was in a certain mindset or a certain framework that i didn't even realize how much of an effect those people were having on me that's why that's why it's very it's very cautious if you see anyone in the scripture a lot of times you see them around a certain area any man or god any person of god in the scripture they want to be in a certain atmosphere they want to be in a certain around certain people many times you see that's why they have different things where all these different people come together the minds of the world and different places to all these different to put them all in the same place because they want to be as it was on the day of pentecost to try to get on one accord because the devil knows that if we all get in the same place with the same mindset with our mind on jesus that there's nothing that he can do there's no demon in hell that can overtake any one of god's people there's no demon in hell that could stick that can overtake us because he knows that if you get in that one place with your mind stared on him steadfast on on jesus then there's nothing that he can do to defeat you because you know that god has you you know that you know that lord yes some sometimes as the song said i don't believe he brought me this far just to lead me i don't believe whatever god has brought you through when you've had those real those real moments with god you know that god can continue to take you through amen and there was a centurion in the bible if you look in luke chapter seven there's a centurion in the bible he came to jesus because he felt like he needed to take an action his servant had fallen ill and it was one one of his servants and he said i got to go see jesus and he took that action and he came forward and he said i want to go see jesus because i need i need his help i need his help he he was he felt that call and his action went forth that i need i need to go see jesus and he came to jesus he said lord i paraphrase and he said lord i can he said lord i need i need you to heal my servant i'm just asking that you hear my sermon and when the lord said and the lord said that they're serving as well and he said in in the in the centurion and the lord asked him do you do you need like verification for it he said no he said i know that what you said is going to happen and the lord said i have not found greater faith than even in all of israel i've not found greater faith in all the israel that i that he can just send a word and and and people believe it because there was a call to action he there was a call to this to this to this centurion that he needed to go see jesus because he needed something to take place in his life he needed something to to be handled in his life he needed some situation a situation to be worked out and he knew that the only one that could do it was jesus the only one that could bring him forth was jesus so he and the way that god used it was to say to say a word to speak a word some things god just has to speak a word someone just has to speak a word and god and god will move mountains he said when the when the weakest christian all he has to have is the faith of a mustard seed the faith of a mustard seed and it can move mountains uh they said said one songwriter said you move mountains you cause walls to fall and with your power you perform miracles and there's nothing that's impossible because we're standing here only because you made a way and god has made a way and he has called us to to get down on our knees to pray through to get down there and he has called us to lord get in touch with him because we don't need him it's coming that point in time but we've seen over the last few years that we gonna need god because this world is not going in the upward swing yeah it may i said as you said lord and wrath remember mercy because god god always knows but if it's the time and it's the time for us to get up out of here lord i want to be ready i don't want to be getting ready lord i want to be ready lord i want i want you to i want to be prepared not getting prepared lord i don't want to be packing on my bags and say i'm going on a trip lord i want everything to be ready and say lord if it's my time let me go let me go cause lord you you set you set forth the work that i was supposed to do and you and lord you've accomplished it so it's if it's my time lord accomplish what you said you you were gonna do and call and thank you for calling me to action and that not only that lord let me recognize that you call me that you chose me because it's nothing to miss that call don't miss it don't miss it don't miss the call if god is calling you to take the action take that action yeah it may it may be some trials and some suffering that you have to go through and some sacrifice whenever there's a call there's always sacrifice yeah one one one of my co-workers he said whenever you whenever you say yes to something you're saying no to something else so take for instance if you say yes i can work on this but you already working on something else that means that you're saying no to it so i said lord i don't i want to say yes to jesus and no to the devil i want to say yes to heaven and no to hell lord let me say yes to you and know to everything that's not like you lord let me choose you let me choose and sacrifice with you and not not not expecting that god is going to do anything and not and not looking for the reward looking for looking for the thought because i know that lord if you choose to pass you got you got the means to deliver everything that you want to do you got the power to change to change every heart to move everything out of the way that hinders lord you got the path to make every way into the power to make every way straight and lord i just want to say yes to you yes to your call yes lord lord as the songwriter said lord send me i'll go lord send me wherever you gonna send me lord send me i go cause i know that if you send me everything gonna be all right yes jesus and so i said lord let me say yes let me say yes to your call whatever action you want me to take whether it's just mending my needs to pray because we we need more prayer in in this in this world than in this race prayer from one another prayer for prayer for ourselves and prayer for the situations around us because so much is going on and we go through our own our own battles each and every single day because the devil wants you to not grow stronger in god because you know the stronger you get the harder it is to overtake you the harder it is to to take you down and take you out but he said when when you when you be endured with power strengthen your brother strengthen them because we all need we all need the help of one another to make it and it's a call to action that he's calling each and every one of us forward that we may choose him and choose what's right and push forward in the past that lord wherever you want me to go whatever you may want me to do lord send me send me lord and let me heed your call that you call and you push and you placed on my life [Applause] amen praise the lord amen god sent us so we can go amen so by the grace of god i want brother charles to just give us a few words speak to these young people a little bit and i know he got a lot a lot of stories to tell but i'm gonna give him a few minutes tonight uh i'm gonna use them while he's around here you may be around for to just say the rapture but just in case come on let y'all first of all it is indeed an honor and a privilege and a liberty that i you know wholeheartedly embrace thank god amen for the call to action as the young man of god came forth and very encouraging very you know uplifting and you know one of the things that god want all of us to gain is an experience he want all of us to gain an experience so that we can become strong that when that experience comes in our life it doesn't come to hurt us it doesn't come to take us back but it comes to build in us character character you know the bible says by their fruits not by their gifts because my gift will take me there but it's my fruit that'll keep me there you see people looked at saul how tall he was among all the other people you see and we looked at david's brothers how they was bigger than him but yet when samuel came to the house of jesse and all them came before him he said samuel said this is the he said surely the lord's knowing it is among them the lord said no and then god had to remind the prophet he said for god seeth not like man seethe for man looks at the outer the exterior but god looks at the heart what are you saying you're in school and here it is the different ones they're saying well she don't do like me she's a square she's a nerd that's all right by you being different you're gonna make a difference because the same ones that's calling you a nerd and you ain't in trouble like they're in you ain't smoking reefer and you know yes could have cut you off amen yeah you don't interrupt god time oh yeah i don't believe that you know uh and the same ones that's saying that you know you're a nerd or saying you know uh you're a square when they get in trouble you're gonna be the first one
