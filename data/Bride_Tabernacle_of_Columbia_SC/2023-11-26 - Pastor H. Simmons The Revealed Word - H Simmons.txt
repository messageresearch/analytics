53 familiar passage of scripture praise God believe I run on believe I run believe I [Music] run amen I believe I'll run on praise God feel like running amen look over there I told Caleb to be ready all the time he just put his mic on the side and don't obey amen one day he'll catch up who has believed th report and to whom is arm of the Lord reveal for he shall grow up before him as a tend of plant and as a rud out of grage ground he has no form the com and when we should see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he was despised and rejected a men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hear as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has bored our grief and carried our sours yet we esteemed him stricken spitten of God and Afflicted but he was what for you believe that am he was bruised for our what and the chest times of our peace was upon him and with his stripes you believe that praise God healed what his physical mentally amen amen spiritually we healed amen healing comes from the Lord God bless you you may be seated God bless the word amen thank God for everyone press your where out those that are listening in thank God for if we have any visitors thank God for you in Jesus name amen God is good amen want to talk about the revealed word not only the revealed word of this hour but the reveal word amen Prophet God said Revelation means more than any everything to us it means everything because without Revelation amen you just can't see amen but we need revelation we need God to reveal himself to us as individuals amen so if you go to galti uh one galatian 1 the reveal word God has to reveal his word to you if God does not reveal his word to you you'll never see it but God is it's God working on you to reveal himself to you as an individual praise God when something inside of you begin to say Amen to the word that means that God is revealing himself to you amen when there's no amen then you can't see that means you can't even hear you you're blind amen but when there's an amen inside of you and you don't open your mouth and say Amen to the word then that means you can't see amen but when you open your mouth and you said amen to the word that means amen God I understand I see amen that I'm a witness amen that you speaking to me Lord I understand I see amen somebody give you something and you don't say thank you then something is wrong I I I doubt they want to keep on giving you something because you never tell them thank you you just look at it and you just uh begin to enjoy what they give you but you don't never say thank you sometimes you take for granted when Mama fix your food or Grandma fix your fool lay it that for you you don't never say oh this is good compliment oh I really that's very tasty thank you for doing it sometime you take for granted you just sat out and just eat you never tell a thank you amen you got to learn to to be thankful amen see but when when something is revealed to you you begin to tell God thank you Lord I appreciate you amen you know for showing me these things amen from revealing yourself to me Lord thank you but sometimes we don't tell God Amen we don't give him nothing back from what he's given to us amen we need to give God back amen then that's the reason why we serve the Lord because we understand God has been good to us and God is good to us so we tell God thank you amen because of how good he is to us I got a reason to praise him I got a reason reason to let him know Lord thank you for all your blessings thank you for being so good and so real to me Lord I thank you you know other folks amen they don't care what you know they just take for granted and just live life and don't don't never appreciate God giving them life God giving them Health God giving them strength God all God goodness in their life amen for his goodness to me praise God now thank Caleb don't sing that song for his goodness to me thank him for his goodness amen so here it is uh Revelation I mean galatian uh 1 and 11 galatian 1 Paul was talking about uh Angel come from Heaven preaching in the gospel and all of that he said though we an angel come from Heaven preaching in the gospel and that which we preach he said let them be a curse isn't that right but he had to he was dealing with gations that he he he said in the third chapter he said oh foolish galatian who has be with you amen see because the Galatians was Jews that wanted to go back and practice Judaism he said receive you the Spirit by The Works of the law by the hearing of Faith amen it's faith that saved us and faith that bought us from Judy under the law into Grace amen and we received the Spirit by not by what we work for but by the hearing of Faith amen God fill you with the Holy Ghost when you heard the gospel of your salvation preached to you you receive the spirit amen by faith you receive the Holy Ghost it was nothing that you done that you deserve it no work but by the hearing of Faith amen the Holy Ghost begin to amen anoint the word amen and you begin to receive that word when that word was revealed to you and Jesus revealed himself amen the Holy Ghost came in so I'm talking about the revealed word he says Paul was talking about he said uh uh for here he says but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached up me is not after what see you know Paul had a challenge there because they were uh they they were contending with the gospel that he was preaching see because they had the law and they had amen Judaism and whatever but here the gospel of the kingdom was being preached but the people were struggling with it amen even though they were supposed to be church and Believers of the message of the hour that Christ had come amen delivered them out of the Captivity and that he was the lamb that was slain but yet they had a problem with it amen they didn't have a problem with all of it but some of it they were struggling with because they were struggling because they were circumcised and there were others amen that was not circumcised so we were amen struggling look is what we learn by Moses and this is what we learn under the law and some of us are struggling with the message of the hour because we have learned this and we learned that from our denominational belief amen it was all right for that particular time and for that particular space of your life it worked out all right but it came a time when God was taking to the father Revelation revealing himself in a deeper depth but yet we wanted to stay back there are you with me so God reveals to you the word uh of the hour that relates to you for the day and hour you live in amen and he said well I want to hold on to he said no no amen we walk by faith not by sight amen we don't want to amen praise God take and try to eat the Mana amen that fell on yesterday amen yet that manner was good yesterday it's no good for us today because it's got worms in it are you with me so don't try to Amen to live on yesterday NE in your Christian walk should you try to look back to your past and base your present off of your past are you with me amen you you you you're daily walking close to the amen you die daily amen don't let your past amen govern your future and neither your present are you with me so what God is trying to bring you into is trying to bring you out from the past and bring you into the present tense word are you with me but we want to hold on well I remember when I first got saved and how God mve in my life praise God but hey God want to take you amen you he want to take you into maturity he don't want you to stay that baby Amen in the baby stage of your Christian walk God want you to come into maturity neither does God want the church amen to stay in the amen after they come out of of Catholicism under Martin Luther the just shall live by faith God don't want you to stay in that particular State just saying we saved by faith but God wants you to come on in when Wesley begin to preach sanctification Amen to reveal word for that day amen but yet you say well I I'm saved by faith and Faith only that's all I need no you need to go on when the path of the justice that a Shining Light was shining more and more to the perfect day are you with me so God as you see light you walk in light you don't stay I got it all now I don't want to oh come on Amen you don't want to stay in first grade all your life and you don't want to stay in baby St somewhere you got to start walking amen and we got to grow up amen we got to be able we can't stay with Mom and Daddy all the time we got to get our own place are you with me y'all said look who talking but we got we got we got to grow up isn't that right and we got to get on our own we got to learn how Amen to come into maturity isn't that right praise God it's all right to have amen Mom and Daddy got your back but it's time for you to grow up and get your own Revelation amen for your own house come on you got to get out of Mama house you got your own family to raise praise God grandma and granddaddy can't raise your family you got to raise them they can help you all right but help don't put all that pressure on them are you with me they here to help you and give you advice but you got to do your job are you with me they don't mind helping amen but do your job amen oh God praise God ain't God good I can't I can't I don't know how I got off on that but y'all all right he said the gospel which I preach was not after the man so we struggle we struggle with the go gopel trying to tell the people the gospel in which we preach is not after man amen praise God I'm not preaching a gospel to satisfy any man are you with me and you must uh also certify that the gospel which you believe is not after man amen what you believing and what you standing on the god that save you amen I I'm convinced that God saved me praise God Amen I was telling the brother the other day I said you know it the the faith can anybody talk you out of your salvation that you know that you know that you know that you're saved you know that Jesus died for your sin do you know that amen that you don't have to be a sinner any longer because Jesus Christ died for your sins but the only reason reason uhh you keep sending because you don't believe it are you up me say if I believe that he did it then you know if I got a million dollars in the bank I can go to the bank and I can get some money but if I say I got a million dollars in the bank and don't never go to the bank and cash this struggling trying to you know pay my bills and all and I got to million dollars in the bank I why should I do all that struggling when I got the money there all I got to do is come well I'm strugg how can you struggle to live right and do the right thing when Jesus already paid the price but yet I'm struggling oh I can't man what you talking about you got a million dollars in the bank and you hear crying with me I I know how to pay the bill I don't know how I am a make it you got a million dollars in the bank what you talking about I can't convince you to go down to the bank and draw out of the bank some of that money you got in the bank how you get in the bank I ain't put it in the bank somebody W it to you they gave it to you it's your inheritance huh inheritance they gave it to you by inheritance I ain't work for that money I ain't going Lord have mercy what I I somebody gave me the money yeah they gave it to you what you think I'm going go down there and and arrest me for getting the money out yeah they might arrest you because you don't you you you you don't think yourself to be worthy but he's made you worthy if you accept what he's done for you and the reason why people are not drawing from The Riches of his grace and his Mercy is because they don't realize how rich his mercy and Grace is for their lives God is rich in Mercy he'll forgive you of anything you ever done amen and you got to just receive that that you know that and you ask him that and you believe that it has happened are you with me was you sit down I tell you I wish I was free the Bible say whom the son set free is what I I wish I was saved man I've been trying to get saved all my life I've been trying to get saved ever since I heard that Jesus died for my sin I was trying my best to get saved I was trying to believe it but I I thought I believe believed one time but you know I thought what I believe I thought I had it but I didn't get it cuz I I thought I had it I thought I had it I had it I had the Holy Ghost I had I I was saved I I was happy and I was saved I thought I I thought I really got it I got religion I got God somehow I I don't know what happened I don't know what happened I must have lost it somewhere see uh it's something about uh your state of mind it's the state of your faith when it's revealed to you by Revelation nothing can shake your faith you know that song said I let nothing shake my faith in God don't let nothing shake your faith in God are you with me but if somebody can shake your faith that means amen you need to go back and get a deeper Revelation because Jesus blood has never lost has never lost its power amen so I got to read this but I'm going tell you brothers and sisters this Christian life is all right being a Christian is good you don't know how good it is cuz you never taste it oh yeah I've been saved I've been saved I don't know praise God they tasted of the good the fruits but they were scared to go into the land are you with me because they were afraid of the Giants the wall cities you can't be afraid to go into the land amen because the land is your promise is is for you God has given you oh bless you with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus it says I mean why why why does why does this this Paul why is he struggling with these people these this saved Church these people that supposed to be saved why am I struggling with them okay he he's trying to he's convincing them he's saying neither receive I a man neither was I taught it amen he went to the Seminary and learned under gomea he was a bright student some people say he spoke seven different languages and all of that and things like that they talk about Paul you know is a great scholar of the of the word of God and all of that but yet he said he was well taught and well learned but he said I wasn't taught what I'm preaching now he said I I wasn't taught it a man amen the church that I came from and the synagogue that I used to and the school I went to I wasn't taught this a man I Ain a't giving man no credit for what I'm preaching now are you with me and when you get it right you Ain giving the church no credit for it you ain't giving the brother Simmons no credit for it you giving God the glory are you with me are you with me see that's what it come down to Paul ain't taking nothing away from but he giving all the glory to who to God okay let's just see how he do neither will I taught it a man but by what revelation of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters it's very important that you receive Revelation without Revelation you can always doubt yourself you can always have a little doubt and a little fear sometimes you're up and sometime you're down sometime you're in sometime you're saved sometime you're lost sometime you heal sometime you're sick you know you never doubt God being your healer it it doesn't matter how rough life get you never doubt God saving you he's my savior he's my healer and I don't care how sick I get he's still my healer I don't care how rough life get he's still my savior I will not deny him are you with me for ye have heard of my conversation in time pass in the Jewish religion how beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God in other words I came against what I'm preaching now what I'm preaching now I persecuted are you with me it it's something that I'm standing here in in defense of what I persecuted put people in jail I was there when stepen was stoned to death just show you what kind of zeal I had for what I believe praise God but here I am with what y'all think is something new and I'm trying to tell y'all y'all in the church y'all have come out amen and and came to the kingdom but yet y'all still struggling you come out of mystery babon come out of a denominational system but you're struggling struggling with whether not what I believe is right or not struggling with what what I believe what is the word struggling they're struggling but Paul is trying to certify trying to let them know amen this ain't no man done praise God this is not I I didn't get this from man amen he said by re by revelation of Jesus Christ I'm going tell you A lot of people just saying what the prophet saying saying what the message said and they ain't got no Revelation Paul didn't did it that way I got it by Revelation a lot of people go to church Mama Church daddy Church Grandmama Church amen but they ain't got no Revelation they save according to amen what they think and not what they believe are you with me but you got to get it down in the inside something got to re oh Hallelujah you got to have that personal experience God got to come and visit you as an individual amen it's not the crowd not the one sitting next to you the one sitting next to you don't even want God sometime but you want God Amen you can't convince your brother your sister your friend but it's God got to convince you when God saved you he saved you as an individual not a group is you and God Alone Oh God he said in the Jewish religion how Beyond meure I persecuted Church of God and wasted it man I was destroying it man I a believe that I believe that stuff believe don't message you mean to tell me something wrong with Moses something wrong with Abraham something wrong with Isaac and Jacob something wrong with what we believe no you a gonna convince me what I got ain't right you you coming against the truth that's what Paul thought Saul of tashes you coming against the truth I ain't going to let nobody come against what I believe I'm standing up for it brother you ain't got a revelation of coming out of mystery of Babylon if you ain't got a revelation of the word you stay right in there you come out but you stay right in that mindset are you with me you keep that same go uh uh uh Dogma in that dogmatic spirit spirit that same attitude that we had over there you'll bring it over here and you can't eat the word same thing that was in Egypt they bought it out of Egypt they came out but they bought Egypt with them are you with me they bought the same spirit that was in Egypt they bought it over in the wilderness and they never made it to the promise all that blessings that was waiting on them all that God had given them they never ever received it because they had Egypt in them and God took them through the Wilderness to try to get egyp out of them but yet they didn't have a problem with Egypt are you with me but when they were in Egypt they cried out God God help us God delivers God you know sometime folks look like when I was in the world I had friends when I came to the church people weren friendly I had a problem with church people I ain't want to get close to none of them cuz I know they ain't right okay brothers and sisters if you want friends show yourself what friendly are you with me don't set out you know set to yourself and go to yourself and just get with a group and you know Show Yourself friends you have friends I don't need no friends I got I got me and mine and I don't need nobody else but when you get to heaven you're going to need somebody else amen you you're going to look around it won't be black or white Chinese or Russians or whatever it'll be the people from every nation never kreds and you got to be able to receive everybody I it ain't going to be no black and white thing and ain't going to be no Chinese and uh uh uh Hispanic or whatever it's going to be whosoever will and God going to have people from every nation isin't that right so you got to get out of the attitude that amen I one brother told me was coming for years and he said you know I had to get where the people worship you know y'all worship black and I want to get where the white people at where they worship white I said you know that that sound but you know I enjoy y'all now I enjoy y'all but I want to get I hope we don't get like that I hope we get where God want us to be and then we're not moving because of color or because of you know this or that but we're moving because the spirit say move are you with me I'm I'm GNA tell you something okay I got to go that ain't got nothing to do with the message this morning but it got something to do sometimes with what we choose we choose our path but let it be the spirit pray about what you do just don't do things because you know this is the way I see it out there and if out there it look good out there like that I see it like that and you know and what I see what you see a lot of time as sister Carol say you can't believe Your Lying Eyes what you see out there it it ain't all sometime you don't know what's under the the current praise God I almost got drowned it because we were out crabing no lamb or SC I don't know what we doing out there in the marsh out there in by the seaside we had to go out on the boat the tide went in and then Jim left us so we trying to get back to shore so it's a little river you you you cross and it wasn't that wide about wide at the church I said because I ain't swimmed in a long time I swim across there and go on to the other side so we got to the to the Little River I said okay we getting ready to jump in the people come running out the restaurant telling us not to and they came and got us on a boat and took us across it made me look like a little river but it had undercut if we' have jumped in they would have shoot us out to the ocean we' have drown and you see what I'm saying so it look like a little I can I can't swim much but I can swim across this little screen see what I'm saying so don't don't look sometimes at the outward appearance because you don't know the undercurrent a lot of things going on underneath that you can't see on the top of it look like a little bit of water but all that undercover you can't see it with your eyes but it's got a lot of undercurrent and don't let's let's make sure that it's it's not a lot of undercurrent in our lives the outside look good but on the inside it's a lot of undercurrent praise God sweeping you right out in the darkness right out in the world are you with me and it's the undercurrent that'll get you it's not the top amen what you see out there on the top is the undercurrent amen because you can see on outside oh man I see that I see this you see that all you looking at our sight amen you'll never see amen if that the if David wouldn't have never been chosen by eyesight are you with me but God saw a man out his own heart when nobody in the family saw him they didn't even count him worthy to even call him but Samuel

struggling on the outside you might be going through things mentally but is inside your soul it's a jean seed of life something down deep that's keeping me and holding me together what I should have far apart but I got a press on me I got something on the inside telling me to go ahead anyhow it's a jean seed I can't explain it somebody said why you go to church like that why you go and listen to amen a gospel like that why you go and listen to Jesus I know that Jesus is real amen I know that Jesus is real I can't explain to you why I'm happy and why I know am me the truth is the truth and the word of God Is Right amen praise God I ain't got no doubt in my mind the word of God is right and I believe the word praise God some folks struggle with this Bible they wrestling against the scripture to their only destruction amen so here in the 14th verse and I profit in the Jewish religion above many my e my in my own Nation being more exceedingly zerious of the traditions of of my fathers amen I know what it's like to to have the Traditions I know he knew amen Grandmama Granddaddy and everybody religion you know know what it's about life amen tradition of the fathers but when it what when it what I'm going tell you something when it pleased God this is one of my scriptures when I first got saved when it pleased God Amen I thank God it meant something to me when it pleased God and it says who what separated me from my mother's and what name brand and you know High School you throwing back your coat when you see Britain and all of that because all of that Min stuff that's junk now it ain't nothing a junk a bunch of nonsense bunch of mess you said what it meant something oh yeah said what you call it nothing it mean nothing now are you with me but trying to rip you off on your money people ripping you off po folk trying to be rich are you with me save your money amen get you something that's gonna be of value amen life amen is valuable keep living like that you to impress others you know you ain't living to impress others and to please men he said it's not out the man I'm I'm not trying to please man no more not worrying about how how I look on the outside it's what you got on the inside do matter praise God you want to be impressed and you want to look cool look fly amen that's all right just keep on doing it but it comes a time in your life you want to be a Christian I want to look holy I want to be holy I want to look like a saint of God I want to I want to see in Jesus I can stand before him and say God do you like how I look I look in the mirror I said God are you pleased with how I look and sometime we look in the mirror you know you don't even like how you look how you think God like it are you with me see but when it please God he he's got to reveal himself to you if if you just go to church and you're just doing it for others but if you're doing it amen to please God then ask God God you are you pleased with the way I live are you pleased with my way I walk are you pleased with me see because Paul is talking about when it pleased God who called me by his grace and then he he says he what to the 16 verse to what where to reveal his son where see what I'm saying he's got to be revealed not to you see because we said he oh yes God had revealed himself to me there a difference between revealing himself to you and revealing himself are you with me he said to [Music] reveal his son where see that I mean it it just it lit up to me he revealed his son in me see because a lot of people amen see him from the outside I know Jesus is God I know this and that all that is knowledge but when he Reveals His Son in me are you with me it's no longer outside amen but it's an inside experience I'm talking about the inner court experience I'm not talking about the outside court but I'm talking about the inner Court I'm talking about something down inside of your soul I'm talking about something that's bubbling from the inside oh Jesus Jesus on the inside working on the outside brought about a change in me praise God but is it just outside and you see it from the outside and you can convince people outwardly amen but it's got to be something brother amen what we talk about in Sunday school brother friend it's got to be inwardly praise God it's got to be something down on the inside brother sister when he Reveals His Son in me praise God hallelujah that's why the anointing that you receed that you need not that any man teach you when you get the Holy Ghost on the inside it'll teach you all things are you up me

heathen immediately I conferred what amen see sometime you going to ask somebody else well how did I do how did this and how did that I confer not with flesh and blood praise God I confer not with flesh and blood because what I receive I wasn't taught it a man I receive it for man amen but God gave it to me by his grace I am what I am praise God I'm not following a man I'm following the word

but I'm following Jesus amen because he revealed his son in me amen praise God I'm standing with the word praise God I got to see the Bible amen it's a new book he said reveal his son in me see let's go to John 4 uhuh I will skip John one I tell you what I just just quote I'm I'm gonna tell you something the Pharisees and Sadducees and looking right at the word and they couldn't see it he said I didn't confer with flesh and blood Matthew uh 16 tells us about he said who the men say I the son of man am are you with me and see some people don't know who he is today they think they know because they just heard that Jesus saved but by Revelation he he hasn't been revealed to them amen and even Peter that said thou the Christ the son of the Living God even Peter even when he said that later only in his journey he Deni Jesus three times that's why he needed something on the inside to back up the Revelation that Jesus God had given him he needed an inside experience he needed conversion on the inside he needed the Holy Ghost are you with me because even though he said thou the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed are thou Simon vagina for what Flesh and Blood ha not what he said Paul said that I didn't receive it a man he said you know this is not a flesh and blood of fa sometime I think we Le too much of flesh and blood but flesh and blood has not revealed us un thee but my Father which is in the heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church upon this Revelation I'll build my church it's got to be revealed reveal to you amen you need Revelation amen more than
