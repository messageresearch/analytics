[58:26] he get sweeter and sweeter doesn't he as
[58:29] the days go
[58:30] by we've we've had two meetings today we
[58:34] had a minister meeting this morning at
[58:38] breakfast and I would just say we all
[58:42] witnessed the presence of God come in
[58:44] that
[58:46] room we had a young people service this
[58:50] afternoon and we watched God just come
[58:52] in another
[58:54] way and tonight I believe believe he's
[58:56] going to come one more
[58:58] time we've been praying we've been we
[59:00] made mention
[59:02] yesterday that today we would Orient the
[59:05] service toward having prayer and a
[59:08] prayer line I want to just make a couple
[59:10] of statements about that briefly if I
[59:13] can in the message Satan's
[59:16] Eden brother Ram said they asked why
[59:19] didn't brother Neville preach on the
[59:21] Holy
[59:22] Ghost this morning and he said the Holy
[59:26] Ghost is the action in you it's a life
[59:32] it's not an emotion it's not some sort
[59:36] of a fleshly
[59:38] evidence but it is the
[59:40] person Jesus
[59:43] Christ amen and then he
[59:46] says Jesus Christ the word of God
[59:49] established in your heart to Quicken
[59:52] every word of this age amen he says
[59:56] watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so
[1:00:01] much in
[1:00:03] demonstration but in action
[1:00:07] amen we have brother Ron Spencer here
[1:00:10] tonight brother Ron is a Gifted Man he's
[1:00:13] a pastor he's a
[1:00:16] minister but he's also been gifted in
[1:00:19] other
[1:00:21] manners brother Brandon would tell us
[1:00:24] there's no better way than
[1:00:27] accepting your healing your need
[1:00:29] Deliverance than believing his
[1:00:31] word but he said if we can't do that
[1:00:34] that ought to be enough he said but if
[1:00:37] it isn't then he comes down and he set
[1:00:40] in the church gifts yeah and he said
[1:00:44] now the minister can teach the word and
[1:00:48] that we ought to believe outright but
[1:00:51] then look at the goodness of
[1:00:54] God he sends something else he sends
[1:00:58] servants and Prophets and so forth with
[1:01:01] discernment of spirit and so
[1:01:04] forth so we believe the Lord's going to
[1:01:06] use his vessel
[1:01:08] tonight so we're going to let brother
[1:01:11] Ron come to the pulpit we're going to
[1:01:13] give him the Liberty we're going to
[1:01:16] sacrifice our thoughts our minds we're
[1:01:18] going to put our focus on one thing last
[1:01:23] night was another level
[1:01:27] it wasn't brother Ron in the latter part
[1:01:29] of that
[1:01:30] service so let's as we said let's our
[1:01:34] put our faith to what God has set forth
[1:01:36] for us there's provision you'll lay
[1:01:39] hands on the sick and the sick shall
[1:01:42] recover in my name they'll cast out
[1:01:45] Devils that's our promise that's our our
[1:01:48] our inheritance that's our Authority

[1:01:54] that let's just sing the

[1:05:55] he's came in every
[1:05:58] service even this morning in The
[1:06:00] Minister's breakfast it was it was so
[1:06:04] overwhelming his awesome
[1:06:07] presence today in the youth Service as
[1:06:10] we as we watched and you were a part of
[1:06:14] we watched God speak and turn speak to
[1:06:18] you and take a vessel and use him if we
[1:06:22] can only recognize it's the voice behind
[1:06:25] The Voice
[1:06:27] none of us came to see man even as we
[1:06:30] turn our hearts toward tonight of of a
[1:06:33] prayer
[1:06:34] line you know no man's A
[1:06:38] Healer no man's A
[1:06:41] Healer but when our faith reaches
[1:06:44] another
[1:06:45] level reaches unto
[1:06:48] God you can walk out in this building a
[1:06:52] a very sick individual even unto death
[1:06:56] but you can walk out totally
[1:06:58] healed now let me just ask you we've all
[1:07:01] sit in doctor's offices for hours and
[1:07:04] hours and
[1:07:07] hours been patient with that and they're
[1:07:11] only practicing
[1:07:13] Physicians there's a doctor in the house
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:21] now some things in your conditions are
[1:07:24] too private to even
[1:07:27] speak but God
[1:07:29] hears and he answers
[1:07:32] prayer Sarah is there anything
[1:07:38] impossible with
[1:07:40] God and he's the same God
[1:07:43] today maybe you'd lift divide gravity
[1:07:47] and lift your hands before the Lord and
[1:07:48] say Lord
[1:07:49] Jesus Remember
[1:07:53] me some man would scream thou son of
[1:07:57] David have mercy on me amen even in
[1:08:01] addressing him out of order God still
[1:08:07] heard he hears your
[1:08:10] prayer he knows your thoughts he knows
[1:08:12] what you've been going
[1:08:15] through you may say well brother Ron
[1:08:17] it's just impossible I've suffered with
[1:08:19] this for years with our
[1:08:23] God there's nothing
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:30] impossible maybe even now you would say
[1:08:32] brother
[1:08:34] Ron I've got
[1:08:37] children that don't know Jesus that's
[1:08:40] right they know
[1:08:42] church but they don't know
[1:08:46] Jesus maybe you don't know
[1:08:49] Jesus you know him by a
[1:08:53] story or even a prophet's vook
[1:08:56] voice but Jesus is in the room
[1:09:01] amen Heavenly
[1:09:05] Father we feel your awesome presence
[1:09:07] even
[1:09:10] now Lord as we come we have surrendered
[1:09:13] ourself to
[1:09:16] you phenomenal Minister standing in this
[1:09:21] room Lord what great men that you've
[1:09:24] placed here
[1:09:27] but you placed them here for a great
[1:09:29] bride that's right a people of your own
[1:09:35] choosing while we're here in this
[1:09:37] Humanity we have great
[1:09:40] needs many needs are so
[1:09:43] difficult almost unmanageable so hard to
[1:09:47] even talk about not just needs in the
[1:09:50] flesh but in the
[1:09:52] spirit maybe the darkness of
[1:09:56] depression that thing can be broke
[1:09:59] tonight maybe there's people that know
[1:10:02] you but they're backsliding in their
[1:10:05] Spirit things have just got in the
[1:10:08] way maybe they've been
[1:10:12] hurt Lord you've never hurt
[1:10:15] one it's
[1:10:16] your it's maybe men and their own
[1:10:20] carnality that's done

[1:13:03] amen love
[1:13:07] you we're
[1:13:13] friends for those that are very familiar
[1:13:15] with the message you will identify with
[1:13:17] us next
[1:13:20] scriptures in every prayer line service
[1:13:25] brother Brandon would you would either
[1:13:27] would read these scriptures or he would
[1:13:31] talk about the
[1:13:35] story it was a story of
[1:13:38] Redemption where Jesus would go out of
[1:13:40] his
[1:13:41] way for one that's
[1:13:45] right John chapter 6 chapter 4 and verse
[1:13:48] 6 now Jacob swell was there and Jesus
[1:13:52] therefore being wearied with his journey
[1:13:55] sat thus on a well as it was about the
[1:13:59] sixth hour and there cometh a woman of
[1:14:02] Samaria to draw
[1:14:04] water and Jesus saith unto
[1:14:08] her give me to
[1:14:10] drink for the disciples were gone away
[1:14:13] unto the city to buy meat brother
[1:14:15] brandham said that he sent them
[1:14:18] away and then saith the woman of Samaria
[1:14:22] unto him how is it that thou be in a Jew
[1:14:25] ask drink of me which am a woman of
[1:14:30] Samaria for the Jews have no dealings
[1:14:32] with the
[1:14:33] Samaritans and Jesus said unto her if
[1:14:38] thou knewest the gift of God and who it
[1:14:41] is that saith to thee give me to drink
[1:14:45] thou wouldest have asked of him and he
[1:14:48] would have given thee Living Water
[1:14:56] and the woman which saith unto him sir
[1:14:59] thou H has nothing to draw with and the
[1:15:02] well is deep from when then hast thou a
[1:15:07] a living
[1:15:08] water art thou greater than our father
[1:15:12] Jacob which gave us the water the well
[1:15:16] and drink thereof himself and his
[1:15:19] children and his cattle and
[1:15:23] Jesus answered
[1:15:25] and said unto her whosoever drink of
[1:15:28] this
[1:15:29] water shall thirst
[1:15:32] again but whosoever drinketh of the
[1:15:35] water that I shall give him shall never
[1:15:40] thirst but the water that I shall give
[1:15:43] him shall be in him a well of water
[1:15:46] springing up to everlasting
[1:15:50] life and the woman saith unto him sir
[1:15:54] give me this water that I may that I may
[1:15:57] thirst not neither come hither to draw
[1:16:00] and Jesus said unto her go call thy
[1:16:05] husband and come hither and the woman
[1:16:08] answered and said I have no
[1:16:10] husband and Jesus said unto her thou
[1:16:15] Hast said well I have no husband for
[1:16:19] thou H has had five
[1:16:21] husbands and he whom thou now Hast is
[1:16:25] not thy
[1:16:26] husband in that sest thou
[1:16:34] truly I think as we would begin this
[1:16:38] service brother brandham wouldn't just
[1:16:40] tell that story over and over again the
[1:16:43] same Messiah sign has been displayed in
[1:16:45] this
[1:16:47] generation that same gift none of us
[1:16:49] pretend to be a prophet or that's that
[1:16:52] gift was one to a generation to
[1:16:55] and so we we realize that we realize
[1:16:58] even in this building that we're not
[1:17:01] looking to a
[1:17:04] man we'd be quick to do that now what
[1:17:07] I'm doing is getting rid of scarecrows
[1:17:09] here
[1:17:10] first and very and very quickly we would
[1:17:14] identify that that the same Jesus was at
[1:17:18] that well is setting at your well
[1:17:25] and maybe even you would be in denial of
[1:17:27] where you're
[1:17:28] at but Jesus already
[1:17:32] knows now he's not ashamed to come to
[1:17:35] your
[1:17:35] well because he's looking past your
[1:17:40] condition he's not even looking at your
[1:17:43] situation he's looking at the seed that
[1:17:45] was placed on the inside of you and you
[1:17:49] were worth coming to Edmonton for
[1:17:55] so he'll go out of his way to come to
[1:17:58] one tonight it be me
[1:18:01] many so you can come to the well tonight
[1:18:04] and expecting one kind of water and
[1:18:07] leave with a complete different kind of
[1:18:13] water now we do this by a higher
[1:18:17] authority we were commissioned by the
[1:18:19] scriptures to lay hands on the
[1:18:22] sick and we're not the Healer that's
[1:18:25] right but the scripture says that they
[1:18:28] shall
[1:18:31] recover and so we take him at his word
[1:18:35] now Faith so many times we want to try
[1:18:38] to manufacture Faith but but let me just
[1:18:41] say this to you faith is expecting God
[1:18:45] to do what he said he would
[1:18:50] do now when you ask him to save you and
[1:18:53] he come into your life and and you
[1:18:55] accept salvation your garment changes
[1:18:59] and you're no longer the person that you
[1:19:01] used to be and he begins to clean you up
[1:19:04] and take habits out of your life now
[1:19:07] there's not a preacher here that can
[1:19:08] clean
[1:19:10] you we can preach a whole lot of
[1:19:13] legalism and preach how to clean our
[1:19:15] lives but God can take the
[1:19:18] [Applause]
[1:19:20] desire he can take the desire he can
[1:19:23] take the unbelief
[1:19:26] and you may not be a believer tonight or
[1:19:28] even be a make believer where you're at
[1:19:30] but you don't have to stay that
[1:19:33] way and I'm not here to condemn you to
[1:19:36] be in your condition but I can tell you
[1:19:38] you can walk out of this building even
[1:19:40] if you've served the Lord 50 years you
[1:19:43] can walk out of here refreshed in a new
[1:19:46] Revival like never
[1:19:50] before I preached about 40 years now we
[1:19:54] preached about Revival coming we
[1:19:56] preached about the great things that is
[1:19:58] going to be among us that's here
[1:20:03] now that's here now services like that
[1:20:06] we're having all over the world you
[1:20:09] don't have to manufacture it we're not
[1:20:12] feeding on the personality of a man
[1:20:15] we're not trying to work anything up
[1:20:17] he's
[1:20:19] here and let me just say he's not here
[1:20:22] by accident he's here to fulfill
[1:20:25] word and he's on a
[1:20:27] mission that's right the our Prophet had
[1:20:30] to leave the scene but the angel didn't
[1:20:33] leave the
[1:20:34] scene and he's here to make sure that
[1:20:37] the word is accomplished in your
[1:20:41] life so this is the bride's
[1:20:47] Revival and we're feeding on the word
[1:20:50] and it's manifestation of the word and
[1:20:52] it's not just a dead letter but said
[1:20:54] it's a
[1:20:58] life that's right now we realize that
[1:21:01] Satan can't get to that Gene seed of
[1:21:03] God that was placed there before the
[1:21:07] foundation of the world you understand
[1:21:10] in future home you were born and it was
[1:21:11] almost like two Natures inside of you
[1:21:14] but one laid dormant and then under the
[1:21:16] right atmosphere that seed of God came
[1:21:19] to life inside of
[1:21:21] you amen now you never was let me just
[1:21:24] say you never was a a pig in
[1:21:28] your you never was that that that out
[1:21:32] there you acted like an alien you always
[1:21:35] was a Son of God but you didn't act like
[1:21:38] it but one day God rich in
[1:21:48] Mercy this is a healing service but you
[1:21:51] remember
[1:21:53] when all of us has got that story we
[1:21:55] remember when when he came down rich and
[1:21:59] mercy in our
[1:22:00] lives and what a miracle it was he took
[1:22:03] a drunk or he took a dope addict or he
[1:22:06] took a religious person that was dead
[1:22:08] sitting in a Pew and he brought him to
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:13] life and you didn't have to make
[1:22:15] yourself go to church anymore you didn't
[1:22:17] have to make yourself loved God it was a
[1:22:20] spontaneous fountain that became alive
[1:22:23] inside of you
[1:22:25] you you couldn't wait till those doors
[1:22:28] came
[1:22:29] open you were baptized in the name of
[1:22:32] the Lord Jesus Christ and came under the
[1:22:35] identification and then God filled you
[1:22:37] with the Holy Ghost and he sealed you
[1:22:40] with his own life like a breath of fresh
[1:22:44] air it be to breathe on the inside of
[1:22:50] you but that didn't change your flesh
[1:22:54] that's right your flesh is still a
[1:22:57] sinful
[1:22:59] flesh and God sends you the Holy Ghost
[1:23:02] to put Reigns and Dominion on your flesh
[1:23:06] and that faith that word of God keeps
[1:23:08] your body under
[1:23:11] control and when that old nature wants
[1:23:13] to rise itself up inside of it you by
[1:23:16] the word of God call it back to order
[1:23:24] are you with me that's why we need a
[1:23:27] body change that'll be the greatest
[1:23:29] healing line ever in the
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:33] earth oh brother Ron I don't know so
[1:23:35] much about these Divine Healing in the
[1:23:38] message and prayer lines in the message
[1:23:40] let me just say there's going to be a
[1:23:42] prayer line around the
[1:23:44] world one glorious day
[1:23:47] break between 6 and
[1:23:53] 9:00 there's going to be a tiny light
[1:23:55] come down and change your body from
[1:23:58] Mortal
[1:24:00] immortality never to have another gray
[1:24:03] hair and never to be sick again oh what
[1:24:06] a day that will
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:18] be thank you Lord because Adam
[1:24:22] fell we get
[1:24:27] sick because Adam fail in our spirit we
[1:24:31] become
[1:24:33] weary there's many different things that
[1:24:35] he afflicts us with memories of the
[1:24:38] past haunts us and we are
[1:24:41] prisoners to what yesterday was
[1:24:44] like but if you could only see yourself
[1:24:47] as God sees
[1:24:51] you and you could get a glimpse that God
[1:24:54] never sees you now the way that you used
[1:24:57] to
[1:25:00] be but maybe there's a spirit Waring in
[1:25:03] your flesh of what you used to be and
[1:25:05] used to be why not tonight get a Divine
[1:25:07] Healing for that as
[1:25:14] well brother Brandon would talk about in
[1:25:18] spiritual
[1:25:21] Amnesia if you can just give me just a
[1:25:23] few moments
[1:25:25] in spiritual Amnesia he would talk about
[1:25:27] there was a there was some War boys
[1:25:31] soldiers and they'd been at
[1:25:34] War and as they had been at War they had
[1:25:37] forgot who they
[1:25:39] were he said kind of getting between two
[1:25:42] opinions will cause that they had forgot
[1:25:45] who they were and they were scarred and
[1:25:48] they didn't know where home was they'd
[1:25:51] put him on a train and take him to a
[1:25:53] place to where that they would be taken
[1:25:55] care of be cared for by tender
[1:25:59] hands but brother brand we'll talk about
[1:26:01] a story to where that this train would
[1:26:04] come to a stop and and they would let
[1:26:06] them get off and stretch their legs just
[1:26:08] a little
[1:26:09] bit and as they would get off and
[1:26:11] stretch their legs the story of the day
[1:26:14] was that there was one boy that that was
[1:26:17] looking
[1:26:18] around and as he was looking around
[1:26:20] there was a water tower
[1:26:25] and it seemed familiar to
[1:26:28] him and he and he just started
[1:26:32] walking and the guard instead of
[1:26:34] stopping him said I I think I'll follow
[1:26:37] him and he began to follow him and and
[1:26:41] as he was walking he noticed that he
[1:26:43] went up over the hill and went down and
[1:26:46] went up over another Hill and he was
[1:26:47] following a path and we go over the hill
[1:26:51] a couple of different places and he
[1:26:53] would look look and there was a little
[1:26:55] smoke coming from a a chimney there's a
[1:26:57] little house over there and he began to
[1:27:00] walk down and he as he walked down there
[1:27:02] was a man standing in the yard at the
[1:27:06] gate and the guard witnessed a
[1:27:12] miracle and that father was standing
[1:27:15] there and he said son I thought you was
[1:27:20] dead I thought you was dead welcome home
[1:27:28] welcome
[1:27:30] home or if we could see the water tower
[1:27:35] tonight I'm sorry that some have been
[1:27:38] scarred in so many directions and got
[1:27:41] different thoughts about different
[1:27:42] things
[1:27:44] and sometimes us as ministers may seem
[1:27:47] like that we were extending Grace like
[1:27:49] never before but you don't
[1:27:51] realize when we when we see that there's
[1:27:54] a seat of God on the inside of an
[1:27:58] individual we'll go to the ends of the
[1:28:03] Earth a real man of God will never give
[1:28:06] up on
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:13] you why would brother brandham hunt with
[1:28:16] a man named Burke
[1:28:21] call he called him o lizard
[1:28:25] I wickedest man he ever met a
[1:28:29] prophet that is going to reveal the
[1:28:32] mysteries of the
[1:28:34] book that as a spokesman for this age
[1:28:38] even would be confused with God
[1:28:41] himself but God would allow him to have
[1:28:44] time with Bert
[1:28:46] call let me just say this you God will
[1:28:49] take time for
[1:28:51] you you say God don't care for me let me
[1:28:54] just say this to you God
[1:28:58] cares and as long as there's breath in
[1:29:01] your lungs he still
[1:29:04] cares brother Ron I'm going to need a
[1:29:07] quote for that okay Jesus talked about a
[1:29:10] a a boy in a hog
[1:29:13] pin and you know he was talking to
[1:29:16] people that didn't identified with
[1:29:19] Hogs they were so religious and they
[1:29:22] were had a law
[1:29:24] and they'd put you in hell in a
[1:29:26] moment but Jesus talks about a man that
[1:29:31] is wanted to have all of his father's
[1:29:34] goods and he spent it all on riotous
[1:29:37] living but notice the father didn't give
[1:29:39] up on
[1:29:42] him notice he didn't give up on
[1:29:45] him and that boy found himself when the
[1:29:48] friends were gone found himself in a hog
[1:29:52] pin in a horrible Place one day he
[1:29:56] realized that my father's
[1:29:59] servants have it better than what I have
[1:30:03] something inside of him said it's time
[1:30:05] to go
[1:30:07] home now no man can come to the father
[1:30:10] except the father draws him there's no
[1:30:13] man can come but let me just say this
[1:30:16] you I dare not want to stand in one's
[1:30:21] way when he's on his way home
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:26] home brother Ron why are you going in
[1:30:29] this direction my boss told me to go in
[1:30:31] this
[1:30:33] direction he's interested in that last
[1:30:36] seed I don't know where it'll be sitting
[1:30:38] but he's interested in that last seed
[1:30:41] and none of us are going anywhere until
[1:30:43] that last one comes in
[1:30:54] when that boy made his way
[1:30:56] home he found a father that didn't
[1:30:59] condemn
[1:31:01] him he found a
[1:31:04] father that loved him as much as he ever
[1:31:07] loved
[1:31:08] him I would say this to you I've
[1:31:11] disappointed the Lord many
[1:31:13] times but he's never throwed me
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:20] away now for those that are
[1:31:22] self-righteous you you've disappointed
[1:31:24] him
[1:31:26] too maybe with an attitude or a thought
[1:31:29] out of place even toward one
[1:31:32] another Satan if he can't get you he'll
[1:31:35] get you to throw rocks at one another
[1:31:38] we're
[1:31:41] family I want to remind you under this
[1:31:44] Divine Healing we're all going to sit at
[1:31:46] the same
[1:31:50] table and it won't matter who can quote
[1:31:52] the most or who has the greatest
[1:31:55] Revelation or who is the most
[1:31:57] intellectual or who is the most anointed
[1:32:00] we've all got a seat at the
[1:32:02] table and I'm going to thank God that
[1:32:04] day that I made
[1:32:07] it Hallelujah I was not worthy but God
[1:32:12] in his
[1:32:13] [Applause]
[1:32:19] blood oh
[1:32:21] hallelujah oh Hallelujah
[1:32:25] now we realize that sickness comes not
[1:32:27] from
[1:32:30] God it comes from an
[1:32:32] enemy it's under the law of sin and
[1:32:35] death but we realize that we have power
[1:32:38] to
[1:32:39] pray brother Brenham tells us that
[1:32:42] prayer is the
[1:32:43] key it's the answer Prayer Changes
[1:32:47] Things prayer is the most powerful
[1:32:49] weapon that was ever put in control of
[1:32:51] human beings there's no atom IC
[1:32:56] bomb no hydrogen
[1:32:58] bomb as powerful as
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:07] prayer it's still active today Isaiah 53
[1:33:11] and verse 5 said but he was
[1:33:14] wounded for our
[1:33:17] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:33:22] iniquities the Chas but of our peace was
[1:33:25] upon him and with his
[1:33:33] stripes we are
[1:33:36] healed if Satan you know he thinks he's
[1:33:39] so
[1:33:41] smart but if it would only realize that
[1:33:45] when this man takes this
[1:33:48] beaten it's going to be the
[1:33:51] inoculation sickness cure
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:58] Hallelujah if he's so smart with the
[1:34:00] word of God he would have never touch
[1:34:03] Jesus Jesus would have died an old
[1:34:08] man so the devil's not so
[1:34:12] smart and he'll afflict a child of God
[1:34:16] knowing that they have a right yeah and
[1:34:19] there's a blood and there's a scripture
[1:34:22] that said I don't have to to live this
[1:34:24] way I can be
[1:34:28] healed he cared enough he cared enough
[1:34:31] to conquer every enemy for
[1:34:35] you that all you have to do is to be
[1:34:38] sincere and believe it he conquered
[1:34:41] death and death ain't nothing for me to
[1:34:43] conquer it's already conquered sickness
[1:34:46] ain't for me to conquer it can't it it
[1:34:48] ain't nothing he said for Christ to
[1:34:50] conquer it's already conquered I just
[1:34:53] have to care enough to believe it are
[1:34:56] you afraid what somebody else Will has
[1:34:59] told you are you afraid of a doctor's
[1:35:01] diagnosis are you afraid of what the
[1:35:03] church will say to you are you afraid to
[1:35:06] stand there toe-to-toe with the devil
[1:35:09] and say I've confessed my sins I've laid
[1:35:11] aside everything and I believe in every
[1:35:13] word Here I Am Lord create in me you
[1:35:18] cared for me I care for you
[1:35:24] and now we are more than
[1:35:27] conquerors we just walk right into it as
[1:35:29] an inheritance more than conquerors
[1:35:32] we're dealing with a defeated
[1:35:36] enemy sickness is
[1:35:39] defeated death is
[1:35:42] defeated hell is
[1:35:44] defeated everything is
[1:35:48] defeated brother said I wish I was twice
[1:35:51] as size I am now
[1:35:55] we are
[1:35:56] disputing yeah he's twice my size we are
[1:36:00] disputing with
[1:36:03] a a conquered
[1:36:05] enemy could you say that with me we are
[1:36:08] disputing with a conquered
[1:36:11] enemy Give the Lord a good hand
[1:36:26] now once we're healed once God blesses
[1:36:30] us we have an obligation to thank him
[1:36:33] for
[1:36:34] it you know that's the reason that we
[1:36:36] come to church and we have song Services
[1:36:39] it's to bring us out of the atmosphere
[1:36:41] of the world and you know and we're not
[1:36:44] here to be entertained we're we're here
[1:36:46] to lift our worship before the
[1:36:49] Lord now whether you're a quiet person
[1:36:52] or the loudest person in the building we
[1:36:54] all have an obligation to enter into
[1:36:58] worship now entering into worship is not
[1:37:02] just for the men of God to to preach to
[1:37:05] you but then you respond to it and when
[1:37:08] you respond you're not just responding
[1:37:11] you know for even for yourself to hear
[1:37:13] it but you're responding to where that
[1:37:16] your enemy hears it and you identify
[1:37:19] with what the word
[1:37:22] says
[1:37:24] am oh but I think it but God didn't ask
[1:37:27] you to think it he asked you to confess
[1:37:31] it so worship is a part of confessing
[1:37:36] it and if you remember God gave people
[1:37:40] talents and he gave them gifts and he
[1:37:42] gave them healings and and one time
[1:37:44] there was many that went away but two
[1:37:46] came back to praise him and thank him
[1:37:48] for it I would like to be a part of
[1:37:50] those that came back to say thank you
[1:37:55] I'm in a situation of my life I thank
[1:37:57] him for every
[1:37:58] day I thank him for every hour I don't
[1:38:01] just take it for granted I I very much
[1:38:03] thank him I have found out what's really
[1:38:06] important to
[1:38:08] me amen
[1:38:10] amen and Psalms 150 is a good spot to
[1:38:14] stop and
[1:38:17] thinking praise ye the
[1:38:21] Lord hallah Praise God in his
[1:38:25] Sanctuary Praise Him in the firment of
[1:38:27] his
[1:38:28] power praise him for his mighty
[1:38:31] acts Praise Him according to his
[1:38:34] excellent
[1:38:35] greatness that's for his works praise
[1:38:38] him for his works praise him for his
[1:38:40] healings praise him for the gifts in the
[1:38:43] body praise him for what he has done for
[1:38:45] you you're not a here by an accident
[1:38:48] praise him for that
[1:38:53] don't take for sitting in this building
[1:38:55] for granted Satan's done everything that
[1:38:58] he can to stop you from being setting
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:02] here oh
[1:39:06] hallelujah praise him with the sound of
[1:39:08] a trumpet praise him with a saucery and
[1:39:11] a harp doesn't sound like a quiet place
[1:39:13] praise him with a timble and a dance
[1:39:16] praise him with stringed instruments and
[1:39:20] organs praise him with loud sounding
[1:39:22] symbol
[1:39:24] praise him on the high sounding
[1:39:29] symbols let everything that hath
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:45] breath let everything that half breath
[1:39:48] praise ye the Lord
[1:39:59] [Applause]
[1:40:14] Hallelujah brother Ron you're going to
[1:40:16] make us Pentecostal
[1:40:19] exactly the original ones
[1:40:23] but brother Ron I I came out of a dead
[1:40:26] Church well there's a healing line for
[1:40:30] that yes
[1:40:32] sir there's a healing line for that
[1:40:35] there's a blood for that brother Ron but
[1:40:38] my church don't do that you might want
[1:40:40] to
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:47] move why should we be scared of
[1:40:50] worshiping the Lord
[1:40:54] they worship at a hockey game they
[1:40:56] worship at a football game they
[1:40:59] worship
[1:41:01] Hall they worship why shouldn't we
[1:41:04] worship the King of Kings and the Lord
[1:41:06] of lords for he is good and his mercies
[1:41:10] endure
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:21] forever we ought to thank God I'm free
[1:41:24] I'm free I'm
[1:41:26] free I've been born
[1:41:30] [Applause]
[1:41:32] again now I would say this to you if if
[1:41:36] you're
[1:41:38] dead you have a right to set dead
[1:41:43] still but I will identify somebody
[1:41:45] that's dead still and quiet and don't
[1:41:47] want nothing to do with worship they're
[1:41:50] spiritually dead but you don't have to
[1:41:53] stay that
[1:41:56] way there's a better
[1:42:01] life it's kind of like being married you
[1:42:04] should tell your wife she's the most
[1:42:06] beautiful woman in the
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:11] world you better tell her she's the most
[1:42:13] beautiful woman in the world you tell
[1:42:15] her how much you love her every day
[1:42:18] multiple
[1:42:19] times brother Ron I'm just not that kind
[1:42:22] of person you need to you need
[1:42:24] [Applause]
[1:42:32] Jesus cuz marriage besides the Lord is
[1:42:35] the greatest thing that God did for you
[1:42:38] you're going to spend eternity with that
[1:42:40] little woman you stepped out of time
[1:42:43] into
[1:42:44] eternity you say where does this fit in
[1:42:46] a healing line some of your marriages

[1:44:27] it we need to care for them and do it we
[1:44:31] need to live like
[1:44:40] Jesus sometimes we think well why am I
[1:44:43] having so much
[1:44:44] trouble brother brandham says and why
[1:44:47] does God let troubles
[1:44:49] come but he said he God harnesses
[1:44:52] trouble and puts bit in its mouths and
[1:44:54] makes it obey him and it's those
[1:44:57] troubles that bring us into closer
[1:44:58] fellowship with
[1:45:00] God a Sayan that struck home with me the
[1:45:03] other day said I asked God why are you
[1:45:05] taking me through trouble
[1:45:08] water and he replied to me it's because
[1:45:12] your enemies can't swim
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:27] brother BR said it's in those crucial
[1:45:29] hours that press us onto those sacred
[1:45:32] Sands it was in the Bible and and now
[1:45:35] and remember no matter how great the
[1:45:37] distress is Satan cannot take your life
[1:45:41] until God is finished with you I want
[1:45:43] you to say this with me Satan cannot
[1:45:46] take your life until God is finished
[1:45:49] with you so why should we fear death
[1:45:57] there is nothing that can happen to you
[1:45:59] unless God permits it there's no evil
[1:46:02] can come unless God permits
[1:46:05] it notice these next word and it's for
[1:46:09] your
[1:46:12] good he's working
[1:46:16] that brother sister now let us turn our
[1:46:18] camera and turn it back to that dark
[1:46:21] afternoon 1900 years years ago this
[1:46:23] afternoon looking going up a hill I hear
[1:46:26] thumping what is it it's an Old Rugged
[1:46:28] Cross going up the hillside it's
[1:46:30] dragging out those bloody Footprints of
[1:46:33] the bear and as it's bumping over those
[1:46:36] rocks as it went through the street I
[1:46:39] look over all of his back and its specks
[1:46:41] all over and that robe is without seam
[1:46:44] and and God of creation packing the very
[1:46:46] cross that he created Emmanuel's blood
[1:46:49] begins to flow through his back and
[1:46:51] spots and and as he goes up the hill
[1:46:54] them stop them spots be begin to get
[1:46:57] bigger and bigger and all at once they
[1:46:59] go into one great big splotch of
[1:47:03] blood and against his little humble body
[1:47:06] weakly legs they begin to Splat what is
[1:47:09] it is his dropping it he's dropped his
[1:47:12] shoulder his human strength what was it
[1:47:15] God hiding himself in
[1:47:19] Simplicity that was God packing that
[1:47:22] cross
[1:47:24] here he goes up the hill stumbling the
[1:47:27] blood running out out of him he fell
[1:47:30] Simon picked up that cross to help him
[1:47:33] with it and as he goes up the hill the
[1:47:35] devil said you know what I I know that
[1:47:40] he's not God I know he's not he would
[1:47:43] never do that I've got him now I've
[1:47:45] conquered every man I've got him so I
[1:47:48] know that that ain't God
[1:47:53] so he sent the bee of death to sting him
[1:47:56] and as that bee begin to H around him
[1:47:59] you know bees insects that have stingers
[1:48:02] death's in the stinger and you know a an
[1:48:05] insect ever ever stings death it begins
[1:48:09] to pull that stinger out so it is ever
[1:48:14] anchored in a man an ordinary man if
[1:48:17] he's been an ordinary man a prophet he's
[1:48:20] he's had that
[1:48:21] stung and many a prophet has died but
[1:48:25] when he stung this
[1:48:30] one when he sunk his
[1:48:33] Stinger into the Lamb of
[1:48:37] God he no longer had the sting of
[1:48:41] death he pulled it inside him himself
[1:48:44] for
[1:48:45] you if you would have been the only one
[1:48:48] he pulled it inside of himself for you
[1:48:54] yeah now you remember in Jonesboro

[2:00:09] disease had set in and now she's losing
[2:00:11] all of her hair it was in that prayer
[2:00:13] line that she
[2:00:15] came and she brought three bobby
[2:00:19] pins and she said I believe that I can
[2:00:22] wear these I'll be needing
[2:00:24] these God came and touched her life if
[2:00:28] you could see her today many of you seen
[2:00:30] the pictures of her heard her testimony

[2:00:40] hair it was in that meeting that at the
[2:00:44] end I would be carried to a
[2:00:46] cabin but just before I was carried to a
[2:00:48] cabin the Lord whispered in my ear wait
[2:00:51] for Jessica wait for Jessica Martin you
[2:00:54] would know her as
[2:00:56] wendles he's
[2:01:02] here wait for Jessica Martin and I
[2:01:06] waited for just almost hundreds of
[2:01:08] people and finally Jessica stepped I
[2:01:10] didn't know her need but he
[2:01:13] did you've heard the story of how he WR
[2:01:17] and all of us appreciate that story
[2:01:23] but she had a boy in
[2:01:24] trouble in a lot of trouble I'm not so
[2:01:28] worried about your past I'm worried
[2:01:30] about your
[2:01:32] [Applause]
[2:01:34] future and the Lord spoke to her you was
[2:01:37] in a vessel and said I give you your
[2:01:42] son I give you your son and today her
[2:01:47] son is saved and is
[2:01:50] married and is a pillar in the
[2:02:04] church immediately after that they would
[2:02:06] carry me off to a
[2:02:08] cabin this story may have you have heard
[2:02:11] but it's still
[2:02:13] true you don't have to embellish the
[2:02:18] truth brother Tim PR's son-in-law
[2:02:22] Aaron ausby was not a
[2:02:24] preacher at least he didn't know
[2:02:27] it and he carries me in he's a height of
[2:02:30] this fell here and he carries me
[2:02:34] in and as he's carrying me in I said
[2:02:37] you'll never be the
[2:02:39] same God's calling you to preach the
[2:02:43] gospel and he flung up against the wall
[2:02:45] and God came down and filled his life
[2:02:48] like never
[2:02:50] before and let me me to say he's not
[2:02:52] just a preacher he is a convention
[2:02:57] preacher when God does a job he does it
[2:03:00] extremely
[2:03:03] well and I sat down spinning in the Holy
[2:03:06] Spirit and I saw a vision of a little
[2:03:08] boy coming across the yard in a Mickey
[2:03:11] Mouse shirt with his finger up like
[2:03:15] that and Andrew was standing in front of
[2:03:17] me and I said I see a little boy a boy
[2:03:20] of impossibility and Andrew immediately
[2:03:22] responded not me daddyy not me
[2:03:26] Daddy I said
[2:03:28] no it'll be Whitney and Davey now
[2:03:32] Whitney was born with a condition to
[2:03:33] where that she was impossible to have a
[2:03:35] children and she married knowing that
[2:03:38] they couldn't have children but God
[2:03:40] thinks something
[2:03:42] greater Davy was in an accident that
[2:03:45] story was told it was believed that that
[2:03:47] story now was about 3 years old and
[2:03:50] God's not in really Hur
[2:03:53] and so
[2:03:54] anyway as as as time would go Davy was
[2:03:58] in an accident hit ice and flipped him
[2:04:00] up in a tree and crushed his pelvis that
[2:04:04] pelvis was so crushed until I heard the
[2:04:06] doctor say you'll never have children
[2:04:09] because it's crushed all of that part
[2:04:12] the vision still
[2:04:14] holds I'm going to talk to you about
[2:04:16] some impossible situations
[2:04:20] now they came came through the prayer
[2:04:22] line about a year
[2:04:24] later and the angel of the Lord was
[2:04:27] there I said Whitney being my daughter I
[2:04:31] said Whitney it's time for that
[2:04:36] baby now let me just say this to you I
[2:04:39] had never uttered these
[2:04:43] words but God not only showed me was a
[2:04:46] boy he not only showed me his eye color
[2:04:49] and his hair color
[2:04:54] but he told me his
[2:04:56] name now that's not too hard for God
[2:04:58] because it comes out of the
[2:05:02] book don't take that so strange it comes
[2:05:04] out of the
[2:05:06] book and so when I walked into the the
[2:05:09] room that day they said we'd like to
[2:05:11] tell you his name I said let me tell you
[2:05:13] his
[2:05:15] name his name is a Isaac Jackson Braden
[2:05:19] that's exactly right brother Ron
[2:05:22] I said that's what the Lord said it
[2:05:24] would
[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:41] be I had a nephew that
[2:05:45] was that was so
[2:05:49] lost it seemed like no hope
[2:05:53] he had had Promises of playing
[2:05:55] professional football in America that's
[2:05:56] a great big
[2:05:58] deal but he had promises to playing
[2:06:01] professional
[2:06:03] football he was now living in a Dusty
[2:06:06] Rusty basement musty and you could smell
[2:06:10] it on his
[2:06:12] clothes he was living a very wretched
[2:06:17] life I was getting ready to have brain
[2:06:19] surgery
[2:06:23] and he came and he sat at the side of my
[2:06:25] bed and he just sat there that day
[2:06:28] before Co everybody could
[2:06:30] come and they wasn't thinking maybe even
[2:06:33] I would live through it so they let
[2:06:34] everybody in and
[2:06:36] so you know everybody was there maybe 30
[2:06:40] to 50 people was in the room it was
[2:06:43] eating Mexican food I couldn't eat they
[2:06:47] was eating Mexican food somebody said
[2:06:49] amen
[2:06:54] they was wrapping it in those things you
[2:06:56] know and they were enjoying it you know
[2:06:58] and all of a sudden that room became
[2:07:00] empty it was just me and
[2:07:03] him I looked over at him and I said
[2:07:06] Gabriel I don't believe that what's just
[2:07:08] happened is by accident everybody left
[2:07:11] but
[2:07:12] you I said you see I'm not the greatest
[2:07:15] need in the room
[2:07:22] I said what you need Gabriel's
[2:07:25] Jesus it don't take 10 years 15 years to
[2:07:29] grow your way into
[2:07:33] it so in just a few moments I begin to
[2:07:36] speak to him and Jesus came in the
[2:07:41] room and in a few moments he walked back
[2:07:44] into that they walked back into that
[2:07:46] room and I said I have an announcement

[2:09:03] it cuz I don't want you to look at me I

[2:09:21] [Applause]
[2:09:26] I'd been invited with brother Tim PR and
[2:09:28] brother Timothy PR brother Jason Jackson
[2:09:31] to preach a meeting at brother Danny
[2:09:33] steeman
[2:09:34] church it was the last morning that we
[2:09:36] were going to be
[2:09:39] there and I had a vision I had a vision
[2:09:42] that I was entering a pit and it was the
[2:09:46] most horrible pit of my
[2:09:47] life and in this depth of this pit I'd
[2:09:50] never seen I'd never seen the Calamity
[2:09:53] or the chaos that would be in this
[2:09:55] Darkness it was so thick it was so
[2:09:58] oppressing it was so depressing there's
[2:10:00] not enough words that I could say to
[2:10:02] it but at the bottom of the
[2:10:06] pit I found a
[2:10:14] niece she was a girl that had left her
[2:10:18] husband and she had entered a wretched
[2:10:20] life
[2:10:22] everybody said a lot of things against
[2:10:24] you not
[2:10:30] me I'm careful how I talk about those
[2:10:34] things I didn't throw any
[2:10:37] Stones cuz I know what Jesus can
[2:10:45] do Facebook said a lot of things
[2:10:49] Instagram said a lot of things a lot of
[2:10:52] people gave up a lot of people stowed
[2:10:54] stones but I had a
[2:10:57] vision and at the bottom of the pit I
[2:11:01] asked her I said are you ready to go
[2:11:04] home yes I am and I took her by the arm
[2:11:08] and we begin to walk out of that
[2:11:16] pit do you know that L that girl sits in
[2:11:18] our church now
[2:11:22] a girl of Grace a girl of
[2:11:26] Mercy a girl that has been
[2:11:28] restored a girl back with her
[2:11:43] husband I was called one night to
[2:11:46] a the bedside of a girl that would had
[2:11:49] hated me and said said a lot of bad
[2:11:51] things about
[2:11:53] me they give her hours to live she
[2:11:56] weighed 85 lbs and she was green she was
[2:11:59] green as some of your
[2:12:02] clothes the nurse was sitting at watch
[2:12:05] and her daughters was there her husband
[2:12:08] was sitting beside of her and when I
[2:12:10] walked in it was late at night the Lord
[2:12:12] had spoke to me go to her
[2:12:15] side so I figured if the Lord had spoke
[2:12:18] to me to go he had business to attend
[2:12:25] to now I'll tell you the reason why I'm
[2:12:33] here I'm probably the sickest man in the
[2:12:37] room but I'm here under commission to
[2:12:39] help
[2:12:45] you and I'm going be straight up with
[2:12:47] the devil right
[2:12:49] now honest to God facts with with papers
[2:12:53] that tall I'm probably the sickest man
[2:12:55] in this room but I'm not afraid of the
[2:13:00] sickness I may be afflicted but I'm not
[2:13:13] defeated I don't need notches on my belt
[2:13:16] I don't need nobody to praise me but I'm
[2:13:18] here because God sent me this year
[2:13:20] especially
[2:13:22] and put an incredible burden on for me
[2:13:23] to be here and while I was expressing my
[2:13:26] burden brother Ed immediately wrote me
[2:13:30] and told me he wanted me to
[2:13:34] come God answers on both ends of the
[2:13:37] line he don't pull a meeting together
[2:13:40] just to see if he pulls a meeting
[2:13:42] together he gathered his
[2:13:45] people he knows your
[2:13:48] condition he's come to your bed side
[2:13:51] right now he knows what's going on in
[2:13:54] your life whether you're in the seen
[2:13:56] audience or the Unseen
[2:14:03] audience I told her husband he was
[2:14:05] telling me I'd like for you to preach
[2:14:07] the funeral I'd like for you to you know
[2:14:10] get us through this tragic event and I
[2:14:12] said you know I don't think that the
[2:14:14] Lord sent me here to get funeral
[2:14:19] preparations she'd been out of her for
[2:14:21] maybe days weeks and hadn't said or
[2:14:24] uttered a word and I took her by her
[2:14:26] little head and I rolled it over to me
[2:14:29] and her eyes that hadn't been open for
[2:14:31] for now days rolled up and looked right
[2:14:33] in my eyes and I said
[2:14:39] Tabatha you may have hated me for a long
[2:14:42] time you may have said a lot of things
[2:14:44] and you may have been not understanding
[2:14:46] of
[2:14:47] me you may not have loved me but I'm
[2:14:50] here for you
[2:14:52] I want to tell you I haven't come to
[2:14:54] preach your funeral I've come to tell
[2:14:56] you that there's a Jesus that can heal
[2:14:58] you and I begin to pray for that girl
[2:15:02] and as I prayed I felt the presence of
[2:15:04] God drop in the
[2:15:07] room I turned to her husband in that
[2:15:10] impossible situation and I said she'll
[2:15:12] walk down the hall with you tomorrow
[2:15:16] [Music]
[2:15:21] don't look at what you're
[2:15:24] seeing don't look at your impossible
[2:15:28] situation don't look at it don't keep
[2:15:30] your eyes on that you focus on
[2:15:34] Jesus you just walk into the vision you
[2:15:37] walk into a well body you begin to take
[2:15:41] steps you can't do nothing but move your
[2:15:44] finger move your
[2:15:47] fer start thanking God for your healing
[2:15:58] the next day she rolled out of that bed
[2:16:00] and walked down that
[2:16:02] hallway the nurse told me on the way out
[2:16:05] she said I don't I don't believe you
[2:16:07] understand I don't believe you gave them
[2:16:09] a false hope and I said I didn't say it
[2:16:11] Jesus said it
[2:16:28] you said well brother Ron
[2:16:31] I I believe I can get my healing while
[2:16:35] the word Goes Forth I believe that
[2:16:39] too I was preaching at a huge
[2:16:44] meeting this is a large congregation but
[2:16:47] that audience is about three or four
[2:16:48] times his size
[2:16:51] as I preached there was an older man
[2:16:53] with with braces on his legs and
[2:16:56] crutches to this day I don't know he's
[2:16:59] name but he began to walk as I preached
[2:17:03] and he moved about like this right
[2:17:06] here as he walked he was making his way
[2:17:09] past tent poles as as he was making his
[2:17:13] way past one tent to pole he would take
[2:17:15] a break for a little while and makeing
[2:17:18] making a little bit further and he would
[2:17:19] take a break for a little while he make
[2:17:21] a little bit further and he got to the
[2:17:23] front of the
[2:17:24] place and when he got to the front of
[2:17:26] the place he throw his crutches down he
[2:17:28] thought his braces off he ran all over
[2:17:31] that
[2:17:37] place this okay this
[2:17:42] okay I was overseas so I wouldn't know
[2:17:45] anybody this lady was sitting there
[2:17:47] about where you're sitting and she was
[2:17:49] sitting there and I just kept getting
[2:17:50] get draw to her I said I believe if
[2:17:53] you'll stand to your feet you have
[2:17:54] pancreas cancer and they've only gave
[2:17:56] you weeks to live she said that's right
[2:17:58] brother Ron I said Jesus is your healer
[2:18:01] she's still alive
[2:18:09] today there's nothing impossible with
[2:18:13] God lady told me she said Tuesday I'm
[2:18:16] going to deliver a dead baby I said let
[2:18:19] God breathe life in to that womb just
[2:18:21] now I prayed for her and a healthy boy
[2:18:24] was born out of that dead
[2:18:33] womb so don't tell me God can't still
[2:18:36] work he's not
[2:18:39] dead that didn't leave the earth when a
[2:18:41] prophet left the Earth We're still
[2:18:44] commissioned to lay hands on the sick
[2:18:47] and they shall recover
[2:18:53] let's remind him of the prophet's prayer
[2:18:55] Satan I JW you in the name of the Lord
[2:18:57] Jesus Christ leave this
[2:19:00] person leave this person Satan you're
[2:19:04] defeated in the name of Jesus Christ you
[2:19:07] were whipped at Calvary you don't have
[2:19:09] arrows for your own bow you have no
[2:19:12] legal
[2:19:16] Authority it's for you if you will
[2:19:19] believe
[2:19:30] brother Ron I've I've gotten a little
[2:19:31] bitter in my
[2:19:33] spirit I'm coming to a close I've gotten
[2:19:36] a little bitter in my spirit my prayer
[2:19:40] life is
[2:19:41] left and I've got
[2:19:43] critical everpresent water from the
[2:19:47] Rocks brother Bram explains that he said
[2:19:51] it once was a beautiful
[2:19:54] flower but Without
[2:19:57] Rain Without
[2:19:59] Rain it'll begin to curl up and it'll
[2:20:01] get become a sticker and then it's just
[2:20:04] constantly punching at
[2:20:07] everything if you're not careful you'll
[2:20:09] get a critical spirit and nothing's
[2:20:11] right in
[2:20:14] church songs this music the heat in the
[2:20:17] a fans blowing over your head who said
[2:20:21] in your Pew preachers too

[2:20:43] longer you just need an attitude change
[2:20:46] in your
[2:20:48] life maybe you don't understand the road
[2:20:51] that your pastor's taken taking through
[2:20:53] a journey but God shows him a certain
[2:20:56] way to
[2:20:57] operate and it's that Pastor many times
[2:21:00] he'll go directions that'll disappoint
[2:21:02] you but God's Got A
[2:21:09] Plan God's Got A Plan he'll leave 90 and
[2:21:12] n and go get

[2:22:32] so critical would we have been Critical
[2:22:35] with brother brandom dancing around a
[2:22:38] tree would we have been a critical of

[2:22:46] end of this service with brother
[2:22:47] brandham walking across the pull pit

[5:01:50] happen here the devil started a long
[5:01:53] time ago but at the same time God
[5:01:55] started moving a long time ago and there
[5:01:58] was a showdown and the devil was cast
[5:02:01] out the devil was put to shame we're
[5:02:04] taking a step higher

[5:02:29] next week next month it'll keep
[5:02:33] going how many want to say I'm not going
[5:02:36] out of here the same I'm going to be
[5:02:38] different
[5:02:40] not because of what I did but because of
[5:02:42] what he did oh
[5:02:45] my didn't the Lord meet
[5:02:48] [Music]
[5:02:50] us oh my I I I I couldn't ever be what
[5:02:55] jeul forn is he'd sing wasn't at a time
[5:02:58] but I could never do that I think we
[5:03:01] ought to sing what a mighty God we serve
[5:03:04] and we do
[5:03:06] that oh what a mighty God we
[5:03:12] serve one mighty God we
[5:03:18] serve Angels bow before him Heaven and
[5:03:22] Earth adore him what mighty God we
[5:03:29] serve Jesus is the God we
[5:03:35] serve Jesus is the God we serve
[5:03:41] Angels bow before him and Heaven and
[5:03:45] Earth adore him
[5:03:47] that's God we serve What a Mighty God oh
[5:03:52] what a mighty God we
[5:03:56] [Music]

[5:04:02] serve Angels bow before him Heaven and
[5:04:07] Earth adore him
[5:04:10] mighty God we
[5:04:15] serve
[5:04:18] Hallelujah we could go on singing but
[5:04:20] I'm looking at the clock and it's just
[5:04:22] about 11: and we need to get back here
[5:04:24] at 10:00 and we need to get if if some
[5:04:28] of us need to get to bed at least some
[5:04:29] of these preachers need to get to bed
[5:04:31] and restore their
[5:04:32] [Music]
[5:04:34] strength brother Nathan says no problem
[5:04:36] I can handle it
[5:04:39] oh
[5:04:42] my I
[5:04:46] believe for some of what we saw this is
[5:04:48] what we prayed
[5:04:50] for I believe this is what brother Ron
[5:04:53] came
[5:04:53] for I believe this is what Brother Ray
[5:04:56] came
[5:04:57] for I believe this is what heaven called
[5:05:00] us here
[5:05:04] [Music]
[5:05:08] for I don't know what we
[5:05:12] [Music]
[5:05:18] can there's more that's going to come I
[5:05:21] don't believe it's
[5:05:22] [Music]
[5:05:24] finished I believe that God has taken us
[5:05:26] into another
[5:05:28] level we we saw it brother
[5:05:32] Ron I think you're even beginning to
[5:05:36] find out the depth of what God spoke to
[5:05:40] you and I'm watching
[5:05:43] it and here's a man who is strung out to
[5:05:47] the very
[5:05:48] end but God is using him like never
[5:05:52] before now this isn't just about brother
[5:05:55] Ron but this is about all of us because
[5:05:59] we all have trials and we all have
[5:06:03] issues but we're Rising above those
[5:06:06] things I believe God's given us new
[5:06:09] faith Faith new courage new strength and
[5:06:13] I want to keep walking with him I don't
[5:06:16] know what it was like for those Hebrew
