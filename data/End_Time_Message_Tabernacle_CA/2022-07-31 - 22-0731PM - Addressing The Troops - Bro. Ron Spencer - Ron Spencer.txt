before you when you come up just wait because brother ed's gonna take the offering at that point and then sing and after that will be the sunday school children so if all the sunday school children while the specials are taking place go meet out in the back room so you can get organized a little bit better all right so if we can do that that would be great um let's sing almost home almost home i've got a mansion waiting and i'm almost home they took the apostle peter out beat him all because he would not deny the lord as he had done before they hug him by his feet to die they thought he was alone but [Music] waiting [Applause] [Music] i've got a mansion waiting anytime [Music] [Applause] [Music] but he had a great connection with the lord up in the sky he saw the new jerusalem they thought he was alone he said it's not so hard to die when you can't see your hopes i'm almost [Music] i'm almost [Music] the holy ghost also he would not deny the lord his time had come to go thank you man they stoned him when his life was almost gone he looked up to heaven and said i'm almost oh [Music] almost home [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] you can call me crazy [Music] even say i'm a fool i know it's not easy sometimes seems so cruel but i remember where i came from [Music] [Music] you've had your chance to make something [Music] out of my life [Music] me now i'm giving to jesus for the time of my life [Music] through [Music] [Laughter] [Music] now you may be feeling [Music] oh so you sat in blue [Music] and you may not be knowing [Music] exactly what to do won't you turn to my jesus cause he'll make you brand new [Music] when you tell him tell the devil we're through [Music] out of my life [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm giving to

you tonight it's a grand privilege to be here and i've really been enjoying every last minute of it and so i'm going to sing a song for you guys tonight and it's an older song i'm sure you all know it but the song is about freedom so i like it and by the way you guys are worshiping i hear free people here today so we'll sing this song for you tonight and hope you enjoy lock me up in and throw away the keys [Music] take away my vision from these eyes [Music] then deprive me of the [Music] [Applause] and feet [Music] then i can still go free oh he said that i could still go free tell me what kind of a man would reach down his head and do this for me for you and me so i'm worthy [Music] had me will and he said that i could still go free now i need could quite understand why a king would leave his throne to dawn the road of an [Music] earthly man [Music] that led to calvary [Music] where those blood red stings broke all since chains now i can still go free he said that i could still go tell me what kind of a man would reach down his hair and do this me [Music] [Applause] for you and me so unworthy to live [Music] his will he said that i could still go free let's sing it together once he said that i could still go free [Applause] oh tell me what kind of a man would reach down his head [Music] for you and me [Music] put me in his will and he said that i could still go [Music] amen hallelujah thank you jesus sister elise if you would come up let's just sing that chorus i claim the blood that jesus shed and calvary will sing that course after our sister is done singing that song we'll have the young people come up and sing but right at that point when she's done can the little children go to the back for you at that point i claim the blood [Music] on top for free those precious [Music] my sickness [Music] those precious blood stains amen you may be seated [Music] just before our sister sings we're going to take up an offering again tonight for the expenses of the meeting i believe you've seen these brothers pour out their hearts and their lives for what we are seeing god do in our midst and i want to just extend our appreciation not just in thanksgiving but i want to do it in deed so we want to give back we're going to have an offering to these brothers pick up some of the expenses so as the brothers come forward with the offering if they would please we just have a quick word of prayer and if you can give god bless you if you can't give god bless you and may god just return and multiply to you but we're just going to have the offering come forward brothers and uh we don't just done this twice so we we do that just to worship the lord let's just pray together heavenly father once again father with thankful hearts not out of constraint but with thankful hearts we give of ourselves to you we could never repay what you did for us at calvary but oh god we give that little this of our substance and we glorify the name of god bless each one that can give use the money oh lord that will help offset these meetings lord further the kingdom of god bless these brothers abundantly bless everyone that can give we thank you in jesus name amen [Music] god bless you all was just requested that i sing uh tonight i wonder if you have the words for garma to praise um the lord took me out of catholicism many years ago and i was baptized about 12 years ago in christian baptism i accepted the message and a few years ago i started praying for real experience with the holy ghost and i knew god was moving in my life but i knew something was missing and at our fall meetings brother timothy preached a message a new song to sing and that's where god used a man to speak to me and after that service i was in such a state of surrender in worship that he came down and touched me and after that i had that joy unspeakable and peace that passes all understanding and i know that's real because it's the word um so this song is basically taken from that sermon that that changed my life and also isaiah 61 and psalm 48 40. joining if you know it he said he would be even in you and give you the peace deep within then he placed you in laodicea darkest of days you are in there is sorrow hatred and envy evil spirits waging war it's singing a song but don't listen you don't sing that song anymore so put on a garment of praise get up and walk by faith your youth will be renewed you'll take a body change encourage yourself in the lord his word it is your sword oil of joy for morning and beautiful ashes your life is a song and it's no longer your own no there isn't a doubt let your life shout it out put on a comment of praise god chose you for this hour so you know you'll make it through don't put on a spirit of depression let his holy spirit fill you it will surely change your tune then you'll sing a different song and you might call me crazy but one day i'll be gone so put on that garment of praise get a by face your youth will be renewed you'll take a body change encourage yourself in the lord his word it is your sword all the joy for morning beautiful ashes your life is a song it's no longer your own no there isn't a doubt [Music] so put yourself in the word and remember david he was not discouraged when he encouraged himself in the lord on the worst day of their lives in a jail silas heard paul say you know what i feel like doing like praising him anyway so put on a garment of praise get up and walk by faith your youths will be renewed take a body change encourage yourself in the lord his word is yours joyful morning [Applause] ashes your life is a song it's no longer your own there isn't a doubt let your life shout it out put on a carving of praise no there isn't a doubt let your life shout it out put on a garment [Music] if the young people could come up right now and in the sunday school children right after we will remember we will remember we will remember the works of your hands we will stop and give you praise for great is thy faithfulness we will remember [Music] [Applause] [Music] we will give you gracefulness [Music] [Applause] [Music] you've been [Music] with signs and wonders you've shown your power with precious [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and give you praise [Music] [Applause] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] we will be i is remember the day you saved me the day i heard you call out my name you said you love me but never leave me we will remember we will remember we will stop and give you grace [Applause] [Music] and give tomorrow gracefulness we will stop and give you praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i was reading they were a man said the devil got before him and said he's just a little bitty old evil and he said boo said i'll jump back and said he said boo i jumped back every time he'd hollered boo and i'd jump back he'd get bigger and i'd get littler instead he kept saying boo said i'd get smaller each time i'm going to jump back and he'd get bigger so i know what i had to fight him after a while that i looked around but what i found the word of god said i wrote it in my hand and the devil said boo and i said boo back is that when i said boo back every time i said boo he got smaller i got bigger that's it you've got to fight him sooner or later [Music] the third verse of the song we are singing was written by a sister in our church for a tribute to brother ron spencer now the devil and his many sneaky ways [Music] he tries to sneak up on me each and every day but i have something over me he's afraid of i'm chilled with the word of god [Music] he says if i resist you you will have to leave [Music] jesus lives in me there's a battle on the hill called calvary and for a while satan had themselves had to be but he got the scare of his life you could not believe when jesus turned the gates of hell and took away his keys [Music] [Music] is now the devil here's tried to make me lame he's crippled this whole body and he's throwing me in the flame so this is just another chance to prevent his defeat see that then life can collect this is underneath my feet out of here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] he says [Music] christ lives in me he says [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right amen who got it [Music] yes thank you lord hallelujah hallelujah amen boo devil amen amen we'll sing one last song as brother ed takes the pulpit mercy walked in but i just want to say this is the the last service the culmination i know in the scripture it talks about in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink and mercy is here amen so just drink and drink and drink amen i stood in the core truth the judge turned let's all stand my way it looks like you're guilty [Music] i spoke up your honor i have no defense but that's when overseas [Music] [Applause] [Music] the blood was presented [Music] walking [Music] how could this be [Music] my chains they were broken [Music] again one day [Music] [Applause] [Music] forgiveness [Music] amen we did nothing to deserve it but he freely bestowed it upon us so good to be in church again tonight it's just a few hours ago we all left this building i think it was two o'clock somebody might say well brother tim was preaching i expected that i'd like to let you know something brother tim finished at one o'clock the holy spirit took the service for the last hour you can't blame you want to blame anybody you blame god and i don't think there's one of us that could say thank god that he took the service amen well i i sure want to just say i appreciate your brother tim thank you for pouring out your heart this morning [Music] brother timothy you're a credit to this gospel and we love you and appreciate you and we thank you for what you have labored and brought to us and the young people all said amen [Music] not just the young people the old people too and all that are in between i don't know have you have you shaken hands with somebody yet today you did okay why don't you high-five somebody this time then [Laughter] [Laughter] who said you can't have fun at church sure you can oh the liberty of the sons of god it's glorious we're gonna have our brother ron come before that we're going to sing it is joy unspeakable is it amen let's sing it i have found his praises [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] speakable and full of glory full of [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music]

this meeting and to be able to stand with generals and preach the gospel of jesus christ it's just it's incredible and to preach to the greatest people on earth it's just incredible and so we we have just so enjoyed it i've enjoyed just feasting and fellowshipping with you and and uh we so love you with all of our hearts and and uh i would love to just to be able to shake every one of your hands and brother tim explained it last night for me and that was so nice that he would do that and you give me patience i'm i'm going to get well [Music] how do you know brother ron the word says that i had a visitation and and uh for those that don't believe that's happening it's happening but i had a visitation and i was sitting kind of on a front row kind of where you guys would be and i was sitting and and i was there and i was under great expectation of what the speaker would say and it was brother branham and brother branham was in a in a in an incredible suit i never seen that kind of fabric as he was standing there he was just talking and reminiscing about the phenomenal works of god he was just talking to the people and as he was talking to us we we seem to just be spellbound i kind of get spellbound when i'm listening to a tape when he finished speaking he stepped right to me and had a book in his hand and it was a green bound book and he and it was the way of a true prophet and he and he just looked at me he said ron would you like to have the book that i've used used today i said i'd love it i told him i said brother branham i've loved your message with all my heart i've given my life to it and i love it with all my heart and he patted me on the cheek and he said ron you're going to get well you know those things are just so special to you they're so special you know your word says that we have the most powerful quotes in the world and most powerful songs in the world but those little visitations sure help you along life's way and amen and i know maybe you're suffering in many different directions i want you to know you're going to get well i i came with several things on my heart and the lord had spoken to me and and i'm now going to share something with you uh the lord has spoke to me to to speak in a mess in a mess in a mess and maybe you were in a mess in your life and god was rich in mercy and you're no longer in that mess anymore amen amen but another part would be that i have a vision that i would stand in at this time and and pray for brother ed and his family and this church as you move forward as you move forward i've been a part of you for for a long time now amen and brother tim's been here much longer than i have but i i would just like to pray for brother ed and his family and have brother tim join me and brother

ghost to guide your life as you study may the holy ghost be in your i know it's been that way for years but may it be in a greater way now we as a ministry a team because we're all a team nobody's

proud we're proud of you we love you i don't know if your mother's here amen god bless you god bless you amen amen brother tim heavenly father just now here we stand in this incredible moment lord if brother harold could look across the balcony just now thank you lord as brother minnow prayed when many men pass off of the scene their churches begin to die and regress and it becomes nothing but a great big building but it becomes empty the spirit of god leaves because it was built on personality but god this building was built to serve your purpose father it's not upon a man and it'll never be upon a man but god you raise men to oversee a congregation to attend to the needs not only of the elderly but plumbed down to the look the littlest baby now father we ask you that you would anoint him like never before [Music] thank you father for his life thank you for his family we even thank you for the restoration of his son through this weekend dear god lord jesus how mindful that you are that you're a god of grace and mercy now we ask you that you would anoint brother ed like never before father oh god may the people see the holy ghost moving in his life may they see more than brother ed but may they see you may they hear with a trained ear the voice that is behind the voice oh god and may as he speak lord of may that one sermon touch so many souls lord as the word is the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the hearts i pray that that word would go to its resting place to inspire and to encourage and to strengthen oh god i pray that you would anoint him and his family that's the darks of hell comes against them i pray that father may angels stand guard like never before father to watch over them bless the church we pray in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and

help your ministry in so many ways amen god bless you god bless you brother moses amen many years ago you were going to ask me a question in the hall and i was so tired i couldn't answer that question i'm sorry i'm sorry for that you probably don't remember that yeah amen god bless you all your marriage moving here was god's directing because he had a bigger plan god bless you for the max god knows how to bring a man to a place don't he to be on a team now a team is when we have no egos of our own we don't pull different ways we're we're a team that's what we are we're a team yeah we're team as a body or internationally we're all a team and and the devil would have us to throw rocks at one another but you remember who the rocks should be thrown at not at one another but at goliath himself and amen don't throw him at your brother you throw him at goliath amen amen let's just pray father you place in the body give you special gifts thank you lord lord there's no one man ministry we're not looking for another prophet lord god we we just know that you place different gifts in the body to have different places and i asked you that you would ignite every one of their gifts lord may it may it start at home as it starts at home in their study and is their prayer life and their wives and their children lord jesus i ask you lord god that their home would have an atmosphere of the presence of god and may that presence of god be like an overflow of a cup down into the saucer that others can enjoy i pray in their study that they would just be ignited by certain words that would jump off of the pages and those words would go to intended purposes to strengthen your children father now lord whether we're preaching to 10 people or 500 we ask you that you would help us father to always look up to see the master is he pleased oh god we're not to be men pleasers but we're to be god pleasers brother branham said we must be isolated lord and i asked you that you would just help us to be isolated into your presence father lord god in the name of jesus christ may this tabernacle be a beacon of light to win souls into the kingdom of god we don't have long to work so let us work while it is day in jesus christ we give it all to you father now amen amen and amen amen amen god bless you amen god bless you god bless you god bless you i amen god bless you brother i love you amen amen have i missed any am money have i missed anybody you got it amen god bless you amen amen hallelujah isn't it nice how god operates any good to us and we all at the same time could could say lord let me rededicate my life amen i don't waste a day do you i want to serve him with all my heart that's what i want to do i want to serve him and and maybe maybe you live in this community and maybe you've been out of church well why would you waste another weekend without coming to church and come and you know lay your criticisms down and your unforgiving nonsense and come to church and light the fire let the holy spirit deal with your lives and amen it'll it'll do you good it'll do you good amen and and and i know i know this whole community will be blessed by that and amen and so we brother ed thank you for having this meeting for us to come and thank you for everything and we love you with all of our hearts and all the other ministries that have that have uh dismissed their services and thank you thank you so much i've got the fellowship with some of you some of i haven't been able to let's give them all a great big hand amen one of these days one of these days we'll sit down together we won't have one of these and we won't be tired and and we'll maybe be able to talk about some memories and and thoughts and you know this mortal life won't mean too much then amen it's want to be wonderful i think sometimes i think sometimes our our minds we think we know what it's like but i'd say in the first five seconds we we will realize we didn't have it figured out amen hallelujah a place of perfect love and we were given a message that would get us there and and maybe you'll hear your minister scream to you get back in line and it was for your good amen you know i think about when when you were just told just a moment ago about you know brother tim speaking hour and a half i think i spoke an hour and a half last night and we're not going to try to figure out how long timothy spoke and and i just gave out all i could give out last night and some of you were worried about that but you know what i rested real well and we're back here you know and you know i i know we're this is only for a short season and where minister goes an hour and a half or two hours and i don't i'm not going to set you up for that but but i you know when when a person goes to a ball game and they pay an enormous amount of money for a ticket for a seat that they can't see sitting with people they really don't like and it's an extremely emotional place and if your team is winning [Applause] before you know it it's done got late and two or three o'clock in the morning before you got back home and you spent five hundred dollars thirty dollars for a hot dog and a pepsi and you did all of that and then you come and you sit in an hour and a half service and a guy preached and and he preached to you and your devil goes he's going way too long you need to remind him of what he had you doing [Applause] well maybe you hockey fans up here maybe y'all don't get excited or anything i i don't know but down in south where there's football and there's a potential when they their teams start running out of the tunnels and a hundred thousand fans are screaming and the electricity in the building the earth actually begins to shake i think it's time for the bride of christ to shake the earth a little bit amen i'm going to ask my brother to help me on the monitor because i've got three services over the next week and and start again wednesday and friday at brother joe greens would you pray for me that god would just help us there and amen if i blow my voice here there's going to be some mad people and so amen especially joe green and i don't want him mad so amen could we stand to our feet isn't he wonderful to us maybe you have a need on your heart and maybe i know there's prayer lines it's been prayer lines every service but and maybe you still have a need and you just like to say lord jesus would you pass by my way amen amen heavenly father we can never thank you enough i personally couldn't thank you enough thank you to be standing here [Music] i take these moments very seriously i love you with all my heart [Music] i dedicated my life to you many many years ago brother ed and myself dedicated our lives to youth at the same age 22 years old now here we stand i thank god that i can look back and say that no regrets i'll give it all all my life and now lord jesus i ask you one more time that you would anoint us as we turn to your word now you know how to talk to your wife so if there's any gift that any of us would have is to get ourselves out of the way that's what we pray for lord we thank you for visions and dreams and visitations those those those incredible moments guide us to these moments but lord let us get ourself out of the way rebecca was not going to marry eleazar she was going to marry isaac the important one that's in the room is you father and you know how to touch our lives maybe we've been neglectful father maybe we put some things off now i ask you that you would speak to our hearts and anoint our lips in a mighty way we pray in the name of jesus christ we ask you amen and amen and amen god bless you amen if you will turn with me to revelations chapter 21 and verse 1. hallelujah i want to read to you about your future revelations 21 in verse 1 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said i unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of water of life freely and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son i want us to read that last verse together he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he will be my son you can be seated i'd like to title this evening after an incredible meeting like what we've had with all the emotions that we've had all the miracles that we have taken in the things that we have witnessed with our own eyes what has happened in our hearts we have been reminded over and over again of we have a hope for revival and that we're a part of the revival that god has a plan i'd like to title this just for a few moments on addressing the troops i want to remind you of what a gathering that you are you're gathering from all places all over maybe canada and the internet will could say all over the world it is not a man that has gathered you but god has gathered you now if we could say this you were pre-planned your birth was pre-planned you couldn't come in another age you couldn't come under another messenger you couldn't come at another time you might have said well i would like to live here i'll like to done that or maybe i'd like to been with moses or noah or one of those others i'd like to be in here with jesus when he sat with the woman at the well i'd like to have been here with brother brown and watched that that that man that wanted to stomp him into the ground i'd like to have been in that service or maybe the service that the wind blew through the building or when the seals were revealed when brother branham would say night after night i don't know what tomorrow night is and then he would say he i was about to make a horrible mistake but he came but you see god reserved you [Applause] he knew the type of age and the condition that would be here he knew even 2 000 years ago as he addresses the church of that day of what we were going to face he was not just preaching to them two in the field want to be taken want to be left as it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah so shall it be in the days of the son of man he knew that we were coming he knew the conditions he knew the horse riders he knew he knew all of these things that were preparing but he also knew that there was a lamb's book of life and he had to go to calvary and pay the price of redemption knowing that you were coming [Applause] and he had to pay for the title deed of your life knowing what your original origin was way beyond that fleshly order of being able to calculate and study your way back to adam in the fleshly form god thought of you before the foundation of the world in his great photo album he took a picture of you at your best [Applause] now he didn't do that just to see if he could do it being the great author and the finisher of the faith or or the great god that could create and speak the world into existence he didn't just call you or raise you up just to see if he could do it he didn't just have a tree from an acronym just to see if he could do it he didn't allow certain things just to see if he could do it he had a purpose [Applause] he had a plan [Applause] he is in control of it all so in god's plan no doubt satan could watch as different ones attributes drop down through the ages and a certain profit would rise and immediately satan would begin to buffet them why no doubt in that that dimension satan can watch that pillar of fire moving as it moves over a certain individual do you think it's strange that the devil begins to fight you as soon as you come to the lord [Applause] are you with me brother brown said you just never staggered into a meeting somewhere another and you and you thought it was all on your own god brought you there [Applause] you were making choices that were taking you away from god but god rich in mercy most times god finds his children in trouble god rich in mercy finds you and being a god that will not lose one [Applause] [Music] sometimes he'll let you run and run and run and run and run and run and and for those that think that their children will never come home let me just say commit them to god you got a covenant with god you got a token with god don't you give up [Applause] when when as we spoke the other day about abraham and god told him he said abraham can you count the sand you know sometimes we think about that thought and we just let it go can you imagine what an phenomenal thought abraham can you count them you can't hardly i i stood the other day with sand in my hand and i and i thought about it you can't count the grains of sand hardly in the palm of your hand much less the whole world [Applause] god had a plan much bigger than abraham could see [Applause] so shall thy seed be abraham can you count the stars in the heaven i i can't do it everyone in this order in its place written the first bible everyone fell to a certain spot and dropped off of the clinker in it amazing how the prophet explained the creation and he explained how that god allowed that clinker to fall to a certain spot and he stopped it and it hangs there and it just hangs there it's a got a representation no light of its own but the light comes from the sun we don't have any light of our own the light comes from the sun [Applause] now if i could address you today in in the south we had a civil war and men like robert e lee would address the troops and tell them that we're we're getting ready for a battle some of you are going to be victorious today we're fighting for a cause and he knew for all well there was a lot of responsibility to him that he had to do it right as a natural man he was sending men to their death they were carrying a banner they had a cause every war has a cost [Music] every war has a cost wars are going on all over the world stonewall jackson a man named winston churchill would stand before a great audience of many soldiers as a war was raising thousands and thousands of men were there they asked him to be the speaker that evening and he walked up and he got to that that place and everybody was under great expectation of what he would say being a statesman of the world one of the leaders of the entire world and he steps up to that podium that day and he said never give up and he pauses three minutes and he says never give up and he pauses again and he screams with the loudest voice that he can scream never give up and he gave those men courage [Applause] that's what this meeting is about are you with me we're facing laodicean darkness a world that is falling apart but you were not predestinated to fall or to lose [Applause] you were not predestinated to go back you were predestinated to overcome this age i said as a matter of fact god anointed you and elected you and placed you in position and gave you the best armor that he could give you the best message that he could give you [Music] this message was more than a man walking to a pulpit with controversial doctrines it was more than a man calling the dress code this was the voice behind the voice speaking to a bride that could overcome this message is not to the unbeliever you'll never polish us up enough to be politically correct [Applause] our intentions is not to stay here for the tribulation period [Music] our mission our mandate is to overcome amen are you with me now it is a personal agenda between you and god as a young person as a married person as an elderly person we have a mandate [Applause] we shall overcome as fathers of homes we believe this with all of their hearts as for me and my house we will serve the lord [Applause] we need more than a promise keepers convention where we make vows we need the holy ghost in our homes we need the power of god to give us overcoming power we will not surrender we will not back down [Applause] george washington was persistent at valley forge all the odds was against him the enemy was across the river but after an all night in prayer and the american soldiers with no shoes on their feet about one-third had shoes on and crossed that river the valley forged through the ice three musket bullets went through his coat don't talk to me about courage when you quit church because somebody didn't shake your hand three musket bullets any one of them they didn't just shoot them just see if they could shoot them they meant to take that general's life [Applause] let me just say this to you the devil would destroy you in a second [Applause] but you are better protected than the president of the united states of america [Applause] i don't know about your prime minister he's a boy i might have trouble at the border our president is surrounded by men that are willing to give their life they're trained to take care of him they're trained to watch over him but you're protected way much better than they are [Applause] there's angels that you can't see that standing guard over top of you brother ron but you're way out there stretching am i brother branham said when god told moses's mother and father to put baby moses in a bull rush and put it in a crocodile infested water and put it down in that now he said god dispatched angels ten thousand angels along that now [Applause] and told gabriel personally to stand on that basket and every time an alligator came up and put his nose on the basket push it back down and willie would get in a whirlwind get him out of the whirlwind listen you're gonna get in some whirlwinds in your life there's some crocodiles that's gonna come your way but if you can only see tonight there's thousands of angels that are protecting you [Applause] folks i haven't come to entertain you i've come to tell you we have a charge and we have a mandate let's finish this let's finish this this ain't no time to run and hide this is a time to fight like you've never fought before [Applause] when we walk into a pulpit male of god don't you walk into a pulpit with some kind of psychology and some intellectual speech to to rub the cat the right way you pray long enough until god speaks to you [Music] drive back the demons of hell may your church have such a meaning that it'll shake the shingles off of the top of the roof that's a direct quote he had an answer from god and there was no need of him backing down nothing could stop him he crossed it because he was persistent he heard from god listen to brother branham as he kneels down beside of that little boy that the bones are sticking through its clothes and that baby's dead and he saw the vision two years before people wrote it down in the fly leaf of their bible brother random told it over and over and over again you know these silly critics that want to criticize brother branham don't know the whole story he told people all over to write this down in the fly leaf of your bible two years later they come on the scene and the angel has to remind brother branham and turn him around over and over that to look at the scene was that boy in a prayer line was he at church did we see him in a meeting i've seen him before and then it hits him now watch him say this later he said you just don't know how that feels you know when you're where you're at all the devil's out of hell yeah if they'd line up everything there wasn't hell up around it'd never stop it [Applause] when a man knows where he's at now let me just say this to you if that's god's prophet and we're under the message of god's prophet you can line up every devil out of hell against you how many people do we have as believers in the building [Applause] line up every devil every devil against you every devil the strongest to the weakest [Applause] line up in every one of them and they can't stop you because you know where you're at now i remember i i knelt to his to this side of the as the in the vision when i prayed you have to do just as the vision seen it and i knelt down and they all gathered around and i said now watch thus saith the spirit of god this boy's life will return to him you know men of god as we walk to the pulpit and take the gospel we know god will back his word up [Applause] we've learned now that we're just the microphone and he is the voice and god will god knows how to find his seed he knows where you're at he takes impossible things and makes them possible i'm one of those prodigal children i want to say this you don't you give up my mama years ago and my daddy long years ago never gave up on me [Applause] don't you give up now that quote was said many many years ago but what about today could you say that about your life god i want my life such an order until angels of god till the word of god is so operating in our life now let me just say this to you as we heard over and over about the revival happening but it's more than just for church it's for your home it's for your home it's for your children and your children's children and your grandchildren are you with me now in psalms 91 for those that know it's my favorite scripture he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide into the shadow of the almighty and i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him in him will i trust [Applause] surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the foul and for the noise of the pestilence he's making you a promise and he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flieth by they nor the pestilence that walketh in the darkness nor the destruction that wastes at that noon day a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eye shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come now thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways the moment that you're standing in has been preserved for you we read in revelation chapter 19 and verse 6 and i heard as if it were a great voice of a great multitude as a voice of many waters a voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth [Applause] for those that don't believe in emotion you might want to plug your ears let us be glad and rejoice [Applause] i can just imagine myram moses's sister as she looked back at her enemies defeated those people that had tormented her now for decades and decades some of their torment was more than her life could sustain but god had been with her knowing that there was going to come a prophet god might have made a promise sure it come from her family but she she had to wait and wait till he realized who he was that's kind of what we've had to do wait and wait tough realize who we are but everything's right on time god's always on time she stood there at the red sea with the rest of them and she watched her brother prophet stand there and cry out to god they were thinking it was a bloodbath that was getting ready to happen they had been led in the wrong direction and all of a sudden god speaks to him take what's in your hand speak moses don't cry out to me speak we gotta take action it's not your emotions it's the word of god the power of life and death is in your tongue you must speak you must worship you must praise the lord you must pray [Applause] i read a sign on the way here 30 minutes to get you back in shape if i lived here i'd go there at least one time if that's all it takes 30 minutes to get me back in shape i'll take that a lot of people want to come to one service they only just come to one service and they think oh now i got it made oh no welcome the wolf [Music] the water opened up they crossed across on dry land that phenomena had never happened now somewhere another there's going to be somebody explain that away but those people walked across and they experienced it [Music] [Applause] somewhere there's going to be a group of people that are going to be on the earth that have believed a message and that rap the rapturing faith has been placed on the inside of them and they've been in the process of rapture for a long time but somewhere about nine six to nine o'clock [Applause] there's gonna start something in their body and all the quotes that they have been building up the armor that has been building up the overcoming that they've done on a daily basis the feeding on the word that they have been doing [Applause] let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen and the clean and white and the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he said unto me rot blessed are they they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true saiyans of god now if i could just say this to you there will not be an extra seat there neither will it be one seat short brother ed and sister sandy had us for for brunch brunch march and they had us for brunch and they had a long table and they had a little name tag there and it had my name this is where i sit i was invited and we accepted the invitation and and we came we enjoyed fellowship we ate it was my place there will come a time that i'll we'll step from this dimension because god has a plan [Applause] and he's got a seat waiting on you there and if i could address the troops or not god's plan will not be thwarted now when jesus was making his way toward the cross there was nothing that satan could do to stop him if he would have only note what jesus was getting ready to accomplish he would have never taken one drop of blood [Applause] when he sentenced him to be beaten like no other man do you not realize jesus's silence his silence was much more powerful than his words because he could have called ten thousand angels and one of them could have changed the entire scene [Applause] standing in this condition brother barry i would like to remind satan there was a conversation took place in 46 between god's prophet and an angel of the lord and that angel of the lord told him his commission if we could just say this it was an address of a troop and he he heard he heard a prophet explain to him the hindrances of humanity around the world a country boy no education oh that seemed infathable of how god was going to use him but god was giving him a commission i want to remind you as we sit here tonight we're the only people on earth that is accompanied by the mighty angel there's a lot of people that quote the same quotes that you quote they use the same scriptures that you use but because you are who you are [Applause] there's power behind your words [Applause] are you with me now i'm going to take you three places at one time here i stand preaching the gospel and even as i preached over the last couple of years doctors say that i've had cancer for about eight years during that time the lame has walked the blind has seen the dead has been raised [Applause] my god is more than able maybe the doctors are telling you your case is impossible come back to this night while i'm addressing the troops you're going to go into some war there's going to be some storms that you heard about this morning we're not going to walk out of this building after this meeting into a perfect paradise life is real but we're called to battle we're called to be challenged [Applause] but remember jesus was carried to that block and he was beaten like no other man that would ever be beaten because the scripture said he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for mine iniquities he took those stripes that we could be healed and regardless of your circumstances it doesn't make a difference about the circumstances not even cancer i would like to say this to satan himself brother ron you're acting bold tonight satan doesn't have the license to come and take my life before he could come and attach my life he had to go to my father because brother brother said he can't touch you he can't touch a hair of your head until he goes to the father and the father's got confidence in you that you'll make it through your trial that's my confidence in your flesh his confidence is in the seed that he put on the inside of you that seed is not a temporary seed [Applause] it's not a seed that it's just good when it's good times or when everything's all right that seed will hold you through eternity [Applause] [Music] satan says i'll take your life he can't do it he can't take your life he don't have the right to take your life as a matter of fact he's only a two in god's two box he's a stupid devil he shows up at church knowing he's going to get whipped he's the best attender of all of our churches he never gets offended he walks into our building he walks right in here he gets his impugn he sits down and they start singing songs of zion oh he no doubt collapse his hands but when the preacher starts preaching it starts tearing him apart and casting him out no doubt when those demons go back to hell they gotta give a report throwed me out again throwed me out again [Applause] so why don't we take courage tonight every time he shows up in your home and you feel that little friction spirit that little naughty spirit why don't you throw him out send him back to hell where he came from you're not welcome in our church you're not welcome in my home you're not welcome in my life [Applause] i think we should have some expectations of being victorious never think a negative thought i think we should believe what the prophet of god said that we're an invincible army we should remember where we came from i came from god and i'm going back to god [Applause] and there's not a devil in hell can stop that hey there's not a devil in hell why don't you say that with me and there's not a devil in hell that can stop them [Music] why don't you say it with attitude there's not a devil in hell can say that hey let's have a party have a party you can round them all up that stand against you no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper glory glory glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] brother ron are you trying to work us up i'm just trying to get you to look in the mirror [Applause] if you could see how big your faith muscles [Applause] hey [Music] one more scripture you can all stand want to address you as all your troops i want to congratulate you for graduating this weekend's class i wasn't the keynote speaker but i happen to be the ending speaker and as we dismiss you from this rally where we are reminded of who we are with the pope doing what he's done and russia doing what they are doing and your government's doing what it's doing and sodom's doing what it's doing and the world's doing what it's doing god put something on the inside of you that's greater than every challenge greater than every challenge you will face caleb welcome home welcome to the war but the god that's here is greater than every challenge you will face how many of you give your heart to the lord this weekend you've given your heart jack you got a real experience this morning you've raised your hands raise them high don't be ashamed how many you got refilled with the holy ghost this weekend [Applause] [Music] want to remind you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so when satan shows up to fight you with enough pull out your bazooka paul is saying this in philippians chapter 3 and verse 13. brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus could we read that last scripture together i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus i'd like for you if it don't make you feel uncomfortable but i'd like for you especially men to men or husband to wife i'd like for you to lay your hand over on your neighbor now i'm sure that we still have challenges that we have to fight things at difficulty in our mind because the greatest battle that's ever been fought is in the mind but i want you to remember to feed it the right source rededicate yourself right here tonight i know this has been a great meeting probably one of the greatest it just seems like that every service always keeps climbing higher when you come back wednesday night or whenever the next service is it'll get better and better and better and better just when you think it can't get no better he just always gets better and better and better you just keep falling in love with him but at the end of these services why don't we rededicate ourselves to god like never before why don't we just ask god for a refilling of the holy spirit let's ask the holy spirit through this building come wave after wave after wave come across our lives surrender ourself to him raise the white flag of surrender to jesus christ oh heavenly father oh what i mean it's been you from the beginning to the end it was the expectation of your children now father as we have addressed

[Music] let's sing it with all of our hearts now [Music] all the ways is [Music] [Music] [Music] brother tim and i have preached to you this week [Music] he suffered as hard a trial as you can have to lose his mate he didn't stop he has a renewed challenge standing in the pulpit preaching like never before with a passion to finish this amen we've made it obvious to you and thank you for every prayer of the trial that we've been through but if there's anything that i can leave you with god's with you amen amen god's with you maybe sometimes your trial and while you're all alone seems like it's more than you can possibly stand we understand that statement oh yeah [Music] i'd like for us to sing that last verse one more time brother branham understood you know when a writer comes from god and it those words came from god and it came from his heart he'd lived it [Music] there may be times that you feel like i'm gonna give up don't you worry there's a dub of the holy spirit if you're conscious at all the holy spirit is in this building right now and if we could finish this meeting tonight let's sing this together with all of our hearts [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] faith was by the father above [Music] he gave me [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] brotherhood asked me if i wanted to share anything about that service i was in [Music] because my mind just goes back for a moment the many great things that would happen in that meeting we would go there every thanksgiving we lived right across the river in a little town called bossier and shreveport was right next to us that's where i was born because at that time bozier didn't have a hospital so just across the river my mother gave birth to me in 1954. [Music] so brother jack moore being a minister in the area we knew him and we'd learn a brother branham we'd hear of um the many wonderful works and would go to the meetings like the first meeting i would be in would be in 1956 when i was only two years old and we would be out on the fairground my family would be and we would actually sort of sit on the hood of the car and we would listen to brother branham preach now we are fast forward and over into the last service the last time that i would see brother branham be in the service and brother branham would sing this song and in that service they would have an old-fashioned prayer line and in the prayer lines of that meeting there was a young girl there that also attended that meeting she actually came from a town about 50 miles away she was a methodist girl and she was a cheerleader in high school and she happened to attend that meeting too because some years before her uncle who happened to be a neighbor in the same subdivision that i lived in we played with his kids and they had um you know halloween come around and so their their kids of course and the neighborhood kids would dress up with whatever kind of halloween costume that would come around well my mother never missed an opportunity to witness so in every child's sack when a a wheel of prophecy pointing to one god [Music] dropped in every child's sack and this got home to our neighbors there and this young man with his family was studying to be a church of christ preacher [Music] and was going to be he was going to seminarian he took that track and studied it all him scriptures pointing to one god and after he after he read through all of those he light began to dawn in his heart and [Music] shortly thereafter he moved to florida and um so when he was in florida there this new venture and journey that he was on took him into the full gospel realms and now in the full gospel realms he would hear brother branham and he'd come to realize he was a prophet he was malachi 4. so he comes all the way over into louisiana from florida and stops by his sister's house in hainesville and says to his his sister and his niece said come go with me to the meeting there's a prophet in the line i want you to hear him and they were there in that meeting on the wings of the snow white dove and this young girl her name was jeannie she would become she would she's a part of my church now was wife to now to one of my deacons and sister genie was just this young girl cheerleader very whirling her husband to be which she would marry would be a football star in the there and you know they were very wrapped up in that but she had heard about this prophet and and it was an open line so anybody could go in and so they just gave everybody a card just to kind of keep it in order and but you just went through kind of a fast line and memorial times of years past and as genie came up into the line with her uncle and her mother has her her mother just ahead of them was a woman and brother branham stopped her in the prayer line this woman he said um you are desiring a great thing you're desiring a child he said but there's um a habit in your life you have been smoking and if you'll repent of that gotta give you that baby well genie about four back in the prayer line from that had been slipping around smoking herself and all of a sudden she realized that she'd come in the presence of something she had never known before they could tell the thoughts and intents of the heart know what you were doing and she began to pray god whatever you do don't let that man tell my mother i've been smoking forgive me right now lord i didn't realize how wrong that was forgive me just think four people behind this one and just that little prayer when she stepped up into that prayer line there she said brother tim there was a presence like you would never understand or could know unless you experience it the angel of god was right there with such a presence but just four people later just can you imagine how long it takes to lay hands god never revealed it at all to the prophet of god it was forgiven and under the blood so under the blood a prophet could not call it out of her life the past was gone and i want you to know he'll bring you that same kind of deliverance and i believe he's done that and these guys this meetings you got a clean past because he has signed your pardon you can go free you can walk out of here with a clean slate ahead nothing marked against you you're a child of god you're an heir of the promise amen you've been addressed tonight go forth unto battle now amen god bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i believe this has been one of the greatest meetings we've ever had these meetings and i i believe it's only going to get better whatever god has for us and his brother tim was relating about that song on the wings of a dove the very meeting that he was in and you hear that prophet saying it was something he'd lived out brother ron i think it was in 2019 you were just getting ready to speak a message you're getting ready to speak a message in cloverdale and you just got the report of the cancer and brother ron came out and he spoke a message and the message was entitled courage and we have seen the greatest display of courage this wasn't as brother branham would say he talked about where was that fire in louisville the louisville fire department you know is a fire out let's just you know sprinkle a little water here sprinkle a little water here that's not a captain he said a real captain takes the ax and goes up the ladder into the fire we're watching a man that has gone into the fire we're watching someone that has stood it and i'll say this god is using him like never before because i've gotten courage from him you've gotten courage for him this is not this is not just sprinkling a little water on a meeting and going to another one this is all in and i think we got to go all in [Music] we started i think a week and a half ago brother meno brother gift came through here and brother gift spoke on a wednesday night on the zeal of the father's house [Music] and we were challenged and then brother timothy came and he spoke on the day of miracles it's our turn and then we talk brother tim came and talked about the hope of our revival he asked the question i don't think it's a question anymore i believe we got the answer and brother ron spoke about in a mess but anytime god speaks it's not to leave us in that state i believe he pointed right back to the father of our faith abraham was in a mess but god stood for him that same god standing for us and he addressed the troops tonight we're gonna go out from these meetings we're gonna encounter some battles we're going to think oh i wish i was back in that meeting no i want us to take something with us some courage there's something just been on my heart i asked brother andrew this morning and we had to leave and he said the prayer line kept going and going thank you brother timothy for praying but many people were praying for lost loved ones there's something about that dove the wings of a dove it's purity but it's also a homing bird it's a bird that returns home i brother john where are you brother john i would like for you and the group that sings with you to come up and sing oh daughters of zion i'm bringing you home and i want you to think for a minute friends this is the hour jesus never would have spoke about prodigals if he knew there wouldn't be some i want to remind you when brother ron spoke here is a couple years ago and it was the service on the wings of a dove he concluded singing that song and brother ron he saw that dove there was something supernatural that happened in that meeting we had a young man actually it was one of my sons had to go and he had to go out and do something and he left his seat right in the front there wasn't a seat to be had in the house and he went in the back and logan boyer walked in the room and he sat right at the front here if you remember that brother ken that song we were singing it for brother ken brother ken has gone sister shelly you're here you've got boys they're part of the promise brother danny koenig you got you got children brother mark kesser brother jerry sister rachel how many have got loved ones i believe that's part of the promise i believe that god's gonna bring prodigals home i believe there's a greatest outpouring coming yet and we're not gonna let go this is our battle this is part of what we're going to do and i want you to think about this as they sing and then we're going to have prayer this is not just a man this is the heart of god this is god this was what he expressed to israel in jeremiah when they were in the land i'm going to bring you back home this is a restoration message i'm going to bring you back home jesus said i will lose none of them no one can pluck him from my hand i want us to go out with courage you may have your seats i'd like him to sing the last verse of this is not part of the original song it was penned by brother tim is that right but the tim and he refers to zion zion is a type of the bride i want you to think about israel and what brought israel home what's bringing us home and we're not going to go home till everyone is in and that's why we're laboring that's we're fighting i want you to go out and say god knows exactly where everyone's at and i want you to go out and say we're all behind you and we're gonna see everyone come listen i'm gonna stop let's let's hear them sing this please [Music] oh daughters of zion o abraham's sons [Music] hear the words of your father hear his promise and love i will make you a blessing count the stars if you can you will be a great nation i will give you this i will bring you back home bring you back home oh my children you will no longer stand alone in the night there is nothing on earth that could take you away once i gather you under my wings i will bring you all back home again though you've wandered like strangers to the ends of the earth i will send you a savior i will finish my work you have no other shepherd [Music] green pastures are waiting it's dying i will bring you back home bring you back home oh my children [Music] there is on earth that could take you away once i gather you under my wings i will bring you all back home so we pray for the peace we look to the east for the sun rises sudden and tears every prophet and priests [Music] we will mourn for the one we have pierced but don't fear all my daughters or sons of abraham i will wash you with water i will offer them though your sins were like scarlet [Music] i have always been with you i will never let go i will bring you back home i'll bring you back home of my children you will no longer lost [Applause] [Music] there is nothing on earth that could take you away i will gather you under my wings i will

gather you i will bring you all back home i will bring you all back home [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i got power here good i don't believe we ought to leave this meeting without stepping on our land and claiming our inheritance if you've got a lost loved one and you want to step out whether you want to step out in the aisle or you want to come up here but you want to stand for them and you want to make a declaration i'm claiming them for you lord if you want to do that you just come and do it i'm going to ask them to sing that last song again then i'm going to ask brother timothy to pray for us and i want you to pray and i believe god's going to hear these prayers i believe this is a cry of our hearts we have a right to speak the word let's sing that last verse for the timothy you can get ready to pray [Music] fear not i have called you speak my words [Applause] [Music] rapture is [Music] i will bring you back home i'll bring you back home on my [Applause] children you will no longer [Applause] [Music] i will bring you all back home [Music] oh father god this is our cry tonight lord lord jesus many lord [Music] bound on every side father bound by every kind of spirit of hell bound by spirits of drugs and alcohol and lush problems and situations in a mess lord there's a call going forth into the land lord jesus we ask that the father would just begin to pull lord as we get to speak their names and we begin to speak lord and we begin to call we call for resurrection life father to come forth and to pour into these bones lord i reminded of a prophet that stood at a valley of bones and nothing but broken pieces and the spirits of the lord said will these bones live again and lord he said thou knowest and he said you speak and lord we're speaking tonight and we're speaking life in the bodies and no matter where they're at where they're bound and where they're sitting on a bar room stool lord whether they're in their basement whether in their room no matter

impossible situation through every mess father lord that the resurrection alive will pour through every body we pray and we rebuke every devil that has held them and may have every chain fall at their feet and prison doors go open and the lights begin to dawn oh god i'm reminded lord right now of a group of people that began to pray for a man that was in a jailhouse and he was bound and he was he
