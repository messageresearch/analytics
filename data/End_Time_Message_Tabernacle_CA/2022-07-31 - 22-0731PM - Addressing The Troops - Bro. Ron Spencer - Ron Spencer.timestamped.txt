[1:12:49] [Music]
[1:12:50] god bless you all
[1:12:52] was just requested that i sing
[1:12:56] uh tonight
[1:12:58] i wonder if you have the words for garma
[1:13:00] to praise
[1:13:04] um the lord took me out of catholicism
[1:13:07] many years ago and i was baptized about
[1:13:09] 12 years ago in christian baptism
[1:13:12] i accepted the message
[1:13:14] and a few years ago i started praying
[1:13:16] for real experience with the holy ghost
[1:13:18] and
[1:13:19] i knew god was moving in my life but i
[1:13:21] knew something was missing
[1:13:24] and at our fall meetings brother timothy
[1:13:27] preached
[1:13:28] a message
[1:13:29] a new song to sing
[1:13:31] and that's where god used a man
[1:13:34] to speak to me
[1:13:36] and after that service
[1:13:38] i was in such a state of surrender
[1:13:41] in worship that he came down and touched
[1:13:43] me
[1:13:46] and after that i had
[1:13:49] that joy unspeakable and peace that
[1:13:51] passes all understanding
[1:13:54] and i know that's real because it's the
[1:13:55] word
[1:13:58] um
[1:13:59] so this song is basically taken from
[1:14:01] that sermon that
[1:14:03] that changed my life and
[1:14:05] also isaiah 61 and psalm 48 40.
[1:14:17] joining if you know it
[1:14:22] he said he would be even in you
[1:14:25] and give you the peace deep within
[1:14:28] then he placed you in laodicea
[1:14:31] darkest of days you are in
[1:14:35] there is sorrow hatred and envy
[1:14:38] evil spirits waging war
[1:14:41] it's singing a song but don't listen
[1:14:44] you don't sing that song anymore
[1:14:48] so put on a garment of praise
[1:14:52] get up and walk by
[1:14:54] faith your youth will be renewed you'll
[1:14:57] take a body change
[1:15:02] encourage yourself in the lord
[1:15:05] his word it is your sword oil of joy for

[1:15:15] your life is a song
[1:15:18] and it's no longer your own no there
[1:15:22] isn't a doubt let your life shout it out
[1:15:27] put on a comment of praise
[1:15:32] god chose you for this hour
[1:15:34] so you know you'll make it through don't
[1:15:38] put on a spirit of depression
[1:15:41] let his holy spirit fill you
[1:15:44] it will surely change your tune
[1:15:48] then you'll sing a different song
[1:15:51] and you might call me crazy
[1:15:54] but one day
[1:15:55] i'll be gone
[1:15:57] so put on that garment of praise
[1:16:01] get a by face
[1:16:04] your youth will be renewed you'll take a
[1:16:07] body change

[1:16:41] so put yourself in the word and remember
[1:16:45] david

[1:16:49] discouraged when he encouraged himself

[1:16:57] jail silas heard paul say

[1:48:29] and it becomes nothing but a great big
[1:48:31] building but it becomes empty
[1:48:34] the spirit of god leaves
[1:48:36] because it was built on personality
[1:48:39] but god this building was built
[1:48:42] to serve your
[1:48:44] purpose
[1:48:46] father it's not upon a man
[1:48:49] and it'll never be upon a man

[1:49:56] and may as he speak
[1:49:58] lord of may that one sermon touch so

[1:54:22] purposes

[2:05:01] your future
[2:05:09] revelations 21 in verse 1
[2:05:12] and i saw a new heaven
[2:05:15] and a new earth
[2:05:18] for the first heaven and the first earth
[2:05:20] were passed away
[2:05:21] and there was no more sea
[2:05:24] and i john
[2:05:25] saw the holy city the new jerusalem
[2:05:28] coming down from god out of heaven
[2:05:31] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[2:05:33] husband
[2:05:35] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[2:05:37] saying
[2:05:38] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[2:05:41] and he will dwell with them and they
[2:05:43] shall be his people and god himself
[2:05:45] shall be with them and be their god
[2:05:48] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[2:05:51] their eyes
[2:05:52] and there shall be no more death
[2:05:54] neither sorrow
[2:05:56] nor crying
[2:05:57] neither shall there be any more pain
[2:06:00] for the former things are passed away
[2:06:03] and he that sat up on the throne said
[2:06:06] behold i make all things new
[2:06:09] and he said unto me write for these
[2:06:11] words
[2:06:12] are true
[2:06:14] and faithful
[2:06:16] and he said i unto me
[2:06:19] it is done
[2:06:21] i am alpha and omega
[2:06:24] the beginning and the end
[2:06:26] i will give unto him that is a thirst of
[2:06:30] the fountain of water of life freely
[2:06:34] and he that overcometh
[2:06:39] shall inherit
[2:06:40] all things
[2:06:42] and i will be his god
[2:06:45] and he shall be my son
[2:06:49] i want us to read that last verse
[2:06:51] together
[2:06:53] he that overcometh
[2:06:56] shall inherit all things
[2:06:59] and i will be his god
[2:07:02] and he will be my son
[2:07:04] you can be seated
[2:07:14] i'd like to title this evening after an
[2:07:16] incredible meeting like what we've had
[2:07:20] with all the emotions that we've had
[2:07:23] all the miracles that we have
[2:07:25] taken in
[2:07:27] the things that we have witnessed with
[2:07:29] our own eyes
[2:07:31] what has happened in our hearts
[2:07:34] we have been reminded over and over
[2:07:36] again
[2:07:37] of we have a hope for revival
[2:07:40] and that we're a part of the revival
[2:07:42] that god has a plan
[2:07:46] i'd like to title this just for a few
[2:07:48] moments on
[2:07:50] addressing the troops
[2:07:57] i want to remind you of what a gathering
[2:07:59] that you are
[2:08:01] you're gathering from all places all
[2:08:04] over
[2:08:05] maybe canada
[2:08:07] and the internet will could say all over
[2:08:09] the world
[2:08:12] it is not a man that has gathered you
[2:08:16] but god has gathered you
[2:08:19] now if we could say this you were
[2:08:21] pre-planned
[2:08:24] your birth was pre-planned
[2:08:28] you couldn't come in another age
[2:08:31] you couldn't come under another
[2:08:32] messenger
[2:08:34] you couldn't come at another time
[2:08:37] you might have said well i would like to
[2:08:39] live here i'll like to done that or
[2:08:41] maybe i'd like to been with moses or
[2:08:43] noah or one of those others i'd like to
[2:08:45] be in here with jesus when he sat with
[2:08:48] the woman at the well i'd like to have
[2:08:50] been here with brother brown and watched
[2:08:53] that that that man that wanted to stomp
[2:08:55] him into the ground i'd like to have
[2:08:57] been in that service or maybe the
[2:08:59] service that the wind blew through the
[2:09:02] building or when the seals were revealed
[2:09:05] when brother branham would say night
[2:09:06] after night i don't know what tomorrow
[2:09:08] night is
[2:09:10] and then he would say he
[2:09:13] i was about to make a horrible mistake
[2:09:15] but he came
[2:09:22] but you see god reserved you
[2:09:25] [Applause]
[2:09:27] he knew the type of age and the
[2:09:29] condition that would be here
[2:09:32] he knew even 2 000 years ago as he
[2:09:35] addresses the church of that day of what
[2:09:38] we were going to face
[2:09:40] he was not just preaching to them two in
[2:09:42] the field want to be taken want to be
[2:09:44] left as it was in the days of sodom and
[2:09:48] gomorrah so shall it be in the days of
[2:09:50] the son of man
[2:09:54] he knew that we were coming he knew the
[2:09:56] conditions he knew the horse riders he
[2:09:59] knew he knew all of these things that
[2:10:00] were preparing but he also knew that
[2:10:03] there was a lamb's book of life
[2:10:07] and he had to go to calvary
[2:10:11] and pay the price of redemption
[2:10:14] knowing that you were coming
[2:10:17] [Applause]
[2:10:18] and he had to pay for the title deed of
[2:10:21] your life
[2:10:23] knowing what your original origin was
[2:10:29] way beyond that fleshly order of being
[2:10:32] able to calculate and study your way
[2:10:35] back to adam in the fleshly form
[2:10:38] god thought of you before the foundation
[2:10:40] of the world
[2:10:43] in his great photo album he took a
[2:10:46] picture of you at your best
[2:10:49] [Applause]
[2:10:52] now he didn't do that just to see if he
[2:10:54] could do it being the great author and
[2:10:57] the finisher of the faith or or the
[2:10:59] great god that could create and speak
[2:11:02] the world into existence
[2:11:05] he didn't just call you or raise you
[2:11:08] up
[2:11:10] just to see if he could do it
[2:11:15] he didn't just have a tree
[2:11:17] from an acronym
[2:11:19] just to see if he could do it
[2:11:22] he didn't allow certain things just to
[2:11:25] see if he could do it he had a purpose
[2:11:27] [Applause]
[2:11:31] he had a plan
[2:11:33] [Applause]
[2:11:35] he is in control of it all
[2:11:39] so in god's plan
[2:11:42] no doubt satan could watch as different
[2:11:46] ones attributes drop down through the
[2:11:49] ages and a certain profit would rise and
[2:11:52] immediately satan would begin to buffet
[2:11:54] them
[2:11:56] why no doubt in that that dimension
[2:11:59] satan can watch that pillar of fire
[2:12:01] moving as it moves over a certain
[2:12:04] individual
[2:12:06] do you think it's strange that the devil
[2:12:09] begins to fight you as soon as you come
[2:12:11] to the lord
[2:12:14] [Applause]
[2:12:15] are you with me brother brown said you
[2:12:17] just never staggered into a meeting
[2:12:19] somewhere another and you and you
[2:12:21] thought it was all on your own god
[2:12:23] brought you there
[2:12:24] [Applause]
[2:12:27] you were making choices that were taking
[2:12:29] you away from god but god rich in mercy
[2:12:36] most times god finds his children in
[2:12:39] trouble
[2:12:40] god rich in mercy finds you
[2:12:44] and being a god that will not lose one
[2:12:49] [Applause]
[2:12:49] [Music]
[2:12:52] sometimes he'll let you run and run and
[2:12:54] run and run and run and run and and for
[2:12:56] those that think that their children
[2:12:58] will never come home let me just say
[2:13:00] commit them to god
[2:13:03] you got a covenant with god you got a
[2:13:06] token with god
[2:13:08] don't you give up
[2:13:10] [Applause]
[2:13:19] when when as we spoke the other day
[2:13:21] about abraham
[2:13:24] and god told him he said
[2:13:26] abraham
[2:13:28] can you count the sand
[2:13:33] you know sometimes we think about that
[2:13:36] thought
[2:13:37] and we just let it go
[2:13:41] can you imagine what an
[2:13:45] phenomenal thought
[2:13:48] abraham can you count them
[2:13:53] you can't hardly i
[2:13:55] i stood the other day with sand in my
[2:13:57] hand and i and i thought about it you
[2:14:00] can't count
[2:14:01] the grains of sand
[2:14:08] hardly in the palm of your hand
[2:14:11] much less
[2:14:13] the whole world
[2:14:14] [Applause]
[2:14:16] god had a plan much bigger than abraham
[2:14:19] could see
[2:14:20] [Applause]
[2:14:23] so shall thy seed be abraham can you
[2:14:27] count the stars in the heaven
[2:14:38] i
[2:14:40] i can't do it
[2:14:42] everyone in this order
[2:14:44] in its place
[2:14:46] written the first bible
[2:14:49] everyone fell to a certain spot and
[2:14:53] dropped off of the clinker in it amazing
[2:14:55] how the prophet explained the creation
[2:15:00] and he explained how that god allowed
[2:15:02] that clinker to fall to a certain spot
[2:15:05] and he stopped it and it hangs there
[2:15:09] and it just hangs there it's a got a
[2:15:11] representation
[2:15:13] no light of its own but the light comes
[2:15:15] from the sun
[2:15:22] we don't have any light of our own the
[2:15:24] light comes from the sun
[2:15:26] [Applause]
[2:15:29] now if i could address you today
[2:15:33] in in the south
[2:15:35] we had a civil war
[2:15:38] and men like robert e lee would address
[2:15:41] the troops
[2:15:42] and tell them that we're we're getting
[2:15:44] ready for a battle
[2:15:47] some of you are going to be victorious
[2:15:51] today
[2:15:53] we're fighting for a cause
[2:15:56] and he knew for all well
[2:16:01] there was a lot of responsibility to him
[2:16:03] that he had to do it right
[2:16:06] as a natural man
[2:16:09] he was sending men to their death
[2:16:13] they were carrying a banner they had a
[2:16:15] cause
[2:16:16] every war has a cost
[2:16:19] [Music]
[2:16:20] every war has a cost
[2:16:22] wars are going on all over the world
[2:16:29] stonewall jackson
[2:16:32] a man named winston churchill would
[2:16:34] stand before a great audience of
[2:16:37] many soldiers as a war was raising
[2:16:41] thousands and thousands of men were
[2:16:44] there
[2:16:45] they asked him to be the speaker that
[2:16:47] evening
[2:16:50] and he walked up and he got to that that
[2:16:53] place and everybody was under great
[2:16:55] expectation
[2:16:58] of what he would say being a statesman
[2:17:01] of the world one of the leaders of the
[2:17:03] entire world
[2:17:05] and he steps up to that podium that day
[2:17:07] and he said
[2:17:09] never give up
[2:17:15] and he pauses three minutes
[2:17:18] and he says
[2:17:19] never give up
[2:17:24] and he pauses again
[2:17:26] and he screams with the loudest voice
[2:17:29] that he can scream
[2:17:30] never give up
[2:17:33] and he gave those men courage
[2:17:37] [Applause]
[2:17:40] that's what this meeting is about
[2:17:45] are you with me
[2:17:46] we're facing laodicean darkness a world
[2:17:49] that is falling apart
[2:17:53] but you were not predestinated to fall
[2:17:56] or to lose
[2:17:57] [Applause]
[2:17:59] you were not predestinated to go back
[2:18:02] you were predestinated to overcome this
[2:18:05] age
[2:18:09] i said as a matter of fact god anointed
[2:18:12] you
[2:18:13] and elected you and placed you in
[2:18:16] position and gave you the best armor
[2:18:19] that he could give you the best message
[2:18:21] that he could give you
[2:18:24] [Music]
[2:18:26] this message was more than a man walking
[2:18:28] to a pulpit with controversial doctrines
[2:18:31] it was more than a man calling the dress
[2:18:34] code this was the voice behind the voice
[2:18:38] speaking to a bride that could overcome
[2:18:43] this message is not to the unbeliever
[2:18:48] you'll never polish us up enough to be
[2:18:50] politically correct
[2:18:52] [Applause]
[2:18:55] our intentions is not to stay here for
[2:18:58] the tribulation period

[2:19:40] house
[2:19:41] we will serve the lord
[2:19:44] [Applause]
[2:19:46] we need more than a promise keepers
[2:19:48] convention where we make vows we need
[2:19:52] the holy ghost in our homes
[2:19:55] we need the power of god to give us
[2:19:57] overcoming power
[2:20:00] we will not surrender we will not back
[2:20:03] down

[2:20:16] valley forge
[2:20:18] all the odds was against him
[2:20:21] the enemy was across the river
[2:20:25] but after an all night in prayer
[2:20:28] and the american soldiers with no shoes
[2:20:31] on their feet
[2:20:32] about one-third

[2:20:36] valley forged through the ice

[2:22:01] to take care of him

[2:22:30] to put baby moses in a bull rush
[2:22:36] and put it in a crocodile infested water
[2:22:40] and put it down in that now he said god

[2:22:47] ten thousand angels along that now
[2:22:50] [Applause]
[2:22:51] and told gabriel personally to stand on
[2:22:55] that basket and every time an alligator
[2:22:58] came up and put his nose on the basket

[2:23:58] when we walk into a pulpit male of god
[2:24:01] don't you walk into a pulpit with some
[2:24:03] kind of psychology and some intellectual
[2:24:06] speech

[2:24:21] may your church have such a meaning that
[2:24:23] it'll shake the shingles off of the top
[2:24:25] of the
[2:24:26] roof that's a direct quote
[2:24:35] he had an answer from god
[2:24:38] and there was no need of him backing
[2:24:39] down
[2:24:42] nothing could stop him
[2:24:44] he crossed it because he was persistent
[2:24:50] he heard from god
[2:24:57] listen to brother branham
[2:25:01] as he kneels down beside of that little
[2:25:03] boy
[2:25:04] that the bones are sticking through its
[2:25:08] clothes and that baby's dead
[2:25:11] and he saw the vision two years before
[2:25:15] people wrote it down in the fly leaf of
[2:25:16] their bible
[2:25:18] brother random told it over and over and
[2:25:20] over again
[2:25:21] you know these silly
[2:25:23] critics
[2:25:24] that want to criticize brother branham
[2:25:26] don't know the whole story
[2:25:33] he told people all over to write this
[2:25:35] down in the fly leaf of your bible
[2:25:38] two years later they come on the scene
[2:25:41] and the angel has to remind brother
[2:25:43] branham and turn him around over and
[2:25:44] over that to look at the scene
[2:25:48] was that boy in a prayer line was he at
[2:25:49] church did we see him in a meeting i've
[2:25:51] seen him before and then it hits him
[2:25:55] now watch him say this later he said you
[2:25:58] just don't know how that feels
[2:26:00] you know when you're
[2:26:02] where you're at all the devil's out of
[2:26:04] hell yeah
[2:26:06] if they'd line up everything there
[2:26:09] wasn't hell up around
[2:26:12] it'd never stop it
[2:26:15] [Applause]
[2:26:20] when a man knows where he's at
[2:26:22] now let me just say this to you if
[2:26:24] that's god's prophet and we're under the
[2:26:25] message of god's prophet
[2:26:28] you can line up every devil out of hell
[2:26:30] against you
[2:26:34] how many people do we have as believers
[2:26:36] in the building
[2:26:37] [Applause]
[2:26:40] line up every devil
[2:26:43] every devil against you
[2:26:47] every devil the strongest to the weakest
[2:26:49] [Applause]
[2:26:52] line up in every one of them and they
[2:26:54] can't stop you
[2:26:56] because you know where you're at
[2:27:04] now i remember i i knelt to his to this
[2:27:08] side of the as the
[2:27:09] in the vision when i prayed
[2:27:12] you have to do just as the vision seen
[2:27:14] it and i knelt down and they all
[2:27:17] gathered around and i said now watch
[2:27:21] thus saith the spirit of god
[2:27:25] this boy's life
[2:27:28] will return to him
[2:27:34] you know men of god as we walk to the
[2:27:35] pulpit and take the gospel
[2:27:38] we know god will back his word up
[2:27:41] [Applause]
[2:27:42] we've learned now that we're just the
[2:27:44] microphone and he is the voice
[2:27:48] and god will god knows how to find his
[2:27:50] seed
[2:27:52] he knows where you're at
[2:27:54] he takes impossible things
[2:27:57] and makes them possible
[2:28:02] i'm one of those prodigal children i
[2:28:04] want to say this you don't you give up
[2:28:08] my mama years ago and my daddy long
[2:28:10] years ago never gave up on me

[2:28:37] until angels of god
[2:28:39] till the word of god is so operating in
[2:28:41] our life now let me just say this to you
[2:28:44] as we heard over and over about the
[2:28:46] revival happening
[2:28:47] but it's more than just for church
[2:28:53] it's for your home

[2:28:57] children
[2:29:01] and your children's children
[2:29:04] and your grandchildren
[2:29:09] are you with me now
[2:29:11] in psalms 91 for those that know it's my
[2:29:14] favorite scripture he that dwelleth in
[2:29:16] the secret place of the most high shall
[2:29:18] abide into the shadow of the almighty
[2:29:21] and i will say of the lord he is my
[2:29:23] refuge and my fortress my god in him
[2:29:31] in him will i trust
[2:29:33] [Applause]
[2:29:34] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[2:29:36] snare of the foul and for the noise of
[2:29:38] the pestilence he's making you a promise
[2:29:45] and he shall cover thee
[2:29:47] with his feathers and under his wings
[2:29:48] shalt thou trust
[2:29:50] his truth shall be thy shield and
[2:29:52] buckler
[2:29:53] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[2:29:56] by night nor the arrow that flieth by
[2:29:58] they nor the pestilence that walketh in
[2:30:00] the darkness nor the destruction that
[2:30:02] wastes at that noon day a thousand shall
[2:30:04] fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy
[2:30:07] right hand but it shall not come nigh
[2:30:09] thee
[2:30:10] only with thine eye shalt thou behold
[2:30:12] and see the reward of the wicked because
[2:30:14] thou has made the lord which is my
[2:30:17] refuge
[2:30:19] even the most high thy habitation
[2:30:22] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[2:30:24] shall any plague come now thy dwelling
[2:30:26] for he shall give his angels
[2:30:28] charge over thee to keep thee in all thy
[2:30:31] ways
[2:30:36] the moment that you're standing in has
[2:30:39] been preserved for you
[2:30:41] we read in revelation chapter 19 and
[2:30:44] verse 6 and i heard as if it were a
[2:30:46] great voice of a great multitude as a
[2:30:49] voice of many waters
[2:30:51] a voice of mighty thundering saying
[2:30:53] hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent
[2:30:56] reigneth
[2:30:57] [Applause]
[2:30:59] for those that don't believe in emotion
[2:31:01] you might want to plug your ears let us
[2:31:03] be glad and rejoice
[2:31:06] [Applause]
[2:31:25] i can just imagine
[2:31:27] myram
[2:31:29] moses's sister as she looked back at her
[2:31:31] enemies defeated
[2:31:36] those people that had tormented her now
[2:31:38] for decades and decades
[2:31:42] some of their torment was more than her
[2:31:43] life could sustain but god had been with
[2:31:46] her knowing that there was going to come
[2:31:48] a prophet
[2:31:53] god might have made a promise
[2:31:55] sure it come from her family but she
[2:31:58] she had to wait and wait till he
[2:31:59] realized who he was
[2:32:01] that's kind of what we've had to do wait
[2:32:03] and wait tough
[2:32:06] realize who we are
[2:32:09] but everything's right on time god's
[2:32:11] always on time
[2:32:15] she stood there at the red sea with the
[2:32:17] rest of them and
[2:32:19] she watched her brother prophet
[2:32:21] stand there and cry out to god
[2:32:28] they were thinking it was a bloodbath
[2:32:29] that was getting ready to happen
[2:32:31] they had been led in the wrong direction
[2:32:35] and all of a sudden god speaks to him
[2:32:38] take what's in your hand
[2:32:41] speak moses don't cry out to me
[2:32:44] speak
[2:32:45] we gotta take action
[2:32:49] it's not your emotions it's the word of
[2:32:51] god the power of life and death is in
[2:32:54] your tongue
[2:32:59] you must speak you must worship you must
[2:33:02] praise the lord you must pray
[2:33:05] [Applause]
[2:33:13] i read a sign on the way here
[2:33:16] 30 minutes to get you back in shape
[2:33:22] if i lived here i'd go there at least
[2:33:24] one time
[2:33:30] if that's all it takes 30 minutes to get
[2:33:32] me back in shape i'll take that
[2:33:37] a lot of people want to come to one
[2:33:38] service
[2:33:46] they only just come to one service
[2:33:52] and they think oh now i got it made oh
[2:33:54] no
[2:33:56] welcome the wolf
[2:33:58] [Music]
[2:34:04] the water opened up
[2:34:06] they crossed across on dry land
[2:34:09] that phenomena had never happened
[2:34:14] now somewhere another there's going to
[2:34:16] be somebody explain that away
[2:34:19] but those people walked across
[2:34:22] and they experienced it
[2:34:24] [Music]
[2:34:24] [Applause]
[2:34:26] somewhere there's going to be a group of
[2:34:27] people
[2:34:28] that are going to be on the earth
[2:34:31] that have believed a message
[2:34:33] and that rap the rapturing faith has
[2:34:35] been placed on the inside of them and
[2:34:38] they've been in the process of rapture
[2:34:39] for a long time but somewhere about nine
[2:34:43] six to nine o'clock
[2:34:45] [Applause]
[2:34:47] there's gonna start something in their
[2:34:49] body and all the quotes that they have
[2:34:52] been building up the armor that has been
[2:34:54] building up the overcoming that they've
[2:34:56] done on a daily basis
[2:35:00] the feeding on the word that they have
[2:35:01] been doing
[2:35:03] [Applause]
[2:35:10] let us be glad and rejoice
[2:35:13] and give honor to him for the marriage
[2:35:15] of the lamb is come
[2:35:17] and his wife has made herself ready
[2:35:21] and to her was granted that she should
[2:35:23] be arrayed in fine linen and the clean
[2:35:24] and white and the fine linen is the
[2:35:26] righteousness of the saints
[2:35:28] and he said unto me rot
[2:35:31] blessed are they
[2:35:32] they
[2:35:33] which are called
[2:35:35] unto the marriage supper of the lamb
[2:35:42] and he said unto me
[2:35:44] these are the true saiyans
[2:35:47] of god
[2:35:50] now
[2:35:52] if i could just say this to you
[2:35:55] there will not be an extra seat there
[2:36:02] neither will it be one seat short
[2:36:12] brother ed and sister sandy had us for
[2:36:14] for
[2:36:16] brunch brunch march
[2:36:18] and they had us for brunch and they had
[2:36:20] a long table
[2:36:23] and they had a little name tag there
[2:36:26] and it had my name
[2:36:28] this is where i sit
[2:36:33] i was
[2:36:34] invited and we accepted the invitation
[2:36:40] and
[2:36:43] and we came
[2:36:45] we enjoyed fellowship
[2:36:47] we
[2:36:48] ate it was my place
[2:36:52] there will come a time that i'll we'll
[2:36:54] step from this dimension
[2:37:00] because god has a plan
[2:37:03] [Applause]
[2:37:05] and he's got a seat waiting on you there
[2:37:08] and if i could address the troops or not
[2:37:12] god's plan will not be thwarted
[2:37:19] now when jesus was making his way toward
[2:37:21] the cross
[2:37:23] there was nothing that satan could do
[2:37:28] to stop him
[2:37:34] if he would have only note
[2:37:37] what
[2:37:38] jesus was getting ready to accomplish
[2:37:45] he would have never taken one drop of
[2:37:48] blood
[2:37:49] [Applause]
[2:37:51] when he sentenced him to be beaten like
[2:37:54] no other man
[2:37:58] do you not realize jesus's silence
[2:38:01] his silence was much more powerful than
[2:38:05] his words
[2:38:08] because he could have called ten
[2:38:10] thousand angels
[2:38:12] and one of them could have changed the
[2:38:14] entire scene
[2:38:15] [Applause]
[2:38:20] standing in this condition brother barry
[2:38:23] i would like to remind satan
[2:38:28] there was a conversation
[2:38:30] took place
[2:38:32] in 46
[2:38:35] between god's prophet
[2:38:38] and an angel of the lord
[2:38:42] and that angel of the lord told him his
[2:38:45] commission
[2:38:48] if we could just say this it was an
[2:38:50] address of a troop
[2:38:55] and he
[2:38:56] he heard
[2:38:58] he heard a prophet explain to him
[2:39:03] the hindrances
[2:39:05] of humanity
[2:39:10] around the world
[2:39:12] a country boy
[2:39:14] no education
[2:39:17] oh that seemed infathable
[2:39:22] of how god was going to use him
[2:39:26] but god was giving him a commission
[2:39:29] i want to remind you as we sit here
[2:39:32] tonight
[2:39:34] we're the only people on earth
[2:39:38] that is accompanied
[2:39:40] by the mighty angel
[2:39:48] there's a lot of people that quote the
[2:39:50] same quotes that you quote
[2:39:56] they use the same scriptures that you
[2:39:58] use
[2:40:00] but because you are who you are
[2:40:07] [Applause]
[2:40:08] there's power behind your words
[2:40:11] [Applause]
[2:40:17] are you with me now
[2:40:19] i'm going to take you three places at
[2:40:21] one time here i stand
[2:40:23] preaching the gospel
[2:40:25] and even as i preached over the last
[2:40:28] couple of years doctors say that i've
[2:40:30] had cancer for about eight years
[2:40:33] during that time the lame has walked the
[2:40:36] blind has seen
[2:40:38] the dead has been raised
[2:40:41] [Applause]
[2:40:43] my god
[2:40:45] is more than able
[2:41:04] maybe the doctors are telling you your
[2:41:06] case is impossible
[2:41:08] come back to this night
[2:41:11] while i'm addressing the troops you're
[2:41:14] going to go into some war there's going
[2:41:16] to be some storms that you heard about
[2:41:18] this morning we're not going to walk out
[2:41:21] of this building after this meeting into
[2:41:22] a perfect paradise
[2:41:24] life is real but we're called to battle
[2:41:28] we're called to be challenged
[2:41:30] [Applause]
[2:41:31] but remember jesus was carried to that
[2:41:34] block and he was beaten like no other
[2:41:37] man that would ever be beaten because
[2:41:39] the scripture said he was wounded for my
[2:41:42] transgressions he was bruised for mine
[2:41:44] iniquities he took those stripes
[2:41:51] that we could be healed
[2:41:54] and regardless of your circumstances it
[2:41:57] doesn't make a difference about the
[2:41:58] circumstances
[2:42:00] not even cancer
[2:42:19] i would like to say this to satan
[2:42:21] himself brother ron you're acting bold
[2:42:23] tonight satan doesn't have the license
[2:42:26] to come and take my life
[2:42:29] before he could come and attach my life
[2:42:31] he had to go to my father
[2:42:39] because brother brother said he can't
[2:42:41] touch you he can't touch a hair of your
[2:42:43] head until he goes to the father and the
[2:42:47] father's got confidence in you
[2:42:50] that you'll make it through your trial
[2:43:01] that's my confidence in your flesh his
[2:43:04] confidence is in the seed that he put on
[2:43:07] the inside of you
[2:43:10] that seed is not a temporary seed
[2:43:13] [Applause]
[2:43:16] it's not a seed that it's just good when
[2:43:18] it's good times or when everything's all
[2:43:21] right that seed will hold you
[2:43:24] through eternity
[2:43:26] [Applause]
[2:43:29] [Music]
[2:43:38] satan says i'll take your life
[2:43:40] he can't do it
[2:43:44] he can't take your life
[2:43:48] he don't have the right to take your
[2:43:49] life
[2:43:52] as a matter of fact he's only a two
[2:43:54] in god's two box
[2:43:57] he's a stupid devil
[2:44:01] he shows up at church knowing he's going
[2:44:03] to get whipped
[2:44:18] he's the best attender of all of our
[2:44:20] churches
[2:44:23] he never gets offended
[2:44:26] he walks into our building he walks
[2:44:28] right in here
[2:44:29] he gets his impugn
[2:44:32] he sits down
[2:44:34] and they start singing songs of zion oh
[2:44:37] he no doubt collapse his hands
[2:44:39] but when the preacher starts preaching
[2:44:41] it starts tearing him apart
[2:44:43] and casting him out
[2:44:47] no doubt when those demons go back to
[2:44:49] hell they gotta give a report throwed me
[2:44:51] out again throwed me out again
[2:44:57] [Applause]
[2:45:00] so why don't we take courage tonight
[2:45:04] every time he shows up in your home and
[2:45:06] you feel that little friction spirit
[2:45:09] that little naughty spirit why don't you
[2:45:12] throw him out
[2:45:16] send him back to hell where he came from
[2:45:21] you're not welcome in our church you're
[2:45:23] not welcome in my home you're not
[2:45:26] welcome in my life
[2:45:33] [Applause]
[2:45:43] i think we should have some expectations
[2:45:45] of being victorious
[2:45:49] never think a negative thought
[2:45:53] i think we should believe what the
[2:45:54] prophet of god said that we're an
[2:45:56] invincible army
[2:46:01] we should remember where we came from i
[2:46:03] came from god and i'm going back to god
[2:46:05] [Applause]
[2:46:08] and there's not a devil in hell can stop
[2:46:10] that
[2:46:11] hey there's not a devil in hell why
[2:46:13] don't you say that with me and there's
[2:46:15] not a devil in hell that can stop them
[2:46:18] [Music]
[2:46:20] why don't you say it with attitude
[2:46:22] there's not a devil in hell can say that
[2:46:32] hey
[2:46:34] let's have a party
[2:46:38] have a party
[2:46:46] you can round them all up
[2:46:49] that stand against you
[2:46:51] no weapon that is formed against me
[2:46:56] shall prosper
[2:47:01] glory glory glory glory glory glory
[2:47:04] glory
[2:47:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:47:20] [Applause]
[2:47:26] brother ron are you trying to work us up
[2:47:30] i'm just trying to get you to look in
[2:47:32] the mirror
[2:47:36] [Applause]
[2:47:38] if you could see how big your faith
[2:47:39] muscles
[2:47:42] [Applause]
[2:47:50] hey
[2:48:01] [Music]

[2:48:18] as all your troops
[2:48:23] i want to congratulate you
[2:48:25] for graduating this weekend's class
[2:48:33] i wasn't the keynote speaker but i
[2:48:35] happen to be the ending speaker
[2:48:39] and as we dismiss you from this
[2:48:42] rally
[2:48:45] where we are reminded of who we are
[2:48:49] with the pope doing what he's done
[2:48:54] and russia doing what they are doing
[2:48:57] and your government's doing what it's
[2:48:58] doing
[2:48:59] and sodom's doing what it's doing
[2:49:02] and the world's doing what it's doing
[2:49:07] god put something on the inside of you
[2:49:13] that's greater than every challenge
[2:49:21] greater than every challenge
[2:49:25] you will face
[2:49:29] caleb
[2:49:32] welcome home
[2:49:35] welcome to the war
[2:49:38] but the god that's here is greater than
[2:49:40] every challenge
[2:49:42] you will face
[2:49:46] how many of you give your heart to the
[2:49:48] lord this weekend you've given your
[2:49:50] heart
[2:49:52] jack you got a real experience this
[2:49:53] morning
[2:49:55] you've raised your hands raise them high
[2:49:56] don't be ashamed
[2:49:58] how many you got refilled with the holy
[2:49:59] ghost this weekend
[2:50:02] [Applause]
[2:50:02] [Music]
[2:50:08] want to remind you
[2:50:10] greater
[2:50:13] is he that is in you
[2:50:18] than he
[2:50:20] that is in the world
[2:50:24] so when satan shows up to fight you with
[2:50:27] enough
[2:50:28] pull out your bazooka
[2:50:49] paul is saying this
[2:50:52] in philippians chapter 3 and verse 13.
[2:50:56] brethren i count not myself to have
[2:50:58] apprehended
[2:51:00] but this one thing i do
[2:51:04] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:51:08] and reaching
[2:51:09] forth under those things which are
[2:51:12] before
[2:51:16] i press
[2:51:18] toward the mark
[2:51:21] for the prize
[2:51:22] of the high calling
[2:51:24] of god
[2:51:25] in christ jesus
[2:51:29] could we read that last scripture
[2:51:31] together
[2:51:33] i press
[2:51:36] toward the mark
[2:51:38] for the prize
[2:51:40] of the high calling of god
[2:51:43] in christ jesus
[2:51:48] i'd like for you if it don't make you
[2:51:50] feel uncomfortable but i'd like for you
[2:51:53] especially men to men or husband to wife
[2:51:55] i'd like for you to lay your hand over
[2:51:57] on your neighbor
[2:52:00] now i'm sure that we still have
[2:52:02] challenges that we have to fight
[2:52:04] things at difficulty in our mind because
[2:52:06] the greatest battle that's ever been
[2:52:08] fought is in the mind
[2:52:15] but i want you to remember to feed it
[2:52:17] the right source
[2:52:20] rededicate yourself right here tonight
[2:52:23] i know this has been a great meeting
[2:52:24] probably one of the greatest
[2:52:26] it just seems like that every service
[2:52:28] always keeps climbing higher
[2:52:30] when you come back wednesday night or
[2:52:32] whenever the next service is it'll get
[2:52:34] better and better and better and better
[2:52:37] just when you think it can't get no
[2:52:39] better he just always gets better and
[2:52:41] better and better
[2:52:43] you just keep falling in love with him
[2:52:47] but at the end of these services
[2:52:49] why don't we rededicate ourselves to god
[2:52:52] like never before
[2:52:54] why don't we just ask god for a
[2:52:55] refilling of the holy spirit
[2:52:58] let's ask the holy spirit through this
[2:53:00] building come
[2:53:02] wave after wave after wave
[2:53:05] come across our lives
[2:53:07] surrender ourself to him
[2:53:10] raise the white flag of surrender to
[2:53:13] jesus christ
[2:53:16] oh heavenly father
[2:53:24] oh what i mean it's been you from the
[2:53:26] beginning to the end
[2:53:29] it was the expectation of your children
[2:53:33] now father
[2:53:34] as we have addressed the troops here i
[2:53:38] ask you lord god that you would give
[2:53:40] them courage like never before
[2:53:43] inspire them like never before
[2:53:46] lord we ask you to refill us with your
[2:53:48] spirit dear
[2:53:50] god lord anything that's in us that's
[2:53:53] not like you we ask you
[2:53:55] that that be taken out father
[2:53:58] cleanse our minds
[2:54:00] our hearts of anything that's not like
[2:54:02] you
[2:54:04] now lord we rededicate ourselves to you
[2:54:06] father
[2:54:08] we commit ourselves to you like never
[2:54:10] before
[2:54:11] i pray for a real commandment of god
[2:54:15] may we have a love like nipple before
[2:54:17] may there come a peace like never before
[2:54:21] you're welcome holy spirit
[2:54:23] we want to wash your feet tonight with
[2:54:27] with our tears
[2:54:33] help us to forgive

[3:02:11] brother tim and i have preached to you
[3:02:13] this week
[3:02:14] [Music]
[3:02:18] he suffered as hard a trial as you can
[3:02:20] have
[3:02:21] to lose his mate
[3:02:24] he didn't stop
[3:02:28] he has a renewed challenge
[3:02:32] standing in the pulpit preaching like
[3:02:34] never before
[3:02:36] with a passion to finish this
[3:02:39] amen
[3:02:41] we've made it obvious to you and thank
[3:02:43] you for every prayer
[3:02:45] of the trial that we've been through

[3:03:07] [Music]
[3:03:10] i'd like for us to sing that last verse
[3:03:12] one more time
[3:03:13] brother branham understood
[3:03:18] you know when a writer
[3:03:22] comes from god
[3:03:25] and it those words came from god
[3:03:28] and it came from his heart
[3:03:31] he'd lived it
[3:03:34] [Music]
[3:03:36] there may be times that you feel like
[3:03:38] i'm gonna give up
[3:03:40] don't you worry
[3:03:41] there's a dub of the holy spirit
[3:03:45] if you're conscious at all the holy
[3:03:47] spirit is in this building right now
[3:03:51] and if we could finish this meeting
[3:03:53] tonight
[3:03:54] let's sing this together
[3:03:56] with all of our hearts
[3:04:07] [Music]
[3:04:10] [Applause]
[3:04:19] foreign
[3:04:20] [Music]
[3:04:29] [Music]
[3:04:33] faith was
[3:04:41] by the father above
[3:04:47] [Music]
[3:04:50] he gave me
[3:04:57] [Music]
[3:05:05] [Music]
[3:05:11] [Music]
[3:05:17] is
[3:05:29] [Music]
[3:05:43] brotherhood asked me if i wanted to
[3:05:45] share anything about that service i was
[3:05:47] in
[3:05:49] [Music]
[3:05:53] because my mind just goes back for a
[3:05:55] moment
[3:05:57] the many great things that would happen
[3:05:59] in that meeting
[3:06:01] we would go there every thanksgiving
[3:06:04] we lived right across the river in a
[3:06:06] little town called bossier
[3:06:09] and shreveport was right next to us
[3:06:12] that's where i was born
[3:06:14] because at that time bozier didn't have
[3:06:16] a hospital
[3:06:18] so just across the river
[3:06:20] my mother gave birth to me in
[3:06:23] 1954.
[3:06:25] [Music]
[3:06:26] so brother jack moore being a
[3:06:31] minister in the area we knew him and
[3:06:33] we'd learn a brother branham
[3:06:36] we'd hear of um the many wonderful works
[3:06:39] and would go to the meetings
[3:06:41] like the first meeting i would be in
[3:06:43] would be in 1956
[3:06:45] when i was only two years old and
[3:06:48] we would be out on the fairground my
[3:06:51] family would be and we would
[3:06:53] actually sort of sit on the hood of the
[3:06:55] car and we would listen to brother
[3:06:57] branham preach
[3:06:59] now we are fast forward and over into
[3:07:01] the last service the last time that
[3:07:04] i would see brother branham be in the
[3:07:06] service
[3:07:09] and brother branham would sing this song
[3:07:11] and
[3:07:12] in that service they would have an
[3:07:14] old-fashioned prayer line
[3:07:18] and in the prayer lines of that meeting
[3:07:21] there was a young girl there that
[3:07:25] also attended that meeting she actually
[3:07:27] came from a town about 50 miles away
[3:07:31] she was a
[3:07:32] methodist girl
[3:07:35] and
[3:07:36] she was a cheerleader in high school
[3:07:40] and she happened to attend that meeting
[3:07:43] too because
[3:07:45] some years before her uncle
[3:07:48] who happened to be a neighbor in the
[3:07:49] same subdivision that i
[3:07:52] lived in we played with his kids
[3:07:56] and they had um
[3:07:58] you know halloween come around and
[3:08:02] so their their kids of course and the
[3:08:05] neighborhood kids would dress up with
[3:08:08] whatever
[3:08:09] kind of halloween costume that would
[3:08:11] come around
[3:08:13] well my mother never missed an
[3:08:15] opportunity to witness
[3:08:18] so in every child's sack when a
[3:08:22] a wheel of prophecy pointing to one god
[3:08:25] [Music]
[3:08:27] dropped in every child's sack
[3:08:29] and this got home to
[3:08:32] our neighbors
[3:08:33] there and this young man with his family
[3:08:36] was
[3:08:38] studying to be a church of christ
[3:08:39] preacher
[3:08:41] [Music]
[3:08:42] and was going to be he was going to
[3:08:44] seminarian
[3:08:46] he took that track and
[3:08:48] studied it
[3:08:50] all him scriptures pointing to one god
[3:08:55] and after he
[3:08:56] after he
[3:08:58] read through all of those
[3:09:00] he light began to dawn in his heart and
[3:09:03] [Music]
[3:09:05] shortly thereafter he moved to florida
[3:09:08] and um
[3:09:10] so
[3:09:11] when he was in florida there
[3:09:14] this new venture and journey that he was
[3:09:16] on
[3:09:17] took him into the full gospel realms
[3:09:20] and now
[3:09:22] in the full gospel realms he would hear
[3:09:23] brother branham and he'd come to realize
[3:09:26] he was a prophet
[3:09:28] he was malachi 4.
[3:09:30] so he comes all the way over into
[3:09:32] louisiana from florida and
[3:09:34] stops by his sister's house in
[3:09:36] hainesville and
[3:09:38] says to his his sister and his niece
[3:09:40] said come go with me to the meeting
[3:09:42] there's a prophet in the line i want you
[3:09:44] to hear him
[3:09:46] and they were there in that meeting on
[3:09:49] the wings of the snow white dove and
[3:09:52] this young girl her name was jeannie she
[3:09:54] would become
[3:09:55] she would she's a part of my church now
[3:09:58] was
[3:09:59] wife to now
[3:10:01] to one of my deacons
[3:10:05] and sister genie was just this young
[3:10:07] girl cheerleader very whirling
[3:10:11] her husband to be which she would marry
[3:10:14] would be a football star in the
[3:10:17] there and
[3:10:18] you know they were very wrapped up in
[3:10:20] that
[3:10:21] but she had heard about this prophet and
[3:10:24] and it was an open line so anybody could
[3:10:27] go in and
[3:10:29] so they just gave everybody a card just
[3:10:31] to kind of keep it in order and but you
[3:10:33] just went through kind of a fast line
[3:10:35] and
[3:10:36] memorial times of years past
[3:10:41] and as genie came up into the line
[3:10:44] with her uncle and
[3:10:46] her mother has her
[3:10:48] her mother
[3:10:51] just ahead of them was
[3:10:55] a woman
[3:10:58] and brother branham stopped her in the
[3:10:59] prayer line this woman he said um
[3:11:02] you are desiring a great thing
[3:11:06] you're desiring a child
[3:11:09] he said
[3:11:10] but there's um
[3:11:12] a habit in your life
[3:11:14] you have been smoking
[3:11:17] and if you'll repent of that gotta give
[3:11:19] you that baby
[3:11:22] well
[3:11:24] genie about four back in the prayer line
[3:11:26] from that
[3:11:27] had been slipping around smoking herself
[3:11:32] and all of a sudden she realized that
[3:11:34] she'd come in the presence of something
[3:11:36] she had never known before
[3:11:39] they could tell the thoughts and intents
[3:11:40] of the heart know what you were doing
[3:11:43] and she began to pray god
[3:11:46] whatever you do
[3:11:49] don't let that man tell my mother i've
[3:11:52] been smoking
[3:11:55] forgive me right now lord i didn't
[3:11:57] realize how wrong that was forgive me
[3:12:01] just think
[3:12:02] four people behind this one
[3:12:06] and just that little prayer
[3:12:10] when she stepped up into
[3:12:12] that prayer line there
[3:12:14] she said brother tim there was a
[3:12:16] presence like you would never
[3:12:18] understand or could know unless you
[3:12:20] experience it the angel of god
[3:12:23] was right there with such a presence
[3:12:28] but just four people later just can you
[3:12:32] imagine how long it takes to lay hands
[3:12:36] god never revealed it at all to the
[3:12:38] prophet of god it was forgiven and under
[3:12:41] the blood
[3:12:46] so under the blood a prophet
[3:12:49] could not call it out of her life
[3:12:52] the past was gone
[3:12:54] and i want you to know
[3:12:56] he'll bring you that same kind of
[3:12:58] deliverance and i believe he's done that
[3:13:00] and these guys this meetings you got a
[3:13:02] clean past
[3:13:04] because he has signed your pardon
[3:13:07] you can go free
[3:13:09] you can walk out of here with a clean
[3:13:11] slate ahead
[3:13:13] nothing marked against you you're a
[3:13:15] child of god
[3:13:17] you're an heir of the promise
[3:13:20] amen you've been addressed tonight
[3:13:22] go forth unto battle now
[3:13:25] amen god bless you
[3:13:28] [Applause]
[3:13:29] [Music]
[3:13:30] [Applause]
[3:13:37] [Music]
[3:13:44] i believe this has been
[3:13:46] one of the greatest meetings we've ever
[3:13:48] had
[3:13:49] these meetings
[3:13:52] and i i believe it's only going to get
[3:13:54] better whatever god has for us
[3:13:57] and his brother tim was relating about
[3:13:59] that song
[3:14:01] on the wings
[3:14:03] of a dove the very meeting that he was
[3:14:05] in
[3:14:06] and you hear that prophet saying it was
[3:14:08] something he'd lived out
[3:14:15] brother ron i think it was in 2019
[3:14:20] you were just getting ready to speak a
[3:14:22] message
[3:14:24] you're getting ready to speak a message
[3:14:26] in cloverdale
[3:14:27] and you just got the report of the
[3:14:29] cancer
[3:14:31] and brother ron came out
[3:14:34] and he spoke a message
[3:14:36] and the message was entitled courage
[3:14:41] and we have seen the greatest display of
[3:14:43] courage
[3:14:46] this wasn't
[3:14:47] as brother branham would say he talked
[3:14:49] about where was that fire in louisville
[3:14:52] the louisville fire department
[3:14:54] you know is a fire out let's just you
[3:14:56] know sprinkle a little water here
[3:14:58] sprinkle a little water here that's not
[3:15:00] a captain
[3:15:02] he said a real captain
[3:15:04] takes the ax and goes up the ladder into
[3:15:07] the fire
[3:15:08] we're watching a man that has gone into
[3:15:10] the fire
[3:15:11] we're watching someone that has stood it
[3:15:14] and i'll say this god is using him like
[3:15:16] never before
[3:15:18] because i've gotten courage from him
[3:15:21] you've gotten courage for him
[3:15:23] this is not this is not just sprinkling
[3:15:26] a little water on a meeting and going to
[3:15:28] another one this is all in
[3:15:31] and i think we got to go all in
[3:15:37] [Music]
[3:15:48] we started
[3:15:50] i think a week and a half ago
[3:15:53] brother meno brother gift came through
[3:15:55] here
[3:15:56] and brother gift spoke on a wednesday
[3:15:59] night
[3:16:00] on the zeal of the father's house
[3:16:03] [Music]
[3:16:04] and we were challenged
[3:16:07] and then brother timothy came
[3:16:09] and he spoke on
[3:16:11] the day of miracles it's our turn
[3:16:15] and then we talk brother tim came and
[3:16:17] talked about the hope of our revival
[3:16:21] he asked the question i don't think it's
[3:16:23] a question anymore
[3:16:25] i believe we got the answer
[3:16:29] and brother ron spoke about in a mess
[3:16:32] but anytime god speaks it's not to leave
[3:16:35] us in that state
[3:16:37] i believe he pointed right back to the
[3:16:39] father of our faith abraham was in a
[3:16:41] mess
[3:16:42] but god stood for him
[3:16:44] that same god standing for us
[3:16:48] and he addressed the troops tonight
[3:16:51] we're gonna go out from these meetings
[3:16:54] we're gonna encounter some battles
[3:16:57] we're going to think oh i wish i was
[3:16:59] back in that meeting no
[3:17:01] i want us to take something with us some
[3:17:03] courage
[3:17:06] there's something
[3:17:08] just been on my heart
[3:17:10] i asked brother andrew this morning and
[3:17:12] we had to leave
[3:17:14] and he said the prayer line kept going
[3:17:15] and going thank you brother timothy for
[3:17:17] praying
[3:17:19] but many people
[3:17:21] were praying for lost loved ones
[3:17:24] there's something about that dove
[3:17:27] the wings of a dove
[3:17:29] it's purity
[3:17:31] but it's also a homing bird
[3:17:34] it's a bird that returns home
[3:17:38] i brother john where are you brother
[3:17:40] john
[3:17:41] i would like for you and the group that
[3:17:43] sings with you to come up
[3:17:46] and sing
[3:17:47] oh daughters of zion
[3:17:49] i'm bringing you home
[3:17:52] and i want you to think for a minute
[3:17:55] friends this is the hour
[3:17:58] jesus never would have spoke about
[3:18:00] prodigals
[3:18:02] if he knew there wouldn't be some
[3:18:05] i want to remind you when brother ron
[3:18:06] spoke
[3:18:08] here is a couple years ago
[3:18:11] and it was the service on the wings of a
[3:18:13] dove he concluded singing that song and
[3:18:16] brother ron he saw that dove
[3:18:19] there was something supernatural that
[3:18:21] happened in that meeting
[3:18:23] we had a young man actually it was one
[3:18:25] of my sons had to go
[3:18:26] and he had to go out and do something
[3:18:28] and he left his seat right in the front
[3:18:29] there wasn't a seat to be had in the
[3:18:31] house
[3:18:32] and he went in the back
[3:18:33] and logan boyer walked in the room and
[3:18:36] he sat right at the front here if you
[3:18:38] remember that
[3:18:40] brother ken that song we were singing it
[3:18:42] for brother ken
