[1:06:57] i believe also from calgary brother
[1:07:01] darren really good to see you and also i
[1:07:02] want to welcome all the local brothers
[1:07:04] ministers brother steve you've already
[1:07:06] been mentioned so you're you're supposed
[1:07:08] to be a visitor but you you're local
[1:07:10] enough that we're
[1:07:11] we're mentioning you
[1:07:13] we had a great time in the service last
[1:07:15] night
[1:07:16] i believe god was beginning to move us
[1:07:18] in a channel and in a direction
[1:07:20] i'd like you just to keep those thoughts
[1:07:22] before you and just want to remind you
[1:07:24] he's a supernatural god
[1:07:27] you cannot separate the word from the
[1:07:29] supernatural
[1:07:31] and and i believe that god is wanting to
[1:07:33] do some things
[1:07:34] and we need to put ourselves in a
[1:07:36] position for a miracle
[1:07:38] and like i said we can't manufacture it
[1:07:40] but god can make it happen
[1:07:43] and he'll work it i believe this is our
[1:07:45] turn
[1:07:47] this is our hour
[1:07:49] and i believe that god has raised us up
[1:07:52] he is preparing us for what he wants to
[1:07:54] do
[1:07:55] and i i believe there's something that's
[1:07:56] rising up
[1:07:58] and we sang that last night but i i
[1:08:00] don't believe it's just emotion i think
[1:08:02] it's it's really deep within
[1:08:06] there is something that is rising you
[1:08:08] know it's there and we're wanting god to
[1:08:11] do it and i
[1:08:12] tonight i just want to
[1:08:14] say we're going to take this a step
[1:08:15] further we're going to
[1:08:17] we're going to have our brother tim
[1:08:19] pruitt minister today
[1:08:21] i first heard brother tim
[1:08:23] in 1985
[1:08:25] in michigan that's 38 years ago
[1:08:28] and i can say one thing when you hear
[1:08:30] brother tim it'll be straight
[1:08:33] it's going to be the gospel
[1:08:35] without compromise
[1:08:37] and i and i say
[1:08:38] a real christian wants it that way
[1:08:41] and i i would just say if anything
[1:08:43] there's only been a maturing
[1:08:45] and uh we we've
[1:08:48] we've appreciated brother tim and the
[1:08:50] ministry over the years
[1:08:52] and and i i believe it as brother
[1:08:54] branham would say i think it was in
[1:08:56] questions and answers
[1:08:58] they they asked him will the bride have
[1:09:00] a ministry
[1:09:02] and and he said oh
[1:09:04] that's what's going on right now
[1:09:06] and he said it consists of
[1:09:08] prophets and apostles and pastors and
[1:09:11] evangelists and teachers
[1:09:13] it'll be a great ministry
[1:09:16] it's the ministry of the
[1:09:18] hour and it'll be
[1:09:21] so humble
[1:09:22] because it's not a minister lifting
[1:09:24] himself up but it's a minister
[1:09:26] under the anointing of a mighty angel
[1:09:29] lifting up christ
[1:09:31] the word made known in this hour and i
[1:09:34] believe as
[1:09:35] if you could have looked down in time i
[1:09:37] believe brother tim was part of that
[1:09:38] group
[1:09:39] i believe these brothers were part of
[1:09:40] that group i believe there's other
[1:09:42] brothers
[1:09:43] that were part of that group
[1:09:45] and i want to say brother tim is
[1:09:47] experienced he's well-versed
[1:09:50] in the bible in the message of the hour
[1:09:53] and he also has an awareness of where
[1:09:55] we're at
[1:09:56] and i i believe that god is
[1:09:58] going to move him and use him and let's
[1:10:00] just be in that channel
[1:10:02] i'm going to just change the order a
[1:10:03] little bit i just want to remind you
[1:10:05] tomorrow we have a full day we have a
[1:10:08] for the ministers that are here we're
[1:10:09] going to have a breakfast in the morning
[1:10:10] if you haven't been invited and you want
[1:10:12] to do just come see me after the service
[1:10:14] if you're a minister and we're not going
[1:10:16] to ordain you to be a part of the
[1:10:18] breakfast don't worry you're only going
[1:10:20] to be if you're established minister
[1:10:22] okay is that right
[1:10:23] and we've got that in the afternoon
[1:10:25] we've got a youth service at 1 30
[1:10:28] and so they'll be here brother timothy
[1:10:30] pruitt will be speaking
[1:10:31] tomorrow night our brother ron spencer
[1:10:33] is going to speak six o'clock tomorrow
[1:10:35] and i believe we're building to what
[1:10:36] god's going to do more and more
[1:10:38] and uh so we're just looking forward to
[1:10:41] what the lord has let's just sing he

[1:15:25] near brother harold's birthday or
[1:15:27] perhaps it was on his birthday i text
[1:15:29] him and wished him a happy birthday and
[1:15:32] it was there he asked me to come to be
[1:15:34] in this meeting
[1:15:35] and to minister he had been working
[1:15:38] in conjunction with brother hamer
[1:15:40] meister for me to come and to accompany
[1:15:43] brother um brother ron spencer
[1:15:46] and uh to be with you in these special
[1:15:48] meetings that he has ministered here now
[1:15:51] for a number of years
[1:15:53] and um so you know to to get to come and
[1:15:56] to be is here together with him is
[1:15:58] really special and
[1:16:00] amen it's a it's a dream it's uh it's a
[1:16:03] it's a joy to be together with you
[1:16:04] brother ron and the these two men are my
[1:16:07] heroes
[1:16:10] i'll tell you what um it's a privilege
[1:16:12] to work together with my son i told
[1:16:14] brother hemmermeister when he when he
[1:16:17] asked me to come and confirm the the um
[1:16:20] the request to come that brother harold
[1:16:22] had given i said well
[1:16:24] i guess you know you get two
[1:16:26] with in in the package because i don't
[1:16:29] i don't come without my son
[1:16:31] and uh i used to of course travel with
[1:16:34] my wife she's been going on to the lord
[1:16:36] be with the lord now nearly a year ago
[1:16:39] but my son's been traveling with me when
[1:16:41] i go
[1:16:42] but um we're we're here to serve the
[1:16:45] great king of glory and worship the lord
[1:16:47] together with you
[1:16:49] amen so it's good to be here with you
[1:16:52] i think about it my first time to speak
[1:16:54] in edmonton i was only 34 at the
[1:16:58] at the 1988 um
[1:17:01] convention that you hosted and put on
[1:17:03] this church has always been a mission
[1:17:06] missionary-minded church and had invited
[1:17:09] ministry from around the world and i was
[1:17:12] privileged to be able to speak in that
[1:17:14] convention and and uh now
[1:17:17] here we are 34 years later and we're
[1:17:20] still pressing on
[1:17:22] amen we're here in this meeting tonight
[1:17:25] i believe because it god has ordained
[1:17:28] this moment
[1:17:29] so we're stepping right into the vision
[1:17:32] of god's uh
[1:17:34] ordained plan for us right here at this
[1:17:36] hour
[1:17:37] and so as we do it i just want you to
[1:17:40] turn your attention to the lord and let
[1:17:42] him speak to you
[1:17:44] let him reveal himself to you in a very
[1:17:46] special way
[1:17:48] because god is real and he wants to make
[1:17:50] himself real to you
[1:17:53] amen so i trust that he will do that
[1:17:55] tonight i know he will
[1:17:57] because i'm i'm standing here
[1:18:00] before a portion of the bride of christ
[1:18:03] and i think of where paul admonished us
[1:18:06] by the holy spirit you know for our
[1:18:08] wives to for the husbands to show their
[1:18:11] wife a due benevolence
[1:18:13] and to minister to their needs and to
[1:18:16] see to their desires in their heart now
[1:18:20] god couldn't tell
[1:18:22] us men to do that
[1:18:24] and then him be a husband and not keep
[1:18:27] his own word
[1:18:29] so therefore if you've got a need here
[1:18:31] tonight
[1:18:33] he's husband enough
[1:18:35] to come by your way
[1:18:37] to minister to your need he's a personal
[1:18:40] god and he wants to minister personally
[1:18:43] to you tonight
[1:18:45] you got a need in your heart in life
[1:18:47] let's just take it to him right now as
[1:18:49] we pray
[1:18:50] you just hold it before the lord jesus
[1:18:54] i'm so needy of you
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] the song says i can't find the way alone
[1:19:02] lord we can't do anything without you
[1:19:05] but without you we are nothing
[1:19:09] lord
[1:19:10] i stand here as a mere mortal
[1:19:14] and i know it takes your anointing i
[1:19:16] know it takes the power of the holy
[1:19:18] spirit
[1:19:19] to get into the word and make it live
[1:19:24] lord before mere fragments of thoughts
[1:19:26] that i have penned and
[1:19:28] the scriptures and quotations that i
[1:19:31] have collected and
[1:19:33] put together in what we call a sermon
[1:19:37] but lord his sermon must be god breathed
[1:19:41] it must be anointed
[1:19:44] and these fragments of paper or thoughts
[1:19:47] that we append
[1:19:49] they're just
[1:19:50] they're just
[1:19:52] scattered like on a sea of
[1:19:56] can be blown around by the wind or this
[1:19:59] or that and man's ideas
[1:20:01] but lord if you'll come
[1:20:04] if you'll come and you'll just gather

[1:28:17] lord give us all thy blessings and make
[1:28:20] this the greatest convention that's been
[1:28:22] here yet
[1:28:24] because we ask it in christ's name
[1:28:26] i think that prayer is good here for
[1:28:28] tonight
[1:28:30] let it be the greatest convention that
[1:28:32] there's been yet
[1:28:34] tonight i want to speak on a subject of
[1:28:37] is there hope for revival
[1:28:41] you know today it's somewhat
[1:28:43] questionable in the mind of many as to
[1:28:45] whether we can even have a revival
[1:28:48] uh you know revival's over brother tim
[1:28:51] and there's just no hope for revival
[1:28:53] after the word's been revealed and we're
[1:28:55] just to settle down in our churches and
[1:28:58] instead of instead of being under a
[1:29:01] baptist or methodist or pentecostal
[1:29:03] label we just take on a new label of
[1:29:06] being under a message banner
[1:29:09] but i want to say we have not come to
[1:29:11] this land of the open book
[1:29:14] to the restored word just to settle down
[1:29:17] and to have churches under a new name
[1:29:20] with new doctrines
[1:29:21] but we have returned to the land of the
[1:29:24] bible
[1:29:25] to welcome back the messiah
[1:29:28] amen and we cannot do that encumbered
[1:29:31] with the spirit of laodicea and without
[1:29:34] the spirit of revival
[1:29:36] and this is a rapture age and the very
[1:29:40] word rapture means intense pleasure or
[1:29:43] enthusiasm
[1:29:45] i tell you if we are people of the
[1:29:47] rapture we should be a people who take
[1:29:50] great pleasure
[1:29:51] in serving god with a great enthusiasm
[1:29:56] for the truth that we have received
[1:29:59] now we know this is a laodicean age and
[1:30:02] and we've already had in this age great
[1:30:05] stirrings of the holy spirit why the age
[1:30:08] would begin with the azusa street
[1:30:10] revival in 1906
[1:30:12] and then in 1946 the angel of god came
[1:30:15] to brother branham who was instructed to
[1:30:18] take a message of divine healing
[1:30:21] to the world
[1:30:23] and then that sparked the great divine
[1:30:25] healing revivals of the 40s and the 50s
[1:30:29] and and you sometimes wonder what was
[1:30:32] that revival like
[1:30:34] and the message influenced brother
[1:30:36] branham lets us know he said i as he was
[1:30:39] in beaumont texas speaking that said i
[1:30:41] was here with my old friend brother
[1:30:43] bosworth and raymond ritchie and many of
[1:30:46] the brethren i still believe the same
[1:30:49] gospel hadn't changed a bit just the
[1:30:52] same but you see the revival was going
[1:30:54] on then and where there's no revival you
[1:30:57] just can't get things done
[1:31:00] the ministry is far more advanced it was
[1:31:02] only telling you then that this would
[1:31:04] come and how many remembers that sure
[1:31:06] you're doing it and come just exactly
[1:31:08] like it said it would i and then i'd
[1:31:10] take my hand the people and lay my hands
[1:31:13] upon them i told them i told you what he
[1:31:15] told me and that's just the way it
[1:31:17] happened it's just exactly it never
[1:31:19] failed to be the truth each and every
[1:31:20] time
[1:31:21] so it has to come from god no one could
[1:31:24] doubt it but you see the revival is not
[1:31:27] owned
[1:31:28] you just your presence adjust your
[1:31:31] presence to walk in the in with the
[1:31:33] people while the people would get up off
[1:31:36] of their cots and stretchers and walk
[1:31:38] around you just lay hands on them and
[1:31:40] mother just sent them a whirling and
[1:31:43] i've seen lions would be three or four
[1:31:44] or 500 people come through the lines
[1:31:48] deaf dumb blind cross side not one of
[1:31:50] them would fail but would be healed
[1:31:52] every one of them
[1:31:53] but try it today there's no fire
[1:31:56] in rome when the fires went out in the
[1:31:58] temple in vista the people went home you
[1:32:02] see there's now there's no revival fire
[1:32:05] to back it up
[1:32:06] see that it's just it and and after a
[1:32:09] while if the world stands they'll start
[1:32:11] living in the glare again
[1:32:14] and that's the way it's always been
[1:32:16] passed over and missed them and that
[1:32:18] generations be judged for what passed
[1:32:20] over them and they failed to see it
[1:32:23] jesus christ is alive this afternoon
[1:32:26] he's walking around with us now
[1:32:28] he's ever present where two or more are
[1:32:30] gathered in my name i am there in the
[1:32:33] midst
[1:32:34] believe that won't you now you know and
[1:32:37] i wonder today sometimes how much many
[1:32:40] are living in the glare again of a past
[1:32:43] move of god
[1:32:45] and yet have no revival fire today
[1:32:49] missing something that is very necessary
[1:32:53] he says he speaks again in denim springs
[1:32:56] louisiana and this is again a 1964
[1:32:58] quotation he said we just witnessed one
[1:33:01] of the greatest revivals i believe that
[1:33:04] the world has ever seen this last 10 15
[1:33:06] years been revival not like the days of
[1:33:10] billy sunday or the days of welsh
[1:33:12] revival or days of the wesley revival
[1:33:15] and moody revival billy sunday revival
[1:33:17] it's been a worldwide sweeping affair
[1:33:20] around the world great healing services
[1:33:24] great revival fires have burnt
[1:33:27] practically on every hill in the world
[1:33:30] right tonight way over in the lands of
[1:33:32] africa china japan this gospel being
[1:33:35] preached and people are being healed
[1:33:36] right this very minute around and around
[1:33:39] the world has been one of the greatest
[1:33:40] revivals because i believe it's it's one
[1:33:44] of the last revivals this world will see
[1:33:46] a world sweep and revival
[1:33:49] but now in the last few years is
[1:33:51] quieting down
[1:33:52] and you don't notice the enthusiasm in
[1:33:55] the people that used to be
[1:33:57] i remember having the privilege by the
[1:33:59] holy spirit to spearhead that revival
[1:34:02] that started um there when the angel
[1:34:04] lord appeared on the river and said that
[1:34:06] many years ago and see it happen and see
[1:34:08] ministers hearts of fire
[1:34:11] everywhere and revivals broke out why
[1:34:13] you could just walk into the building
[1:34:16] and people would get up out of their
[1:34:17] carts cots and stretchers and walk away
[1:34:20] healed you didn't have to say a word
[1:34:23] just being there was all it took
[1:34:25] and i remember one night in vandalia
[1:34:28] illinois i walked in the media and had
[1:34:29] no more been in the meeting around five
[1:34:32] mil over five minutes and there wasn't a
[1:34:34] feeble person around that place anywhere
[1:34:37] wheelchairs pushed out and piled up
[1:34:40] blind was seeing deaf and dumb speaking
[1:34:43] just simply the holy spirit of the lord
[1:34:45] was present and he just healed the whole
[1:34:48] group of them
[1:34:49] now
[1:34:50] that's when you can do something
[1:34:53] when revival is going on
[1:34:56] but let the revival fire die down then
[1:34:59] you can hardly now watch this the people
[1:35:02] are still christians
[1:35:03] but they're not revived into that spirit
[1:35:06] that great atmosphere that does
[1:35:09] something
[1:35:10] it's just like in a forge in a
[1:35:12] blacksmith shop you've done got to get
[1:35:14] it the iron hot before you go to pound
[1:35:17] it on it in the anvil if you don't
[1:35:19] you'll never straighten it out and
[1:35:21] that's what it takes to have a revival
[1:35:23] is everyone under the heat of the holy
[1:35:26] spirit that's brought down the powers of
[1:35:29] god and revival movement then there's
[1:35:31] prayer meetings going on day and night
[1:35:33] and every minute everywhere while the
[1:35:35] people wouldn't even leave the grounds
[1:35:39] and of course we know that was the
[1:35:41] divine healing
[1:35:43] revival and and brother branham would
[1:35:46] announce to us it is over it is finished
[1:35:50] and again it did come to an end
[1:35:52] and there was things that caused the
[1:35:54] ending of that revival
[1:35:57] and we want to talk about how that you
[1:36:00] know some killers of revival
[1:36:03] and what it takes there to have revival
[1:36:05] again
[1:36:07] now
[1:36:08] and is there even a revival left that is
[1:36:11] promised for us in this last day or have
[1:36:15] we seen our last revival
[1:36:17] and and then we look at the divine
[1:36:19] healing revival and and
[1:36:22] and asked the question did it even bring
[1:36:25] the promised rapture
[1:36:27] that was desired and
[1:36:30] or did it just make bigger denominations
[1:36:35] and and add more members as brother
[1:36:37] branham said i i sent three quarters of
[1:36:39] a million of my children to the assembly
[1:36:42] of god and others went to oneness and
[1:36:44] full gospel
[1:36:46] and brother branham talks about this in
[1:36:48] the message paul a prisoner and he talks
[1:36:50] about how that moses
[1:36:52] you know he he took him out in the
[1:36:54] desert and he kept him out there for 40
[1:36:57] years
[1:36:58] and there god stripped him of all his
[1:37:00] theology and his ambition
[1:37:04] where he could look back and he could
[1:37:06] see his failure
[1:37:08] and how tonight we ought to do the same
[1:37:10] thing when we see our ambition
[1:37:14] look at the divine healing campaign and
[1:37:16] see if the lord didn't do something a
[1:37:18] few years ago to start healing restore
[1:37:21] restoring healing to the sick and so
[1:37:23] forth everybody every organization is
[1:37:26] because it didn't come to their
[1:37:28] organization they had to get them a
[1:37:30] healer
[1:37:32] you see
[1:37:33] see again in that revival a revival
[1:37:36] killer began when men began to rise up
[1:37:40] who were only really truly interested in
[1:37:43] kingdom buildings
[1:37:48] now what have we done he said we've done
[1:37:50] the same thing that moses did we went
[1:37:53] out and tried so hard to manufacture a
[1:37:55] miracle i smelt a disease i got blood in
[1:37:58] my hand manufacturer miracle and what
[1:38:01] have we got some men and went into hard
[1:38:03] strains and broke up become regular
[1:38:05] drunkards and neurotics and got their
[1:38:08] minds switched all the way back the
[1:38:10] order from the pentecostal objective
[1:38:12] back to making organizations again and
[1:38:14] things you see
[1:38:16] you see they they took that moment of
[1:38:18] revival and built their kingdom bigger
[1:38:23] you had men that would get in the
[1:38:25] ministry and they had to have their
[1:38:27] their gift it would be their ministry
[1:38:30] and they're going to be the man of the
[1:38:32] hour
[1:38:33] you have a a allen who died a drunk and
[1:38:35] old jaggers who tried every gimmick to
[1:38:38] keep in the limelight and all roberts
[1:38:40] who prophesied of a 900 foot tall jesus
[1:38:44] who told him that you know to raise
[1:38:46] millions of dollars or god would kill
[1:38:48] him and he died in a condition of of you
[1:38:52] know in in shame
[1:38:55] that he brought to the whole movement of
[1:38:58] the divine healing
[1:39:00] movement there and and so brother
[1:39:02] brandon said what have we done in other
[1:39:04] words what does it accomplish we slew
[1:39:07] about one egyptian
[1:39:09] you see that's what we tried we strained
[1:39:11] we paid we've labored we go all night in
[1:39:14] prayer meetings and we until we had no
[1:39:16] voice we tried to manufacture something
[1:39:18] and soup up something and all these
[1:39:21] types of things and find it to be a
[1:39:23] total failure
[1:39:25] he said we need to go have a going back
[1:39:27] to the desert
[1:39:29] well yes he said camp meetings and
[1:39:31] struggles why not just give up
[1:39:33] that's what you ought to do just go back
[1:39:35] and give up what we have done the same
[1:39:37] thing that moses did it doesn't do any
[1:39:40] good after 40 years he found himself a
[1:39:42] prisoner
[1:39:43] to the word of god
[1:39:45] what do we try to do he said when that
[1:39:47] great blessing came out and the
[1:39:50] manifestation of the great things that
[1:39:52] god had told us about how we must be
[1:39:54] born again how we must receive the holy
[1:39:57] ghost the baptism in the name of jesus
[1:40:00] christ all of these things instead of
[1:40:02] people staying to that word and harness
[1:40:05] to it what did they do they started
[1:40:07] their own denominational theory
[1:40:10] which had already failed and tried to
[1:40:12] manufacture something that looked like
[1:40:14] the truth
[1:40:16] and he said what have we got tonight a
[1:40:18] nation full of organized people who deny
[1:40:22] the scriptures of god who would call the
[1:40:25] life of the holy spirit is a mental
[1:40:27] telepathy who would refuse it to come in
[1:40:30] their church and they wouldn't permit
[1:40:32] you to mention one word of serpent seed
[1:40:35] or eternal security on the things that
[1:40:37] the holy spirit has revealed and proved
[1:40:39] to be the word i may challenge after
[1:40:41] challenge to come and prove it to me
[1:40:43] wrong and what have they done the same
[1:40:45] that luther had the rest of them flew an
[1:40:47] egyptian what was it maybe
[1:40:50] made some man stop stealing
[1:40:54] or maybe live true to his wife but then
[1:40:57] what do you make out of him a church
[1:40:59] member
[1:41:02] come and join our group
[1:41:04] and that stinking dead man was the only
[1:41:08] thing he could point his finger to
[1:41:11] it was a success of 40 years of training
[1:41:14] a stinking egyptian laying there rotten
[1:41:17] and dead and he said that's the way it
[1:41:18] is tonight the only thing we can point
[1:41:20] to in this revival that's crossed over
[1:41:23] so-called is a stinking bunch of church
[1:41:26] members that know
[1:41:28] no more about god than a hot dog but
[1:41:30] know about an egyptian night right
[1:41:32] telling them about the word of god i say
[1:41:34] i don't believe that and say i don't
[1:41:37] care what they say i don't believe it
[1:41:38] that's a awful thing to have to be a
[1:41:41] point back to
[1:41:42] for all the strains and the struggles
[1:41:45] and everything we've got maybe we could
[1:41:47] point to a big school but it's dead we
[1:41:50] could point to an organization but it's
[1:41:52] dead it is thinking it's just like the
[1:41:55] first thing we pulled out of like a hog
[1:41:58] going this wall or dog just vomit when
[1:42:00] we return back one dead egyptian
[1:42:06] and i just want to say that's not what
[1:42:08] the message was sent to produce
[1:42:12] it's was set to produce a rapture
[1:42:15] and a people with faith for a rapture
[1:42:18] a people of the promise
[1:42:21] a people who know their god who just
[1:42:23] exploits
[1:42:25] a people who has a life a drive a
[1:42:28] passion a burden
[1:42:31] something down on the inside not a not
[1:42:33] just a bunch of stinking dead church
[1:42:36] members
[1:42:37] men and women you know that maybe they
[1:42:39] live through their husband or maybe they
[1:42:42] pay tithes to the church or maybe they
[1:42:44] quit stealing and we made a good
[1:42:46] citizen for canada
[1:42:48] that's not what the message was to
[1:42:50] produce
[1:42:51] it's not just to produce another bunch
[1:42:54] of denominational
[1:42:56] chickens
[1:42:57] amen it's to produce eagles who soar in
[1:43:00] the heavens where all things are
[1:43:02] possible to them that believe
[1:43:05] now out of that movement to begin with
[1:43:08] the revival at azusa street and the
[1:43:11] divine healing revival you know there
[1:43:13] are now
[1:43:15] 644 million
[1:43:18] pentecostals and charismatics worldwide
[1:43:22] including all the members of
[1:43:24] pentecostalism there are 19
[1:43:27] 300 denominations and fellowships
[1:43:31] so that's what it all created
[1:43:36] amen
[1:43:38] 0.6 billion
[1:43:42] over half a billion
[1:43:44] people who claim
[1:43:47] azusa street
[1:43:48] as their roots
[1:43:51] and think about it again you know 19 300
[1:43:56] denominations and fellowships
[1:43:59] for god's sake how in the world did they
[1:44:01] get so divided they could make 19 300 of
[1:44:05] them
[1:44:09] so you know and and so we we ask the
[1:44:11] question what would even another divine
[1:44:14] healing movement produce
[1:44:17] what about america would she ever have
[1:44:20] another revival
[1:44:22] you know we had men raised up among the
[1:44:25] evangelicals and you know
[1:44:28] with jerry falwell is moral majority
[1:44:30] there ain't no moral majority
[1:44:33] i don't know what you got in canada and
[1:44:35] all about your politics but there is not
[1:44:38] a moral majority in america
[1:44:41] there's an immoral majority
[1:44:45] i tell you today you are an endangered
[1:44:47] species
[1:44:48] [Applause]
[1:44:50] amen
[1:44:51] you are in a minority
[1:44:54] and even even
[1:44:56] even even today the conservatives are
[1:44:59] yesterday's liberals
[1:45:02] there's no such thing as a true
[1:45:04] conservative except the bride of jesus
[1:45:07] christ
[1:45:08] and america has become a godless nation
[1:45:11] who has now turned from lamb with
[1:45:13] freedom of religion to a dragon a beast
[1:45:16] that devours
[1:45:18] amen it's a spirit of lawlessness that
[1:45:21] has taken over our country
[1:45:24] defend the police
[1:45:26] have you ever heard of such a thing in
[1:45:27] your life you know rioting in the street
[1:45:30] with sodomites screaming for the rights
[1:45:33] to kill their children
[1:45:36] can you imagine that but it's not just
[1:45:39] america it's the insanity is going on
[1:45:42] around the world
[1:45:44] sodom is no longer a city sodom is not
[1:45:48] just one country
[1:45:49] son of sodom is a world we are living in
[1:45:52] a sodom world
[1:45:58] branham talks about this and is your
[1:45:59] life worthy of the gospel he said they
[1:46:01] were invited to a feast
[1:46:05] and he said america there had been
[1:46:07] invited to he feast he said england had
[1:46:09] a chance at revival and he's saying then
[1:46:12] he you talked about how that they had
[1:46:14] been weakened to the sex of women until
[1:46:17] spies would come in usually using that
[1:46:20] and their sin of scandals of the
[1:46:22] government has so disgrace their
[1:46:25] disgrateful name across the world now
[1:46:27] this is 1963 it sounds like i'm reading
[1:46:30] from prophecy that are things he's
[1:46:32] saying right now
[1:46:34] and man she's rejected the truth she had
[1:46:37] she had her excuses she made excuses
[1:46:40] why not to come to the feast and she's
[1:46:43] finished
[1:46:44] she's washed up
[1:46:46] america
[1:46:47] 15 years ago when the great divine
[1:46:49] healing revival continued on from
[1:46:51] pentecost
[1:46:52] broke out in the nations
[1:46:54] and there was a revivals on the capitol
[1:46:57] washington dc the president vice
[1:46:59] presidents great people governors great
[1:47:02] things taking place
[1:47:04] and and men healed like cover
[1:47:07] congressman upshaw had been a
[1:47:09] for 66 years and they could not turn
[1:47:12] their face and say it wasn't so it was
[1:47:15] right before them
[1:47:17] and tonight that's the reason this
[1:47:19] nation stays she's doomed there is no
[1:47:21] hope for it
[1:47:23] she has crossed the line between
[1:47:25] judgment and mercy she's elected what
[1:47:27] she has in here to control the nation
[1:47:30] and now since 63 we've done the same
[1:47:33] thing we've got another catholic
[1:47:34] president
[1:47:38] i mean just the pope just happened to
[1:47:40] come to apologize to the first nation
[1:47:42] people for for slavery and and for
[1:47:45] abusing and murder and and raping and
[1:47:48] and mistreating people have to apologize
[1:47:54] i'll tell you what friends
[1:47:56] we have no such apologies to make
[1:47:59] the gospel we have preached have
[1:48:00] delivered men and women from slavery
[1:48:03] from sin
[1:48:05] from unbelief from darkness
[1:48:08] hallelujah amen we need not make an
[1:48:11] apology for the blood of jesus christ
[1:48:14] for the power of god under salvation
[1:48:17] amen we need not make a an excuse or
[1:48:20] apology to see young men and young women
[1:48:23] get filled with the holy ghost and
[1:48:25] become real daddies and real mamas
[1:48:33] but you see
[1:48:35] america
[1:48:36] she's elected what she has in
[1:48:39] men
[1:48:40] men of corrupt minds
[1:48:43] here we we saw brother branham could
[1:48:46] could never make it out exactly right he
[1:48:48] said it could be in the catholic church
[1:48:50] it could be some woman as president or
[1:48:52] vice president it was both of them
[1:48:57] we elected a catholic president at the
[1:48:59] same time a woman
[1:49:00] we're right here in the fulfillment of
[1:49:02] prophecy
[1:49:05] who is pushing down upon the world a
[1:49:07] liberal world order
[1:49:10] of sodomy
[1:49:11] of sin
[1:49:13] of evil
[1:49:14] of a dragon rising up
[1:49:17] with the spirit and the nature of the
[1:49:19] devil
[1:49:21] demon possessed men and women
[1:49:24] who are under a spirit of insanity and
[1:49:28] america can never have a revival
[1:49:31] and the world will never have a revival
[1:49:35] amen the holy spirit was poured out upon
[1:49:38] russia very even and they were called to
[1:49:41] the feast of pentecost you can read this
[1:49:43] in their in their very history in the in
[1:49:46] the days before azusa the holy spirit
[1:49:48] fell upon them and then ukraine and
[1:49:51] those people there moved out into the
[1:49:53] states and were part of the azusa
[1:49:55] movement and whatever she was offered
[1:49:58] and called the to the feast of pentecost
[1:50:01] a spiritual feast and they turned it
[1:50:03] down
[1:50:05] england was given their chance
[1:50:07] america has been given their chance
[1:50:10] amen and but he said i believe maybe
[1:50:13] within the next and he said the table is
[1:50:16] ready there is still room
[1:50:19] the table's got to be set
[1:50:21] go and compel those people to come in
[1:50:24] and i believe maybe within the next or
[1:50:26] month or something a year or whatever it
[1:50:29] is god is going to send another shaking
[1:50:33] across the country for there's somebody
[1:50:35] out there still somewhere that's a
[1:50:38] predestinated seed that that light has
[1:50:41] to fall on somewhere somewhere in the
[1:50:43] world the nation is gone
[1:50:47] but god is still calling seed
[1:50:51] hallelujah and i believe there's seed in
[1:50:54] this meeting
[1:50:57] hallelujah i believe there are those
[1:51:00] that have been
[1:51:01] a wayward and away from god that god is
[1:51:04] calling back home
[1:51:07] i believe there is a pride that has been
[1:51:10] received a call come back to the land
[1:51:12] come back to the promise of the lord get
[1:51:15] back in step
[1:51:16] [Applause]
[1:51:19] amen you can give me just a little more
[1:51:21] sound up here
[1:51:23] now we know of a certain
[1:51:25] that we cannot
[1:51:27] reproduce the azusa revival and neither
[1:51:31] should we try
[1:51:33] and neither should we try to reproduce
[1:51:35] another divine healing revival
[1:51:38] or any other worldwide sweeping revival
[1:51:40] that accomplished
[1:51:42] you know the great feat of adding
[1:51:44] billions of people to come to the cause
[1:51:48] for the past hundred years
[1:51:51] the charismatics the pentecostals have
[1:51:54] tried
[1:51:55] to breathe
[1:51:57] new revival and breathe life into new
[1:52:00] revival fires into that movement and
[1:52:03] they're blown and blown and blown upon
[1:52:06] the ashes of that revival
[1:52:09] with the only results being the soot
[1:52:12] of the pacifiers blocking in their face
[1:52:17] and we know you know even even there are
[1:52:20] many there that are trying to do god as
[1:52:22] service without his will
[1:52:24] pray now and call on god and surely
[1:52:27] america come back she won't
[1:52:31] her revival is pastor
[1:52:34] and there are those who say like they
[1:52:35] did to brother branham in that day where
[1:52:37] we can only have revival if we take the
[1:52:40] word or word by word page by page letter
[1:52:42] by pa letter and
[1:52:44] and we got to find the right in greek
[1:52:47] interpretation and
[1:52:49] and brother branham said
[1:52:50] himself i hadn't read too much but
[1:52:52] reading the history of the church and
[1:52:54] the nicene council on the pre-night
[1:52:56] seeing council and nicean fathers they
[1:52:58] were arguing all back there about the
[1:53:00] greek and that's been 2 000 years ago
[1:53:03] and it means this and others said it
[1:53:04] means that and this greek word says it
[1:53:07] means that
[1:53:08] what it is
[1:53:10] what happened
[1:53:11] we have built over 40 000 denominations
[1:53:15] off of one bible
[1:53:18] there's over 40 000 denomination
[1:53:21] christian denominations in the world
[1:53:23] today
[1:53:24] each one's saying they are the way
[1:53:27] or the one bible
[1:53:29] i wonder how many denominations we can
[1:53:31] build off of 1100 tapes
[1:53:38] you see
[1:53:39] again you know we we got to we got to
[1:53:42] look back and see what god has promised
[1:53:45] as he said a revival will never come
[1:53:48] until god the sovereign god sends it
[1:53:52] and he might take a little nitwit they
[1:53:54] can't sign his name
[1:53:57] amen because god is not known by how
[1:53:59] well he speaks the english or how well
[1:54:02] he knows the greek or well he got this
[1:54:04] interpretation right he's he's known by
[1:54:07] the spirit of god the power of the holy
[1:54:10] ghost
[1:54:11] and my men like peter who couldn't sign
[1:54:14] their own name
[1:54:16] they were ignorant and unlearned but you
[1:54:18] knew this one thing about it they had
[1:54:20] been with jesus
[1:54:23] amen
[1:54:24] and he says now if there's anybody got
[1:54:27] mechanics for revival it's our noble
[1:54:29] brother and billy graham the mechanics
[1:54:32] is all right but the mechanics won't
[1:54:34] move it it takes the dynamics to move it
[1:54:38] you can build an automobile you put fine
[1:54:41] seats in it you can make fine pistons
[1:54:43] and you can prove by science what it can
[1:54:45] do but unless the dynamics is there
[1:54:48] she's just a dead piece of goods
[1:54:52] so in the welsh revival he said he spoke
[1:54:54] he said no one knew what started that
[1:54:56] revival it was a sovereign move
[1:54:59] and then he said our friend billy graham
[1:55:01] and them they'll go and they'll they'll
[1:55:04] have a meeting and thousands have come
[1:55:06] to the altar and he said you know what
[1:55:08] one year later you can't even find one
[1:55:11] you see because it does never inoculate
[1:55:14] him from sin
[1:55:16] amen but let god and his sovereign grace
[1:55:19] speak to some little nitwit
[1:55:22] elsa say a little nobody and let his
[1:55:24] spirit fall into a city and a man can go
[1:55:27] i can't go to work a woman can't wash
[1:55:30] the dishes the maid can't make the bed
[1:55:32] of screaming and crying with their hands
[1:55:35] up in the air that's revival in the will
[1:55:38] of god
[1:55:40] amen and he said that sovereign that's
[1:55:42] what god does he alone has a right to
[1:55:45] sin revival
[1:55:48] not just get the mechanics together is
[1:55:50] pray for god to send the dynamics
[1:55:55] but you know so many of the message
[1:55:57] community are void of the dynamics
[1:56:00] all they have is a biligram type of
[1:56:03] mechanics
[1:56:06] even the conversion it is offered is a
[1:56:09] billy graham type
[1:56:11] conversion of easy believism
[1:56:15] billy graham would help thousands who
[1:56:17] would
[1:56:17] respond to the pleas
[1:56:19] come up and receive christ as your lord
[1:56:22] of your life and confess i'm a sinner
[1:56:25] and i accept christ as my savior
[1:56:27] and he found that most of them didn't
[1:56:29] stick
[1:56:31] he could come back after thirty thousand
[1:56:33] had pledged to receive christ come back
[1:56:35] a year later couldn't find ten it stayed
[1:56:38] true and he blamed it on lazy preachers
[1:56:41] but brother branham said that that
[1:56:43] wasn't the problem
[1:56:45] the problem wasn't lazy preachers
[1:56:47] the problem was he didn't take him far
[1:56:49] enough
[1:56:52] and today it's not come up and accept
[1:56:55] jesus since even altar calls are now
[1:56:58] frowned upon
[1:57:00] so just sit tight in your seat
[1:57:03] and accept the message and believe
[1:57:05] brother branham is your prophet and and
[1:57:07] if you believe that you've got the holy
[1:57:09] ghost
[1:57:10] and i would call that the new birth is
[1:57:12] blasphemy
[1:57:14] amen no wonder we got a bunch of
[1:57:16] a bunch of rotten eggs in the nest
[1:57:20] we got men and women who have never been
[1:57:22] with the mate jesus christ
[1:57:26] you say brother tim i'm a predestinated
[1:57:28] seed but that seed has to be germinated
[1:57:31] by the holy ghost
[1:57:34] and that takes an experience of
[1:57:36] something that light the fire down on
[1:57:38] the inside
[1:57:41] amen
[1:57:43] brother harold always had this statement
[1:57:45] that he always would say he said this
[1:57:48] message cannot be passed on
[1:57:49] intellectually
[1:57:52] and this is why there are so many seeds
[1:57:55] today that have fallen along the wayside
[1:57:58] and among thorns
[1:58:00] those seeds were those sown among thorns
[1:58:03] a long path they never reach fruition
[1:58:06] they perish
[1:58:08] they never produce the the promised
[1:58:10] harvest and brother branham said that's
[1:58:12] the way many people does about coming to
[1:58:15] christ they laid the foundation of
[1:58:17] believing on the lord jesus and
[1:58:19] accepting this personal savior and maybe
[1:58:22] going on to
[1:58:24] a christian baptism but when it comes to
[1:58:27] following on through
[1:58:29] to the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:58:32] somebody explains it away for them and
[1:58:34] that's the reason that seed fell by the
[1:58:37] wayside or fell on stony grounds
[1:58:44] so this brings us
[1:58:46] to the cycle of revival and death
[1:58:53] and you see this is where he would say
[1:58:56] to the first stage i've got something
[1:58:58] what against you
[1:59:00] because you left your first love
[1:59:04] and so you got to understand he was not
[1:59:07] just speaking to the ephesus church but
[1:59:10] this message that he was speaking he was
[1:59:12] it would speak to the entire age
[1:59:15] and and he said he goes on he talks
[1:59:17] about the revival that was with in the
[1:59:20] generations of israel you see revival in
[1:59:22] one generation and then only see the
[1:59:25] fires fade into the next in the third
[1:59:28] generation embers may be glowing ever so
[1:59:31] slightly in the fourth generation
[1:59:33] there's no vestige whatsoever of the
[1:59:35] original flame
[1:59:37] you know what that tells us god has no
[1:59:39] grandchildren
[1:59:41] he only has sons and daughters of god
[1:59:45] amen every generation must have their
[1:59:47] chance at their revival
[1:59:51] then god will light the fire again and
[1:59:53] the same process is repeated it's simply
[1:59:55] the manifestation of the truth god has
[1:59:57] no grandchildren salvation is not passed
[2:00:00] on by natural birth
[2:00:02] you see this and in the word you start
[2:00:04] out truly being with born-again
[2:00:06] christians or believers in the next
[2:00:08] generation they're no longer just plain
[2:00:10] christians but they take a
[2:00:11] denominational name of baptist or
[2:00:14] methodist
[2:00:15] or perugia or two lord or seven thunders
[2:00:18] or
[2:00:20] return ministry or
[2:00:22] middle of the road or
[2:00:25] whatever you want to brand yourself
[2:00:28] labels
[2:00:30] us for no more
[2:00:34] you see and it gets to a point they take
[2:00:37] on a denominational name
[2:00:40] that fervent desire to please god
[2:00:43] the passion
[2:00:45] to know his word
[2:00:47] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[2:00:49] it begins to fade instead of that church
[2:00:52] being on fire with the fire of god it's
[2:00:54] cooled off and become a bit formal
[2:00:57] this was happening to the ephesians they
[2:00:59] were
[2:01:00] they were getting a bit formal the
[2:01:01] abandonment to god was dying out and the
[2:01:04] people weren't too careful about what
[2:01:06] god thought of them is what to begin to
[2:01:08] get careful about what the world thought
[2:01:10] of them
[2:01:12] the second generation was coming up just
[2:01:14] like israel they demanded a king to be
[2:01:16] like the other nations
[2:01:18] we we gotta we gotta have our own
[2:01:20] personality cult leader
[2:01:24] you see you see a king like the other
[2:01:27] nation but when they did that they
[2:01:29] rejected god
[2:01:31] amen but they did it anyway and that's
[2:01:33] the history of the church when he thinks
[2:01:35] more confirmed conform into the world
[2:01:37] instead of conforming to god it isn't
[2:01:39] long do you see them stop doing the
[2:01:41] things he used to do and start doing
[2:01:43] things they wouldn't do initially they
[2:01:45] changed their manner of dress their
[2:01:47] attitudes and their behavior they get
[2:01:50] locks
[2:01:51] and that's what the ephesus means is
[2:01:54] relaxed and drifting
[2:01:56] that cycle of revival and death has
[2:01:58] never failed
[2:02:01] he said all you have to do is recall
[2:02:03] this last move of god in the spirit with
[2:02:05] men and women dressed like christians
[2:02:08] went to church prayed all night took to
[2:02:10] the street corners
[2:02:12] and weren't ashamed of the
[2:02:14] manifestations of the spirit they left
[2:02:16] their old dead churches
[2:02:19] and they worshipped in homes
[2:02:21] or old store buildings
[2:02:23] they had reality
[2:02:26] but it wasn't too long that they got
[2:02:27] enough money to be able to find new
[2:02:29] churches
[2:02:30] they put in a choir instead of singing
[2:02:32] to god for themselves they put gowns on
[2:02:34] the choir they organized the movement
[2:02:36] ran it by man it wasn't soon they were
[2:02:38] they were reading books it wasn't fit to
[2:02:40] read and they let down the bars and the
[2:02:43] goats came in and took over and the cry
[2:02:45] of joy was gone
[2:02:47] the freedom of the spirit was gone
[2:02:50] all they kept on with the form but the
[2:02:52] fire had died down and the blackness of
[2:02:55] isis
[2:02:56] is all about that is left
[2:03:02] cycle of revival and death
[2:03:05] don't you realize even this movement
[2:03:08] will go down into death
[2:03:13] it has never failed
[2:03:15] and we see it dying
[2:03:18] amen spiritually dying we may have
[2:03:21] bigger buildings we don't have you know
[2:03:23] better dress we may we may be more
[2:03:25] affluent but where's the holy ghost
[2:03:29] [Applause]
[2:03:32] by in lords the church is missing
[2:03:34] something
[2:03:36] amen
[2:03:37] the revival has died down
[2:03:40] and people have let the revival die down
[2:03:42] in their own lives
[2:03:45] are you with me
[2:03:47] amen and many have never been touched by
[2:03:51] the fire of god themselves all they've
[2:03:53] been shown is a picture of it
[2:03:56] and you just can't get warmed by a
[2:03:58] painted fire
[2:04:01] may look pretty it may look real it may
[2:04:04] it may look amazing the artist might
[2:04:06] have done a great work but friends it's
[2:04:08] fake
[2:04:09] [Applause]
[2:04:11] the only way that you can get warm is
[2:04:13] have that original fire
[2:04:16] and every individual
[2:04:18] must receive that fire
[2:04:22] [Applause]
[2:04:26] but i will tell you that i believe that
[2:04:28] in this age that there is a group of
[2:04:31] cycle
[2:04:32] breakers
[2:04:34] amen i read in the bible that he said i
[2:04:37] will have a church
[2:04:38] and she will be without spot or without
[2:04:41] a wrinkle or without a blemish
[2:04:45] hallelujah somebody's going to break the
[2:04:47] cycle
[2:04:48] of revival and death
[2:04:51] are you with me now i read in the church
[2:04:54] in the bible and said there will be a
[2:04:56] church those that are alive and remain
[2:04:59] at the covenant of the lord that will
[2:05:01] not hinder those that are asleep
[2:05:03] i hear i read in the bible there's going
[2:05:06] to be some cycle breakers
[2:05:08] [Applause]
[2:05:11] a people that's not going to leave out
[2:05:13] of here defeated
[2:05:15] a people that will be overcomers
[2:05:17] victorious
[2:05:20] a people who know their god who does
[2:05:22] exploits
[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:35] it's not all bad news
[2:05:39] some will go down into death
[2:05:42] but there's somebody going into life
[2:05:46] there's a rapture promise
[2:05:48] [Applause]
[2:05:50] while the world is falling
[2:05:52] come on
[2:05:53] going down into the pits
[2:05:55] there's a bride ascending
[2:06:00] see not getting weaker she's going to be
[2:06:03] stronger
[2:06:07] brother branham
[2:06:09] preaches a sermon called how can i
[2:06:11] overcome
[2:06:13] this is 1963 after the seals has been
[2:06:16] open
[2:06:17] the land is open to us
[2:06:20] how can i overcome he said i got this
[2:06:22] thought
[2:06:23] because
[2:06:25] i was crossing an old creek or or a
[2:06:28] hollow
[2:06:29] there was an old beach log that was
[2:06:31] laying there
[2:06:32] and he said there
[2:06:34] this one this little log i stepped on it
[2:06:36] and tried to walk across it to cross
[2:06:38] this hollow and he said when i did a big
[2:06:41] old trunk fell off
[2:06:44] and i looked at it
[2:06:46] and he said here to think of it
[2:06:48] it's laying here right in the source of
[2:06:52] life the stream of water
[2:06:55] but without life in it it rottens twice
[2:06:59] as quick
[2:07:02] think about that you can rotten twice as
[2:07:05] quick
[2:07:06] just sitting right there with a stream
[2:07:08] of water is flowing
[2:07:11] because there's no life in you
[2:07:13] [Applause]
[2:07:16] and he said i chose this subject of how
[2:07:18] can i overcome
[2:07:20] because i think it's a time that we
[2:07:22] should never let the spirit of revival
[2:07:24] die
[2:07:30] now we went to america not being able to
[2:07:33] have revival in the divine healing
[2:07:35] movement being over and these revival
[2:07:37] cease to a prophet telling you
[2:07:40] i chose this how can i overcome
[2:07:44] somebody's going to overcome
[2:07:49] stop and think about it
[2:07:51] amen he cannot say to him that
[2:07:53] overcometh
[2:07:55] unless somebody's going to overcome
[2:07:57] [Applause]
[2:07:59] the word is already spoke
[2:08:02] there's going to be overcomers in this
[2:08:04] age who will overcome the lego laodicean
[2:08:07] spirit
[2:08:10] amen and he said i chose us i think it's
[2:08:12] time we should never let the spirit of
[2:08:14] revival die we've got to keep in revival
[2:08:18] constantly
[2:08:19] revived every day
[2:08:24] paul said died daily so christ could
[2:08:26] live
[2:08:28] oh he said these christians are becoming
[2:08:31] so soft and doty dead and sins and
[2:08:34] trespasses so long they can't hold no
[2:08:37] weight at all they don't know what
[2:08:38] overcoming means i begin to think of
[2:08:40] this text overcome keep life in you
[2:08:45] amen when life went out that's what
[2:08:47] brought this log to that condition
[2:08:51] made it worse than what it ever been
[2:08:53] when it laid in the branch where the
[2:08:55] water was you take a christian that's
[2:08:57] supposed to be a christian and let the
[2:08:59] life of god go from him and experience
[2:09:02] and the joy of serving christ
[2:09:05] and that living in a church where such
[2:09:07] is going on he rottens twice as quick
[2:09:11] living right under
[2:09:13] and if we're trying to follow the
[2:09:14] message of the hour we should live
[2:09:16] constantly in the life of christ
[2:09:18] because if you don't you lay around you
[2:09:20] know that that these things that you're
[2:09:22] supposed to do and don't do it the bible
[2:09:24] said he that know what to do good don't
[2:09:26] do it do the naughty to him with sin
[2:09:28] then you're dody you're rotten and
[2:09:29] you're separated from the life of god's
[2:09:31] strife with all that is in you to stay
[2:09:34] in the life of christ
[2:09:37] and you be fruit bearing
[2:09:41] are you with me now
[2:09:43] so we see now how this laodicean age
[2:09:47] it it see how it closes out
[2:09:50] and see the church failing to overcome
[2:09:53] becoming lukewarm
[2:09:56] and powerless and jesus refused entrance
[2:10:00] into his own church
[2:10:04] and i'll tell you there's too many
[2:10:05] places
[2:10:07] that the spirit is not welcome
[2:10:10] and is not wanted
[2:10:14] amen
[2:10:16] listen brother adam said of the bride
[2:10:18] she will not be laid to see us by no
[2:10:20] means a lukewarm she'll be on fire for
[2:10:23] god
[2:10:24] she'll be moving in the spirit of god
[2:10:28] he speaks of this in revelation 3 to the
[2:10:31] laodiceans and he said how god describes
[2:10:34] this last age and he says you know that
[2:10:37] certainly fits the situation of the day
[2:10:39] of the modern church
[2:10:41] today a lukewarm condition neither cold
[2:10:44] nor hot it would be better if we would
[2:10:46] be back in our old denominational state
[2:10:49] or status or either be up in the realms
[2:10:51] of the blessing of god than to sit in a
[2:10:53] lukewarm condition as we are now god
[2:10:56] would appreciate us much more
[2:10:59] if we would do that
[2:11:04] so you see
[2:11:05] you see when when we allow the fire to
[2:11:08] get down in our own lives
[2:11:11] when we're not constantly pouring on the
[2:11:14] wood of the word
[2:11:16] we're not building it up in prayer and
[2:11:19] and relationship with god
[2:11:22] now then you see that's a revival killer
[2:11:24] now here's another revival killer
[2:11:27] you know a revival killer another reason
[2:11:29] for no revivals well we we have preached
[2:11:33] and it's so true
[2:11:35] we are predestinated
[2:11:37] and we are secure
[2:11:39] but if we're not careful we take an
[2:11:41] attitude the rest of them can go to hell
[2:11:43] if
[2:11:45] [Applause]
[2:11:47] that we get unconcerned about the lost
[2:11:52] you know it all becomes about us for and
[2:11:55] no more
[2:11:57] and we close our hearts and our doors to
[2:11:59] everybody else
[2:12:04] in the fifth seal brother branham said
[2:12:05] john wesley come along after zingli had
[2:12:07] come in and then with calvin and he
[2:12:10] calvin got to church to play some
[2:12:12] security they didn't want more revivals
[2:12:15] whatever it's going to be is going to be
[2:12:17] that's all they just lived any kind of
[2:12:19] lives
[2:12:22] and this can be we get we get we don't
[2:12:24] want revival because we're just happy
[2:12:26] with the status quo
[2:12:28] we're just happy with a denominational
[2:12:30] life
[2:12:32] in a message church and we got the truth
[2:12:34] and we go to church and we do our little
[2:12:37] thing and we're we're saved and we're
[2:12:39] predestinated and blessed god our my
[2:12:41] name was on the book of life before the
[2:12:43] foundation of the world and we get to
[2:12:46] the point we don't want a revival
[2:12:49] because we're so secure
[2:12:54] we're so sure we're going to make the
[2:12:56] rapture
[2:12:58] that there is no call of god for more of
[2:13:01] god
[2:13:02] there's no more hunger to know his word
[2:13:04] there's no more passion for truth
[2:13:07] there you know
[2:13:08] again our study comes around to prove a
[2:13:11] point
[2:13:13] rather than the seal of the hour to
[2:13:15] repent
[2:13:18] that's the whole thing that we ought to
[2:13:20] do is we ought to look at the message
[2:13:22] and say lord oh god let me find where i
[2:13:25] need to straighten up a little bit
[2:13:27] i need to come a little closer to you
[2:13:30] amen change me
[2:13:32] forget about changing everybody else i
[2:13:34] need to be changed god
[2:13:36] i need a revival in myself
[2:13:39] i need the holy spirit to live in my
[2:13:42] life
[2:13:43] meant to manifest yourself through me
[2:13:45] well that old man dream dreams and young
[2:13:48] men see vision and god you poured out
[2:13:50] your spirit upon men and women and in
[2:13:53] the church
[2:13:54] [Applause]
[2:13:55] [Music]
[2:13:59] here's another revival killer
[2:14:02] in every age we've had the same pattern
[2:14:04] brother branham said this is why the
[2:14:06] light comes a god-given messenger in a
[2:14:09] certain area and then from that
[2:14:10] messenger there spreads a light through
[2:14:12] the ministry of others who have been
[2:14:14] faithfully taught
[2:14:16] but of course all those who don't go who
[2:14:18] go out don't always learn how necessary
[2:14:21] it is to speak only what the messenger
[2:14:24] has spoken
[2:14:25] remember paul warned the people to say
[2:14:28] only what he said
[2:14:29] first corinthians 14 37 if any man
[2:14:32] thinks himself a be a prophet or
[2:14:33] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[2:14:35] things that i write into you are the
[2:14:37] commandments of the lord what came the
[2:14:40] word of god out from you or cave it unto
[2:14:43] you only they add here and they take
[2:14:45] away there and soon the message is no
[2:14:47] longer pure and the revival dies down
[2:14:51] how careful we must be to hear one voice
[2:14:55] for the spirit has but one voice which
[2:14:58] is the voice of god
[2:15:00] and paul warned him to say what he said
[2:15:02] peter did likewise he warned them that
[2:15:04] even he paul could not change one word
[2:15:06] of what he had been given by revelation
[2:15:09] how important it is to hear the voice of
[2:15:11] god by the way of his messenger and then
[2:15:14] say what has been given them to say to
[2:15:17] the churches
[2:15:19] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:15:21] the spirit said to the church
[2:15:23] in every age it was the same cry hear
[2:15:25] what the spirit says if you're a
[2:15:27] christian you will get back to what the
[2:15:29] spirit is teaching that is the word of
[2:15:32] this age
[2:15:33] every messenger to the to every age will
[2:15:36] preach that word
[2:15:38] every fresh and true revival will be
[2:15:42] because man has gotten back to the word
[2:15:45] for their age
[2:15:47] the cry of every age is a rebuke you've
[2:15:49] left the word of god repent come back to
[2:15:52] the word from the first book of the
[2:15:53] bible genesis the last book of
[2:15:55] revelation there's only one reason for
[2:15:58] god's displeasure leaving the word and
[2:16:00] there's only one remedy to regain his
[2:16:02] favor back to the word
[2:16:05] in ephesian age this age and every age
[2:16:07] we contemplate we will see that it's
[2:16:10] true
[2:16:10] and the last stages our age will find a
[2:16:13] blackout of the word the complete
[2:16:14] apostasy ended in the great tribulation
[2:16:17] if you're truly seed if you're baptized
[2:16:20] with the holy ghost you will esteem his
[2:16:23] word above your necessary meat and yearn
[2:16:26] to live by every word that proceedeth
[2:16:29] out of the mouth of god
[2:16:34] but what have we done in the last
[2:16:36] 50 years
[2:16:38] we've had a time of great training
[2:16:42] great teachings
[2:16:44] you know and and great training of
[2:16:46] ministers and things that
[2:16:48] and i'm quoting brother branham that's
[2:16:50] taking the place of all night prayer
[2:16:52] meetings
[2:16:53] the only time way that you used to get
[2:16:55] to god instead of having preachers we
[2:16:57] got lectures
[2:17:01] man who knows the word just as well they
[2:17:03] can sit there and put it together in
[2:17:04] such a way it's astounding how they can
[2:17:06] do it they know the mechanics
[2:17:09] but that ain't the dynamics
[2:17:11] we don't we want the dynamics he said i
[2:17:14] don't care about the mechanics i want to
[2:17:16] know the dynamics what does it do
[2:17:20] hey man i don't know how that car runs
[2:17:23] out there it's got piston cylinder i
[2:17:24] don't know how much pressure is used the
[2:17:26] only thing i know is the dynamics put
[2:17:28] her out there and drive it and that's
[2:17:30] what we know god made the promise i'll
[2:17:32] pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[2:17:35] your sons and your daughters shall
[2:17:36] prophesy how's he going to do it i can't
[2:17:39] tell you i just know the dynamics of
[2:17:42] god's system
[2:17:45] i tell you what when brother random left
[2:17:47] us he left us a car that ran
[2:17:53] are you with me it would drive down the
[2:17:56] road to divine healing
[2:17:59] oh yeah it would drive down to the real
[2:18:02] power of god
[2:18:03] it would drive down to god godly men and
[2:18:07] godly women and prayer lodge come on
[2:18:09] church
[2:18:10] it was a car that would go somewhere
[2:18:13] i mean it just didn't sit as a model
[2:18:16] sitting in a garage somewhere that would
[2:18:18] polish the hubs and we talk about it's
[2:18:21] fine it's fine paint job and it's fine
[2:18:24] uh arts and it's fine steering wheel and
[2:18:27] the dough skin seats and oh it's fine
[2:18:30] it's fine and you know we got the right
[2:18:33] kind of hubcaps oh it's a beautiful car
[2:18:36] oh it's a lovely message no the message
[2:18:39] worked
[2:18:40] it would heal the sick it would cast out
[2:18:43] devils it would give overcoming lives it
[2:18:46] would give the power of god
[2:18:48] [Applause]
[2:18:51] but you know the problem is we've had
[2:18:53] too many quack mechanics
[2:18:55] that's wanted to try to
[2:18:57] tinker with the car
[2:19:05] until in too many churches the motor
[2:19:07] won't even turn over anymore
[2:19:12] and it ain't drove out of the garage in
[2:19:14] years
[2:19:17] it won't take young people down to
[2:19:19] a real christ-like experience of the
[2:19:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:19:24] and it don't produce divine healing
[2:19:27] and deliverance
[2:19:30] that's a sad state
[2:19:32] to take the message that god sent us
[2:19:36] until it gets just something that is a
[2:19:39] well-oiled machine you know signed up
[2:19:41] but it won't go nowhere
[2:19:46] brother brandon said i was at a in a
[2:19:48] railroad yard and that was one of these
[2:19:50] new engines that was on display and it
[2:19:52] just had everything just so beautiful
[2:19:54] and shined and everything else and it
[2:19:56] was a prettiest thing and he said it was
[2:19:58] about like these churches you know that
[2:20:00] everything's in place and you know we
[2:20:02] got all the order and everything and
[2:20:05] every ah man was the prettiest and
[2:20:07] hollywood evangelism and all of this
[2:20:10] kind of stuff and and he says
[2:20:13] i looked at it and he walked through it
[2:20:15] and he said when's this thing going to
[2:20:16] move
[2:20:17] i'd like to take a little ride can it
[2:20:19] move he said no
[2:20:21] so why can't it move said there's no
[2:20:23] fire in the engine
[2:20:25] and he said that's what's the matter
[2:20:27] with the church today
[2:20:28] it's plushed up it's decorated up with
[2:20:31] no fire in the engine you can only move
[2:20:34] by fire
[2:20:36] what we need he said is some more holy
[2:20:38] ghost and fire
[2:20:39] [Applause]
[2:20:41] and that's what true that is what has
[2:20:43] happened too often we've accepted the
[2:20:46] tradition of easy believism the message
[2:20:49] of billy graham instead of the message
[2:20:51] to abraham that and that will send you
[2:20:54] right down into the tribulation period
[2:20:59] let me tell you something friends
[2:21:02] the pentecostal blessing ought to flow
[2:21:04] to the church
[2:21:06] we got a lot of intellectual preachers
[2:21:09] and teachers and where did they take us
[2:21:12] where did they take us we've got 60
[2:21:14] years of kingdom building
[2:21:17] made personality cults
[2:21:21] you know
[2:21:22] i'm a paul and i'm a of apollos and i'm
[2:21:26] a christ and we you know all of these
[2:21:29] different things
[2:21:30] we build our little personality culture
[2:21:33] and paul said aren't you carnal and walk
[2:21:35] his men
[2:21:38] sure it's natural to like this preacher
[2:21:40] or that preacher what but that ain't
[2:21:41] spiritual
[2:21:45] amen and when we turn around and they
[2:21:48] make kingdom building and personality
[2:21:50] cults
[2:21:52] i tell you it's time we smash those
[2:21:53] idols
[2:21:54] [Applause]
[2:21:57] amen look at the folly of powerless
[2:22:00] group of people whose only weapon is
[2:22:02] argument
[2:22:06] you see there is no revival possible
[2:22:08] until jesus is welcomed back
[2:22:11] into the midst
[2:22:14] and the ministry and the people quit
[2:22:16] putting him out of their churches like a
[2:22:17] bunch of
[2:22:20] laodiceans then you have the other side
[2:22:23] you know all screaming hollering calling
[2:22:24] at the bride's revival when it's nothing
[2:22:26] but a bunch of man-made emotional workup
[2:22:31] you see that's where satan gets in to
[2:22:33] make it all mechanics or no dynamics i
[2:22:36] put uh put all dynamics and no mechanics
[2:22:40] is that right we got to bring it
[2:22:41] together
[2:22:45] one of it won't work
[2:22:47] hey man it's like you know i'm a farm
[2:22:49] boy so you know if i we had a bunch of
[2:22:51] chickens and some began to escape the
[2:22:53] the chicken panda that we had
[2:22:56] what we did is we just clipped one wing
[2:22:59] that's all you had to do
[2:23:01] if you clipped them both they could
[2:23:02] still fly over the fence
[2:23:04] but if you clip just one wing he'd just
[2:23:06] flop around in a circle
[2:23:08] he couldn't get off the ground
[2:23:11] amen god gives us two wings spirit and
[2:23:13] truth
[2:23:14] mechanics dynamics
[2:23:17] are you with me amen if you don't have
[2:23:20] any mechanics if the word ain't right
[2:23:24] you ain't gonna get off the ground
[2:23:26] amen if the spirit ain't right you're
[2:23:28] not getting off the ground
[2:23:30] you just flop around and around around
[2:23:32] and stay in your pen but if you can have
[2:23:35] both wings
[2:23:38] spirit and truth
[2:23:40] hallelujah dynamics and mechanics
[2:23:43] that's what it's going to be then you
[2:23:45] can man up with wings as an eagle and
[2:23:48] you can fly into the realms where all
[2:23:51] things are possible to them that believe
[2:23:53] [Applause]
[2:23:57] you see
[2:23:58] it's the word
[2:24:00] it's the word not creeds of two lords or
[2:24:04] some personality
[2:24:05] cult or not uh not a thunder of a bunch
[2:24:08] of noise with no lightning but the power
[2:24:10] of god on display
[2:24:12] we've had years of teachers now that
[2:24:15] claimed to be the aaron to the moses
[2:24:18] who needed to help brother branham say
[2:24:20] what he could not well they did
[2:24:22] they helped him say what he didn't
[2:24:25] amen they even helped him today say what
[2:24:27] he didn't and say well there's no
[2:24:28] preachers no more god didn't call him to
[2:24:30] preach
[2:24:32] you see they got to help him to say what
[2:24:34] he didn't say what he couldn't say
[2:24:37] you see again we've had to self-proclaim
[2:24:40] apostles who thought it was thought
[2:24:43] they were needed to bring clarity to the
[2:24:45] message
[2:24:47] again that this thought was needed to
[2:24:49] help brother branham say what he
[2:24:50] couldn't say
[2:24:53] so we need this personality cult leader
[2:24:57] to say what he couldn't say
[2:24:59] to do what he couldn't do
[2:25:02] and so again it's a revival killer
[2:25:06] that we have
[2:25:07] that we have want to be prophets that
[2:25:09] risen and they've invaded the pulpit
[2:25:11] without a true call from god style
[2:25:14] themselves as officials of men and say
[2:25:16] the gifted ministry of ephesians 4 is
[2:25:19] that god gave the church has failed so
[2:25:22] they're taking over men in the pulpit
[2:25:25] have never been called of god
[2:25:28] never been anointed to preach
[2:25:31] amen intellectual men that just get up
[2:25:33] you know and they got their speech to
[2:25:35] give and oh they can lay it out so
[2:25:37] beautiful in water it takes the
[2:25:39] anointing
[2:25:40] to break the yoke
[2:25:43] that's what we need in the pulpit is
[2:25:45] anointed preachers
[2:25:47] men on fire
[2:25:48] lit by the fire of god
[2:25:51] men who know their god who know their
[2:25:54] ministry is called to cast out devils
[2:25:57] that ought to be one of the number one
[2:25:59] thing in the church we are called to
[2:26:02] cast satan out
[2:26:04] cast him out of our young people cast
[2:26:06] him out of their marriages cast him out
[2:26:09] of our homes
[2:26:10] cast him out of our churches
[2:26:12] [Applause]
[2:26:19] they add here
[2:26:20] they take away there
[2:26:22] soon the message is no longer pure
[2:26:25] revival
[2:26:27] dies down
[2:26:29] oh we got to hear that voice of the
[2:26:31] spirit
[2:26:32] one voice
[2:26:35] amount
[2:26:36] he warned even paul don't you you can't
[2:26:38] change one word
[2:26:40] amen no you can't he said if i or an
[2:26:43] angel from heaven preach you any other
[2:26:45] gospel
[2:26:46] let him be accursed
[2:26:48] there's no hope for revival
[2:26:50] you see because
[2:26:53] you see because
[2:26:54] because of men
[2:26:56] they're adding to taken away from the
[2:26:58] word of god i'm not through with this
[2:27:00] yet but i just want to say
[2:27:02] i want to say to this there is hope for
[2:27:04] revival
[2:27:06] because god is hearing the cries
[2:27:09] the sign
[2:27:11] because of the bondage
[2:27:14] some of you that have been bound by
[2:27:16] pornography
[2:27:18] by demons of oppression
[2:27:21] with young people with suicide
[2:27:24] amen we will come on church and with
[2:27:27] spirits of insanity that are coming in
[2:27:31] amen with the spirits of adultery and
[2:27:33] fornication and every kind of evil
[2:27:36] spirit that wants to come and take a
[2:27:37] place in the church
[2:27:40] are you with me god is hearing the cry
[2:27:43] of what the devil is trying to do in
[2:27:46] message churches
[2:27:48] because there are men and women saying
[2:27:49] oh god
[2:27:50] we need a move of god we need the holy
[2:27:53] ghost we need a revival in our mess we
[2:27:56] need something real for our young people
[2:27:59] that they whip their way to calvary and
[2:28:01] our own people get a renewing of the
[2:28:03] holy ghost again and then it causes
[2:28:06] their feet to dance and their voice to
[2:28:08] be lifted up to shout amen in the holy
[2:28:11] spirit moving in the church one more
[2:28:14] time
[2:28:15] [Applause]
[2:28:20] god hears the sign of the cry but he's
[2:28:23] only waiting for people to call him into
[2:28:25] action
[2:28:26] amen i'm waiting by waiting for people
[2:28:29] to call on him
[2:28:31] when we hear a god that is still god
[2:28:34] like we heard last night
[2:28:35] a god that still heals
[2:28:38] a god that forgives
[2:28:40] a god that saves a god that delivers
[2:28:44] amen all that ought to know in our faith
[2:28:48] it ought to cause revival to rise on the
[2:28:50] inside and expectancy i'm expecting in
[2:28:54] god to move
[2:28:56] if he can do it for them he can do it
[2:28:58] for me if he healed cancer then he can
[2:29:01] heal he can heal it now
[2:29:04] hallelujah are you with me
[2:29:06] amen if we can reach out and bring a
[2:29:08] prodigal back home then they can bring
[2:29:11] it back now
[2:29:12] [Applause]
[2:29:16] wasn't too long ago we had a young
[2:29:18] girl come up in the prayer line and she
[2:29:21] was crying out to god for her brother
[2:29:23] said i want my brother who is lost he's
[2:29:26] living with a whirly girl living away
[2:29:28] from god and he just broke up our family
[2:29:32] and and we're j you know he said they're
[2:29:34] just tension in the home and all kinds
[2:29:36] of things come away my brother i wasn't
[2:29:38] saved
[2:29:40] so we prayed with her and there as we
[2:29:43] were praying with others in the prayer
[2:29:44] line before the prayer line was over
[2:29:46] that boy was laying in bed at home in
[2:29:50] his pajamas
[2:29:52] jumped out of his bed
[2:29:55] got in his car
[2:29:57] drove all the way to the church
[2:30:00] came into the house of god before that
[2:30:03] service is over god answered the prayer
[2:30:06] of a 16 year old girl who called on god
[2:30:09] for her brother
[2:30:11] that same god will answer your prayer
[2:30:14] you've been calling out for your
[2:30:16] children your brother your mother your
[2:30:18] sister
[2:30:19] that god will answer your prayer today
[2:30:21] he'll reach out he can reach down to the
[2:30:24] gutter boats and bring them out of sin
[2:30:27] and world and ungodliness
[2:30:30] he's a god he's a god that delivers
[2:30:34] a god that saves
[2:30:36] i'll tell you what we ought to do in
[2:30:38] meetings like this to get ready for a
[2:30:44] party hallelujah get ready for a party
[2:30:48] that's what we ought to do
[2:30:50] we ought to get ready for a celebration
[2:30:53] men women boys and girls that have been
[2:30:56] lost and out in sin they're coming back
[2:30:58] home we ought to get our dancing shoes
[2:31:01] on we got to have ourselves that our god
[2:31:05] is in our mess and he's doing something
[2:31:10] should anoint our faith
[2:31:13] hallelujah
[2:31:15] hallelujah
[2:31:17] [Applause]
[2:31:22] well brother tim we're in revival but
[2:31:26] our revival is the opening of the word
[2:31:28] brother tim
[2:31:31] well in wyolith a little bethlehem
[2:31:33] brother branham said
[2:31:34] we bypassed on creeds and drinking
[2:31:36] stagnated water from cisterns
[2:31:39] what we need today is an opening of the
[2:31:43] word that lives
[2:31:45] and he's the same yesterday today and
[2:31:48] forever
[2:31:49] amen i'll tell you i'm all far at the
[2:31:52] opening of the word
[2:31:54] but we need one that lives
[2:31:56] that brings back jesus christ the same
[2:31:59] yesterday today and forever that gives
[2:32:02] our people hope
[2:32:05] [Applause]
[2:32:08] brother branham said life must not come
[2:32:11] out of just an intellectual revival it's
[2:32:13] got to come out of the bible a word
[2:32:15] revival
[2:32:17] and the word is the same yesterday today
[2:32:20] and forever and when it falls today and
[2:32:22] quickens you get the same results you
[2:32:24] did in acts 2.
[2:32:27] that's an opening of the word that lives
[2:32:30] you get the same results
[2:32:32] as x2
[2:32:33] [Applause]
[2:32:36] i'll tell you what we need to get our
[2:32:37] focus back
[2:32:39] we need to get our focus back on a
[2:32:41] living god
[2:32:43] amen bring it down to a place there
[2:32:46] where we can see the same things the
[2:32:48] apostles saw
[2:32:50] the same gospel they preached
[2:32:52] produce the same results that it
[2:32:54] produced for them that'll strike the
[2:32:56] target every time
[2:32:59] hallelujah a word that lives a word that
[2:33:02] is in focus and that word when it's in
[2:33:05] focus it'll do the same job for you it
[2:33:07] did for them either heal the sick it'll
[2:33:10] raise the dead it'll cast out devils
[2:33:12] it'll bring forth the glorious church
[2:33:16] hallelujah
[2:33:25] god hiding himself in simplicity
[2:33:28] he got to find something that will take
[2:33:30] his word
[2:33:32] we'll take the divine revelation and
[2:33:33] won't move with it
[2:33:35] we'll stay right there on the word
[2:33:37] that's the way he does it
[2:33:39] he's always done it that way so when men
[2:33:41] get so educated and so smart that he
[2:33:44] tries to put his own interpretation say
[2:33:46] well
[2:33:48] like they say baptism of the holy ghost
[2:33:50] they say oh that was for another day but
[2:33:53] if they don't well it wasn't for another
[2:33:55] day but i tell you it just don't come
[2:33:57] like it did on the day of pentecost
[2:34:00] we received the holy ghost when we
[2:34:01] believe and all kinds of stuff like that
[2:34:04] you see and then then others will go to
[2:34:06] seed on other quotes
[2:34:08] like you know this is not the day of
[2:34:10] pentecost for the repeat or return
[2:34:13] and i want to say that's true
[2:34:15] i don't deny that one bit this is not
[2:34:17] the day of pentecost
[2:34:19] instead it's the last stage
[2:34:22] this is not the repeat of pentecost
[2:34:25] pentecost was a seed that was planted
[2:34:29] and went down into the ground
[2:34:32] come on church this is the seed of the
[2:34:35] harvest
[2:34:36] and it's going to be taken into the
[2:34:38] garner
[2:34:39] [Applause]
[2:34:43] hallelujah
[2:34:44] so now it's not a repeat of pentecost
[2:34:46] we're not just starting all over again
[2:34:48] starting seven ages
[2:34:50] amen this is rapture rage
[2:34:53] it's a rapture day
[2:34:56] amen this is not not just a return to
[2:34:58] pentecost amen it's more than that
[2:35:02] [Applause]
[2:35:04] amen oh it's time to get out of the
[2:35:06] glares that have been and then the and
[2:35:08] in the midst of the darkness this dark
[2:35:10] time they're not the real light
[2:35:13] they're not the messenger choirs they're
[2:35:15] mirageous
[2:35:17] but oh i tell you friends
[2:35:20] you see
[2:35:21] that's where they live today
[2:35:23] in mirages of the times past
[2:35:26] the catholic church is living on his
[2:35:28] past reputation
[2:35:30] we were the first church look how far
[2:35:32] they moved from it
[2:35:34] look with their apology today of the
[2:35:36] sodomy and their in their pulpits
[2:35:39] in their priesthood
[2:35:41] look at their apologies of how we
[2:35:43] treated what we did how we enslaved what
[2:35:45] we did you see and and brother branham
[2:35:48] said to priests if you're all like the
[2:35:50] original church and you went after the
[2:35:53] doctrine of these men set up at nicaea
[2:35:56] why is it you haven't got the power they
[2:35:59] had back there at the beginning
[2:36:01] why don't you do the things that they
[2:36:03] did which jesus said
[2:36:05] or we've got more people now we live in
[2:36:07] a different age he said but the word
[2:36:09] doesn't change these signs shall follow
[2:36:11] them that believe heavens and earth will
[2:36:13] pass away but my word will never
[2:36:17] he said in the church when they obeyed
[2:36:19] what god said originally and the word of
[2:36:21] god look at the miracles and signs and
[2:36:23] so forth they had and you don't have
[2:36:26] them at all today it's the evidence god
[2:36:28] is not with you
[2:36:31] if he said that to the roman church he
[2:36:33] says that same thing to those today
[2:36:36] amen oh you know well but you know
[2:36:38] brother tim we we've seen our last sign
[2:36:41] and and and so you know there's just
[2:36:43] nothing more let me tell you you are
[2:36:45] god's last sign

[2:37:28] investment
[2:37:29] the last thing
[2:37:31] that the church is going to see
[2:37:34] is christ manifested in his power in
[2:37:36] fullness in his church

[2:40:01] amen but he said that satan's big
[2:40:04] machine up there ready to move to christ
[2:40:06] down but remember god's little flock
[2:40:09] that believes the word its mechanics is
[2:40:12] ready too
[2:40:13] it's ready for the dynamics
[2:40:16] to set it a fire with the holy ghost
[2:40:18] fear not little flock it's your father's
[2:40:20] good will to give you the kingdom the
[2:40:23] holy ghost will strike a little church
[2:40:26] that has come out from the world women
[2:40:29] that wears long hair nazarite to prove
[2:40:31] they've separated themselves from the
[2:40:33] world
[2:40:35] hallelujah amen the holy ghost will
[2:40:38] strike a church
[2:40:41] that's come out of the world
[2:40:43] little women that wears long hair
[2:40:45] nazarite
[2:40:47] amen as i quoted earlier you know he
[2:40:49] said there's still room
[2:40:51] at the table
[2:40:53] amen there's still there's still got to
[2:40:55] be one more somewhere
[2:40:58] we went home yet somebody helped me
[2:41:00] preach
[2:41:01] god's gonna send another shaking across
[2:41:04] the country where there's somebody still
[2:41:06] out there somewhere for that
[2:41:07] predestinated seed that the lights have
[2:41:10] fallen somewhere in the world
[2:41:13] amen now is there hope for revival
[2:41:16] in the message of token i'm looking for
[2:41:18] a time a break forth of the spirit of
[2:41:21] god in the last days when we're living
[2:41:24] for another surge of the holy spirit
[2:41:27] into the church for a rapture and faith
[2:41:29] just before it comes and everything is
[2:41:32] setting right straight in order for that
[2:41:34] and i believe we're now at the time that
[2:41:36] the word house should have preeminence
[2:41:39] what he say here another surge of the
[2:41:42] holy spirit
[2:41:44] amen he preaches perfect faith and he
[2:41:46] said i i'm trying to get the church into
[2:41:49] place where we can really see apostolic
[2:41:52] times moving among us that's what we all
[2:41:55] hunger and it's laying right at the door
[2:41:58] we see it
[2:42:01] but we want more of it
[2:42:03] we wanted such a flow that it'll help to
[2:42:05] us and flow out to others
[2:42:10] hallelujah amen he tells us in three
[2:42:13] kinds of believer that's the reason i do
[2:42:16] believe when that bride is called out
[2:42:18] and elected and said in the book of life
[2:42:21] there will come a sound from heaven that
[2:42:23] it takes such a baptism of the holy
[2:42:25] spirit and that bride that'll take her
[2:42:28] from the earth in a raptured grace
[2:42:32] hallelujah amen a sound from heaven that
[2:42:35] takes such a baptism of the holy ghost
[2:42:38] into that bride take her from the earth
[2:42:40] and the glory
[2:42:41] amen what do you say the dynamics of
[2:42:43] this church will be a refilling of the
[2:42:46] holy ghost that we worked in a small
[2:42:48] measure but the full power of the holy
[2:42:50] ghost would raise her up and bring all
[2:42:53] the dead in christ
[2:42:54] from thousands of years
[2:42:59] hallelujah
[2:43:01] amen he'd stand an invisible union of
[2:43:04] the bride and he would prophesy and he
[2:43:06] said it's on the move is on for the
[2:43:09] bride that's thus saith the lord
[2:43:15] hallelujah
[2:43:17] revival's over for the church revival's
[2:43:19] over for america come on somebody the
[2:43:22] divine healing movement is over azusa
[2:43:24] street my healing is over but the move
[2:43:27] is on for the bride
[2:43:29] that's thus saith the lord
[2:43:35] hallelujah just saith the lord never
[2:43:37] fails
[2:43:38] [Applause]
[2:43:48] one of the things that brother branham
[2:43:50] in the end of his ministry labored on
[2:43:53] he actually would do this
[2:43:55] starting with his own church
[2:43:59] he had he had a thought that he waved
[2:44:01] back and forth in fact there were
[2:44:02] several of them maybe
[2:44:05] sunday morning i'll get into some of the
[2:44:06] others
[2:44:08] but there's two thoughts brother branham
[2:44:09] will interwove back and forth
[2:44:12] one was
[2:44:13] was
[2:44:14] one thought was contained and be not
[2:44:16] afraid
[2:44:17] testimony on the sea
[2:44:19] go away jesus and others that dealt
[2:44:22] with where the disciples were between
[2:44:24] revivals and the testifying of the past
[2:44:28] and yet had gone without jesus
[2:44:31] and the other thought of course was the
[2:44:33] one of samson
[2:44:35] crying
[2:44:36] once more lord
[2:44:41] and brother branham preached the sermon
[2:44:43] on samson as the present state of the
[2:44:45] church
[2:44:46] as a deceived church by the world
[2:44:49] and warned his own church
[2:44:53] of being blinded and defeated and scared
[2:44:56] of the new birth
[2:45:01] the thought of samson was not just
[2:45:03] something he preached to the
[2:45:04] pentecostals
[2:45:07] he knew he could not revive azusa street
[2:45:11] but he preached it first at brenham
[2:45:13] tabernacle
[2:45:16] and he took samson
[2:45:18] and showed him as a deceived church by
[2:45:21] the world
[2:45:23] and and there as he explained it and he
[2:45:26] said
[2:45:27] you know the the people the reason they
[2:45:30] go and join organizations and substitute
[2:45:32] a handshake instead of new birth they're
[2:45:34] trying to bypass the new birth
[2:45:38] they don't want the new birth we know
[2:45:40] it's taught in the bible so we want to
[2:45:42] substitute something and the pentecostal
[2:45:44] people are just so bad trying to
[2:45:45] substitute something they want it in
[2:45:47] class
[2:45:48] it's got so classy
[2:45:50] we'll just shake hands and join the
[2:45:52] church and be sprinkled and baptized and
[2:45:54] they're afraid of the new birth and he
[2:45:56] says i'm sometimes believed that branham
[2:45:58] tabernacle's getting afraid of it
[2:46:01] so this wasn't something he was just
[2:46:03] concerned about them out there he was
[2:46:05] concerned about his own church
[2:46:08] getting afraid of the new birth
[2:46:11] and he talked about a birth and he said
[2:46:13] a birth is a mess no matter where it's
[2:46:15] at
[2:46:17] if it's in a pink decorated hospital
[2:46:19] room or whether it's there in a shuck
[2:46:22] pile it's a mess
[2:46:25] hey man he said a new birth is nothing
[2:46:27] more than a mess
[2:46:29] but people get so starchy
[2:46:31] we'll go over where they just shake
[2:46:33] hands
[2:46:34] i mean you believe god sent a prophet
[2:46:36] god bless you then you've got the holy
[2:46:38] ghost
[2:46:39] you believe in serpent seed and
[2:46:41] predestination and malachi 4 and you've
[2:46:43] got the holy ghost
[2:46:45] you see they don't want a mess
[2:46:48] we want it's so classy you know just
[2:46:50] believe this doctrine we have the truth
[2:46:54] not just so you know do you believe that
[2:46:56] yes well then you've got it
[2:46:58] and can't live overcoming lives
[2:47:02] still in every kind of sin and
[2:47:04] ungodliness
[2:47:07] listen let me let me tell you something
[2:47:09] you i i'm i'm i i meet with you and
[2:47:12] especially in the youth camps i meet
[2:47:14] with devils
[2:47:15] demons
[2:47:17] that have actually taken on the young
[2:47:19] people
[2:47:21] i had a girl coming to a print to the
[2:47:23] prayer line here some years ago now and
[2:47:26] then and there's a moment i anointed
[2:47:28] with all its chains and crouched down

[2:48:01] it had to bow to the name of jesus
[2:48:03] christ
[2:48:04] these sons have followed them that
[2:48:06] believe in my name they will cast out
[2:48:08] devils
[2:48:10] i asked a girl later i said where did
[2:48:12] that devil come into you at she said it
[2:48:15] wasn't things i actually did it was
[2:48:17] things that i looked at and it was my
[2:48:19] imagination you see it was pornography
[2:48:21] and it come in through the eye gate and
[2:48:24] entered right down into her until she
[2:48:26] was so demon possessed when she was
[2:48:29] anointed with oil
[2:48:32] he come out
[2:48:33] and it used her voice
[2:48:36] because it was used in her mind
[2:48:38] and spirits are entered into people
[2:48:42] demon possessed
[2:48:44] [Music]
[2:48:48] i have to say
[2:48:50] she would hit at me right there it would
[2:48:51] just
[2:48:52] it i'd feel like wind blood and blow my
[2:48:54] clothes but she can never make a
[2:48:56] connection
[2:48:58] a full wall of fire about me i have
[2:49:02] nothing now to fear
[2:49:06] hallelujah all hail the power of jesus
[2:49:09] name
[2:49:10] even demons and the angels had to
[2:49:13] prostrate fall
[2:49:15] amen he's lord of lords and king of
[2:49:17] kings
[2:49:19] amen and i've seen it happen time and
[2:49:22] time and time again
[2:49:24] in one of our youth camps we had over to
[2:49:27] over what was a ten or a dozen and about
[2:49:30] ten did not demonic manifestations that
[2:49:34] manifest itself just that way
[2:49:37] writhing on the floor speaking out and
[2:49:40] calling out i won't come out and all
[2:49:42] kinds of things that was happening
[2:49:46] what is happening
[2:49:48] demons are taking over people
[2:49:51] evil spirits getting a hold of them but
[2:49:54] i'll tell you what the doctors don't
[2:49:56] have a cure for it
[2:49:58] they can just dupe you down
[2:50:00] but i tell you something we got
[2:50:02] something better than dope
[2:50:05] it'll give you a new mind it'll give you
[2:50:08] a new heart it'll give you a new spirit
[2:50:10] it'll put god's holy spirit on the
[2:50:12] inside of you
[2:50:15] hallelujah
[2:50:17] but we don't want a birth
[2:50:20] that's a mess
[2:50:21] but he said the new birth is nothing
[2:50:23] less than a mess and people get so
[2:50:26] starchy we'll go to a place where they
[2:50:28] shake hands we'll go over where they
[2:50:30] don't bawl and cry and beat on an altar
[2:50:33] and cry out he said you want to be too
[2:50:36] human
[2:50:37] what we need is a birth to dine out
[2:50:42] amen that's exactly what you need if you
[2:50:44] want to be born again you got to die
[2:50:46] first
[2:50:49] amen the holy spirit is not going to
[2:50:51] live in there with that demon
[2:50:54] that you cannot serve two masters there
[2:50:57] has to be a dying out and rejecting of
[2:51:00] that king that was upon the throne of
[2:51:02] your heart that you were born with
[2:51:04] because of your natural birth but when
[2:51:06] you get born again that king is
[2:51:08] dethroned and cast out and you get a new
[2:51:11] king on the inside of you
[2:51:13] [Applause]
[2:51:16] and then those members that used to
[2:51:19] serve the former king to smoke and drank
[2:51:22] and committed adultery and looked at the
[2:51:24] wrong thing now those members are
[2:51:26] yielded to the holy ghost and you raise
[2:51:28] up holy hands unto god and you shout and
[2:51:31] you rejoice and you declare the name of
[2:51:34] the lord and you live right and talk
[2:51:36] right and act right come on church
[2:51:41] brother branham told us that an old seed
[2:51:43] potato it has to rot in order for a new
[2:51:46] life to come he said the corn can't
[2:51:48] produce until the seed is rotten and
[2:51:50] that life comes up out of it and he says
[2:51:53] he said a man or woman can never have a
[2:51:56] new birth until their intellectuals and
[2:51:58] their own self is dead and rotten and
[2:52:01] die out at the altar and scream
[2:52:04] and get all messed up to a place the
[2:52:06] starch gets out of your collar and
[2:52:08] you're born again by the spirit of god
[2:52:11] and he said i don't care if you squall
[2:52:13] speak in tongues jump up and down flop
[2:52:16] like a chicken with his head off you're
[2:52:18] bringing forth new life

[2:52:37] oh you know no no no brother tim we we
[2:52:39] don't do that no more
[2:52:41] oh brother branham didn't even do it
[2:52:42] that's a lie here's one of his last
[2:52:44] sermons he said i i want an
[2:52:46] old-fashioned altar call

[2:52:52] in jehovah jiren 64 i believe god's
[2:52:55] going to do some great things tomorrow i
[2:52:57] know i'm hoping he is that's the reason
[2:52:59] i can make altar calls do everything i
[2:53:01] can to find favor with him
[2:53:05] oh
[2:53:06] he says in testimony on the sea we've
[2:53:08] gone off without old-time prayer
[2:53:10] meetings and baptism of the holy ghost
[2:53:12] coming down until the fire is burnt blow
[2:53:14] you can cry out and try to get people to
[2:53:16] the altar and they just walk up like
[2:53:17] they're almost dead a dread to come then
[2:53:20] ask ministers to come pray with them and
[2:53:22] they say oh what did you ask me for and
[2:53:24] they get down you can't hardly get them
[2:53:26] and then and
[2:53:27] and and stand there just for a few
[2:53:30] minutes and look at you and go back and
[2:53:32] sit in their seats to me the fire is
[2:53:34] going out something has happened look
[2:53:36] what we need is revival
[2:53:38] that sinners looking up on christ repent
[2:53:41] run to the altar with their hands up
[2:53:42] screaming for mercy and the whole church
[2:53:45] is a flame of fire with the glory of god

[2:58:31] supposed to be spirit-filled people and
[2:58:32] see altar calls me you couldn't even get
[2:58:35] people to go in with anybody to pray
[2:58:37] with them it shows that ichabod the
[2:58:39] spirit of god is departed but when you
[2:58:41] see that seal and fire and longing and
[2:58:44] long for human souls
[2:58:49] now you remember samson he was raised up
[2:58:51] to destroy the enemy
[2:58:54] is that right we have been raised up to
[2:58:57] destroy the enemy

[2:59:23] is that right
[2:59:24] amen and seven locks there that he had
[2:59:27] nazarite vow that he had unto the lord
[2:59:30] and there when trouble came he could
[2:59:32] just reach back and feel those seven
[2:59:34] locks
[2:59:36] god you've moved through seven spirits
[2:59:38] to seven ages to seven messengers of
[2:59:40] seven churches and i know you're right
[2:59:42] here in this last age
[2:59:45] [Applause]
[2:59:46] hallelujah so when i feel that
[2:59:48] confidence there i know lord you're
[2:59:50] fixing to do something i'm surrounded
[2:59:54] it looks like i'm surrounded
[2:59:56] but i'm surrounded by you
[2:59:59] there may be a thousand fall on this
[3:00:01] side or third ten thousand on this but
[3:00:03] it'll not connive me
[3:00:06] i was born to defeat the enemy
[3:00:10] that's what the church was they were
[3:00:12] born to be serpent bruisers and devil
[3:00:15] defeaters and overcomers
[3:00:21] god raised you up for that purpose
[3:00:24] he ordained you for that reason
[3:00:27] amen he empowered you with a hidden
[3:00:30] power on the inside of you
[3:00:33] amen
[3:00:35] amen oh my you know peter took that
[3:00:38] jawbone of an ass there and struck those
[3:00:40] helmets that would have shattered into a
[3:00:42] thousand pieces but god got in that
[3:00:44] jawbone
[3:00:47] amen he stood there there as long as he
[3:00:50] could reach back and feel those seven
[3:00:52] locks
[3:00:53] god's covenant
[3:00:54] and then jesus christ the same yesterday
[3:00:57] today and forever
[3:00:59] you let the fire in that first stage it
[3:01:01] lit the necks and lit the necks and lit
[3:01:03] the night and we got the same fire that
[3:01:05] was on the day of pentecost
[3:01:08] hallelujah amen nothing should bother
[3:01:10] the church as long as we can feel the
[3:01:12] holy ghost
[3:01:14] the covenant of god's word the works
[3:01:16] that i do shall you do also
[3:01:19] greater than these shall you do

[3:01:35] that's in the world

[3:01:46] and i wonder today if that isn't
[3:01:49] repeated remember he was preaching this
[3:01:50] to his own church
[3:01:53] if we're not seeing it very that very
[3:01:55] thing happened
[3:01:56] the power has been shaved off
[3:02:01] by personality cults
[3:02:04] by hybriding the message
[3:02:06] by forgetting his power
[3:02:09] by taking an easy believism
[3:02:12] rather than a new true new birth
[3:02:14] experience somebody with me
[3:02:16] [Music]
[3:02:17] until it saves the glory off the church
[3:02:23] amen i i remember i remember in one of

[3:09:13] [Music]
[3:09:17] i was talking to a man this week
[3:09:20] he said brother tim i've wasted 20 years
[3:09:23] of my life
[3:09:24] 20 years
[3:09:26] just went down the drain
[3:09:29] so when you was in israel
[3:09:32] you took a picture
[3:09:33] of there the sea of galilee and some of
[3:09:36] the place and you sent it to me
[3:09:40] i got those pictures and i looked at it
[3:09:43] and i wrote you back brother tim
[3:09:45] i'd sure like to see that place
[3:09:50] i said you can
[3:09:52] come on back home
[3:09:53] [Music]
[3:09:57] he said those words saying come on back
[3:09:59] home
[3:10:00] struck me down in my heart
[3:10:03] and i began to move back toward home
[3:10:05] [Music]
[3:10:08] hey man there's a new jerusalem forest
[3:10:13] there's a city whose builder maker is
[3:10:15] god
[3:10:16] oh man you don't have to stay out there
[3:10:18] wondering come on back home
[3:10:21] he'll take you to that city
[3:10:23] he'll take you there that city where
[3:10:25] there's theophanies
[3:10:27] where we never grow old
[3:10:30] there's no sickness no pain
[3:10:33] no sorrow of death
[3:10:35] and those in theophany come here
[3:10:37] and we in
[3:10:38] flesh meet our theophany
[3:10:41] and we're changed from mortal
[3:10:43] to immortality
[3:10:45] [Music]
[3:10:50] but that change
[3:10:52] starts right here at the altar
[3:10:55] at the altar of your heart
[3:10:58] is not so important this altar
[3:11:01] but for you to find a real replace of
[3:11:03] repentance
[3:11:04] in your heart
[3:11:06] while your head's about just for a
[3:11:08] moment
[3:11:09] [Music]
[3:11:10] your thoughts on him
[3:11:12] [Music]

[3:11:30] laodicean spirit
[3:11:32] [Music]
[3:11:36] something that's taken you out of the
[3:11:38] company of saints
[3:11:40] took you away from christ

[3:17:51] your grace
[3:18:00] oh
[3:18:01] lord
[3:18:03] please
[3:18:04] light the fire
[3:18:07] [Music]
[3:18:20] [Music]
[3:18:33] fear
[3:18:36] [Music]
[3:18:46] your face
[3:18:48] is
[3:18:54] [Music]
[3:19:04] your
[3:19:06] grace abounds
[3:19:09] in me
[3:19:12] and i want to take your
[3:19:16] word and shine it all around but first
[3:19:22] help me just
[3:19:26] to live it lord
[3:19:30] and when i'm doing
[3:19:34] well
[3:19:35] help me never seek a crown for my reward

[3:19:44] to you

[3:20:06] for
[3:20:07] when your eyes
[3:20:11] [Music]
[3:20:26] [Music]
[3:20:36] burn
[3:20:37] bright and clean
[3:20:42] renew
[3:20:45] the lamp
[3:20:47] of my
[3:20:49] first love

[3:21:27] your grace
[3:21:30] abounds
[3:21:32] in me
[3:21:34] [Music]
[3:21:38] i believe it was in 1964 brother branham
[3:21:41] would say
[3:21:43] i'm not looking for a revival
[3:21:46] but i'm looking for the rapture
[3:21:49] and we could take that out of context
[3:21:52] because it's going to take a revival to
[3:21:54] bring on a rapture
[3:21:56] not a revival like the world may think a
[3:21:59] revival would be with a lot of shouting
[3:22:02] and a lot of different things
[3:22:04] but a deep revival
[3:22:07] a knowledge of god that you've met with
[3:22:09] god that you know that you've died out
[3:22:12] that there's something in you that's
[3:22:14] different it moves you
[3:22:17] friends it's not just a church revival
[3:22:20] it's a personal revival
[3:22:22] it's a revival that you take home with
[3:22:24] you
[3:22:25] it's a revival on monday morning
[3:22:28] when you get on your knees and you open
[3:22:30] the book and lord there's a day ahead of
[3:22:32] me today
[3:22:33] now lord let me live for you today
[3:22:36] and i'll tell you what that's the
[3:22:38] revival that we're looking for and when
[3:22:40] we all come that way to church
[3:22:43] then you'll see a revival that will make
[3:22:45] a difference in our services that'll
[3:22:48] make a difference in the way we worship
[3:22:50] that'll bring a a passion back into it
[3:22:53] that'll bring an expectation
[3:22:56] how many of you would say i i desire
[3:22:59] that
[3:23:01] and and if you're honest and say
[3:23:03] was there a time i was closer to god
[3:23:05] than i am today
[3:23:08] and i think brother brown i mean what
[3:23:10] house will you build me we quoted this
[3:23:12] yesterday
[3:23:13] oh for that feeling i had when i first
[3:23:17] was saved
[3:23:18] [Music]
[3:23:19] friends that's the thing that we need
[3:23:22] when god is walking with you
[3:23:25] yeah we'll have our ups and our downs
[3:23:27] we'll have our trials
[3:23:28] but i'll say this when you're walking
[3:23:30] with him and and the birds sound
[3:23:33] different and and and and the world
[3:23:36] doesn't have the allure and the
[3:23:37] attraction you're not halfway in you're
[3:23:40] not halfway out but you're walking with
[3:23:42] him when his power flows through you
[3:23:45] when his words come through you when
[3:23:48] it's him
[3:23:49] doing all of these things that's the
[3:23:51] revival
[3:23:53] so the question
[3:23:54] is there a hope for a revival
[3:23:57] how many would say there is
[3:24:00] how many knows we've got something to do
[3:24:03] we heard it many times just die out
[3:24:06] we need to die out
[3:24:08] why don't we present ourselves to the
[3:24:10] lord tonight
[3:24:13] not not just
[3:24:14] a workup of a revival
[3:24:17] a prophet would tell us very clearly
[3:24:20] that the
[3:24:21] there's a way and there's a highway
[3:24:23] there's a highway and a way
[3:24:25] and down the middle is the way
[3:24:27] you go to one side you become
[3:24:29] intellectual
[3:24:31] you come to the other side you become
[3:24:32] emotional
[3:24:34] but the real gospel is right down the
[3:24:37] middle
[3:24:39] amen
[3:24:40] oh lord take these hands
[3:24:43] make yourself a sacrifice tonight just
[3:24:45] as we'll just sing a course or two but
[3:24:48] let's sing this
[3:24:50] and let's say lord i'm giving myself to
[3:24:52] you
[3:24:55] take these hands
[3:24:59] and lift them up
[3:25:04] for i have not the strength
[3:25:11] [Music]
[3:25:15] [Applause]
[3:25:16] [Music]
[3:25:17] i have nothing
[3:25:19] [Applause]

[3:28:59] amen as you're playing softly as we just
[3:29:02] bow our heads
[3:29:04] the early disciples
[3:29:07] were very distinguished
[3:29:10] they took notice that they'd been with
[3:29:12] jesus
[3:29:16] brother branham would talk about
[3:29:19] an amish woman that he met in a meeting
[3:29:21] one time
[3:29:24] him and sister mita and he said
[3:29:26] did you see her
[3:29:28] her spirit was clean
[3:29:31] it was clear
[3:29:33] she'd been somewhere
[3:29:36] friends do you want to be there
[3:29:38] how many are tired of the world
[3:29:41] how many are tired of having your foot
[3:29:44] in the world halfway and halfway in
[3:29:46] church when you get sick and tired of it
[3:29:50] and you say lord all i want is you
[3:29:53] i believe he'll meet you right there
[3:29:59] how did some of these demon possessions
[3:30:01] happen
[3:30:03] because they just opened up to
[3:30:06] how does christ come in
[3:30:09] when you die out to those things and say
[3:30:11] lord i don't want that
[3:30:13] i don't want the world i want you
[3:30:16] [Music]
[3:30:18] i don't know how many of you were
[3:30:19] praying you come here
[3:30:22] we rub shoulders with the world
[3:30:26] we get scarred we get
[3:30:28] cold we get indifferent
[3:30:31] oh we need a refilling of the holy ghost
[3:30:35] i need a refilling
[3:30:37] it's not good enough to have it a week
[3:30:39] ago two weeks ago
[3:30:41] we're living in a time where you need it
[3:30:43] every day
[3:30:44] there has to be a fountain
[3:30:47] it's open
[3:30:50] just lingering a few moments we're going
[3:30:51] to dismiss you
[3:30:54] stay in this atmosphere
[3:30:58] allow god to minister to you
[3:31:02] so your heads are bowed and if you're
[3:31:04] just hungry
[3:31:06] you're hungry for the lord
[3:31:08] i believe he'll meet you
[3:31:11] we need friends
[3:31:13] the revival starts
[3:31:15] at the altar of our heart
[3:31:17] you might come to the altar here
[3:31:20] but sometimes you come out of guilt
[3:31:22] sometimes you come out of conscience
[3:31:25] but why don't you right where you're
[3:31:27] seated
[3:31:28] right where you're standing right now

[3:31:39] hearing me
[3:31:40] i'm tired of where i was this last week
[3:31:44] i'm tired of
[3:31:45] these demons that would oppress me
[3:31:48] i'm tired of just a lukewarm life
[3:31:53] is there a hope yes there's a hope

[3:35:25] together with them with
[3:35:27] that go out into the tributarians and
[3:35:30] off of the amazon river
[3:35:32] and over the last five or six years
[3:35:34] they've baptized over a thousand people
[3:35:37] out of that region
[3:35:39] and god is really doing and moving and
