visitors alike and i think we're coming to a time where we're not going to be visitors we're just going to be all one and i'm looking forward to it i believe that's what's happening among the people of god we're looking this weekend just to draw aside have a time and a conference a meeting with god be able to worship him and praise him be able to let go and enjoy ourselves rejoice and then look to him for what he has for us in our souls and i believe he has great things in store for us so i want to welcome you it's so good to see such a spirit of expectation we have many visitors here

and all the various churches we have visitors here from calgary we have visitors from from grand prairie we have from the edmonton area we have our our local churches i just want to make mention manifested word assembly it's brother jerry fury we also have edmonton living word fellowship by the eugene braun and restored word fellowship brother ziglar these brothers have graciously cancelled their services this weekend to be part of these meetings and i i just want to say god bless you i believe that's a real christian spirit and and we thank god for that and uh there's many many more that are listening in streaming so we welcome you wherever you're at and and and and these brothers have been faithful some amongst us these brothers uh you know brother ron said he he passed it on to a brother in europe who passed it on to africa past the night is that all right i said that's fine that's really good and we're happy to do that so god bless you those that are streaming uh we've been praying and there's expectation here and not only those that are from the local churches but if you are here for the first time i just want to say we're a bible believing church we believe in the full gospel we believe in in in what the apostolic doctrine was and we believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so we we just are looking for god to come and make himself real just a couple of announcements i've i've got here and and i want to just say is that if you're parking to our local church if you're coming a little earlier and you park down the street leave our parking lot for for the visitors amongst us um we've also there's a there's a mechanic shop kitty corner from here the one of our brothers was talking to him they've agreed to give us that parking lot we are dealing with construction in the street in front of us and we're in the process of expanding our parking lot over the next little while but for now let's just do our best let's work together and do that if you can so we we just want to welcome you all also just want to make a quick mention that the washrooms for anybody that can go downstairs if you're not able to go down the stairs there's a a washroom we use for the elderly the the those that can't make it downstairs down the hall but if you can use the ones downstairs and we would thank you for it these meetings just i'm going to take just a few minutes this will be the only time i do this and i just want to say this these meetings were really started years ago by brother harold hildebrandt in 1985. he felt it on his heart to have a missionary convention and we had a number of brothers come from around the world this was at a time when we did not have internet streaming we we couldn't get together and and we would start that as a five-day set of meetings starting on a wednesday would go through and we would have missionary brothers and it was as i was just speaking to the brothers in the back office it was a tremendous time it was a time that was very formative brothers we had friendships we began to meet people it was a real coming together of the bride of christ and that was now 37 years ago and we had regular missionary meetings every three years for a number of years but then in between we had what we called our annual meetings and this is the same time so we're doing that again all these years later and this year we have three speakers and the the elder statesman i'm gonna have to call him that is brother tim pruitt brother brother tim brother tim preached at our meetings in 1988 and he made me aware of that and i remembered the message he preached and uh so he was he said i was he was 34 years old at the time and uh that was 34 years ago so if you're good at math you you'd have an idea of how old he is so we want to we just want to say we're we r we're happy to have him back we haven't had up to this year we hadn't had brother tim pruitt here for many years and we were so happy that he came to be a part of the memorial service for brother harold we were blessed by that and prior to him even coming we already had made arrangements for him to be the speaker this year and it had been so many years and we felt it was just good for him to be back in edmonton again the other long-standing fixture i'll call him here is his brother ron spencer he's he's been a part of our meetings for many years he he occupies a big part of our hearts and uh in all the times that he's come here now including other trips other meetings this is his 25th trip to edmonton 25 years welcome home [Music] the last two years we had a uh video a meeting with him he couldn't travel and i would just say uh you know he wasn't sure if he'd ever be back but i'll say this there's nothing like the real deal i i'm happy you're here in in body and presence and we met him at the airport yesterday and his wife sister connie is here and it was so good to see them and and uh brother ron it was just so good to give you a hug and and uh see it and you know the one thing about internet streaming you can't partake of tim horton's coffee uh you can't eat saskatoon berry pie so it's more than just being here in person you got to live it you got to experience it and and and that's just the humorous side of it but but we love brother ron and and we appreciate sister connie being here and we're going to take a little more time with him but when brother tim pruitt accepted our invitation and and since last year when his wife passed brother he's had his son timothy uh travel with him and hearing that he would be here we we thought brother timothy has a gift in his life and you know he he'll be speaking a couple services for us he he'll be speaking a youth meeting that we're going to have saturday afternoon here at the church at 1 30 but we also felt we needed to hear him as a congregation so he's going to speak for us tonight and you know when when brother tim was here in 1988 i think brother timothy was only 10 years old at the time and he never knew what he had there but we're so glad and and you know i'd say this he's the opening night speaker but he's not a warm-up act brother timothy is a preacher a man of god and i will just say this to you don't wait for the other services start start tonight just just enter in well we're gathered here and and i would like to just say even though these are regular meetings i'd like to say they're anything but regular it's been two years of covid we are seeing a world that is falling apart we we are seeing spirits that are rising up that are being loosed upon the people we are seeing darkness that is unprecedented and when brother branham would talk about a darkness the bible talks about a gross darkness we are seeing it on on levels that we've never seen it before and in the midst of all of this god has promised that he would raise the standard and i believe what we're just saying about a new testament church i believe that's promised that ephesus that the the alpha would become the omega the ephesian church that fell off would come from where they fell off to finish what god had intended and i believe we're at that point so i i just want to encourage you don't look at it as just regular meetings and this city in the last week has had a large religious gathering and it affected traffic it was much publicized in the media and i would say this meeting has gone relatively unnoticed by those measures but i would also like to say that this meeting i believe that heaven has taken notice i believe that hell has taken notice and i believe that it had it has a greater significance than maybe what the world saw this last week and i would just like to say the god of heaven i believe is here he knows we would be here he knew the time he knew the speakers he knew our situations and i want to encourage you friends let's just look to god in these meetings these brothers as much as i love these brothers as much as i appreciate them these are men of god but beyond the mask there's a gift and i would say we're not looking to just brother ron we're not just looking to brother tim or brother timothy but we're looking to the mighty god and i want you to be reminded if you can we we had a a in this in 1963 a man of god came and announced a series of meetings on the opening of the seven seals and he was he said i can't do it only the lamb can open that and he announced these meetings beforehand and to the very day he didn't even know what he was going to speak but god came on the scene and i say that god is still the god today and i want to encourage you to pull on that god whatever you have need of and i would say there are great needs we are depending on him for these meetings and i don't know how he'll come when he'll come but i believe he'll come because he's been invited so having said all of that i i just want to say we're looking to him and if i can i want to just share this and then i'm going to have we're going to stand and we'll have our brother timothy come but a brother in our in our minister group he shared this prayer of brother branham uh earlier this this this week and i uh i just felt to share it and it would it so spoke to me and i i wanted to just just just bring it to all of you and i'm just i had it and then i i went somewhere else but i've got it now so this is brother branham speaking in a message and uh the message is in in 1965 in january a paradox and i want to just read part of this prayer brother brahms said we'd say and now we're about to approach the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us may it be again lord that the word will become flesh that it will pour through thy church and thy people to fulfill the promises of this hour we realize we're in the closing time time is running out and we're blending in with eternity the civilization has traveled from east to west there's no place to go father we pray heavenly father that this will be a great hour for us that we may sense the presence of the holy spirit the writer of this word back in the building of the tabernacle of flesh manifesting himself to us pardoning our sins forgiven our iniquity and the assurance he will not impute sin to the believer and with the assurance that he would heal our infirmities take people out of wheelchairs and off of crutches give them sight them that are blind and an extension of days those that are dying with horrible diseases like cancer and tuberculocar advanced diseases that the physicians cannot curb it's beyond that but god you go beyond scientific research you go beyond reasoning grant to your servants this afternoon the speaking and hearing of the word and he begins to speak the message a paradox i believe that same god is real i believe he's going to make himself known in our midst let's stand together we're going to invite our brother timothy pruitt we're looking for a great time in the lord let's pull on the gift like to sing tonight just as we do leaning on the everlasting arms if we can take that brother marion you lead us what a fellowship [Music] [Music] safe and secure [Applause] [Music] [Applause] us [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh how bright [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] feeding on [Music] on the everlasting arms [Music] yes i'm cleaning what have i to fear [Applause] yes [Applause] hallelujah how many is leaning on the arms of the beloved what a place to be amen amen it's great to be with you tonight and to be in these meetings with you we're looking for god to do amazing things because he's an amazing god hallelujah uh someone that sent me actually brother buzzbosia from uganda sent me this quote earlier this week while we was preparing for these meetings and just like to read this as we start says the reason i like these full gospel conventions you hear the people cry shout praise the lord because they've come into fellowship a divine fellowship of the holy spirit he said whenever you get rid of that you're going back to babylon you might as well bury yourself that's exactly right but when we get to a place to where we get away from that shekinah glory that praises of god that fresh anointing and breaks down all religious barriers and things and makes us want in christ jesus it frees us from all condemnation that's what we need tonight that's what the church needs divine fellowship he said that's what i found in these conventions in places where men and women they're not ashamed they're not ashamed of the gospel they're ready to testify they're ready to sing about it they're ready to shout about it hallelujah said i've even heard them speak in tongues once in a while i believe we can have that kind of convention amen god bless you today been in much prayer for these meetings it's an honor to be with you and to be ministering of course with two of my heroes amen and uh amen just so thankful amen to be here with you bring greetings from our home assembly from my wife sister ruth and my family many said to give you greetings god bless you tonight amen let's just go to him in prayer how many would have a need just want to make it known to the lord [Music] father here we are in these opening meetings this opening service the lord we know that you're here lord we've already witnessed you your presence the spirit of god moving among us lord we we want to enter into that shekinah glory lord in that divine fellowship with you father lord there were hands that were lifted up lord saying i have a need well i know you are a need meeting god lord you're here this weekend this is a conference you've called lord many to have a special visitation from you we asked lord that you would be visible among us your pillar of fire to move among us lord discern the thoughts and intents of the heart work miracles among his healings lord deliverances father lord to be those that backslid may they come back to you father lord if we're lukewarm may our fire be lit and kindled up again father lord we're just asking for a special outpouring of your spirit for lord we've been through many dangerous toils and snares lord these last couple of years seemingly just more and more on every side and every hand loss of love when sick one sickness things happening all around us but lord through it all god we can say your grace has brought us safe this far and your grace is going to lead us all the way god we commit this service to your hand this weekend father anointed service anointing song each prayer that's prayed each word this spoke lord may you be the the speaker and the hearer lord we pray we love you father with all of our hearts may you me be the most welcome guest lord among us we ask it in jesus name amen amen amen we can turn our bibles to job chapter 5. hey man like to speak to you tonight just as i was looking at some things trying to look to see what which direction they go you know there's many directions but you want to find the right direction and and uh it's there's never really uh you always have something you can preach on but you want the right something to preach on and so we just looking at some things and i felt the lord directed us to go this way i'd like to speak to you on the day of miracles it's our turn amen it's our turn amen it's very interesting the song where they had brought me up here to leaning on the everlasting arms was actually a song that was sang one sunday morning at our church it was a little 96 pound frail woman bound with cancer stage four hodgkin's lymphoma but she realized this service is my turn and here in that verse what have i to dread what have i to fear the spirit of the lord fell on her and out of her seat she came and around and around that building she went and and it was prophesied over her as she came by maryam your enemy is dead amen the next day she goes to the doctor and all the cancer was gone amen it's our turn how many can say lord i want my turn amen i want my turn job chapter 5 and verse 8 said i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my calls which does great things and unsearchable marvelous things without number amen we let you be seated a god who does great things unsearchable things marvelous things but things with that has no number you know i read i want to read a quote as we start this out when god talked to moses brother branham would say this and it's a very wonderful statement more than just a statement but he said i believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit power signs and wonders this great power pouring out of god's spirit in the last days and he said that's the thing that'll bring faith into the people that'll take a rapture in faith that'll take the church into glory but the age has come now amen i believe this time to quit putting it off to another time or to a time in the past but today is the date and that this hour is the hour that we are to witness the miraculous the phenomenal amen the pouring out of god's spirit he said in the last days i'll pour out my spirit saith the lord signs and wonders the great pouring out of god's spirit in the last days and that's what has been released to this age what has been released to this age is the phenomenal what has been released to this age is the miraculous it is the baptism of the holy spirit that's been released again as it was on the day of pentecost just as po as he poured out the miraculous in the first age and the first exodus and the first signs and the first wonders he's also pouring them out in this time that we live in now i want to look at the exodus because i believe we're in another exodus we're in a time of leaving here amen it's a time of the body change it's the time of the rapture it's a time of the cult going home with the saints of god so but as we look in the time we're living in you want to know how god is today you go back and see what he was yesterday because what he was yesterday he will be again today because he is the same yesterday today and forever so if you want to see how god feels about healing go see what he felt 20 years ago 30 years ago 100 years ago 2 000 years ago he still feels the same way today if you want to see what he feels like about deliverances or salvation or anything that you have a need of if you want to know what he feels like or how he his attributes are or how he acts go see what he did then because he's still the same today and so we can see in the first exodus as we look amen there was a phenomenal thing that was poured out the pillar of fire came down amen the the prophet began to speak there was a word that was spoke amen said let my people go and he came and he showed himself personally with signs with wonders amen in the first exodus now we know again in the second exodus says he would take the people out of judaism into into the baptism of the holy ghost into the word of god he would also pour out the phenomenal there would be miracles that would take place there would be signs and wonders there'd be a light that would appear on the river jordan it would be a word that would go forth and say let my people go and in the third exodus it's been the same thing it's been a repeat amen we have the same anointing we have the same pillar of fire we have the same word that says let my people go so if you're under some kind of situation today are you under some kind of a problem in your life there is a word that is hanging over you that says let my people go you don't have to stay where you're at you don't have to stay bound you don't have to say in the situation that you are there is a word for your deliverance amen if you're depressed tonight there is a word for your deliverance if you're sick tonight there is a word for your deliverance whatever you have need of there is a word for it and he came and showed himself personally now i want you to understand that that same pillar of fire is still among us even now it is still doing the miraculous it is still changing lives it is still healing the sick it is still raising the dead amen we'd be blind as a bat tonight if we can say we try to say god doesn't still do the miraculous why you have one of the greatest miracles sitting right here in front of you that the devil has tried to kill over and over but god is a god of miracles amen he's a god that can move away obstacles out of our lives many of you no doubt faced obstacles to come to this meeting and you wondered how it was going to happen but god came on the scene for you because he's a god of miracles he came to move now we can see as brother brown we bring it down in the third exodus he would say the holy spirit in the form of the pillar of fire coming down and manifestations brought the first exodus and brought israel out of egypt the second exodus was christ bringing the church out of judaism the third exodus was the same pillar of fire takes a bride from the church wanted out of the natural what out of the spiritual the spiritual out of the church what was it he wanted a spiritual people to work spiritual things through so he had to have a supernatural people to believe in the supernatural amen if you don't believe in the supernatural that means you are not a supernatural person but if you have been born of the supernatural if you have been born of the pillar of fire you will believe the very works of god because that life lives on the inside of you amen if i can have just a little more up here amen see god fulfilling his word backing it up by the miraculous you say well we have the word today wonderful but you cannot separate the word from the miraculous amen where he is the miraculous is always present amen in this generation under the third pole it has produced miracles you know in the third pool the third pole that we're under amen the miracle working god showed us what was in this third pool that the dead fish was raised squirrels were created storms were spoke out of existence tumors were spoke out of existence salvation given to hattie wright's boys amen nothing but the miraculous but have you ever noticed they say day they say days of miracles are passed they're not always saying god can't do miracles but the day has passed amen the day has passed but listen to this he says the day of miracles is not passed as the day the theologians say if the days of miracles is passed the day of god has passed god is a miracle [Applause] he said when was they say when the days of miracles were passed he said when the days of miracles has passed the day of god has passed for god is miracles and the days of miracles never will be passed never was and never will be never was and never will be he is a god of miracles therefore where he is present miracles are present where he is present healings is present salvation is present amen the holy ghost is present the word of god is present everything that he is is present [Applause] amen in the first exodus god called an exodus a separation from where they were at the present time and god is re making ready to fulfill his divine promised word that he gave abraham isaac and jacob now years had passed since god had given a promise and it seemed like it was not going to happen it seemed impossible uh brother branham would even make the statement that that exodus seemed more impossible than ours does he said it seemed so impossible that 400 years had went by and there seemed to be no hope here they were slaves now here they were in bad situation there seemed to be no way out he said in but in the season the due time god will always make his promise right so whatever you're holding on to tonight don't give up on it amen it hasn't been 400 years yet amen it may have been 20 years 40 years whatever it is two years don't ever give up on it because he will bring it to pass he will fulfill his word you can rest assured that what god has promised he's going to do it that gives me a great hope tonight because he promised a body change it may look impossible but he said it was going to happen and he's going to bring it to pass [Applause] he's going to do it don't need to try to think anything else well maybe the prophet was wrong or maybe it couldn't maybe it could happen in this day looked at almost impossible then he said more impossible than it does now but god did it anyhow hallelujah because he promised he would do it look how simple he does it i have come down i have heard your cry i have remembered my promise and i have come down to fulfill it hallelujah don't you ever think that god hasn't heard your cry don't you say don't you ever think that god hasn't heard your moaning and your worry and all the things that the pressures of this life has put on you don't you ever think god doesn't know about it he knows about every situation in your life he knows about every moment of your life and he has he has orchestrated some meetings on this weekend to say i have heard your cry and i have come down to deliver you [Applause] listen i'm not talking to the next person on the pew next to you i'm talking to you when you realize amen god has come down for me not my daddy oh lord not my mama oh lord not the pastor not somebody else but god has come down for me he's come to show himself for my behalf [Applause] i have come down i'm going to be with you hallelujah i'm with you my never failing presence will be with you wherever you go don't be afraid i'm coming down to the liver let's just go ahead and shout about that amen i'm coming down not to twiddle my thumbs not to look and see how bad you got it not to look and pat you on the shoulder and say it's going to be okay i am coming down to deliver i am coming down to hill i am coming down to fill with the holy ghost i am coming down to do the miraculous because this is the time for the miraculous [Applause] [Music] how faith can catch a hold there god is going to do it look at your neighbor and say god's going to do it he's going to do it he promised he would no matter how bad it looks what the circumstances look like what anybody says god said so [Applause] god said he was going to do it it goes beyond the understanding of a cultured mind and we try to read and say well how could it be well you tell me how could it be one moment a little 96 year old 96 pound woman sitting on the back seat back there bound up with cancer stage four lymphoma hodgkin's lymphoma harley's so frail and weak couldn't hardly but she wanted to come to church she shows up you tell me how it could be so that in the meeting a song we begin to sing after it had been preached god is the god the god of the bible is here today amen and god is doing extreme things [Applause] let me tell you that god wasn't just there he wasn't just god on that sunday he's got here tonight on a thursday night maybe your faith is weak and maybe you're shriveled up spiritually speaking and you've been ate up by some cancer some bitterness some unforgiving spirit but if you begin to realize what have i to dread what have i to fear if i just lean on the arms of my beloved hallelujah if i would just lean on him and cast my cares on him because he cares for me and let him take control of this situation [Applause] hallelujah we got a lot of people sitting on pews ate up with cancer and i ain't talking about physically either uh oh let's get back to the days of miracles what's the greatest miracle that could ever take place is a spiritual cancer that's in somebody and it's eating their soul up to where they can't even fellowship no more and they can't be around people and they got unforgiveness in their heart hey man that's the worst kind of cancer there is is unforgiveness grudges and things they want to hold and they want to hold on to and they won't let things go from 20 years ago let it go you say you say well what what if i'd let it go they're going to go free and no you're going to go free i want you to understand something and unforgiveness they are not the prisoner you are hey you can read right here that wasn't in my notes but we there okay that cancer is killing you and i'm not here to offer you something that's going to have some bad side effects as the doctor would try to do and that's all they got and thank god for doctors but i i got something better than that i got an inoculation [Applause] it ain't five percent uh effective it ain't 50 percent effective it ain't 99.9 it's a hundred percent effective [Applause] you know that's what amazed me is people will line up and they'll line up for a drug to put in their arms maybe 90 i don't know what percentage you can say this thing that we're dealing with is effective i don't have no idea no neither does anybody else but they'll line up for it and it's got side effects and it has issues and it causes all things and they're because you know why they're doing it and i'm not trying to get political here but we're here and we're just going to go this first service you know while they're doing it because they're scared of a disease that you have about a 99 point something percent a chance of surviving something don't compute and that's where they're at and they're scared to death of it fear is taking over people's lives and it ain't just out there it's taking over people's lives in the church house all of a sudden social distance became a word it became something that we and began not not even realizing they began to social distance themselves not just from people but from god [Music] amen and they they they line up because of their fear and they got a 99 whatever percent chance of surviving and i'm not making light of it my wife had a bad case of it spending yeah weeks in the hospital came very close to death amen but listen i got there's something out there that's worse than covet it's called the layout to see and flu [Applause] it's got a 100 percent kill rate [Applause] it's got a hundred percent of taking good boys and good girls straight to hell but there is an inoculation for it there is something that you can take that'll inoculate from you from there to seal and you won't be pulled down by it no more and you won't be bothered by its creeds and his dress codes and all the things that goes with it because you have been inoculated [Applause] people need to have more fear about something that's a 100 percent death rate but they twiddle their thumbs and whistle in the graveyard like nothing's going on and here we are at the cusp of the rapture hallelujah that's all free he said i don't mean to say he said people began to reason he said i don't mean to say a man with a fine education and a strong mind that man can't understand it that's all right wonderful as long as he uses that to not to reason but he uses it to believe god he said when a man tries to reason it couldn't be done that drives him away from god constantly all the time when he's trying to listen to his own understanding if if you don't understand the bible says a certain thing just punctuated with an amen and let it go like that we don't have to understand everything but you got to believe what he said we get this idea of in the time that we're living in that we got to know everything we got such a world of knowledge and we got to know it listen with god you're not going to ever know everything you're not going to know why you're not going to know how come you're not going to know all the questions but the deal you've got to do is i believe it [Applause] i believe what he said the first exodus he said why were they down in egypt to begin with why would god's people be out of the land that god had promised them god had promised them at the beginning with abraham and isaac and jacob and god give them that land and said this is it why would people not be in the place god has provided them brother branham says this in right there he said that's the question of today also he said god give us a pentecost he give us a book of acts he give us the holy spirit to lead and guide us he give us a land why are we out of it why is the church out of it why is a great christian church today living why isn't it living again like it was in the book of acts bringing forth the same thing there's some reason for it they went down to egypt all because of the jealousy of a brother that's the reason is israel was in egypt at that time and out of the land remember god promises it was only as long as they stayed in the land now they have a physical land we have a spiritual land our promises belong in that land but he was taken from his brothers because he was spiritual joseph he was a great man maybe and lay you know humble but great man and they hated him without a cause they should have respected him but they hated him why because he was a brother he was somebody that they thought well surely if god was going to use somebody they wouldn't use my brother you know it's it it's real hard to get behind behind beyond all this veil called humanity we're good about getting beyond our own veil but other people's veil we're good about seeing god in ourselves you know and we oh i see god i see god but then god comes and he begins to preach and speak to you and he steps on our toes well that couldn't be god somebody had to tell him that somebody must have told him that what i've been doing and what i've been yes somebody has it's called the angel of god that's been in your bed chamber my dad always said it like this he said you know if people are going to believe that i sit there and tell other ministers what to preach and well i got this problem in my church and if you minister on this that'll help and if you go down this road that'll help and he said they'll believe all that they'll believe also i paid him extra money to do it all of a sudden it becomes not god anymore well somebody told him what i was doing listen we ought to know by now by bible readers that god knows what goes on in your house he knows what god amen what was it there was a prophet in the land that was telling the king of israel what was being said in this kingdom of syria's bed chamber god knows what you're doing he knows where you're at he knows if you're real he knows if you're not he knows where you're up or where you're down he knows all about you [Applause] he knows you more than your pastor knows you he had god had given this man spiritual understanding he could interpret dreams he could foretell what would come to pass and and he didn't pull no punches he saw the dream of those sheaves bowing before his sheep and his brothers got angry with him said well i guess then you little holy rover we'll bow down before you someday that's and that's the way it happened how those big giants ever bow down for that little insignificant fella but they did it they sure did and pleaded for mercy but he hadn't come into power yet you see he was only their brother just only brother so and so it's only sister so and so but when we find out by doing this joseph was taken and he was sold into egypt and and he went down there and he said see what was happening he said we realize as long as they dwelt in the dwelling place and the spirit of god would move he said that's a good thing stay in that place he said but when they moved they got rid of the spirit the funny and it goes on the fundamentals that they positionally know where they are by intellectual conception of the bible but there's no spirit they rejected joseph they turned him out they don't want nothing to do with him because that's just a bunch of holy rollers we don't want nothing to do with it and they excommunicate him and sold him out to the world and he they wanted him out of their fellowship he said the story of this these jealous brothers is certainly a great comparison with the spiritual side of it today we're all aware of it that's pure jealousy he said not pure it's old dirty filthy jealousy there's no purity and jealousy there's nothing but filthy jealousy when we see the same bible the same nature of god that wrote the bible vindicated and turned that down without reason that's not pure that's dirty jealousy you watch god heal the sick you watch god raise the dead and that same god that lived in the days of the apostles the same god that they wrote about him the same god that was in their spiritual journey it's doing the same thing today and they're jealous of it and they excommunicate it and they run them off he said that brother thought well we'll never have a use for him but brother like this why not get rid of him he said that's what the same thing has happened today they think because our churches have become intellectual we got the best dressed crowds we got the biggest organization we got the smartest ministers that we have no use of the holy spirit in the way that it was back there uh-oh and in other words actions speak louder than words they're seminaries they're they're they're they're coming together and discussing things and are more able with more of their own intellectual minds to set the church in order and it's better than what the holy spirit can do so they don't need the holy spirit no longer it's something that we don't need today the days of that is past don't need the holy spirit this is a direct quote we don't need the holy spirit to heal the sick we've got doctors we don't need the holy spirit to speak in tongues we're all intellectual people and when you take that out from your framework you've taken the lifeline you've taken the lifeline jesus said it to the jews the stone that was rejected as a chief cornerstone you see what i mean he said see you have taken the spirit of god out and you adopted some man-made system to take the place of the holy ghost therefore there is a people that's elected that has their names on the book of life they will never go for that i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them there's people whose names are on the blam's book of life they can't go for that [Applause] they are spiritually minded therefore they'll never go for it they can't stand it no matter if their father leaves their mother leaves whatever they won't stand for it he said they may not speak that right out like that but their actions prove it the holy spirit proves is amongst those when he gets them gathered together that he still heals the sick he still raises the dead he still speaks with tongues he still cast out devils but the church feels that it don't need the holy spirit the church will tell you that and men can stand up and give you such an intellectual talk it'll make you almost believe it didn't jesus say the two would be so close together it would deceive the very elected if it's possible the intellectual talks would be so smooth it would deceive people it's gospel it's men who can handle the word in such a way they'll make almost any intellectual person if you're trusting in their intellectuals they would condemn the holy spirit and take it away of men take the way of men he said that's the same thing they thought about joseph they got rid of him and down into egypt how we think oh my he says down in egypt they went he said you could stay here for three years and never leave that subject day and night and still be finding the great kernels of the holy spirit the spiritual mind can look down in egypt and see that persecution rise can see joseph taken away in order that that persecution could arise and see god with his wills and the wheels everything moving perfectly see potiphar see all of the things taking place he said how we can see that the church has cut as we can realize we have been positionally placed in a land don't leave the land [Applause] this is the land of the holy ghost this is the land of divine healing amen in this there is prayer lines in this there is altar calls in this there is land hold hands on the sick and they shall recover don't leave the land god told moses said you go and i'll send an angel before you and he's going to keep you in the way and bring in the place i've prepared beware of him obey his voice for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him the angel was the angel of the covenant which was christ jesus the people many of them did not believe it those who did not believe perished those who did not believe went those who did believe went on into the promised land and the men who reject light went into total darkness i believe today that those who reject the holy spirit the light of god and the days of miracles and so forth will go out into total darkness because they are rejecting the very light giver calling it just emotions calling it all kind of dirty names calling it well that's just pentecostal i agree i am pentecostal but i have you to know i've never been in a pentecostal denominational church never preached in one never saying one as far as i know never been in one of their services i don't know how they act i don't know nothing about them but i do know i have witnessed the same pillar of fire that fell 2 000 years ago on the day of pentecost [Applause] and i know what it does it'll change your life forever [Applause] listen it still has the same effect on your life if you receive it it'll do to you what it did to them because it's the same god with the same works on the same side and the same wonders moving among his people when they reject the light they reject the holy ghost they reject the movement of the spirit they reject the miracle worker the very one that can heal them the very one that can deliver them the very one that can set them free they don't want nothing to do with it you know it was a story an event brother branham had as he was at night got lost turned around in the woods on his horse and he came up to this old burn over he said it was a moonlit night and it was pretty spooky place plus a place like that's pretty spooky i'd say even in daylight but at night it makes things worse it's pretty spooky winds were beginning to blow and he'd hear this mournful sound i heard it myself me and brother baker doug baker went up on on the edge of tucson up to the mount lemmon we sat on the top of that mountain they had a fire uh maybe the year before it was burnt over down below us and that wind began to come up up that mountain you hear those sounds in the more dead trees [Music] creaking and carrying on because they're dead brother brown said that was a spooky place he said but i began to notice as that wind blows underneath those trees with some little leaves that were frolicking around you see that new growth that was coming up and he said it put me in mind of a good old-fashioned god sent holy ghost revival [Applause] he said he said in one place you can look it up he said there was it was wonderful and there was those under there there was frolicking there was those above it that was moaning same wind [Applause] hey man the same thing happens in the church that when the holy ghost to come it'll make some moan and it makes them shout it'll make some pouty to make some smile it'll make some sad or make some happy it'll make some jad dance and be joyful in the things of god it'll make other sours they can be [Applause] amen he said it makes me think of a godsend holy ghost revival when signs and wonders begin to come into the church those big old trees those old they i don't believe in them things that's fanaticism that's the days of miracles are passed the wind whistling down the same one that made the moan has given the others a good frolic [Applause] he said when you shook that tree every time he gets to shake it it loosens up the roots so it can grow down and get a better hold hallelujah that's what we need tonight it's a good old time holy ghost shaking get down to glory to god get an old-fashioned hold on god shaking and pulling the holy ghost does to you he's loosening up that dirt around you so you can put your roots down he said them experiences experiences of healing experiences of baptism the holy ghost experiences the gifts of the spirit just anchors you in christ [Applause] and the harder it blows the harder you can hold and you can look right into the winds of laodicea and say it's going to take a stronger win than this it's going to take something more than you got because you ain't got enough hallelujah let me tell you something right now if the devil would have had enough he'd have used all he had to keep ron spencer from being here this weekend but apparently he ain't got enough amen if the devil had enough he'd have kept you from being here but he didn't have enough hallelujah some of you need to look at devil and i'd say devil you don't have enough because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world you don't have enough i'm still here hallelujah amen depression has tried to destroy you anxiety and fear is trying to tear you down but he didn't have enough [Applause] family troubles trying to split you apart but he didn't have enough because if he had enough he'd bring enough i mean that's the way i look at it if a guy was going to try my arm he was going to try to stop another army it's going to try to be bigger than what the army is facing going to have enough to stop them right i mean that's logical thinking brother branham there and now them lapping hill with them lapping rocks on those hills and that little boy had been in a vision being raised from the dead so when he saw what was taking place he turned around and he saw where he was at he said you can line every devil up they don't have enough because this is the time for the phenomenal the miraculous this is time for the vision to be fulfilled or church of the living god this is time for the vision that is solved to be fulfilled of that bride marching in step on with christian soldiers and she started to rise up she started to rise up oh come on now this is where we're at we're not going down into death we're not going down to and make another denomination we're not going back down to creeds and domes but we're rising up we're rising up and we're going to rise up over every devil in hell he's under my feet he's under my fridge he's under my feet why because god put him there i'm gonna say this right now if the devil is not under your feet he's out of his place hallelujah that's where he belongs [Applause] hallelujah he said let the church squeak and moan if you want to moan tonight go ahead moan you want to say days of miracles or past suit yourself you're dead anyhow reading a quote well we're a church those were trees but look at them no bark was on them blistered all the bark done been burned off they couldn't pack the life up no more if them trees had bark on them they'd packed the life to live again but all the bark had been stripped off all the maiden rituals and so forth and all the bark was taking place but now nothing they could do but squeak and squawk when the winds blew but god sent his wind just the same [Applause] i want you to understand something you come here to try to stop a move of god you might as well get out of the way because of when god wants to sin this will and god wants to send the power of the holy ghost through a building there ain't nothing you can do to stop it [Music] he'll send his win just the same and this little bitty church coming up this little handful was having himself a big time while the rest of them was carrying on with their moaning and groaning he said that's what we need it's god's power in the church but see satan is trying to keep us looking at a day gone or a day in the future but the time is now when you realize the time is now satan can't stop it [Applause] you must see that the time is now you must realize and believe your time is now to receive what you've been asking for you might have been asking for a long time but the time is now you've been might been looking for your healing for a long time but the time is now you might be looking for deliverance from that that spirit of depression but the time is now [Music] blind bartimaeus sitting on the wayside begging and all of a sudden he hears noise a lot of people got to shout what in the world's going on what's happening he's sitting over there in his blind condition hey somebody tell me what's going on there's noise what is this man named jesus he's coming riding through people are throwing palm leaves they're shouting they're just oh and somebody next to him say i hate nothing it's some of fanatic calls himself a prophet they say he's opened the eyes of the blind he's raised the dead they say he's done those things i i don't believe it blind bartimaeus said who you say it was [Applause] you what'd you say he did he healed the eyes of a blind jesus have mercy on me jesus have mercy on me so you begin to realize it's been a many days of sitting blindness but today is my day [Applause] right now is my time jesus is passing by and i don't want to remain the same can you have that same you might be sitting in all kinds of conditions tonight but if you'll just realize he said he would be here he promised he would be here and i've told you he's healed cancer he's healed brain blades he's done all kinds of things he ain't it ain't just something we talk about it's something we have witnessed if you'll realize who's in the building tonight you wouldn't better sit yourself you wouldn't be able to stay there and say oh just another service it's just another time jesus jesus don't pass me by it's my turn hallelujah what's all the noise what's all going on it's the lamb coming by it's a god of mercy coming by it's a god of healing coming by it's a god of salvation coming by it's a god of miracles coming by somebody begin to say ah days and miracles are passed i didn't quite and born blind boarded mess down he said jesus [Applause] [Music] see the people that don't believe in miracles is those that ain't never witnessed miracles have you ever witnessed it in your life they ain't nobody in the world could ever talk you out of it if you witness god a god of miracles and enough theologians they ain't enough devils that can talk you out of it [Applause] god said you can receive it what are you going to do you just let him pass by thursday night he came by friday nights he'd come by saturday he comes by sunday and it's monday and he went by if god said if you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost then go get it if god says healing's for you get it god promised it he will not lie no matter what they say the days and miracles are passed just let it let that go the god's word we're taking not somebody else's [Music] [Applause] you know there was a giant in the land one day come out he was making threats and he was calling uh the israel lights a bunch of dirty names calling a bunch of chickens and everything else weaklings send me a man send me somebody to fight me 40 days he came out could you imagine 40 days of listening to this nonsense but on that 40th day one morning this father told his young son said hey david go down to the camp and see what's going on take some bread and take some things to your brothers and bring me back a report so david comes down there and he goes down to the camp and as he walks in and hears this challenge and he notices as the giant makes his challenge everybody runs back into their tent danny steven said it like this and i like it i'm gonna borrow it he said they ran into their tent to pull up their laptop see if they'd find a quote about it but david came down with experience [Applause] he doesn't met the god he doesn't met the god of elijah he don't met him for himself amen and he goes he goes there and he he hears this challenge and brother said what happened he said on that 40th day there happened to be a different set of ears in the camp somebody that hadn't been there the previous 39 days happened to be there on that 40th day and one time was enough one time was all david wanted to hear he said who's this uncircumcised philistine that wants to challenge the armies of the living god send me i'll go fight him i'll take his head off now can you imagine that for 39 days had got up and fixed his breakfast he had got up and put on his armor he had got up and shined his shoes he'd got up and put on every piece of equipment that he needed he had ate his eggs he'd ate his toast whatever he'd done probably 12 eggs and about 14 pieces of toast he'd done all of that but this on this 40th day i like this it was his last day [Music] it was his last day to get up and put his shoes on it was his last days to put his armor on it was his last days to buckle up his chest my his chest protectors and all put it it was his last time to slide that helmet over that big ugly head it was his last time to say let's go out and let's make our challenge it was his last day [Applause] because a young boy who had met the god of miracles knew he wasn't just a god of miracles years ago but he had experienced him for himself he had saw him in the line with he fought the line he'd saw him when he fought the bear and he said this giant will be just like those dead paul said uh saul said let me tell you let me let me put you some armor on no no david i haven't proved this this does nothing for me but hinder me i don't need your intellectual speeches i don't need your man-made protection i need the god of elijah [Applause] and he pulls it all off and he reaches down and he gets his little sling shot and he want i actually got to walk down that same valley and i picked me up five stones and i looked down and i grabbed me some good giant killers got them sitting on my desk there at church just in case a giant ever shows up amen i imagine him looking down in there i thought about that as i sat there and i picked those rocks what was there to kill the giant david did not have to manufacture he did not have to make it he was already in the land it was already laying there all he had to do was pick it up he said yep that'll kill a god yep that'll kill him he puts him in his bag and he goes and he takes his head off why because he said this is the day this day i'll take your head off [Applause] let me tell you in this valley there's rocks for your deliverance [Music] in this valley there's rocks for your deliverance for your healing for your joy for everything that you have need of is laying there why don't you pick it up and say this day i'm taking that giant's head off cause this is the day for the phenomenal this is the day for the miraculous this is the day for god to move on my behalf [Music] yes sir hallelujah i don't know about all that brother timothy we'll just hang on a minute hold on with me just for a minute we can see another jairus came to his day he had need of a healer gets down into a real tough spot his little baby's sick and about to die and he goes to meet jesus and he meets him and jesus says i'll go with you turn it around i thought this was very awesome he turns around and he's walking back with jairus and and then all of a sudden a servant comes from jairus house he says she's dead jesus said i'll

in the middle of some stupid things speaking of one of my boys he fell off climbed the tree fell off and went straight down for a t post and it would have skewered him right up but god somehow moved him just to the side god shows who he is god's a god of miracles read one from brother andrew adam frazier when he was younger developed a very high fever causing a severe seizure the doctors were thinking possible that brain damage but minutes after brother ron prayed before he got to the hospital the whole situation had changed he said number two my dad the stories are too great not to repeat in the fire through a coma one moment nothing has happened next moment awake doctors say no brain activity but prayer changed the situation instantly talking slowly coming back to normal from zero to a hundred percent little girl in south africa south carolina with club feet prayer was offered and she ran all over the tent doug hill at the end of one of our servants became a dead man in front of hundreds of witnesses our church began to pray as one unit brother ron called for his life in a matter of moments i saw a dead man come to life in front of our entire congregation my own transformation i was a preacher's kid who had done some ungodly things made a wreck out of my life so-called message people wrote me off didn't offer me grace though thought i was a lost cause but in an instant i had an experience with a prince of life and i've never been the same [Applause] hallelujah i've never been the same and hell now has to pay for what it talked me into hell has to pay for what it talked me into because i have seen what god has done in my life i refuse to disbelieve that any person is unsavable [Applause] there is nothing too hard for our god take that devil oh it's the church of the living god i have that same attitude there's no one unsavable there's no i there's no incurable disease [Applause] there's nothing impossible everything is possible [Applause] when it's revealed to you that it's your moment i don't care what's wrong with you what the odds are it might the odds may be worse than it was with david against the goliath but if it's revealed to you this is my moment david became fearless he said today i'm going to cut your head off that's our god by grace in that crucial moment when decisions needed to be made the same god that produced the grace in that day and dropped the seed of faith and that little boy that same god in this crucial moment can take a woman from a wheelchair a little a little girl out of a bad situation he said if it's revealed to you i don't care how long it takes [Applause] but you got to remember it's your moment it's your time as we look to bring this down the greatest miracle he said well there's a lot of miracles brother timothy the greatest miracle that god has ever performed is when he took a sinner like me and he made a christian out of me and you want to say the days of miracles are passed there's miracles all over this building [Applause] he said look you believe that god can save anybody well that's far more miracle than a man that was dead a man that's dead and trespasses in sin a man that's dead and had to believe or remain dead then after you're born again you become a son of god how much more ought you ought to believe for a lesser miracle divine healing so if you can believe the god that saved you we ought to believe in a god who heals us [Applause] the greatest miracle ever performed is when god can take something and bring it back to li itself again just as he can take you in that dead wretched condition and change you and mold you and clean you and put himself in there that is the greatest miracle and he wants to do that tonight well i ain't never had that experience well he's here it's your turn my turn mine me yeah yeah yeah you're your turn your turn maybe you've been a hog but you don't have to remain one maybe you've been in pig slop but you don't have to stay there maybe you've been in the world and you've been so filthy and so tore up you don't have to stay there maybe your mind has been so tore up by satan's thoughts and things and he so convinced you that this word isn't for you and this message ain't for you and you're about to walk away you don't have to stay there he's here to take that away from you i remember a situation in my own life told it a couple of times but just personal testimony of my daughter being adriana been in a terrible accident and she went on a rip stick acting you know we don't have snow down south so she was on this rip stick acting like she was snowboarding on asphalt and she goes down the wrong way and can't make a turn so she goes down a real long pathway down to an end and goes tumbling at the end of the asphalt and 30 feet we had measured she went flying through the air and flipping over and over and her head hits up against a steel pole and i'm there and i'm watching it all take place we was there to be with the young people at the state park and flipping some hamburgers and i'm just praying god be merciful be merciful be merciful what nothing i could do i couldn't stop it if i wanted to and there were some girls down there where she landed and they began to scream for us to come and i went down there and there she's laying her head up against that pole and it's swelling out and i rolled her onto her back as carefully as i could because i didn't know what broke bone she may have or things i didn't know she's just grown and got that rattle i'm just saying baby talk to me adriana daddy wants to hear you talk to me and i'm praying and in my mind i'm thinking about when brother branham was out fishing and he's out fishing and one of his friends gets bit by a snake and he just calmly reaches over there and begins to pray and and god immediately took the strength of that venom away and healed the man he said lord we're not out here doing anything wrong we're out here enjoying nature that's what we were doing i said the same prayers the lord we're not out here doing anything wrong we're out here enjoying nature and fellowship together with believers and this accident has happened i need you to come by my way and then she begins to finally speak and she said daddy i can't see you and she's trying to open her eyes and they're all crossed and i see her eyes crossed really bad and i just begin to pray lord god come on the scene and uncross her eyes and i watched as those eyes would come straight and she she says daddy i can't see you and i said lord you uncrossed her eyes will you give her back her sight and she says daddy i see you now but she couldn't remember nothing about what she had happened what it was why am i here why am i dirty why my feet are they cut off what's wrong she could feel pain but she just had no clue why she was in the position that she was in she had amnesia and so we'd called for an ambulance and it was about 20 minutes away because we was way out the state park on this lake and so they're rushing and there's another brother that was there he calls my dad and my dad's studying for sunday and he's he's uh uh he just picks up the phone hears the news puts it down says lord let there not be one broke bone a few minutes the ambulance finally gets there and and and we put her in and as we're putting her in her mind begins to spark back to her and she said oh i was doing this and i was doing this we were doing oh i i know now and you can see lights coming on we just begin to thank the lord for what we saw and rushed her to they wanted to take her on to the hospital and so they rushed to the hospital sister ruth got in there with her and some of the other brothers and sisters there took the rest of my kids and i got in a van to go meet my father in a little town and was going to get together and go to the hospital together and as i'm driving i'm just thanking the lord for all that i saw and the miracle that had taken place and i just got my hand up and my tear i didn't know how i was driving and i'm just praising god for what i saw and out of my mouth i hear something speak and i really begin to realize it's my voice and it says what you've seen in the natural you'll also see in the supernatural and now it's just like a gong hit me upside the head i'm like what was that and i'm and i just began to again thank god okay god i don't know what's about to happen but i just want to praise you for it we go to the hospital and they do cat scans and x-rays and cat scans and mris and x-rays and the doctor finally comes in and he says look he says i can he said we have done so many really a dangerous amount of scans he said but we were so sure that there were broke bones we were so sure that she had a concussion we were but there ain't a sign of a broke bone there's not even a sign of a concussion it's all gone he said he said we're gonna have to keep her overnight because she was observed knocked out just to observe her but there's really nothing to worry about he said it's all gone and so i was actually had been preparing for sunday night the next night it was on saturday the next night to preach at our communion service and i had been looking on a thought on a guardrail we could we rely on now i didn't need notes sunday morning brother tim preaches i leave and go pick up sister little adriana and my and my wife go pick her up we bring her back to the evening service she's there in the evening service and i began to tell the testimony and i said i don't know what's about to happen but i know god is moving and god's going to move in a very phenomenal way because he said what i've seen in the natural we're gonna see in the supernatural and i said what i saw in the natural was a girl going down the wrong way going down to a bitter end and the destruction on every hand but in just a moment god turned it all around and gave her back her mind took away every sign of it it's gone [Applause] even just a few days every scar that had been on her body was completely gone it was a miracle by that next wednesday i began to study on a thought on spiritual identity crisis because of what had happened and i come out to preach and there's a a man about my age maybe a month older than me a couple months older than me brother phillip and he had been out of church for seven years and he didn't got to the place he'd come to some of our family camps some of our youth camps but he'd got to the place he said it ain't for me it might be for my wife it might be for my kids it ain't for me i can't live it i i can't do it i've tried it's dumb done i'm finished but that week god began to deal on his heart and just a few minutes before they had went out of that house to go to church he said if you'll wait a minute i'll get ready and go with you [Applause] well listen this mama and these kids have been praying later he would testify he wondered why his his mattress was so lumpy he said because there was so many prayer cloths under it almost every meeting had come up for a prayer call we want our daddy back we want our daddy back we want our daddy back and then we're holding on i want my daddy back i want my daddy back and on this wednesday night daddy came back [Applause] and god moved in a miracle working way and totally changed his life forever [Applause] and i say that wasn't just for that wednesday night it's for this weekend as well [Applause] he's bringing somebody back from spiritual amnesia they lost herself they don't know who they are but they're on their way

say i just see a spirit creeping in amongst us where we just begin to be just comfortable and casual and you know what god has to do he has to allow circumstances listen we want god in our lives we the greatest miracle brother menno we had we had brother gift pass through here just a week ago wednesday and he just was a blessing to us but i woke up that morning i was so down in the dumps i was brother ed you were down in the dumps absolutely and then i was going to meet brother gift for breakfast we just started talking and he started fellowshipping on how god moved in his heart i started talking how and i'll tell you what as i started talking about it something started rising within me and all of a sudden it is not what the devil is portraying i am this and god has done this and he's done this and as brother timothy was talking about all the things that god has done i trust somewhere you said that's me in there somewhere there's a part of me in there and i just take take the part god made real to you condition your heart i i think it's in a message voice of god in this last day brother man would say condition us lord for there's a rapture coming one day and i just say lord condition us today all things are possible it's not what the devil said it's not the end of the story and and you can just say there is coming a last day for me there's coming a last day for this trial there is going to be a day when i'm and i and start moving towards it i don't know when it'll be start thanking for it say lord you're going to do it i don't know how i don't know where but i believe in you and you're going to take care of it let's move with him let's just take another step this is step one let's take another step i think we need to sing a song or two and and just move in that channel a little bit does that sound good i really appreciate our brother timothy god bless you thank you for laboring [Applause] [Music] i hate to say it but sometimes we need somebody to just labor and labor and not let go and god bless them for that how many say i needed that i needed that now let's just take another step let's just move a little higher lord let me rise on the wings of faith [Music] lord sometimes sometimes the way down [Music] on the wings [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but let me rise oh i see your face [Music] [Applause] the lord is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] let me ride on the wings of faith until the day i see your face [Music] [Music] but let me amen i shared this with your church on sunday brother kelly but we'd had a long day friday we had a wedding and saturday morning i got up and went out it was nice enough that i went out to a little area and just was burdening my heart before the lord and this situation and that situation and i just had finished praying and i'm sitting out there in the patio between the trees and i watched this bird coming across the sky and i could make out its features it was flapping and and i was it's crossing sort of from the west to the east and and all of a sudden before it goes behind the trees it sort of circles and i thought strange it's going back but it wasn't going back it started circling and it went up and it circled up once twice three times i started to lose the distinguishing features and and then all sudden it flew but at a higher level it was flying a little differently and i'll say this it that did something in my heart and i just said that's us lord we don't need to fight down here and slog it out we just need to allow you to take us a little higher and i believe god started a little take us a little higher today i believe that we need to allow ourselves to be in a position for a miracle to happen and you say lord you've let this you've let let let everything run out till there's only a little bit of oil and just a little bit of meal that's just the perfect place for god to come and so don't don't take what the devil says lord i don't know how you're going to do it but just start thanking him start allowing that let's let's sing a song we had a sister here sister tatusi i don't know if you remember sister emma but she sang a song god in your rivers you think are incrossable and she'd take the tambourine and she'd start singing that i think that was her signature song nobody could quite sing it like that but i think all of us together we could sing that and and put yourself in the equation here does that sound good let's just sing it brother michael lead us be of good courage [Music] any [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] god
