[31:06] welcome everybody to the end time
[31:09] message Tabernacle
[31:11] tonight you're here for the production
[31:12] of Dr law and Dr Grace
[31:15] we're excited that our young people have
[31:17] put this together for you and I hope you
[31:19] enjoy it I just have a couple things to
[31:21] lay out just before we get started I'd
[31:23] like to keep in mind that this is still
[31:25] a church not a theater so please let's
[31:28] keep our talking our no food or drink in
[31:32] this sanctuary if you need to eat or
[31:34] drink something please just exit out
[31:35] through the doors you came in at and
[31:38] the
[31:40] and then also no talking during the play
[31:43] if you can keep your cell phones turned
[31:44] off if you have a cell phone with you so
[31:46] that way it doesn't interrupt the
[31:48] production as well that would be greatly
[31:49] appreciated
[31:51] washrooms if you need to use the
[31:52] bathroom if you head out through these
[31:54] main doors here follow the arrows down
[31:56] down the stairs there's lots of
[31:59] washrooms at the bottom of the stairs
[32:01] there and then if you if you need the
[32:03] handicap bathroom it's just straight
[32:05] down the hallway on the right hand side
[32:06] there's a handicap washroom there
[32:09] um I will say also in case of an
[32:11] emergency please take note of the
[32:13] nearest exit nearest to you there's one
[32:15] there there's one straight through that
[32:16] curtain down there
[32:17] back out the way you came in
[32:19] and uh the muster point for this church
[32:22] is on the north side of the building so
[32:23] go that way
[32:25] that's North
[32:26] and we'll make sure you head out in that
[32:29] direction but I believe we won't have
[32:30] any cases of emergency like that
[32:33] I will tell you that the approximately
[32:35] the run time is about two hours long
[32:37] without intermission so
[32:39] sit back relax and enjoy it
[32:42] are we ready
[32:44] all right thank you so much with that
[32:47] let's start the play
[32:57] and so we were talking about how the Old
[32:59] Testament is a type of the law and in
[33:01] the law we were shown how
[33:04] that were Sinners and that were needed
[33:06] Salvation And how that our lives are not
[33:08] perfect no matter how we live them how
[33:11] we try to do what's right we try to do
[33:15] the best we can with what we know how
[33:16] that there's still a law that we've got
[33:18] to measure up to and with the law that
[33:20] means that there's a penalty otherwise
[33:21] the law has no value and to this law the
[33:27] penalty of this law is death and if you
[33:29] don't measure up with this law you're
[33:31] going to die and this death is the death
[33:35] of hell
[33:36] and when you
[33:38] and the only way for this death to be
[33:41] paid is for someone to come and take
[33:43] your place
[33:45] and in Romans chapter 7 Paul would say I
[33:49] find then a law that when I would do
[33:50] good evil is present with me
[33:53] and so this law just keeps overshadowing
[33:57] us that everywhere we go everything we
[33:58] would try to do it's always there to
[34:00] point us and say you need something more
[34:02] there's something greater there's
[34:03] something that's got to change
[34:07] and therefore
[34:09] to accept this salvation that you need
[34:12] so that you don't have to go into this
[34:14] death you need a heart change
[34:17] you need a heart that can be willing to
[34:20] accept what God has for you
[34:22] Ezekiel would just say I need a new
[34:25] heart will I give you and a new spirit
[34:27] will I put within you and I will take
[34:28] away the Stony heart out of your flesh
[34:30] and I will give you a heart of Flesh and
[34:33] I will put my spirit within you and I
[34:35] will cause you to walk in my statutes
[34:36] and you shall keep my judgments and you
[34:38] shall do them with this new heart there
[34:40] Comes This Promise of eternal life if
[34:42] you accept that Christ came on a cross
[34:45] and he died for your sins he died so
[34:47] that you didn't have to pay the penalty
[34:49] of death yourself so that you your life
[34:52] that you're living That Couldn't line up
[34:54] with the law now can but it's not
[34:57] because of you but it's because someone
[34:58] came and took your place
[35:01] and many will try to say that oh you
[35:04] just have to do good you just have to do
[35:05] this if you just do some of this you
[35:08] just do some of that if you just be a
[35:09] good person if you just believe if you
[35:11] just do all these different things
[35:12] you'll make it
[35:14] but Paul would say
[35:16] it's not of Works lest any man should
[35:18] boast if it's something I can do then I
[35:21] don't need a savior something I can do
[35:22] then I don't need a Healer if there's
[35:24] something I can do then I don't need
[35:26] someone to come and set my life free
[35:28] because I can do it of myself and at
[35:30] that point there's no purpose of God
[35:32] there's no purpose of having
[35:34] any sort of a Creator out there but
[35:37] because I can't do it on my own because
[35:39] I need something to come and change my
[35:42] life that's why I need a savior
[35:45] and maybe there's something in your
[35:47] heart tonight and there's a hole you're
[35:48] finding there's something wrong with
[35:50] your heart you start realizing my heart
[35:52] doesn't line up with this law there's
[35:53] something in my heart that isn't right I
[35:55] got this issue I got that issue I try to
[35:58] measure up to the law and I can't
[35:59] because there's I don't have the nature
[36:02] change that I need to be able to measure
[36:04] up to this lie don't have this gift that
[36:06] God promised us he promised us the gift
[36:08] of the Holy Ghost and I need this gift
[36:11] because there's something in me that
[36:13] won't let me live this life anymore and
[36:16] if you have that desire tonight that you
[36:18] want to meet Christ and let him come and
[36:20] change your heart
[36:21] this altar is open
[36:23] it's free it's a free gift all you have
[36:26] to do is just surrender there's nothing
[36:27] more to it you just gotta accept that he
[36:31] came on the cross and that he died for
[36:33] your sin and that he's there to take
[36:35] your place that you don't have to die
[36:41] pretty sure
[36:44] I I don't know what to do with myself
[36:46] anymore I
[36:48] there's this something that just keeps
[36:50] coming to me night after night
[36:52] something deep down in my heart I can't
[36:54] get away from it I try to drain it out
[36:57] with with the things the world personal
[37:00] amusements and and try to find
[37:02] satisfaction in all the different things
[37:04] with no satisfaction comes I go to work

[37:08] day and there's just no peace there's no
[37:11] rest in my life and

[46:52] just won't be nice these days if people
[46:54] were nice that's what we need and uh you
[46:58] know everyone's all roiled up about
[46:59] politics and economics and inflation
[47:01] deflation you know affiliation
[47:04] Association initiation constipation
[47:07] be good
[47:09] we've got a patient what I was trying to
[47:12] say is no one's good these days and
[47:14] people just need to be nice to each
[47:16] other and um that's the ticket you know

[47:22] know you can be all your worries will
[47:24] take care of themselves I'm sure not not
[47:26] so Hasty here
[47:28] um there's something to be said for
[47:29] being kind to your neighbor uh but it
[47:30] doesn't stop there okay uh there's like
[47:33] many many people that are poor the less
[47:35] fortunate on the streets all they have
[47:37] is the clothes on their back that's
[47:38] right think of those
[47:39] um think of the one how you could just
[47:42] help them a little bit better but you
[47:43] gotta shoot for those ones and you can't
[47:45] just be a talker be gonna be a walker
[47:47] you can't be a walker but you gotta be a
[47:49] talker you gotta talk to talk and walk
[47:50] the walk you gotta be a doer that's good
[47:52] I do try to do I I don't know when was
[47:55] the last time you passed by like uh one
[47:57] of those homeless fellows did you treat
[47:58] him like a human being did you give him
[48:00] a nod it's all about your attitude if
[48:02] you can do that I'm sure you'll make it
[48:05] I well I I do yeah it's that sort of
[48:08] thing right there like think about
[48:09] Charities hey
[48:11] um how much do you make in a year well
[48:12] uh thirty thousand yeah
[48:14] um so three thousand dollars goes to
[48:17] groceries twenty seven thousand goes to
[48:19] charity and that's it bare minimum 95
[48:22] bare minimum and uh
[48:24] the Golden Rule give on to others that's
[48:26] all you need to know the rest doesn't
[48:27] matter
[48:28] um you've just got to be a good person
[48:30] and everything will take care of itself
[48:32] and I'm sure you I'm sure it will all
[48:34] right facts right there you know the
[48:35] other day I volunteered at the local uh
[48:37] I was about a week ago I volunteered at
[48:39] the local animal shelter and uh just
[48:41] looking after all those poor animals you

[48:44] difference they made a difference on me

[48:47] there I almost got my toe bitten off but
[48:49] uh I'm not gonna even gonna say well I
[48:51] was being good though I was being good
[48:52] yeah but um it's the little things that
[48:55] count you know my heart just felt yes my
[48:58] heart my heart yes your heart exactly
[48:59] exactly your heart practice good works
[49:02] it'll make your heart feel better like
[49:04] you know what it's not it's not a bad
[49:05] thing to be goody two shoes it could be

[50:46] moment
[50:59] well then how can I help you
[51:03] well miss I've I've seen the doctors you
[51:06] referred to me I've seen doctor think so
[51:08] and hope so I I've seen the doctors they
[51:12] referred to me Dr do good and Dr be good
[51:14] but they're just hoping and thinking
[51:16] they're right they're they're doing good
[51:17] and it's good things but it just doesn't
[51:19] go deep enough for me it there's still
[51:21] something nagging it they're good
[51:24] thoughts they're they're kind they're
[51:25] helpful but it just it's something still
[51:27] aching in my heart something's still
[51:29] empty
[51:31] oh
[51:33] you seem to be a bit more of a complex
[51:37] case
[51:39] uh
[51:44] uh well if they didn't
[51:46] satisfy you then maybe you'd like Dr
[51:50] knowledge
[51:52] I can check if you like sure yeah
[51:57] it starts with the k
[52:08] there was a cancellation actually so I
[52:11] can squeeze you in today
[52:13] um
[52:15] um but his treatments they they do take
[52:17] a little bit more time and effort I'll
[52:20] see whoever you tell me see I I want to
[52:23] fill this void in my heart I I I'm not
[52:26] your average client
[52:28] well
[52:32] here's your referral and just down the
[52:35] hall again well thank you
[52:54] um Dr knowledge
[52:57] oh
[52:58] hey young man how are you doing please
[53:00] please take a seat take a seat relax
[53:03] sit down tell me
[53:05] why did you come into my office oh well
[53:09] where do I begin
[53:11] doctor I I have an empty feeling and in
[53:15] my heart
[53:17] trouble with the cares of this life
[53:19] seen many other doctors but none of them
[53:22] seem to have the answer
[53:23] is there anything you can do to help me
[53:26] hmm ah I see I see right right very very
[53:32] fascinating
[53:33] very fascinating you're a very
[53:36] fascinating case seems to me that you
[53:39] seem to be suffering from some sort of
[53:41] degree of mental disorder yes or deep
[53:45] emotional distress have you considered a
[53:48] self-improvement program Tommy Robinson
[53:50] has the top program in the country yes
[53:54] that's the ticket it most definitely
[53:56] will help you
[53:58] well I I guess I could deserve a
[54:00] pamphlet or something you can give me on
[54:01] it right here young man
[54:06] well I I guess I've heard of it but I I
[54:10] doctor I I don't think I think this will
[54:13] still go go deeper than this I no doubt
[54:16] it would help me it would it would it
[54:18] would do good things just maybe touch
[54:20] the surface but
[54:22] I'm just not sure if this is the answer
[54:24] it it's a good program but I just don't
[54:26] think it'll go deep enough to to make a
[54:28] difference that would count to satisfy
[54:30] the longing in my heart
[54:33] hmm
[54:34] well
[54:36] if that's not good enough for you
[54:37] perhaps we should set you up with a
[54:40] therapist I do indeed think that you
[54:43] need help yes a therapist can sit down
[54:46] with you yes and discuss all your
[54:48] troubles in life he will get that head
[54:50] on straight and iron out all those hard
[54:53] tough feelings bothering you
[54:56] doctor I I'm sorry I
[55:00] I'm not I'm having a hard time
[55:02] understanding how how sitting down and
[55:05] talking with someone would make a
[55:07] difference said I I don't think that
[55:09] would be the best answer right you know
[55:11] no doubt it would help some people and
[55:13] it does help people it would make me
[55:15] feel good for sure but I just don't
[55:17] think we'll get to the root of the
[55:19] problem I I don't think this is
[55:21] something a therapist will help me with
[55:24] huh
[55:26] huh
[55:27] I see I see hmm this seems to be a very
[55:31] more serious case than I thought oh my
[55:34] oh my I have to make a very strong
[55:37] recommendation and I believe that you
[55:39] you need a psychiatrist yes a
[55:42] psychiatrist now I can assure you that
[55:45] with proper therapy and uh a follow-up
[55:49] that when our top team of professionals
[55:52] that we can get that get you settled and
[55:55] fix where you stand yes I hundred
[55:57] percent guarantee that will fix you a
[56:00] psychiatrist doctor we just talked about
[56:02] a therapist and
[56:03] I don't this isn't a mental health issue
[56:06] doctor I it's something with my heart
[56:08] it's deep down in my heart and
[56:10] I need something else other than a
[56:12] psychiatrist it's just it's not going to
[56:14] work is there anything else that you can
[56:16] do for me
[56:17] um
[56:18] look
[56:19] all right Captain good faith let you
[56:22] leave without giving you my top
[56:23] recommendation yes yes why don't we
[56:26] consider a trial of antidepressants yes
[56:29] that'll work or some anxiety medication
[56:33] yes that will work we can start the
[56:36] medication well now just a small dose
[56:39] you know take things slow easy and
[56:42] having regular follow-up yes and then we
[56:45] can dial you in yes and we will think
[56:48] about putting you on maybe a bigger dose
[56:50] over time yes we'll do that until those
[56:53] little feelings that are bothering you
[56:55] are just go numb and everything will be
[56:57] all right yes you'll finally be able to
[57:01] live your life day to day without
[57:04] feeling any anxiety yes or at least keep
[57:07] it manageable we'll have we can work at
[57:11] how taking this care of starting well
[57:13] tomorrow actually trust me I have a
[57:17] strong background in this I know
[57:20] obviously what I'm talking about and
[57:23] you're not my first patient nor will you
[57:26] be the last medication is always the
[57:29] answer
[57:30] doctor I
[57:32] I'm sorry I I just don't think this is
[57:35] for me I thanks I I'm sure I
[57:38] I'm sure this is the right hand I no
[57:40] doubt I mean this would help some people
[57:42] you know it does good it it helps people
[57:45] but this is something deeper than just
[57:48] anxiety or conscience or or taking
[57:50] taking this pill it's not going to
[57:52] change who I am
[57:54] who I've seen who I am as a person that
[57:57] my nature it's not going to change it
[57:59] there's there's a nature to to lie to
[58:02] lust to to do the things I know aren't
[58:04] right
[58:05] you know I well I've heard it said that
[58:08] if you love the world or the things of
[58:10] the world then the love of God isn't
[58:12] even in you

[1:02:24] problem with my heart

[1:02:28] cares of this life
[1:02:30] I'm trying to get my heart right I I've
[1:02:31] seen the other doctors but they just
[1:02:33] haven't been able to give me an answer
[1:02:35] you know looking at from your medical
[1:02:37] abstract that we just looked at we know
[1:02:39] exactly what's wrong with you really
[1:02:41] yeah
[1:02:44] my friend
[1:02:50] my friend

[1:03:15] do is show it
[1:03:17] simple simple equation there and uh keep
[1:03:20] regular attendance you know if you start
[1:03:21] missing a service or two you might get
[1:03:23] that
[1:03:24] certain look and they might start
[1:03:26] worrying about you a little bit you know
[1:03:28] your condition might be backsliding we
[1:03:29] don't need that also don't forget to pay
[1:03:31] your clinical ties and offering
[1:03:33] that's admissions that's vital for the
[1:03:36] clinic co-work and for you don't forget
[1:03:38] that and uh our documents say if you
[1:03:41] bless the clinic the windows of heaven
[1:03:43] will pour a blessing ten times back upon
[1:03:45] you
[1:03:46] you know consider it an investment in
[1:03:49] yourself you need to give we can tell
[1:03:51] you're not giving enough you need to
[1:03:53] give and give and give of yourself till
[1:03:55] it hurts because that hurt will feel the
[1:03:57] hurt it will fill that hurt that's in
[1:04:00] your soul right now and you'll be a new

[1:04:19] your hand and to to do that for you
[1:04:21] you're
[1:04:22] you got to take on the responsibility
[1:04:24] that you're in
[1:04:26] you know that's probably the main cause
[1:04:29] of the hole in your heart I think so you
[1:04:31] need to give more thanks like just just

[1:05:39] feel it's not enough I
[1:05:42] everyone's giving me the answer it seems
[1:05:44] like they're giving me the same answers
[1:05:46] and
[1:05:47] I leave with the original problem
[1:05:48] regardless of what they tell me
[1:05:52] I don't I have this hole in it in my
[1:05:54] heart and I don't want to cover it up
[1:05:56] fill it or bundle it up
[1:05:58] it's my life I and if it is my heart
[1:06:02] I can't risk I can't risk my my life I
[1:06:05] have one life and it
[1:06:09] I would die if I lost my heart
[1:06:12] I can't risk it I you all seem to be
[1:06:14] saying the same thing
[1:06:16] is there not just another doctor you can
[1:06:18] refer me to what another doctor you're
[1:06:21] joking right no I did you not see the
[1:06:24] priest raise his hands nod his head
[1:06:28] well yeah I I did but
[1:06:32] if you want to accept our ancient Creeds
[1:06:34] then you're lost you're hopeless there's
[1:06:36] nothing we can do for you like it's that
[1:06:38] plane if you want to accept it there's
[1:06:40] nothing we can do for you like I'm sorry
[1:06:42] and as for other doctors there's the
[1:06:45] old-fashioned doctor
[1:06:47] Inspirations I shouldn't have said his
[1:06:48] name Dr love you know he said the same
[1:06:51] things from the since the beginning of
[1:06:52] time he hasn't kept up with our modern
[1:06:54] medicine like
[1:06:56] his practices you wouldn't even want to
[1:06:58] go near them like
[1:07:00] and like he wanted to bulldoze our
[1:07:04] beautiful Mega clinics people gave of
[1:07:07] themselves in order to receive a
[1:07:09] blessing he wants to bulldoze people's
[1:07:11] blessings hey you want to go to him
[1:07:14] he even called the thieves and
[1:07:15] hypocrites
[1:07:16] he has no place in this organization
[1:07:19] if you want to go to him then I'm sorry
[1:07:21] you won't take our expert advice you're
[1:07:24] lost
[1:07:27] what am I going to do
[1:07:29] is Dr live and still around I haven't
[1:07:31] seen him since we kicked him out of our
[1:07:33] denomination years ago I just saw him
[1:07:34] the other day he said something about
[1:07:36] Jezebel's painted face
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:08:08] Excuse Me Miss I
[1:08:12] you know I've I've been to see these
[1:08:14] other doctors
[1:08:15] I still don't have an answer to this
[1:08:17] problem I've been searching for there
[1:08:19] has to be more I need help
[1:08:21] The more I've I've looked the worse it's
[1:08:23] gotten
[1:08:26] I'm very sorry to hear that you seem to
[1:08:30] be having
[1:08:31] no luck with any of our doctors which is
[1:08:35] very unusual most people are quite happy
[1:08:37] with the common answers
[1:08:44] is there anyone else I can see that the
[1:08:47] doctors of religion they they mention
[1:08:49] another doctor
[1:08:51] his name was Dr law
[1:08:54] doctor law
[1:08:57] that's been a very long time since I
[1:09:00] heard that name Dr Lop

[1:09:15] I'm good it's good to see you I
[1:09:19] I don't know I am I haven't been able to
[1:09:21] find any help yet none of the doctors
[1:09:23] have had the answer I I'm looking for
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:27] the secretary is trying to get me
[1:09:28] appointment with Dr law
[1:09:31] yeah we all have to measure up with the
[1:09:35] law at some point everybody has a
[1:09:37] meeting with him
[1:09:38] just have to accept it
[1:09:43] um
[1:09:44] you already have an appointment with Dr
[1:09:47] law
[1:09:49] for this day and
[1:09:53] this hour
[1:09:55] before the foundation of the world

[1:10:01] I'm stunned I
[1:10:02] but I'm glad you're here for such a time
[1:10:04] as this
[1:10:06] I'm here to be with you and help you
[1:10:08] pray
[1:10:11] Dr law is the best at what he does
[1:10:15] there is no trouble he can't diagnose
[1:10:22] there's no question he doesn't have the
[1:10:24] answer for
[1:10:26] but his sayings are hard
[1:10:29] and few can bear to hear them
[1:10:35] I guess I'll go see him where is he
[1:10:43] thank you
[1:10:55] foreign

[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:11] I've tried to
[1:12:15] repent but
[1:12:18] I can't see
[1:12:23] the angel
[1:12:24] Satan is used
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:53] Lord I know that
[1:12:56] there's a day

[1:13:41] say turn again
[1:13:49] don't let me grow
[1:13:52] over
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:56] over
[1:13:58] God's mercy on
[1:14:04] don't let yours
[1:14:11] speak the last time
[1:14:15] I prayed and you've gone
[1:14:22] the storm is in my mind
[1:14:29] don't let me cross
[1:14:33] over
[1:14:36] over
[1:14:37] God's mercy alive

[1:14:45] don't let me cross
[1:14:50] over over

[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:45] Excuse me yes Dr law yes
[1:15:51] come on in so nice to see you

[1:15:56] you you folded there and who's this
[1:15:58] young man this Minister nice to meet you
[1:16:01] minister
[1:16:02] yeah so we've been expecting you we
[1:16:04] don't really have many people come to
[1:16:06] see me
[1:16:07] but I'm sure glad to see it
[1:16:11] what's bothering you
[1:16:13] no doctor
[1:16:16] I know my life isn't right
[1:16:18] it's been hitting me up inside of all
[1:16:21] right I've been to see other medical
[1:16:23] doctors at this clinic and none of them
[1:16:25] have the answer that I'm looking for
[1:16:26] there's still something negging at me in
[1:16:29] my heart
[1:16:31] my Minister has told me that everyone
[1:16:34] has an appointment with Dr law at some
[1:16:36] point
[1:16:37] well I'm glad that could be under these
[1:16:40] circumstances instead of when
[1:16:42] everything's going wrong
[1:16:44] is there anything you can do to help me
[1:16:46] certainly
[1:16:48] certainly
[1:16:50] we can take a look we folder and uh
[1:16:53] see what a record says why don't you
[1:16:55] take a seat
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:58] I'll be praying for you for you Dr
[1:17:00] London
[1:17:05] Maurice
[1:17:09] let's go over your folder here and
[1:17:14] so tell me
[1:17:18] how has your hearing been
[1:17:20] well I
[1:17:23] I guess I I could say that I I do think
[1:17:25] it's been all right I hmm I do it enjoy
[1:17:29] listening to some some good clean
[1:17:30] wholesome Christian music
[1:17:33] you know clean lyrics
[1:17:36] I hope that that's that's what that's
[1:17:39] what I even listening to yeah hmm
[1:17:41] okay
[1:17:43] sure let's take a look
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:50] see loads of Filth in here
[1:17:53] really low to filter in here my goodness
[1:17:59] see
[1:18:01] Dolores can be clean and
[1:18:04] as good as you want them to be but
[1:18:07] the question is
[1:18:09] what is the spirit
[1:18:11] and the attitude
[1:18:13] behind what you listen
[1:18:16] see we're living on age where
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:20] you need discernment
[1:18:22] and all right from wrong
[1:18:26] now I don't know about
[1:18:28] I feel like you're suffering from a very
[1:18:31] severe case of each and years
[1:18:36] yes each and years
[1:18:38] I'm afraid that you have
[1:18:42] you have damage years
[1:18:46] I'm freely you've done so but anyways
[1:18:50] how has your vision been
[1:18:52] wow I guess I better tell the truth
[1:18:57] try not to watch bad things but
[1:19:00] you know
[1:19:01] you struggle with some shows television
[1:19:04] shows some movies
[1:19:05] worries you know you can be watching
[1:19:08] something good but the next thing you
[1:19:10] know something pops up and you're you're
[1:19:12] watching something that isn't edifying
[1:19:14] it doesn't help you you know it
[1:19:18] and there's dark moments when when
[1:19:21] you're ensnared with lustful images with
[1:19:24] things that you know
[1:19:27] shouldn't be looking at Grace you know
[1:19:29] what I I say
[1:19:31] how can you overcome how can you
[1:19:34] get away from these things if it's right
[1:19:37] at your fingertips all the time
[1:19:39] that's a good question
[1:19:41] that's a very good question
[1:19:44] anyways
[1:19:46] let's take a look
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:19:52] he always discard
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] badly scared
[1:19:57] hmm
[1:19:59] seemed to be softened from
[1:20:02] very bad
[1:20:03] case of the Lost of the oil
[1:20:07] it's very interesting tell me how
[1:20:10] many are people that come to see me well
[1:20:12] not many people as we said few come to
[1:20:15] see me
[1:20:17] but it's very interesting hey you know
[1:20:19] almost the ones that come have the very
[1:20:22] same issue
[1:20:23] the lust of the oil
[1:20:26] you know the scriptures don't say that
[1:20:30] the oil is to get to your soul
[1:20:35] you know what the things that you've
[1:20:36] been watching has been affecting your
[1:20:38] soul even though
[1:20:39] it does look like it's not really
[1:20:41] affecting your soul
[1:20:43] But as time goes on
[1:20:45] eventually start to realize that yes
[1:20:48] something has happened and
[1:20:51] I'm not the same
[1:20:55] the scripture does also said that if you
[1:20:56] look at the woman to load stuff to her
[1:20:59] you have committed adultery in your
[1:21:01] heart
[1:21:04] no doubt you've done that
[1:21:08] based on that well surely
[1:21:11] you're perishing you're on your way to
[1:21:12] death
[1:21:14] of course the scripture does say that
[1:21:17] thou shall not commit adultery
[1:21:19] and the adulterers will not enter into
[1:21:21] the kingdom of heaven
[1:21:25] I'm very afraid that the times you've
[1:21:28] looked that have caused you to
[1:21:32] to destroy your heart and have a
[1:21:33] darkness and blackness in there
[1:21:37] as a matter of fact
[1:21:41] I think you're only aware
[1:21:43] to that
[1:21:46] unfortunately
[1:21:47] but anyways let me carry on here
[1:21:51] tell me how has your tongue been
[1:21:53] yeah
[1:21:55] you know
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:21:59] well it's easy to just say a little
[1:22:01] white lie
[1:22:03] you know you're sitting quietly yeah
[1:22:07] a little bit of a half truth
[1:22:11] okay
[1:22:13] you know you're you're sitting with
[1:22:15] friends you're cutting up you're
[1:22:17] laughing and the next thing you know
[1:22:19] you've tore that someone's character
[1:22:21] down by saying something rude saying
[1:22:24] cussing swearing at them hmm
[1:22:26] you know
[1:22:28] I believe
[1:22:31] in times
[1:22:33] even in traffic where you cut someone
[1:22:34] off and they cut you off
[1:22:37] well you call that man a fool fool
[1:22:39] probably worse worse
[1:22:42] really
[1:22:44] you keep speed limits
[1:22:50] we're all doctor
[1:22:51] you're the law so you you must know I
[1:22:53] don't hmm
[1:22:55] I guess obviously
[1:23:01] well I know less
[1:23:02] let's take a look at your tongue pull a
[1:23:04] date here
[1:23:08] um see
[1:23:11] I'm afraid that you
[1:23:14] on Bridal tongue
[1:23:17] has poisoned you completely
[1:23:23] and you end this as I told you
[1:23:26] that
[1:23:29] but anyway so I want to take a look at
[1:23:31] your reflex here
[1:23:33] just put your feet just kind of you know
[1:23:34] rectangle there for me
[1:23:37] well thank you very much I got nice
[1:23:38] pants here nice
[1:23:42] well this might be a little person okay
[1:23:45] all right
[1:23:49] how dare you do that to me you shouldn't
[1:23:51] do that to me how do I give you some of
[1:23:54] that back
[1:23:55] no come there come on WOW
[1:24:01] you've had a very bad case of temper
[1:24:12] Don't You Know The Temper breathes loads
[1:24:14] of sicknesses
[1:24:16] and diseases
[1:24:19] you know it's easy to last say to people
[1:24:20] very easy
[1:24:23] you know someone step on your toe
[1:24:25] go back
[1:24:27] tell them all you have to tell them
[1:24:31] that's all you may say well that's right
[1:24:33] that's that's the way it approaches
[1:24:35] but we live in an age that's
[1:24:38] an age of broadly kindness
[1:24:42] there's an age where I was supposed to
[1:24:44] love one another supposed to be kind to
[1:24:46] one another
[1:24:47] not to have temper and
[1:24:49] the last shade for every issue one
[1:24:52] try to get back to someone or
[1:24:55] try to make things equal and do all that
[1:24:58] that's not what we've been called to do
[1:25:01] but for sure
[1:25:03] I can notice that you
[1:25:05] quite a case
[1:25:07] your temper is very bad
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:13] well up until now we haven't seen
[1:25:16] anything positive son
[1:25:19] all I can see is
[1:25:21] your mistakes and your faults
[1:25:24] by the way
[1:25:25] what do you do during the weekends oh
[1:25:28] doctor first I'm sorry I
[1:25:31] I didn't mean to lash out to you oh it's
[1:25:33] okay it's okay everyone who comes here
[1:25:34] does it it's all right I'm used to what
[1:25:39] do you do the weekend
[1:25:40] well on the weekend day
[1:25:43] probably go places I shouldn't go hmm
[1:25:46] take this
[1:25:48] a walk
[1:25:50] Where Angels Fear to walk hmm
[1:25:53] you know go places where no man made in
[1:25:56] the likeness of God should go
[1:25:59] now I go to movie theaters clubs
[1:26:02] to bars concerts hmm
[1:26:09] right
[1:26:10] so what do you do last Friday
[1:26:12] well probably went out and
[1:26:15] got a little bit under the influence
[1:26:18] tell me what influence
[1:26:20] probably got a little drunk and drunk
[1:26:23] woke up didn't know where I was
[1:26:26] crooked part syndrome
[1:26:30] crooked passenger
[1:26:36] half
[1:26:38] see
[1:26:42] we live in the world you can go wherever
[1:26:43] you want to go
[1:26:45] itself is not really sin
[1:26:48] for you to go where you want to go
[1:26:51] but actually where you go is reflection
[1:26:55] of what is on the inside of you
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:01] and as I said your heart has got
[1:27:02] troubles and darkness in there and
[1:27:05] obviously that's why you've been
[1:27:08] you've been led to these kind of places
[1:27:14] all I can see is just
[1:27:17] that
[1:27:19] that
[1:27:21] anyways let me perform my law my last
[1:27:24] test here
[1:27:26] before you
[1:27:28] before we move on to draw a conclusion
[1:27:31] I'm gonna check and hear your heartbeat
[1:27:34] okay
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:43] breathe in okay
[1:27:47] well
[1:27:52] that clearly confirms
[1:27:56] are everything that's what you've said
[1:28:01] um
[1:28:03] see all your symptoms are
[1:28:05] pointing to one root cause
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:14] doctor you have a broken heart
[1:28:17] doctor said there is a peace missing in
[1:28:21] your heart
[1:28:23] see
[1:28:25] this wrong
[1:28:27] is a long
[1:28:29] Ronin bloodline defect
[1:28:32] the goal is all the way down to the
[1:28:34] first man and the first woman
[1:28:37] and this of course your hearts to be
[1:28:39] wounded
[1:28:43] what do I what do I do I
[1:28:46] you know some people can do something
[1:28:47] about it
[1:28:49] but not everyone can
[1:28:50] [Music]
[1:28:53] Dr I I don't know what you mean by
[1:28:55] bloodline defect you're telling me
[1:28:58] there's a missing piece in my heart
[1:29:01] yes
[1:29:03] um
[1:29:04] see
[1:29:06] I'm sorry boss
[1:29:08] it doesn't matter how good you are
[1:29:10] it doesn't matter whether your big man
[1:29:12] your small mind it doesn't matter you're
[1:29:14] rich you're poor I I do I try to do good
[1:29:17] things I
[1:29:18] that is not the issue
[1:29:23] see everyone is born with this problem
[1:29:26] in the heart
[1:29:29] everyone is Born This Way
[1:29:31] as we told you it goes all the way back
[1:29:33] then to your ancient ancestors
[1:29:37] see because of the failure
[1:29:41] rights at the beginning
[1:29:45] you are a condemned Ma
[1:29:48] in other words you sit on that right
[1:29:51] name
[1:29:52] you are a past house
[1:29:54] of corruption
[1:29:59] all the symptoms
[1:30:02] as you could see from your reaction
[1:30:05] does clearly tell
[1:30:07] that the only aware
[1:30:10] to die
[1:30:12] okay
[1:30:14] but doctor I
[1:30:16] I can't accept I can't accept that I I'm
[1:30:19] good for nothing here's your trifold
[1:30:22] your medical abstract take a look at it
[1:30:27] see right in there
[1:30:29] it's written average and you did wrong
[1:30:32] since you're throwing or your age of
[1:30:34] accountability
[1:30:36] everything you did wrong all the lies
[1:30:38] you told
[1:30:40] all the times that you look to the woman
[1:30:42] in the wrong way
[1:30:44] all the time is told
[1:30:47] everything you did wrong well there are
[1:30:49] some gotens in there too for sure but
[1:30:51] you see the good times do not change the
[1:30:55] fact that
[1:30:58] you have a piece missing in your heart
[1:31:00] doctor I you're telling me there's no
[1:31:03] hope or Escape
[1:31:04] that there's nothing I can do to get rid
[1:31:06] of this I've tried everything there's no
[1:31:10] hope
[1:31:11] I know you've tried everything
[1:31:12] as a matter of fact you know the the
[1:31:14] people that have been you know
[1:31:17] conducting studies for thousands of
[1:31:19] years is almost more than two thousand
[1:31:21] years now the David conducting stories
[1:31:23] trying to find a solution
[1:31:25] a solution to to fill this void
[1:31:29] in the heart of man
[1:31:33] some try to use Medical
[1:31:36] ways
[1:31:37] some try to tell you just be good
[1:31:40] some try to tell you you know
[1:31:43] if you think you're good you know some
[1:31:45] say religion is the answer and they've
[1:31:47] got some points in there but you see
[1:31:53] the problem here is that
[1:31:59] all the stories they've conducted
[1:32:01] they've all come to an end
[1:32:04] doctor
[1:32:07] there's nothing else see the only way
[1:32:09] the only way
[1:32:11] the only way that you are going to be
[1:32:13] able to save your heart from the moment
[1:32:16] of your birth
[1:32:17] was for you
[1:32:19] to follow every letter in this book
[1:32:24] without making even one mistake
[1:32:27] literally every letter
[1:32:29] not one mistake
[1:32:31] but you see
[1:32:33] right when you wake up when you're bad
[1:32:35] from bed in the morning you've already
[1:32:37] broken about 10 of them
[1:32:39] so
[1:32:42] what there's not much there's nothing
[1:32:44] else but a death sentence is is there
[1:32:47] not no one else nothing
[1:32:48] see
[1:32:50] in my job
[1:32:53] as I told you very few people come here
[1:32:54] and I was surprised to see you
[1:32:58] but see in my career all I have done is
[1:33:00] to just issue
[1:33:02] death sentences
[1:33:04] and
[1:33:06] um
[1:33:07] I'm sorry
[1:33:10] but I think to that
[1:33:13] you just received your death sentence
[1:33:16] well I'm sorry
[1:33:19] there's no one else you know of
[1:33:22] nothing else you can experienced her
[1:33:32] let me tell you a story
[1:33:38] there's a colleague of mine
[1:33:42] we went to school together
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:49] you know we used to call him
[1:33:51] the man that can turn on the light
[1:33:56] it's very fascinating told me when we
[1:33:58] went to school
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:00] we'll have an assignment and
[1:34:03] we'll spend hours sometimes to spend
[1:34:05] days
[1:34:06] and days trying to solve a problem
[1:34:13] I will sit there we'll try everything we
[1:34:15] can and we just can't seem to solve it
[1:34:18] but then he'll just walk in
[1:34:21] and when he walks in
[1:34:25] and in a question of moments seconds
[1:34:29] he just finds the solution and solves
[1:34:31] the problem
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:35] we all graduated from the Old Testament
[1:34:37] School of Law
[1:34:40] but after graduation he
[1:34:42] he decided to further his education
[1:34:46] so he made his way
[1:34:48] to calvary's mainton Academy
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:52] and there he obtained a degree
[1:34:56] a degree for
[1:34:58] every hard case
[1:35:01] you know cases that come to me thus
[1:35:04] you know I draw a conclusion and say it
[1:35:06] is impossible
[1:35:08] he says it is possible
[1:35:11] cases that come to me that have
[1:35:13] absolutely no hope like your case
[1:35:16] he says there is hope
[1:35:18] and there's freedom
[1:35:21] cases that come to me that literally
[1:35:23] their cases of debt
[1:35:25] you need to go to the graveyard and be
[1:35:27] buried right away
[1:35:29] but he says
[1:35:31] there is life
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:36] he's a very special man doctorate
[1:35:39] who is this man
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:43] I'll never forget his name
[1:35:49] Dr Grace can you tell me where to find
[1:35:52] Grace
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:55] see
[1:35:58] you don't need to find Grace

[1:40:59] I don't understand how it where are they
[1:41:03] when I look at that chart
[1:41:06] I see only one problem
[1:41:09] your broken heart
[1:41:13] everything else
[1:41:15] it's just a symptom of it
[1:41:18] carried on down through the blood
[1:41:23] corrupted
[1:41:26] that's why you need a new life
[1:41:28] a new nature a new heart
[1:41:31] you must be born again
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:36] doctorate
[1:41:39] what about these other problems
[1:41:43] I know that
[1:41:44] those other things that are bothering
[1:41:46] you
[1:41:47] they seem like
[1:41:49] great mountains challenges in your way
[1:41:55] but don't worry
[1:41:57] we look after your heart all those other
[1:42:00] things
[1:42:02] we'll take care of them as we need to
[1:42:06] well doctor what must I do
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:12] like I said before you need a new heart
[1:42:15] you're going to need an operation
[1:42:18] I know you've been to see all those
[1:42:20] other doctors
[1:42:22] looking for an answer
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:24] good things to say
[1:42:27] but
[1:42:28] when it comes to this operation
[1:42:31] there's some work that we got to do to
[1:42:32] get you ready
[1:42:34] well what what does this work what what
[1:42:37] are you gonna do
[1:42:39] what I have here for you
[1:42:41] is the prescription the answers that
[1:42:43] you're going to need
[1:42:45] the God's bills
[1:42:47] you need to take them every day
[1:42:51] and you'll find that
[1:42:54] it's going to start to make change in
[1:42:56] your life
[1:42:59] in the morning in the evening when you
[1:43:02] have a moment
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:05] study
[1:43:07] take them a little bit at a time
[1:43:12] simple truths
[1:43:14] but be careful
[1:43:17] if you go too long without taking them
[1:43:21] you're going to find that
[1:43:23] your heart might start to harden up
[1:43:25] you'll get a little bit less sensitive
[1:43:27] to the things that matter
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:32] what's in them I
[1:43:35] I just
[1:43:38] take a look
[1:43:40] and read through that medical literature
[1:43:44] you're going to need to study it
[1:43:45] meditate it'll teach you how to walk
[1:43:48] upright
[1:43:49] how to look after that new heart once
[1:43:52] you get it
[1:43:53] we don't want to give someone a heart
[1:43:56] who's going to treat it irresponsibly
[1:43:59] but I don't want you to worry if you
[1:44:00] find that you're struggling you're
[1:44:03] welcome
[1:44:04] to call on me at any time I'll always
[1:44:06] answer
[1:44:07] now
[1:44:09] I might make you work for it
[1:44:11] can't just give you everything
[1:44:14] without making sure that you are ready
[1:44:15] for it but I promise you Ethan if you
[1:44:18] seek
[1:44:19] you will find Doctor this this looks
[1:44:22] complicated it there's verses that
[1:44:26] they just seem to
[1:44:28] don't make sense
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:31] if you find you lack wisdom again just
[1:44:34] ask
[1:44:36] I'll never upgrade you for searching out
[1:44:38] the things of Truth and life
[1:44:42] and if you ask I will give you
[1:44:45] assistance liberally
[1:44:47] well I
[1:44:49] I guess I can do that again
[1:44:52] now
[1:44:53] study alone is not going to be enough
[1:44:56] you're going to need to exercise those
[1:44:59] things that you've learned to practice
[1:45:01] what you preach
[1:45:05] you're going to have to have faith that
[1:45:07] the treatment is going to work
[1:45:09] and you're going to have to trust in me
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] that the prescription
[1:45:15] is going to bring you
[1:45:16] what you need
[1:45:19] it's going to get hard
[1:45:21] once you start taking those God's pills
[1:45:23] and things start to change I know it's
[1:45:26] going to get hard
[1:45:28] so
[1:45:30] you'll be there for me to help me and
[1:45:35] I will I appreciate that
[1:45:42] there's some warnings that I have to
[1:45:44] give
[1:45:45] well it can be very serious warnings
[1:45:48] what are These Warnings that
[1:45:54] the god spills have some very strong
[1:45:56] drug drug interactions now you've been
[1:45:59] to see all those other doctors out there
[1:46:02] they have good things to say
[1:46:04] many people come to them with needs
[1:46:08] and they have answers some of them are
[1:46:10] very good answers
[1:46:13] but they don't tend to mix very well
[1:46:15] with the old-fashioned God spills
[1:46:20] one of the things that you'll find is if
[1:46:22] you try to
[1:46:24] mix the things of the world
[1:46:26] with the things that are in this book
[1:46:30] it's going to cause conflict
[1:46:32] you won't find answers you only find
[1:46:34] more questions
[1:46:39] picture log
[1:46:42] in the middle of the desert don't ask me
[1:46:44] how I got there
[1:46:48] without Old Log is it sits there
[1:46:51] dry arid Wasteland
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:56] that log could sit for hundreds
[1:46:58] thousands of years
[1:47:00] and it'll still be a log
[1:47:04] but now you take that same log
[1:47:08] and you drop it into a
[1:47:10] nice flowing river
[1:47:14] brimming with life
[1:47:16] flowing eternally
[1:47:20] and what are you going to find
[1:47:23] the log doesn't drink that water it
[1:47:25] doesn't
[1:47:26] have life of its own
[1:47:30] that law will start to rotten
[1:47:33] and crumble twice as fast as if it had
[1:47:36] just laying on the forest floor
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:41] well
[1:47:43] these God's pills
[1:47:46] are there any side effects to them
[1:47:49] there are many side effects to the god
[1:47:51] spills some of them can be quite strong
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:57] your interests are going to change
[1:48:01] you think about some of those things
[1:48:03] that you once used to do things that you
[1:48:04] used to enjoy
[1:48:07] not all of it's bad
[1:48:11] but even then the things that once took
[1:48:14] Center Stage
[1:48:15] the things that once meant the most to
[1:48:18] you
[1:48:19] it might start to change to shift
[1:48:23] your priorities will change
[1:48:26] along with that
[1:48:28] can sometimes be a very heavy price
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:33] you have friends family relationships
[1:48:38] you hung out together you did the same
[1:48:40] things you enjoyed the same things
[1:48:44] and if you start to change
[1:48:49] how can two walk together lest they
[1:48:51] agree
[1:48:54] now
[1:48:57] this is a work that is in you
[1:49:01] the change is taking place in you
[1:49:05] your heart's going to grow more
[1:49:06] sensitive
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:09] and you watch others doing things that
[1:49:13] you once did sometimes it'll grieve you
[1:49:17] you hear them say things do things
[1:49:20] that you know aren't right
[1:49:22] but I don't want you to try to fix them
[1:49:25] that's not your job
[1:49:27] it's not your place
[1:49:28] you leave that to me
[1:49:31] but remember
[1:49:33] they don't understand
[1:49:36] they haven't walked the road that you've
[1:49:38] walked
[1:49:40] they're not taking the same God's bills
[1:49:42] that you are they might be content with
[1:49:44] some of those symptom blockers that are
[1:49:46] out there
[1:49:51] you're going to find that there's things
[1:49:53] in life
[1:49:55] things that you used to consider very
[1:49:57] important
[1:49:58] your job your education
[1:50:02] even your own family sometimes
[1:50:09] but this is going to take first place
[1:50:12] that life as it's living out through you
[1:50:17] there's going to be something inside of
[1:50:19] you that makes you want to protect that
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:22] those other things they're still
[1:50:23] important they're good they're necessary
[1:50:26] you need them for this life
[1:50:29] and they have their place
[1:50:33] but that's the backdrop
[1:50:35] to what really matters
[1:50:37] oh Grace I
[1:50:39] this sounds like a very hard narrow road
[1:50:42] to travel
[1:50:43] [Music]
[1:50:45] but I I do believe I'll make it through
[1:50:48] it
[1:50:51] I know you will
[1:50:52] that's why you're here
[1:50:54] I have to ask though what
[1:50:56] what is this operation going to entail
[1:50:58] ah
[1:51:00] it's a good question
[1:51:03] first we're gonna have to get you ready
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:08] you might think that's complicated but
[1:51:10] it's not
[1:51:12] you take the God's bills every day
[1:51:15] as I said
[1:51:17] study meditate prepare
[1:51:21] and you'll find that little by little
[1:51:23] as you prosper along the way
[1:51:26] you've made yourself ready
[1:51:30] the book even says so
[1:51:34] when it comes to the operation itself
[1:51:38] we're going to wash you
[1:51:40] clean you up
[1:51:41] the antiseptic of the word
[1:51:43] trust me when I say nothing unclean
[1:51:46] makes it through that water
[1:51:50] you're going to need a blood transfusion
[1:51:53] to change out the old life for the new
[1:51:56] after all we wouldn't want a rejection
[1:51:58] of that new heart
[1:52:04] once we go in
[1:52:07] we'll do some cutting
[1:52:09] have to go through and take out some of
[1:52:11] that worldly excess
[1:52:16] things that so easily beset you
[1:52:19] [Music]
[1:52:21] but I want you to know that
[1:52:24] I know exactly how much you can take
[1:52:27] and I won't go any further than you can
[1:52:29] bear
[1:52:31] we're going to remove the old heart
[1:52:35] and we're going to give you a new one
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:40] heart from a living donor
[1:52:44] one that willingly gave his own life
[1:52:47] to save yours
[1:52:49] doctor
[1:52:53] what is this going to cost me
[1:53:00] same as it cost me
[1:53:05] it's going to cost you everything
[1:53:07] thank you
[1:53:10] everything that you thought was
[1:53:12] important
[1:53:17] when you're laying in bed at night
[1:53:20] those old dreams those desires that you
[1:53:23] had
[1:53:24] they can be for good things
[1:53:27] nothing wrong with having Ambitions in
[1:53:29] this life
[1:53:32] we want good things for you
[1:53:35] to have a good life
[1:53:39] but there might be something down inside
[1:53:45] where your own conscience is going to
[1:53:47] drive you
[1:53:48] that those dreams those ambitions
[1:53:51] might have to be turned aside
[1:53:54] changed
[1:53:58] you're going to watch as others build
[1:53:59] kingdoms and gather riches
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:06] but perhaps for you you might have to
[1:54:08] endure hardship
[1:54:11] pain suffering
[1:54:14] if that's the measure that it takes
[1:54:17] is to keep your heart humble
[1:54:23] remember those others they went and they
[1:54:25] seen other Physicians
[1:54:29] they found an answer that satisfies them
[1:54:31] [Music]
[1:54:32] and when they look at you they're not
[1:54:34] going to understand that you went and
[1:54:36] took the surgical approach
[1:54:40] they might mock you
[1:54:46] and the same with those other doctors
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:51] they're going to come
[1:54:53] and they're going to find out if you
[1:54:55] actually have what you say you have if
[1:54:57] you've actually been cured
[1:55:01] they're going to want to run tests those
[1:55:03] medical trials gotta love them
[1:55:05] everyone's got them
[1:55:12] but you have to remember that before
[1:55:14] they ever get to you
[1:55:16] they had to walk straight into my office
[1:55:19] they had to stand in front of my face
[1:55:22] and they had to get permission from me
[1:55:25] before they could ever come in front of
[1:55:27] you
[1:55:29] doctor your permission
[1:55:32] so
[1:55:34] are you the head surgeon the head
[1:55:36] physician
[1:55:37] I know of no other doctor like me
[1:55:43] I care greatly about every one of my
[1:55:46] cases
[1:55:50] of all those that are assigned to my
[1:55:52] caseload
[1:55:54] I won't lose one
[1:55:58] not a one
[1:56:00] doesn't matter what it takes
[1:56:02] they're going to walk right through that
[1:56:04] door the same way that you did
[1:56:06] oh
[1:56:08] and I'm waiting for that last one
[1:56:12] even if it's on their hands and knees
[1:56:16] they will come
[1:56:18] I'm jealous over every one of my cases
[1:56:22] with a great jealousy
[1:56:24] you can look in your chart
[1:56:26] the very hairs on your head
[1:56:29] they are numbered
[1:56:32] you're not going to lose one of them
[1:56:37] huh
[1:56:39] wow
[1:56:41] tell me how that's possible hmm
[1:56:45] do you understand
[1:56:47] everything I've told you so far
[1:56:51] wow
[1:56:54] this is a very hard saying what you're
[1:56:55] telling me
[1:57:01] how can anyone make it through if
[1:57:05] this cost is so great
[1:57:08] I don't want you to worry
[1:57:10] I don't want you to worry
[1:57:14] every one of my patients
[1:57:16] everyone who's on my caseload
[1:57:20] are covered
[1:57:22] by one of the best companies out there
[1:57:25] Blessed Assurance Unlimited
[1:57:27] absolutely fantastic nothing but good
[1:57:30] things to say
[1:57:32] well I I've never heard of them but
[1:57:35] do they offer graveyard plot Insurance
[1:57:37] oh that's some of the best
[1:57:40] some of the best
[1:57:42] you're promised
[1:57:44] you're covered by their policy if you
[1:57:46] have to leave this world that way
[1:57:48] one of these days you're going to walk
[1:57:50] right back out
[1:57:52] wow
[1:57:53] how do you know they can back that up
[1:57:56] I had to prove it
[1:57:59] had to show that the policy held that
[1:58:01] the prescription works
[1:58:04] so I took a little trip
[1:58:06] went and visited the graveyard myself
[1:58:09] spent about three days or so there
[1:58:12] met up in old acquaintance of mine he
[1:58:14] and I don't get along so much these days
[1:58:17] he had some keys
[1:58:21] I took him back from him he wasn't too
[1:58:23] keen on that
[1:58:25] okay
[1:58:27] but the prescription held

[2:02:11] [Music]
[2:02:37] well I've I've done all that I can do
[2:02:42] told Dr Grace that I would follow
[2:02:44] through
[2:02:47] I've followed every word
[2:02:49] I'm just waiting for Grace's call
[2:02:54] you know
[2:02:57] it's interesting how
[2:03:00] some people they they seem to get called
[2:03:02] right away
[2:03:04] they go up and they ask and they're
[2:03:06] treated right there
[2:03:08] but some others they
[2:03:10] they have to work it out over time
[2:03:13] with fear and trembling
[2:03:16] sometimes it seems like we have to
[2:03:19] wrestle all night
[2:03:23] to get the heart changed
[2:03:29] yeah
[2:03:31] don't exactly know why that is
[2:03:37] there's no easy answer to it
[2:03:40] but it's something to do with the
[2:03:41] preparation for a heart that can take
[2:03:43] time all must be made perfect
[2:03:48] everything must be in order because
[2:03:50] Grace cannot fail
[2:03:53] he knows his patience he has a
[2:03:55] tailor-made surgery just for them he
[2:03:59] knows exactly what they need

[2:13:00] atmosphere
[2:13:02] be nice to have you
[2:13:06] all right we'll see you soon
[2:13:10] you lead the way
[2:13:21] God prophesied through the prophet
[2:13:24] and he said I'll write my heart my laws
[2:13:26] in their hearts
[2:13:27] where I put them in the tables of their
[2:13:29] hearts showing that there would be one
[2:13:31] day the dwelling place of God in the
[2:13:34] human heart
[2:13:35] not in the human head but in the human
[2:13:38] heart
[2:13:39] and he said I'll write them in their
[2:13:41] heart and and they'll keep my statutes
[2:13:42] and so forth saith the Lord God said at
[2:13:45] another place in Ezekiel he said I will
[2:13:47] in that day take out your old fleshly
[2:13:49] Stony heart
[2:13:51] and I'll give you a new spirit
[2:13:53] and a new and then I'll give you my
[2:13:55] spirit two steps two parts
[2:13:58] a lot of people even good Christian
[2:14:01] people a lot of people get mistaken in
[2:14:03] that
[2:14:04] they get a new spirit it's not it's not
[2:14:06] God's spirit yet it's the new spirit
[2:14:08] that they get to that they can get used
[2:14:10] to get along with themself and get along
[2:14:12] with their brothers and sisters but it's
[2:14:14] not yet God's spirit it isn't God they
[2:14:16] might get a little happy they might get
[2:14:18] a new spirit and jump up and down and
[2:14:20] run over the floor shout a little bit
[2:14:21] maybe they would speak in a new tongue
[2:14:24] they would run a little bit and think
[2:14:25] they've got the Holy Ghost but it's not
[2:14:27] it yet it's just that new spirit
[2:14:31] after he gave you your spirit then he
[2:14:33] said I'll put my spirit in you after
[2:14:36] that
[2:14:37] that's what's the matter with many a
[2:14:39] Christian today many people will call
[2:14:41] themselves a Christian and do those
[2:14:42] things that they ought not to do still
[2:14:45] it's the person we're after tonight you
[2:14:47] get a change of heart you get a change
[2:14:49] of diet that's right that's good you
[2:14:51] don't want the things of the world no
[2:14:52] more certainly not but when you come
[2:14:55] into the glory of God
[2:14:57] when you come into that place like Aaron
[2:14:59] the prophet entered into the holiest of
[2:15:01] holies and slipped into behind that
[2:15:03] inner Veil and and Aaron walked in there
[2:15:05] and that Veil dropped in behind him
[2:15:07] the world know nothing about it anymore
[2:15:09] he was shut off from the world
[2:15:12] and a man that ever fully surrenders his
[2:15:15] heart and life man woman boy or girl who
[2:15:19] dares to take God at his word
[2:15:21] and say God sanely sincerely I come to
[2:15:24] you with all my heart give me that new
[2:15:27] birth in My Heart Lord and stand there
[2:15:29] under the bloody cross and believe it
[2:15:30] with all your heart something then will
[2:15:33] come to you brother something then will
[2:15:35] come to you sister God will shut away
[2:15:37] all the world and all the things of the
[2:15:39] world and it will become dead and all
[2:15:42] the things that pertain to the world
[2:15:43] will be dead you'll love you'll be
[2:15:45] hidden away
[2:15:46] there's a great artist I can't think of
[2:15:48] his name now but he painted the famous
[2:15:50] picture of Jesus knocking at the door I
[2:15:52] think he was a Greek man
[2:15:54] and when he came he he spent years of
[2:15:56] painting and and there was every famous
[2:15:58] picture as a note every famous picture
[2:16:00] will have to go through every piece of
[2:16:02] art will have to go through a hall of
[2:16:03] critics before it will go through and be
[2:16:06] landed in the Hall of Fame but the
[2:16:08] critics came as they always do and and
[2:16:10] one of the critics said I came to the
[2:16:12] painter and said there's just one thing
[2:16:13] that you lack in your picture
[2:16:15] and and the painters the painter said oh
[2:16:16] well what is that and he said well you
[2:16:18] have a door but it has no latch on the
[2:16:21] outside
[2:16:22] and the painter said oh but I painted it
[2:16:24] that way
[2:16:25] that's the way it is you have the latch
[2:16:28] on the inside and Christ is on the
[2:16:30] outside knocking Christ cannot open your
[2:16:33] heart you have to
[2:16:36] Christ is the one he can neither go into
[2:16:38] the closet that you've got yourself shut
[2:16:40] up in there you've got the latch in your
[2:16:42] own power
[2:16:43] but it's his goodness to stand there and
[2:16:45] knock
[2:16:46] some time ago down in the South there
[2:16:48] was a story of an old Minister that he
[2:16:50] was a wonderful old brother and he had a
[2:16:52] a man that was with them or in and
[2:16:55] around the church but he wouldn't come
[2:16:56] to church they couldn't convince him the
[2:16:58] church his name was Gabriel and they
[2:16:59] called him old Gabe and they would say
[2:17:01] well why don't Gabe why don't you come
[2:17:02] to church and he said oh I will someday
[2:17:05] and one day he and the minister went
[2:17:07] hunting and now old Gabe was a was a
[2:17:09] very poor shot he couldn't hit nothing
[2:17:12] but they went hunting that day and they
[2:17:14] hunted all day long and they came in the
[2:17:15] evening and they were so loaded
[2:17:18] until they could neither hardly wait
[2:17:19] they had rabbits and Duck and birds all
[2:17:22] over them until they couldn't hardly
[2:17:23] walk
[2:17:25] and old Gabe was so loaded and he was
[2:17:27] back behind the pastor and he could
[2:17:28] hardly pack his gun and while they made
[2:17:31] their way down an old familiar pathway
[2:17:32] old Gabe walked up and tapped that
[2:17:34] Pastor on the shoulder
[2:17:35] and he had tears in his eyes and the
[2:17:37] Pastor said what's what's the matter
[2:17:38] Gabe
[2:17:40] and he said Parson Sunday morning that's
[2:17:42] tomorrow Sunday morning you're going to
[2:17:43] find me at the mourner's bench and I
[2:17:46] intend to take my place in the church
[2:17:47] until death sets me free
[2:17:49] and the Pastor said I'm so glad to hear
[2:17:51] that but I have a question for you why
[2:17:54] the sudden change was it a sermon I
[2:17:56] preached to you or was it something I
[2:17:57] said or something I did or something
[2:17:59] that a friend did he says oh no it
[2:18:01] wasn't that
[2:18:04] Parson you know I'm a poor shot and we
[2:18:06] just went hunting
[2:18:07] I can't hit nothing
[2:18:09] but just look at all the game I have he
[2:18:11] was so laid him down he could hardly
[2:18:12] pack his gun with all the Ducks and
[2:18:14] rabbits and all the things that they had
[2:18:16] gotten
[2:18:18] I was just thinking of walking along
[2:18:20] after such a successful day hunting with
[2:18:22] all the things that we got I can hardly
[2:18:23] walk
[2:18:24] he must love me
[2:18:26] there must be something that this great
[2:18:28] God you keep talking about he must love
[2:18:29] me if he would care enough to give me
[2:18:31] that
[2:18:33] if we would only come to a place that
[2:18:35] the Holy Ghost would open our eyes to
[2:18:37] God's goodness to us
[2:18:38] it would bring repentance
[2:18:41] if we could only get our eyes open but
[2:18:43] it's become a common thing
[2:18:47] now remember that you don't see God but
[2:18:49] God seeks you
[2:18:51] and if you're here tonight God seeks you
[2:18:53] not the other way around if you've set
[2:18:55] out on a journey trying to find God it's
[2:18:56] because God's pricked your heart and
[2:18:58] he's pulling you in little by little
[2:19:03] sometimes it takes a while remember
[2:19:04] crucifixion was a slow death
[2:19:07] it took a lot of time to come around
[2:19:10] to a place of death one final story
[2:19:12] there was a story of a man
[2:19:14] looking for a new farm he was a farmer
[2:19:18] he was looking for a farm and he saw a
[2:19:20] land go up for sale a hundred acres of
[2:19:22] Farmland the best deal you've ever seen
[2:19:24] 100 acres of farmland
[2:19:26] and that farmer went out
[2:19:28] and he went to the second farmer and he
[2:19:30] looked to see
[2:19:31] what this land was about it was a
[2:19:33] hundred acres of beautiful farmland and
[2:19:35] he came up to the second Farmer and the
[2:19:37] farmer says I'll make you a deal sir I
[2:19:39] have these hundred acres of land
[2:19:42] but what I want to do is I want to sell
[2:19:43] you the 99 Acres that all 99 of them I
[2:19:46] just want to keep the one in the middle
[2:19:47] it has a special family significance to
[2:19:50] me my grandfather owned it my father
[2:19:52] owned it I want I own it now and I just
[2:19:54] want I'll sell you everything but
[2:19:55] there's just this one little piece in
[2:19:56] the middle I want to keep that
[2:19:59] I just want to keep that it just means
[2:20:01] something to me
[2:20:02] but I'll give you a deal you can't
[2:20:03] refuse I'll give you a price you can't
[2:20:05] turn down and the man the man said well
[2:20:07] he asked what the price was he told him
[2:20:09] the price and his eyes bugged down he
[2:20:10] said well I can't I have to take it and
[2:20:12] he took it
[2:20:14] and he began to farm those 99 Acres
[2:20:16] minus one and they began to farm it but
[2:20:18] there was an instant problem
[2:20:20] because every week that farmer that old
[2:20:22] farmer went to visit that one acre right
[2:20:25] in the middle of his land and he had to
[2:20:26] drive his tractor down the middle of the
[2:20:28] road and tear down all these 99 Acres as
[2:20:31] he drove across that plot of land
[2:20:32] tearing up in mud and dirt and
[2:20:35] everything to get to that little piece
[2:20:36] that that other man wouldn't fully buy
[2:20:38] out
[2:20:40] and I wonder sometimes if we don't leave
[2:20:42] a final acre of our heart undone
[2:20:45] and we say oh it was my grandfather and
[2:20:47] my father and something this and it just
[2:20:48] means something and and the devil we
[2:20:50] allow the devil to have one little piece
[2:20:52] of
[2:20:53] one little piece of something
[2:20:56] and we won't fully sell out and the
[2:20:58] devil's able to drive over our life
[2:21:00] because there's that one piece that he
[2:21:02] still owns
[2:21:05] but there's a time to sell out the final
[2:21:07] acre every part of our hearts brother
[2:21:09] Brandon would say all think today that
[2:21:12] hearts are becoming Stony filled with
[2:21:14] Rich
[2:21:15] indifferent church members lukewarm like
[2:21:18] that rich young ruler and don't know
[2:21:19] that great holy spirit standing knocking
[2:21:21] at the door in this great Leo to see an
[2:21:23] age he will hear that he that will hear
[2:21:25] my voice the word will open his heart
[2:21:28] I will come into him and sup with him
[2:21:30] that spirit is speaking now I'll take

[2:21:57] here for a heart change
[2:22:00] a total heart transplant
[2:22:03] and blood transfusion
[2:22:06] to replace the old life with the new
[2:22:09] we will establish a Sanctified sterile
[2:22:12] field

[2:22:15] make the way ready
[2:22:17] we'll put
[2:22:19] our friend Ethan here out under the
[2:22:21] right atmosphere
[2:22:23] ministered to by our pastor pereza
[2:22:28] we will then wash
[2:22:30] and make the area around the heart clean
[2:22:33] righteous
[2:22:35] pure
[2:22:36] with the antiseptic of the word
[2:22:39] and then we'll cut our way open to the
[2:22:41] heart dividing asunder joint and Marrow
[2:22:45] to reveal the heart's very secrets
[2:22:48] that old Stony heart
[2:22:50] will be removed in a new heart given
[2:22:54] we will then close up
[2:22:57] and the heart will be sealed bringing
[2:22:59] life eternal

[2:43:01] from Dr law
[2:43:02] religion failed to meet my need my life
[2:43:06] was just one black lie
[2:43:08] sin caused my heart to daily bleed Dr
[2:43:12] loss said you must die
[2:43:15] the flesh cried for another way Dr loss
[2:43:19] said there is none the world it said
[2:43:22] you'll see a better day well Dr law said
[2:43:26] you're done
[2:43:28] to Medicine I went to my money I spent
[2:43:31] the psychiatrist even examined my head
[2:43:35] but I would not repent neither relent
[2:43:38] and again Dr law said you're dead

[2:43:44] even though I tried to do my part
[2:43:48] the darkness was of night was everywhere
[2:43:50] Dr loss said you need a new heart
[2:43:54] I replied it's my feet that led me
[2:43:57] astray my hands make me to do what I do
[2:44:00] after Dr loss said have my say he
[2:44:04] replied without a new heart you're
[2:44:07] through
[2:44:08] but I trudged on down the rebellious
[2:44:10] Road I thought I needed a Reformation
[2:44:14] heavier daily became my load again Dr
[2:44:17] loss said a major operation
[2:44:21] my heart would not do I knew this was
[2:44:24] true it was plain I had lost the race Dr
[2:44:28] loss said it's sin you'll never win
[2:44:31] until you go to Dr Grace so I counted
[2:44:35] the cost if my soul should be lost my
[2:44:38] soul cried what must be done there stood
[2:44:41] Dr Grace with a smile on his face saying
[2:44:45] it's not due it's done
[2:44:47] for Christ on the cross suffered our
[2:44:50] loss saying come through me I am the
[2:44:53] door I cried with a loud voice I make
[2:44:57] thee my choice he said go and sin no
[2:45:01] more
[2:45:01] so I praise His sweet name he took all
[2:45:04] my blame for of sin there's not left
[2:45:07] even a trace since that day I saw
