[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] i think we're having church what a great day it's been already this morning we had a breakfast with the ministers we had our brother paul dierksen speak to us i i believe it was just a wonderful time and sometimes we measure great men by great gifts and the things they are brother branham would give us the indication he says not the 200 pound man if it was that brother paul you and i would have been there in that category a long time ago but it's it's bigger than that he'd say it's the one who's got the baggy knees it's the one who can humble himself and he says you know show me a man that can humble himself that's conquered his spirit and our brother paul just spoke to us in a very humbling level about the god that's with us and our part to let him do his part and we appreciate that brother paul we thank you and god bless you for what you ministered to us this morning this afternoon we had a equally powerful meeting brother timothy pruitt ministered and i don't know if you had a chance to listen but i i was in my office i was streaming and i was shouting and i was jumping up and down and i was screaming and crying and and like i said it was good it was it was it was beyond what words can say and we thank god for the gift that was in our brother timothy and i told the brothers i said well that's one that's two but god does things in threes tonight we have a brother with us you may not know him um you may not have heard of him but i want to just say hell has heard of him hallelujah and i say heaven speaks to him and earth is bearing witness that the god of heaven lives in brother ron spencer and it's a miracle and as much as the devil has tried god has sought that this will be a testimony and a strength to the bride of christ i believe brother ron's here by the will of god and we want to just make room and allow them and uh i i was just saying the word is becoming flesh and i would say god has moved in these meetings it's our move this is the day this is the hour and and it all it takes is one little move on your part lord i'm sorry lord i forgive i change my way you can bring the god of heaven into this meeting your amen your identification with the word i'll tell you what the angels of god are here god is here we are here i had this song i felt to maybe sing brother i i just i just if i felt to sing it i promise i won't sing it but i'll have somebody sing it and and mercy said no can can you do a little bit of that for me i just feel god has said no heaven or hell had a plan had a trap but god said no mercy said no i don't know if you can maybe i wanna i don't think you just sing all the verses but if you sing just into a couple of them that'd be fine brother john i was just a child when i felt the savior leading i was drawn to what i could not understand and for the cause of christ i have spent my days believing that what he'd have me be is who i am and as i've come to see the weaker side of me i realize his grace is what i need when sin demanded justice for my soul [Music] mercy said no i'm not gonna let you go i'm not gonna let you slip away you don't have to be afraid mercy said no sin will never take control [Music] oh life and death stood face to face darkness tried to steal my heart away thank you jesus [Music] for god so loved the world that he sent his son to save us from the [Music] there is still a war that rages and makes the sacrifice so hard to see and as midnight fell on crucifixion day [Music] and as he will start to stop redemption's you don't [Music] sin will never take control life and death stood face to face darkness tried to steal my heart away thank you jesus mercy said no mercy said no i'm not gonna let you not gonna go you slip away you don't have to be afraid mercy says [Music] [Applause] [Music] darkness tried to steal my heart away but thank you jesus mercy said no hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] brethren's going to come but that mercy is still in the room tonight that god is still here tonight no matter where you are that god is here tonight and his servant is here we're going to invite now our brother ron spencer lord you make your mercies new every day make your mercies new every day you change my life in so many [Applause] you ways me in your sweet grace [Music] there's one thing i know for sure [Music] [Applause] every morning aren't you glad that his mercy is new every morning amen god bless you so good to see you amen i love you with all of my heart and i'm i'm glad i'm here to be able to say that that i love you it's a dream come true [Music] this has been a very emotional time for us we're honored to be here what an incredible meeting i think it's the greatest that i've i've been here and we've had some incredible meetings as it's already been said this is my 25th trip to edmonton brother lynn you were on that first trip and took me to an all-you-can-eat steak i knew it was going to be good and so i'm sorry that i was not able to be here at the memorial service and we have limited energies and limited time and i i trust that you have that you can understand some of that and and so we certainly do do thank you uh we our hearts were here and we sure have prayed for you as an audience but we knew that you were in good hands brother harold had the foresight to have a young guy with him for many many years and watch him grow up and and he has a incredible team around him and and we miss brother harold but god still got a plan and we're honored that we can stand here with brother timothy and brother tim their buddies and you know that they're really buddies and and we've had masterpiece after masterpiece amen brother timothy started then on thursday and then today was over the top this morning this morning i don't i don't know if it was recorded but brother paul that was wonderful it was absolutely wonderful you stood like a statesman and spoke those things and it just blessed our hearts so much last night if you haven't heard it i trust that that has listened to over and over again that was incredible and the great part is about it i found myself in the revival [Music] and i don't know if you know this or not but the revival's not coming it's here [Music] we're not just preaching it's coming it's already here and so we are enjoying it and we're we're seeing his great works and so we think we thank the lord for that and so in the great it has transformed our children and i heard when i heard brother tim as he spoke you know you can't hand it down from generation to generation my son andrew had spoke here he received it on a street corner with brother tom ray and just in an instant he was changed brother matthew that is speaking at home right now at brother tim's meeting at the louisiana camp he just broke out and spoke in tongues all night long and and god just did a work for him and my my baby girl that's the way that she received it and so you may not receive it that way but it sure is good to feel a god that's real close to you and amen and i i so i so love you for those that don't know brother tim and i go a long way back longer than we even realized and he sent me a picture the other day and he was sitting on the jeffersonville branham tabernacle pulpit at 18 years old and so i found out it was 1972. brother minnow i was sitting in the baptistry behind him as a 12 year old boy because there wasn't room in the building so we was that close god had a plan brother tim amen and so we've loved this message all of our lives and we give ourselves to it and and it's just great amen maybe you have a need today and you could like to say as i heard the other night as bartimaeus passed by thou son of david have mercy on me because more than a man is in this building [Music] we're already aware that he's here he's the voice behind the song he's the voice behind the speaker [Music] he's whirling in the building even now now let's talk to him heavenly father [Music] there's just none like you one word from you would change our life maybe it's one sentence in an entire sermon [Music] that would turn our lives entirely around and a multitude of gathering like that is here what an incredible audience but no doubt the unseen audience is much larger than this lord you see where we're at [Music] now father you're not too busy to come to where we're at now i found you a god that's faithful i found you a god that's real you're more than a quote you're more than just a scripture you're a god that can make yourself alive [Music] lord no doubt there's incredible powerful men that's standing in this pulpit that carry your gospel [Music] from outpost into many different regions i pray that that god that you would renew them [Music] recharge them like never before father in this incredible age that we're living in you called us not to just to survive but you called us to overcome now lord jesus i ask you that we can draw strength from you help us dear god today i have incredible needs as i stand behind this pulpit lord i ask you that you would come i call to you i don't call to an idol i call to a living god and you're a god that hears and answers prayer we at times get impatient but you're always on time and we take you at your word oh god now we surrender ourself both as speaker and as here lord come to our pew come to where we're sitting lord minister to our hearts now in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen and amen and amen amen god bless you if you will turn with me in your scriptures today in second corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7. here just a short time ago i was awakened in in the night and i heard a voice calling and so from that that visitation i want to speak to you tonight i heard the voice say in a mess in a mess in a mess second corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7. but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us that's an incredible scripture we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in in our body for we which are alive are always delivered unto death for jesus sake for the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the transgiving the thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction what incredible words no matter how difficult we have it for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceedingly eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen amen you may be seated sometime back i had a vision it was a vision it was probably maybe two years ago brother tim could probably refresh me of that i had a vision of brother tim and myself we were working in a in the evening time it was just getting to the point to where it was we could see images of of people but we we we knew that darkness were comings and we were working before a great gate and we were doing everything that we could to usher souls in through this great light to where there was a the most beautiful light that i'd ever saw light and that light was beaming out of those gates and it's it was just like a a beam of light to kind of give you an idea of what that beam would be like if you could see brother tim's windows on his church that was kind of how it was and and i was telling brother tim the vision one day and and he said kind of like that and there there was there was that that evening light light shining forth like beams of light we were working desperately to get those last souls in now just because i would call brother tim's name all of us as ministers that's what we're doing when this meeting began to be set up and and i'll just be honest with you there were a lot of days that i never thought i would be standing here even after being asked by brother harold and brother ed to come there was a lot of days that even my family said no way you can go there's good days and there's a lot of difficult days when i begin to see that the happenings of the the pope being in the same city and here we are the evening lights and i begin to see how god was dealing for this meeting all the hounds of hell couldn't have kept me from coming to this meeting because i knew this was a place where god's going to have a conference with his children i want to share with you a prayer before we get started he said now i'm going to pray for you the bible said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up and if i have found grace in the blessed god may this be the night that they'll never forget could this be a night that we'll never forget may the holy spirit come into every heart just now and just move off out of all everything all the sickness from their body notice how it stands in authority i now challenge the devil to a debate satan you're aware that you are whipped you have no legal rights jesus christ my lord stripped you of every authority that you had when he died at calvary to take away sin and sickness and you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff you know that when the lord came to the tree and he cursed that tree the next day it withered and our lord said to his disciples have faith in god for if you shall say you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that you will have what is said it's coming to pass you can have what you have said satan you know the scripture on that and i have just taught this people that god is in them god is in them i want to say it again god is in them [Applause] and if god is in them they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease has to move for christ said so for it's not them that speaks it's the father that dwells in them that's speaking they're in need so come out of them in the name of jesus christ i say it's god's servant by this message of the angel who anointed and has proved to the people that jesus is here and the message is right so come out of them in the name of jesus christ i adore you by the living the the every to leave every sick person and to get out of outer darkness in the name of the lord jesus christ and you that are message believers all of these years you know that god vindicated right behind that and a wind blew through that building as i stand here today and realize that every 24 hours is important today i i sat with at the table brother paul was speaking and we had breakfast it was arranged for us to set in certain spots i sat with sister connie who was my queen sister leanne sister shelley warrior i sat with some of the queens of heaven also sister mary and brother jake sat there and i thought about how god arranges everything the last time that one of the last times i was here in the final service we sang on the wings of a snow white dove and i witnessed the the dove of the holy spirit fly through this building and that and that that day brother ken would get a touch get a reprieve and go to meet the lord in just about a month or six weeks eight weeks something like that as we sit there and we begin to talk this is a very temporal land we have come to this spot maybe maybe maybe you don't understand but we have come to a spot in our lives that that every day that we live is a miracle i would like to say this to you i'd like to thank you for every prayer that you've prayed you've called you've called my name and prayed with us i'd like to thank you for that every card that you have written to me for those that don't know i am battling stage four cancer with multiple tumors in my brain my lungs is full of cancer and in some of my lymph nodes it's affected a couple of different organs and killed my pancreas and also my adrenaline glands i take chemo twice a day and about about 20 different supportive drugs that goes with all of that but let me just say this to you they said i would live for about four months but i read another report may as i just take some opening thoughts and i hope this is okay i i asked brother ed if it would be all right i stand here and i declare to you the infallible word of god while yet satan has decided that he would bombard my body with cancer but he couldn't do that he could have never touched my body except for he got permission from my god and before he touched my body god gave him permission because god had confidence in the seed that he placed on the inside of us so no matter the battle that you're going through god has got confidence in you [Applause] and to be honest with you every one of us are under a death sentence if the rapture don't come every one of us are under death sentence but god is is faithful to us brother tim nunwell are they just saying for us he's been a ghost writer for me and he just in the right moments he will he will write me things and i want to share a couple things with you today before i go into my text i hope that's okay on the roughest days the lowest hours of despair even in those times we're still chosen blessed favored forgiven loved let of god victorious inherit all of heaven's glory privilege to walk with our our own creator we're married to the queen the king of heaven and he calls us the beloved we're strong in faith we're armed to fight devils we're entrusted with god's word the most powerful weapon protected by the arm of the almighty he has placed us hedge about around us we have an assurance that each time that we call he hears the answers and the answers for our good yes in a mess don't be surprised when you find yourself in a battle for your life not just for your natural life for your spiritual life we're at the end of satan's war against the bride of jesus christ because even he senses we're getting ready to leave and he's turned loose every force against us because he don't have long could this be the last meeting could these be the last services that's what he has to deal with [Applause] as ministers you think you've come through the message and know all the doctrine let me just say he's calmed he was there when it was preached it was there when it was put on paper and put on tape and put put in computer he's been studying this message a long time to try to defeat you but because you're elected and have the seed of god on the inside of you that god zones himself lives then on the inside of you you take that same anointed word and defeat the kingdom of hell [Applause] don't be surprised when the battle comes your way you don't choose your battles none of us choose our battles on december the 22nd of 2020 19. i heard the voice of god speak and maybe you say well brother on men don't hear that no more that only went to a prophet well you you're obviously not been in none of these services and god spoke to me said if you trust me i'll use you like never before let me just say i stood in a lot of a lot of pulpits and preached and and a lot of incredible meetings and taking place i've seen cancers come off i've seen the eyes open i i've seen ears come i've seen limbs grow i've seen dead babies that were getting ready to be delivered in a few days those babies be born well alive we've seen wounds become fertile we've seen the dead raised we've taken a hold of crippled bay legs of of children and and literally watched them run across the buildings we we've seen men walk all the way from the back of the building with braces on their legs and and crutches and and all around walking and as the word was going forth getting toward the front of the building throwing down their canes and taking off their crutches and dancing all over the building so maybe we were expecting maybe even a higher realm of that not knowing that god was going to allow us to go into a battle to encourage you that no matter what you face in life god will be with you [Applause] got some signals that things were beginning to happen brother tim brought us rocks from where david picked up stones in that valley brother kelly brought us a coin that commemorated normandy that said except nothing but full victory a brother walked in my back my back office door he had wanted to buy me a real high-priced rifle and i told him i had i i really i really didn't want him to do that i didn't want him to spend that kind of a money he said i just want to do it for you and he he went to prayer and in prayer the lord spoke to him and said he needs a sling and he walked into my office the very night that we were getting ready to tell the audience that we had cancer and they were we were ready to enter into the battle of cancer and he all walked in and handed me a sling to go with those rocks god was going telling me [Applause] i got your battle [Applause] time becomes so incredible precious let me just say this to you at this point you may be so busy in life that you're not taking time for your family but let me just say that's one of those precious things that there is your amen should have been a whole lot better than that family time is so awesome last monday as they were putting me to sleep for an operation last monday they were putting me to sleep for an operation they had been in the in the room with me for about an hour and doing all the interview and everything that they were going to do and they were the lady that was going to put me to sleep she was such a nice lady and and she took me through through all the facility there wanting me to meet everybody and she said you're a celebrity here in our hospital and so and so she was taking me through and i got to meet people and and when they took me into the operating room to roll over my side and they put the apparatus in my mouth and over my head and began to tie me down she said now i want you to think on what makes you so happy she said what what makes you so happy and i said spending time with my family that's what heaven's gonna be like [Applause] amen i didn't go to sleep as they were giving me the medicine she said ron it's okay to relax just relax now and breathe real deep and she told the other girl she said i think i've lost my touch well in a minute she proved she had to touch my queen sits here 39 years we just had an anniversary she's been so incredible faithful incredible faithful to be with us we've been in so many doctor's appointments about every week we're we're in one or two doctor's appointments and we've been given an incredible team most of them are catholic but almost every one of them say your god and they they told me the other day said we've had hundreds pass while you've been here but you look like a picture of health that's our god let me just say this to you as i would whisper to devil the devil's ear he could have he would have killed us if he could have [Applause] the pain that we suffer it's not permanent for you may be the darkness that is around you and you may think there's no way out of it let me just say there's a man here that can turn on the lights [Applause] [Music] now as i begin to work my way i want you to understand that no matter how difficult your situation is god's greater [Applause] no matter how many times he knocks the devil knocks you down get out [Applause] get up you have heard me preach positive for for now decades but no matter how difficult the morning no matter how many times we up chuck we just keep getting up [Applause] i want to quote brother ken he quoted it from muhammad ali he said muhammad ali was in a fight and it seemed like he was going to lose and he was up against the ropes and he said muhammad ali got his his opponent right up into his ear and he whispered in his ear and said is that all you got come on brother ron but i've never heard a preacher open a service like this in a camp meeting you've never heard a preacher stand where i'm standing so it gives me license to tell you in the midst of a battle you've got a right you've got a response to speak right back to the enemy no matter how difficult that it is you got a right to speak back to him [Applause] sister melody our trials may be deep and dark but god's greater than our trials i'd like to say to to the enemy i'd like to warn him he thinks he gave me a death sentence but he's really got one [Applause] my journey like yours has a lot of difficulties in it we have to battle there's no days off but i want to say this to you your battle may be difficult but don't you never give up young people don't you never give up moms and dad don't you never give up brother ron but that's a simple statement is it brother branham felt like giving up other great prophets felt like giving up so you're going to be tempted to give up you're going to be tempted to quit going to church but there's something on the inside of you keeps telling you keep going keep going keep going [Applause] your trial don't own you your trial don't own you you may be in a horrible mess today and don't see your way out and it looks so dark just follow the glimmer of light it'll lead you to the day many of our wars are extremely private mind the incredible surgeries brain surgeries shots we take about eight shots a day the invasive test because they've got to see if it's growing if it's moving they constantly repeat brother branham's words satan runs it hides it lives on living cells it don't have a life of its own but it's a death cell so it's trying to suck the life out of you they quote our prophet over and over again i wonder where they got that from seizures brother ron why are you telling us that i i want to just tell you this goliath will always remind you how big he is goliath will always tell you how big he is but there's a rock that you picked up [Applause] that will fly with supersonic speed that's what brother branham said it'll fly with supersonic speed that will go through any but you've just got to have the faith to sling the rock [Applause] i'm afraid people take for granted that these are the ways that things is always going to be maybe we could think of left behind i don't want to be left behind i don't want my children to be left behind i don't ever want to take a service like this for granted [Music] sometimes we have a lack of appreciation of the value not knowing the cost of what it takes to get a man to a spot a profit to a spot to where he can stand there with the authority of the word of god and speak the seals and speak in chronological order the mind of god and then standing on this on the wings of a snow white dove though all of the criticism the light of the nonsense through the backdrop of a lot of things happening in the world the message got through a lot of people wants the message or they want the life but they don't want to pay the price people refuse to commit is this okay they refuse to commit because it's going to take some cost it's going to take some flesh and skin it's going to take your life i want to say this to you quit is not in my vocabulary i have been asked over and over again by some of the greatest doctors are you ready to quit are you ready to give up give up are you being serious we're just getting started when i hear the doctors tell me that every day is a miracle i'm glad i can enjoy every day brother tim i i haven't found you yet i've looked he sent me this he said we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender [Applause] hallelujah may i say this in this meeting though it looks like we're in a mess we'll never surrender we will fight for our families we will fight for our children we'll fight for our healing we'll fight for our deliverance we will fight for joy we will fight for peace we will fight for the holy ghost we will fight until our bodies are changed we will fight till we're sitting at the marriage supper of the lamb in the darkest of your days god's working when you don't see god working he's working [Applause] when it looks like you're losing he's working [Applause] he's not the kind of businessman that gets in the middle of a project and says i quit he has provided the way [Applause] he has all it takes to get us through [Applause] heard last night revival killers i'd like to speak to to some personal things personal things will distract you personal friends who are miserable want you to be miserable because they're a mess hurt people that no doubt didn't want to be hurt will later hurt other people generally they don't hurt people that they don't know they hurt people that's closest to them i'm preaching to you now the spirit of hate is the very opposite of love you may think i'm way off or trying to give you some psychology but i'm actually talking to you right out of where brother branham talks about the magnet hate is the very opposite of love you know it takes a lot of energy to hate it takes an absolute lot of energy to hate and satan has spent all of his energy against you because he hates what you're doing jesus had his critics you're going to have yours if you don't know this maybe you're young enough you don't know this but critics are driven to tear you apart satan anoints people pastors all over the building you understand what i'm saying right now satan anoints these people with a spirit and they the life of power and death is in a tongue and so they will use that tongue of negativity to try to put you in a mess our response is to stay focused and overcome brother ray we are on a mission we're sealed with the holy ghost satan might be able to touch your flesh and he might be able to touch your spirit but he can't get to that gene seed on the inside of you [Music] and if you can just stay in the word of god the whole the whole armor of god that has been given to you it is the spoken word and if you can quote it across your lips whether you're feeling it or whether you're not feeling it [Applause] [Music] so many people are against emotion but i don't know about you i like emotion [Applause] i don't think you have to have a motion to get the new birth but i'll tell you what the new birth will cause you to be emotional [Applause] the new birth is a mess we heard it last night i'll get to it in just a couple of moments brother branham was an emotional man he was running around a tree he was going across the pulpit over and over with his jacket over top of his head he found himself sitting on the pulpit going up and down the aisle pulling his pants legs up he was running in and out of buildings even while he preached you may not hear that but he did those things but but let me just say this you he was an emotional prophet now for you young guys you may not understand it but you will want to marry an emotional woman you don't want to marry a mannequin she may smile at you all the time but she won't cook she won't clean and i'm not even going no further [Applause] so many people want church like that and that's why churches have become a mess they've become an intellectual ted talk because preachers that don't have the holy ghost can't [Applause] ice machines produce ice cubes and a preacher that's got the holy ghost and fire in his life he's got passion and he's driven and he can see that the world's in a mess and we don't have a lot of more services to go to and we've got to give every bit of our energies that we can give and if the song leader challenges to get with me get with him [Applause] well i was born non-emotional well just get the new birth it'll take care of that for you [Applause] we heard last night easy believism easy believism you know i i was raised in the message under a pastor heard the tapes every day every day we we knew the message backwards and forwards church age book was read written we were commanded as children to cut our teeth on the church age book but later here brother tim was much like that i want to say this to you that didn't give me a new birth that put me in the right atmosphere but i needed to meet the author [Applause] [Music] are you with me now i needed to meet the author of the book there's a lot of people that can can tell you about the stars in heaven and and the astronauts and and all those different kind of things but they're scared of heights tell you about the deep oceans and going down to the bottom of the valleys and the oceans and how deep they are maybe even tell you where the titanic is at i was standing i was standing in a hotel today and i was standing beside of a rock fireplace sister connie went to the washroom i was waiting on brother timothy to bring the car around and a man came in he had his work clothes on and another man was with him and and he said i can't remember the guy's name but he called me jack something he jack jack delgado i had no idea who jack delgado was he said jack delgado he said i've i've waited my life to meet you i'm a huge fan of yours and he and he ran over and he grabbed my hand and shook my hand i was just standing kind of startled and and he was shaking my hand and and i and i was standing there and he said take a picture somewhere now there's going to be somebody bright enough to say you didn't meet jack dalgado now here's why i use that there's a lot of people that said in church they didn't meet jesus [Applause] they met the personality of a man and it produces masses it produces lives of carnal nature fusses in the church splits all over the place children that become rotten eggs [Applause] well brother on we're just going to walk away you may survive but your children's not going to survive brother branham said he said if you can look tonight if you could just make a choice tonight five years from now where will we be be a real christian or we could be in the bar room in hell five years from now you'll be amazed making the wrong choices how quick sin will take you down leaving the message is like falling off of a cliff because sin and all the atmosphere of sin and all the sodom conditions that are all around us you never thought you'd have all of those piercings you never thought you'd have all those tattoos you never thought that you'd be an alcoholic you never thought that you'd be a homosexual you never thought you'd be divorced and married to another woman you never thought that the enemy that was at war with you would destroy you but your excuse was i didn't like the preacher i didn't like the message i didn't like what the word said you refused headship [Music] and it produced a mess sometimes we get frustrated we get exhausted we're going to underweight too much pressure if we're not careful we'll have a lack of commitment most talented people are lazy because they can make their way through it but the person that's willing to put their whole life on the line that will take responsibility and realize this is my 24 hours this is my service [Music] [Applause] this is my revival we can't go backwards we can only go forward [Applause] we sat on we sat on the platform in 72 and in the baptistry in 72 we can't go back there our grandmothers grandmothers and our families danced in the spirit it was real bullets shot in and shot on their dresses let me just say it was real and the bullets fell down off of their dresses brother branham talks about that i want a real revival in this day brother branham was even challenged brother minnow he was even challenged by satan himself and the enemy told him god don't love you i want to just ask this audience how many of you have had that same enemy tell you that same thing and then when we're asked this brother branham said just when i was getting ready to give up [Applause] now i want to talk to you strong ones just now you're not the one holding on [Applause] don't roll your shoulders back and think you're holding on as a matter of fact there's a hedge of protection around you to watch over your life and thank god for the devils that we never see or we never get have to fight god fights our battles the enemy tells us nobody cares for you when the opposite is the truth brother ron i have felt like at times given up well let me just let me just share something with you every overcomer has felt the urge to give up every prophet has felt the urge to give up and god made his prophets write it down he wanted him to write it down to let us know is believe us it's not you overcoming it's him overcoming jesus even prayed father if it would be possible let this cut pass from me brother branham felt like giving up presidents feel like giving up kings fill up given up every person that's ever did anything worth doing has felt like giving up i want to read to you my favorite scripture behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire that bringeth forth an instrument for the work i have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn [Applause] so the trial that you're going through you are now a witness against the devil sister leanne you were incredible caregiver sister shelley you're an incredible caregiver to mighty men of god you're going to be a witness one of these days that was the tormentor and based on that god ascend those demons in the outer darkness [Applause] brother ron i i just don't understand i just don't understand why me why me i don't know how long i've been i didn't set my clock i find your clocks don't work here they're two hours behind but sister connie will remind me if i go too long it went too long these seats are hard i know what you're talking about you know what i'm saying right now don't be angels we in church here i want to talk to you about a man that finds himself in a mess brother tim has been doing a series if you haven't heard it go listen to it you got a pastor don't don't do it on sunday morning go listen to it it's talking about all shady our strength can we work out a proceeds offering or something like that i he's been talking about how god is a strength god comes and he calls him and he calls him by his name he takes him on a journey kind of like the one you're on kind of like the one i'm on and he begins to take him on a journey and he didn't know where he was going kind of like the one you're on and kind of like the one i'm on are you getting the gist we don't know where this journey ends but if he's leading we can't lose [Applause] and so as as abraham is taking his journey he begins to witness of what god is doing god told me that he's my shield and he's my buckler he has personally told me sarah that he's got a covenant between me and him and he's telling me things and sarah now i'm just going quickly now sarah he changed my name and in changing my name he put his own breath so every time my name is called the breath of god is praised and worshipped and we find out even now that every time the scripture said let everything that hath breath praise you the lord so literally every time you breathe across your lips and your nose you're actually worshiping god [Applause] so why not praise the lord [Applause] abraham is living just outside there's a split that comes in the church split comes in the church personalities happen abraham has brought along people that he thought were believers and he found out later they really wasn't believers so it costs a split in the church and and he goes and he cast like casts his lots toward all of the possibilities of sodom and as he goes towards sodom he don't never realize he's going to become the mayor and they don't realize how sinful the place is going to be and jesus would bring it up that this age is going to be like that age and so we realize there's a lot of parallels that are happening here this world is a mess and god has spoken through through he has spoken through the pillar of fire he has came down and walked through the sacrifices he's he spoke lip to ear to abraham and he's making his journey and he's telling him because because god has a plan and i want you to always remember at the end of the day god has a plan you were pre-planned you was not an accident as you heard today you were pre-planned you were born on a certain day you were born with certain hair color you were born brother max short but always remember dynamite comes in short packages and abraham is on his journey a fight comes the brethren come lot makes a decision to go god tells him pick which way you want to go listen there will be a lot of people walk away from you let them go let them go bad influences have only dragged you down there's certain friends there's going to be a lot of things you've got to walk away from so and so lot makes his journey now notice when there comes a separation of the two seeds now there's a greater fellowship now there's a greater fellowship now it's more than a pillar of fire now it's more than a voice now it's a man and that man now is there to confirm what he has been talking to abraham about you know sometimes let's just be honest with you there's sometimes we just don't get it we set for decades in a pew saint pew and we just don't get it and all of a sudden this a preacher out of nowhere says something [Applause] and he literally just ignites it amen we had an older brother that was in our church he ran the beach at normandy and he said people were dying all around me and he said when i ran off the boat he said i ran into bloody water people was dying and he said i was just determined keep running and he kept running he said i'll probably die in this water and he said i made it to the sand and he said i got to the sand the whole beach was full of bodies and he said all i knew was keep running and he said he said i got to the wall and i was standing there with my machine gun in my in my hands and he said how did i get here 50 years later he's sitting in a message church and i'm preaching to him god watched over your [Applause] seat he watched over your seat at war he watched over you when you were an alien from god he watched over you when you were making choices that were horrendous choices god watched over you our god don't give up [Applause] abraham has told sarah now we could say for decades that she's going to have a child but she didn't get it because all she saw was her flesh her inability i can't produce the rapture i can't produce the resurrection i can't produce the promised one but one day there was a man walked into the church meeting and they were having communion [Music] no doubt abraham entertained a lot of guests but this was greater than just a gas i don't know where you noticed it there's an atmosphere here now that the guest is in the room [Music] and he's sitting there and he's talking to abraham who already believes now he got to get his bride and it's been a tough day she's all in a fussy quarly stewie she's seen a caravan go down to mrs lott's house and they get all the good stuff and they're out there in that hot desert louisiana and they're in a hot desert she's just complaining but abraham keeps herself in the atmosphere kind of like parents keeping their self in the atmosphere their children's on the way the prodigal's on the way [Applause] and abraham is sitting there and he knows who he is they've had fellowship for quite a while now he's going to do something that he's going to use at the end time that our prophet would say and go right back to that point more than discernment morty than telepathy but an all-knowing god knows where his seed is at [Applause] [Music] turn his back over and over again to the audiences and tell them exactly there's never been a televangelist anywhere in the world come anywhere near close some of you couldn't tell 22 distinct things about yourself and that profit with that messiah sign stand there tell you who you are you knew that tell you what your address you knew that tell you your condition you knew that then take you back 40 years things that you couldn't remember [Applause] tell you where that disease came from doctors have been trying to find it for decades and a profit in a few moments what do you don't realize that god did that same thing in this meeting he started on thursday night and then last night and today and he's doing it tonight we're not going to have another prophet rise on the scene but it's the mighty angel that's among us because you're important enough to come to where you're at he knows what a mess that you're in and he's the fixture of your mass [Applause] and he asked he asked her like i'm asking you now like i'm asking myself is there anything too hard is there anything too hard for the lord there's some things that i'm amazed just now since that happened until our day there wasn't a preacher there wasn't a theologian minor or major prophet but only under the seals picked up that these two old people got a body change [Music] [Applause] because you're people of the open book [Applause] [Music] and so the promise that was for them is for you [Applause] now i want to take you on just a little journey and i won't be long now but brother branham describes that abraham got out of his place and he backslid after all of these processes of god taking him through it god had a plan he had a plan and so and so there comes a famine and we all want the easy way and so they begin to move somewhere between the visitation of melchizedek we're not going to try to be some kind of brain here and figure out exactly what day it happened but somewhere between melchizedek's visit and his promise [Applause] and them getting to a place called greer can you imagine being the neighbor [Music] be in the next 10 over and they have been given testimony maybe you know like we do we want to give testimony of what god's doing and they became a testimony god's been with us all this time and he's promised us we're going to have a baby and they maybe have watched them set up the kin have the fire have the supper have all of those things and an old man goes in with this with his back over an old lady kind of scoots along and she makes her way into tent [Music] and the next morning [Applause] they walk out yeah baby the message was real [Applause] i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them [Music] [Applause] and you start seeing loved ones walk down your your your walkway knock on your door let them in [Music] [Applause] the mass you lived in yesterday is not that mess today [Applause] the backache the headaches well help me preach you know where i'm at once we get a certain age we don't talk about politics no more we talk about the medicine we take but there comes a time where that mass is over with now i want to just capture every one of you now if i can they're on a journey all this is happening god's watching this because he's got a plan because he needs a prophet at the end time to be able to look into the scriptures of things that he has hid and let that prophet's eyes fall on a certain scripture it was more than just the just shall live by faith and a king that was a righteous man an extremely large kingdom is looking for a wife and of all the kingdom of all the kingdom he comes out and he sees abraham and sarah abraham tells because of his backslidden lying nature now he tells his wife his half-sister tell the man that you're my sister listen your choices will now spiral it won't be much longer your choices will spiral now it will go way out of your control because brother branham said that king said i'll take her from my wife now here's what the prophet said you can read it for yourself said the king brought her in he painted her up he put all kind of a jewelry on her that's what the world will do for you because now she's in the different hands [Applause] and the king declares tomorrow think of the timeline tomorrow i'll marry her [Music] i want you to think you can have all your quotes you want now but now abraham has walked with god all of this length of time god's changed his name he's given him everything he's told him to look at the stars he's told him to look at the sand so shall thy seed be but because of bad choices i personally don't believe abraham went to bed i don't believe he went to bed can you imagine the thought of i made choices and let god down i more than know that i'm on target there's people that are sitting here that are living in a mess you need a revival in your life i may never get to preach to you again but i want to preach to you now [Music] you've got off target you've lost your focus you're laying in the darkness another king has got your wife the wife of promise the wife that has been turned young again the wife that is now so beautiful to a king has rejected all the women in his land and now picked your wife [Applause] [Music] i'll make an incredible statement here you've come to a spot there's nothing you can do about it do you think he prayed you hear brother random talk about that vision of the bride coming and he saw all those wicked looking women is this what it's produced imagine how disappointed he felt that moment but god had a plan [Music] young people maybe you've made some choices you heard last night maybe tonight is your first service sometimes we want to avoid the new birth we don't want to die out to our nature we want to go to church but we want our friends we want our drinking buddies we want our associates we want our friends we want our whatever on facebook we want all of those things attached we really don't want to give our whole life as much as me and these ministers here would love to be able to give it to you brother branham couldn't give it to his own children he couldn't give it to his own children why as a matter of fact he couldn't give it to his own self every one of us needed to be born again [Applause] whether it's a pink hospital bed or a hot pin it's a mess and i'm not talking about making a few vowels saying i'm going to come to church i'm talking about a real dying out i'm sorry to hear that so many pulpits are wanting to go away from a real holy ghost birth [Music] but listen there's one feeling but there's many refillings [Applause] [Music] i'm afraid we've lost the art of prayer where that we break through and i'm talking about even us gray heads we still need to break through [Music] brother on we watch your services and you guys are way too emotional just get what we got [Applause] i'm afraid as we heard brother timothy today say we take on a learned behavior and a learned behavior will only take you so far [Music] i'm sorry i went too long but let me just say this you the enemy that you drove out comes back the enemy that you asked to leave all of a sudden comes back and the spider web gets bigger and bigger until you're entangled in a trap let me just say this to you your enemy wants to set a trap for you especially if he thinks you could have the potential of being a devil destroyer [Applause] so he will take the weakness of your father your grandfather your great-grandfather and they have had the new birth and maybe before you ever were born but satan remembers their struggles and so he reaches back and he goes back into that old nature and begins to pull what made them fall what made them strain what made them go through things and all of a sudden it begins to come forward and now it's coming in your life and a spirit begins to move and you find yourself with the wrong kind of friends you find yourself you find yourself in habits you looked at the wrong side now you're with the prostitute [Music] now your marriage is broke up you're in a mess [Music] and too many people sit in messes even around our churches [Music] we're just hoping some preacher will concoct something in the lab to give us enough grace to stay in church because of the mess listen if this ain't for you send it to somebody that it's for wayne lawson was we were standing at a we were standing at a uh national park we're standing on a bridge and we're standing there as there's a a wildlife agent standing there he said brother ron he said right there is where a puts his foot every every time right there see in that sand he said no there ain't no spots around that it's where he puts his foot and he will do that for years he'll put his foot right there he said now if you want to catch him let me know he's your buddy he said if you want to catch him he said you'll find a place where that that animal puts his foot every time he said that's the way the devil will do for you he'll watch you for decades and he'll watch where you put your foot and maybe you like samson will get by for a long time but after a while you're working at a meal and there's people spitting on you and making fun of you but he just kept pushing it was all out of abraham's hands it was completely out of his hands but god had a plan you see christ was going to come through the lineage of sarah and he was not going to let the king of this world mess it up [Applause] no matter how powerful he was and he knew abraham couldn't fix it on his own so he came himself [Applause] that's what he's done in this service he's came himself he's been working on this meeting for months because he knows what you're in and he's wanting to tell you i've come to deliver you [Applause] i've taken your case i am the judge and the jury i am your attorney i've got it all in my hands when everybody else gave up on you i got you [Applause] [Music] the woman that you're going to marry is a prophet's wife the man that's that was with her that's her husband and hamilton no doubt said he lied if you take her to be your wife i'm going to destroy your entire kingdom i'm going to shut up the wombs of every woman in this complete country i'm going to destroy you you take her back to her husband restore the man his wife restore the man his wife and get him to pray for you [Applause] think about the grace of god god overlooked [Applause] he overlooked him getting out of his way he looked overlooked and coming to grier and god said i'm going to take this and i'm going to hide this i'm going to hide abraham's mistake i'm going to hide it that's what he does with your mistakes [Applause] he puts it where the devil can't get to it no more i'm gonna put it in my blood and there's not a devil in hell can find it i can't even find it for myself [Applause] when he was talking about restore the man his wife he was talking about this is my bride [Applause] [Music] and satan you can't have her you can't have her you've done everything you can to destroy her and to pull her in but i got a title deed to her she's bone of my bones she's life of my life she's power of my power [Applause] [Music] when the judgment hammer was ready to fall on you mercy said no [Applause] if our heads could bow just a moment i'm just trying to catch my breath just for a moment you like to say
