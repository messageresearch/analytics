praise the lord praise the lord amen you've said those words they've come from your mouth he's coming after you that's why we're here this afternoon amen how many are happy to be in the house of god how many are happy to have a youth service amen amen i'm sure i'm happy to have one and i got to thinking about it yesterday i thought why do we do youth services why do we take an extra service and just do that because the devil is fighting you extra hard because he knows if he can get the hearts of the young people he can get the next generation and eventually it'll die but there god's program will not be stopped god's promise cannot be put down it could not be put out it must go on amen he has a seed and i believe that's you you got to put your own name there and say yeah brother andrew i believe that's me i'm here because god wants me to be here regardless of who else is here brother timothy's here because god wants brother timothy to be here to speak to us this afternoon and we're so looking forward to it amen the devil knows if you get a taste of victory it's game over for him you say well i still got all these other problems he knows if you just get a taste it's over the rest of those problems will begin to work themselves out because you've got a hold of god let go and let god get a hold of you this afternoon amen i just want to read one quote before i turn it over to brother timothy it says this in the in the message it wasn't so from the beginning brother bannon says if god poured out the holy ghost on the people at pentecost and that was his decision that how that the church must operate under the power of the holy spirit he cannot change that amen he's not going to change it today he says he cannot turn it over and say well i'll give you a bishop or i'll give you this or i'll give you that he's still got to remain with that same decision amen he's not changing it in this generation he's the same god and he says if the church on the day of pentecost received the baptism of the holy ghost and the reaction that came from that baptism of the holy ghost will be the same reaction on every person that ever receives the baptism of the holy ghost amen that's what we're looking for this afternoon i'm not asking for small things we don't want to put god down here and say well i'll just come and ask for a little bit a little problem say lord take full control baptize my heart afresh just pour your spirit out on me let it fall fresh on my heart why don't we sing that song together as we welcome brother timothy to come and speak them this afternoon pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain pour your spirit out on me fall just [Music] me [Music] [Applause] i [Music] i just want to say there's nowhere else to go this afternoon we're preparing food for you just across the parking lot you don't have to worry about anything so let's just shut ourselves in with god now say lord it's just me and you let's raise our hands and say lord pour your spirit out pour your spirit out without [Music] my thirsty soul come [Music] heal my heart and make me [Music] [Music] one more time and [Music] saturate [Applause] my thirsty soul coming fall afresh lord [Music] feel me jesus [Music] heal my heart and make me whole i need you now for your spirit [Music] hallelujah let's just bow our heads together i wonder how many would just lift your hand up to him and say lord fill my cup again heal my broken heart make me whole i need you now [Music] say lord i need you father i'm counting quite an honor to be here standing in this moment we know it's a moment that's been ordained before the foundation of the world you knew every heart that would be here you never knew every broken heart that would be here you never knew that would be here father every situation lord you're mindful of it lord god we just ask that you would come this afternoon and you would touch our hearts by your grace and grace this place with your presence lord that these young folks and older young married folks whoever is here father lord god that they could feel your presence lord they could feel the reality of a living god father we need you lord we ask god that you would be very personal to us you would open our hearts my hearts be open to you lord and you just we open every door lord i know there's been doors that we've kept closed but today we want to open every door and say father come to every place lord feel welcome in every part of my heart lord i give it all to you i surrender my all to you father pour your spirit out on me lord we commit this service to you father i believe we'll reap eternal rewards from it lord as you give us fruit lord today of of your grace and mercy and lives lord there's some here today that didn't even think they would be here but somehow somehow but god came on the scene made a way father and they're standing here today lord they're here for a reason lord they're here for a conference with you that you can reveal yourself to them father that you can show yourself to be the same yesterday today and forever not just their daddy's god or their mama's god or somebody else's but their own true living god visible to them father tangible father we pray we commit this time to you in jesus name amen amen it's an honor to to be here with you today i counted a great honor it's not something that i take very lightly i take it is very important to speak to the younger generation and i know that you're facing a lot of things that a lot of us didn't face when we came up but i will say this god's still god and i know that there's many young people in this generation that are overcoming and and god is raising up amen souls to the kingdom of god and and gifts of god and right right in the middle of the darkest time satan's ever had what a what a paradox and and so i love you with all my heart and and i i'm thankful for this time to speak to you today just going to take a little thought today the lord had laid on my heart for this this time let's turn to john chapter 2 and also revelations 3 as well amen if you don't mind i'm just going to get comfortable here i brother joel forney i don't know how many knows him but he said nobody can preach or fight in a coat and uh i agree with that amen john chapter 2 and verse 13 the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and changer of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small courts he drove them all out of the temple the sheep the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and he said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make my make not my father's house a house of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house has eaten me up amen let's turn to revelations chapter three i'd like to speak to you today on the zeal of my father's house the zeal of my father's house and unto the angel of the church of the laodicean's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing know us not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that they thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come unto him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also have overcome and have sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen god bless you you can be seated today i'd like to speak to you as i said on the zeal of my father's house just looking at this word zeal is a great energy or enthusiasm in pursuit of a certain cause or an objective zeal is all out it's committed it's convicted it's drastic it's extreme it's intense it's passionate it's radical it's severe zeal opposes average comfortable cautious indifferent lethargic moderate normal or usual amen so i believe that uh god is looking for someone who has some real zeal about the things of god as he would have zeal about his father's house as he would see he would come you know he would wanted he wanted someone that would love him he didn't want to give a bunch of rules and regulations and laws and you do this or you don't do that he wanted a people that would love him and you know he didn't want to have to give them you do this on certain days don't do this on certain days uh you know and all the laws and all the regulations and things that he had placed there that was not his desire his desire was somebody that would serve him because they loved him and out of their love they would be committed they would be convicted they didn't have to have a rule or a regulation they didn't do it because it was a rule of regulation they would do it because they loved him and you know i look at at the time in your youth and i i remember you know when i was a young person the energy that i would at once have and and and the zeal for things and all of that and a lot of times you go all in on things you know everything that you do you want to be all out you want to be committed you know you want to you know if you're going to be a snowboarder you want to be all in that you get every all the gear and you get everything that you got to have got to have the best you know you got to do because there's some path there's a passion in there amen for that or if it's a hockey or or football or basketball whatever it is hunting amen there's something there that you want to try to put your passions and your goals and and what you're trying to do now i i i believe that if somebody's a real true hunter and their trophy hunter they're not satisfied with just killing a little spike deer or or a little doe or something they're looking for a real trophy and they'll they'll do whatever it takes to gain that because there's a zeal or a passion there and you know when i and your youth you have a you have the ability or the energy amen to put that kind of passion into things and now me now at 45 one day i used to run down the court and play basketball and i i don't find it that easy to do that anymore i find it that it hurts i find that i just don't have the same zeal for that anymore i i don't really care to do that anymore you know things have changed i'm coming up towards maybe being a grandpa and things in my life things are moving in a different direction but there was one time that i couldn't wait for some guys to call me and say hey let's go play a pickup basketball game let's go play this let's go do that because there was a zeal there was a passion there was something in my heart for those kind of things and you know and i and i'm looking at this as the way you're you're right at the prime of your life to to give everything you have to god amen you don't you don't have to wait till you're 20 or to your 30 or to your 40 to surrender everything and that well then but then you won't have the energy that you have now and god is looking for someone who will be convicted uh committed convicted will be extreme amen you know the world is becoming extreme how come we can't become extreme about the things of god amen they're becoming extreme about their ideas and what they're doing and how they're doing things and they become so extreme and so passionate about their rights and and all that they got you know they'll go out and they'll paint their hair purple they'll tattoo their bodies they'll they'll pierce their bodies they'll do why because they have a passion towards that and i have to think that on the other side there's a people with a passion there's young people with a passion towards the things of god amen that is not just a bunch of rules or regulations or ideas of men you don't look at it that way but you do it because you love god you do it not because your pastor said it or your daddy said it amen but you do what you do because you love god amen that's where it has to be you know i i don't look at this message as a bunch of rules and regulations and things i look at it as a love of god that has been poured into this generation a love for me that he would find me in my sin and he'd find me in my doubt my unbelief and he'd find me you say well brother timothy he was born in a christian family you was born in a preacher's home you're a pk you know you got it all you was you yeah i had more pressure than most people had amen but yet i was one of the biggest hypocrites anybody had ever been because i could act the part i could look the part i could i could do it all but inside of me i didn't have the love for but one day god came on the scene for me and it began to show me that it wasn't just for my father it wasn't just for my mother it wasn't just for somebody else it was for me and i want you to understand god is trying to show you this morning or this afternoon that amen it ain't just for your daddy it ain't just for your mama daddy may be passionate about the word of god mama maybe but god wants to place that same passion on the inside of you amen i love that it can be a love affair between you and god you know but i i know one of the hardest things for young people to accept is love real care you know nobody cares nobody understands nobody knows what i'm going through nobody nobody knows the situation that i'm facing nobody would understand if i tried to sit down in a two and three hour conver conversation because i you know i'm on my own that's just what the devil is wanting you to think he's trying to pull you away now hasn't he devised such a plan in the last few years as he's pulled people away and we've had the social distance we've had a quarantine we had to pull ourselves back and we've been in fellowship and he's trying to get people alone so they'll think that nobody loves them nobody cares nobody understands but let me tell you something your mama your daddy loves you amen they love you with their hearts they love you amen and even if correction sometimes seems hard and it seems like why you don't know why they're doing it because they love you amen this is where god would say amen i i have to bring this correction but i'm doing it because i love you amen see amen see so if god is looking for you to be as i have zealousness or or zeal about you he would not pl i want you to do that without him being that himself so we've just read the scripture as he would do what he'd done the disciples will remember amen what the prophet had spoke about the zeal of my house amen so i want to look at a few things on zeal because god is not lazy concerning his word god is going to bring to pass his word he's going to perform what he said he would do therefore he has a passion to watch over and to bring it to pass we can read in isaiah 9 and verse 6 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and the name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this amen i'm going to watch over this and i'm going to make sure it's going to happen and he was watching over a little teenage girl and watching over her womb and watching over her purity and watching over her to make sure she was there at the moment amen to meet the angel of god that god could come and bring her a special visitation and what was born in her was not born a man but born of the holy ghost and he was zealous and he watched over and he made sure it would come to pass we look in isaiah 59 and verse 16 he said he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought him salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothes and would clad with a zeal a zeal as a cloak amen he put it on as close he put it he surrounded himself in zeal according to their deeds according he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will pay recompense so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west from the glory and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall raise up a standard against him the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit is upon thee and my words which i put in my mouth shall not depart out of the mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the lord from henceforth and forevermore he said i'm going to clothe myself with zeal as a cloak and i'm going to bring this to pass amen i want you to understand your enemy is not going to get away with what he's done to you but god is going to pay repay him recon recompense to what he has done to you amen he's not going to get away with nothing the devil is not going to get away with tormenting you and spirits that's coming against your mind he's not going to get away with it but god is going to bring judgment upon him [Music] ezekiel 5 and verse 11 says wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou has defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thy abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall my eyes spare neither will i a pity a third part of thee shall die with pestilence and with famine shalt thou be consumed in the midst of thee the third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and i'll scatter the third part with all the winds and i'll draw so out of sword after them thus shall my anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury to rest upon them and i will have comfort and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal amen when i have accomplished my fury upon me and we also find that not only does he have a great zeal towards your enemy or to somebody that willfully disobeys him but he also has a great zeal for you zechariah 1 16 says therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built upon it saith the lord of hosts and a lion shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts i was zealous for zion with a great jealousy i was jealous it's the same word i was jealous was for zion with a great jealousy i was jealous for her with great fury so god has a zeal for you he has a passion for you [Applause] god loves you even when you think yourself to be unlovable or anybody else don't love you or anybody else don't care god loves you god cares about you god knows what you're going through he knows the mind battles he knows the spirits of oppression he knows the things that are coming against you time after time after time and the doctors want to say well you got this problem and you got that problem no it's a devil that's coming against you but god is going to bring recompense upon your enemy and bring him down for destruction [Applause] the devil will not win now that ought to make us rejoice right now because some of you the devil's been tormenting you and he's been telling you you ain't gonna make it he's been telling you your daddy might have been okay but you're not okay he's been telling you you're going to hell he's been telling you you're losing he's not been telling you you're going to lose everything he's been telling you all kinds of things you know what he's doing he's telling you his own thoughts [Applause] because that is what the word has said about him he's going to lose everything he's no he's not eternal he's going to hell hallelujah if he told you you're going to hell that's only because he has seen it in the word for himself he knows what his end's going to be and he's only trying to give you his thoughts [Applause] he has such a passion for his word he has such a passion for his people he has such a passion for his house and i ain't just talking about this wooden structure here i'm talking about these these buildings of clay sitting right here in front of me he has such a passion for what goes on on the inside of there he has such a passion jesus found they had turned sacrifices into traditions and this is where we got to be very careful that we don't turn this message into nothing but a tradition a learned behavior we're not interested in a learned behavior we're interested in the life of the message there is a life amen to where it becomes such a just a form of worship to where they made it into a money-making deal and that's all they had thought about was you know to be and they made it easy for everybody you know you just come up here and instead of raising the lamb instead of it becoming part of you and part of your your your of what you've done and you've put put your time and effort into it and you now you just come here and you pay a few pennies and or pence and you get you a dove or you get your lamb it's already provided for you listen we want more than that we want something that's real and i mean you can this this what this life cannot be handed down listen as much as i would love to i would love to just hand it to my son or hand it to my daughter it can't be handed by me it only can come from god himself but god has such a passion amen for his word and for his people that he'll provide a place to where they can come in the right atmosphere and god can draw them close to him and have fellowship with him and love affair began god is passionate for you john chapter 2 and verse 17. i'll read it again in another translation and this is where i heard this many years ago and preached from this his disciples remembered that the scripture said my devotion to your house o god burns in me like a fire like a fire something like jeremiah would say it's like fire shut up in my bones amen there's something that's going on the inside of me that i can't contain it no more i want everyone else to know hey man you listen we want a revival you know where the revival starts with amen it starts with me it starts with you it starts individually amen you know the brother brandon said if we can get one or two people on fire for god it'll do more for a church than 40 revivals amen what can this church these young people do to this church if you get one or two of them on fire and it begins to spread it begins to move and it begins to go over here and then all of a sudden there's a passion for the things of god oh you got a passion for hockey and you got a passion for this why don't you turn your attention towards something that's eternal i mean i think about it you know we just had i just read the day that finally somebody won wanted but they had such a passion for this lottery that was going on you know it's building up and building up and it's getting up to one point something billion dollars and people were like well what could i do if i got that and what could i do if i could buy this and i could do that i could pay off debt and i could buy three homes that i could buy 10 cars and i can buy it i can buy and i can buy they had a passion and they would do whatever they could to go buy them a ticket and they would get lines or whatever it takes i got to have one of them and i got to have just a chance of winning just a chance listen i want you to understand you're here by more than just a chance you're here by the predestinated will of almighty god and we're not here to win something that's just a temporary moment and a temporary pleasure and 1.3 billion dollars can burn in an instant and be all gone and worthless but i'm here to tell you there's something that you can be passionate about that's not going to go down it's not going to wear out it's not going to be a gone and one day one here the next and day the next day it's cold no this word is eternal oil and there's a young people that say i have a passion for the things of god the seal of my father's house is heating me up [Applause] some of us can tell about i i i'll be honest with you i couldn't i can't hardly name even a couple hockey teams but i guarantee you that someone here can name not only every hockey team they can name every person on the hockey team how many [Laughter] how many goals and how many of this and how many of that and how many penalties and he spent this many minutes in the penalty box and why you had a passion for it but if you turn that passion toward the things of god then you would know what the preacher is talking about when he said brother branham said and oh you know what i just read that i just heard that on the table that that does something for me amen let's turn to such and say i just read that this morning and so why because there's something on the inside of you that is wanting more of god [Music] amen he's a god of zeal he's not lazy he's not lethargic he's not indifferent concerning his word or concerning you he's not sitting up in heaven and drinking his glass ice tea and he's like well boys it's pretty bad down there it's so bad it's gotten so dark let's just see who makes it out let's just see how it's going to work out let's just see if it's going to work out right and it's going to be okay let's see if there's maybe five comes out no he's got he's got lights burning down there and he's watching over them just as he was amen watching over those three hebrew children and they were going down towards that fire amen god was watching he's not indifferent towards your situation he cares about it you may feel people are indifferent and they don't care and maybe they don't but god cares you know i was in uh i was in kentucky one time in louisville kentucky and i i was we was actually there for the national dairy goat show we had dairy goats at that time we were there for the national dairy goat show and brother um um my goodness the name is slipping me right now the brother there in louisville had invited me and um brother tim to minister at his church on sunday and we're there and i come out dad preaches sunday morning i preach sunday night and as i'm walking out god just drops a thought in my heart and i go out and preach and let my people go just took the scripture out

was just asking god i was look lord please i got to hear from you one more time that you you really care about my situation i i want to hear one more time and i mean i was going to talk about i said it would be so wonderful if god would just let us know we're in such a terrible situation we don't know which way to turn but i know i heard last night god cares and i want him to i want to know this he cared about me and i just looked at it and i said sister i wasn't ever planning on being here i didn't have no my mind to be here matter of fact i was supposed to already be back i said but i was driving by here and god spoke to me and said come in here and and this lady sent me all the way across here to be in your section i said i'm guessing i'm here to tell you one thing god cares amen maybe that's all i can get over you today amen god cares about you you say well i lost my loved one god cares i mean i've been through a lot of battles god cares i'm having a lot of mental issues god cares i'm having all kind of problems god cares and he's zealous about you and he wants you to know i love you [Applause] amen [Applause] i know how it is though with young people they get they get to this place you know you ask them how you doing i'm good hey don't look at me like i'm crazy i was a young person too been a few years but i was there more years than i cared to admit but i was there i'm good it's cool what's all the words now i don't know there's there's words now that i don't even know it's all good and meanwhile their minds have been torn up inside they're so wore out spiritually and they and they're so tore up to where devils are talking them into suicides oh yeah i know i'm i know where i'm at amen you get situations and the devil makes you think you're so alone and nobody cares about you and nobody understands amen and you're by yourself and you're he's just about to talk you off a cliff but god cares and he's zealous enough to let you know he'll send a crazy guy from louisiana amen all the way up here with a crazy accent and i act crazy and looks crazy to tell you i love you i created you matter of fact i have wrote your names in the palm of my hand i cared so much for you that i came down and i became a young person just like you are so i would know what it was like to deal with young people's thoughts i would know what it's like to have to deal with a suicide demon that would come against me and say hey just throw off throw yourself off of this building and we'll know your god what was going on glory jesus was having a mind battle the devil was working on him trying to take his very life in a perverted way he was going to give us life but the devil was trying to take his life this is what god wants you to do he don't want to take your life he wants you to give your life give your life to him and let him do something for you [Music] he's a god of zeal he's not indifferent concerning you he knows what you're going through the zeal the lord will the host lord of hosts will perform what he said he would do you know brother brown was set like this with spiritual adoption he said how i want him to say well done amen not by the skin of my teeth but it was well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord for you did well with what you had to do with you say well brother timothy i'm not as gifted as some of these well i ain't either amen i don't want to pick on our young brother right there the redheaded fellow but when god poured out the gifts he poured a bucket on top of him and i get jealous i want to play the piano i want to play the guitar i want to play the bass i want to do that but that wasn't what god gave me but no matter how you how insignificant you feel today and you feel like i can't do anything you're still important to god [Laughter] you say well i just feel like nothing well let me tell you if you feel like you're the skin on the bottom of his feet try walking without skin on the bottom of your feet it's not possible it hurts get a little cut down there and see how hard it is to walk and that skin becomes very important amen but i can read over in revelations 10 when that angel put his foot down upon the land upon the sea amen he's putting it over the amen over the demon powers in the land and in the sea and when you might be the skin on the bottom of his feet but guess what that still means every devil's under you so you're very important to the economy of god you're very important to this church or whatever church you go to even though you may not feel like it well i'm not a soul leader i'm not this i'm not that but be the best a manner you can be be the best christian you can be show the love of god greater amen do whatever you can for the kingdom of god amen you may not be but somebody in the little orchestra that just does a little tinkle tinkle sound but when you get your time play it with all your hearts give everything you got to this gospel never forget my uncle that lives beside me had a grand has a grandson and he got into video games and he became very good at video games and it took up all of his time and his efforts and he became very zealous about this game and that game and he can tell you all about it you know we had a guy show up at youth camp somebody had brought him one of he was a friend of one of the kids that was supposed to be a message kid anyway they'd gotten a video game world and this boy showed up you know what his claim to flame fame was he was number three in the world whoa at a video game and when he dies that's all he's got number three in the world number three in the world number three in the world and all the time and the wasted effort he gave and he was so zealous and he was so into and so passionate about to where he became number three in the world and that's his claim to fame and my uncle would tell this grandson he said son you know if you'd put as much energy in that video game you'd put it in he bought it and bought him a nice guitar and he brought it to him he said i want i i want you to take this guitar and i want you to put as much energy and passion in this guitar as you have those video games and let's see what god will do with it before long that bad boy became he's actually really a world-class guitarist because it became his passion it became everything that he thought about and direct i mean you'd see him at a you'd see you'd see him at a youth event he'd have his guitar you'd see him after church he'd go out and sit on a on the on the tailgate pull it down on his truck and they're out there playing on his guitar it became his drive and his passion amen and i tell you young people if you would have that and you would turn that energy you got towards the things of god toward the things of god and the tapes and reading your bible and praying amen you would be a lot further down the road amen the bible says seek ye first the kingdom of god our passion becomes this boy or this girl or this what am i going to do for a living what am i going where am i going to go to school and that becomes our thoughts and our drives amen your first thought and your first passion should be the word of god because he said seek first the kingdom of god and all these things will be added to you i want him to say well done i just heard just heard of a young lady left a message turned it down walked away went down the road to those disbelieve the sign people come back now she got tattooed across her fingers well done she said i wanted to tattoo it on my hands because i know i'll never hear it that hits pretty deep i want to hear it i want to hear him say you've done well he says maybe you're a housewife if you are god made you a teacher of your children do a good job of it but regardless of what you do do it well notice he said if the children did prove to be real worthy of things the father had in his kingdom it's in spiritual adoption he said he'd been faithful child the tutor brought the message oh your son he said that's what the message i wanted to bring for you and i your son his whole thoughts are upon you all he's trying to do is please you he's so interested in your affair until it's hard to hold him down he said i would rather be a little overzealous about the father's kingdom than to have no ze zeal for it at all he said the church the christ preacher told me some time ago brother branham i would rather wear out than rust out he said that's a lot of truth i would rather wear out than and die in the harness than to refuse to have the harness on you can't do nothing any worse than neglect to try let us do all we can with what we have to do with hallelujah but the question is why when god makes a provision or makes a way of escape for people and they refuse it then god asks the question why this is jeremiah 8 and verse 22 he says is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered this is a question that jeremiah under inspiration of god asked as he brought this message many years ago to the temple the city and the people had all together gone away from god and god told jeremiah to told jeremiah the prophet to go stand the gate and say these words is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there and if there is why is the health of my daughter my people which is the church not recovered the question is why when god makes the provision why would we not take it when god provides the ability to live an overcoming life why would we not accept it when god gives the ability amen to live above sin and live above pornography and live above things of this life why would we not accept it he said i wonder he said when this united states of america which is my home sweet home when god's great book is opened at the day of judgment and this nation is brought under judgment when he points his finger to the ministries that have crossed four back and forth to this nation preaching the gospel showing great signs and wonders of his coming and the angels of god who accompany the ministry standing there to witness when america has asked why did you not repent he said i wonder what answer they'll have but when they continually give it listen this give in to the devices of the devil as the gospel moves they become more radical in their sin every year then well let me see what year this one this was 1959 imagine what he would say today they become more radical in their thinking and more radical in their ways and more radical to where we are now not considered normal we're far from normal the world is what they consider normal what's normal now is to have amen same sex marriages and all these that's what's normal now it's almost more normal amen to have a purple hairdo than have a black hair red hair or any kind of other it's everything else has become more normal sin has become greater so we're living in that great day when great signs of the lord are appearing ministers anointed with the spirit of god are preaching their hearts out and people are still ignoring it he said i wonder what kind of answer is going to be given at the judgment why did you not accept it why well i wanna i i just gotta know it's god well you know there was a man one time there was flood came in his house the water was rising rising rising and he was sending out signals help help help i need help i'm dying i'm going to die my family's going to perish man comes in a boat comes by pulls up to his house says get on man said no he said i'm not going to get on that i'm waiting on god few water kept going until he got on his roof and he gets up to where there's just barely enough peak up there and he's got his little family huddled up and the helicopter comes on drops a basket and says get on he says no i'm waiting on god and the parent they end up perishing and they go before god and god said he said well god why didn't you help me he said what do you mean why did i help you i sent a boat i sent a helicopter i said okay you just would not accept what i had sent amen we don't want to be a guilty of that amen when we get on the other side we don't want to hear the question why we want to hear well done we don't want to hear why didn't you give your heart to god when i gave you an opportunity on a saturday about 2 30 in the afternoon and i give you an opportunity to fall more and look why didn't you do it well i was just waiting for another i was waiting for the right time there's no better time than now [Applause] run why he's open to you amen amen you know he said they're getting given into the devices of the devil first second corinthians 2 and verse 11 said lest satan should get an advantage over us for we are not ignorant of his devices and boy doesn't he have some devices today i guarantee you every one of you got a device in your pocket yeah over the timber they don't get on that please [Music] you know when i was a kid i had to go look for sin that's right i had to go look i'm just going to say it out open i know some parents get offended by it but they need to open their eyes and see what the devil's doing i had to go look for pornography now you don't have to look for it it's right in your that's pocket that's the truth it's there calling at you that siren song know what i'm talking about those sailors would go by and there would be those beautiful women singing over there and they knew if they would give into it they was going to die that's exactly what is happening amen in our phones and things and i you know i'm guilty as anybody spending too much time but we need to be really careful the time we give those things well it was for business is for this or that and some of those things are needful and we live in the age that those things are and but you got to be careful with them because they're devices they're ways that satan can enter into your mind and and i can't tell you how many young people we've prayed for that had visible manifestations of demons and you'd get and those demons would leave and as we heard last night it wasn't just one there's been many and you talk to them later it's like where did you pick this up where did this come from and almost every one of them would say from pornography boy or girl it's a rampant problem it's running rampant in our our young people and not just our young people it's running rampant in our churches and the older ones and everybody else why because it's so accessible the devil has made sin so accessible you don't have to go look for it you don't have to go down the street and buy a magazine no more you don't have to go it is there right before you [Applause] if there ever was a time that you need a real birth it's now if there ever was a time that you needed a real moment with jesus it's right now [Applause] amen let's go wait for another service let's go wait for another moment if you need him you need him right now i'm going to tell you when you're getting those prayer lines and places and you see those manifestations of the devil my young son andrew amen he said he said one thing it done for me he said i saw that and them demons come out and i saw those faces changed i saw i heard him speak i saw that the devil was real he said but not only did i see that the devil was real i saw god was real hallelujah amen i believe the devil tries to set traps and he tries to do things and it always backfires on him i hope this morning you can find out one thing god is real a real god with a real message with a real purpose and he has a purpose for your life you're not here by [Applause] accident well you don't know brother timothy my family didn't even plan my coming there it just happened god planned it [Applause] they may not have planned it but god planned it god put it there god placed it there god placed you here listen do you know how many i i can't even count the odds of being born in a home that believes a message could have been born in a million billion different homes at a million billion different times but god chose to put you here amen and not only did he choose to put you here he would watch over your fathers and grandfathers great grandfathers all he would watch over them through wars and watch over them through wrecks and watch over because there was a seed that had to come through he was zealous over you he was watching over you he was preparing for you he wanted you oh hallelujah if you can get that revelation god wants me he desires me he wants me he wants my fellowship he wants my love he wants my abilities he wants everything i have [Applause] there's so many devices satan's devices as i said it gets you by yourself and makes you think nobody else cares about you nobody understands and nobody's worried about your situation everybody's laughing everybody's making fun and meanwhile everybody's praying for you but that's not what the devil wants you to know he wants you to make you think when somebody looks at you and turns away he wants to make you think at that moment oh i knew they had a problem with me no they just all of a sudden thought of something else and needed to go take care of something had nothing to do with you that's the devil's device and i know with young people we want to be accepted come on now be honest we want to be accepted we want to want to be loved and cared for and thought of and we desire that won't we want approval and sometimes parents don't give it they don't ever give that because somehow some reason there's a problem there and they can't show the real love they ought to show as a father and mother or whatever grandmothers whatever they can't they can't show that sometimes and it causes a problem on the inside of that child because they never heard i love you they never heard amen a real had to hug or had a moment where they never had those moments and it causes a thirst and a hunger and the first thing you know the devil enters in and he starts turning that towards the wrong things [Applause] and they're chasing after this approval and that approval and they get it and they got to go to somewhere else to get another approved one they get it they got to go somewhere else they're never satisfied because there is a longing there but if they could ever take a third or take a drink amen from the well of god that thirst has been on the inside of you you thought you was thirsty for drugs you thought you was thirsty amen for a woman you thought you was thirsty for this that and the other no what you really been thirsty for is a drink from the eternal well of almighty god if you could ever get a drink amen oh taste and see that the lord is good and his mercy endureth forever he wants to fulfill every desire of your heart [Applause] amen one time in the scripture after the death of ahab one of israel's most wicked kings his son hezekiah followed him on the throne he have one of the most wicked but his son has hezekiah one day he was walking in his upper porch and he fell through lattice and he hurt himself and he took some sort of disease and then he called two of his men and sent them over to ekron to the god of bells above to consult his prophets was he going to recover or not and elijah the tishbite being a true prophet of god the holy spirit came to envision said go stand in the way he said see god will block your way now listen to statement it's not easy to go to hell it's hard to go to hell oh man well i thought straight i thought wide was the way prophet god said it's not easy he said god will try to block you every part he'll try to stop you he'll try to turn you he'll try to be there he'll send a preacher your way he'll send this one that one he'll do whatever it takes amen god sends his messengers he sends prophets he sent his gospel he makes his church a flaming fire and men constantly fight right over he sends it out on the waves or the radio or television he sends the published word he sends it from lip to ear and men are constantly walked right over it he said but god sends it anyhow why would you go to echoing the bells above when because there's no prophet in israel is there no god there that's the reason people today go deliberately to drunken parties and dances at night gamble cheat try to make a lot of money is it because is it because there's no pleasure in god wow is it because there's no no pleasure in god and the very reason that you thirst for that is because you are rejecting god god made a man to thirst but to thirst after him but after you turn that down the devil tries to satisfy that thirst with drinking or smoking or gambling or things on your phone it's because we haven't got a holy spirit is it because we ain't got a holy spirit that brings joy it's is it because that there's no satisfaction it's christ is it in christ that you seek those things is that why you're going after it but i'm telling you there is satisfaction in christ there is joy unspeakable and full of glory hallelujah this joy can be given to you i've got a joy that the world didn't give and the wall can't take away hallelujah i got a word that the world didn't give and the world can't take away [Applause] hallelujah i wonder how many young people will say i got something that the devil didn't give and for the devil can't take it away [Applause] hallelujah is it because that there's not something there is there no pleasure in serving christ is that the reason men do what they do he said why they would continually drink and then go to church for recovering have you never tasted the lord yet you've never known how good he is if a man ever come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins plunged beneath that swirl plunged beneath that the sins of the world and all the devil could offer would be as dead as midnight it's because they refuse to do it is because they refuse to receive the holy spirit god's bomb it reminds me of a man dying on the doctor's doorsteps a man die because he refused to take the remedy for his disease if the doctor's got a remedy for your disease and you say i won't take it you could sit on his doorstep close to it and you'd still die because you refused to remedy don't then don't lay it on the doctor he's got the remedy you need to lay it on your stubbornness not to receive it it wasn't because there wasn't no god in israel it wasn't because there wasn't no prophet there it was because the king was too stubborn he hated the prophet he said that's what's the matter with today there's no there's satisfaction there's healing for soul body and christ but the people are too stubborn that's right amen well brother timothy i wanted to shout in service well we're getting there that's the reason they die in their sins on the church steps sitting right on church pews it wasn't because there wasn't a remedy it was given every service come yet to the lord come and seek him come and find him and it was pleading and pleading and pleading you know we like i said we had goats goat we get sick my dad was almost as he was really the vet would have to call him sometimes to see what to do for a goat he was pretty well well versed in taking care of goats and uh some some of the preachers started giving him a hard time about that said well i said preachers have goats and he said i figure every preacher has pastored a few goats but you know you'd see a goat sick and you would so would kind of kind of look at it and say well his ears are dropped drooping down it's kind of hunched over is he's got he needs a needs a dose of this or that and you go draw it up in the medicine and pull it up in a syringe or he's going to give it a shot or sometimes you put it down their throat and you know what that goat didn't have a choice he'd go out there and he'd say hey son i need you to give that one a shot it's got this and i need you to do this i'd walk over there and i'd grab that goat and i'd either put his head between my leg whatever i had to do give it to them open their mouth pull it up and give it down their throat that goat didn't have a choice that's the difference between you and a goat the pastor can see that you're sick they can see when things ain't going good you say well i'm okay well you're not you might hide it as me and might hide it from your mom and daddy but you're not ever hiding it from the spirit of almighty god god will anoint a man and he'll show him things and he'll show that there's sicknesses inside of you and he'll begin to study on something and begin to preach and it will play it all out there but the choice is he can't come over there and grab you around the throat and say take it no you have to take it for yourself you have to say god that is me i see myself there and i'm going to accept that remedy so i don't have to die of this disease amen there is a disease that's going out through the land and it's worse than kobe had ever thought about being it's a layover seeing flu and it's killing people by the thousands why not because there wasn't no remedy there is a holy ghost that'll put it up put them above laodicea and above the things of the world and above all the things are going on but they refuse it pleasures of sin are for a season it's only for a moment wow if i could just marry that girl it's only for a moment or if i could just get that job it's only for a moment oh if i could just do that it's only for a moment you may live in the best house you might drive the best fleet of cadillacs or camaros or whatever cars are out there you might be the most popular you might be the king of the party the life and the fun of your group but you'll never be satisfied until you tasted god's eternal life by the holy spirit that's god's toxin that's the only thing that'll work that's the only one thing see he said the number one killer in the land is not heart disease as we're told the number one killer is sin disease the disease of sin is killing the world he said i often made this statement it isn't the robin that pecks the apple that kills the apple it's the worm in the core that kills the apple it isn't communism that's killing america it isn't other nations that's polluting this nation it's the sin in the nation that's polluting itself it's the immorals of the people and thousands those are called christian binary and the world sees them no different in them than any other person therefore christianity has become so weak you talk to anybody i'm a christian what do you mean i'm a christian talk to a man you know smoking a cigarette and you ask them don't you think there's at all you know i believe that when are you ready for the rapture oh yeah i'm ready for the rapture just any day i'm gonna go he said when that rapture comes i'm gonna throw this cigarette down and i'm gonna go in the rapture everybody's a christian because christianity has become so weak people have begun to real not even realize anymore as the boy we read in the bible they're naked and they don't even know it their minds have become so overcome by spirits they can walk out before you naked brother brahma said it's going to get so bad and it's becoming more and more prevalent and it's becoming more and more prevalent in our churches and and and things and dresses and not listen it ain't just girls it's boys too listen it ain't just girls that needs to hold a standard it's boys too but now we got it where it's cool for a boy to go get a perm and get curly hair what that that's becoming a that's not cool that's becoming styles of the world where'd you pick it up at you know i had a boy one time that was asking me about wearing shorts i had a wrong wear shorts i can go through all the quotes i can do this and i can do that ain't wrong wearing shorts he said what do you think about it i said well why are you asking me you already got your mind made up that's what my thoughts were but i thought you know i'll i'll pray about it and i'll come talk to you so i went in prayer about it and i was like you know he gave me all of his the whole list of quotes he had found and he had his all of his reasonings of how it used to be shorts were up here and now they're down here and all this kind of stuff and and i i just went and started praying about it and he had made this statement he said i just think you wouldn't maybe think that this was just brother branham's opinion i was like man i get i get you get on some very treacherous grounds when you go down that ray road so i'm praying about it and i ask god what kind of answer can i give this boy lord what can i or this young man what can i do what where what where can i what what can i say i i don't even know and all of a sudden it's dropped in my heart said if it's just his opinion ask him what influenced that opinion i got to thinking about it could it be that what influenced if you want to just call the things these kind of things are the message just brother branham's opinion could it be amen that it was the angel of god that visited him night after night that might have had an influence on what just his opinion therefore if that's so what and you have a different opinion let me ask you the question what's influence in your opinion [Applause] is it hollywood is it things you're looking at is it pads and fashions of the world what is influencing what you do [Applause] the zeal of my father's house he wants a clean vessel he wants clean hearts he don't want just a a law or just going through the motions listen young people we need to be more than just going through the motions [Applause] amen more than just showing up and clapping our hands and raising amen that's what i used to do my whole life i sit on the front pew right there and i would raise my hand but just as sinful as i could be but one day god came on the scene for me and i met him personally for myself and that same god is here this morning [Applause] and he's got a remedy he's got a remedy but will you take it he's got a remedy for your issues your depression he's got a remedy for it your anxieties and your fears he's got a remedy for it you're never feeling worthy enough he's got a remedy for it you never feel in love he's got a remedy for it you never feeling that you'll ever make it he's got a remedy for it hallelujah the zeal of my father's house is it not because is it because there's not a bomb no it's because people refuse to take it the devil's there trying every kind of way to tear you down trying to tear at you i've talked to more young people that has false suicidal spirits in these last couple years some of them even taken their life that suicidal spirit is one of the most selfish spirits there ever was makes you turn so inward to all you can think about is yourself and you don't realize the pain and the suffering you're gonna cause when you take your life the mom and the dad that's gonna cry buckets of tears and churches church is gonna be tore up because of the situation and we no it's all about me there's a remedy for that there's a peace that passes all understanding there's a joy that can come into your heart and set you free from all those things listen we don't come to church to occupy a pew we don't come to church to just hear a good sermon or to hear good music they all got their place but we better come to church what we come to church for is to check up with god and our soul salvation for the day of redemption is near jesus christ's son liking this he said to a woman and he said a woman had lost her coin on her tablet that would they used to wear a ring of coins around their head and they signify different things virtue and all kinds of things and one day she lost a coin and he said she became so zealous to find it because her husband was returning and she was going
