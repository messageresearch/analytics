to be here another year for a youth service for special meetings this has been a special part of the year every year I feel like in the special meetings that would come this little song is come on my heart that I I just I don't even know it very well so if I mess it up forgive me but it struck me last night in the service as well as the brother was preaching that I don't know if I have a full revelation of something that we recognize that we are forgiven of our sins I can look at my own life and see my past and it's almost like I recognize God forgive my sins but do I truly recognize that he forgot them that it's actually it's not that he just looks at and says I know and I forgive you but it's actually gone I don't think I even fully catch a picture of that it's my past is actually gone but may we catch more of a picture it happened so long ago and I cried out for Mercy back then I bet the blood of Jesus begged him to forgive my sin but I still can't forget it it just won't go away so I wept again Lord wash my sin but this is all he said what's in [Music] what's in that's as far away as the East is from the West oh what's in [Music] what's in it was gone the very minute you can fast buried in the sea of forgetfulness [Music] yeah the heaviest thing you'll carry is a lord of guilt and shame you were never meant to Bear them so let them go in Jesus name our God is slow to anger quick to forgive our sins to put it under the blood and don't bring them up again and you'll hear him saying foreign [Music] buried in the sea of forgetfulness what's in it [Music] Watson well that's as far away as the East is from the West oh Watson Watson it was gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea get for now [Music] [Applause] man let's all stand but saying thank you Jesus for all the things that you have done for us thank you [Music] Jesus Oh for the things that you have done for us oh I can't repeat prove that you have given me yet thank you Lord oh thank you Jesus for the things that you have done for us no I can't repay of that you have given me I I think you know [Laughter] [Music] thanks thanks I give you things for all you 've done I am so blessed oh my

you looking forward to it amen that means there's an expectation that the words that you're singing are yea and amen it's not a hope so we don't hope we have faith we know that soon and very soon we're going to see the king because he's done something in me that's changed me and it is changing me from Glory unto glory amen oh isn't he wonderful he's been so good to us this weekend and I'm always excited for this meeting in particular because I get to be gathered together with all the young people and there's so much energy in it and so much Youth and just love for the Lord and I see an each and every one of you that you're here because you want to be here you're here because something's drawing you it says nobody else has to come just the young people have to come we could have been out playing volleyball we could have been out doing something else but there's something greater amen and we're not just gathered at end time message Tabernacle we're gathered together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this afternoon amen if you're not there you're going to be there soon amen amen it's so good to have you together it's up to you it's up to you now Christ is going to do his part he's here he never fails he never disappoints but he said will I find faith when I come in other words he's here right now looking on the hearts of young people saying will you believe I'm speaking here he's here to speak my word will you believe that's what he's asking for you if you believe all things are possible to them that belief amen I trust you came with that confession this afternoon I believe that God is here to do all things because he said my sheep know my voice a stranger they will not follow and he says I will give unto them eternal life Hallelujah we're going to see the king amen why don't we just sing a short song as we invite brother Nathan to come I don't want to take any of his time set your wings on the Winds of faith you can fly in a higher place this

people it's really really an honor for me to be with you and have sure appreciated the fellowship here with you this weekend we're new faces to one another but uh you just have have uh whether you know it or not captured my heart and I do want to bring you greetings from our youth group back home brother Ronnie long who's ministered this meeting before and I we we help with the youth ministry at home at True Word Tabernacle there in Ohio and if you're ever able to come visit us you'll make some real good friends we got some wonderful young people there some of you I think that are here are are coming to our youth camp in about two weeks and uh and we're just really looking forward to having you and I love the young people this message this message uh produced as the finest young people on the face of the Earth and I want to I want to just commend you for your stand and for your testimony and and if you only knew how much you you impress uh those that have come before you because your generation has a quality you have a Zeal you have a you have a passion for this message you didn't see it in my generation you didn't we didn't see it among our peers brother Andrew but God Amen this message has not diminished over time amen but this revival has grown it is Advanced and you're a part of it young people nobody can take your place amen you're here this is your moment this is your time not just this service but this season this age this era amen with this word uh you're indispensable to God Amen and as we Minister uh this afternoon I hope that that will become something a little more clearer to you by the help of the Lord let's turn to First Corinthians the 12th chapter and verse 18. amen and this is a little bit of part two uh to to Thursday evening and um I'd like to title it God's economy God's economy maybe a phrase that you've heard before but whether you know it or not you're a part of God's economy First Corinthians chapter 12 will start at verse 18. the Bible says but now have God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member then where were the body in other words if we were all an eye if we were all if we were all a hand if we were all afoot it wouldn't be much of a body would it amen if the whole body was an eye where were the hearing and if the whole we're hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased who him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our company parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that parchment which lacked that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another amen what a beautiful what a beautiful type there could we also take Ephesians chapter 3 before we pray and have you seated and here's where I'm going to take my text Ephesians 3 verses 8 and 9. I'll try not to keep you long today I try to preach the message of the hour not the message of the hour and a half or you know so we want to respect your time and and make make sure we have plenty energy for the service this evening but how many want to take advantage of this time amen this is the one service this weekend that's specifically for you as young people let's take advantage of it Ephesians chapter 3 verses 8 and 9 he says unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created All Things by Christ by Jesus Christ we were preaching Thursday on this mystery this mystery God having these secret attributes in his thoughts before the foundation of the world and you were one of those thoughts but now we're having Fellowship Paul says with the mystery and that Fellowship uh it is sometimes translated as economy and because it's an interchange it's an interaction it's a group thing amen and so that's where we get this phrase God's economy that we've heard before it comes from this scripture amen can we have a word of Prayer and let me just ask you if you'd just be uh willing to make known if you have a very I mean specific this afternoon something specific in your heart something a real a need amen an exact and a specific need something that uh something you're looking for to gain out of this service would you raise it to him as we pray amen be intent be and be specific Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the Revelation that we have in this day of this mystery Lord and just to realize that we all have a part in this thing Lord there's no big eyes and little use Lord in the kingdom of God but we are all a part of your economy Lord and these young people that are gathered before me Lord many of them because of the complexes of Youth Lord because of the things that the our society is projected onto them Lord and the environment that they're raised up in Lord and the persecution of the church Lord all these different factors Lord there are many people like young people Lord that are gathered here to this afternoon and Lord that do not recognize how valuable they are to you Lord and when I look at these young people Lord my heart just swells because they mean so much to me Lord and in my eyes they have such value in my eyes they have such potential Lord but Lord that that couldn't touch Lord what they are to you father when you look at them you see your children Lord you don't just see a young man you don't just see a young woman you don't see somebody lesser or inferior Lord but you see somebody that you predestinated in yourself before the foundation of the world and you Rose them up Lord for a very special purpose in this day and Lord as we would just labor to preach your word father I'm just trusting in your anointing Lord you would help Lord and may we all get out of the way father so you could say exactly what you want to say to these young people and Lord may it be edifying I pray and may we have your leadership Lord may you just move in a special way amongst us Lord you would change lives change attitudes Lord and change the narrative Lord in each heart I pray in the name of Jesus Christ we just dedicate ourselves to you amen God bless you as you're seated today amen preaching about the Fellowship of the mystery the economy of the mystery and you know if you miss Thursday and that's all right if you if you if you don't have the recap here but uh but we were preaching a little bit about how brother Brown taught on God and morphe which means god expressing himself through a form like a mask and and this is how God works as he is down Through the Ages he God never changes he the way that he thinks and the you know his his heart his his thoughts they never change but yet he changes his mask from time to time and season and to season so that he can reveal more about himself because he desires that God actually wants that God wants to reveal himself amen not just to churches and peoples and Nations those times have come and they've gone but today brother Bram said the message is to an individual and so so so you know if you couldn't uh if you weren't there Thursday or or maybe you can't wrap your mind around it but the core of the message that that I just want to set here as the foundation is that God desires a personal fellowship with you God desires to reveal himself not just to your pastor not just to your parents not just to your fellow church members or your church as a body but God desires young people in this day in this year in this time amen that he can reveal himself to personally amen and then by that Revelation they could know who he is and he could come a little lower than he was yesterday to step into the life of a young man or step into the life of a young woman and make you his mask for this day amen so he can reveal something about the mystery within himself amen of which you are apart you are a part of the mystery of God brother Brown said before the foundation of the world he thought about you and if he thought about you then amen then he thought about you always for eternity because God is eternal and his thoughts are Eternal and so if you have a part in him amen you're never in danger of losing it amen nobody will ever pluck you out of his hand because as you belong to him amen you are important you you have a value to him and so and so we have a fellowship with this mystery this mystery that I'm talking about is the mystery of God but it's being revealed amen it was revealed in Jesus Christ but it's also revealed in your personal individual life amen and so you as a mask for this word you're giving life to the mysterious purpose that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world you say me brother Nathan you are giving life to the mystery to the purpose to what he had in his heart before the foundation of the world you have to do with it you're a part of it you're a part of God's economy and that makes you as an individual now as a church you're very important to us because of the ministry of brother Ed and and the precious families that are here and the legacy of brother Harold you're important to us as a church back there in Ohio but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about you as an individual amen whatever church that you belong to wherever you've come from whatever family you were raised up in you are very special you are very important because this mystery is an economy amen and you you know what an economy is we live in an economy it's a it's part of human nature to have you know economy where there's trade and there's interaction and you know you don't just live in your house and and eat everything that grows up in your backyard and you know you know you didn't you didn't build your own car out of the iron that was in your soil there's got to be an economy right amen somebody's got to provide the iron somebody's got to provide the food and somebody's got to provide the services somebody's got to provide the work and the labor everybody's got to provide amen and the only way you could survive you can't even live in this world without taking part in the economy right amen so what I want to what I want to preach you in God's economy is is to make you think about it this way participation is not an option it is not an option you don't get to sit in your hands amen and just just be a consumer amen and just have everything come to you amen the world that we live in in the naturally speaking it's an economy you have to participate amen but in God's economy it's the same brother sister spiritually speaking you don't get to just come to this message and just be a church member and just warm up you and just just sit there and and consume and take everything in but God has called you even as a young person even in this season of your life amen God has raised you up to take part in the economy of the revelation of the mystery of God amen you're very very important the thing doesn't run without you Hallelujah participation is not an option amen you got to realize who you are brother Branham said you you somebody say me somebody say I I was a son or daughter of God before there even was a moon stars or a molecule you believe that about yourself that's what a prophet said you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that were in God at the beginning amen for there's only one form of eternal life and he said that was you before amen I love that word before because you know we go through things as young people and we get into circumstances of our life and you know we get to we have a certain spiritual temperature and we've got struggles we've got problems and and it's hard to get our minds out of the moment but brother Bram said don't look at the moment but think about before amen because before you ever made a mistake before you ever fail in a snare before you ever ran into trouble you are a son you are a daughter of God you're older than the molecules of this Earth amen you came out of his mind you're The Offspring of Jehovah you're the birthing of his loins amen you young person you young man you young woman are a son or daughter of God an eternal seed your eternal life you were in in the image of God you were made and you were manifested you were manifested you were manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God Amen and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world brother bran says right he says no way around it come on young people there's no way around this thing amen you might spend like I did you might spend about 20 years being raised up in a message Church you might have come out of a message family maybe your grandpa's a pastor maybe your daddy's a deacon your mom's a Church musician and you got you got that kind of a yeah of a pedigree amen but that doesn't do you any good in God's economy amen because there hasn't come a day there's no way around it there's no substitute for it you got to come to a personal experience a personal revelation of Jesus Christ not to your church not to your family to you as an individual amen you got to know where you stand with God you got to know that you were in his mind before the foundation of the world God wants to reveal that to you amen if that's something you desire it's not withheld from you it's what God is trying to get across to young people in this day amen God doesn't have any grandchildren he's looking for a young man or a young woman to rise up and say I'll be a part of God's economy I'll be part of the fellowship of this mystery there's no way around it friends if you were in the mind of God you have to be a part of the unveiling you got to be a part of the word for this day you've got to be part of this Revelation you've got to be part of this you have to be because see the seventh angel message reveals the whole mystery the whole mystery when we talk about the the whole mystery of God being revealed we're not just talking about the Seven Seals and the church ages and the third poll amen and water baptism and the revelation of the godhead and all those things I'm talking about individuals amen it's got to be revealed friends and that's exactly where we're living as we're preaching on Thursday it's the big reveal amen this great drama has come to a crescendo it's come to the very climax of this story and God has taken his mask off amen and showed hey this is not just a church this is not just a denominational system this is not just a social Gathering amen this is Christ revealing himself Amen in a many-member bride and that means that means older ones that means mothers and fathers and ministers and pastors but that means young men and young women with lives that are burning with this message burning with the Zeal of this word saying nobody can take my part amen don't let anybody despise my youth I'm part of this mystery I'm part of this message nobody can take your place friends amen that's what I that's all I'm trying to tell you this afternoon amen every single attribute under this message under this seventh angel sounding every attribute has to be revealed everything has to be expressed this is Harvest Time manifesting time everything has to put forth fruit and prove what it is one way or the other friends there's no way around it you you it's going to be revealed out of your life what seed is in you 've got a part in this thing Hallelujah brother Bram said the lamb he talks about the lamb and the time of intercession amen the lamb how Jesus died you ever wonder why well Jesus died and he paid for all of our sins so what are we doing here 2000 years later what's the whole thing about why are we here he paid he came and he paid for our sins you know and he paid the price of Redemption how come we didn't all just go to heaven then because there was more mystery there was more attributes there were more things in his heart that had to be revealed and so he's laying there in a part of an intercessor he's on that Mercy Seat pleading out amen and he says as long he said the reason why is that he knew that there were names in there that were put there before the foundation of the world now you got to put your name here brother sister he said and as long as those names have never been manifested on Earth as yet he had to stay there as an intercessor a glory to God friends amen he couldn't we he couldn't take everybody to Heaven two thousand years ago the Rapture couldn't come in 1977 why because there was another name on the book amen and the blood of Jesus Christ is in effect generation after generation it's never too late as long as there's a name on his book amen he won't lose a one of them he won't lose you he'll find you he'll Quicken you he'll bring you into the fold Hallelujah he won't fail to do it brother Graham said as long as there was one name for the sake of one name amen that had never been declared in the earth Christ had to stay as an intercessor to take care of that name friends there's no way around it I'm here to tell you you can't be halfway into this message you can't ride the fence with this message amen you've got to manifest what you are but if you're one of his children don't worry about anything he'll watch over your name if you're on his book young man young woman you don't have to fear you don't have to be afraid just trust the seed as brother Ron preached trust that seed it's going to manifest itself he'll watch over his that name he'll watch over your name why because it's his name it's his reputation amen what kind of a Good Shepherd would he be if he could lose one of his Sheep amen the problem we have as young people we have far too much fear about where we stand with God and what I'm trying to preach to you amen is that God didn't choose you on the basis of what a good Christian life that you live amen how good a boy or how good a girl that you've been amen is not what earned you into his presence amen you didn't work your way into this thing you weren't taught into this thing amen you didn't study your way into this thing amen but it was the grace of God that elected you amen he looked at you amen and he chose you amen he chose other people but he chose you on that same level he said this one amen this name is going on my book and nobody will ever take it off Hallelujah he's taking care of your name this is not this message is not just about don't let don't be deceived young people amen this thing isn't just about joining a good message Church you go to a good message church here here in Edmonton you you have a good pastor amen you got good family you got good Ministry you got you got good leadership amen but that but it's more than that friends it's not about having your name on the book amen but it's by knowing by a personal revelation that your name's on his book Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost has sent amen it's a token unto you amen that's why you got to be born again you got to have the Holy Ghost on the inside where his Spirit Bears witness with your spirit that says I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God my name is on his book if that's not a reality to you it can be it can be you don't have to leave this meeting this afternoon amen without a solid sure personal revelation that you are a son or a daughter of God with eternal security Hallelujah you got to have a revelation that your name's on his book hey man because if your name's on the book of of end time message Tabernacle that only goes so far amen and it ain't far enough it's not enough for me to know that I belong to true or Tabernacle and you know and and and I've sat under the ministry of Ray Erickson and Dwayne Lawson and I thank God for those things and God works through those things but my security amen my identity is not on the name of my church amen who are being associated with the name of William Branham you realize there's only one name given under Heaven whereby men may be saved amen and that's the name that he's watching over that's the name whose reputation he will defend amen is fear one of his if you're in Jesus Christ then you're called by his name amen you're identified with his attributes if he's righteous you're righteous if he's holy you're holy if he's good you're good if he's got power you've got power if he's an overcomer you're an overcomer not because of who you are or who you belong to but because you're part of him Hallelujah you're in God's economy amen a word what is a word it's a thought that has become expressed amen and we talk a lot you you've heard good teaching you've heard good Ministry and we talk a lot around this message about the word and the word the word we've got the word we believe the word amen God restored the word amen but what is the word friends amen it's got to be a little deeper than that you've got to realize you are the word amen because you were the thought of God that now has been expressed making you the spoken word of God Amen God didn't send a messenger to raise up a bunch of churches and build a new denomination but he sent a be sent an eagle screaming over a chicken yard amen so that somebody amen of a royal seed of a royal lineage somebody that belonged to him in the beginning would hear that prophet's voice and say that's my father's voice that's not just a words of a man amen Hallelujah I don't know what you think this message is young people maybe it's the lifestyle that you were raised under amen it's the tradition of your home it's the church that you belong to it's more than that it's a whole lot more than that there's deeper things in here for you than that amen that won't keep you that won't hold you that won't even give you peace it won't even give you Joy all you'll find in that level of thinking is a bunch of miserable religion amen but if you could ever hear this Eagle scream amen if you could ever hear your theophany speak to you out of this message amen it'll rock your world Amen it'll be a deep call that'll answer the deepest desire of your heart and will identify you say you're my child you came from me you matter you're important you're special you have value because you're part of my mystery and I have thought of you but now I have spoken to you and I have expressed into this age a group of young people amen that are called to overcome laodicea amen and take the very changing of the body notice brother bran said the word had to be manifested if you're if you were a thought you've got to become word you've got to become manifested Who You Are and when the word had to be manifested of a promise he said God always sends a prophet to manifest that promise because the word of the Lord comes to him right the word of the Lord comes to a prophet Moses was foreign for the purpose he was called to the job and no one else could do it no one else could do it and when God has called a person for a job to do there's no one that can take his or her place there is no one when God has called somebody there is nobody that can take their place now you're going to have to we hear these things a lot as young people but you got to really just let it settle in for a moment that there's nobody who can take my place God called me amen and I'm not interchangeable I am not dispensable I am not replaceable I am part of his purpose I am part of him Amen brother Brown said there is no one that can take your place amen there's no one that can take your place I like how he said it with your peculiarity now we're all peculiar people some of us more than others amen but see God God made you the way that you are in a peculiar way in a unique way on purpose it was on purpose oh my amen let's just read on he said there's no one could take your place with your peculiarity now brother man just begins to share personally from his own heart he says there's how often I've wondered he said I would have liked to take Oral Roberts place amen I would have liked to take Billy Graham's place or be somebody like that but he said I can't be Billy Graham but neither can Billy Graham be me I can't be Oral Roberts but Oral Roberts can't be me amen amen are you getting any young people he said you are each one set in God's economy just for its place one fast all the time and communes with God and another one casts out Devils amen because this one is fasting remember somebody came to brother Branham and they said brother Branham I've been fasting and I've been praying and I've been I've been putting in a lot of work I've been really making a lot of sacrifice and I still never cast out a devil you know so what's wrong with me because because what's happening in my life is not what's happening in your life brother Brandon brother Branham said you got it all wrong he said you're supposed to fast and pray so I can cast out the devils hey man so see see in God's economy you can't measure Yourself by somebody else amen you can't expect God to reveal something in your life that he's just just because it's being revealed in somebody else that's not why he raised you up amen if God needed another Nathan Erickson he already raised up on Nathan Erickson he already raised up an Andrew Dodd he already raised these ones up amen he doesn't need another Nathan he doesn't need another Andrew but he needs you he needs you amen because your peculiarity fits the very need that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world amen it's the whole body of Christ working together the unity the unity brother sister you are an authentic you are a one of a kind work a creation of God's expression you think you think well Nathan I'm not really anything special oh yes you are amen because the great artist of creation the one who painted every rainbow the one who painted the sunset amen the one who dotted the Stars up in the heavens amen as brother Ron preached he watched over your grandfather and your grandmother and every ancestor that you had and everything that ever happened in your life and everything that you've been through was God with the paintbrush of the artist amen painting you amen expressing you building you into what he wanted for his purpose for his glory for his for the need that he wanted to meet through your life through your life amen you got to accept that for yourself amen he does and here's the beautiful thing about God God doesn't do anything halfway brother bam said God doesn't make halfway Christians he doesn't make halfway preachers sometimes a preacher's halfway but God doesn't make halfway preachers halfway Christians halfway young people he doesn't do anything haphazard he makes all things beautiful in his time amen so you got to believe that about yourself amen that don't sell yourself short amen don't let the devil amen assign his value to you amen trust God's evaluation of you amen he said you're precious you're accepted in the Beloved you're a part of me you are my creation you are my word I thought about you I meditated over you I spoke you I expressed you I painted you I sculpted you I formed you to reveal my mystery to make you part of my great drama I gave you purpose I gave you life I gave you breath Hallelujah brother Graham said it he said your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and think of this now he said the color hair that you have it comes down pretty real right the color hair you have some of you would change your hair color if you could some of you would change the color of your eyes but brother bran said the color of eyes that you have amen the stature that you're in some of you would add an inch some of you would give one up amen but the stature that you're in God's seen you before the foundation of the world and now you know it was so wonderful hearing brother Ron preached last night because I grew up I've heard over Decades of my life amen I've heard brother Ron preach that the God chose the color of your hair God chose I've heard him preach that quote so many times as a young person but you know what it took me a little while to believe it amen but what I want to tell you young people is that you got a right to lay hold of that in the face of every complex that you have everything you would change about yourself all that insecurity all those thoughts of insufficiency friends you are allowed to lay that aside and take hold of God's predestination and say I oh friends you realize that a Christian doesn't a Christian doesn't love himself love herself it's not Christian to love yourself but let me tell you something to encourage you amen as a Christian when you get a revelation of your predestination you can love being yourself you can love being who God made you to be friends amen amen I admire I admire brother Ron I admire Brother Ray those are my heroes amen but you know what I like being Nathan Erickson and I like doing what I was called to do and I like being me I didn't used to think that way as a young person but God gave me a revelation that I've got a part in God's economy and nobody 's can feel it [Applause] else can do what I'm called to do nobody can do what you're called to do God never thought he never thought up a backup plan for you he didn't have a few different concepts that he could run with if you didn't work out you are a perfect for ordained creation of God you are predestinated unto adoption you are possessed what is adoption it's a positional placing you're predestined to fill a spot in this Tabernacle in this Temple of restored worship you're one of those stones in that wall and you might wish you were shaped a little different you might wish you looked a little different you were painted a different color but friends if you're in this Temple amen then you are housing the glory of God amen you become the vessel you become the container of God's holy presence and anybody in this world who wants to get to God has got to come through you because you are his house you are a stone a Lively Stone that has been built up and you've been placed and you've been shaped in a way that you are shaped and nobody's shaped quite like you nobody can fill your place friends [Music] and listen to this and he saw you a human being just like you are he saw you a human being like you are you mean brother Nathan that God didn't just you know pull out the phone book and just pick off a list of names at random and this one of them just kind of happened to look like me and be like me God saw you you as a human being you as a young man you as a young woman he saw you like you are and he said I choose that one put that name on my book that's the one I want you didn't win God's election by some Lottery of chance he didn't just spin the wheel and you got lucky God chose you he foreknew you he saw you he saw what you would look like he saw what you would be he saw what you would go through me you you not anybody else in this room that I'm preaching to you but you amen uh put that name on my book like we preached on Thursday Christ the Holy Spirit he wants to come into you with your temperament amen you know it's it's kind of easy to see that God would want to come and take over a person and like brother Bram said you know you know he wants to think the thoughts he would think through that person he wants to speak the kind of words he would speak to that person he wants to do the kind of things he would do through that person that's that's you know I mean that's that's that's amazing but that's a little bit easier to wrap our head around amen Until you realize what brother Brown's describing is God wants to do it through your temperaments you say oh brother Nathan of course God can come down on Sunday morning and just take hold of my pastor and anoint his tongue and make him speak the words of life to me amen as the very Oracle of God but I'm telling you brother sister Amen to God with your personality with your preferences with your attitude with your with with he made you the way that you are amen because he wants to express himself through that Hallelujah brother Samuel Browning preach a youth banquet for us one time he said something I wish somebody would have told me this when I was a young person he said listen God wants to give you the Holy Ghost and he wants to give you the Holy Ghost now you might look at it you we got we all have heroes in our life so you might look at brother Andrew and you're 31 brother Andrew and you think my there's a there's a young man who's got the Holy Ghost and you know and and he's got the blessings of the Lord and his life but God doesn't want to give you the Holy Ghost to turn you into a 31 year old he doesn't want to give you the Holy Ghost to make you another Andrew Dodd God God wants to show the world what the Holy Ghost looks like in a 13 year old in a 14 year old in a 15 year old amen he wants to reveal a mystery through you amen and nobody else can do it he wants you he wants you you say brother Nathan I want him I want Jesus I want the Lord I want a real experience he wants that [Applause] is why you feel that pull that's why you feel that draw amen don't look at all the mess that you're in and the things you're dealing with and all the issues you've got right now look way down deep in your heart and you feel that tugging you feel in that pull something pulling on you saying hey I belong to something higher there's a higher a walk for me there's a there's a higher realm amen I've come from somewhere I've fallen from some Glory amen listen to that voice that's God calling you and saying hey amen I I've got this one I've got that one they're in their position they're doing what I called them to do but I've got more mystery I've got more expression to do and I want you to do it I want you to be my instrument I want you to be my paintbrush I want you to be my microphone I want you to be my sculptors tool I want you to be my hammer I want you to be my broom I want you I want you Hallelujah he's in you with your temperament and he begins to talk about in the unveiling of God he talks about you know somebody who like a bell maker you know he takes he takes he takes the minerals of the earth he takes some brass he takes some iron he takes some copper and things like that and he makes a bell amen but you know not every Bell gets the same ingredients or rather it's the same ingredients but it's a different blend it's a different mixture he puts a little more iron in this one and he puts a little more copper in that one amen why because he wants to make it a different sound amen because the great composer knows how to make beautiful music amen so he calls you and he forms you and he doesn't make you the same as everybody else why because you've got a part in this song you got a pardon the art you got a part in this expression now you might be the lead violin amen or or you might be the guy who sits there for two hours and right at the end of the symphony he pulls out the triangle yeah but brother sister if that's who you are you're the only one that can play that thing you're the only one who can make that sound and it wouldn't be a beautiful Symphony without you amen so you got to think a little different you got to think a little bit different than we do with our natural Minds is this okay are you enjoying this amen he said that's the way God did he bred this one to that one and this one and that one amen until he got exactly what he wanted exactly what he wanted now you and me we get up in the morning and look in the mirror and we don't see what we want but I want you to know that God looks through the filter of this word he looks through the blood of Jesus Christ and he sees exactly what he wanted he sees exactly what we wanted God will get what he wants amen I can see God you know before the foundation of the world he says Hey Gabriel come over here come over here and and uh I wanna I wanna just tell you about something I've been I've been thinking I've been thinking and you know I've just been I've just been planning out my great drama and I've been thinking and and I just want to tell you about I tell me about a young man named John and I'm gonna I got this young man John and mine and I'm gonna put him I'm gonna Place him in right there in in Edmonton Alberta and he's gonna have red hair and and he's gonna and he's gonna he's gonna be a singer and a preacher and he's gonna have all these good gifts but you know the great thing about him is that uh he's gonna be a kind of young man when if he can't be preaching he's going to be singing and if he can't be singing he's going to be working and if he can't be working he'll take a broom he'll hold a door for somebody he'll he'll shake a hand he'll smile amen why because he'll be somebody that cares about my work not about his status he's not trying to press himself into being taking somebody else's position he's going to be who I called him to be so he's going to be the all Gabriel he's going to be amazing he's going to be the kind of young man when he walks out of the room his Elders begin to talk about him and brag about him to the visiting preacher amen that's oh and Gabriel begins to say oh my just a what a how to what how to think of that what a Gloria thought Lord amen what a glorious thing that you've thought and God says yes it is glorious Gabriel but wait till I speak it you think it sounds good now you think it's good and worthy to think about but wait till laodicea comes around and I speak it into existence young person God planned you he foreknew you amen he chose you he formed you he loved you before you had existence amen but you did exist in his thoughts in his mind and his choosing wait till I speak it just wait till I speak it can't you see that's a very that's what this message is revealing to us is that cry of God's heart that passion that Zeal of God to say to say oh I can't wait till I get to laodicea amen because there's a group of young people there in the year 2023 amen that I have been waiting all this time I sent preacher after preacher and Prophet after Prophet working my way Amen to you and to you and to you amen I can't wait amen amen to see my bride and full of you oh it's glorious to think about but wait till I speak it wait till I speak it Allelujah and now we're looking around you look at the ones sitting next to you what you're seeing you're seeing the spoken word of God you're seeing things that God thought about before there was a moon before there were stars in the sky amen and God hung every Star in a certain Galaxy to tell your story amen the first Bible he wrote In The Stars the second Bible he wrote with ink and Pen but the third Bible the final voice the final age the final people will be a living breathing epistle written and read of all men and they think you think you think oh you think uh you think that because I'm a preacher maybe I should have the attitude like I'm so glad you young people could come hear me today and have the honor of hearing my sermon friends amen not under the revelation of this message when I look out I think what an honor it is amen what a blessed thing it is to Stand Here Amen in these shoes amen and look out at the purchase of the blood of God Amen and the Very thoughts of God spoken and expressed in this age Amen to have even a glimpse in my heart of what God thinks about you is worth everything to me it is my honor to stand here and talk to you and look at you and see what God has wrought what God has created what God has spoken into this world friends here is thought you are Eternal you are special you are powerful say oh brother Nathan I you know uh uh Power you know that's there's preachers and they lay hands on the sick and they do Miracles and exploits and brother Brown did a lot of Supernatural things but I'm I'm just me I I don't have power brother Brown said that the least little touch of God he said God doesn't have big heavy spots that's powerful and and little weaker spots that are less amen he said the least touch the least touch you say brother Nathan I got a lot less of the of Christ in me than than this one or that one or the one that I'm looking to or the one that preaches to me and I got I'm the least one brother Nathan I'm the least one I'm if I'm part of this body I'm the skin on the bottom of the little toe amen then if you are amen then you're right down there where the action is because you're the closest one to the neck of the enemy and all of hell is under your feet even if you're the least one in his kingdom God Amen the least touch of God brother Bram said is omnipotent not half powerful not sometimes powerful oh powerful omnipotence lays in you deity lays in you amen the reason you don't see it is because you you haven't learned to think in terms of God's economy he said the power you got in you now could make a new world amen and you say oh brother Nathan then how can I how come I can't do it how come because you don't need a new world to live on you're called to overcome this one you're called to put this world under your feet amen we got to get moving he said he's seen something in me and he's seen something in you amen amen he had a reason to save you he said look at the people that are unsafe today look at the millions he could have took besides you but he took you no one can take your place amen you're in God's economy no one can do it he said that's his love for you for you so what you got to do young people and I'd love for you to agree to do this from this time forward is you got to retrain the mind that you were born with to not think in terms of human economy but start to think in terms of God's economy could we take a few moments and deal with that amen you know that we live in a society that is obsessed with value obsessed with value this capitalistic world that we live in amen capitalism is not just you know it's not just something uh like some system that we sort of impose on our on our Humanity it's built into who we are that's why it works well for fallen human beings amen because it it it it exposes our greed it exposes our want our lusts and and our jealousies and all of those things that are in us as human beings and those things are in us because we're built we're falling amen we're in our first birth we are obsessed with value we think in terms of value and a certain kind of value relative value and you know that young people you know that everything every time that you think about your self-worth every time that you measure yourself you're doing it against somebody else amen if I was as pretty as she is if I could sing like he can if I could if I was as handsome as that one if I was as popular as that one amen and and and and you know as young okay you know the oppression you know the the the the the just the heavy weight amen of having that relative value forced down on you and know that you no matter what you do no matter what you achieve no matter how hard you try you'll never measure up the devil will never let you do it this flesh this mind this human Spirit it it doesn't allow us to ever be content it doesn't allow us to ever feel worthy it doesn't allow us to ever feel like we're good enough because of relative value because you're looking at me and saying well maybe well I don't know maybe I'm worth something but I'm not as worth as much as him and I'm not worth as much as her relative value hey man it's actually baked into our human nature you know if you go to school and you take an economics course economics 101 you know they begin to teach you about a barter economy anybody familiar with that you know because and they'll explain it like this they'll say well now we have money and we have value you know we got Canadian dollars in US dollars and they have a certain value amen but they said way back in the day way back sometime somewhere you know they didn't have money yet they hadn't invented it and so so they would barter you know somebody well I got a cow but I need three chickens so I'll trade my cow for your chickens and that's a barter economy you know and we'll just kind of agree on what's equal in value and and that's how it'll work and then eventually they invented money because that made it easier did you know that this is just for whatever it's worth for your interest do you know that in all anthropology and all of history and all that everything that we know from study in humanity nobody could point to a society that ever existed without money nobody knows that it ever this barter economy that's how they teach it but nobody knows of any time it ever happened you know what that tells to me that tells me value is not something we invented it's not just something we came up with one day and it goes way back with the human race it goes all the way back to Eden amen when Adam had something valuable very very valuable eternally valuable but it was lost and deep down on the inside of every human being whether they realize it or not they know that they're Fallen we know that we're unworthy we know we need redeems somebody's got to buy us back because we're not enough we're not worthy we never will be because we lack value amen amen you need Redemption you know that you're lacking value you know that you're never enough you'll never feel like you're enough you'll never feel worthy you'll never feel loved you'll never really be able to just let go and be comfortable in your own skin why because of this value that's imposed on you by your first birth in the economy of this world you will always be compared you will be always come be compared in human eyes you can't escape it you will be compared you will come up lacking but in God's economy and God's economy God does not look at relative value God looks at Eternal value and something is only valuable to God if it was in his mind at the beginning if it's part of his eternal life then it has value and it doesn't have high value or low value or medium value it is value amen because it's Eternal and you are the Eternal seed of God and I don't care how much the devil wants to compare you to somebody else I don't care how much your peers will compare you or how much you'll be asked to measure up to somebody else God doesn't measure You by anybody else he only measures you by the blood of his own son and that's your value Amen in this economy that we have we have things like inflation you know where you got to go down to the supermarket you got to pay twelve dollars for a for for a dozen eggs eggs aren't worth ten dollars it's just something that happened in the economy it was a fluke it was it was some some flawed mechanic something got messed up somewhere and now you got to pay a price for those eggs and the and the eggs aren't worth that but you have to pay the price but in God's that value Amen in God's economy there's no inflation there's no Market manipulation he doesn't mess with the interest rates in God's economy the price is the value I said the price is a value and if God would pay the blood of his only son if God would shed his life then your value is the value of the blood you're the value of his own life that's your value is the price that he was willing to pay God didn't get a poor bargain amen God God didn't get to you know God didn't get ripped off God knew what he was paying and he was willing to pay it for you and the beautiful thing about it is if you were the only one that was ever saved if you were the only one that was ever redeemed if God never redeemed William Branham and and Martin Luther and John Wesley and Nathan Erickson and Andrew Dodd if God if God hadn't redeemed the rest of them and it was just you if it was just you he would have sent his son he would have shed his blood and he would have paid the price just for you because that's how God's economy Works amen because Eternal is infinite it can't be measured it can't be compared it can't be it can't be it can't be comprehended that's how much you mean to God that's how much you mean to God but your mind won't let you think that so you need the mind of Christ to realize it's not robbery to think that way you're allowed to trespass there you're allowed to dare to believe that God loves you and he values you and he chose you and he wanted you amen you're allowed to believe that God wants you to have the Holy Ghost you're allowed to believe that God wants to cover your sins he he wants to deliver you from what you're going through he wants to heal your body he wants to do it because of this eternal value that's in you you see friends I I just hope you can hear the Cry of my heart and my passion as a as a as a as a youth Minister as somebody who loves the young people amen I I love you you are valuable to me you are important to me amen but you you're but but but what I am preaching to you is not some kind of a watered down wishy-washy VeggieTales religion about how you're very special and God loves you very much and it's because why because it's not that I assign you value it's not that I care about you and and I love you in my human love and so I treat you as if you have value you are value you're part of these Eternal mystery you are value and if I stopped loving you and your parents stopped loving you and your pastor stopped loving you and the world rejects you God loves you and you're as valuable you're his butt red ruby you are his bride you're the pure virtuous sinless spotless Bride of the son of God you're him you're called by his name you'll sit in a throne with him you'll judge over Angels you'll judge over multitudes in the valley of decision that's who you are whether you know it or not whether you're ready to accept it or not but the sooner you accept it the sooner you'll lay down all your false humility and all of that human Pride that wants to argue with God about how we're not good enough and how someday we'll someday we'll measure up someday we'll achieve value someday we'll be worthy of being compared amen friends amen that's a that's a that's a that's a game amen that's a that's a path that leads to destruction amen but the way to get onto God's narrow way the way to get on the highway to Holiness amen the path that leads you to a Rapture the path that leads you to heaven amen is when you make up your mind and say God I don't understand it I'm barely willing to accept it I can't wrap my mind around it but I accept your grace I accept your pardon I accept your evaluation I will believe you Lord I am value I am important maybe not to another human being in this world but Lord I'm important to you I'm part of your mystery I'm part of your economy did you think God shed his blood for you because of obligation God shed his blood for you because of Desire because he desired you thought you were Worthy he thought you were acceptable he thought you were redeemable Hallelujah Hallelujah you got to think in terms of God's economy you're not you the world that we live in is not geared to produce that kind of thinking you're biologically not per not you're not you're not built to produce that kind of thinking the only way to be able to think that way is begin to feed on the word of God and hear what he thinks about you let him reveal it to you let him come down into your bedroom or into your car into your closet or or or or or or or wherever he finds you in that quiet moment and let him be he comes he comes he he passes by everybody on your street amen he passed by a lot of churches this afternoon to come and fellowship with us if you feel his presence today he came to you amen amen and and he wanted to and so he begins to whisper his love secrets to you he begins to just tell you hey you realize I love you you realize I'm important you realize when I said there would be an invincible Army you realize when I said there be a selected bride that you're that you're that and you're saying oh Lord no way no way no way kind of rude don't you think laughs when God's pouring out his heart to you and making himself vulnerable humbling himself to reach this out to you and we because of our ideas of value because of our concepts of relativity because of the way because we always want to compare ourselves because we give our complexes the preeminence we want to say no God choose somebody else you got you already got great people you got great leaders you got great men you don't need me brother Branham said sometimes great guys get together and you hear them say oh great so-and-so and great so and so our great brother our great leader he said don't ever do that he said there are no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God Amen he said and you are we are brothers we are sisters he said I don't care if you're pastoring a church it's got five people in it amen that doesn't make you little that makes you a brother you might be the only young person in your youth group that don't make you little it makes you a brother it makes you a sister it makes you part of this thing and in fact you're overcoming things you're overcoming in Realms of loneliness amen that the ones with the big church they don't understand they can't even wrap their minds around it but you know what you're living you're striving you're surviving amen why because you're part of this thing and nobody could take you out of it glory to God you're a brother you are a sister he said he said God doesn't have little children and big children he just has children he said they're all the same he said go notice God himself came down from the ivory palaces of Glory to become one of us now who's the big one he didn't come down here to take the form of a priest but a servant he didn't come and Lord over us he pitched his tent with us he stood at the grave of Lazarus and cried hot tears just to know what you're going through the sympathizing Jesus and what did he do as a servant he washed the very clay that he created he washed the feet of his Apostles and others now who's great you know we think in our terms of value we see big ones in the kingdom of God we see little ones we see those through our human understanding but you've got to realize there's only one rank in the kingdom of God that's foot wash funky if Jesus Christ would leave the Splendor of Heaven and the king of all glory the creator of the universe would would kneel down on the floor and wash the dirty feet of some some foul-mouthed fisherman amen then what then how are you and I going to think anything of ourselves friends amen but praise be to God it was God that thought something of us amen it was his choosing the thought we were valuable it's not who we are it's not big ones and little ones and and and it's not measuring ourselves against people that we think are greater than us it's just to realize I'm part of this I'm a brother I am a sister I'm in this family I'm in this bloodline I'm in this lineage what a glorious thing amen now you know you know of course brother Branham you know because many people would preach what I'm preaching you right now but it comes from a place of jealousy amen it comes from a place of trying to tear down somebody that God's lifted up a Ministry that God has raised up Amen brother Brandon would use he would talk about you know fellow fellow Pentecostal leaders and things and he would say this one you know one of the great ones Among Us or our great brother so and so and he would use terminology like this amen because that's how the body of Christ works you're going to have men that are going to shake the world and you know and preach big conventions and and they're going to be you know and they're going to be in the spotlight maybe more than another one and you're going to have that amen because ye we're not supposed to all be the same we're all different but we're valued the same and God doesn't look at the big name preacher amen and think any more highly of that human flesh than he does of you amen the only way you could possibly believe that is to let go of your ideas of value amen and believe in God's economy hallelujah amen as I've preached before you know we might look at a man like brother Ron Spencer that's traveled the world and he has a Ministry that we all love and and he's dear to us he's important to us and you know many people look and they look through eyes of jealousy at that but you know what you know what it tells me you know as a young Minister you know uh the just the cry my heart think you know what it just hit me one day God loved me so much amen if if you took away my Ministry if I never preached another meaning amen if I had no position in the church if I was nothing in this body not if I couldn't hold the door for somebody if I couldn't even sweep the floor yet God thought so much of me he would raise up Ron Spencer he raised up Ray Erickson he raised up Ed hammermeister amen he raised up your church he raised up my church why because he valued me amen because I was part of his eternity and he had to use those instruments he had to use what we think are great gifts he had to use what we think are small gifts and they all had to work together Amen to bring me into the unity of the faith why because this thing isn't complete without me and it's not complete without you you have value hallelujah hallelujah brother oh my see in God's economy we're all completely different we'll all have different lives different experiences different Ministries but we're all valued the same and there's not another message on the face of the Earth that can reveal that to you like this one brother bran preached adoption anybody ever listened to the adoption series study that remember he said it was a positional placing and so you are called You're predestinated to an adoption which means you've got a position in this thing you've got a place that's reserved for you and nobody else can fill it and only a prophet could preach it now God could have come to a lot down to a lot of men in the in the in the 50s and 60s big charismatic leaders and Pentecostal you know revivalists and and overseers and Bishops and there was a lot of men that God could have come down to and said hey I pick you you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna preach you're gonna preach this people into an adoption age you're going to Usher forth the adoption you're going to bring it to the church you're going to teach it you're going to break it down and you know what it would have been it would have been some guy on TV in the biggest city in the world with a million people around him on the center stage he'd be emptying out hospitals he'd be walking on water he'd be doing the Supernatural and look at the adoption has come to the church look how powerful I am look how big my Ministry is look at my worldwide Outreach there would have been no room for you there would have been no room for me but brother random comes and he preaches adoption he said if God's called you to be a farmer you'll be the best farmer there ever was if God called you to be a mechanic if God called you to be a factory worker if God called you to be a housewife or anything that the world might not value amen but if God calls you to it then it's of Eternal value we don't all have to be prophets we don't have to all be five-fold Ministry amen but we got a part in the body and the Bible said the ones that we think are less honorable on those are bestowed more abundant on her and the ones that you think you can do without you can't you can't you can't have a church without young people you can't have a successful meeting without a without a youth group on fire for the Lord you are the thermometer of the church the best meetings we've ever had in our home church are always right or always the first one after a youth camp a youth meeting or something like that amen I was I was explaining this to our young people you realize why that is you did that that amen because you got you got to a meeting amen where you were valued amen where somebody had a burden for the Youth so they didn't have just a whole weekend of meetings and leave you out they set a place amen where you could be valued and you could be ministered too and so what did it do it gave you a seat at the table and you began to participate amen you get on fire for God then when you show up to church we really have church because you affect the service more than you think you do if you come tonight amen to this prayer line service and you come with an expectation in your heart you come just burning with faith and you come saying Lord I'm going to participate in this thing it might be the greatest meeting you've ever been in because you matter because you're essential to the kingdom of God hallelujah we gotta we got to wrap our minds around that Amen brother Ben talk about little David there was nothing about him he was a little Stripling boy you wouldn't have picked him I wouldn't have picked him but God chose him amen so it's not what we look at and brother Brahm said well you say well brother Branham I wasn't called to be a preacher he said you might be called to be a housewife but you got your position in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost you're just as much David as the rest of them young lady amen how many times have you been made to feel like you're of less value like you're an afterthought like you're a second class person just because you're a woman amen but in God's economy amen you are his elected anointed you are called to be that housewife you are called to be that mother and you are dripping with the oil of anointing you are you are an essential part of the economy of God and God raised you up in this day and he didn't he didn't ask anybody else to fill your place he knew you were the one that could do it and he didn't make you a halfway housewife he didn't make you a halfway mother he didn't make you a halfway young lady a halfway singer a halfway worshiper a halfway puller no he went all the way with you he went all the way to Calvary to produce you God values you amen I know that people don't treat you right I know that there are complexes that come amen with being a Holiness sister and being under the the derision of this world and people making fun and persecuting you amen but if just for a moment amen you could just enter in and have the confidence to rest your soul on how much God thinks of you to make you the banner of this message Amen to to fly you in the face of this world and say this is my bride this is my beauty of Holiness this is my fifth gospel this is my living word you see in the body of Christ every joint supplies remember participation is not an option you cannot be in the body of Christ and just be a consumer you can't just sit there service after service and cross your arms and say oh I hope I hope I hope the singing's good today I hope the preaching's good today I hope he doesn't go too long you know I hope I hope uh entertain me if you can I guess I'm here no friends you're part of this you're part of this you have something you've got to supply do we need it in the economy of God we need you we need young people amen who care about who who will stop comparing themselves to everybody else in the world and stop thinking about comparisons stop thinking about worth stop thinking about complexes and just care about purpose just care about purpose say oh I don't care you know I I don't care what I have to be or what my role is or what anybody thinks about me but let me be a part of this eternal story let me be part of this nobody in the bodies without purpose what is the mystery behind the message Christ in you Christ in you so the mystery is what's being revealed not to you but through you what is being revealed through you that's a question to ask yourself what does God want to reveal through me amen not to your life but through your life Jesus preached about the the 11th Hour workers and there was a group of people that came right at the end you know and and they came and there were people been working all day in the field and then at the 11th Hour some workers came and they just they just had a short quick work uh and they put their labor in and then the master the of the Harvest comes and he hands out all everybody's wages and he paid the ones at the 11th Hour the same that he paid the first ones and they began to look at that and they say that's not fair that's not just you just got here and now you think that you you you deserve the same reward that it that that the ones that the ones that came before you the ones that were here in the first place you think you deserve what Peter had you're a young person in 2023 the Lord might come tomorrow and you think you get to have what Paul had and Peter had you think you got a right to what brother Branham had when you're a teenager and the last little sliver of light doesn't sound fair does it amen and so so people got upset about it but you know what the master said he said I've got a right to call who I want to call and I got a right to pay them what I think they're worth amen he said and there's many that are called there's a lot of people called but there's very few that are chosen and so if you're chosen then you deserve the wage you deserve the value because I called you and you answered and I chose you amen and I want to tell you young people everybody that God called everybody that God chose there's a wage that's due to them amen there is a wage you say well I don't deserve it brother Nathan I just got here I'm just a young person amen that's all beside the point you don't deserve it but it's your do and you've got it coming it's promised to you say brother Nathan there's not enough time to make a difference the Lord's coming tomorrow brother Brown said if the Lord is coming tomorrow but my roof needed fixing I would get up on that roof with a hammer and when the Lord came I'd be up there fixing that roof I say God give us a generation of young people with a cry in their heart say Lord the time is short there's not much opportunity but I will use the opportunity that I have to work for you but well I don't have a Ministry brother Nathan I don't have a special talent maybe all you have is a hammer maybe all you have is a broom maybe all you have is a kind word but I'll tell you what we need it we need some young people to care about the work amen Moses just had a stick Moses knew he couldn't do it Moses knew he couldn't be who he was called to be but the Lord said what's that in your hand Moses he said this this whole thing this is just an old dry stick God said good enough Sanson just had a Jawbone shamgar just had an ox goad young people what's in your hand that's good enough join the work join the work [Applause] there's so much work to do there's Generations that came before us that split churches and hurt feelings and preached false Doctrine there's a whole lot of work to do there's work for Our Generation we've got a cause we've got a purpose we've got stories to rewrite we've got situations to change we've got scars to heal and you can be a part of it if you'll just take what's in your hand and join the work the world's not hurting for potential it's not it's not that we don't have a lack of thirsty people we don't have a lack of hungry Hearts amen there's lots there's a huge Harvest Jesus said the Harvest is great but the workers are few oh one time I read something it stuck with me all these years it was one of those times a little different from now but it was one of those times in the economy where where there the unemployment rates were really high you know the struggle of young people of looking for good work and things and it was one of those times when there was just nothing to be found and everybody was saying there's no work there's no work and I read something somebody said you know they say there's no work but there's bridges falling apart there's young people going hungry there's people that are homeless there's sickness in this world there's disease there's war there's lots of work there's just no jobs and never confuse work for a job young people never think that just because you're not a deacon and just because you're not a preacher and just because you're not a pastor and just because you don't have a position in your church and just because nobody sees what you're doing amen we don't we need young people that don't care about that but they just care about the work God let me work let me make a difference let me be a part of your Harvest I'm not looking for a job I'm not looking for a position I'm not looking for men's Applause I'm looking for purpose I'm looking for Value I'm looking to be a part of this eternal mystery let me work let me work amen is this resonating with a young person today say God with everything in my heart I want that I want purpose I want value I want to be a part of this thing I don't want to sit on the sidelines I don't want to ride the fence all the day I don't want to be undervalued all my life I don't want to compare myself to everybody else I need to I need to work I need a cause I need something greater than myself oh I see it moving on your hearts healing people amen and I'm so blessed to be able to preach to you amen that not only do you have a work amen you are the work of God in this day you are his victory you are his achievement you are his purpose you are his word you are his message you have a work you have a purpose what's in your hand it's enough go to work go to work join this cause work in this 11th hour and if you'll work if you're willing to work young people now if you if you want to be just the you want to be the hot shot in the youth group and you want everybody to see you and know what a great singer you are and and look and and everybody looking at your budding Ministry and you know and and and you want to be the most popular one in the mo amen if you're looking for for that kind of a thing you missed the whole thing amen but if you want to work amen then there's a great work to be done it's not too late to make a difference it's not too late to reap a wage you have a value you have a purpose in this day don't ever let anybody take that away from you brother Brown said actually that the seventh Angels message opened the mystery of the seals and when it did it called the 11th Hour Gentile workers and it called them to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got amen you say you're it you mean that that I amen am do amen what Peter had that I could have what Paul had that I could have those Pentecostal blessings that I could have that Apostolic power that I could be as important to the economy of God as every Messenger as every Prophet as every as every Pastor as every priest absolutely that's what the seventh Angel's message came to tell you that it's not too late but the time is now to receive a bride wage amen you're not supposed to be an entry-level Christian a young person is not supposed to be a part-time believer and you just got in on the ground floor no you're an equal part amen of the economy of God Amen you are you are the expression of his purpose you are as essential as I am essential as any man or woman of God is essential do you believe that hey man you are essential and there is a wage that is coming to you there's a lot of people that appreciate young people and the first thing they want to tell you is that the baptism of the Holy Ghost was just for the Pentecostals and the only way and and that experience of God Amen where the fire of God would fall from Heaven and fill a life well that was for some you know well we had that when I was a young person but now we've got the word and now young people don't get born again lives don't get changed anymore amen demons don't get cast out anymore that was all now we've just got the word and we're a mature church that's not mature that's old and dried up and weak but thank God for a generation of young people amen who recognize amen that if he did it for my father if he did it for my grandfather amen then the same wage that same Pentecostal blessing I've got a right to partake of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've got a right to know Jesus Christ personally I've got a right to have the fire of Heaven amen fall from the sky and fill every fiber of my being and baptize me into the work of God said in 1965 after the seals in case you care about that he said I believe that Pentecost began without an ending it is to Every Creature it is to all times it is to all places Pentecost should always remain and the Pentecostal blessings should be upon the people and what is the Pentecostal blessing it's the confirmation of the Resurrection now if we're going to sit around and belong to a church and talk about how Jesus has risen from the dead you've got to write for something a little deeper than that amen because he didn't just call you out so you could talk about how he was risen from the dead but the Resurrection Life the quickening power the Holy Ghost is promised to you by a Pentecostal blessing that Christ himself can fill your life and make you the evidence of the Resurrection to all times it's all places it never stopped it's still going don't have the baptism the Holy Ghost it's here right now it's his desire to give it to you if Jesus is risen there should be a confirmation in me I want my value I want my purpose I want my wage brother man said are we really getting the people to Christ are we just getting them to church and what are you young people where have we got you with all of our teaching with all of our preaching with all of our church attendance amen have we got you to Christ or you just belong to a message but if you want to know Christ amen then there's a wage that is promised to you you are valuable enough that God wants you to have it he wants to empty out the heavens amen and pour His glory down into this church in this city to these young people and fill every heart with the fire of God Amen to give you the power that Peter had that Paul had that James and John had those sons of thunder that rock the world with the message of their day amen God called you to be the final voice to this final age to fill you with his holy spirit and use you Amen to light Revival fires on every Hilltop that will receive it that's another Post in 63 quote amen God didn't ask you to join the Revival he called you to be the Revival and he promised it would be here he promised you would have it he promised it to all times in all seasons amen I grew up in a message Church I was a message brat amen I I had the pedigree I have always all of my life I have been associated with the message I'm a third generation message believer but God doesn't have any grandchildren God doesn't have any grandchildren and all of that never paid off I never reefed a wage amen by grandpa being a pastor I never reaped a wage just by dad being a deacon I never reaped a wage by being raised right and talking right and dressing right and hanging out with the right people and belonging to the right church I never read the wage amen but one day in a house Amen in the state of Michigan there was a group of young people gathered together it wasn't Church it wasn't a youth meeting it wasn't a special service it was just a youth Gathering amen but at that youth Gathering amen we got in one mind and one Accord and the power of God came from the heavens amen like a heavyweight and a baptized a house full of young people amen not in 1963 not in 1977 but in 2011 2012 God sent a Revival he said every generation has to receive its own Revival your grandfathers and grandmothers had their Revival your father and your mother had their Revival but don't you realize his 11th Hour workers that you've got a right Amen to the wages of Life Today amen you won't reap the wages of sin you're not called to death you're called the life in the Holy Ghost life in Jesus Christ I was there amen when the power filled that building just like it was in the upper room it was exactly the same as it was on the day of Pentecost amen and I've gone around and testified about that amen I've been criticized for it I've been called Pentecostal I've been called I've been you know I've been called uh uh behind I I've been called a fanatic I've been called all those things but it's too late for that because I've already earned the wage I didn't earn it I reaped it amen I was granted this wage you can't tell me God doesn't feel young people with the Holy Ghost I'm just like Mary they could make fun of her amen but brother man said she knew whose child that was she was there when it happened she was the one that had happened too and you can have that same experience today you won't act like I acted you won't feel what I felt but you'll have a real experience of your own it's coming to you amen my brother-in-law he was supposed to be at these meetings my brother-in-law Christopher he was in that place he had juvenile arthritis he was in chronic pain all the time he couldn't play volleyball because he just ached all the time it was chronic it was incurable amen and when that Holy Ghost fell in that place we didn't have any pastors or deacons or Elders of the church to lay hands on him but a group of young people laid hands Amen on a young boy named Christopher amen I asked him years later said Christopher is it true that that really you know that that that that that it was that a true healing he said I've never had a single symptom since that moment you can't tell me God doesn't heal anymore you're too late I've already got the wage [Applause] my little sister my little sister her name is Lauren amen she battled fear all her life she was the most timid backward little girl amen she battled with fear she had a complexes all of her life amen and she just had just enough courage in that atmosphere to say you know what I want deliverance from that thing and I lived with her at that time and I witnessed amen that from that that one day it was this amen but the next day was a whole new girl with a strength with a boldness with a faith amen you can't tell me God doesn't change lives you can't tell me that he doesn't deliver I was there when it happened [Applause] now the Devil is a cruel task master and he doesn't want you to receive the wage that you do he doesn't care if you belong to church he'll let you have a little bit here a little bit there he'll let you raise your arms and song service once in a while he'll let you get a little excited when the preaching is going on but he won't he doesn't want you to have a living wage he doesn't want you to receive a blessing that'll stay with you on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday amen he doesn't mind if you get a little you know if you get a little blessing at a youth camp but but you know that's just a one-time bonus and then you're going back to that slavery amen he's a cruel task master he doesn't want you to to earn enough from this word to have a living he doesn't want you to have freedom he doesn't want you to have a meaning he doesn't want you to have purpose he doesn't want you to receive value but you know what we're going to do this afternoon we're throwing a revolution say your promise a wage you don't have to live below your privileges you don't have to live a miserable life without the full baptism of the Holy Ghost you can walk in full blessing for the promises to you and it's to your children as to as many are far off it's to as many as the Lord Our God shall call and glory be to God he's calling a group of young people in Edmonton today saying Join the Revolution amen get out from under that Taskmaster don't let the devil dictate your value don't let them tell you what kind of a Christian you got to be don't let him make you a part-time believer don't let don't let them just don't let them just let you to the fence and no further this is promised to you this is do you you could never earn it but it's already paid for and we would stand to our feet now as the musicians would come maybe play that song Softly pour your spirit out on me [Music] is promised to you it's a promise to you [Music] the Revival didn't end in our parents generation our grandparents generation brother branham's generation he said that our generation every generation has to receive their own Revival and when he spoke of a bride's Revival when he spoke of an invincible Army when he spoke of Supernatural when he spoke of overcoming power he wasn't just speaking of the ones that we look up to it wasn't just speaking of Our Heroes of the faith our elders our preachers our ministers you were in that mystery [Music] do you believe that tonight then if you're part of that eternal life then you're just as essential you're just as valuable you've got just as much a right as any of the rest [Music] so I'm going to open up the altar today it's not an altar that could save you but it's your faith at the altar I'd like to just invite you [Music] and you could tell by the way that I'm approaching this I'm not trying to manufacture a response I don't want I don't want just a dry-eyed obedience just to get a group of young people at an altar but I have invested my energy into this service because I believe that there's a value laying in you as a group of young people I believe that there's a great potential in each and every one of your lives I believe that you matter but even if I didn't it wouldn't change the fact that you matter so I want to invite you if you've never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost why not receive it today you say well brother Nathan I all these thoughts of worth all these thoughts of Merit all these thoughts of earning it and and and comparing oh but uh but but I'm not jumping like he was when he got it I'm not shouting like he was when he got it [Music] but that's not that's that relative value but just to know that it's promised to you promise to you say brother Nathan I want the Holy Ghost so bad but I just can't get over that I can't get over that that that that just that lack of self-worth that complex that that fear that holds me back I just can't break through that to just believe that it's for me but doesn't it help you to really to know that brother Braham said God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you could desire it so if there's something burning in your heart saying brother Nathan I want to be part of this work I want the I want to be part I want meaning I want purpose I want reality I don't want to be a fence writer I don't want to just Philip you I want to be part of this message I want to be born into this Kingdom amen then it's only evidence that God wants it he wants it so bad he's wanted it for since before the foundation of the earth I would invite you to come as we sing tonight and receive it maybe you've got the Holy Ghost but you have been living so far below your privileges and you've had that false humility you've had that Pride that won't let you it just won't let you believe it won't let you accept what God thinks about you you'd rather stay with your complexes you'd rather stay with your lack of self-worth you'd rather stay with your fear than enter into his presence and let him lavish his love on you amen then why not lay it down today why not why not live in the full blessing of the Holy Ghost in the full knowledge of a son or a daughter of God oh friends it's got to be something that happens between you and him in this moment you've got to receive this pardon pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain saturate my thirsty soul come and fall afresh on me fill my cup again [Applause] heal my heart and make me hold I need you now for your spirit out
