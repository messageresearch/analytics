to welcome you to these meetings we're here to have a conference with god the work week is over we've settled in and i just say let's stay in this atmosphere through the weekend let's let god be god let's let him move in our midst amen that's what we're looking for we welcome you all i'm not going to have you be seated because i'm not going to be long we're going to let our brother come and minister right away so just stand up for a moment and stay with me i want to just just say welcome to all the visiting brothers that are here we've had some visiting ministers from saskatchewan brother meno so good to see you for the dwayne fair as well brother kelly so good to have you here brother kelly and then brother paul dierksen as well i think brother brent is coming in yet this weekend but we welcome you brother barry johnson i believe also from calgary brother darren really good to see you and also i want to welcome all the local brothers ministers brother steve you've already been mentioned so you're you're supposed to be a visitor but you you're local enough that we're we're mentioning you we had a great time in the service last night i believe god was beginning to move us in a channel and in a direction i'd like you just to keep those thoughts before you and just want to remind you he's a supernatural god you cannot separate the word from the supernatural and and i believe that god is wanting to do some things and we need to put ourselves in a position for a miracle and like i said we can't manufacture it but god can make it happen and he'll work it i believe this is our turn this is our hour and i believe that god has raised us up he is preparing us for what he wants to do and i i believe there's something that's rising up and we sang that last night but i i don't believe it's just emotion i think it's it's really deep within there is something that is rising you know it's there and we're wanting god to do it and i tonight i just want to say we're going to take this a step further we're going to we're going to have our brother tim pruitt minister today i first heard brother tim in 1985 in michigan that's 38 years ago and i can say one thing when you hear brother tim it'll be straight it's going to be the gospel without compromise and i and i say a real christian wants it that way and i i would just say if anything there's only been a maturing and uh we we've we've appreciated brother tim and the ministry over the years and and i i believe it as brother branham would say i think it was in questions and answers they they asked him will the bride have a ministry and and he said oh that's what's going on right now and he said it consists of prophets and apostles and pastors and evangelists and teachers it'll be a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour and it'll be so humble because it's not a minister lifting himself up but it's a minister under the anointing of a mighty angel lifting up christ the word made known in this hour and i believe as if you could have looked down in time i believe brother tim was part of that group i believe these brothers were part of that group i believe there's other brothers that were part of that group and i want to say brother tim is experienced he's well-versed in the bible in the message of the hour and he also has an awareness of where we're at and i i believe that god is going to move him and use him and let's just be in that channel i'm going to just change the order a little bit i just want to remind you tomorrow we have a full day we have a for the ministers that are here we're going to have a breakfast in the morning if you haven't been invited and you want to do just come see me after the service if you're a minister and we're not going to ordain you to be a part of the breakfast don't worry you're only going to be if you're established minister okay is that right and we've got that in the afternoon we've got a youth service at 1 30 and so they'll be here brother timothy pruitt will be speaking tomorrow night our brother ron spencer is going to speak six o'clock tomorrow and i believe we're building to what god's going to do more and more and uh so we're just looking forward to what the lord has let's just sing he brought me out of the mirey clay if we can sing that tonight was distressed keith joe oh that's great and low in the paint where my dragged me down i cried to the lord from the deep my reclaim who tenderly brought me out to golden he day me out of my replay and he set my feet on the rock to stay he puts a song in [Music] [Music] [Applause] until the crowd i came oh [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i'll sing of his wonderful mercy to me oh i praise him till all then his goodness shall see and i'll say of salvation [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he set my feet on the rock to stay he puts a song in my soul today a song of praise [Music] hallelujah 5. [Music] and i'll praise the dear father who answered my prayer i'll sing my new [Music] replay he set my feet on the rock to stay he puts the song in my soul today a song of [Music] to [Music] hallelujah hallelujah just worship him a moment thank you lord your brother's out of the mirror clay your centerpiece upon the rock hallelujah we thank you father blessed be the name of the lord glory to your name what a mighty god we serve how good he is to us his children tonight we sure love the lord tonight love his people it's good to be back in edmonton again and have this privilege of being with you again for one of these these meetings here in your summer we've enjoyed them this spring weather that you have here it's really really nice amen but it's so it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight and just to be able to share the good things of god and be with god's wonderful people to see each one of you again after you know we um we're just here back in may and with um the memorial service for our brother harold and and this is really a special moment for me because um back in april near brother harold's birthday or perhaps it was on his birthday i text him and wished him a happy birthday and it was there he asked me to come to be in this meeting and to minister he had been working in conjunction with brother hamer meister for me to come and to accompany brother um brother ron spencer and uh to be with you in these special meetings that he has ministered here now for a number of years and um so you know to to get to come and to be is here together with him is really special and amen it's a it's a dream it's uh it's a it's a joy to be together with you brother ron and the these two men are my heroes i'll tell you what um it's a privilege to work together with my son i told brother hemmermeister when he when he asked me to come and confirm the the um the request to come that brother harold had given i said well i guess you know you get two with in in the package because i don't i don't come without my son and uh i used to of course travel with my wife she's been going on to the lord be with the lord now nearly a year ago but my son's been traveling with me when i go but um we're we're here to serve the great king of glory and worship the lord together with you amen so it's good to be here with you i think about it my first time to speak in edmonton i was only 34 at the at the 1988 um convention that you hosted and put on this church has always been a mission missionary-minded church and had invited ministry from around the world and i was privileged to be able to speak in that convention and and uh now here we are 34 years later and we're still pressing on amen we're here in this meeting tonight i believe because it god has ordained this moment so we're stepping right into the vision of god's uh ordained plan for us right here at this hour and so as we do it i just want you to turn your attention to the lord and let him speak to you let him reveal himself to you in a very special way because god is real and he wants to make himself real to you amen so i trust that he will do that tonight i know he will because i'm i'm standing here before a portion of the bride of christ and i think of where paul admonished us by the holy spirit you know for our wives to for the husbands to show their wife a due benevolence and to minister to their needs and to see to their desires in their heart now god couldn't tell us men to do that and then him be a husband and not keep his own word so therefore if you've got a need here tonight he's husband enough to come by your way to minister to your need he's a personal god and he wants to minister personally to you tonight you got a need in your heart in life let's just take it to him right now as we pray you just hold it before the lord jesus i'm so needy of you [Music] the song says i can't find the way alone lord we can't do anything without you but without you we are nothing lord i stand here as a mere mortal and i know it takes your anointing i know it takes the power of the holy spirit to get into the word and make it live lord before mere fragments of thoughts that i have penned and the scriptures and quotations that i have collected and put together in what we call a sermon but lord his sermon must be god breathed it must be anointed and these fragments of paper or thoughts that we append they're just they're just scattered like on a sea of can be blown around by the wind or this or that and man's ideas but lord if you'll come if you'll come and you'll just gather all of these thoughts and direct them to the target and minister [Music] may it be here tonight that you minister to your bride the elect lady that you whisper love secrets to her that you let her know she's not forgotten that you are here in her midst to bring healing and deliverance and salvation that ever needs supply lord i want to thank you oh god for the many years that this work has went on and how we've admired and appreciated the ministry here now our brother ed mcmeister is is doing his best to step forward to carry it on lord i pray now father that you will continue to work in this community even as your prophet would come and minister here in this city and its neighboring towns and in the neighboring provinces lord you cared for the canadian people and they were there represented in the vision of the bride oh god of people that would be in step with the word a people who would march in tune with onward christian soldiers and i pray tonight that there will be another step onward lord that we'll advance toward eternity knowing lord that we're called and we're ordained in this hour and for this reason we are called and i ask now lord that you'll pour out your spirit upon us may it be that there's men and women tonight that have emptied of themselves made room for the holy spirit to come into their lives minister them in a special way lord and the rest of the media when our brother ron speaks what we want to thank you for the miracle in his life and the encouragement that we have taken from his courage and i pray lord that as he steps forward that you would use him in a great way use us all again for your your glory and the services to come we give ourselves to you and dedicate ourselves to you for that purpose in jesus name amen amen god bless you if you'll turn with me to joel chapter 2 we'll read from verse 25 and we trust the lord will help us to bring a little thought here tonight and um you know we're already 8 35 now into um into the service and and um you know we we know there's no work day tomorrow and uh we know we're in a convention and service is here and man we just um you know someone said well brother tim you got enough battery here to last four hours i said i said we don't have pews that would last four hours so i pray that god will just help us here tonight amen and speak to us in a real and living way job chapter 2 verse 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the kanka worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat them plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i'm in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed you'll never be left holding the bag or you know go away empty my people will never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit you notice it's not limited just to men but it's to it speaks of sons and daughters it speaks of servants and handmaids amen i'm i'm glad this gospel encompasses all and it's a pouring out on all flesh it's wonderful that we can enter into the spirit and and even sisters can rejoice in god and say man and hallelujah thank you jesus and worship god and and brothers can can respond to the great things that god is doing amen amen before you're seated let's just read this from the message expectation now you're going to be expecting a great healing service tomorrow night going to be expecting the lord to pour out his blessings tomorrow night sure let's be expecting it be under expectation oh i expect the church to be on fire the glory of the lord fallen everywhere centers around the altar and people getting saved and filled with the holy ghost just a great thing and my anticipations and expectations has built up way up high i felt led to come out to california and i want to say with that felt led to come here to be a part of this meeting and he's going to do something for somebody amen that's one thing sure i'm expecting it to happen because i feel led to do it i feel led to say what i say i feel led to do the things i am doing or i wouldn't do it i want to be led of it and then i'm expecting something to happen amen god bless you you can be seated he had a prayer for his people that i want to read as he prayed over a congregation in chicago and he said father god i can hear the stream of the lamb of calvary and it makes me seek and hunger and thirst and i see his little children dying satan's got them all bound up some of them are sick and afflicted oh god that cry that cry of a sinful world that cry of a people that's been caught up by the devil who wants to be liberated they're screaming for mercy oh god send preachers from this meeting send missionaries from here send them from this convention lord to go out with a new vision into the fields to win souls may they go out with such a gallant heroism and the high blood of christ beating through their veins as it was that has been changed by the great miracle of the new birth and send them as real heroes of the cross may they preach like never before may mothers be real mothers god may they dismiss that babysitter and keep away from the bar room and throw down those cigarettes and dress like a mother ought to and be a real mother granted lord when they hear the cry of juvenile delinquency everywhere and all this great distress may dads be real dads lord oh god let them from keep them from the bar room and the pool hall and let them lay down the old weapons of carnal things and step out with the weapons of the holy ghost tonight and fight as never before bless everyone who raised their hand bless those that had convictions that didn't raise their hand and all together lord give us all thy blessings and make this the greatest convention that's been here yet because we ask it in christ's name i think that prayer is good here for tonight let it be the greatest convention that there's been yet tonight i want to speak on a subject of is there hope for revival you know today it's somewhat questionable in the mind of many as to whether we can even have a revival uh you know revival's over brother tim and there's just no hope for revival after the word's been revealed and we're just to settle down in our churches and instead of instead of being under a baptist or methodist or pentecostal label we just take on a new label of being under a message banner but i want to say we have not come to this land of the open book to the restored word just to settle down and to have churches under a new name with new doctrines but we have returned to the land of the bible to welcome back the messiah amen and we cannot do that encumbered with the spirit of laodicea and without the spirit of revival and this is a rapture age and the very word rapture means intense pleasure or enthusiasm i tell you if we are people of the rapture we should be a people who take great pleasure in serving god with a great enthusiasm for the truth that we have received now we know this is a laodicean age and and we've already had in this age great stirrings of the holy spirit why the age would begin with the azusa street revival in 1906 and then in 1946 the angel of god came to brother branham who was instructed to take a message of divine healing to the world and then that sparked the great divine healing revivals of the 40s and the 50s and and you sometimes wonder what was that revival like and the message influenced brother branham lets us know he said i as he was in beaumont texas speaking that said i was here with my old friend brother bosworth and raymond ritchie and many of the brethren i still believe the same gospel hadn't changed a bit just the same but you see the revival was going on then and where there's no revival you just can't get things done the ministry is far more advanced it was only telling you then that this would come and how many remembers that sure you're doing it and come just exactly like it said it would i and then i'd take my hand the people and lay my hands upon them i told them i told you what he told me and that's just the way it happened it's just exactly it never failed to be the truth each and every time so it has to come from god no one could doubt it but you see the revival is not owned you just your presence adjust your presence to walk in the in with the people while the people would get up off of their cots and stretchers and walk around you just lay hands on them and mother just sent them a whirling and i've seen lions would be three or four or 500 people come through the lines deaf dumb blind cross side not one of them would fail but would be healed every one of them but try it today there's no fire in rome when the fires went out in the temple in vista the people went home you see there's now there's no revival fire to back it up see that it's just it and and after a while if the world stands they'll start living in the glare again and that's the way it's always been passed over and missed them and that generations be judged for what passed over them and they failed to see it jesus christ is alive this afternoon he's walking around with us now he's ever present where two or more are gathered in my name i am there in the midst believe that won't you now you know and i wonder today sometimes how much many are living in the glare again of a past move of god and yet have no revival fire today missing something that is very necessary he says he speaks again in denim springs louisiana and this is again a 1964 quotation he said we just witnessed one of the greatest revivals i believe that the world has ever seen this last 10 15 years been revival not like the days of billy sunday or the days of welsh revival or days of the wesley revival and moody revival billy sunday revival it's been a worldwide sweeping affair around the world great healing services great revival fires have burnt practically on every hill in the world right tonight way over in the lands of africa china japan this gospel being preached and people are being healed right this very minute around and around the world has been one of the greatest revivals because i believe it's it's one of the last revivals this world will see a world sweep and revival but now in the last few years is quieting down and you don't notice the enthusiasm in the people that used to be i remember having the privilege by the holy spirit to spearhead that revival that started um there when the angel lord appeared on the river and said that many years ago and see it happen and see ministers hearts of fire everywhere and revivals broke out why you could just walk into the building and people would get up out of their carts cots and stretchers and walk away healed you didn't have to say a word just being there was all it took and i remember one night in vandalia illinois i walked in the media and had no more been in the meeting around five mil over five minutes and there wasn't a feeble person around that place anywhere wheelchairs pushed out and piled up blind was seeing deaf and dumb speaking just simply the holy spirit of the lord was present and he just healed the whole group of them now that's when you can do something when revival is going on but let the revival fire die down then you can hardly now watch this the people are still christians but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something it's just like in a forge in a blacksmith shop you've done got to get it the iron hot before you go to pound it on it in the anvil if you don't you'll never straighten it out and that's what it takes to have a revival is everyone under the heat of the holy spirit that's brought down the powers of god and revival movement then there's prayer meetings going on day and night and every minute everywhere while the people wouldn't even leave the grounds and of course we know that was the divine healing revival and and brother branham would announce to us it is over it is finished and again it did come to an end and there was things that caused the ending of that revival and we want to talk about how that you know some killers of revival and what it takes there to have revival again now and is there even a revival left that is promised for us in this last day or have we seen our last revival and and then we look at the divine healing revival and and and asked the question did it even bring the promised rapture that was desired and or did it just make bigger denominations and and add more members as brother branham said i i sent three quarters of a million of my children to the assembly of god and others went to oneness and full gospel and brother branham talks about this in the message paul a prisoner and he talks about how that moses you know he he took him out in the desert and he kept him out there for 40 years and there god stripped him of all his theology and his ambition where he could look back and he could see his failure and how tonight we ought to do the same thing when we see our ambition look at the divine healing campaign and see if the lord didn't do something a few years ago to start healing restore restoring healing to the sick and so forth everybody every organization is because it didn't come to their organization they had to get them a healer you see see again in that revival a revival killer began when men began to rise up who were only really truly interested in kingdom buildings now what have we done he said we've done the same thing that moses did we went out and tried so hard to manufacture a miracle i smelt a disease i got blood in my hand manufacturer miracle and what have we got some men and went into hard strains and broke up become regular drunkards and neurotics and got their minds switched all the way back the order from the pentecostal objective back to making organizations again and things you see you see they they took that moment of revival and built their kingdom bigger you had men that would get in the ministry and they had to have their their gift it would be their ministry and they're going to be the man of the hour you have a a allen who died a drunk and old jaggers who tried every gimmick to keep in the limelight and all roberts who prophesied of a 900 foot tall jesus who told him that you know to raise millions of dollars or god would kill him and he died in a condition of of you know in in shame that he brought to the whole movement of the divine healing movement there and and so brother brandon said what have we done in other words what does it accomplish we slew about one egyptian you see that's what we tried we strained we paid we've labored we go all night in prayer meetings and we until we had no voice we tried to manufacture something and soup up something and all these types of things and find it to be a total failure he said we need to go have a going back to the desert well yes he said camp meetings and struggles why not just give up that's what you ought to do just go back and give up what we have done the same thing that moses did it doesn't do any good after 40 years he found himself a prisoner to the word of god what do we try to do he said when that great blessing came out and the manifestation of the great things that god had told us about how we must be born again how we must receive the holy ghost the baptism in the name of jesus christ all of these things instead of people staying to that word and harness to it what did they do they started their own denominational theory which had already failed and tried to manufacture something that looked like the truth and he said what have we got tonight a nation full of organized people who deny the scriptures of god who would call the life of the holy spirit is a mental telepathy who would refuse it to come in their church and they wouldn't permit you to mention one word of serpent seed or eternal security on the things that the holy spirit has revealed and proved to be the word i may challenge after challenge to come and prove it to me wrong and what have they done the same that luther had the rest of them flew an egyptian what was it maybe made some man stop stealing or maybe live true to his wife but then what do you make out of him a church member come and join our group and that stinking dead man was the only thing he could point his finger to it was a success of 40 years of training a stinking egyptian laying there rotten and dead and he said that's the way it is tonight the only thing we can point to in this revival that's crossed over so-called is a stinking bunch of church members that know no more about god than a hot dog but know about an egyptian night right telling them about the word of god i say i don't believe that and say i don't care what they say i don't believe it that's a awful thing to have to be a point back to for all the strains and the struggles and everything we've got maybe we could point to a big school but it's dead we could point to an organization but it's dead it is thinking it's just like the first thing we pulled out of like a hog going this wall or dog just vomit when we return back one dead egyptian and i just want to say that's not what the message was sent to produce it's was set to produce a rapture and a people with faith for a rapture a people of the promise a people who know their god who just exploits a people who has a life a drive a passion a burden something down on the inside not a not just a bunch of stinking dead church members men and women you know that maybe they live through their husband or maybe they pay tithes to the church or maybe they quit stealing and we made a good citizen for canada that's not what the message was to produce it's not just to produce another bunch of denominational chickens amen it's to produce eagles who soar in the heavens where all things are possible to them that believe now out of that movement to begin with the revival at azusa street and the divine healing revival you know there are now 644 million pentecostals and charismatics worldwide including all the members of pentecostalism there are 19 300 denominations and fellowships so that's what it all created amen 0.6 billion over half a billion people who claim azusa street as their roots and think about it again you know 19 300 denominations and fellowships for god's sake how in the world did they get so divided they could make 19 300 of them so you know and and so we we ask the question what would even another divine healing movement produce what about america would she ever have another revival you know we had men raised up among the evangelicals and you know with jerry falwell is moral majority there ain't no moral majority i don't know what you got in canada and all about your politics but there is not a moral majority in america there's an immoral majority i tell you today you are an endangered species [Applause] amen you are in a minority and even even even even today the conservatives are yesterday's liberals there's no such thing as a true conservative except the bride of jesus christ and america has become a godless nation who has now turned from lamb with freedom of religion to a dragon a beast that devours amen it's a spirit of lawlessness that has taken over our country defend the police have you ever heard of such a thing in your life you know rioting in the street with sodomites screaming for the rights to kill their children can you imagine that but it's not just america it's the insanity is going on around the world sodom is no longer a city sodom is not just one country son of sodom is a world we are living in a sodom world branham talks about this and is your life worthy of the gospel he said they were invited to a feast and he said america there had been invited to he feast he said england had a chance at revival and he's saying then he you talked about how that they had been weakened to the sex of women until spies would come in usually using that and their sin of scandals of the government has so disgrace their disgrateful name across the world now this is 1963 it sounds like i'm reading from prophecy that are things he's saying right now and man she's rejected the truth she had she had her excuses she made excuses why not to come to the feast and she's finished she's washed up america 15 years ago when the great divine healing revival continued on from pentecost broke out in the nations and there was a revivals on the capitol washington dc the president vice presidents great people governors great things taking place and and men healed like cover congressman upshaw had been a for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before them and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there is no hope for it she has crossed the line between judgment and mercy she's elected what she has in here to control the nation and now since 63 we've done the same thing we've got another catholic president i mean just the pope just happened to come to apologize to the first nation people for for slavery and and for abusing and murder and and raping and and mistreating people have to apologize i'll tell you what friends we have no such apologies to make the gospel we have preached have delivered men and women from slavery from sin from unbelief from darkness hallelujah amen we need not make an apology for the blood of jesus christ for the power of god under salvation amen we need not make a an excuse or apology to see young men and young women get filled with the holy ghost and become real daddies and real mamas but you see america she's elected what she has in men men of corrupt minds here we we saw brother branham could could never make it out exactly right he said it could be in the catholic church it could be some woman as president or vice president it was both of them we elected a catholic president at the same time a woman we're right here in the fulfillment of prophecy who is pushing down upon the world a liberal world order of sodomy of sin of evil of a dragon rising up with the spirit and the nature of the devil demon possessed men and women who are under a spirit of insanity and america can never have a revival and the world will never have a revival amen the holy spirit was poured out upon russia very even and they were called to the feast of pentecost you can read this in their in their very history in the in the days before azusa the holy spirit fell upon them and then ukraine and those people there moved out into the states and were part of the azusa movement and whatever she was offered and called the to the feast of pentecost a spiritual feast and they turned it down england was given their chance america has been given their chance amen and but he said i believe maybe within the next and he said the table is ready there is still room the table's got to be set go and compel those people to come in and i believe maybe within the next or month or something a year or whatever it is god is going to send another shaking across the country for there's somebody out there still somewhere that's a predestinated seed that that light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation is gone but god is still calling seed hallelujah and i believe there's seed in this meeting hallelujah i believe there are those that have been a wayward and away from god that god is calling back home i believe there is a pride that has been received a call come back to the land come back to the promise of the lord get back in step [Applause] amen you can give me just a little more sound up here now we know of a certain that we cannot reproduce the azusa revival and neither should we try and neither should we try to reproduce another divine healing revival or any other worldwide sweeping revival that accomplished you know the great feat of adding billions of people to come to the cause for the past hundred years the charismatics the pentecostals have tried to breathe new revival and breathe life into new revival fires into that movement and they're blown and blown and blown upon the ashes of that revival with the only results being the soot of the pacifiers blocking in their face and we know you know even even there are many there that are trying to do god as service without his will pray now and call on god and surely america come back she won't her revival is pastor and there are those who say like they did to brother branham in that day where we can only have revival if we take the word or word by word page by page letter by pa letter and and we got to find the right in greek interpretation and and brother branham said himself i hadn't read too much but reading the history of the church and the nicene council on the pre-night seeing council and nicean fathers they were arguing all back there about the greek and that's been 2 000 years ago and it means this and others said it means that and this greek word says it means that what it is what happened we have built over 40 000 denominations off of one bible there's over 40 000 denomination christian denominations in the world today each one's saying they are the way or the one bible i wonder how many denominations we can build off of 1100 tapes you see again you know we we got to we got to look back and see what god has promised as he said a revival will never come until god the sovereign god sends it and he might take a little nitwit they can't sign his name amen because god is not known by how well he speaks the english or how well he knows the greek or well he got this interpretation right he's he's known by the spirit of god the power of the holy ghost and my men like peter who couldn't sign their own name they were ignorant and unlearned but you knew this one thing about it they had been with jesus amen and he says now if there's anybody got mechanics for revival it's our noble brother and billy graham the mechanics is all right but the mechanics won't move it it takes the dynamics to move it you can build an automobile you put fine seats in it you can make fine pistons and you can prove by science what it can do but unless the dynamics is there she's just a dead piece of goods so in the welsh revival he said he spoke he said no one knew what started that revival it was a sovereign move and then he said our friend billy graham and them they'll go and they'll they'll have a meeting and thousands have come to the altar and he said you know what one year later you can't even find one you see because it does never inoculate him from sin amen but let god and his sovereign grace speak to some little nitwit elsa say a little nobody and let his spirit fall into a city and a man can go i can't go to work a woman can't wash the dishes the maid can't make the bed of screaming and crying with their hands up in the air that's revival in the will of god amen and he said that sovereign that's what god does he alone has a right to sin revival not just get the mechanics together is pray for god to send the dynamics but you know so many of the message community are void of the dynamics all they have is a biligram type of mechanics even the conversion it is offered is a billy graham type conversion of easy believism billy graham would help thousands who would respond to the pleas come up and receive christ as your lord of your life and confess i'm a sinner and i accept christ as my savior and he found that most of them didn't stick he could come back after thirty thousand had pledged to receive christ come back a year later couldn't find ten it stayed true and he blamed it on lazy preachers but brother branham said that that wasn't the problem the problem wasn't lazy preachers the problem was he didn't take him far enough and today it's not come up and accept jesus since even altar calls are now frowned upon so just sit tight in your seat and accept the message and believe brother branham is your prophet and and if you believe that you've got the holy ghost and i would call that the new birth is blasphemy amen no wonder we got a bunch of a bunch of rotten eggs in the nest we got men and women who have never been with the mate jesus christ you say brother tim i'm a predestinated seed but that seed has to be germinated by the holy ghost and that takes an experience of something that light the fire down on the inside amen brother harold always had this statement that he always would say he said this message cannot be passed on intellectually and this is why there are so many seeds today that have fallen along the wayside and among thorns those seeds were those sown among thorns a long path they never reach fruition they perish they never produce the the promised harvest and brother branham said that's the way many people does about coming to christ they laid the foundation of believing on the lord jesus and accepting this personal savior and maybe going on to a christian baptism but when it comes to following on through to the baptism of the holy spirit somebody explains it away for them and that's the reason that seed fell by the wayside or fell on stony grounds so this brings us to the cycle of revival and death and you see this is where he would say to the first stage i've got something what against you because you left your first love and so you got to understand he was not just speaking to the ephesus church but this message that he was speaking he was it would speak to the entire age and and he said he goes on he talks about the revival that was with in the generations of israel you see revival in one generation and then only see the fires fade into the next in the third generation embers may be glowing ever so slightly in the fourth generation there's no vestige whatsoever of the original flame you know what that tells us god has no grandchildren he only has sons and daughters of god amen every generation must have their chance at their revival then god will light the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of the truth god has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth you see this and in the word you start out truly being with born-again christians or believers in the next generation they're no longer just plain christians but they take a denominational name of baptist or methodist or perugia or two lord or seven thunders or return ministry or middle of the road or whatever you want to brand yourself labels us for no more you see and it gets to a point they take on a denominational name that fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit it begins to fade instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it's cooled off and become a bit formal this was happening to the ephesians they were they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to god was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what god thought of them is what to begin to get careful about what the world thought of them the second generation was coming up just like israel they demanded a king to be like the other nations we we gotta we gotta have our own personality cult leader you see you see a king like the other nation but when they did that they rejected god amen but they did it anyway and that's the history of the church when he thinks more confirmed conform into the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long do you see them stop doing the things he used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get locks and that's what the ephesus means is relaxed and drifting that cycle of revival and death has never failed he said all you have to do is recall this last move of god in the spirit with men and women dressed like christians went to church prayed all night took to the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches and they worshipped in homes or old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long that they got enough money to be able to find new churches they put in a choir instead of singing to god for themselves they put gowns on the choir they organized the movement ran it by man it wasn't soon they were they were reading books it wasn't fit to read and they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over and the cry of joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone all they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and the blackness of isis is all about that is left cycle of revival and death don't you realize even this movement will go down into death it has never failed and we see it dying amen spiritually dying we may have bigger buildings we don't have you know better dress we may we may be more affluent but where's the holy ghost [Applause] by in lords the church is missing something amen the revival has died down and people have let the revival die down in their own lives are you with me amen and many have never been touched by the fire of god themselves all they've been shown is a picture of it and you just can't get warmed by a painted fire may look pretty it may look real it may it may look amazing the artist might have done a great work but friends it's fake [Applause] the only way that you can get warm is have that original fire and every individual must receive that fire [Applause] but i will tell you that i believe that in this age that there is a group of cycle breakers amen i read in the bible that he said i will have a church and she will be without spot or without a wrinkle or without a blemish hallelujah somebody's going to break the cycle of revival and death are you with me now i read in the church in the bible and said there will be a church those that are alive and remain at the covenant of the lord that will not hinder those that are asleep i hear i read in the bible there's going to be some cycle breakers [Applause] a people that's not going to leave out of here defeated a people that will be overcomers victorious a people who know their god who does exploits [Applause] it's not all bad news some will go down into death but there's somebody going into life there's a rapture promise [Applause] while the world is falling come on going down into the pits there's a bride ascending see not getting weaker she's going to be stronger brother branham preaches a sermon called how can i overcome this is 1963 after the seals has been open the land is open to us how can i overcome he said i got this thought because i was crossing an old creek or or a hollow there was an old beach log that was laying there and he said there this one this little log i stepped on it and tried to walk across it to cross this hollow and he said when i did a big old trunk fell off and i looked at it and he said here to think of it it's laying here right in the source of life the stream of water but without life in it it rottens twice as quick think about that you can rotten twice as quick just sitting right there with a stream of water is flowing because there's no life in you [Applause] and he said i chose this subject of how can i overcome because i think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die now we went to america not being able to have revival in the divine healing movement being over and these revival cease to a prophet telling you i chose this how can i overcome somebody's going to overcome stop and think about it amen he cannot say to him that overcometh unless somebody's going to overcome [Applause] the word is already spoke there's going to be overcomers in this age who will overcome the lego laodicean spirit amen and he said i chose us i think it's time we should never let the spirit of revival die we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day paul said died daily so christ could live oh he said these christians are becoming so soft and doty dead and sins and trespasses so long they can't hold no weight at all they don't know what overcoming means i begin to think of this text overcome keep life in you amen when life went out that's what brought this log to that condition made it worse than what it ever been when it laid in the branch where the water was you take a christian that's supposed to be a christian and let the life of god go from him and experience and the joy of serving christ and that living in a church where such is going on he rottens twice as quick living right under and if we're trying to follow the message of the hour we should live constantly in the life of christ because if you don't you lay around you know that that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the bible said he that know what to do good don't do it do the naughty to him with sin then you're dody you're rotten and you're separated from the life of god's strife with all that is in you to stay in the life of christ and you be fruit bearing are you with me now so we see now how this laodicean age it it see how it closes out and see the church failing to overcome becoming lukewarm and powerless and jesus refused entrance into his own church and i'll tell you there's too many places that the spirit is not welcome and is not wanted amen listen brother adam said of the bride she will not be laid to see us by no means a lukewarm she'll be on fire for god she'll be moving in the spirit of god he speaks of this in revelation 3 to the laodiceans and he said how god describes this last age and he says you know that certainly fits the situation of the day of the modern church today a lukewarm condition neither cold nor hot it would be better if we would be back in our old denominational state or status or either be up in the realms of the blessing of god than to sit in a lukewarm condition as we are now god would appreciate us much more if we would do that so you see you see when when we allow the fire to get down in our own lives when we're not constantly pouring on the wood of the word we're not building it up in prayer and and relationship with god now then you see that's a revival killer now here's another revival killer you know a revival killer another reason for no revivals well we we have preached and it's so true we are predestinated and we are secure but if we're not careful we take an attitude the rest of them can go to hell if [Applause] that we get unconcerned about the lost you know it all becomes about us for and no more and we close our hearts and our doors to everybody else in the fifth seal brother branham said john wesley come along after zingli had come in and then with calvin and he calvin got to church to play some security they didn't want more revivals whatever it's going to be is going to be that's all they just lived any kind of lives and this can be we get we get we don't want revival because we're just happy with the status quo we're just happy with a denominational life in a message church and we got the truth and we go to church and we do our little thing and we're we're saved and we're predestinated and blessed god our my name was on the book of life before the foundation of the world and we get to the point we don't want a revival because we're so secure we're so sure we're going to make the rapture that there is no call of god for more of god there's no more hunger to know his word there's no more passion for truth there you know again our study comes around to prove a point rather than the seal of the hour to repent that's the whole thing that we ought to do is we ought to look at the message and say lord oh god let me find where i need to straighten up a little bit i need to come a little closer to you amen change me forget about changing everybody else i need to be changed god i need a revival in myself i need the holy spirit to live in my life meant to manifest yourself through me well that old man dream dreams and young men see vision and god you poured out your spirit upon men and women and in the church [Applause] [Music] here's another revival killer in every age we've had the same pattern brother branham said this is why the light comes a god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads a light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught but of course all those who don't go who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember paul warned the people to say only what he said first corinthians 14 37 if any man thinks himself a be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write into you are the commandments of the lord what came the word of god out from you or cave it unto you only they add here and they take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of god and paul warned him to say what he said peter did likewise he warned them that even he paul could not change one word of what he had been given by revelation how important it is to hear the voice of god by the way of his messenger and then say what has been given them to say to the churches he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the church in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you're a christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to the to every age will preach that word every fresh and true revival will be because man has gotten back to the word for their age the cry of every age is a rebuke you've left the word of god repent come back to the word from the first book of the bible genesis the last book of revelation there's only one reason for god's displeasure leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word in ephesian age this age and every age we contemplate we will see that it's true and the last stages our age will find a blackout of the word the complete apostasy ended in the great tribulation if you're truly seed if you're baptized with the holy ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god but what have we done in the last 50 years we've had a time of great training great teachings you know and and great training of ministers and things that and i'm quoting brother branham that's taking the place of all night prayer meetings the only time way that you used to get to god instead of having preachers we got lectures man who knows the word just as well they can sit there and put it together in such a way it's astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics but that ain't the dynamics we don't we want the dynamics he said i don't care about the mechanics i want to know the dynamics what does it do hey man i don't know how that car runs out there it's got piston cylinder i don't know how much pressure is used the only thing i know is the dynamics put her out there and drive it and that's what we know god made the promise i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy how's he going to do it i can't tell you i just know the dynamics of god's system i tell you what when brother random left us he left us a car that ran are you with me it would drive down the road to divine healing oh yeah it would drive down to the real power of god it would drive down to god godly men and godly women and prayer lodge come on church it was a car that would go somewhere i mean it just didn't sit as a model sitting in a garage somewhere that would polish the hubs and we talk about it's fine it's fine paint job and it's fine uh arts and it's fine steering wheel and the dough skin seats and oh it's fine it's fine and you know we got the right kind of hubcaps oh it's a beautiful car oh it's a lovely message no the message worked it would heal the sick it would cast out devils it would give overcoming lives it would give the power of god [Applause] but you know the problem is we've had too many quack mechanics that's wanted to try to tinker with the car until in too many churches the motor won't even turn over anymore and it ain't drove out of the garage in years it won't take young people down to a real christ-like experience of the baptism of the holy ghost and it don't produce divine healing and deliverance that's a sad state to take the message that god sent us until it gets just something that is a well-oiled machine you know signed up but it won't go nowhere brother brandon said i was at a in a railroad yard and that was one of these new engines that was on display and it just had everything just so beautiful and shined and everything else and it was a prettiest thing and he said it was about like these churches you know that everything's in place and you know we got all the order and everything and every ah man was the prettiest and hollywood evangelism and all of this kind of stuff and and he says i looked at it and he walked through it and he said when's this thing going to move i'd like to take a little ride can it move he said no so why can't it move said there's no fire in the engine and he said that's what's the matter with the church today it's plushed up it's decorated up with no fire in the engine you can only move by fire what we need he said is some more holy ghost and fire [Applause] and that's what true that is what has happened too often we've accepted the tradition of easy believism the message of billy graham instead of the message to abraham that and that will send you right down into the tribulation period let me tell you something friends the pentecostal blessing ought to flow to the church we got a lot of intellectual preachers and teachers and where did they take us where did they take us we've got 60 years of kingdom building made personality cults you know i'm a paul and i'm a of apollos and i'm a christ and we you know all of these different things we build our little personality culture and paul said aren't you carnal and walk his men sure it's natural to like this preacher or that preacher what but that ain't spiritual amen and when we turn around and they make kingdom building and personality cults i tell you it's time we smash those idols [Applause] amen look at the folly of powerless group of people whose only weapon is argument you see there is no revival possible until jesus is welcomed back into the midst and the ministry and the people quit putting him out of their churches like a bunch of laodiceans then you have the other side you know all screaming hollering calling at the bride's revival when it's nothing but a bunch of man-made emotional workup you see that's where satan gets in to make it all mechanics or no dynamics i put uh put all dynamics and no mechanics is that right we got to bring it together one of it won't work hey man it's like you know i'm a farm boy so you know if i we had a bunch of chickens and some began to escape the the chicken panda that we had what we did is we just clipped one wing that's all you had to do if you clipped them both they could still fly over the fence but if you clip just one wing he'd just flop around in a circle he couldn't get off the ground amen god gives us two wings spirit and truth mechanics dynamics are you with me amen if you don't have any mechanics if the word ain't right you ain't gonna get off the ground amen if the spirit ain't right you're not getting off the ground you just flop around and around around and stay in your pen but if you can have both wings spirit and truth hallelujah dynamics and mechanics that's what it's going to be then you can man up with wings as an eagle and you can fly into the realms where all things are possible to them that believe [Applause] you see it's the word it's the word not creeds of two lords or some personality cult or not uh not a thunder of a bunch of noise with no lightning but the power of god on display we've had years of teachers now that claimed to be the aaron to the moses who needed to help brother branham say what he could not well they did they helped him say what he didn't amen they even helped him today say what he didn't and say well there's no preachers no more god didn't call him to preach you see they got to help him to say what he didn't say what he couldn't say you see again we've had to self-proclaim apostles who thought it was thought they were needed to bring clarity to the message again that this thought was needed to help brother branham say what he couldn't say so we need this personality cult leader to say what he couldn't say to do what he couldn't do and so again it's a revival killer that we have that we have want to be prophets that risen and they've invaded the pulpit without a true call from god style themselves as officials of men and say the gifted ministry of ephesians 4 is that god gave the church has failed so they're taking over men in the pulpit have never been called of god never been anointed to preach amen intellectual men that just get up you know and they got their speech to give and oh they can lay it out so beautiful in water it takes the anointing to break the yoke that's what we need in the pulpit is anointed preachers men on fire lit by the fire of god men who know their god who know their ministry is called to cast out devils that ought to be one of the number one thing in the church we are called to cast satan out cast him out of our young people cast him out of their marriages cast him out of our homes cast him out of our churches [Applause] they add here they take away there soon the message is no longer pure revival dies down oh we got to hear that voice of the spirit one voice amount he warned even paul don't you you can't change one word amen no you can't he said if i or an angel from heaven preach you any other gospel let him be accursed there's no hope for revival you see because you see because because of men they're adding to taken away from the word of god i'm not through with this yet but i just want to say i want to say to this there is hope for revival because god is hearing the cries the sign because of the bondage some of you that have been bound by pornography by demons of oppression with young people with suicide amen we will come on church and with spirits of insanity that are coming in amen with the spirits of adultery and fornication and every kind of evil spirit that wants to come and take a place in the church are you with me god is hearing the cry of what the devil is trying to do in message churches because there are men and women saying oh god we need a move of god we need the holy ghost we need a revival in our mess we need something real for our young people that they whip their way to calvary and our own people get a renewing of the holy ghost again and then it causes their feet to dance and their voice to be lifted up to shout amen in the holy spirit moving in the church one more time [Applause] god hears the sign of the cry but he's only waiting for people to call him into action amen i'm waiting by waiting for people to call on him when we hear a god that is still god like we heard last night a god that still heals a god that forgives a god that saves a god that delivers amen all that ought to know in our faith it ought to cause revival to rise on the inside and expectancy i'm expecting in god to move if he can do it for them he can do it for me if he healed cancer then he can heal he can heal it now hallelujah are you with me amen if we can reach out and bring a prodigal back home then they can bring it back now [Applause] wasn't too long ago we had a young girl come up in the prayer line and she was crying out to god for her brother said i want my brother who is lost he's living with a whirly girl living away from god and he just broke up our family and and we're j you know he said they're just tension in the home and all kinds of things come away my brother i wasn't saved so we prayed with her and there as we were praying with others in the prayer line before the prayer line was over that boy was laying in bed at home in his pajamas jumped out of his bed got in his car drove all the way to the church came into the house of god before that service is over god answered the prayer of a 16 year old girl who called on god for her brother that same god will answer your prayer you've been calling out for your children your brother your mother your sister that god will answer your prayer today he'll reach out he can reach down to the gutter boats and bring them out of sin and world and ungodliness he's a god he's a god that delivers a god that saves i'll tell you what we ought to do in meetings like this to get ready for a party hallelujah get ready for a party that's what we ought to do we ought to get ready for a celebration men women boys and girls that have been lost and out in sin they're coming back home we ought to get our dancing shoes on we got to have ourselves that our god is in our mess and he's doing something should anoint our faith hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] well brother tim we're in revival but our revival is the opening of the word brother tim well in wyolith a little bethlehem brother branham said we bypassed on creeds and drinking stagnated water from cisterns what we need today is an opening of the word that lives and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen i'll tell you i'm all far at the opening of the word but we need one that lives that brings back jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that gives our people hope [Applause] brother branham said life must not come out of just an intellectual revival it's got to come out of the bible a word revival and the word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you did in acts 2. that's an opening of the word that lives you get the same results as x2 [Applause] i'll tell you what we need to get our focus back we need to get our focus back on a living god amen bring it down to a place there where we can see the same things the apostles saw the same gospel they preached produce the same results that it produced for them that'll strike the target every time hallelujah a word that lives a word that is in focus and that word when it's in focus it'll do the same job for you it did for them either heal the sick it'll raise the dead it'll cast out devils it'll bring forth the glorious church hallelujah god hiding himself in simplicity he got to find something that will take his word we'll take the divine revelation and won't move with it we'll stay right there on the word that's the way he does it he's always done it that way so when men get so educated and so smart that he tries to put his own interpretation say well like they say baptism of the holy ghost they say oh that was for another day but if they don't well it wasn't for another day but i tell you it just don't come like it did on the day of pentecost we received the holy ghost when we believe and all kinds of stuff like that you see and then then others will go to seed on other quotes like you know this is not the day of pentecost for the repeat or return and i want to say that's true i don't deny that one bit this is not the day of pentecost instead it's the last stage this is not the repeat of pentecost pentecost was a seed that was planted and went down into the ground come on church this is the seed of the harvest and it's going to be taken into the garner [Applause] hallelujah so now it's not a repeat of pentecost we're not just starting all over again starting seven ages amen this is rapture rage it's a rapture day amen this is not not just a return to pentecost amen it's more than that [Applause] amen oh it's time to get out of the glares that have been and then the and in the midst of the darkness this dark time they're not the real light they're not the messenger choirs they're mirageous but oh i tell you friends you see that's where they live today in mirages of the times past the catholic church is living on his past reputation we were the first church look how far they moved from it look with their apology today of the sodomy and their in their pulpits in their priesthood look at their apologies of how we treated what we did how we enslaved what we did you see and and brother branham said to priests if you're all like the original church and you went after the doctrine of these men set up at nicaea why is it you haven't got the power they had back there at the beginning why don't you do the things that they did which jesus said or we've got more people now we live in a different age he said but the word doesn't change these signs shall follow them that believe heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never he said in the church when they obeyed what god said originally and the word of god look at the miracles and signs and so forth they had and you don't have them at all today it's the evidence god is not with you if he said that to the roman church he says that same thing to those today amen oh you know well but you know brother tim we we've seen our last sign and and and so you know there's just nothing more let me tell you you are god's last sign his last sign is a bride who is manifesting the son of man the word in this age you are god's last sign you're his last message to the last age you are the embodiment of the truth [Applause] amen amen now so as we just look at it we we know where we're at in time i want to just hurry hurry down for for just a moment there's so many things that we could speak about but brother branham said in the message investment the last thing that the church is going to see is christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls amen oh he says in the world falling apart the hour we're living oh god the world has fallen apart and there hangs in the hangars bombs or hangs things the things to do exactly the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because you see the church the word the bride is ministry christ his ministries and the bride which is body the supernatural spiritual body of his on the earth uh and his spirit in them living his life right out until him and the church becomes one for the wedding hallelujah so what do he said there will be a big outpouring of the spirit is there hope for revival the prophet said so there will be a big outpouring of the spirit we got bombs hanging in the hangars we got them with their name our names on it we are inside them just before the fire paws america has turned from lamb to dragon are you with me amen we're right here in the fulfillment of prophecy amen that what about the rest of it there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church take her into the skies [Music] [Applause] hallelujah again in 1964 he says this satan's big machine is up there is ready to move you ever seen it ready brother the dynamics is coming into that movement you're seeing things turn out that you never dreamed it's in our media is in the false narratives they tell they're lying to us everywhere we look [Music] immorality on the increase sodom on the rise you know where we're at amen there's no more hope who are you going to vote in who are you going to get that would turn things around bring it back to god you're not amen but he said that satan's big machine up there ready to move to christ down but remember god's little flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready too it's ready for the dynamics to set it a fire with the holy ghost fear not little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom the holy ghost will strike a little church that has come out from the world women that wears long hair nazarite to prove they've separated themselves from the world hallelujah amen the holy ghost will strike a church that's come out of the world little women that wears long hair nazarite amen as i quoted earlier you know he said there's still room at the table amen there's still there's still got to be one more somewhere we went home yet somebody helped me preach god's gonna send another shaking across the country where there's somebody still out there somewhere for that predestinated seed that the lights have fallen somewhere in the world amen now is there hope for revival in the message of token i'm looking for a time a break forth of the spirit of god in the last days when we're living for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for a rapture and faith just before it comes and everything is setting right straight in order for that and i believe we're now at the time that the word house should have preeminence what he say here another surge of the holy spirit amen he preaches perfect faith and he said i i'm trying to get the church into place where we can really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's laying right at the door we see it but we want more of it we wanted such a flow that it'll help to us and flow out to others hallelujah amen he tells us in three kinds of believer that's the reason i do believe when that bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that it takes such a baptism of the holy spirit and that bride that'll take her from the earth in a raptured grace hallelujah amen a sound from heaven that takes such a baptism of the holy ghost into that bride take her from the earth and the glory amen what do you say the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost that we worked in a small measure but the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up and bring all the dead in christ from thousands of years hallelujah amen he'd stand an invisible union of the bride and he would prophesy and he said it's on the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord hallelujah revival's over for the church revival's over for america come on somebody the divine healing movement is over azusa street my healing is over but the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord hallelujah just saith the lord never fails [Applause] one of the things that brother branham in the end of his ministry labored on he actually would do this starting with his own church he had he had a thought that he waved back and forth in fact there were several of them maybe sunday morning i'll get into some of the others but there's two thoughts brother branham will interwove back and forth one was was one thought was contained and be not afraid testimony on the sea go away jesus and others that dealt with where the disciples were between revivals and the testifying of the past and yet had gone without jesus and the other thought of course was the one of samson crying once more lord and brother branham preached the sermon on samson as the present state of the church as a deceived church by the world and warned his own church of being blinded and defeated and scared of the new birth the thought of samson was not just something he preached to the pentecostals he knew he could not revive azusa street but he preached it first at brenham tabernacle and he took samson and showed him as a deceived church by the world and and there as he explained it and he said you know the the people the reason they go and join organizations and substitute a handshake instead of new birth they're trying to bypass the new birth they don't want the new birth we know it's taught in the bible so we want to substitute something and the pentecostal people are just so bad trying to substitute something they want it in class it's got so classy we'll just shake hands and join the church and be sprinkled and baptized and they're afraid of the new birth and he says i'm sometimes believed that branham tabernacle's getting afraid of it so this wasn't something he was just concerned about them out there he was concerned about his own church getting afraid of the new birth and he talked about a birth and he said a birth is a mess no matter where it's at if it's in a pink decorated hospital room or whether it's there in a shuck pile it's a mess hey man he said a new birth is nothing more than a mess but people get so starchy we'll go over where they just shake hands i mean you believe god sent a prophet god bless you then you've got the holy ghost you believe in serpent seed and predestination and malachi 4 and you've got the holy ghost you see they don't want a mess we want it's so classy you know just believe this doctrine we have the truth not just so you know do you believe that yes well then you've got it and can't live overcoming lives still in every kind of sin and ungodliness listen let me let me tell you something you i i'm i'm i i meet with you and especially in the youth camps i meet with devils demons that have actually taken on the young people i had a girl coming to a print to the prayer line here some years ago now and then and there's a moment i anointed with all its chains and crouched down begin to growl and there and see my face become grotesque and she began to swat at me like hitting at me like testing like an animal and growling i won't come out i won't come out i won't come out it did it did it had to it had to bow to the name of jesus christ these sons have followed them that believe in my name they will cast out devils i asked a girl later i said where did that devil come into you at she said it wasn't things i actually did it was things that i looked at and it was my imagination you see it was pornography and it come in through the eye gate and entered right down into her until she was so demon possessed when she was anointed with oil he come out and it used her voice because it was used in her mind and spirits are entered into people demon possessed [Music] i have to say she would hit at me right there it would just it i'd feel like wind blood and blow my clothes but she can never make a connection a full wall of fire about me i have nothing now to fear hallelujah all hail the power of jesus name even demons and the angels had to prostrate fall amen he's lord of lords and king of kings amen and i've seen it happen time and time and time again in one of our youth camps we had over to over what was a ten or a dozen and about ten did not demonic manifestations that manifest itself just that way writhing on the floor speaking out and calling out i won't come out and all kinds of things that was happening what is happening demons are taking over people evil spirits getting a hold of them but i'll tell you what the doctors don't have a cure for it they can just dupe you down but i tell you something we got something better than dope it'll give you a new mind it'll give you a new heart it'll give you a new spirit it'll put god's holy spirit on the inside of you hallelujah but we don't want a birth that's a mess but he said the new birth is nothing less than a mess and people get so starchy we'll go to a place where they shake hands we'll go over where they don't bawl and cry and beat on an altar and cry out he said you want to be too human what we need is a birth to dine out amen that's exactly what you need if you want to be born again you got to die first amen the holy spirit is not going to live in there with that demon that you cannot serve two masters there has to be a dying out and rejecting of that king that was upon the throne of your heart that you were born with because of your natural birth but when you get born again that king is dethroned and cast out and you get a new king on the inside of you [Applause] and then those members that used to serve the former king to smoke and drank and committed adultery and looked at the wrong thing now those members are yielded to the holy ghost and you raise up holy hands unto god and you shout and you rejoice and you declare the name of the lord and you live right and talk right and act right come on church brother branham told us that an old seed potato it has to rot in order for a new life to come he said the corn can't produce until the seed is rotten and that life comes up out of it and he says he said a man or woman can never have a new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is dead and rotten and die out at the altar and scream and get all messed up to a place the starch gets out of your collar and you're born again by the spirit of god and he said i don't care if you squall speak in tongues jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life [Applause] amen oh my notice altar he mentions altar here twice there hasn't been an altar called in many places for years oh we don't do that oh you know no no no brother tim we we don't do that no more oh brother branham didn't even do it that's a lie here's one of his last sermons he said i i want an old-fashioned altar call god still moves in them in jehovah jiren 64 i believe god's going to do some great things tomorrow i know i'm hoping he is that's the reason i can make altar calls do everything i can to find favor with him oh he says in testimony on the sea we've gone off without old-time prayer meetings and baptism of the holy ghost coming down until the fire is burnt blow you can cry out and try to get people to the altar and they just walk up like they're almost dead a dread to come then ask ministers to come pray with them and they say oh what did you ask me for and they get down you can't hardly get them and then and and and stand there just for a few minutes and look at you and go back and sit in their seats to me the fire is going out something has happened look what we need is revival that sinners looking up on christ repent run to the altar with their hands up screaming for mercy and the whole church is a flame of fire with the glory of god amen i mean listen i i said i'm a farm boy i i learned early years you know when the chicken was pepping out of the shell you didn't help that little boy out you you let him pick his way out amen we want to make it easy for them you just come and shake your hand say god sent a prophet say well i believe the message you know you've got the baptism all the holy ghost you're ruining them you feel you pull that cell over that chick and he'll die hey man he's got to peck his way out amen if some people need to beat on the altar and pack their way out and say god i need a real infilling of the holy ghost god i need to die out to sin and not believe in this darkness that holds my life let them pick their way out until they break forth with new life hallelujah don't take long friends when you start pecking there you get a little breath of fresh air hey man there's the atmosphere of another world amen the more you feel it they man you prickly make it a little bigger and a little more breeze comes in you make it a little bigger until all the shell is broke away from you and you come out into new life hallelujah that's what we need we don't need to help them out we need a dying out to sin and die out to unbelief you pull him out of this shell he won't live he's got to come god's way hey amen the eagle's got to pip his way out of the shell amen you got a peck and you got to knock on it you got to say god made me a promise he said he'd give me the baptism of the holy ghost and i'm going to get it the promise is unto me to my children to them that are far off no matter how far you stray even as many as the lord our god shall call amen we're going to peck at it until it opens up to the windows of heaven and the atmosphere of the holy ghost comes down and we come out of her shell first thing you know you'll be able to flop your wings a little bit hallelujah pick your eye way out blaspheme thus saith the lord thus saith the lord let's say i can't have a revival i can have one in myself the church is dying but i don't have to die with it amen amen i can be born again by the holy ghost amen there's so many that don't want to mess you know they they just want it an easy way you know brother branham told us there's no way for a baby to get it unless he cries for it said that's god's provided way people are afraid of the new birth he said they're they're afraid he said you take it out yonder in a pig pen a burst makes a mess if it's a cow stable if it's a pink decorated hospital it's a mess you might cry boo hoo rub around the altar no matter what you do i never ask god it won't do no good to try to bring the new birth to my level i want to meet god on god's level of the new birth and receive it i don't care what i have to do someone said not long ago i'm afraid to receive the holy ghost i'm afraid it might make me speak in tongues like them others i don't care if i spoke in tongues talked in tongues crowed in tongues or anything else i want the holy ghost [Applause] i don't care what level it is i want god on his level amen something that changes your desires and your attitudes not intellectual speakers not great theology but the power of god how long does a baby cry till he's satisfied [Applause] amen come on you cry until you're satisfied you knock until it opens you're seeking do you find it you ask until you receive it you don't give up on it i must have it i gotta get to jesus amen i come to this meeting and i gotta get to him i can't go back with the same old burdens i've had [Applause] hallelujah you'll fight for every inch of it but peck your way through until the life comes amen amen what should it be brother branham taught is there ought to be personal workers spirit-filled people and he says i went to places and people supposed to be spirit-filled people and see altar calls me you couldn't even get people to go in with anybody to pray with them it shows that ichabod the spirit of god is departed but when you see that seal and fire and longing and long for human souls now you remember samson he was raised up to destroy the enemy is that right we have been raised up to destroy the enemy we have been raised up to destroy the laodicea and the evil spirit in this last day and be an overcomer [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we have been given a covenant with god you know he had those seven locks back there it was the secret of his hidden power is that right amen and seven locks there that he had nazarite vow that he had unto the lord and there when trouble came he could just reach back and feel those seven locks god you've moved through seven spirits to seven ages to seven messengers of seven churches and i know you're right here in this last age [Applause] hallelujah so when i feel that confidence there i know lord you're fixing to do something i'm surrounded it looks like i'm surrounded but i'm surrounded by you there may be a thousand fall on this side or third ten thousand on this but it'll not connive me i was born to defeat the enemy that's what the church was they were born to be serpent bruisers and devil defeaters and overcomers god raised you up for that purpose he ordained you for that reason amen he empowered you with a hidden power on the inside of you amen amen oh my you know peter took that jawbone of an ass there and struck those helmets that would have shattered into a thousand pieces but god got in that jawbone amen he stood there there as long as he could reach back and feel those seven locks god's covenant and then jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you let the fire in that first stage it lit the necks and lit the necks and lit the night and we got the same fire that was on the day of pentecost hallelujah amen nothing should bother the church as long as we can feel the holy ghost the covenant of god's word the works that i do shall you do also greater than these shall you do amen for i go into the father and that's the father sent me so send i you how did that happen the father that sent him went in him and when he sends you he comes in you so greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world are you with me church amen but oh what happened let a delilah shave his power and i wonder today if that isn't repeated remember he was preaching this to his own church if we're not seeing it very that very thing happened the power has been shaved off by personality cults by hybriding the message by forgetting his power by taking an easy believism rather than a new true new birth experience somebody with me [Music] until it saves the glory off the church amen i i remember i remember in one of our meetings there we had a young girl her name is mariah pruitt she's my great niece and she was there she went to the doctor because she started losing her hair they pronounced her with alopecia it was a a an autoimmune disease that attacked every hair follicle on her body they told her she will lose all her hair it will never come back it is incurable we have nothing to treat it with get you get used to living with it you will lose every bit of hair on your body your eyelashes your your eyebrows your hair everything and all of this went and she was in that condition one service i was preaching and i looked out there and i said you know i i was preaching i was preaching about the glory of god and it being in the church and how the hair is a woman's glory and all that and i looked out there and i said and there's a young girl right there 11 years old the devil has robbed her glory amen and i said i'll tell you what we're not going to allow that to happen god gave that glory and we're not going to allow that to happen bring that girl up here we brought and prayed with her faith began to come in her heart right there then then a little bit later at youth camp here she comes at the prayer line and here she comes with three little bobby pins in her hands [Applause] she comes up to the front she said i want to be able to wear these in my hair amen we laid hands upon her and prayed for her through that prayer line and her hair began to grow through her body wasn't my family camp there it was it was about that long and then it just began to grow until it's way down and when i'm going home i'm going to marry her to a young man she's a beautiful girl there with beautiful hair god restored her glory hallelujah but if god will do that for a little girl what will god do for his church he will restore the glory of this church i don't care what has been brother branham said is there any hope for revival left he said oh yes there is hope for revival he said there while samson was in prison there was a new crop that was crawling out and he said i believe there's a new crop today hallelujah they will have the glory of god that can reach back there and say he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still healed he's still delivered he's still saved but he said they're going to have to be a people that's willing to die out to the world they're gonna have to say let me die amen let me die out to sin let me die out to unbelief let me die just once more lord and brother branham went through preaching all around and he began something that he preached all over the place just once more lord and i'm telling you tonight that's still his message amen just once more lord amen somebody can reach out and say lord i i can feel your power i can be feeling begin to move and every fiber of my bed [Music] there is hope for revival just once more lord but let me die out and believe let me die out to sin let me die out on

i'd say oh god bring a change in me [Music] from glory to glory as we view you your precious word change me lord change me let there come an atmosphere again in the church [Music] where the sick don't lie sick and go back home sick but an atmosphere of faith when the sick comes here they're healed an atmosphere of faith when the loss comes they can find salvation an atmosphere of welcoming in the church that's willing to have a celebration and a party [Music] that's willing to welcome home the prodigal so come out back [Music] i was talking to a man this week he said brother tim i've wasted 20 years of my life 20 years just went down the drain so when you was in israel you took a picture of there the sea of galilee and some of the place and you sent it to me i got those pictures and i looked at it and i wrote you back brother tim i'd sure like to see that place i said you can come on back home [Music] he said those words saying come on back home struck me down in my heart and i began to move back toward home [Music] hey man there's a new jerusalem forest there's a city whose builder maker is god oh man you don't have to stay out there wondering come on back home he'll take you to that city he'll take you there that city where there's theophanies where we never grow old there's no sickness no pain no sorrow of death and those in theophany come here and we in flesh meet our theophany and we're changed from mortal to immortality [Music] but that change starts right here at the altar at the altar of your heart is not so important this altar but for you to find a real replace of repentance in your heart while your head's about just for a moment [Music] your thoughts on him [Music] you just be in prayer just for a moment [Music] but as there could be maybe a prodigal here maybe someone in australia you got that old cold virus of that laodicean spirit [Music] something that's taken you out of the company of saints took you away from christ [Music] we just just raise our hand real high so i can see it and say jesus jesus i need you i need you i need you pass my my way i gotta have you maybe there's some of you would say brother tim i've got a prodigal in mind it's my son it's my daughter it's my is my child it's my husband it's my wife let's listen to that one lord [Music] i want to reach out to you lord right now [Music] i want to reach out right now for that one maybe you could be like that girl that could say i want my brother saved [Music] i want him to come back home that same god that did it for justin ware and he's still serving god today that was eight years ago he's still god he can go right out to yours find him may not come in his pajamas to church like that boy did that night but he'll come he'll come god's got his own way of getting them they'll come all that the father has given me will come hallelujah look to him right now and say lord we need salvation in the house of god we need deliverance lord father in the name of jesus every hand was raised to you ever backs in slit and soul ever person lord away from you ever ever won lord that sincerely reached out towards you they was not reaching to me i'm just a mere mortal what could i do but you're one moment in your presence you can change your life lord you know we're that struggling boy that struggling girl that that husband that wife that whatever sister that brother whatever it is that grandfather grandmother and mother dad god you see them you know where they are tender their hearts lord let there be such a revival of the holy spirit in us that when we get around them is such an atmosphere of god they long to be like us move lord move for your people and i pray o god that once more lord let us feel your power once more move to this church once more let the holy spirit move oh god in the hallelujah's role and the thank you jesus and healings come and deliverance come salvation come all in the name of jesus satan you bound god's people long enough and as a servant of the living god i call for you to leave them now in the name of jesus christ those that have been bound may they be liberated by the holy spirit right now in jesus name hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord thank you jesus just begin to thank him right now just begin to thank him he dwells in the praises of his people he's beginning to worship in this moment amen in his presence in fullness of joy is there hope a revival yes you can have revival you can have a fresh anointing you can go out with a new power amen a new assurance an overcoming power to live about the world in sin and unbelief hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord thank you lord brother branham would encourage us to cry out just once more lord why don't you do it tonight from the depths of your heart lord just once more once more as soon as i had the revival the divine healing move out in the revival we've had a word of revival but lord i need a revival let the revival start in me lord let there be a renewing of the holy ghost amen let there be a pentecostal fire built up on the inside of me till i see you the same yesterday today and forever i repent of my bitterness my unforgiveness i repent of my lethargy my my lukewarmness i repent of it all and i give you preeminence tonight i must have that revival i must have it in my heart i must have it in my life amen thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you lord praise the name of the lord [Music] oh [Music] your face is all i see for when your eyes are on this child your grace oh lord please light the fire [Music] [Music] fear [Music] your face is [Music] your grace abounds in me and i want to take your word and shine it all around but first help me just to live it lord and when i'm doing well help me never seek a crown for my reward is giving glory to you your face is all i see for when your eyes [Music] [Music] burn bright and clean renew the lamp of my first love that bird with [Music] your face is all i see and for when your [Music] eyes are on this child your grace abounds in me [Music] i believe it was in 1964 brother branham would say i'm not looking for a revival but i'm looking for the rapture and we could take that out of context because it's going to take a revival to bring on a rapture not a revival like the world may think a revival would be with a lot of shouting and a lot of different things but a deep revival a knowledge of god that you've met with god that you know that you've died out that there's something in you that's different it moves you friends it's not just a church revival it's a personal revival it's a revival that you take home with you it's a revival on monday morning when you get on your knees and you open the book and lord there's a day ahead of me today now lord let me live for you today and i'll tell you what that's the revival that we're looking for and when we all come that way to church then you'll see a revival that will make a difference in our services that'll make a difference in the way we worship that'll bring a a passion back into it that'll bring an expectation how many of you would say i i desire that and and if you're honest and say was there a time i was closer to god than i am today and i think brother brown i mean what house will you build me we quoted this yesterday oh for that feeling i had when i first was saved [Music] friends that's the thing that we need when god is walking with you yeah we'll have our ups and our downs we'll have our trials but i'll say this when you're walking with him and and the birds sound different and and and and the world doesn't have the allure and the attraction you're not halfway in you're not halfway out but you're walking with him when his power flows through you when his words come through you when it's him doing all of these things that's the revival so the question is there a hope for a revival how many would say there is how many knows we've got something to do we heard it many times just die out we need to die out why don't we present ourselves to the lord tonight not not just a workup of a revival a prophet would tell us very clearly that the there's a way and there's a highway there's a highway and a way and down the middle is the way you go to one side you become intellectual you come to the other side you become emotional but the real gospel is right down the middle amen oh lord take these hands make yourself a sacrifice tonight just as we'll just sing a course or two but let's sing this and let's say lord i'm giving myself to you take these hands and lift them up for i have not the strength [Music] [Applause] [Music] i have nothing [Applause] [Music] without you take my voice it out let it sing the songs of mercy i have found for i have nothing i have nothing without you oh let's worship the lord my soul all it needs is all your love to cover me so all the world [Applause] will see that i have nothing [Music] without you [Music] take my body build it up may it be broken as an offering of love i have nothing i have nothing [Applause] without you [Music] take my time here on this earth let it glorify for i have nothing i have nothing without you all my soul all my soul needs is all your love to cover me [Applause] so all the world we'll see that i have nothing [Applause] without [Music] and all my soul all my soul needs it's all your love or just to cover me so that all the world will see that i'm have nothing without you amen as you're playing softly as we just bow our heads the early disciples were very distinguished they took notice that they'd been with jesus brother branham would talk about an amish woman that he met in a meeting one time him and sister mita and he said did you see her her spirit was clean it was clear she'd been somewhere friends do you want to be there how many are tired of the world how many are tired of having your foot in the world halfway and halfway in church when you get sick and tired of it and you say lord all i want is you i believe he'll meet you right there how did some of these demon possessions happen because they just opened up to how does christ come in when you die out to those things and say lord i don't want that i don't want the world i want you [Music] i don't know how many of you were praying you come here we rub shoulders with the world we get scarred we get cold we get indifferent oh we need a refilling of the holy ghost i need a refilling it's not good enough to have it a week ago two weeks ago we're living in a time where you need it every day there has to be a fountain it's open just lingering a few moments we're going to dismiss you stay in this atmosphere allow god to minister to you so your heads are bowed and if you're just hungry you're hungry for the lord i believe he'll meet you we need friends the revival starts at the altar of our heart you might come to the altar here but sometimes you come out of guilt sometimes you come out of conscience but why don't you right where you're seated right where you're standing right now actually where you're standing lord here's my heart it's open i just want to be honest nobody's even hearing me i'm tired of where i was this last week i'm tired of these demons that would oppress me i'm tired of just a lukewarm life is there a hope yes there's a hope i believe we're here for a purpose god's called us out [Music] i'm going to let's just sing as the deer pantheth after the water brook and i'm going to ask brother kelly hildebrand if you'll come and close in prayer after we sing this [Music] is [Music] desire and i long to worship thee [Music] [Music] does [Music] desire [Applause] [Music] you're my friend and you are my brother even though you are [Music] want you more than the other so much more than ever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] to you [Music] the desire and i loved god bless you certainly is wonderful to be in the house of the lord today and it really strikes my heart how we need to have our our candles and our oil just a little fuller we can never turn up our cups enough we need to keep them up every day and say lord feel me every moment of the day and may the holy spirit be with us very all the time i just arrived home from brazil on tuesday we had wonderful meetings in the trans-amazonias region they have radio broadcasts that we work together with them with that go out into the tributarians and off of the amazon river and over the last five or six years they've baptized over a thousand people out of that region and god is really doing and moving and there's a real revival amongst those people right now and we don't know when the last one's gonna come in but we do know one thing one day the last one will come in and what a glorious time it's going to be amen let's just look to the lord lord jesus what a wonderful atmosphere that is here today lord and father what a challenge it is to each one of us lord to have our fire just burning a little brighter lord lord sometimes our wicks get crusty lorne today lord we had wick trimming time and the globes were pulled off and they were polished lord lord that our light would burn just a little brighter we thank you father for this service that we've had and i pray father you would restore the strength of our brother tim pruitt and lord each one of us lord that are here lord may we go with renewed strength lord renewed love for one another lord and we pray father as the meetings would continue lord that it would just intensify lord and may the power of the living god may have moved lord from heart to heart and soul the soul and may every person lord come that has come here lord may they leave father with what they have desired to have within their heart blessed brother ed bless this assembly lord we commit the service unto you now for the glory of jesus christ in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen we have a full day tomorrow so we're going to dismiss you today i want to just say i believe god's just preparing our hearts for what he has yet and tomorrow there'll be a youth meeting here in the afternoon their brother timothy just come expecting god to do something and tomorrow night our brother ron is coming and i just want to say god has shown to brother ron that he needed to be here at this time and god was going to do something and i want us to set our hearts and we're going to move to a time of prayer and whether that be in the form of a prayer line but i want us to come not just as a form if that's the way the lord leads us but i want us to come with a sincerity and a reverence of heart knowing that you have confessed your sins knowing that you're sincere before god and i believe god will hear your prayer god has spoken to our brother ron specifically even just a few weeks ago and you're sharing some things so i i want you to be in prayer i believe god's going to move in our midst amen well let's just sing a little change in order oh christian soldier pick up your weapon [Music] we're not alone for the angels have camped around us and we're not defeated we'll soon be home oh christian soldier pick up your
