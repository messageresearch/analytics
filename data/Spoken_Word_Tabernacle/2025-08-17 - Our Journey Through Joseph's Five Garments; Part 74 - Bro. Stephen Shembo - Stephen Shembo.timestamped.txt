[0:42] [Music]
[1:46] Oh Lord

[1:54] When I

[4:32] [Music]
[4:34] When I look down

[11:16] Almighty God.
[11:20] Lord, that song comes close, Lord, to
[11:22] what we would like to express this
[11:24] morning, Lord, because Lord, these are
[11:27] these are words, Lord, that a man wrote
[11:30] in a song, Lord, but our hearts cannot
[11:32] find words, Lord, to express, Lord, the
[11:36] love and the gratitude we have for you,
[11:38] Lord, for where you've brought us to,
[11:40] Lord God.
[11:44] But you are great, Lord. There's none
[11:45] other like you at all. Lord God,
[11:49] we come into your house this morning,
[11:51] Lord.
[11:53] First of all, Lord, thanking you,
[11:54] Father.
[11:56] We come to worship your name, Lord. We
[11:58] come to praise your name, Lord. We come
[12:00] to lift your name up and exalt you,
[12:02] Lord, above everything in heaven and on
[12:04] earth. Lord,
[12:07] we ask that you come and have your will
[12:08] once again, Lord God, in our lives for
[12:11] the message, Lord, of the hour that
[12:12] you've given us, Lord. how thankful we
[12:15] are, Lord God, for this. No doubt this
[12:17] same song is probably being sung in
[12:20] denominational churches around the world
[12:22] this morning, Lord God. But Lord, it's
[12:25] special to us, Lord.
[12:27] It's special, Lord, because you've
[12:30] opened the book up to us, Lord. The
[12:32] seven seals and the thunders, Lord, have
[12:34] all been sounded, Lord. And we're
[12:36] thankful, Father, that we've received
[12:37] these things, Lord. Lord, if there's
[12:40] anyone that's struggling with anything,
[12:42] Lord, open their eyes this morning, Lord
[12:44] God, and let them see. Let them see with
[12:47] new sight, Lord, that which you've done
[12:49] for us, Lord. We thank you, Father. We
[12:52] thank you, Lord.
[12:55] Bless our musicians this morning, Lord
[12:57] God. Bless our singers, Lord. Our
[13:01] technicians this morning, Lord God.
[13:03] Bless our deacons, Lord, our trustee,
[13:05] our treasurer, Lord, all the officers,
[13:07] Lord. come and bless your congregation
[13:10] this morning, Lord God. It's good to
[13:13] see, Lord, those that are coming in,
[13:14] Lord, be with those that are still on
[13:17] the road, Lord. We understand there was
[13:19] an accident in someone's path, Lord, but
[13:22] they made it, Lord. And that's We thank
[13:25] you, Father. We thank you,
[13:28] Lord. But I want to ask Lord God,
[13:32] Lord, if I'm guilty of
[13:35] some kind of a time complex that's being
[13:38] put on the pastor, Lord,
[13:41] we don't need to be under a time limit
[13:43] here, Lord God.
[13:45] We don't need for him to stand behind
[13:47] this desk, Lord, and to feel pressure,
[13:51] Lord, that he needs to shut it down
[13:53] before you finish what you have to say,
[13:55] Lord God.
[13:57] So we want to yield ourselves, Lord,
[13:59] individually and as a congregation,
[14:01] Lord, to let you and him have your
[14:06] liberty, Lord God. That's what we're
[14:08] here for. It doesn't matter, Lord, if
[14:10] we're here till 4 or 5:00, Lord God. We
[14:14] got nothing better to do and no place to
[14:16] be, Lord.
[14:19] Some of us could stand missing a meal
[14:21] anyway. Amen. Praise God. I know I
[14:25] could, Lord. I'm just asking for help,
[14:27] Lord. So, keep that devil off of us,
[14:31] Lord. We don't want it to come up here,
[14:33] Lord, and get on our pastor, Lord. Lord,
[14:36] the gift that you've given us deserves
[14:38] time to express itself, Lord.
[14:42] For we know it's not him, Lord. It's the
[14:44] Holy Spirit.
[14:48] So strengthen him before he even comes
[14:50] out here, Lord, to withstand anything
[14:53] that might come against this pulpit,
[14:55] Lord, while he's preaching.
[14:59] We just
[15:01] sometimes need to leave the doors open
[15:03] so those demons can leave.
[15:08] Bless your congregation this morning,
[15:10] Lord God. We're going to sing some
[15:12] songs, Lord. Some about the rapture,
[15:15] Lord. That's what's on our heart, Lord,
[15:17] is getting out of here.
[15:20] So bless each one here, Lord. These are
[15:22] precious souls, Lord God, sitting here.
[15:26] We've endured quite a bit in our lives
[15:28] for the gospel's sake, but not for our
[15:32] reward, Lord, for your glory.
[15:36] It's as simple as that.
[15:38] We thank you for opening our eyes, Lord.
[15:41] We're asking for an extraordinary
[15:43] service this morning, Lord. a
[15:45] supernatural service, a supernatural
[15:48] vindication this morning. Lord,
[15:52] may your power come down.
[15:55] We realize we're living in the days of
[15:57] the spoken word, Lord. We need to be
[15:59] careful what comes out of our mouths,
[16:01] good or bad, Lord. We are in that time,
[16:05] Lord. And we need to be responsible for
[16:08] those things that you've showed us,
[16:09] Lord, and be wise, Lord, and careful,
[16:13] Lord.
[16:15] to give you glory and not to bring
[16:18] reproach as well. Lord, we thank you,
[16:20] Father.
[16:22] Bless each one once again. Bless our
[16:24] pastor, Lord. Please meet with him while
[16:26] we sing, Lord, in the front. Lord, we
[16:29] thank you for what you're doing here
[16:31] with the building. Lord, we just ask
[16:34] that you continue to have your will,
[16:36] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name, we ask all
[16:39] these things, Lord. Amen and amen and
[16:42] amen.
[16:43] Praise God. Let's give him a clap
[16:45] offering this morning. Can we do that?
[16:49] Turn around and greet your neighbor.
[16:51] Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[16:54] Amen.
[17:07] Very
[17:11] good.
[17:17] [Music]
[17:39] Well, this world is not my home. I'm
[17:42] just a passing fruit. My treasures are
[17:46] laid up somewhere beyond the blue. But
[17:50] the angels begging me from heaven's open
[17:55] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[17:59] world anymore.
[18:03] Well, oh Lord, you know I have no friend
[18:07] like you. If heaven's not my home, then
[18:12] Lord, what will I do? Well, he ain't so
[18:15] thanking me from heaven's open door. And
[18:20] I can't feel at home in this world
[18:24] anymore.
[18:25] [Music]
[18:27] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[18:31] thing I know. Well, I fixed it up with
[18:35] Jesus so many years ago. And I know
[18:40] he'll see me through. Oh, I am weak and
[18:43] poor. And I can't feel at home in this
[18:48] world anymore.
[18:50] [Music]
[18:52] So Lord, you know I have no friend like
[18:57] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[19:01] what will I do? Well, the angels don't
[19:05] be back in me from heaven's open door.
[19:09] And I can't feel I in this world
[19:13] anymore.
[19:17] Just over in that glory land will live
[19:21] eternally.
[19:22] The saints on every hand are shouting
[19:26] victory
[19:28] for their songs of sweetest praise
[19:32] back from heaven shore. And I can't feel
[19:36] at all in this world anymore.
[19:41] Now, oh Lord, you know I have no friend
[19:46] like you. If heaven's not my home, then
[19:51] Lord, what will I do? Well, the angels
[19:54] beckon me from heaven's open door. And I
[19:59] can't feel at home in this world
[20:03] anymore.
[20:06] Well, some glad morning we shall see.
[20:10] Jesus in the air,
[20:13] coming after you and me. Joy is ours to
[20:17] share.
[20:18] What rejoicing there will be when the
[20:22] saints shall rise
[20:24] headed for that jubilee
[20:27] thunder in the sky.
[20:30] Oh singing and all shouting
[20:36] on that happy morning when we all shall
[20:41] rise.
[20:42] Oh what glory
[20:45] hallelujah.
[20:48] Win our blessed savior in the sky.
[20:55] Seems that now I almost see all the
[20:59] savior there
[21:01] rising for that jubilee that is just a
[21:05] hand
[21:07] in the twinkling of an eye change with
[21:11] them to be.
[21:13] All the living saints comply to that
[21:16] jubilee.
[21:19] Oh, what singing and no one shouting
[21:24] on that happy morning when we all shall
[21:29] rise.
[21:30] Oh, what glory.
[21:33] Hallelujah.

[21:36] When we meet our blessed savior in the
[21:40] sky.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Now when with all that heavenly host we
[21:46] begin to sing.
[21:49] Singing in the Holy Ghost how the
[21:52] heavens will rain.
[21:55] Millions there will join the song. With
[21:58] them we shall be
[22:01] praising Christ through ages long.
[22:04] Heaven's jubilee.
[22:07] Oh no singing and no one shouting
[22:12] on that happy morning when we all shall
[22:17] rise.
[22:18] Oh what glory
[22:21] hallelujah
[22:24] when we meet our blessed savior in the
[22:28] skies.
[22:30] No one singing and no one shouting
[22:36] on that happy morning when we all shall
[22:40] rise.
[22:42] Oh what glory
[22:45] hallelujah
[22:47] when we meet our blessed savior in the
[22:52] sky.
[22:53] [Music]
[22:56] Woo. Can y'all imagine?
[22:59] Can y'all imagine that?
[23:02] Hallelujah.
[23:03] [Music]
[23:05] You know, we're still in mortal bodies
[23:06] and we singing and it feels good to sing
[23:09] for God like this.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine?
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[23:14] [Music]
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him
[23:20] look upon
[23:22] &gt;&gt; that beautiful, wonderful face
[23:27] there.
[23:28] to sing forever
[23:34] of that amazing
[23:36] grace
[23:40] &gt;&gt; on the streets of glory.
[23:47] Let me lift my voice.
[23:52] [Music]

[23:58] [Applause]
[24:00] ever to rejoice.

[50:33] I know we are
[50:36] in uh
[50:38] in the time where our privacy
[50:42] uh lesson are going on. Our notions of
[50:45] privacy are going on. People are taking
[50:48] pictures in the uh bathroom, pictures in
[50:52] the living room, picture in the bedroom.
[50:56] We take picture everywhere and we post
[50:58] it everywhere. So refrain from taking

[51:14] stuff and go post it. That's against the
[51:17] privacy of the church.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[51:22] say, "No, I'm going to show my friend
[51:23] how our song leader uh office look
[51:26] like." Uhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhuh. Uhuh.
[51:28] Please don't do that. Don't go record.
[51:30] Uh post your own uh house.
[51:34] This is the house of the Lord.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Post yourself. Your own
[51:41] house, your own car. No problem. That's
[51:43] you and the Lord. But now go there and
[51:46] start uh I mean uh recording our sink
[51:50] and record. Hey, please.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; If you work here, just avoid that. If
[51:57] you are here part of the church, just
[51:59] avoid that. You can see fine, but I'm
[52:02] not somebody to be taking pictures and
[52:04] posting that online and everybody see
[52:07] that. I don't believe in that. That's
[52:08] just me. I don't believe in that. So,
[52:11] respect the privacy of the church.
[52:12] That's why I tell the camera I focus on
[52:15] here and leave the congregation alone.
[52:18] If you want to see who's in spoken word,
[52:19] you travel. You come here and you come
[52:22] and see the people of spoken word. Amen.
[52:26] Amen. Yeah, I've seen churches where
[52:29] camera going in the congregation and
[52:31] sometimes somebody's uh uh slumbering
[52:34] and uh and uh sleeping and everything
[52:38] and you see people on a big screen.
[52:41] Come on. So, let's let's avoid that one.
[52:44] Let's focus right here and deal with
[52:46] what is going on there. Let's keep the
[52:48] privacy of the church. Somebody asked
[52:50] the meeting about the married couple
[52:52] meetings and the other meeting. It's
[52:54] hard for me to put them online because
[52:57] of the way the setting and the way we
[52:59] approached them. It was married people.
[53:01] We took all the gloves off. We sat down
[53:05] and talk plainly. So I cannot take it
[53:08] and put it online. I know how message
[53:10] believer are and I know how many gun
[53:13] turn toward me because they're looking
[53:15] for one thing and then they shoot. So I
[53:18] cannot give you an opportunity to say
[53:20] well that meeting was supposed to be
[53:22] private and why did you put it on
[53:24] YouTube? I already know all of that.
[53:25] That's why I don't put it on YouTube.
[53:27] I've been in the message a little bit
[53:28] around. Amen. So you want to see the
[53:30] meeting? Pray God to give you a visa,
[53:33] travel over here and we meet one
[53:35] another. We sit we will put the meeting
[53:37] together and everything will be okay.
[53:40] Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Have I say something wrong?
[53:43] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. because I don't want to see
[53:47] faces going on now. I know what I'm
[53:49] talking about. You can say I'm sorry,
[53:52] but the video is already there.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Uh you can tell me I'm sorry, brother
[53:56] Steven. I didn't know, but the video is
[53:58] already there. And whoever put it, if
[54:00] they don't want to remove it, it's going
[54:02] to stay there. So I know message
[54:04] believer. I've been around message
[54:06] believer. I study message believer. So I
[54:09] know how it is. So you want to come in
[54:10] the meeting, let us know. Come talk to
[54:13] your pastor. Come. welcome to the
[54:15] meeting. We can share with you but
[54:17] certain things it's hard unless if I'm
[54:20] say there is a convention for married
[54:22] couple meeting I need to talk to
[54:23] everybody then I'm using a different
[54:26] weapon and to know what I'm doing
[54:28] because every time you're trying to help
[54:30] people they will you will see one who's
[54:32] trying to to block the blessing and try
[54:35] to come in a legalistic way and usually
[54:37] they the one that struggle
[54:40] &gt;&gt; that's right
[54:41] &gt;&gt; and they don't want to be disclosed.
[54:42] Mhm.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; And they don't want anything to do with
[54:46] it, but they are struggling.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; And when you face them, then you realize
[54:51] they they are more struggling than even
[54:53] the people who want it. Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; So avoid
[54:58] recording the building. See it with your
[55:00] own eyes and we move on. Are we clear?
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Lord's willing at the end of the service
[55:05] we will have water baptism and I send
[55:08] you quote in the church group chat about
[55:11] the pictures.
[55:12] of Offman and for some reason I didn't
[55:16] uh I never uh caught it until I put the
[55:20] quote together that brother Brandham say
[55:22] he didn't like Salsman picture.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Okay, I leave it. You go back again and
[55:28] you read the quote. Okay, go back again
[55:31] and read the quote. I thought I
[55:33] highlighted for you but I thought you
[55:35] ced. Okay, I'm not going to say
[55:38] anything. You will go back and read the
[55:40] quote. I put like four or five code,
[55:42] read it slowly and read what brother
[55:44] Brandham said because I usually wonder
[55:47] what that picture was. I saw Catholic
[55:49] using that picture.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; And I didn't know why and until I read
[55:53] and brother Brandham say I don't like uh
[55:56] uh Solsman picture. I like Offman
[55:58] because that's the way I saw him. So
[56:01] before I say what I want to say, you go
[56:03] back and review the quote. Then if you
[56:05] can remind me next Sunday, then I'll
[56:07] tell you what to do. But as for this
[56:09] church, this is the picture we keep.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; And this picture was confirmed by the
[56:16] clouds.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; So, if I want to have a picture of
[56:21] Christ in my house,
[56:23] &gt;&gt; this is the one I keep.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I even gave you a quote. Brother
[56:26] Brandham say when he prayed,
[56:28] &gt;&gt; he he he positioned himself so that the
[56:32] picture of of man is looking at him. Go
[56:34] see the church group.
[56:36] Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I saw you doing heart and this and this
[56:41] and and I thought you read
[56:44] &gt;&gt; and I verify everybody that read. This
[56:47] is your pastor. I click and I then I
[56:48] verify everybody that read.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Even Even if you didn't do this, I
[56:53] verify you
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; So go back and review the code
[57:01] &gt;&gt; and go see. But as of me and this church
[57:04] and my house,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; that's right, brother. This is the
[57:07] picture we keep.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Keep this in mind because when you see
[57:11] him
[57:14] &gt;&gt; this is the way he will look like.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. There is one thing that I forgot
[57:22] last Sunday
[57:24] &gt;&gt; that I'm trying to put it then we can
[57:26] start our reading of the scripture.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; You okay with it?
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Can I read it to you?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was when we were with me and I
[57:35] forgot. I put you mean have seven
[57:37] letters.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; That one you already understand.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; There was something the Holy Spirit
[57:41] pricked to me. I thought I'm going to
[57:43] use it this Sunday, but the direction
[57:45] went differently. If you can go to the
[57:47] book of Daniel quick and then we will
[57:50] go. I just want to make sure this is
[57:52] settled.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:03] Daniel 6
[58:08] verse 8. If you're there, you can say
[58:10] amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; If you move quickly so we can go back to
[58:15] our scripture.
[58:18] You there?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; You slept well.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:25] Uh
[58:29] verse eight, the Bible says, "Now, oh
[58:32] king," you know the story here. If I
[58:35] begin to get in this story, then I won't
[58:37] preach. So let's touch what we want to
[58:40] say. Now, oh king, establish the decree.
[58:45] This is the people that came. They knew
[58:47] Daniel was praying and they searched
[58:49] Daniel in everything. They could not
[58:51] catch him.
[58:52] They say you know what there is only one
[58:54] place we can catch him is that boy is
[58:57] strict with the word.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Ah this is now dropping. I was trying to
[59:03] avoid it. That boy is really strict with
[59:05] brother M with brother brandam say
[59:08] brother brandam say brother brandam say
[59:12] &gt;&gt; sir.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; That sister is really strict with the
[59:18] prophet.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; That's the only way. Let's put a law
[59:23] &gt;&gt; that will go toward that place
[59:26] &gt;&gt; to put them in trouble.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; But usually you open up the third pool.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And oh king established the decree and
[59:36] sign the wring that it be not changed.
[59:41] We clear?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; According to the law of the Mides and
[59:46] what?
[59:46] &gt;&gt; The Persians
[59:47] &gt;&gt; which alterth not. In other word, this
[59:50] law once they make them,
[59:53] &gt;&gt; there is no amendment.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; You don't change them.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; They stay there forever.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 15. Then these men
[1:00:07] assembled to the king and say to the
[1:00:09] king, "No, O king." In other words,
[1:00:12] they're reminding the king, "Hey, you're
[1:00:14] trying to save Daniel. Hey, remember
[1:00:16] this. Know oh king that the law of the
[1:00:20] mid and Persian is that no decree
[1:00:25] no statute which the king establish may
[1:00:29] be what?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Changed.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; So if a law is established it cannot be
[1:00:34] changed.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And if the king add another law
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; or sanction another law even the king
[1:00:42] himself
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; can no longer change it.
[1:00:47] In other words, the new law
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; is now part of the old law.
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; And both laws are one.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; If I lost you, you raise your hand.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Esther one.
[1:01:03] Then I finish. Thank God you're doing
[1:01:06] good today.
[1:01:09] I pray you stay like that.
[1:01:16] Oh, glory to God. Let's go to the book
[1:01:19] of Esther.
[1:01:31] Glory to God. Esther chapter 1
[1:01:37] and drop to verse uh
[1:01:40] 19.
[1:01:49] I was going to ROF instead of Esther.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Give me a minute so we can get this and
[1:01:57] uh move clearly. Esther 1 verse 19. If
[1:02:01] you dare, you can say amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 19. Remember this is Meukan who's
[1:02:07] speaking the seventh one, right?
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; On the seventh day, right?
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The last day of the feast,
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; the seventh chamberlain, I mean prince,
[1:02:17] who was the seventh one,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; the last one, the wise one,
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; the one who knew time.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; The one who introduced the season.
[1:02:25] That's right.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; The one who preached marriage and
[1:02:27] divorce.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; We clear, right?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; This is Meukan who's talking. Verse 19,
[1:02:32] he said, "If he pleased the king,
[1:02:35] remember Esther,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:38] Let there go a royal commandment from
[1:02:41] him.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; It is not the king talking. It is mean
[1:02:45] who's talking.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; The commandment will come from the king,
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; but the one who talking
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; is meukan.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, it looks like Meukan is
[1:03:00] putting the commandment in the mouth of
[1:03:02] the king.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:03:07] Okay.
[1:03:10] So, there is an echo between Meukan and
[1:03:13] the king. Yes, sir.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; The word echo.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; It's me. Be careful. It's the king.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; I will try to preach what I want to
[1:03:27] preach today. Amen. If he please the
[1:03:30] king, let there go a royal commandment
[1:03:33] from him and let it be written
[1:03:38] among the what?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; The laws
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; of what?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; The Persians
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; and the water
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; and the means.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; So whatever is going to come out of Mo
[1:03:46] of Mean,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; come on, brother.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Will be incorporated into the law.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; The law already existed. Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; But there is something that is coming
[1:04:02] from the month of Meukan.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; And whatever is coming from the month of
[1:04:09] Meukan is going to be incorporated to
[1:04:12] the law.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, what Meukan is saying is
[1:04:20] going to have the same value
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; and the same authority
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; as the law that already existed.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; In other word, once what muan say is
[1:04:36] sealed,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; you cannot separate the law
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; from what mean has said. Yes sir.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, the law and what Meukan
[1:04:46] is saying become one.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; And if you cannot change the law,
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; you cannot change what Meukan is saying.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, the same respect that
[1:05:00] was given to the law.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; That respect now is put on the word of
[1:05:05] Meukan.
[1:05:08] In other word, the same respect that was
[1:05:10] put on the Bible.
[1:05:13] Come on, brother. Come on, brother.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Is going to be put on the message of
[1:05:19] Yahweh.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Just like he have, you cannot add
[1:05:24] anything
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; or retrieve anything from the Bible. You
[1:05:29] cannot add anything to the message and
[1:05:32] nor remove anything because the message
[1:05:35] have the same sanction as the Bible.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, the message and the
[1:05:41] Bible are one.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we repeat brother
[1:05:53] Brown on the pulpit.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Amen. Because we are not
[1:05:57] repeating the word of a man.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; We are repeating the word of God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; We are repeating the commandment of the
[1:06:04] king.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Why do we read the message on the
[1:06:10] pulpit?
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody even say that could be a 23rd
[1:06:23] chapter.
[1:06:29] And brother Brandham come he said no no
[1:06:30] no he was already inside there.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; In plain word this message
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; is nothing but the Bible.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; The way you respect the Bible, you
[1:06:49] respect the message.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; The way you respect what the Bible say.
[1:06:54] That's the way we respect what brother
[1:06:56] Brandham says.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; If you say brother Brandham say here and
[1:07:03] here, he says here, I can go in the
[1:07:04] Bible and show you the same thing.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible say here two people. The Bible
[1:07:08] say here one person.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; That's why it's easy for that to slide
[1:07:14] into the laws of mission and Persia.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that message have to be
[1:07:22] interpreted in every language
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; and sent in every tongue.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; The message that was going on all over
[1:07:32] the world to every tongue and language
[1:07:34] was actually the word of
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Meukan.
[1:07:39] That's exactly right.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; So it's the word of Meukan that are
[1:07:42] going to Africa
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; to India to South America collecting the
[1:07:48] virgin. That's right.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Collecting the virgin all over the world
[1:07:55] and bringing them together to the
[1:07:58] palace.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; It's a message that is collecting the
[1:08:01] bride
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; all over the world to bring the bride
[1:08:05] back together.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whoever was struggling with the
[1:08:15] message and the Bible and the message
[1:08:17] and the Bible and the message and the
[1:08:19] Bible, they already reading the Bible,
[1:08:21] then they read again the message. We are
[1:08:23] reading the word of
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Meanana
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; because it's the law of the present
[1:08:28] time.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; It's the law of the season.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; It is the message of Yahweh,
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; the message of the season.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. So be careful how
[1:08:43] you play with the message.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; So when the message say you should never
[1:08:47] marry an unbeliever,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; it is the same as the Bible who says
[1:08:52] that.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham say you only marry
[1:08:56] somebody that look like you
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; only marry a message believer
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; that is filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Anyone against that is enter message.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen?
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Whatever brother Brandham say, we stick
[1:09:14] with it.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Because when you believe the prophet,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; you obey the prophet, then you will
[1:09:19] prosper.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; When brother say something,
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to move.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to even waver. I am not
[1:09:36] going to even negotiate
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; because God vindicated and sanctioned
[1:09:40] the message.
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know why you struggling.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; What you reading in the Bible, it's
[1:09:49] Moses who saved.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; What you read in the Bible, it is Paul
[1:09:55] who saved. What you read in the Bible?
[1:09:59] What you read in the Bible? It is
[1:10:01] Matthew who said
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; it is John who said it is the same
[1:10:06] brother saying
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Elijah a man of light passion. Yes
[1:10:18] brother a man of light passion. But when
[1:10:21] they spoke they spoke under the Holy
[1:10:23] Ghost.
[1:10:25] Yes.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; That's why they say this is thus sayith
[1:10:28] the Lord.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's not me. It is God
[1:10:31] inspiring me to speak.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; So when the prophet says stick behind it
[1:10:36] and anything against the prophet, I will
[1:10:39] not support you.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; You didn't hear me well.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Anything against this message, don't put
[1:10:45] me in.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Don't put me. Don't call me there. I
[1:10:49] will stick with the message of the hour.
[1:10:54] [Applause]
[1:10:57] Are we together?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not a pastor who will compromise
[1:11:00] with you.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; You voted me to stand by the word.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; If what I'm preaching is hard, leave the
[1:11:07] musician.
[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; If the message is too strong, don't get
[1:11:13] into the technician.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Remove from the office.
[1:11:23] Because brother Brandham say we must be
[1:11:25] 100% together.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; 100%.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; I'm 100% with the message.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Most of our war is because one is going
[1:11:45] off the word
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; then we make it personal.
[1:11:49] I don't have any problem with you
[1:11:51] personal but I stand by the word of God
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; and I have to stand by my conviction. If
[1:11:57] I have to stand alone, I stand alone.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Because the message is under the laws of
[1:12:04] nent persia,
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; it cannot be altered.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Parent, are we together?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Parent, are we together?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Spoken word, are we together?
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Invisible audience, are we together?
[1:12:18] Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a big clap.

[1:13:43] the ability you have given me. When it
[1:13:46] comes to interpret the word and to speak
[1:13:49] and to bless your children, you only
[1:13:51] take the supernatural action of the Holy
[1:13:53] Spirit. Oh God, may you move me
[1:13:55] completely out of the way. May you come
[1:13:57] and speak to our soul and bless us
[1:13:59] visible and invisible audience. May you
[1:14:02] take Lord, Father, this entire service
[1:14:04] unto thy hand in Jesus precious name.
[1:14:07] Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; You need your Bible. You really need
[1:14:11] your Bible. If you don't have it, sit

[1:14:18] different surgery. Sister Adasa, you can
[1:14:21] refocus, please.
[1:14:29] Genesis 12. Follow me very carefully.
[1:14:34] Okay. I cannot read the Bible quickly.
[1:14:39] Especially
[1:14:41] on the church. No,
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; this word is different with the opening
[1:14:47] of the seals.

[1:15:17] And there was a famine in the land. This
[1:15:21] is the land God told Abraham to stay.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; God told you to stay somewhere
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; and famine come.
[1:15:41] You are no longer babies.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; You are grown up now.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; You need to know your God.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And the Pentecostal will tell you, you
[1:15:50] see, God is not there.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; God is not there.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Because famine come.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal understanding.
[1:16:00] Sister Charlene the brother and the
[1:16:02] sister over there. God bless you.
[1:16:04] Welcome to spoken word. You are not

[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; go ahead.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; There is famine.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And God told Abraham, "This is the
[1:16:22] land." Correct.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And Abraham of 2025 entered there. Say,
[1:16:29] "Oh, I'm in the God-given position." Oh,
[1:16:32] hallelujah. Pop famine.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Am I in the right place?
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. That's a question.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Can we preach?
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, can we read the Bible?
[1:16:52] Can we read the Bible?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Ah, and there was famine in the land.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; And Abraham went down into what?
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Egypt.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said this was a mistake.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Egypt.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said regardless of what
[1:17:11] happened,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Abraham should never move
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; from the promised land.
[1:17:22] There is famine of marriages.
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Egypt
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; to go find a brother
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; to go find a sister.
[1:17:42] Jesus,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; have your way, Lord.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] It's a shame
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; message believer message
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; they have denomination of people they go
[1:18:00] to
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; are we going over there for prayer
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; and then when they get hallelujah
[1:18:10] and they come back they say over there
[1:18:12] the prayer is so hard
[1:18:15] they say
[1:18:17] they come back You playing games.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I even heard a message brother. He said,
[1:18:26] "Brother, you should hear how
[1:18:27] denominational are praying." I'm telling
[1:18:29] you, they are really good in prayer. Why
[1:18:33] is the prayer not changing their lives?
[1:18:40] [Applause]
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; They're praying, they're fasting, and
[1:18:43] tomorrow the woman that was fasting is
[1:18:46] coming up with short Right. Right.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Breast hanging outside.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost cannot clean their
[1:18:54] life.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; A message believer running after gift
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; or they prophesy over there. You're
[1:19:13] going to get into bummus.
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; We eating from the message. We eating
[1:19:24] from denominational preaching.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Abraham went down where?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; To Egypt. Egypt represent what
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; the world.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; So our brother backsliding
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; because there is the message is too
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I don't see prosperity here
[1:19:57] we the message people we are struggling
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; over there.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; So
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; is my Bible different than yours?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; He went from Canaan to what?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Egypt. Let me put Egypt down
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; came up from the world
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; going back for the world because of
[1:20:21] what?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Because of difficult situation.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; There is
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; because of difficult
[1:20:32] circumstances
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; exactly
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; that have happened in the promised land.
[1:20:38] We want to find a solution outside.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; We heard that there is a prophet in the
[1:20:44] denomination when he touches you. Boom.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And you see message believer.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; There is a denominational prophet. A
[1:21:04] denominational prophet.
[1:21:06] [Applause]
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:10] It's a shame.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; It's a shame.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; You are way down here. You stoop down.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of feminine.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Because of a body desire.
[1:21:31] There is my father.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; There is one
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; because of a craving of the body
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; a lasting spirit.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Glory glory.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Abraham went down to Egypt.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt my friend.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He went down to Egypt to what?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Sojourn there. Do you know what sour
[1:22:01] means?
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Temporarily.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, the brother knows how to
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; I'm a message believer.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; You playing games.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; In other words, because situation are
[1:22:22] not good. Let me I know I know I know
[1:22:24] I'm the promised land. I know the
[1:22:26] promis. didn't say I refuse the promised
[1:22:28] land but
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; for for now for now.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He went to surge there for the
[1:22:36] famine was what?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Grievious
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; where
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; in the land.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; The famine in the promised land was how
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; grievous.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; How can the promised land have a
[1:22:52] grievous famine?
[1:22:58] And God told Abraham, "Stay there."
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; It looks like God put you in trouble.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Right. That's it.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; You need to be wise.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; We get there, my friend. Where are we
[1:23:13] at?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 11.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 11. And it came to pass
[1:23:17] when he was come near to enter what?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Into Egypt.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; That he said to what?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Sarah his wife. So when you start going
[1:23:25] the wrong way,
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; a lying spirit,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; a lying spirit
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; begin to come
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; because one spirit is now drawing
[1:23:39] another spirit.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And this lie is not an open blank lie.
[1:23:53] It is a political lie.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; We have them in the message a lot.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; It's lying intelligently.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; But God will deal with you.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of time. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that and it came to pass
[1:24:12] when he was come near to enter Egypt
[1:24:15] that he said to Sarah his wife, "Behold,
[1:24:19] now I know
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; that you are how?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; A fair woman to look upon."
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Beautiful like sister Cheryl.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he was in the promised land,
[1:24:36] the beauty of sister Sharon was not a
[1:24:38] problem.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. The beauty of Sarah was not a
[1:24:41] problem.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Now that he's going to Egypt, something
[1:24:50] that was normal
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; over there begin to be a problem over
[1:24:57] there.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:25:02] Are we together?
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; All this time you didn't see that Sarah
[1:25:08] was beautiful.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Only now.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Honey, you know you good. You I'm very
[1:25:17] beautiful.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, honey. Thank you. I appreciate it.
[1:25:23] That's not really the point.
[1:25:26] I thought you were giving me compliment.
[1:25:28] No,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; you know where we going.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; We're going among unbelievers.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; When you were leaving, you didn't know
[1:25:37] where you were going.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; When you were leaving, you didn't know
[1:25:41] where you were going. You didn't know
[1:25:42] you were going to Egypt.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Playing games. Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He says that he said to Sarah, his wife,
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; behold now I know that you are a fair
[1:25:52] woman.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; It's good for a man to know that his
[1:25:55] wife look beautiful.
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:26:01] It is good to
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; if you say amen, we will move quickly.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; If not, we got problem.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, it shall come to pass
[1:26:21] when the Egyptians shall see you,
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; that they shall say, "This is his wife,
[1:26:27] and they will kill me, but they will
[1:26:29] save you alive."
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It's already a risk, brother.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Why you keep going?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Number one, who told you to go there?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Say, "I pray you.
[1:26:49] you are my sister
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; which was true
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; but in this case it was not true
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; because him and sister were doing
[1:27:00] certain things that brother and sister
[1:27:01] don't do
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; you fine okay
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; you're fooling somebody
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; fooling somebody
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; if you use sister you sister all time.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; I pray you are my sister that I may be
[1:27:26] well with me for your sake and my show
[1:27:30] and my soul shall live because of who?
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Of thee.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass that when Abraham
[1:27:35] was come to Egypt, the Egyptian beheld a
[1:27:39] woman that she was how
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; very fair.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; So these Egyptian begin to see a beauty
[1:27:45] they have never seen. That's right.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; A message sister have entered in the
[1:27:52] wrong territory.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And she look different.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; They say who is this?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; This is not our women who their belly
[1:28:03] are hanging out.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; This one look holy.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; What are you doing in this territory?
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Who sent you here?
[1:28:14] Hallelujah.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is famine in there over there.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Now, it came to pass uh uh verse 15, the
[1:28:27] princes also of Pharaoh saw her
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; on CNN in Egypt. A woman that came out
[1:28:35] looking beautiful going on. And the
[1:28:38] princes of of of Pharaoh saw her and
[1:28:41] commanded her before who?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And the woman was taken into Pharaoh
[1:28:46] house.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; What about if when they came they say
[1:28:50] it's a wife of somebody. Would they have
[1:28:53] taken him?
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; They say Pharaoh,
[1:29:00] all the women you have in Egypt,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; you never seen this one.
[1:29:07] This one,
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; this is your last opportunity to catch
[1:29:12] this one.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh said, "Woo!
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Did you record her?"
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Word made flesh.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes." When she was passing, we
[1:29:22] held our telephone like this. Word made
[1:29:25] flesh.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh say, "See, let me see.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Go get her. Are we together?" I'm trying
[1:29:33] to leave the airport. Are we together?
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. This is where I'm heading.
[1:29:40] Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; And he entreat Abraham where
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; for who?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Her sake.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; So Abraham begin to get privilege.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; From Pharaoh.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; The brother begin to prosper.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it right there. I'm
[1:30:02] heading somewhere
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; under a lie.
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Hey, it looks like this move of lying
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; is bringing money.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; When I was in Canaan, you see now,
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; you see now it's working
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; foolishly.
[1:30:32] And he intreated Abraham well for her
[1:30:35] sake. And he had what?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Sheep.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. So in Egypt here,
[1:30:39] nothing.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; In Egypt, what is happening?
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Sheep.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And what?

[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And men's servants.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And men's servant.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; And maid servant.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And maid servant. And what?
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; And she assasses.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And camels.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Even new cars.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; You see, we move. We move. Look at us
[1:31:11] now. We have moved.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Look at us now.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Let me put this uh car on WhatsApp. It
[1:31:21] is chemo.
[1:31:31] Have I say something wrong?
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Any camel? That's it.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; A camel. So, brother moved to the wrong
[1:31:40] position.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; There it is, Lord.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; And became rich.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Rich
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; from a lie.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Glory. Bless.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; And message denominational
[1:31:56] believer will say you see how God had
[1:31:59] prospered me. So what I was doing was
[1:32:01] not bad at all.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Remember the rich young ruler.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; You will find yourself in hell.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Any question so far?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Then God came and struck Pharaoh.
[1:32:22] Pharaoh say hey call Abraham.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Listen
[1:32:29] in as a case brother Brandham say Aimc
[1:32:33] taught Isaac sanctification.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I have the code. So now Pharaoh is
[1:32:38] calling brother.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; You you told me this was a
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; sister.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; What a rebuke from unbeliever.
[1:32:50] It's a shame when people outside are
[1:32:53] correcting you.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Look what Pharaoh say. Let's go to verse
[1:33:04] 20.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Verse 20. And Pharaoh commanded his men
[1:33:08] concerning him. And they did what?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; They sent him away.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And who?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; His wife.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; All that he had.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Did Pharaoh remove anything from
[1:33:17] Abraham?
[1:33:18] So Abraham have is living how
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; rich
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; rich
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; at least they didn't kill me. You see
[1:33:29] Sarah they didn't kill me. We
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; are moving to another state. You see
[1:33:36] what we have now
[1:33:39] the Lord. Thank you Jesus for sparing
[1:33:41] us.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So my brother left
[1:33:47] riches
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; and this wealth
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; is coming from a lie.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; And it's a wealth of Egypt.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; It is not the wealth of Canaan.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; It is a wealth that is coming from
[1:34:07] Egypt.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; We are together.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter 13. I told you keep
[1:34:14] your Bible. I'm reading the Bible, my
[1:34:16] friend.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Chapter 13, verse one. If you dare, you
[1:34:19] can say amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; And Abraham went out of what?
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Egypt.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He and who?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; His wife.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; All that he had.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And Lot was with him into the water,
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; the south.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Watch verse two. And Abram was how?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Very rich.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Abraham was how?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Very rich.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Not rich. He was how?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Very rich.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Where did this wealth come from?
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Egypt.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; God have not finished with him yet.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; He was how?
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Very rich.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Very rich in what?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; In cattle.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; In what?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; In cattle.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You see all of this, right?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Very rich in what?
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; In cattle.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Very rich in cattle. And what?
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; In silver.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; In silver.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And what else?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And in gold.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. That's right.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; So brother bank account, credit card,
[1:35:14] American Express, Visa, Master Card, the
[1:35:17] brother have it.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Bank account full from Pharaoh
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; from Pharaoh
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; from a lie.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; We are together.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Job to verse five. Glory to God. I told
[1:35:35] you it's a major surgery. And Lot also
[1:35:38] which went with Abraham had what?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Flocks.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; The brother also got a portion of it.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; He had water
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; and herds
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; and what
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; intents
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; and the land was not able to bear them.
[1:35:56] So they had so much
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; but the place where they were follow me
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; was not a good place
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; to handle the wealth.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; To that the man dwelt together for their
[1:36:15] substance
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; was what?
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Great
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; so that they could not dwell what
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; together.
[1:36:23] So the prosperity begin to cause
[1:36:26] problem.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; God plugged Egypt
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; for Egypt to kick Abraham out.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Abraham was kicked out.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; You following me?
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; God say, "I'm going to teach this boy
[1:36:43] something."
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? When he came out, he's
[1:36:46] still rich.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And they landed into a land, but the
[1:36:51] land is not too fertile
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; enough to support their wealth.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Trouble begin to stop
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; because originally speaking, God called
[1:37:05] Abraham alone. Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Not Abraham with his father.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Not Abraham with his mother.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; This work is you and God.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; You will answer before God. Your mother
[1:37:24] will answer before God. Your father will
[1:37:27] answer with before God. Your brother
[1:37:29] before God. Everybody individually.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; But Abraham pick up a lot. Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; And the substance they got stirred the
[1:37:39] trouble.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Verse uh
[1:37:44] uh drop to verse uh 10.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; And Lot lift up his eyes
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; and beheld all water
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; the plain of Jordan
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; that he was how
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; well watered.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Because Abraham say you go left I go
[1:37:59] right.
[1:38:01] They were well watered like water
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; everywhere
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
[1:38:06] Gomorrah even as the water
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; the garden of the Lord
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; like the land of what?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Egypt
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; as you come to what?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Zoe.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; So when Abraham say let's separate one
[1:38:17] another Lot look at the land. When he
[1:38:20] look at the land it reminded him Egypt.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; I'm reading is my Bible different than
[1:38:26] you? Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; But it was an Egypt that look like the
[1:38:30] Garden of Eden.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Please, let's read it again because this
[1:38:37] is different. Let's go to verse 10. Go
[1:38:39] ahead, my friend.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And Lot lifted up his eyes.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And beheld what?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; All the plain of Jordan.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. That he was how?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Well watered everywhere.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Good opportunity. And what?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
[1:38:51] Gomorrah.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Ah, he didn't see Sodom and Gomorrah.
[1:38:53] Uh-huh.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Lot is still looking at something else.
[1:38:56] Sodom and Gomorrah. Even as the water,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; the garden of the Lord,
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; the garden of Eden, like the land of
[1:39:03] what?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Egypt.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; As you come to water, so there was a
[1:39:06] reference
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; like I've seen this opportunity in
[1:39:10] Egypt.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; So this is the place for me to go.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 11. Then Lord choose him what?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; All the plain of Jordan.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And Lot journey how?
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; East. and they separated themselves to
[1:39:24] uh uh the one from water
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; the other.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; So Lot went east and Abraham stay on the
[1:39:30] other land.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Remember where Abraham stayed the land
[1:39:35] was already a problem
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; to sustain the substance
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; because the Bible say Abraham was very
[1:39:44] rich.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So Lot went where he
[1:39:48] can flourish.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Because the land is well water
[1:39:52] is going to take care of his camel. So
[1:39:55] brother Abraham is slowly coming back to
[1:39:59] his first state.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; To a difficult environment
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; and brother Lot move on
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; to a well environment.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; We clear my friend.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; We good?
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 14.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; If you there we can say amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord said to Abraham after
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; so God begin to clean up Abraham.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; A lot of trouble Lot off.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; God look he say okay Lot is off.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; He's no longer there.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Nobody else over there. Okay. Let me now
[1:40:39] deal with Abraham. And the Lord said to
[1:40:41] Abraham after that Lot was separated
[1:40:44] from him. He said do what?
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Lift up now thine eyes. Who's telling
[1:40:48] Abraham to lift up their eyes? God.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; It's not Abraham himself lifting up
[1:40:53] their eyes.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; It is God telling him lift up your eyes,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; but Lot lift up his eyes himself.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Should we come back again or we
[1:41:05] together?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Lot lift up his eyes himself. But
[1:41:09] Abraham lift up the eyes by God command.
[1:41:13] [Music]
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; It depends on who is seeing. That's
[1:41:18] correct brother.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together? There are time you see
[1:41:22] yourself
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; and there are time it's God who see
[1:41:25] through you.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And the Bible says
[1:41:34] you need to receive the word with joy.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know where you were at
[1:41:38] yesterday. Amen. Uh-huh. And he said,
[1:41:40] "Lift up now your eyes and look from the
[1:41:43] place where you are." How?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Northward.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; And what? and southward
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; and water
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; and eastward
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; and water
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; and westward.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; But the problem say God told Abraham now
[1:41:52] investigate the land.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Abraham was there before.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; And famine was there.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Now God bring Abraham back.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, Abraham,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; now raise your eyes. I'm going to show
[1:42:15] you what is in the place
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; that you thought was a problem.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look to the north.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Look over there."
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Turn
[1:42:32] around. Look to the south."
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Turn around. Look over there.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, the eyes of Abraham
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; are going over the property.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:44] Are we together? Where his eyes stop?
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me leave it alone.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; For all the land which you water
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; to thou seeest
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; which thou water
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; seeest.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; So the eyes of Abraham
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; are marking the property.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; All the land which you will see
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; to you
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; will I do what?
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Give it
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; and to what? thy seed
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Did Abraham have a baby?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; So Abraham was not only in famine, but
[1:43:21] he had no children.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. We're talking
[1:43:27] about a tree and season.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham is in the
[1:43:31] winter.
[1:43:35] [Laughter]
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. Are we together?
[1:43:41] Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; And God say, Abraham,
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; look at everything.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; You see all this property,
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I will give it to you
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to give to your children.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; And if you notice, God is saying, I
[1:43:57] will.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible. God is saying what?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I will.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; But Abraham is already there.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; We clear. Verse uh 16. I will make your
[1:44:13] seed as what?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; The dust of the earth.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Did Abraham have a child?
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Here even Ismael is now born.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; So God is looking at Abraham
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; and say
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; you need a land.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; You need a property.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Lift up your eyes. Look, look, look,
[1:44:33] look, look. It's for you. Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And God say, Abraham,
[1:44:41] do you have a baby? No. He say from you,
[1:44:45] I'm going to give a baby. But the babies
[1:44:48] that will come from you,
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I going to be like what? The dust of the
[1:44:52] earth.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Can you count the dust of the earth?
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Did Abraham had a baby?
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Can Sarah conceive?
[1:45:02] So God is giving Abraham a land.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; He's giving him children.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; But nothing is there.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Children
[1:45:13] like the dust of what?
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; The earth.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And like what?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; The sand of the sea.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; And the sand of the sea. Continue. And
[1:45:20] what?
[1:45:22] Continue, my friend. The sand of the
[1:45:25] sea.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; And the dust of the earth. So that if a
[1:45:29] man can number
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; the dust of the earth,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; then shall your seed also be what?
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Number.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; So in other word, the seed, the children
[1:45:39] of Abraham cannot be numbered.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Yet if you look at Abraham, nothing.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; We are together.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 17. Aras endureth.
[1:45:58] through water.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; A first God say look.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; don't look.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; What do you do?
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Did you build a house yet?
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Did you sign the deed yet?
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Did you negotiate with the bank?
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Abraham walk.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Why do you walk? Because I already say
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:46:26] Are we together?
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Walk how?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Through the land, in the water,
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; the length of it
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; and in the water
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; in the breath of it.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; For I will give it to you. Are we clear?
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; So God say, I show you.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; You saw it.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; I gave it to you.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; The children I gave it to you. Now that
[1:46:48] we already finished, work on it.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; So if you see Abraham, you will see a
[1:46:53] man struggling.
[1:46:56] But who's walking on a property?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; There is.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You say, Abraham, why are you walking?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; There is.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; So you trying to buy a property?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Abraham say I already have one.
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; How do you have it?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Did you sign the paper? No. God say so.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Who told you you will live here?
[1:47:23] Every place that the soul of my foot
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; tread upon it,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; God told me to walk on it.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brown say footprint
[1:47:38] means possession.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; In other word, Abraham, put your foot
[1:47:42] there.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Put your foot there. Put your foot
[1:47:47] there.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; So you see Abraham walking like a crazy
[1:47:50] man.
[1:47:52] Yes, sir.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Everybody together.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 14. Now we getting
[1:48:01] to the meat.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; If you there, we can say amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; You there?
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; You there?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 11. If we can finish this
[1:48:13] quick, we'll be good. Verse 11. The way
[1:48:17] you moving, it's very slow. Verse 11.
[1:48:20] Are you there?
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse 14. And they took
[1:48:28] uh
[1:48:31] let's do this. Okay, I want you to get
[1:48:33] the background. Go to verse eight.

[1:48:39] the king of Gomorrah. Follow me my
[1:48:41] friend because when I will begin to pull

[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; All the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; They took the good of where?

[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; and included they took also who
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Lot was where
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; in Sodom.

[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; The four kings. I'm trying to see who
[1:52:51] overcome which side to make sure I'm on
[1:52:53] the right side. The four kings overcome
[1:52:55] five kings.

[1:53:51] church people

[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 15.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go. And he divided himself against
[1:54:59] them. He and his servant by what?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Night.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; And did what?

[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; My brother, let's be realistic a little
[1:55:07] bit.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; A big army with four kings and 300
[1:55:11] people.

[1:55:17] there, 100 over there, 100 so much. And
[1:55:19] then they handle four kings

[1:55:24] servant?
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Right. That's good. Yes sir.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. He said, "And they
[1:55:29] pursued them to Hoba,
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; which is on the left side of Damascus."
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; We clear now?
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Watch verse 16. And he, Abraham,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; brought back what?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; All the goods.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; So now everything that this king have
[1:55:46] taken,
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; follow me my friend, they taken the good
[1:55:50] of Sodom and Gomorrah. They taken the

[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; God will heal you.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; But if you meet God as an alon,
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; it means that God is coming to you to
[2:01:45] make you possessor
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth.

[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; you lost strength,
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; and you are going down. So, he must come
[2:02:36] as a breasted one.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; For God to come to you as the possessor
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth, Abraham must be
[2:02:45] broke.
[2:02:50] Yes sir.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Now Abraham got goods.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Instead of the king of Sodom because the
[2:03:06] king those goods belong to the king of
[2:03:08] Sodom.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; So the king of Sodom will tell Abraham
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; your your wealth.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; It's mine. It's my health.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; So Abraham, you actually got rich by
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; me.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; He said, Abraham,
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; look at me.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Forget about
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; look at me.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; I am blessing you.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; As
[2:03:37] [Applause]
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together? We need to understand
[2:03:46] what is possessor of heaven and earth
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; because we saying possessor of heaven
[2:03:51] and earth. Possessor of heaven and
[2:03:52] earth. What does he mean?
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Church, are we together? I already left
[2:03:56] the airport now. There was a traffic
[2:03:57] there. Amen. Brother Brham says this. He
[2:04:00] says now in Genesis we read of who?
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; meeting who?
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; This great man called Melkisedc.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Who was what?
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; The possessor of both heaven and earth.
[2:04:12] Then he was possessor of what?
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; All things.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Possessor of heaven and earth. That is
[2:04:18] what?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Of all things.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; So Elleon
[2:04:22] means the God that possess what?
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; All things.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Elleon means the God that possess what?
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; All things.
[2:04:40] So if he met Abraham, Abraham was broke.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steven, where did you
[2:04:47] get it?" I told you he was laying in a
[2:04:50] land
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; that was struggling.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Listen to Brother Brham. As we moving,
[2:04:54] Brother Brham says this. I like this.
[2:04:58] Abraham was what?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Heir to all
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; by what?
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; The promise.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Because God told him walk left, right,
[2:05:04] and everything. So he could do what?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Lay claim
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; on what?
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; To everything that was in the land.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; And the land what?
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Itself.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Abraham has been given what
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; the promise.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Now we understand that Abraham was the
[2:05:17] poorest man
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; in what?
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; All the country.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Because he live out in the what?
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; The desert.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; And he live how?
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; In peace with God. Amen.
[2:05:29] [Applause]
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; So God when he remove Lot
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; he begin to make Abraham struggle
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; follow me my friend
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; so that all the wealth of Egypt
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; can be completely removed
[2:05:48] [Applause]
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; in other words Abraham
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want the fingerprint of Egypt in
[2:05:58] your house.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; I don't want an Egyptian to come and to
[2:06:04] say we bless you when you are in Egypt.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; When people come to see you, they need
[2:06:09] to see me.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; They need to see.
[2:06:13] [Applause]
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together,
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; my friend? Let's move together.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; If not, this will turn into a series.
[2:06:24] Are we together?
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God during the process of time
[2:06:30] made the land of Abraham a desertike.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Suddenly the business of Abraham down.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Suddenly everything Abraham got in Egypt
[2:06:43] begin to go down.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Abraham become poor.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; God remove lot. Abraham say, "Praise the
[2:06:56] Lord. Now I'm in peace." God begin to
[2:06:58] remove the cattle.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; He begin to remove this
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; because the servant he had were not the
[2:07:05] one from Egypt. They were born in his
[2:07:07] house.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; God begin to clean up the house of
[2:07:10] Abraham.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Until Abraham become poor.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; When Abraham became poor, God say, "Now
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; let me come down.
[2:07:24] Oh Jesus,
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; when the church of Abraham become very
[2:07:29] leader 318

[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; spoken word
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; learn not to look at the number.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Look at Leon
[2:07:55] [Music]
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; the possessor of all things.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. I told you when
[2:08:04] I begin to jump brother Brandham then
[2:08:06] the fire. Brother Brham say and he live

[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; And peras the what?
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Poorest man in the land.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And yet a claim to possess what?

[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; a man. That is what I like.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; I hope we are clear together. Yes sir.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; God took all the wealth of Egypt
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; and clean it up
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; from the house of Abraham
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; took lot move it away.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; He said only what I give you
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; walk in the land.

[2:09:13] That's where your children are going to
[2:09:15] be. I'm still moving on, my friend.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Then when Abraham got into a fight,
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; he went and he got a lot of money.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; A lot of good,
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; a lot of this things he worked for,
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; So Abraham is back to rich. God said
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; that wealth is coming from what?
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Sodom.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Gomorrah.

[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse uh
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; uh 20.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; And did what?
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; And blessed be the most high God
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; which has what?
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Delivered thine enemies into thy hand.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Stop. How many people went to the
[2:10:58] battle?
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; 318
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; against how many king?
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Four kings.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; How can 318
[2:11:05] beat four king that beat five kings?
[2:11:08] Now, Ellen is saying, Abraham, you know
[2:11:12] the battle that you fought,
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Can we read together?
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; I am the one.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Let's read it. Let's read it. Let's read
[2:11:22] it. Verse uh 20. And blessed be the
[2:11:25] what?
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; The most high God,
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; which delivered what?
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Thine enemies
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; into what?
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Into thy hand.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Who? So, who delivered the enemy of
[2:11:34] Abraham?
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; God. So who fought against the four
[2:11:37] kings?
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; And God was fighting where?
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; In 3 what?
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; 18.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; So when 318 people are going, it was not
[2:11:48] them.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; It was enemy on
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; that was there.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham, the victory you
[2:11:56] just got,
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; I am the one who gave it to you.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:12:03] So the 300 people cannot come and say
[2:12:06] you see how we fought.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; 300 we suck them all.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; No. Normally 300 cannot defeat that type
[2:12:14] of an army. So the 300 must come and say
[2:12:17] brother
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; I never knew I can fight like this.
[2:12:23] I'm telling you when I was fighting I
[2:12:25] just felt like my hand I'm moving this
[2:12:27] way
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; and I'm making move I don't understand
[2:12:30] and it's killing people
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; because your hand must be God hands
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; your eyes must be God's eyes your feet
[2:12:40] must be God's feet so whatever you do it
[2:12:43] is God in human flesh
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; are we together.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say because they were
[2:12:53] farmer.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together? They were not a train
[2:12:57] army.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; But suddenly as they were going to war,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; and Leon anointed them
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; and before you know it, a man that was
[2:13:09] maybe feeble
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; begin to take a big giant and flip him.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't understand. Something
[2:13:15] is happening to us. We flipping this
[2:13:17] giant like a game
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; because it's early and
[2:13:21] [Applause]
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; So Mechisedc came and say fellowship.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; He said Abraham
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bless you
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; and I'm blessing you.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; If you notice he's blessing Abraham but
[2:13:40] Abraham has nothing.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:44] He said, "But I bless you as a possessor
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; of heaven and earth."
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Because the possessor of heaven and
[2:13:51] earth,
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; he himself started with nothing.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; You have not called it yet.
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Father, help this church.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; The possessor of heaven and earth
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; existed by himself.
[2:14:11] [Music]
[2:14:13] He was alone
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; but he himself begin to create planet.

[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; The possessor of heaven earth,
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; he was alone.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; And then he begin to create things.
[2:14:35] Amen.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; He said, Abraham, now that you are the
[2:14:40] poorest man,
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; this is the time for me to teach you
[2:14:45] something.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Number one, I'm blessing you.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; I'm taking the anointing
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; of Elenon and I'm putting that anointing
[2:14:55] on you.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Because what you have
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; the first time was coming from Egypt.
[2:15:05] You have it from a lie.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; The next time you got it from Sodom,
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to have sodomite stuff
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; into your home.

[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Victuals.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; And Lot's goods.

[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Women.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; And what?

[2:18:55] to Abraham
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; before the king of Sodom.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; So Abraham now knows
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; that the Elleion bless him.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; But Abraham was struggling.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. Buckle up.

[2:22:46] possessor of everything? The possessor
[2:22:48] of heaven and earth. Elleon, who is it?

[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; so Abraham was a big container.
[2:41:15] Elohim, the word was a big container.
[2:41:21] [Music]
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Let's make it worse to Paul. Paul say,
[2:41:34] "And as I may say, so who?"
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; Levi also.
[2:41:40] Paul say these were where
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Paul say what
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; liver who also receive what
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; tithe
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; he did what
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; paid tithe in Abraham
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; in Genesis 14 did you see
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; no
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; where was
[2:42:02] [Music]
[2:42:03] [Applause]
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; having nothing
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; yet possessing
[2:42:13] [Music]
[2:42:15] Some of you are lost.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "And also as a message." So who
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; Levi also
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; who did what
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; receiveth the tithes?
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; Paid that where?
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; In Abraham.
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; So Levi was where?
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; In Abraham.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; For he was what?
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; Yet in the loins of his father. His
[2:42:38] father who? Leva was his father is
[2:42:40] Jacob.
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; But his father is who?
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; If sons of Leah were in Abraham
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; and Leva was in Abraham. Where was
[2:42:49] Jacob?
[2:42:49] &gt;&gt; In Abraham.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Where was Isaac?
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; In Abraham.
[2:42:53] [Applause]
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; So when the season come,
[2:43:08] When the season come,
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Isaac, Abraham bring Isaac.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; And he's bringing Isaac as a package.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; And Isaac bring Jacob.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; But both of them was in Abraham.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; And Jacob bring liver.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Are we together?
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; Leon started himself,
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; but in him were stuff.
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; And when he became the word, he begin to
[2:43:45] bring out what was in him.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; Lever in Abraham,
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; Jacob,
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; Isaac,
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; Abraham,
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; the sons of Lev,
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; in Abraham,
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; all of them until Paul say Abraham, the
[2:43:59] father of what?
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; As all
[2:44:04] That's what Paul say in the New
[2:44:05] Testament.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham have all of them.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; So all it take is anoint Abraham.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; And Abra and what was in Abraham
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; begin to come out.
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; But at the beginning there was nothing.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; Now this is the point. When Abraham
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; brought Isaac at the beginning, did
[2:44:35] anybody see Isaac?
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Did anybody see Jacob?
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; Did anybody see Leah?
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; But the Bible say Leah was there.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; Did anybody see the sons of Leah?
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; All of this came through the process of
[2:44:49] time.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; But they were already there.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; They came in their season.
[2:44:56] [Music]
[2:44:59] So there is a time Abraham is look like
[2:45:01] no children
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; but as the time goes on you will be
[2:45:05] surprised
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; how many children
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; are coming from Abraham
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; because God already bless him
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; is Tony third here
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; you know Tony the third
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; the the Beautiful, handsome boy.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; You see how that boy is?
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; You see how that boy is? The baby boy is
[2:45:30] there.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; People are in him.
[2:45:33] [Applause]
[2:45:34] [Music]
[2:45:36] [Applause]
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't understand. As small as
[2:45:43] he is,
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; everything is in him.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; Just let him grow
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; and you will find who was in him.
[2:45:57] He's a possessor of many things.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; In other word, what belong to your life
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; is already in you.
[2:46:07] [Music]
[2:46:11] [Applause]
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, I'm giving you time to
[2:46:18] swallow that one.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Paul say in Hebrew 11,
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; he said through what?
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; We understand that what
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; the worlds
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; that early Leon did
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; were framed by what?
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; How many words?
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; The worlds
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; one
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; plural.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; How many of them?
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; Many.
[2:46:46] Paul is saying the universe that you see
[2:46:49] there
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; were made were fabricated
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; were framed by the word of God
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; by Elle Leon being the word of God
[2:47:02] because he was first possessor
[2:47:04] &gt;&gt; of what
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; and then the Bible call him possessor of
[2:47:09] what?
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; So heaven was where?
[2:47:13] and earth was where
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; so what did
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; express what was where
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; in
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; and Paul is saying that he did that by
[2:47:26] faith
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; by revelation
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; when he knew what was in him
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; he begin to speak it Jesus.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; So that the things which are what?
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; See,
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; the never that you see
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; when was not made of things that do
[2:48:00] what?
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; Appear.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, before was manifested,
[2:48:06] he was first invisible.
[2:48:11] Let me go back again.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible is saying, Paul is saying, for
[2:48:18] the things which are what?
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; Seen,
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; these things were made of things. What?
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; Were not made of things.
[2:48:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, this visible things
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; came from the invisible things.
[2:48:35] So before he became visible,
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; he was first what?
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; Invisible.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Before Leah came out,
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; Leah was already invisibly
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; in the loss of Abraham.
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; When Abraham was poor,
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; his children was there.
[2:48:53] &gt;&gt; His wife was there.
[2:49:01] [Applause]
[2:49:05] Are we together?
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's go to Genesis 15.
[2:49:11] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; I already went over. I got to stop.
[2:49:16] &gt;&gt; I got to stop. It's impossible. The
[2:49:19] Lord, this is just God. We got to call
[2:49:21] this something else.
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's get uh
[2:49:30] &gt;&gt; let me get 15 and see.
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 15.
[2:49:35] After these things, I showed you that
[2:49:38] when the king of Sodom
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; was belittling Abraham.
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; Abraham already was possessing Levah.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; To possess Levah means you possess the
[2:49:49] sons of Levah. You possess Jacob, you
[2:49:51] possess Isaac. In other word, Abraham
[2:49:54] cannot die.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; Abraham cannot die.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; Abraham won't die if Isaac is not born.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; Because you are cutting off the line of
[2:50:09] God.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; God already spoke to Leah.
[2:50:13] &gt;&gt; So you cannot kill Isaac
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; until Jacob come out. You cannot kill
[2:50:18] Jacob until Leah come out. So leave push
[2:50:21] the brake on everybody
[2:50:25] [Applause]
[2:50:27] &gt;&gt; and you won't die.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; You won't die
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; until what is in you come out.
[2:50:37] [Applause]
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. You will not die
[2:50:43] if what is in you
[2:50:45] &gt;&gt; doesn't come out.
[2:50:48] That's why when they told Abraham,
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; kill Isaac.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; He say no problem.
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; Bring Isaac
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; with anointing. Bring him
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; Abraham. Are you that scared? Scared of
[2:51:00] what?
[2:51:01] &gt;&gt; If he kill Isaac, leave won't come out.
[2:51:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to slay Isaac.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; He will be forced to quicken Isaac.
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; He will be forced to bring the
[2:51:10] resurrection. When God heard that, he
[2:51:14] went, "Ram, ram, ram, ram, come here.
[2:51:17] Leave Isaac. Leave Isaac. I know you
[2:51:19] good. Isaac, come on. Come on. Kill the
[2:51:21] ram."
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; You're trying to make me make a mistake
[2:51:24] on my plan.
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; What gave Abraham the courage?
[2:51:33] &gt;&gt; He knew. And the Bible say he knew. You
[2:51:35] know
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; that if you kill
[2:51:36] &gt;&gt; Isaac,
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; you must bring everybody up
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; because you already spoke that through
[2:51:42] people will come
[2:51:47] [Music]
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; in other word whatever is in you
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; is even blocking the devil. Amen.
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that one.
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that one.
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; Whatever is in you,
[2:52:09] &gt;&gt; if he need to come out before you leave,
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; even Satan doesn't touch you.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Until whatever seed is there,
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; comes out.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Let's get this. Let's finish it right
[2:52:27] here. Okay, because time is gone.
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; Verse chapter 15, if you dare, you can
[2:52:32] say amen.
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; After these things, verse one,
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord came to who?
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; in the water.
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; In a vision,
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; saying what?
[2:52:41] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; I was going to you all the way to 17.
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; I was going to you slowly all the way to
[2:52:53] And I'm going to take you all the way to
[2:52:55] 24. And you see what happened to Abraham
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; down the road.
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; Because right here he's still poor
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; but you're going to see what happened to
[2:53:05] Abraham.
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; Fear not Abraham I am what?
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; Thy shield
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; and thy exceeding great reward.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; And Abraham say Lord God what will you
[2:53:17] give me? Seeing I go how
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; childless.
[2:53:23] Paul is saying when Abraham previously
[2:53:27] spoke to Mkisedc, what was in Abraham?
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; Leva. The sons of Leva. Look how Abraham
[2:53:34] is talking.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; Abraham doesn't see Levah.
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; He doesn't see the son of Leva. He begin
[2:53:41] to go back to the same crisis again.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; Look how I'm childless.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; And now he begin to bring suggestion. He
[2:53:51] said, "Look how I'm cho and the steward
[2:53:54] of what?
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; My house
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; is what?
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; This Eleaser of Damascus."
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; Do you know what he was really telling
[2:54:00] God?
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; Do you know what he was telling God?
[2:54:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? I don't have a
[2:54:05] child,
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; but I know if I die,
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; Eleazar of Damascus
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; will be."
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't know the children in his
[2:54:17] launch. Lever are dancing. Levi dancing
[2:54:20] in the lungs of Abraham
[2:54:22] [Music]
[2:54:25] &gt;&gt; when he was walking. Levi is there.
[2:54:28] &gt;&gt; Jacob is there. Isaac is there. But the
[2:54:31] time was not yet.
[2:54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:35] [Applause]
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; The season for them to come out
[2:54:39] &gt;&gt; was not yet.
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; God was still preparing stuff.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; In Abraham before he bring them out.
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Amen.
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; And when it looks impossible,
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; God say the next year.
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; But Sarah Sarah is already That's not my
[2:55:03] problem. I say next year
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; according to the time of life.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; Time of life for a 90 years old woman.
[2:55:11] &gt;&gt; Do you think I was crazy when I say time
[2:55:13] of life? I saw her 90 years, but I'm
[2:55:15] saying the time of life. Amen. Amen.
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; Father help me flat attendant prepare
[2:55:23] for landing. He says in uh verse uh
[2:55:26] three and Abraham say behold to me you
[2:55:30] have given what?
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; No seed.
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; What was inside of Abraham?
[2:55:34] &gt;&gt; Look what was inside of Abraham. And
[2:55:36] what is Abraham saying?
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; Because and I have a quote where brother
[2:55:42] Brandham say we belings I'm paraphrasing
[2:55:46] stuff because of what we see outside.
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; He says and Abraham say Lord uh verse uh
[2:55:53] Abraham behold to me you have given
[2:55:55] what?
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; And lo one born in my house is what?
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; My heir.
[2:56:00] &gt;&gt; In other words Ezra who was born here is
[2:56:02] the one that's going to take over
[2:56:04] everything. And behold, the word of the
[2:56:06] Lord came to him saying,
[2:56:08] &gt;&gt; "This shall not be your head."
[2:56:11] &gt;&gt; So you begin to adopt children.
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; You forget who is Elon.

[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; But he that shall come forth out of
[2:56:25] what?
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham, let me be
[2:56:28] precise
[2:56:29] &gt;&gt; because you don't understand something.
[2:56:31] When I told you from you,
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; I mean from your
[2:56:35] &gt;&gt; Bower
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; because now you're trying to find
[2:56:40] alternative

[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; He says, "But he shall come forth for
[2:56:57] out of your bower shall be what?"
[2:56:59] &gt;&gt; Thine air. And he brought him forth
[2:57:02] where
[2:57:02] &gt;&gt; abroad.
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; And say what?
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; Look now toward heaven.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; And tell what?
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; The stars.
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; If you be able to do what?
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; To number them.
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; And he said to him, "So shall your seed
[2:57:15] what?"
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; Be.
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; We clear there.
[2:57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:57:33] Oh my.
[2:57:35] Praise God. I'm trying to get you where
[2:57:36] he even changed the name of Sarah.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:57:44] &gt;&gt; I got it. Let's go to 17 and then we
[2:57:46] finish. Genesis 17 and then we finish
[2:57:50] right here. If you dare, you can say
[2:57:51] amen.
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:53] And when Abraham was 90 years old and
[2:57:56] nine
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; plus
[2:58:02] I'm just cleaning sorry the Lord appear
[2:58:05] to Abraham and say to him I am almighty
[2:58:09] God. In other words, God is revealing
[2:58:12] all his stuff.
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; Walk before me and be you how?
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; And I will make my covenant between you,
[2:58:21] between me and you. And I will do what?
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; Multiply things.
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; How?
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; Exceedingly.
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; He's talking to a poor man.
[2:58:29] &gt;&gt; That I'm going to multiply you
[2:58:30] exceedingly.
[2:58:32] And Abraham fell on his face. And God
[2:58:35] talked with him, saying, "Be as for me,
[2:58:39] behold, my covenant is where?
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; With thee.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; And you shall be a father of what?
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; Many nations.
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; Abraham, you shall be a father of what?"
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; Many nations.
[2:58:57] Israel is a nation
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; one
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; but God say Abraham
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; will be a father of what?
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; Many nations.
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say even Germany,
[2:59:08] America and all of them.
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; I have the quote.
[2:59:13] &gt;&gt; Now Abraham
[2:59:15] you will be a father of what?
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; Many nations.
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; He said you will be a father of many
[2:59:23] nation. Have I what?
[2:59:26] Go to verse uh uh five. And neither
[2:59:30] shall your name anymore be called what?
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; We will finish here. But your name shall
[2:59:39] be called what?
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[2:59:43] &gt;&gt; For a father of what?
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; Many nations have I made thee.
[2:59:47] &gt;&gt; So God switched something in Abraham.
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; And we stop here.
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Abraham name was Abraham.
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; And God put what?
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[3:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; He put Abra what?
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham. Right.
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; So there is an H and a A that have been
[3:00:16] put there.
[3:00:26] A B C D E F G
[3:00:30] &gt;&gt; H
[3:00:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; I J.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; Which letter was put?
[3:00:47] &gt;&gt; And which letter was put?
[3:00:50] Because one and eight are the same.
[3:00:53] &gt;&gt; They are the loop of eternity.
[3:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:01] &gt;&gt; The Jewish calendar
[3:01:03] &gt;&gt; is Sunday.
[3:01:06] &gt;&gt; Monday,
[3:01:07] &gt;&gt; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; Saturday, and Sunday.
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; Sunday is the first the eighth day, and
[3:01:16] it's the first day of the week.
[3:01:21] And God took those two letter and hook
[3:01:24] it to Abraham and say from now on
[3:01:27] &gt;&gt; you are not going to be called again
[3:01:29] Abraham. Now you're going to be called
[3:01:31] what? Abraham which is what father or
[3:01:34] what?
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 16.
[3:01:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And God said to Abraham, "As
[3:01:45] for Sarah, your wife, you shall call her
[3:01:48] what?
[3:01:49] &gt;&gt; You shall not call her name Sarah, but
[3:01:51] &gt;&gt; but shall call her what?"
[3:01:52] &gt;&gt; Sarah shall her name be.
[3:01:54] &gt;&gt; And I will bless her and give you a son
[3:01:57] also of her. Yeah. I will bless her, and
[3:02:00] she shall be the water,
[3:02:02] &gt;&gt; the mother of nations.
[3:02:03] &gt;&gt; Now, we have a father of what?
[3:02:05] &gt;&gt; Nations.
[3:02:06] &gt;&gt; And a mother of what?
[3:02:07] &gt;&gt; Of nations.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; Let's finish here. What does he mean by
[3:02:14] adding these two letters?
[3:02:16] &gt;&gt; Because in Genesis 18, the baby's
[3:02:19] coming.
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; And in Genesis 24, the wealth of Abraham
[3:02:25] is coming.
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 24 and we start.
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; Genesis 24. Let's go to 24. Genesis
[3:02:37] 24:34. Let's go, my friend.
[3:02:40] This is Elaza talking. Let's go.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; Because at the beginning the blessing
[3:02:46] came from Egypt.
[3:02:48] &gt;&gt; Then the second blessing came from Sodom
[3:02:50] and Gomorrah.
[3:02:51] &gt;&gt; Abraham refused. He said, "No, no, no. I
[3:02:53] have Elon."
[3:02:55] &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 34.
[3:02:57] &gt;&gt; You there?
[3:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:58] &gt;&gt; And he said Elaz, I am who?
[3:03:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham's servant.
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; And the Lord has blessed.
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; Who blessed Egypt?
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; Who blessed Sodom?
[3:03:08] &gt;&gt; No. Who blessed Gomorrah?
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; He said the Lord has blessed who?
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; My master gave.
[3:03:16] &gt;&gt; So now the blessing are coming from Goo
[3:03:18] &gt;&gt; God.
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; It just took time.
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; But they were coming.
[3:03:25] &gt;&gt; Isaac was taking time but he was coming.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; He said the Lord has blessed my master.
[3:03:31] How
[3:03:31] &gt;&gt; greatly
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; and he is become how?
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; Great.
[3:03:35] &gt;&gt; And he has given him what? flocks
[3:03:37] &gt;&gt; and water
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; and herds
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; and water
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; and silver.
[3:03:40] &gt;&gt; Remember he had that from Egypt. God
[3:03:42] sucked that all.
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; We don't want the silver from Egypt, the
[3:03:45] silver from Elon.
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; He gave him silver and water
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; and gold
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; and water
[3:03:49] &gt;&gt; and men's servants
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; and water
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; and made and water
[3:03:52] &gt;&gt; and camels
[3:03:52] &gt;&gt; and water and asses.
[3:03:53] &gt;&gt; Stop. Watch what God did. This is the
[3:03:57] list from Egypt.
[3:04:03] &gt;&gt; This is the list from what?
[3:04:05] &gt;&gt; Egypt. God say remove that
[3:04:09] &gt;&gt; the list from uh from Sodom and Gomorrah
[3:04:12] God say what
[3:04:13] &gt;&gt; remove it
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; God said let me give you my list
[3:04:17] &gt;&gt; but let's compare the list
[3:04:20] &gt;&gt; let's go on again my friend on verse 34
[3:04:23] and the Lord's God has blessed his
[3:04:26] master with what
[3:04:27] &gt;&gt; flocks
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; with what
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; flocks
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; flocks let me put flocks so you know
[3:04:32] what it means

[3:04:35] &gt;&gt; herd

[3:04:39] flock and what else?
[3:04:40] &gt;&gt; And silver.

[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; from Egypt.
[3:04:48] &gt;&gt; Silver. Uhhuh. And what?
[3:04:50] &gt;&gt; And gold.

[3:05:05] and what
[3:05:05] &gt;&gt; and camels
[3:05:08] &gt;&gt; and asses.
[3:05:12] &gt;&gt; So what did God do?
[3:05:18] &gt;&gt; What did God
[3:05:19] [Applause]
[3:05:24] s?
[3:05:25] &gt;&gt; What did God do?
[3:05:29] When God is removing what is from the
[3:05:32] word, he have what is best.
[3:05:38] Yes sir.
[3:05:40] &gt;&gt; That worldly husband remove him. God
[3:05:43] will give you the best.
[3:05:47] Yes sir.
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; You don't need to go in the world. You
[3:05:51] don't need to go somewhere else. Stay on
[3:05:54] your promised land. Stay in your
[3:05:57] position.
[3:05:58] Meet Alan Leon in his time. He will come
[3:06:03] penless
[3:06:06] oxen, camel and everything. Even Isaac
[3:06:10] cameless
[3:06:13] &gt;&gt; because nothing is impossible to
[3:06:17] I'm taking my time because I need to
[3:06:20] clean you up.
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; I need to clean you up. I need to remove
[3:06:24] everybody that can put a claim in your
[3:06:26] life and say we made him, we made her. I
[3:06:31] don't want anybody to take credit. I am
[3:06:35] hallelujah,
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; possessor of heaven and earth. And you
[3:06:39] are possessor of office.
[3:06:42] &gt;&gt; Everything you have need of is in you.
[3:06:47] [Music]
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:06:50] &gt;&gt; Let's push the break here.
[3:06:52] Sister Adasa
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; call this
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; Elleon.
[3:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:00] &gt;&gt; If not call this the mystery
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; of Elleon.
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; We are preaching revealed mysteries.
[3:07:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[3:07:12] &gt;&gt; church? Let's stop here. Time is gone.
[3:07:15] Let's stand.
[3:07:17] [Applause]
[3:07:31] Hallelujah.
[3:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07:37] &gt;&gt; God
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; doesn't speak
[3:07:40] &gt;&gt; for nothing.
[3:07:43] [Music]
[3:07:44] &gt;&gt; Today you look bare.
[3:07:47] Today you look poor.
[3:07:49] &gt;&gt; Today you look small
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't mean you are what you
[3:07:53] are.
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; What matter is what is inside of you.
[3:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; Sorrowful but yet always rejoicing
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; as having nothing
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; but possessing all things.
[3:08:09] &gt;&gt; All it take.
[3:08:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know that God spoke the word?
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:08:14] And brother Brandham say it took how
[3:08:16] many years?
[3:08:21] &gt;&gt; Because me and you when he say
[3:08:24] &gt;&gt; he came out. Brother Brandham say when
[3:08:26] he spoke he didn't come out.
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; He took
[3:08:31] &gt;&gt; brotherham say million.
[3:08:34] &gt;&gt; But God believed
[3:08:36] &gt;&gt; his own word.
[3:08:38] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham created the square
[3:08:41] the first one came quick.
[3:08:43] &gt;&gt; Yes it did. The second one came quick.
[3:08:45] Brother Brandham said God saym the boy
[3:08:48] he won't learn.
[3:08:51] &gt;&gt; He will be anxious.
[3:08:54] &gt;&gt; The third squirrel God delayed.
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham stop. He say I'm
[3:08:59] going home. He say
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; where you going?
[3:09:02] &gt;&gt; How many did you say?
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; Stay right there.
[3:09:06] &gt;&gt; To teach him
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; the process of time.
[3:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:13] Amen.
[3:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:16] &gt;&gt; What was brother Brandham looking for?
[3:09:19] &gt;&gt; Squirrel. Where was his squirrel at?
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; In LA Leon.
[3:09:25] &gt;&gt; What are you looking for?
[3:09:28] &gt;&gt; What are you looking for in your life?
[3:09:32] &gt;&gt; What do you want
[3:09:33] &gt;&gt; that makes you compromise the word of
[3:09:36] God
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; until you have to leave the message?
[3:09:41] You have to compromise in the word.
[3:09:44] &gt;&gt; You have to tell lies.
[3:09:46] &gt;&gt; You have to maneuver this way and that
[3:09:48] way. What do you need?
[3:09:52] &gt;&gt; God don't want anybody
[3:09:54] &gt;&gt; to take glory
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; of you.
[3:09:57] &gt;&gt; His glory, he would not share it
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; with no one.
[3:10:03] &gt;&gt; Lest you say that I made Abraham rich.
[3:10:07] [Music]
[3:10:09] Leah in you,
[3:10:13] &gt;&gt; Jacob in you,
[3:10:16] &gt;&gt; Isaac in you.
[3:10:17] &gt;&gt; All the patriarch
[3:10:19] &gt;&gt; were in Abraham.
[3:10:21] &gt;&gt; Every patriarch
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; was in Abraham.
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; All of them were in Abraham.
[3:10:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, the entire nation of
[3:10:28] Israel
[3:10:29] &gt;&gt; was in Abraham.
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:33] &gt;&gt; Because I'm not getting where I wanted
[3:10:35] to go. When Abraham finally understood
[3:10:39] the Bible say he begin to call things
[3:10:44] &gt;&gt; that are not as though
[3:10:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham now begin to learn the laws that
[3:10:51] things that are visible
[3:10:53] &gt;&gt; right
[3:10:53] &gt;&gt; are coming from invisible
[3:10:59] &gt;&gt; change your name
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; so when they call you Abraham it will
[3:11:05] hit your here
[3:11:06] &gt;&gt; father of many. We are understanding
[3:11:08] Abraham.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; What we really mean it's father of many
[3:11:12] nation.
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; Father of many nation and he keep
[3:11:15] hitting Abraham. Father of many nation
[3:11:17] until the people say you know what he
[3:11:19] say call him like that. He get upset if
[3:11:21] you say Abraham call him Abraham. And
[3:11:23] the people begin to make fun father of
[3:11:25] many nation.
[3:11:26] &gt;&gt; And God say let it go like that
[3:11:30] until he became father of many nation.
[3:11:34] And by the time Solomon come, you can
[3:11:36] search the scripture. The Bible say the
[3:11:38] number of Israel was so big until no one
[3:11:41] could number Israel.
[3:11:43] &gt;&gt; By the time Solomon came, Israel was
[3:11:45] without number. I can show you that by
[3:11:47] the scripture.
[3:11:49] &gt;&gt; So when Abraham was gone, Abraham
[3:11:52] blessing still gone.
[3:11:56] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[3:11:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly this
[3:12:00] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[3:12:03] grace, for your love, for your mercy,
[3:12:06] and for everything you have been doing
[3:12:07] for us. Father, this is as far as you
[3:12:10] wanted me to go with the ability you
[3:12:13] have given. Father, you have spoken to
[3:12:15] somebody.
[3:12:17] Of course, you spoken to all of us to
[3:12:20] depend completely upon thee. The world
[3:12:24] is not our inheritance. The system of
[3:12:26] this world is not what we depending on.
[3:12:29] compromising on the message because of
[3:12:32] difficulty of time and circumstances.
[3:12:35] It's not what you're calling us for.
[3:12:38] You're calling us to stay on your
[3:12:40] position. And you are revealing to each
[3:12:42] one of us today that whatever we need of
[3:12:46] &gt;&gt; is in us
[3:12:48] &gt;&gt; and all it takes is a process of time.
[3:12:51] And when the time comes right and the
[3:12:53] season arrive, there is nothing that
[3:12:56] will block whatever was put in us to
[3:12:58] come out. Father, when I was born, my
[3:13:02] mother did not know that she was holding
[3:13:05] a doctor. She did not know that she was
[3:13:08] holding a pastor. She did not know that
[3:13:12] she was holding a deacon. She is not
[3:13:14] know that she was holding a business
[3:13:16] owner. All the potential that was in me,
[3:13:20] none of them were manifested in that
[3:13:22] time.
[3:13:22] &gt;&gt; But Lord, Father, I was born like a
[3:13:24] package. And through the process of
[3:13:26] time, the devil was unable to stop all
[3:13:30] of them.
[3:13:31] &gt;&gt; And whatever is still inside that need
[3:13:34] to come out will continue to come out.
[3:13:36] &gt;&gt; And Satan will have no power to stop any
[3:13:39] of them.
[3:13:40] &gt;&gt; Even when you were coming up in this
[3:13:42] world, the devil thought he can stop
[3:13:44] you. He went killing children. But he
[3:13:47] never touched the promised seed. Because
[3:13:49] what you have determined by your prayer,
[3:13:52] by your forn knowledge, Father, no
[3:13:54] matter what it is, it will come to pass.
[3:13:56] Lord, may your children rest on your
[3:13:58] word.
[3:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; May they rest upon Ellelon, the
[3:14:02] possessor of all things,
