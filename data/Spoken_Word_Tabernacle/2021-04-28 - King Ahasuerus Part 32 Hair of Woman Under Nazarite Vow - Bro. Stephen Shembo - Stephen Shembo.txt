========================================

i think was yesterday today so she's doing way much you know a whole lot better and um so just keep her up in prayer i believe that god can be them lungs you know amen amen anyone else has testimony brother freddie god bless your sins i want to give this testimony a thing usually i don't give testimony but i know god is doing a love in my life so today i went to the doctor appointment i was diagnosed with high blood pressure so most of time my pressure is like 160 by 100 so i don't know why but since last time brother polly can give his testimony what the lord has done for to his life with his blood pressure issue i told him that hey just pray for me i have the same issue the doctor wants me to keep taking a medicine but i don't like to take it because every time when you take this kind of medicine you have to the sad effect you have to take a different medicine so there was keeping adding medicine so last time i decided i said i have to hold to leave everything away and keep praying so today i went with my wife for they checked my blood pressure it was 138 but i think 70 something that's the first time it's been a long time it's been a long time they know me that's my blood pressure is always 160 by 100 but i don't have no symptom so at the end the doctor said even though it's 138 by 100 you have to keep taking the medicine but in my heart i was like okay i have to keep praying so i can that blood pressure can go below so that's the solution i thank god for that thank you praise the lord amen that actually gives me a testimony myself every time i either go for a checkup or if i go to like one of those blood pressure pressure machines i always get it blinking red and it always says like danger and it's like up and way above one sick i mean it's bad and uh people like you need to go get that checked i'm like no your machine's broken your machine's broken every time i say i'm like your machine's broken and actually i was talking to a couple nurses in chicago that i know you you all know dorkishuboa is lydia out in chicago we were with that group out there and i was telling dorcas about and she's like there's no way so we went to a cvs and i used the machine and it said 180. and she's like you need to go to the hospital i was like no the machine's broken i've been saying it for years i don't know i break a bunch of machines so don't let me

the grace of god we're here so there should be a great blessings waiting for us amen i can't pass on this but brother gerard we really really appreciate you being here tonight amen amen that's one of the local elder here i told him i say if i knew he should be the one preaching here now i'm going to preach in front of an elder so it's not my fault by god's grace lord's willing if the lord's terry may be in the future we will have a time and he will come and be a blessing to the church amen so we really really truly appreciate you being here stopping by showing your support and we know that we got big brothers amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture tonight thank you i hope everybody is on board since sunday nobody is behind all right amen blessed be the name of the lord we got question and answer coming up one after the other so i can't wait for you to have your cod book so you dig on a cod book you listen to the tip you dig on the bible so when we meet together for question and answer we're traveling left and right before you know it your muscles will be really really really big amen blessed be the name of the lord brother david will start working on this but we on part 32 so it keeps saying the same title but the theme the help that we have been dealing with sometime is different so if you click the link on youtube i don't know when he's going to start this and there will be a title first but there is an arrow that's a description or something like that when you click on the description it will tell you the theme whether we spoke about the high heel whether we spoke about the nail whether we spoke about the long hair whatever was being has been ministering that day you're gonna see it so that that way it's gonna be easier for somebody to track it amen versus going through the numbers sometimes we might be speaking about something else and different amen there was a couple questions that came out and i answered them privately to the individual that asked me but if couple people have that question that means maybe somebody else in the church have it so i was studying something through that line and it seems like the holy spirit brought that thing back again to me so we will touch up on certain things that we already went through a little bit just to tighten some bolt amen and make sure nobody is staying behind this time nobody we're not going to leave even a hoof we all going by the grace of god amen let's go to number chapter 31. we started on sunday we stopped with the earring and i was uh reading brother brown i'm standing along the line of what we have been ministering what branham says that if you didn't know it before he said most of these trouble the mess that we have about our attire the way we we we wear our clothing and things brother branham say it comes from the wrong teaching it's the way people were taught they were not taught properly and what random say but for those that are in the tabernacle if you continue to do it while you have been taught then you become guilty of it amen so whatever you didn't know before we minister here the lord sees that but since we already minister and if you continue wearing long nails and high heel and you don't want to trim your nail you don't want to check your your clothing you don't want to do this thing at this point now you become guilty amen because you know better if you're still wearing your earring we demonstrated to you by the prophet by the bible that hearing is wrong it's a sign of hedonism if you continue doing it at this time you'll become guilty of it and you're going to be judged for it amen so your blood is no longer under my hand amen number 31 verse 6. if you dare you can say amen remember last sunday no marriage between israelite and those in the land of canaan amen no marriage verse six and moses sent them to war the children of israel a thousand of every tribe dem and fanihas the son of eliaser the priest to war with the holy instrument and the trumpet to blow in his hand and the war against the midianite remember those women as long as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the water because the male are the carrier of the seed for some reason they didn't sue the women they slew the men what are they going to do to the women remember no marriage between an unbeliever and a believer no marriage between any young man here or any sister here with somebody who's not born again and believe the message of brother branham no marriage you bring it i'm not going to marry you i already told you amen bless the name of the lord brother branham said the success for the success of dwight moody ministry because he was telling the people the truth amen just straight ahead amen verse 8 and they slew the king of media beside the rest of them they were slain namely eva and ricam and zur and er and reba five kings of median balamond saw the son of beer they slew with the sword amen you might be seated verse 9 and the children of israel took all the women of median captive and dele and their little one and took the spoil of all their caddo and all the flock and their goods everybody cleared so far job to verse 14. and moses was angry with the officers of the host not with the people first but with those that are responsible moses got angry because you went with the people you were responsible for the people how did they get into this mess when israel produced the golden calf moses came straight to aaron to the ministry what happened amen and moses was angry that's a prophet with the officers of the host with the captain over thousand and captain over 100 which came from the battle and moses said to them have you saved all the women alive in other words they should be killed as well what are you going to do with them amen verse 16 behold these calls the children of israel through the cancer of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of people you went to wall you killed all the male you killed balaam who was responsible for that teaching but you left the women that were already anointed by that anointing of belem to seduce the children of israel and on sunday we see that there is no marriage that should be taking place between israel and the tribe that were in the promised land amen he said to commit trespass against the lord in the mother appeal and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord in other words you didn't learn we went through this you went and mingled together with strange women remember solomon and you got in trouble and it seems like you have been given a test the second time but you didn't learn to go back again and do the same thing the lord said do not marry with them amen why remember on sunday because their women will turn your heart away from god no matter what you do solomon tried and it was that safe the lord it happened amen now dear therefore kill every male among the little one they kept the children but the male the carrier of the seed kill them because if you leave them they grow up you want to bring that seed back again remember how the serpent seed crossed into the orca because somebody carried the seed amen now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every water every woman that has known men by lying with him everybody that was touched by those strangers don't bring her into israel why remember on sunday you are not equipped enough to handle the women of the world amen you stay with your women not the women of the world you are not equipped to handle them amen blessed be the name of the lord verse 18 but all the women children those that have not been touched in other words those that are virgin you see now all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourself everybody clear so far so you know why he told them stop the other one because you're going to bring that pollution back into the camp amen let's go to deuteronomy chapter 20. blessed be the name of the lord the median and women women cause trouble to the camp of israel god killed many people and never forget that never forgive that sin and they went back again to test again and they fail amen deuteronomy chapter 20 verse 12. if you dare you can say amen remember those were the medianite women under the teaching the anointing of berlin which is just nothing but a another form of jezebel a morphe amen remember we went through that verse 12. if you dare you can say amen and if and if it will make no peace with you but will make war against you then you shall be sieged talking about a city amen and when the lord your god has delivered it into your hand deliver a city unto your hand you shall smite water every male thereof with the edge of the sword we don't want carrier of the scene kill him but the women come out and the little ones and the caddo and all that is in the city even all the spoiled thereof shall you take to yourself and you shall eat the spoil of your enemy what they did on number because that's exactly what it did or number moses was angry because women caused trouble to the camp of israel before brother branham said they begin to dance and world and when israel look remember on sunday they seen a whim women that were different than the israelites you can't go back that road anymore amen blessed be the name of the lord verse 15 thus shall you do to all the cities which are very what very far off from you in other words you're going in the land of canaan remember the land of canaan have inhabited already and we demonstrated to you that those inhabitants were from the seed of cain brother branham explained that amen so when you go to the promised land do not marry anybody in the promised land but if you go to war not with the people of the promised land the people that are far away because those in the promised land carry the serpentine remember very specific thus verse 15 shall you do to all the cities which are very far not in the land of israel from you which are not of the cities of this water i don't want you to mingle with israel so when you go with the cities that are already in the land of israel whether it's a woman or a male whether it's a virgin or what kill everybody don't leave nothing but if the city is very far away in other words the city is not under the influence of the inhabitant of the land of canaan at that point take only the virgins make sense now amen thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off from you which are not the cities of this nation verse 16 but of the series of the people which the lord your god does give you for an inheritance remember this on sunday you shall save a love water kill everything nothing that breathes but you shall orderly destroy them namely the high tide and the homo right the canaanite and the parasite they have fight and the jebusite as the lord your god has commanded you why verse 18 that they teach you not to do after all their abomination which they have done to their god so should you sin against so should you sin against the lord jeopard there is something about the canaanite women brother branham said from the lineage of can domingo with them amen and we sin that cain that's where the anointing of jezebel came from amen let's go to deuteronomy 21 then we're going to pray amen the medianite kill him because the wrong influence under the teaching of bellum those that are very far away not under the influence get on in the virgin not the other one because you're not equipped to handle them deuteronomy 21 verse 10 if you dare you can say amen this is the scripture we use for long nails amen verse 13 verse 12. but we said it should be ten when you go forth to war against your enemy another one and the lord your god has delivered them this is right after deuteronomy 20. now he give more specific he get more specific and the lord your god has delivered them into your hands and you have taken them captive remember the women are taken captive and see among their captive a beautiful woman not those in the land of canaan because those in the land of canaan you killed them amen these are far away if you see a beautiful woman and have a desire to her that you should have her for your lover you see now not to play with it for your wife it's a covenant then you shall bring her home to your house and she shall shave her head why does this woman have to shave her head number one shave her head what was in that woman here that needed to be shaved amen praise god amen number two and pear or trim her nail we already talked about this sister are not supposed to have long nails even the little beauty that the devil trying to tell you get them off amen even your cdc will tell you that amen verse 13 and she shall put the remnant of her captivity from off of her that remnant here have to come off and shall remain in your house and beware her husband okay somebody is not sleeping and beware her father and mother a full month not her husband because those that has been touched what do you do to them you kill them father and mother because she's still under the headship of the father she's still virgin these these are the ones you handle everybody clear now read between the between the line her father and her mother a full month and after that you shall go into her and be her lover her husband and she shall be your wife in other words she got to go through the transformation she got to be born again amen she got up died from her birth of her father and mother died again completely amen shrimp da hedonism away from her and shave the head what was in the head that needed to be shaved amen now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father i know how the devil fought lord father today lord to make this service difficult but by your grace you always and will always overcome law father lord you open the door lord and you have been a blessing to us lord we are committing this entire church and those that are streaming online unto their hand lord father made the holy spirit come down and minister to your children may you open the windows of heaven one more time and pour your blessings lord may the devil in his army be completely sealed out of this place and father may you bring us in a more closer relationship with you as we humbly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen praise the name of the lord on sunday we read this scripture with you on second corinthians chapter 6 verse 14 to 18. i just want to brush to this quickly be not an equally yolk together with unbelievers clear for what fellowship there is no fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness the righteousness are the children of god because we become the righteousness of god by accepting christ amen with the unrighteous which are the unbeliever and what communion have light with darkness amen jesus said i am the light of the world and he turned again he said you are the light of the world amen so we are the children of light we must reflect that light and not be in communion with darkness everybody so far and what conquer there is no agreement that has christ with belial and what part has he that believed with an infidel they don't even believe your god you're not going to convert them you're not going to change them amen they don't want to learn about you just like jezebel she entered different than ruth ruth wanted to die from her god help people everything else and be partaker of the commonwealth of israel through their religion amen but jezebel want to enter the congregation but still keep their old life and what agreement has the temple of god which you are with adults so these women are adults you hear american adults for you are the temple of the living god as god have said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separated say the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you god want or call for a total separation with what unbelief everything that has a threat of hidden completely separates yourself from that everybody clear so far so we on part 32 amen on sunday we were dealing with jezebel we dealt with her spiritually on revelation 17 and on revelation 18 we are still dealing with her naturally amen we found out that there were three major key with jezebel her induction was through forbidden marriage it was not like roof we explained you this on sunday and once you get the spirit of jezebel it revolves the old pollution that you escaped that's why during the reign of ahab jericho was rebuilt back again amen once you go back that route automatically your old life will come back up again amen and jezebel also bring hiddenism or pagan custom that's what we talk about the painting of the nail and everything now brother branham says this this is still very important he said now what a difference in this day in this day of conception instead of him being her ruler this is a problem in america she has become his god remember the temple of the lord and adult she becomes a god sure she rules him under no circumstances a woman should be the ruler of the home let me drive this and then you will see now you can probably well understand what i have been hitting it buy her water remember those three elements very important number one brother branham say by her beauty amen and number two by her sex control that's why you don't marry a woman outside that has been touched by a man you don't know how to handle it amen but by her beauty and her sex control and her water and her ship number three by beauty we know that we're talking about the face amen by sex control we know what it means and by shape we're talking about the body form and when we're going to get under the high heel you're going to see that there is two specific area that these work they work on the torso the chest amen and the second one is going to work on the waist this is what your high heel does to you i will prove it on sunday if the lord willing i don't know why i tried to get it and there's still a blockage amen somebody said brother stephen wait till i come back and you can minister that so by her beauty and her sex control her shape that was given to her by who so you must be very careful not to try and very careful on this area your beauty must be natural amen blessed be the name of the lord they byproduct that certainty she is sent to deceive the sons of god and she can sway more of them to hell than any other instrument satan has got in other words this is the top instrument of satan this is the top amen this is the top the top weapon and this reflects the church whatever you see in the women that's exactly what is happening in the church amen that is exactly right i am talking off any more of the immoral now in other words an immoral woman is a woman that will try to control a man by her beauty can you say amen by his sex control and by her sheep you're not supposed to control a man by this a man should be controlled by the holy ghost and peter said that a woman should have a good life so that by your life not by your preaching you can convert a husband that does not know the lord so you are controlling your husband by the life of christ in your life anybody clear i am talking of the immoral now not you sisters we shall give your place right place in a few minutes in the word of the god of the lord here everybody clear now in second king chapter 9 verse 30 last week last sunday the bible says that when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it she heard that a man was coming and she did three things number one she did water she painted her face this is sunday uh wednesday so let me go up slowly she painted her face brother branham said she's controlling by water which is the face you understand now she painted her face number two she did water she tired her head and we're gonna see what i mean tonight and number three she did water she looked out to the window you wonder why your internet was called window do you think they did it just by any chance amen and she painted her face and tired her head and look out at the window this painting of the face have a purpose what is the purpose of it jeremiah 4 verse 30 and when they are spoiled what will that do though that closet that self with crimson remember peter and paul were against costly apparel you remember that when they were talking about a prostituted woman though you deck deal with ornament of water remember peter and paul both say costly apparel gold and silver and then they talk about the hair amen now do that deck is deal with ornament of gold though that went test that face with water this was speaking about the children of israel israel did not have a custom to paint their face but for some reason this anointing entered into the congregation of israel and the daughter of zion found themselves doing these kind of things but what is the purpose of painting your face jezebel though directed that face with water painting in vain shall they make the self white for who so the painting of the face is to increase the element of beauty that's why brother branham said the beauty of the women increased so much and the max factor those that make those powder and everything are making so much money because the children of god the sons of god will begin to fulfill the the prophecy that was in the time of noah as he was in the days of noah so shall it be the days of the son of man when the sons of god begin to look at the daughters of men they care night that they were beautiful what made those came out beautiful because they have the art to increase the beauty this beauty is not what they have it's an artificial beauty it is a beauty that looks good on facebook it looks good on whatsapp it looks good on instagram but the day you marry her you put her in your home she doesn't look anything like the picture you love it first that's why brother branham said if you want to get married to a woman go see her on her watch day when she's working in the kitchen when she's at home when she has not put all the powder then you know what you're getting you might think she has a light skin you're gonna be deceived just like jacob was deceived one time amen so the purpose to do this is a purpose to please a lover that's why jezebel painted her face because a man was coming so when you do paint your face to put your picture on the internet according to god you wander a spirit of adultery amen and you don't do it remember naked and don't know it and no if not remember that and on the day of judgment you're gonna be responsible for all the men that you have been attracting on the internet amen it is a shame to see a married woman presenting her breasts amen you put a profile and when you look at the profile there is a breast that has been augmented a certain way why do you have to show up your torso you already married them you want us to like it amen blessed be the name of the lord the second thing is tie your head what does he mean brother bonham said so we found jezebel towering her head which was water so the tiring of the head means the cutting of hair what does cutting a hair have to do why was this woman shaven make sense remember paul is he clicking which was cutting her hair rolling it up tiring her head which is a water that's why even a wig for a sister you cannot wear a wig that have the appearance of cutting off of a haircut once you do that you under you are portraying a demonic spirit a jezebel spirit everything you do must be close to nature because that's the way god created you remember we created you wonderfully and everything you must stay appreciate and remain the way god created you if god wanted you to be tall he would have made you tall if god made you short don't put on high heel a woman that cut her hair dishonor her husband the bible said so a dishonorable woman should be divorced and put away so that is a son that she loves somebody water when you cut or you trim your hair maybe you are not aware of it but what god interprets in your life you are telling god you're under a spirit of adultery according to the bible because she dishonor her husband when she does it painted face jezebel now here paint and scissor that cuts your hair that bothers you it is not really the material whatever happened in the natural is just a reflection of a spirit remember on sunday everything that moved moved by spirit amen so it's not really depending it's not really what you do to your hair it's not really what you do to your nail what what gives you the desire to have long nail why you don't want to have short nail why you are the only one that is attracted to make your nail grow what is that thirst coming from that's the key brother bonham say he and the paint and scissors that cuts your head that bothers you it is that spirit in you that make you go get it so it's a demonic spirit that you have been playing around with it and it's that spirit that drives you to do these kind of things and god will judge you by the desire because your desire entertain that demon if you don't like it that demon will go away but as long as you are pleased with it that's the reason why we have been catering condoning or keeping demon for years because of her heart condition that's why malachi 4 comes to turn the water not the head many people have their head turned but not the heart that's why they are living contrary to the message because their heart was never touched it is that spirit in you that makes you go get it that is what it is max factor what do we call it today america there we go thank you you're not you're your modern american mary kay could make all of it he wanted to and lay it over there and if you was a christian you shall never do what in other words if the holy spirit is in you the holy spirit will blocking you will block you from going that route so no matter what the world will do your protection is under the token if the token is in your life it's gonna remove the desire because the worshiper once purged have no more desire for sin amen what the people were doing they were coming in the message under a law and they were trying with their effort amen to leave the message and after a while you're going to blow up it might take 20 years you're going to blow up because you never made it to the person of christ but once the worshiper is purging amen the message becomes a joy it become a peace it becomes something that is your life it is no more a law it is no more a prison you just live like the messenger amen and sometimes you might find yourself doing something and you don't even have a quote and one day you're going to read it you say oh i see it here i didn't know brother but i'm talking about it because you became the message hallelujah hallelujah enough with that word that kind of way amen if you are not where you are supposed to be with the lord don't fool yourself it is homegoing town don't fool yourself with a proud spirit humble yourself amen before the word of god and seek the holy spirit because the showdown has come amen don't worry don't worry don't worry you can work for one week and you are good i'm trying to be good i'm trying to be good and the lord send the test again before you go up you blow up again it is showing you something is not correct there amen amen oh i'm sorry honey i'm sorry i won't do it again by the grace of god i'm going to change you're going to turn pages after prejudice people have been doing this at the end of the year years after year next year i'm going to do this is still not working because the man thing have not been touched amen if you was a christian you never touch it i mean if you was baptized with the holy ghost and living where you are to live that's right and your pastor preached water this pulpit only the message of the hour as pure as he was given i will never by the grace of god don't push me to compromise i'm going to tell you what brother brother i'm saying amen your pastor preached the truth and let you know about it you would not even want him care about it in other words if that thirst is still there if you're still struggling with that thirst it is a signal that something is still wrong put your life in order anybody clear so far now brother brother just explained to us that the tearing of the head is a cutting of the hair what does he mean getting that scissor and cutting it praise the name of the lord amen what is wrong with a woman cutting her hair amen you said cutting hair what is that got to do brother let's stop here just a minute i feel i just feel somebody resented that might have been out on the wire somewhere maybe somebody's streaming listen a hair to a woman is a nazarite vow held to samson was a nazarite vow samson was a man everybody clear and when a woman cuts off her hair she absolutely denies her nazarite vow that she is a bride to her if you don't look at this clearly you're going to get confused brother branham is dealing with a woman in two ways as a church you follow me and as an individual which is a woman herself the person anybody clear keep those two in mind because he said go home and study amen and when a woman cuts off her hair she absolutely denies her nazarite vow that she is the bride of who we're right here in the church amen because there that one thing she support the whole picture how can one thing denies you amen correctly a nazirite is one that is consecrated for a purpose remember we showed you that god created you for a purpose is that right samsung was consecrated to an age and to a purpose therefore he had long hair he had to destroy the philistine the woman that is a child of god let her grow to show that she is consecrated to water every word of god when you catch your hair you are rebelling against the word of god i want this to soak in so you never let somebody bring a caesar close to you amen if she cut it off i don't care how much she dances pentecostal sings is in the choir speaks in tongue runs up and down or has all kind of added society she is what that is when you catch your hair sister from now on you are spiritually dead god serve the lord the word of god first corinthians 14 here she has denied her nazarite vow and sought out to the god of this water the god of jezebel she does it now shame on you lady or woman brother brother why so strong amen and our pentecostal women like that that is too bad that is too bad shame sister there is a letdown somewhere and i hope it is not in the pulpit because usually that's where it started when a clergy when a pastor does not believe what he preaches that's what you have amen remember what a woman is to be she is very what so sister if you have an arrogant spirit something is wrong i hope the whole church was filled today i was talking to someone today when rebecca come to meet isaac did you notice she veiled her face they still do it they don't know what they are doing but the bride veils her face why the man is ahead keep this in mind when we get to correction you're gonna see the nature of a woman is to yield to a man not to control by sex by beauty and worship and that is the reason the church should be veiled you remember i told you brother branham dearly with individual and he goes up to the church about clear that is the reason the church should be there it's got a head that is water so now spiritually speaking the head of a woman is crossed which is the head of the church anybody clear individually that's your husband if you're not married that is your father if you need the scripture you see me amen the woman is supposed to wear long hair because of her head husband hey which is her what you see her brother brother move up and down amen he is to have short hair because of christ we're going to get to that the woman well longs hair because of the angel i thought he was a husband now it's angel praise god hallelujah what is the angel the water do you know who your messenger is right the messenger a true messenger to the church you see how brother branham goes back up again you see individual life the church of god universally and he has also included something that is called the church age your age your church age the head is the messenger at home your head is your husband you follow me and for the church age in your local church the head is the pastor in your church age now the head is the messenger you follow me that's why brother branham said the seven messenger were pastors you understand now and for the bride entirely from ephesus all the way to laodicea the head is crushed you understand now so we go by christ the messenger the pastor and the husband amen follow me the messenger as a follower who and you pastor you must stay under your messenger and husband stay under the pastor that is under the messenger who was under christ can i repeat that again can i repeat that again you have christ anybody clear daniel messenger dan your local pastor dan your husband or your father amen christ must reflect himself through the messenger and the messenger and his message become one you follow me then the messenger will reflect christ to the local church everybody then the pastor must reflect also christ on the pulpit then the husband must be crushed in your home relax you want to get married you want to be close to your wife be christ first before you get married when your husband when your wife look at you they must see christ i'm gonna prove to you by the scripture amen what is the angel the messenger a true messenger to the church that's right he will always call it down and say it is wrong and so forth and the church to be so yielded to jesus that he don't claim its own head you see how he goes up and down its own headship christ is the headship of the you see that right here amen fell we are not our own but we are his yielded to him and him alone how beautiful everybody clears so far now let's go to number six brother branham say it's a nazarite vow where is that coming from number chapter six if you dare you can say amen the head is crossed then your messenger your messenger will point you to christ then your local pastor your local pastor must be under the messenger amen and must be faithfully taught to get the light from the messenger and to spread it up and to only repeat what the messenger said because it's not the messenger it is christ number chapter six if you're there you can say amen verse two speak to the children of israel and say to them when either what man man is a he or a woman she is a she everybody know that praise the name of the lord when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite to separate themselves to the lord he who is he why is he not talking about she why didn't he say they the bible says man or woman when the bible begins to give a description he begins to only talk about the man why not the woman hallelujah three he no she shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink we already preached to you those three things that the angel of the lord spoke to brother branham don't smoke wine and women remember we already went through that amen neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried on the day of her separation he's thank you somebody's awake he's separation shall she eat not a woman he eats nothing that is made of a van tree from the colonels even to the house all the days of the vow of her know his separation there shall no razor come upon his water number one no wine nothing connected to wine we already explained you wine number two the hair of the man nazarite not the woman amen no razor shall come upon his head until the day be fulfilled into which he separate himself to the lord he shall be water holy and shall let the locks of him of the hair of his head do what grow verse 6 oh the day that he separate himself to the lord he shall come at no dead body no pollution he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consequence of god is upon his water and nazarite the consecration is on the head and the head has held so the son of a nazarite amen was upon the head and that sun was the hair of the head anybody clear remember jezebel cut her hair we clear verse 8 all the day of his separation he is holy to who to the lord let's get an example here judges chapter 13 verse 3 and 5. and the angel of the lord appear unto the woman and say unto her behold now thou are barren not but that shall conceive and bear a wiper a man or a woman we're dealing with a man about here now therefore be aware of prey and drink not water we just read it with you about clear now drink not wine no strong drink we read it with you and eat not any unclean thing ever here for love that shall conceive and bear a son not a woman and no razor shall come on his water everything that was spoken by moses was given as an instruction to the parent to the mother of samson because god stays behind his word everybody clear for the child amen shall be a water a nazareth unto god from the womb anybody clear that's why brother branham could tap samson as a type of church understand because the church in the bible brother bradham said it is type as a woman amen but when brother branham preached the saved church by the world he used samson as a top of the church because samsung had a nazarite vow on his head and his hair looked longer like a woman a church and an individual we clear for the child shall be a nazareth brother branham said he even looked like a because of the hair not that he was a sisi for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb it was consecrated from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistine then the woman came and kept the secret to her husband a married woman should always tell her husband everything a married woman should not handle stuff on herself outside of the marriage with men without her husband knowing [Music] you don't have any private life your life and your husband's life are together your husband should not be surprised if somebody tells him that your wife did so and so even if you messed up come back like eve and bring it back home then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not once he was neither told him told him me his name but he says unto me behold that shall conceive and bear a son and now no drink no wine no strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazareth to god from the womb right here to the day of his water his entire life samson was a nazarite and the son of an azeroth the way you recognize him it was not because he was a man there is only one thing that makes you know that a man has been a nazareth it is his hair because a woman automatically should have long hair so you don't know whether she is under that consecration or not it was usually detected by men make sense that's why they give a description for the man not the woman everybody clear let's go to judges 16 hallelujah amen because at the end if you read the bible says when these days of nazareth are done he's going to go and do what and cut his head the bible never spoke about the woman because if you put the woman there then the woman can cut her hair then paul is under contradiction make sense but he never touched the woman because the man is not good for a man to have long hair that's why at the end of his nazarite he must cut it off but not description for the woman because other medically she's always have long hair you can tell that's why the description is only to the man and the only example given in the bible was a man's son make sense now i'm going slowly so you understand why brad branham is against this thing and when you soak him you will never do that again let's go to judges chapter 16. because we got demons on the land that are killing people it should be in the bible it should be in the bible okay if you know the message very well the message came from the bible so now let's grind you in the bible back it up with brother branham amen judges like paul say we preach christ according to the revelation of the mystery you preach christ according to the message of the hour let's go judges 16 verse 1 if you dare you can say amen what did god told israel when they came out of egypt do not marry what strange women do not mess around with them stay away judges chapter 16. remember solomon on sunday he went after strange women that's why the entire book of proverbs all over strange women oh how wisdom will protect you from strange women because solomon learned he got burned pretty good amen judges 16 verse 1 then went samson together forbidden and so there was a water remember jezebel spirit in revelation she was the great a harlot which is the spirit on the end time now samsung goes to a harlot amen and azerite going to a harlot and then went samson to gaza and saw there a harlot and went into her everybody clear jump to verse four and he came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of israel makes sense not an israelite in the valley of sorek whose name was dilala god said don't do it he carry his nazar advan and move on to that and the lord of the philistine came unto him and said to her entice him and see wherein his great strength lies and by what means we may prevail against him that we may burn him to afflict him and we will give you every one of us 1100 pieces of water money the root of all evil this woman loved money amen in verse 4 the bible says samson loved her young people you think you love her let's see if she loves you you there verse 6 and delilah said to samson tell me i pray you wearing your great strength lies and where if you might be bound to do what who is a normal woman in the world that can ask your husband i want to know how do you make money i want to know where is the strong where is the strength of your business and i want to know how we can destroy your business can you imagine can you imagine and samsung loves her but do you think when a woman asks that question samson will walk up and say wait a minute this is not a good woman i need to run away with it right that's what you think young people you think you're going to be able to detect a jezebel you're not going to be you're you're not going to be able to be able you will not equip for that amen normally a normal man when they ask you a question you want to go home you say maybe at your job you say wait a minute this woman is asking me where is my power to be destroyed what what is she looking after samson didn't work like that why that's why god said do not go to those women because there is power in those women to turn you away from me you're not going to overcome the only thing is the holy spirit but the holy spirit will block you even to go there amen verse seven and simpson said to her if they burned me we still under the nazareth if you're sleeping you can wake up but you can stand up there and samsung said to her if they bind me with seven green wishes that will never dry you begin to lie because you're already living an unclean life one demon after another and then shall i be weak and be as another man then the lords of the philistine brought up to her seven green wishes which has now been drive and she burned him with them now there were men lying in weight a burning with her in the water this is what you get for me an outside woman amen a man you think you're under a relationship but people are living with you in the house they might not be physically there but open her cell phone and look how many men she has in contact with amen a married woman friends on facebook that are men why why she loves samsung let's see if samsung will wake up and say enough i need to go back to israel amen and she said to him that philistine be upon you some son and he broke the wisdom as a thread of town is broken when he touches fire so his strength was not known you told a woman your secret and in the morning and night she goes and she binds you and she tells you the philistine has upon you you woke up you found yourself bound and you break the bond but you still care come back to your mind like this woman asked me a secret i told her and she bind me you see how stupid the devil can get you do you see do you see stay behind the word amen verse 10 and delilah said to samson behold you have mocked me and told me lies you're a liar you message believer you see now you start lying you're living already under fornication what kind of sanctification do you express amen you were mocked me and told me lies now tell me i pray you where if you might be bound samson should stay enough what are you looking in my life let's see samsung and he said to her if they burn me with fast with new rope that never will occupy then i shall be weak and as another man what did she do she did it again did something change let's go to 15 to save time and she said to him how can you say i love you when you're working the woman understood that this is a player his heart is not with me the heart that god is hunting through the ministry of brother branham the same heart the harlot is hunting it remember in the book of proverbs we showed you that the harlot is calling and which them also is calling folly's calling wisdom is calling she understood that i'm still dealing with him intellectually let me get to the root how do i get into the root under the laws of god watch him your heart is not with me you have mocked me this water three times you still don't wake up what power is in this woman that i'm son of god cannot be cannot be awake from a danger remember she's controlling by water everybody can understand and she's controlling by water and by water once you uncontrol under this your brain don't function normal they will tell you leave that woman alone she's not converted yet and you see a young man keep pushing keep pushing keep pushing because he's blundered by the shape of the woman he's blunded by the beauty he cannot even sit and think and say this woman he doesn't have a good character no he's blinded by beauty sex control by shape you can say all you want mama i still want her she's not a message believer she's so sweet we showed you in proverbs those women are sweeter sweeter than honey amen you have mocked me these three times and have not told me wherein your great strength lies about here and it came to pass when she pressed him out daily with her words and urged him put him under pressure so that his what finally the door to the heart the soul open up was vexed to death that he told her all his heart and said to her there was no come there there has not come a razor upon my what the nazareth is open for i have been a welcome now say hi to who to god from my mother's womb and if i be saved then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and be like any other man and when delala saw that he told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistine say come up this one for he had shown me all his heart then the lords of the philistine came up to her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon water how did she make samsung sleeper you don't need a sleep pills she's controlling you by her body by her beauty by her shape what happened to samson three times brother branham said those three times shows luther wesley pentecost are you there and finally the church was getting under satan and what did they do they blinded him because laodicea is enter the territory of the devil everybody clear everybody clear jump to verse 22 however he the hair of his head began to grow again after he was what they shave him completely when they shave samson you follow me the power is gone when they cut the hair the power is gone the consecration is gone and it takes the power away what is wrong in the hair amen amen let's go to first corinthian 11 then i will stop a certain time then we will continue let's go now to first corinthian 11. you understand jezebel towering her head we already talked about the painted face she cut her hair what is important about this brother bottom explained to us about the head of the church being crushed the head of the church ages the messenger in your home your husband or your father if you are not married in your church the pastor and then the shaving of the head the nazarite vow is a son to man in the head ever clear and the woman as well but a woman is hard to tell because she already have long hair let's go to first quarantine 11 now i have to build this up so you understand first corinthians 11. you ready now let's get this now let you go home be ye followers of me remember this we talked about them me who paul paul was there messenger you understand now be your followers of me the messenger even as i am also follower of what of who crossed you see this now it makes sense it's clear verse 2 now i praise you brethren that you remember me in all things let me read it again i praise you present that you remember jesus in all things is that what he says remembering who remembering the messenger in everything everything in your life you must check it with the word of your day you want to do something did you check the word or you just take a decision because it is my life amen and keep the ordinance as i have as i delivered them to who why do we have to keep the ordinance exactly like paul gave it remember jericho remember those two boys that went there brother branham said they played what a man playing tapes was tapes over there you remember what we spoke on sunday the tape became human amen when they speak they like a tape they are just repeating what the messenger said they don't have any thought of their own because the thought of the messenger is not really the thought of the messenger it is the thought of christ keep this right here i'm going to come back drop to verse 23 why do we have to keep it just like paul gave it for i have wanted receive of who that which also i did what so why did paul get this information now let's go back again let's go back again now verse two now i praise you president that you remember me in all things keep the ordinance as i did what but paul just told us that what he delivered he gathered from who that's why you keep it exactly like he was given because it's not coming from a man it's coming from god it is we are not feeding upon the word of man but we are feeling informed there and failing by the word of the son of man make sense i deliver them unto you watch now verse three but i would have you know that the head of every man is who watch here make sense thank you come on and the head of every man is christ and the head of every woman is who do you see what i gave you here make sense now clear come up and the head of christ is who if you look here it looks like we have four people brother branham question and answer followers of me as i am of christ paul said you follow me just as i follow why is brother branham saying that read between the line now i praise you brethren that you remember me in all things and keep off the ordinance as i delivered unto you but i would have you to know that the head of every man is who and the head of the woman is who and the head of christ is who see how it is who god man four people god is perfected in what why do we have forward you ready let's get this and we go home the head of christ is god that's what paul said and the head of the man is crust and the head of the woman is the man so the bottom line is the woman and the top is who when we spoke about wisdom and understanding are you ready now just get ready and we're going to go home god we found out that god was portrayed as the understanding you remember that somebody missed this everybody clear then we found that christ was the wisdom of god you follow me it is not really through four people it is actually true i who the wisdom of god is who christ our wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty invention counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am water so wisdom and understanding are water i am a father as well the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his work of old i was set up from water from the beginning the jehovah of the old testament is jesus in the new testament when there were no depth i was brought forth we explained to you this as a logos when there was no front and a bonding with water before the mountain was settled before the hills i was brought forth in other words i was birthed when he prepared the heaven i was dead when he set that a compass upon the face of the death then i was by him as one brought up with water through the process of kinosis and in more faith than god changed from the spirit into the pillar of fire everybody follow me and i was dealing his delight rejoicing always before that's why brother branham said he was playing like a child brother branham never give you a scripture perfectly in line with the scripture everybody clear so god and christ are water we don't have four people we have three people make sense now thank you now he revealed that deep and the secret thing he know if word is in darkness and the light dwelleth with who because god was a spirit we know that but that spirit in more faith into a light i already preached on this and that light was the logos which was the pillar of fire anybody clear you already know that psalm 104 somebody asked this question bless the lord all my soul oh lord my god they are very great there are clubs with water honor and majesty who cover up that self with water remember when jesus was taken up he entered into a cloud which was the pillar of cloud in the night the pillar of fire i came from god i'm going back to god you understand now first timothy 6 that that keeps this commandment with us part are rebukable until the appear of who our lord jesus christ which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and the only water patented the king of kings the lord of lords who only has water immortality melchizedek dwelling in the water everybody clear in the light which no man can approach whom no man has seen nor can what see so god dwell in the light everybody clear in the beginning was the and the word was with and the word was water god and cluster the same was in the beginning wisdom all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made in him was water and the life was the light offer john 1 14 and the word was made water now it's no more the pillar of fire it becomes a human being the pillar of fire took on skinner and the world was made water and dwell among us and we behead his water the glory as the only begotten after he was birth the logos and when he was birthed the logos by kenosis when he comes out he pick up god and he put god in him do you understand kenosis is not this are you there kinosis is this you follow me so when god was birthing christ christ means the fullness of god so as christ was coming out of the bosom of god he also picked god with him and he sack him great is the mystery of godliness the word was made flesh and dwell among us and we behead his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth no man has seen god at any time the only word begotten of the son the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father has declared him so he came as a kingsman you follow me hallelujah wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice an offering that would not but a what the pillar of fire needed a body that has prepared me first corinthians 2 corinthians 4 4. in whom the god of this world has branded the mind of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of who come out who is the water colossian 1 14 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the water of the invisible water the firstborn among every so jesus was god manifested in flesh everybody clear hallelujah yes in this last day spoken to us by his word whom he has appointed air of all things by whom also he made the wisdom who bring the water brightness of his and the express image of water oh my god again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he said let all his god let all the angel of god do what why do you worship the son but unto the son he said that throne oh son [Music] his name shall be called water counselor you calling a son mighty god everlasting what how can a son be everlasting father again but unto the son he said that throne oh so that son is a god hallelujah that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have and our hand have handed the water the logos was handled in the person of jesus christ for their life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with who and was manifested unto us and then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is what and in him there is no water so he is a king's man and he is also your brother god has love righteousness and hated iniquity therefore even who is god therefore god even that god has anointed thee with all of goodness above that he is your brother and lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth remember proverb romans 8 17 if children then water as we flow out of who and do what with who he's your brother ever clear then solomon in proverbs 7 say call wisdom your what your sister and call understanding your water god understanding christ the wisdom through which the supreme intelligence immortal to begin to create then he dropped down and the word was made flesh to become a king's men to become a brother to us then while that was in god he poured into and all that was in class he pour into the and the church becomes the bride when you get into the brad baptist you are also you get your kids to become a king's woman jerusalem that's the church a condescending a condescending right there in first corinthians god christ man woman the spirit of god condescended to the logos all of them become one then from the logos he was made flesh into a man the man is the head of the church you follow me you follow me now and that church is a woman and that woman is the body that's why in sunset mountain when the picture came they turned the picture to the right everything that was in the picture was nothing but the water and that head was who everybody here wife submit yourself and to your husband as unto the what why a woman must respect you like god i'm gonna stop her for a husband is the water you understand now paul this is ephesian even as christ look how paul play with the two the natural and he goes back up to the spiritual the husband is the head of the wife husband and wife even as christ is the head of the church spiritual and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject time to christ spiritual so let the wife natural be still be to their own not somebody else's husband somebody else's husband want his wife to do the hair like this you also want to do your hair like this for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishing even as the lord the spiritual for we are a member of his body remember of his flesh and of his bones for this course shall men leave his father mother and shall be joined unto his wife and the two shall be what this is a great mystery but i speak concerning who and the water makes sense now nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his he goes back again down even as himself and when the wife see that she happens her work let's go to first corinthians back and i finished where was i that was verse two verse three but i would have you that your that the head of every man is who and the head of every woman is who and the head of christ is who we understand the two are one every man praying oh prophesying now we're getting to where we're going having his head covered dishonor his head who is the head of a man what does mean head cover does it mean putting a hat hold on i'm i'm maneuvering to the airport does it mean having the head cut job to verse 14 then we're going to stop somewhere so you hang on to that does not even nature itself teach you that if any man have water so that covering is not a hat it is the only one that was permitted was a nazarite man not the woman amen does not even naturally self teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame to him dishonor but if a woman has long hair it is a water a glory to her for her hair is giving her for a water so long hair for a woman is a covering by the scripture go back again and then we finish verse four every man praying or prophet saying having his head covered in other words having long hair makes sense now dishonor christ makes sense make sense but every woman that prays or prophesy with her head uncovered what is the covering of a woman it's water if her if her head is uncovered what does he mean it is now now you're giving me the answer yourself gender is what cut right clear but every woman that prays or prophesy her head uncovered dishonor her what who is the head of the woman the husband and if we go back in the bread who is the head of the bride do you see the two quotes i gave you at the beginning now it makes sense why brother branham say when you do that you are double sinning when a woman committed adultery she's double sinning she's first sinning against her that's why when that woman committed adultery and confessed to god she keeps suffering suffering until she get to brother branham and brother branham said you committed adultery she said i already asked forgiveness what random say you didn't sin to god you said to your go first corrected with y'all then you go back to who when you cut your hair you are disrespecting both your husband you okay and then you disrespecting god as a member of the bride and you also disrespecting your messenger of the age and you also disrespecting your local pastor who want to cut her hair again you're going to find god with four sins right there let me go back again but every woman that prays or prophesy with her head uncovered cut dishonor her head for that is even all one as if she wear in other words a woman that have hair that looks cut is the same as a woman that does not have hair at all when you go to captivity to war when you fight and you see a woman and that woman is a virgin if you want to get her to a wife tell her to cut her nail because israelite don't keep long nails they don't put a clear coat to play around with the devil young sister it's a law it's a hmong young sister full of them clear coat and make their hair their nail go this way and the second thing shave ahead which is the same as a what the style of cutting her hair cutting hair is a hidden star the style of trimming of having long nails it's a hedonism they're hidden cut their hair they're hidden have long nails they hid them paint their face they hid them paint their eyes remember a holy boy in ezekiel 23 and god wants you to separate from all of that that's why brother branham said not even a caesar should be closed getting into your hair because you're breaking the nazarite valve you're breaking it it's the covering that covering is not what the pentecostal went and put a covering on a woman saying a covering it's a hair you are reflecting the glory and you're going to see why did sarah call abraham my lord because of this i will show it to you but time is gone let's stand father father father daddy when they say the head of the home it doesn't mean that you did chief not what it means let me help you on that i have to give it to you i have to give it to you hallelujah let me see where it is hallelujah go to verse seven for a man indeed ought not to cover his head you don't need long hair for as much as he is the what can you read it as much as he is what the image and the water and the glory of god are you an image and the glory of god in your home daddy daddy online husband are you the image of god and the glory of god in your home because the reason why they told you cut your hair because you are reflecting god so you should be god to your home your wife should see god in you amen your children must look at daddy and see god if they don't have any idea what is god they can look at you and know exactly what a christian should be because you should be you you are already built to reflect the glory of of god as a man because the scripture will say later that the woman will reflect the glory of the man not of god as a bread you're going to reflect the glory of christ but as a married woman you're going to reflect the glory of your husband that's why brother bradham said show me the woman that a man want to marry i will tell you the spirit that is in that man amen people can watch your wife and know what kind of men you are if your wife is always just scared like this something is wrong at home you see a wife joyful she's fun there's something that happened at home that make her like that you see a wife wearing tight dresses amen short clothes and all kind of stuff check sometime it is not the wife somebody have a demon and when they show him he say i don't see anything wrong with my wife i don't see anything wrong with my wife he can't go outside he's controlling himself by laws and he's trying to transform his wife to to be conformed to the image of those women out there to please his folly his passion and it won't work still tomorrow fight tomorrow fight tomorrow fight it is not it is the man the wife is just a reflection you talk to a man he's going to tell you god bless you you know or you call me so and so i prefer for you to call me uh mr so-and-so that's a man talk talk to a woman he doesn't want you to call him like that he wants you to call him she's straight women just straight the men will go like a politician you know what i'm saying we need to go you see what i'm saying the woman goes just straight i didn't like it what is wrong i just didn't like it because she's reflecting clearly what is going on are you the man of your home are you the crust of your home or you just men because you will need the one to pay the bill to decide where the money need to go let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are just delivering what you have handed on to us through the messenger of this age lord and father that we pray that every heart be so open and humble in front of your word to receive exactly that which was given because that's the bomb that you sent to this age to heal your children father may we take this word and go home go on our job and continue to meditate if in our life we are really reflecting you as a bride of jesus christ father many things were done in ignorance because the people were not taught they thought it was just an opinion that somebody can do whatever they want and even ministers came to the place to some of them begin to say we are not in the days of brother branham like the word of god have ages but this word was an eternal word that will continue to remain eternal and true because when you spoke you see it all the time and you spoke and you knew that what you gave will automatically fit in through eternity father may you be merciful to this church and may you be merciful to each one of our life that we remember that wherever we going we are nazarite we are part of the brother we are part of this woman we become king's woman lord father part of this broad to reflect the crust in our character in our way in our talking in everything that we do so that people can
