[0:10] did minister the things which are now
[0:13] reported unto you by them that have
[0:16] preached the gospel unto you with the
[0:19] what holy ghost that sent down from

[0:41] take away their salvation we're just
[0:43] bringing you into oh by god in a hidden
[0:46] veil god hid it from them for us is that
[0:50] right in this hour here now the things
[0:52] that they desire to say but god said no
[0:56] no no no no no like what was this the
[0:58] two sons that wanted to sit on the
[1:01] throne he said it was not i'm not mine
[1:03] to give to you why because they couldn't
[1:06] sit on the left they couldn't sit on the
[1:08] right is that right why because i have
[1:11] to sit on the right and my wife got to
[1:13] sit on the left because it's for his
[1:15] bride is that right that's what those
[1:18] seats are for it's for his bride of
[1:20] jesus christ can we be sitting in the
[1:23] throne
[1:29] he said now look
[1:31] hallelujah
[1:33] which girl of thy loins of your mind
[1:35] sober and hope to end of the grace that
[1:37] is to be brought unto you at the
[1:39] revelation of who
[1:42] yeah when when is a man born again
[1:45] when the revelation of jesus christ
[1:47] comes to them
[1:49] that's where that man is born again is
[1:51] that right when you've seen jesus christ
[1:54] as that was the first door on the east
[1:56] side of the tabernacle is that right huh
[1:59] he is the door he is
[2:02] i am the way i am the truth i am the
[2:05] life is that right his now knows the
[2:08] word being unveiled in this hour here
[2:10] now
[2:11] hallelujah let me keep keep going i'm
[2:13] gonna try to get
[2:15] as much as i can here help me lord he
[2:17] says now
[2:18] he says in those days
[2:21] he dropped down here help me so he says
[2:23] but now the cunningness of the devil
[2:26] makes the people believe that they are
[2:28] christians
[2:31] when they're not
[2:36] let it sink in
[2:37] see
[2:38] that's what the holy spirit was trying
[2:39] to tell us sunday morning
[2:41] huh that's exactly right that's all he's
[2:43] saying people think that they are now
[2:46] god by his grace
[2:48] is bringing you going to bring you
[2:51] up to where you supposed to be by his
[2:54] grace and his mercy
[2:57] he said now look
[2:58] he said it's a cunning day
[3:01] that it would be
[3:02] then when you had to seal your life he
[3:06] said with the testimony the devil has
[3:08] set every cunning trap
[3:11] that he can
[3:15] that's right without
[3:17] every track
[3:19] he's studying he's watching you got to
[3:21] understand his tactics
[3:23] so you got to recognize who you are in
[3:26] his hour here now and followed away in
[3:29] the orders of the lord
[3:31] now you know you are kings and priests
[3:34] is that right so you pray you read your
[3:36] bible you study you study the message
[3:40] help me lord he said now look
[3:43] and jesus told us in matthew 24 how that
[3:46] this would be the living in the living
[3:49] the most deceitful day there is
[3:52] he says so close it be so close that it
[3:56] would deceive the very elect if it were
[3:59] possible is that right
[4:01] remember the holy ghost went to second
[4:03] kings there's sunday is that right he
[4:06] with the second kings and he had elijah
[4:09] and elisha then elijah and elisha he had
[4:12] the son of the son of the prophet is
[4:14] that right and you had the prophet that
[4:17] was there and he got around there they
[4:18] got the word that elijah was about to
[4:21] take off is that right but it was out
[4:23] there somebody listen he wasn't just
[4:26] watching them watching the man is that
[4:28] right the lizard was watching the spirit
[4:30] that was on the man huh you got to
[4:33] understand the anointing that's on the
[4:35] vessel that god is trying to use and
[4:37] speak to you so when they wondered what
[4:39] now elijah knew that that elisha elisha
[4:43] knew that elijah was about to leave but
[4:45] the sons of the prophet they stood way
[4:47] off is that right see there's two
[4:50] spirits it's going to be so close it's
[4:52] going to deceive the very elect if it
[4:54] was possible but they was watching the
[4:57] spirit the anointing when you come in
[4:59] here you prayed up when he was here
[5:01] sharing with us that's why he said when
[5:04] i was a child i act like a child i spoke
[5:06] like a child i did childish things is
[5:08] that right but when i grown up who do
[5:11] what now i put those away now what he
[5:14] come when he was saying that was
[5:15] immature
[5:17] we wasn't ready yet we were still
[5:19] children that's what brother branham
[5:21] talked about in those gifts those ones
[5:23] that was in there remember he was saying
[5:25] about billy paul i think uh uh the
[5:27] pastor read that quote when he ran by
[5:29] billy paul about walking see you can't
[5:32] tell somebody something one time and
[5:33] think they're gonna um just receive it
[5:35] is that right huh he told billy paul he
[5:38] got around there you walk you fall you
[5:40] walk you know how mom and dad trying to
[5:42] teach somebody to walk and the baby
[5:44] falls they get around and the baby falls
[5:46] the next day you come back the next day
[5:49] you're doing it again is that right
[5:51] you're doing it again it's showing him
[5:53] and then eventually do what he started
[5:55] walking he get up and start walking and
[5:58] now they start walking if they do what
[6:00] the baby wants to do they want to run
[6:03] first thing they want to do they want to
[6:05] start running right but now what you got
[6:07] to do now
[6:09] you got to send the pasta
[6:12] to teach them
[6:15] not to run yet you're not ready to run
[6:18] yet though you see
[6:21] so now you come
[6:23] we show them about the gifts that's why
[6:25] the prophet of god said come early
[6:28] put them in the cup prayed up
[6:31] get ready and then god didn't see what
[6:34] god wanted to speak anything to the
[6:36] church
[6:37] he sent him to teach us is that right
[6:40] train up a child and the way he should
[6:42] go when he grow old he won't depart from
[6:45] it
[6:48] hallelujah
[6:50] he said now look
[6:51] he said now he says now
[6:54] let's look at these scriptures
[6:57] he said in second timothy 3 let's look
[6:59] at ii timothy 3
[7:01] then you'll see
[7:03] i think we read these scriptures here
[7:05] last time but we want you by the grace
[7:07] of god
[7:08] to look at them
[7:10] they come the wrong way
[7:15] help me lord and then
[7:17] they're not just
[7:19] let's look at verse one second timothy
[7:22] three and one he said now look
[7:25] he says ii timothy we learned this that
[7:27] the prophet said that it would come
[7:30] to pass in this last days that men would
[7:33] be heady
[7:38] henry is reckless
[7:40] they're
[7:42] thoughtless you know we used to tell
[7:44] people when we were out there on the
[7:46] streets
[7:47] you know you know with
[7:49] one guy you never mess with
[7:53] a guy that can't go home
[7:55] and put his feet up under the table
[7:58] you don't mess with him
[8:01] and a guy that
[8:02] can't even do wrong right
[8:05] you don't mess with him
[8:08] that means he just do things without
[8:10] thinking
[8:13] he can get you killed and somebody else
[8:15] do
[8:17] i don't know what that's for is for
[8:18] somebody
[8:20] he's thoughtless
[8:22] he said he
[8:23] he he said love is a pleasure he said
[8:25] more than lovers of god
[8:27] he said compare that now just for a
[8:30] moment we just brief it he said because
[8:32] we haven't eternally had much time he
[8:34] said but we're just going to highlight
[8:35] it we can see you get home and you study
[8:38] these things he's had it high minded
[8:40] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[8:42] god what the truth breakers false
[8:45] accusers incontinent despisers of those
[8:48] that good see some people are
[8:50] high-minded high-minded doesn't mean
[8:52] that they like smoke their smokers like
[8:54] a fire with just smoke
[8:57] that's all it is they're always running
[8:59] there to do something but they ain't got
[9:00] no fire ain't got no anointing going to
[9:02] them to go do something you see what i'm
[9:04] saying no fire there so god is trying to
[9:07] do he's trying to show him these kind of
[9:10] spirits you're dealing with but remember
[9:12] these aren't any kind of spirits paul
[9:14] was talking about these are religious
[9:17] demons
[9:20] these are religious demons they're
[9:21] sitting up in the churches
[9:23] [Music]
[9:26] brother brown just picked it up and he
[9:28] ran a little bit with it he said now
[9:30] look
[9:31] he said like fire
[9:33] a wicked person incontinent a person
[9:36] that's incontinent i won't get a chance
[9:38] to read all those but that's
[9:39] self-control
[9:40] now you need the holy ghost to come in
[9:42] and bring you under control
[9:44] that's what the pastor was saying then
[9:46] you're not going to kill the fire you
[9:48] don't kill the fire you don't beat it
[9:51] down what you do is is learn them bring
[9:54] them up brother branham says the first
[9:56] thing like the holy spirit is doing
[9:58] first thing he said give him the holy
[10:00] ghost he said you getting the holy ghost
[10:03] he said then you can work with someone
[10:05] after that this is the age for that is
[10:07] that right hallelujah
[10:10] he said now look
[10:12] he said that now the spirit spoke
[10:14] expressly of these things in the later
[10:16] days
[10:17] that's that that's these days
[10:20] the prophecy speaking to it
[10:23] he said lay of the sins and now you
[10:24] remember lay of the sea i just quote
[10:26] some of them lay of the seer age
[10:29] revelations 3 14 is that right
[10:32] you tell them let's turn in and we'll
[10:35] look at it
[10:36] we're still working with deceit
[10:39] the revelation of the word i mean
[10:41] rejecting the revealed word by deceit
[10:45] look at revelations 3 14
[10:48] he said in the angel of the church
[10:50] laodicea writes these things saith the
[10:52] amen and the faithful when the true
[10:54] witness begin he said i know thy works
[10:57] that thou art neither cold nor without a
[11:01] cold or hot i would that that would be
[11:04] cold or hot he said but i but the works
[11:07] that thou needed
[11:09] he said i know thy works that thou need
[11:11] to call her heart i would that that
[11:13] would be cold or hot so then because
[11:15] thou art lukewarm and neither cold or
[11:18] hot i would what spewed thee out of my
[11:20] mouth
[11:22] see that means he had nothing to do with
[11:24] him
[11:25] they put a god out also is that right
[11:28] they spill their mouth because behold
[11:30] that's the only age that's that god they
[11:33] put god outside of the church behold i'm
[11:37] on the outside knocking trying to get in
[11:40] i'm telling you now look he says because
[11:42] thou sayeth that i am rich
[11:44] increase with goods
[11:46] and have need of nothing and knowest and
[11:49] knoweth not that thou are what wretched
[11:52] and miserable and poor and blind and
[11:54] naked and now they're being deceived
[11:57] things
[11:59] let it sink in they don't even know it's
[12:01] deception it's coming in
[12:05] so when you come in here and it's messy
[12:07] now
[12:08] that's why the holy spirit when someone
[12:10] send the pastor that quote he says don't
[12:12] rush him
[12:14] he's got to get this out time is short
[12:18] you're going to need all this to be meet
[12:21] in the storehouse you're going to need
[12:23] it saints god don't unfold something
[12:25] just to be giving it to you
[12:27] no no no you don't put on no show for no
[12:30] one
[12:31] he said now you look
[12:33] he says because thou thou says i am rich
[12:36] if christ was good he said but i was i
[12:38] counseled it to be gold to be tried in
[12:40] the fire that thou may be rich
[12:43] and white raymond but i wanted to the
[12:45] point i wanted you to see was they are
[12:47] being deceived
[12:50] we got to understand this is a great
[12:51] deceitful age that's why i said earlier
[12:55] it's not the sinner the drunker
[12:58] the alcoholic
[13:00] the murderer the robber
[13:02] the thief
[13:03] he know where he's going he or she know
[13:06] where they're going
[13:08] but it's the one that's being deceived
[13:10] by the churches
[13:12] that being deceived by their religion
[13:15] that's why you have to understand he
[13:17] brought the religion to eve from the
[13:20] beginning and it runs all the way up
[13:22] until the end that's always been satan
[13:25] tactic is that right he wanted always to
[13:28] be worshiped he wanted to sit in the
[13:30] seat of god you can go to lucca i mean
[13:33] uh isaiah 14 and he talks about that let
[13:37] me get in there lucifer he always wanted
[13:40] to be worshiped if they're not getting
[13:42] you to jesus christ then you be careful
[13:45] you watch them because christ in his age
[13:48] here now he said if i if i be lifted up
[13:52] from the earth then i'll draw all men
[13:54] unto me is that right hallelujah
[13:58] bringing you into what until the inner
[14:00] court is that right
[14:02] my my my my my when you really can
[14:05] really catch that revelation of the
[14:08] inner court you got to get ready for a
[14:10] real fight saints because when them
[14:12] prayers go up you'll be shaking satan
[14:14] kingdom up is that right he's going to
[14:17] lie to you and make you think there's
[14:19] nothing happened but he said god said
[14:22] what what you're buying on earth they're
[14:24] buying in heaven that means whatever you
[14:26] buying on earth you got all heaven back
[14:30] in you you don't have to fear anything
[14:33] is that right oh death where's thy sting
[14:36] oh grave where is thy victory glory be
[14:39] to god oh heaven is behind you saints
[14:43] here's the power the greatest weapon god
[14:45] given us is power is that right he told
[14:48] them when he got there matthew 10 he
[14:51] send them out i heard the pastor make a
[14:53] quote about that he sent them out they
[14:56] was casting out devils healing the
[14:58] shaking raising the dead doing
[15:00] miraculous work is that right it didn't
[15:03] even have the holy ghost didn't even
[15:06] have the holy ghost why did he say in
[15:08] there now he said go pray that with this
[15:11] he said the laborers are plenty but the
[15:14] harvest is plenty but the laborers are
[15:17] free he said but pray ye that you send
[15:20] what choose the harvest to the what
[15:22] brother to the harvest is that right
[15:25] send us to out there and then what the
[15:28] brother branham say the harvest was he
[15:30] said now you are the harvest let's turn
[15:32] to that scripture i don't want to mess
[15:34] it up let's turn it because it's
[15:36] powerful when the lord showed you that
[15:39] note that when god moved that altar of
[15:42] incense
[15:44] into the inner veil we're trying to show
[15:47] you how powerful your prayers are
[15:53] don't let it say lie to you that's what
[15:56] he do it's rough sometimes i know it'll
[15:58] be rough sometimes but if you get there
[16:00] and say lord god i had a rough day lord
[16:04] jesus but i know lord god you always met
[16:08] me in the inner room is that right he
[16:10] didn't know what right it was he thought
[16:12] he had us he thought he had us drinking
[16:15] he thought he had us in smoking he
[16:17] thought he had us in drugging he thought
[16:20] he had us in mogan he thought he had us
[16:22] in gambling he thought he had us in
[16:24] stealing but it was the name written on
[16:27] that radar the name of when he got into
[16:31] the inner court and my child started
[16:34] blasting them
[16:35] run and to a son and daughter of the
[16:38] most high god
[16:41] you as a branch off of the tree of life
[16:44] is that right you is the brains that
[16:47] come up in the tree of life now you're
[16:49] able to speak life for someone else
[16:55] he'll strengthen that inner land
[16:57] he'll strengthen that inner man ain't
[16:59] that what he says about him when
[17:02] understanding come hallelujah
[17:07] understand
[17:09] understanding
[17:10] when it comes when he's really there
[17:13] it'll be a performance
[17:15] it'll be a performance there hallelujah

[17:38] matthew
[17:39] look at matthew 9 i'll tell you nine
[17:42] at the end
[17:44] verse 37 look at the compassion
[17:48] christ had
[17:50] for those souls that's out there
[17:53] when you're praying
[17:56] ezekiel has his name david
[17:58] ezekiel ezekiel
[18:01] yeah i've been praying for a miracle

[18:05] a miracle's not too hard for our god
[18:08] america
[18:10] that's what we're praying for
[18:12] huh those names when they come to you
[18:15] israel is becoming more and more real to
[18:17] me saints
[18:18] he said look
[18:20] but
[18:21] verse 36
[18:23] matthew 9 36
[18:25] he says but when he saw the multitude he
[18:27] was moved with compassion on them
[18:29] because they fainted and
[18:32] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[18:34] having no shepherds he said then save he
[18:36] unto his disciples the harvest truly is
[18:39] plenteous but the laborers are few
[18:41] he says pray ye therefore the lord of
[18:44] what harvest that he will send forth who
[18:48] laborers into his harvest
[18:52] he was telling you me pray
[18:59] brother brother was saying there in that
[19:01] scripture he says now they know the lord
[19:03] of harvest was standing there
[19:05] he was standing right there so what was
[19:07] he really telling them he was telling
[19:09] you to pray me to pray

[20:59] but i want this to get rooted and
[21:02] grounded so you can god help me so so
[21:05] you can see
[21:06] why the lord is bringing us to that uh
[21:09] tabernacle he says ii thessalonians

[21:16] now
[21:18] chapter 2 chapter 2 verse 1. he says now
[21:21] we receive you brethren by the coming of
[21:23] the lord jesus christ and by our
[21:25] gathering together unto him see unto him

[21:46] he said and then it would be to or be
[21:49] troubled neither by what
[21:51] he's going to try to pressure you in
[21:53] your spirit

[22:59] there are many mansions is that right if
[23:02] it was not so i would not have told you
[23:04] so so all he said he's preparing you and
[23:08] me to meet him is that right
[23:10] but look why they're falling away if god

[24:51] to believe the hour has come for falling
[24:54] away of the church the hour has come
[24:57] that religion would spread the world
[25:01] without salvation

[25:10] people in the system we're against the
[25:13] doctrine that's why i'm saying you have
[25:15] to understand satan's tactics

[25:51] and you got the goods that can help them
[25:54] around the one that's hungry and thirsty
[25:56] for a true god ain't that right we have
[25:59] a testimony that man that's true in
[26:01] testimony uh that brother robert and his
[26:04] wife when those um mattresses flew off
[26:07] of there when they flew off of their
[26:09] truck
[26:10] and that man came by and picked up those
[26:13] mattresses do you know the odds of you
[26:15] getting those mattresses back in a
[26:18] situation like that in this day and time
[26:21] the most deceitful evil wickedest time
[26:24] there it is but god
[26:26] had a ram in the bush is that right
[26:31] he said that man there that man is there
[26:34] perhaps he's a baptist a methodist
[26:37] lutheran whatever but he truly believes
[26:40] he's a christian
[26:42] and that brother prayed but now why
[26:45] brother robert he will make it in sister
[26:48] the realm because he helped god's
[26:51] elected children
[26:54] maybe he's being deceived and he won't
[26:56] come out of that church but god brought
[26:59] forth a situation so he can make it
[27:10] oh
[27:12] he's just seeing grace we just seen
[27:15] grace wait until you finish pulling
[27:17] those bullets hey

[27:27] pastor this you don't need to tell the
[27:28] pastor that let me tell you something
[27:30] the pastor of the age is the prophet of
[27:33] god
[27:34] the pastor of the local assembly he can
[27:37] get grace that none of us can't get uh
[27:45] i'll say it slow
[27:46] he can get grace
[27:49] in areas that we can't
[27:55] let it sink in
[27:56] he's just starting with grace
[27:59] with the uh naomi huh huh look at the
[28:03] grace that was extended to the bride of
[28:06] ruth huh huh
[28:08] look at the condition she was in didn't

[28:28] help me lord
[28:29] he said now look where are we at he said
[28:32] look
[28:33] hallelujah look what he said here
[28:36] thank you jesus
[28:38] he says now
[28:39] the hour has come
[28:41] that religion was spread
[28:43] the the world without salvation he's
[28:46] saying what that's why brother brandon
[28:48] was talking about ii timothy 3 he says
[28:51] they had the what they had the form of
[28:54] godliness
[28:56] denying the holy ghost denying the power
[28:59] thereof
[29:00] that's why he's saying you got people
[29:02] that's coming in here the holy ghost was
[29:05] hitting it you got people that got
[29:06] racist demons is that right they're
[29:09] still struggling with it brother branham
[29:11] had to go to an afro-american church to
[29:13] get the holy ghost didn't he to see that
[29:15] real spirit is that right to see that
[29:18] real anointing on him is that right god
[29:20] is not the con god is not concerned
[29:22] about a specific race
[29:25] god is concerned about the human race
[29:27] that's what he's looking for each and
[29:29] every so when you stand in the gap you
[29:31] stand in the gap for those that god
[29:34] bring unto you those that you see out
[29:37] there struggling and that's why he said
[29:39] he got the holy ghost i don't want to
[29:40] get ahead of myself don't tell me you
[29:42] can't live no holy life he gained adam
[29:45] and eve could live that holy life didn't
[29:47] it he said they had a veil over there
[29:49] but steve brother branham said they had
[29:50] a veil over their eyes and he said they
[29:52] looked at one another and they walked
[29:54] around in their birthday suit
[29:56] huh every day they walked around in
[29:59] their birthday suit that and never
[30:01] desired any sex is that right you got to
[30:04] be careful what you take in the eyes is
[30:07] the gateway to the soul you're only
[30:09] struggling with something because you
[30:11] didn't put the word before you first is
[30:13] that right don't tell me you can't live
[30:15] this life there's no excuse for this
[30:18] generation is that right there's going
[30:20] to be no excuse why because god is
[30:23] unfolding the word that's why he
[30:25] unfolded the seventh seal is that right
[30:28] when he unfolded the seven seals even
[30:30] when he went it will be gold but he even
[30:32] showed his grace in type matthew 24 with
[30:36] what the sixth seal was that right he
[30:38] was talking about the destruction the
[30:41] thing that was going to come after the
[30:43] rapture after we leave here

[31:32] one way to be saved and that's through
[31:34] jesus christ the son of god being born

[38:02] business
[38:03] is that right huh
[38:05] huh
[38:07] maybe you're doing it maybe you're
[38:08] walking the salt a certain way huh
[38:11] you got to know what's going on these
[38:12] guys sit back there and they lined up
[38:15] against us some of you were in high
[38:16] school they lined up against the wall
[38:18] and
[38:19] and they lay bets who they couldn't try
[38:21] to get is that right
[38:25] i don't know that's good it's for
[38:26] somebody you know what help me lord he
[38:29] said now look she was very sexy like
[38:31] this modern girl of today it proved that
[38:35] after her husband was dead she dressed
[38:38] she dressed herself twisted before
[38:40] though she could vamp that man of god
[38:43] see
[38:44] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[38:48] to be fair
[38:49] see
[38:50] his beauty in this end time this beauty
[38:53] that they're trying to catch you with
[38:54] that's why you hear the pastor always
[38:56] talking about facebook facebook all you
[38:59] see is their face
[39:01] isn't that right they're pretty up their
[39:03] face is that right

[39:06] he said now you look
[39:08] he says to throw her out of the window
[39:10] he said now look he said but it proved
[39:14] that her husband was dead she dressed
[39:16] herself and twisted
[39:17] out before the jewel he said though she
[39:20] conveyed that man of god but she said he
[39:24] already said throw her out of the window
[39:27] we have more men like jewett today think
[39:31] if you have more pastors like us here
[39:33] today that's not
[39:35] shooting blanks is that right he's not
[39:39] shooting blanks uh he's shooting
[39:41] straight at the target and most of the
[39:43] time he doesn't know the holy ghost just
[39:45] move him in and out is that right
[39:47] because you know every man know the
[39:50] bitterness and the wickedness of their
[39:52] hearts is that right but the word of god
[39:54] is sharper than any two-edged sword as
[39:57] able to discern and thought the intents
[39:59] of every heart is that right you ought
[40:01] to thank god for the word of god the
[40:04] intense you're intense he's sending you
[40:06] a word to block that foolishness so that
[40:09] you won't move in and get yourself into
[40:11] a jam is that right
[40:14] hallelujah he said as jewish today we
[40:17] have it says we we have less judgment
[40:21] then we'll have less jezebels he said
[40:24] but that was that was her nature
[40:26] and she was a worshiper of idols anyway
[40:30] she brought the whole nation to idolatry
[40:34] huh the whole world is in idolatry but
[40:39] they're bringing them to idolatry
[40:41] through religion that's what he's
[40:43] bringing them in sorcery with the
[40:46] witchcraft is that right he's bringing
[40:49] them through religion let me keep going
[40:52] help me lord he said and so has our
[40:55] modern trend today
[40:57] now you wonder why say you don't need
[40:59] this oh yes you do need this you're
[41:01] going to find out down the road you're
[41:03] going to need this saints you're going
[41:05] to need more and more of god in this
[41:08] hour here now because this wickedness
[41:11] religious demon it'll come so close it
[41:14] will deceive the very last if it was
[41:16] possible but it can't see he got in the
[41:19] land you got to understand if you got in
[41:22] there joshua they deceived him
[41:25] temporarily and they got in the land he

[41:32] of god and his righteousness and
[41:35] everything else to be added unto you you
[41:37] teach your children about praying you

[41:42] the miraculous move of our miraculous
[41:45] god in his hour here now and is that
[41:47] right but when he came in there he did
[41:50] joshua said what a can he still have
[41:53] garments hidden in his heart is that
[41:55] right they ain't carrying it now not
[41:57] only they can't suffer but he got there
[42:00] in his whole family got killed also is
[42:02] that right but look at the grace that's
[42:05] being extended to us oh you may have
[42:07] snatched a hole a bride maybe you
[42:10] snatched a hole a son of god maybe you
[42:13] snatched a hole of a daughter of god
[42:16] then you slipped in like the holy ghost
[42:18] said but look at the grace that it
[42:20] extended to you because the unbelieving
[42:23] husband could stand in the gap with an

[42:30] unbelievable the non-believing husband

[44:35] with the worldly spirit

[44:42] want to bring christ to them
[44:44] is that right we're looking at them god
[44:46] has given you the holy ghost he's veiled
[44:49] you the holy ghost inside it i said lord
[44:51] i look at those even the ones standing

[45:04] understand god have mercy when i look at
[45:07] him i say god have mercy on them lord
[45:09] that's a terrible thing a mind that the
[45:12] devil is just tormenting and tormenting
[45:14] but god who's rich in mercy is able to
[45:18] use one of you to stand in the gap for

[45:35] the lord for them don't waste your time
[45:37] about worldly conversations that's what
[45:40] the holy spirit was saying the worst
[45:43] thing idolatry is idle time and because
[45:46] if you say things wrong satan is just
[45:49] waiting paul said the things that i did
[45:52] i decided the things i desired to do i
[45:54] did not the things i desire not to do i
[45:57] did so you got to understand wherever
[46:00] good is evil is always present satan is
[46:04] just waiting that's all for you to come
[46:06] out of your mouth with something wrong
[46:08] is that right vain babbling leads to
[46:11] nothing is that right your words is the
[46:14] words of life
[46:16] let me keep going
[46:18] you're producing the words of life
[46:19] that's coming from us look what he says
[46:22] he says now look
[46:24] the greatest iniquity
[46:27] oh boy he said
[46:30] he said god he said god blessing us
[46:32] because
[46:34] he said god just give me a few more
[46:35] minutes pray with me he says god
[46:38] blessing us
[46:39] because he's prosperous us
[46:43] he says that's the he says now that's no
[46:46] sign because blessings not all at all
[46:49] but what i'm saying is
[46:51] some people that's being deceived into
[46:54] the systems by the religious systems
[46:58] they are being taught prosperity is a
[47:01] vessel and spiritual blessing you see
[47:04] through deceit against things remember
[47:07] what our what our topic was rejecting
[47:10] the revealed word by deceit

[1:01:15] hallelujah
[1:01:19] hallelujah
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:23] this deception
[1:01:26] if you study the message
[1:01:29] you will really really be on your toes
[1:01:33] and you're going to be even careful with
[1:01:35] your cell phone
[1:01:37] and very very careful more so with your
[1:01:40] computer and everything else
[1:01:42] brother bradham say you might not be a
[1:01:44] prostitute on the street
[1:01:46] but you can be a prostitute on a higher
[1:01:49] level if you need the court you see me
[1:01:51] brother branham say you can be that kind
[1:01:54] of a prostitute by prostituting your
[1:01:56] time
[1:01:58] amen
[1:01:59] so you see what we're doing
[1:02:01] in the eyes of god you can be as pure as
[1:02:04] a lily but in the eyes of god look at
[1:02:06] what you're doing amen
[1:02:08] this deception is so great so great
[1:02:13] the bible says in the book of revelation
[1:02:15] that because i'm rich because i'm this
[1:02:17] because i'm this need of nothing those
[1:02:20] people are not saying just rich like
[1:02:22] that
[1:02:23] it's a church
[1:02:25] that is speaking
[1:02:27] it is not the people of the world
[1:02:30] have you ever thought that
[1:02:31] no it's a church that is speaking it is
[1:02:34] not sinners that are saying that they
[1:02:36] are rich
[1:02:38] no it's church people
[1:02:41] that have caught
[1:02:42] another understanding
[1:02:45] that
[1:02:46] prosperity means that god is with them
[1:02:51] that's why they don't need anything
[1:02:54] because the tendency is
[1:02:56] when you look at god as somebody that
[1:02:59] you do something wrong you get a
[1:03:00] whooping
[1:03:01] so if god if you didn't get a whooping
[1:03:04] so what i'm doing is right
[1:03:07] you understand god wrong
[1:03:09] that's why people do things that are
[1:03:11] wrong and nothing happened to them and
[1:03:14] they say well if nothing didn't happen
[1:03:16] to me so why is why are you telling me
[1:03:18] it's wrong because the lord doesn't want
[1:03:20] me
[1:03:21] you will go to hell peacefully
[1:03:24] and find yourself in hell
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:27] so that those people that were saying
[1:03:29] because i'm rich because i'm this i'm
[1:03:31] this i'm this that's why brother branham
[1:03:33] said the pressure of the age
[1:03:35] is what is riches
[1:03:38] we handle this stuff in question and
[1:03:40] answer and the majority of the church is
[1:03:42] not even there amen and the people that
[1:03:46] struggle the more if you sit with me
[1:03:48] and you see where we are pulling people
[1:03:51] from their lives
[1:03:53] you will be afraid
[1:03:56] amen i was talking to somebody today if
[1:03:58] you put your hand you're pulling
[1:04:00] somebody you just open up you see a mess
[1:04:03] and a mess and a mess and a mess and
[1:04:05] they were a message believer
[1:04:09] and mess after mess after mess after
[1:04:11] mess and then we got to sit and then
[1:04:12] clean that all up i said brother if this
[1:04:15] happened you don't want to be stay for
[1:04:17] the rapture
[1:04:18] like this amen it's people that have
[1:04:21] that mentality it's coming from a
[1:04:23] pentecostal world they think because
[1:04:26] prosperity means god is with you and
[1:04:28] before you know it they turn into money
[1:04:32] minded people
[1:04:34] all the time money money money money and
[1:04:36] the church means nothing
[1:04:38] if money is on the left and the church
[1:04:41] is here they will go to money and
[1:04:44] just leave the church when they say
[1:04:46] lovers of pressure do you know what it
[1:04:48] means lovers of pleasure do you know
[1:04:50] what it means
[1:04:51] it means the church is up and there is a
[1:04:53] game you go into the game
[1:04:55] it means there is a wonderful fellowship
[1:04:57] you're going to meet with your friend
[1:04:59] over there and you're going to leave

[1:08:51] you don't pray
[1:08:52] you don't go to church as you're
[1:08:54] supposed to go you don't read the bible
[1:08:57] like you're supposed to go it says been
[1:08:59] two years you never sat down and
[1:09:01] listened to a message you never sat down
[1:09:04] and read the whole sermon book
[1:09:07] all you do is you're on netflix
[1:09:10] what do you think you're doing
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:14] that's why your conscience become dead
[1:09:18] back here and now what we're doing we're
[1:09:20] hammering and then the man is now
[1:09:22] working or all the the the sister
[1:09:24] doesn't catch because there has been
[1:09:26] dough
[1:09:27] in their conscience they can't get it
[1:09:30] because you stay in that uh uh a state
[1:09:34] for so long
[1:09:36] until it's common it's normal it's an
[1:09:39] ego that was up there that landed down
[1:09:42] and now he's sitting listening to the
[1:09:44] child each other each other shot each
[1:09:46] other until a prophet have to use a gun
[1:09:53] do you hear me that eagle was staying
[1:09:55] there watching the squirrel
[1:09:58] anybody here
[1:09:59] what took that eagle away was when
[1:10:02] brother branham took the shotgun when
[1:10:04] the prophet took the word
[1:10:07] and aim it to the ego he helped the ego
[1:10:11] to leave that
[1:10:14] that shot each other and go out brother
[1:10:16] branham was not trying to kill the ego
[1:10:19] he was trying to scare him to pull him
[1:10:21] back to his position
[1:10:23] so when you read brother branham it's a
[1:10:25] message you're not reading a story he's
[1:10:28] telling you something in between that
[1:10:30] story don't read the message like
[1:10:32] stories it's not stories
[1:10:34] it's showing you brother branham is the
[1:10:35] messenger he came and he's holding a
[1:10:38] shotgun and he's talking to amigo and he
[1:10:41] realized that the eagle is not supposed
[1:10:43] to be done here he's supposed to be
[1:10:45] there he pulled the shotgun the shotgun
[1:10:48] on the prophet moved the eagle back to
[1:10:50] position
[1:10:51] hallelujah
[1:10:53] amen
[1:10:55] here that's why we use shotgun
[1:10:58] to pull you back again where you
[1:11:00] supposed to go how can you sit with a
[1:11:02] friend that tells story all the time
[1:11:08] and you're comfortable and you love them
[1:11:10] no there is something in you
[1:11:13] that is craving for that foolishness
[1:11:18] anybody care because if the holy ghost
[1:11:20] come
[1:11:22] that friend have two options
[1:11:24] either they're gonna correct themselves
[1:11:26] and change or they're gonna leave you
[1:11:27] amen and it's better for them to leave
[1:11:29] you because every day that you're
[1:11:32] sitting with a friend for five years
[1:11:34] there is no progression and you sticking
[1:11:37] with that friend
[1:11:40] and matter of fact when you leave that
[1:11:41] friend you have to repent all the time
[1:11:44] because you were talking about somebody
[1:11:46] else you were talking about somebody
[1:11:47] else you were talking about somebody
[1:11:49] else you were talking about hey push the
[1:11:50] brake and say wait a minute every time i

[1:12:17] don't be deceived
[1:12:19] amen realize where you are
[1:12:23] the hardest shell i'm bidding now it's
[1:12:26] the religious shell that is making you
[1:12:29] think i have the holy ghost i have the
[1:12:32] holy ghost i have the yes yes i
[1:12:34] understand what he's saying but i don't
[1:12:36] think if i stood for this message that
[1:12:38] means i have the holy ghost

[1:12:45] it was only one that left judah
[1:12:49] did they have the holy ghost

[1:12:58] he saw the angel of the lord
[1:13:00] he didn't have the holy ghost which
[1:13:02] state was cornelius
[1:13:06] you see
[1:13:07] and he was doing good giving arms to the
[1:13:10] people and praying god continually until
[1:13:13] the angel of the lord came by no holy
[1:13:15] ghost you see where it's deadly
[1:13:18] and god have to send peter
[1:13:21] to take cornelius into the holy of
[1:13:23] holies
[1:13:27] and then from there on nobody talk about
[1:13:29] cornelius in the bible anymore in other
[1:13:31] words it is finished
[1:13:33] job is done let him for the rest of his
[1:13:36] life everybody
