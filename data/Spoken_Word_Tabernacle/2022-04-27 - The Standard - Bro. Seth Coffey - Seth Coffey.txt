needs to stay ready [Laughter] amen wow jesus who makes the darkness tremble do you believe that i can tell you a story if you don't believe it if you have a hard time believing that i can tell you a story the devil troubled me so much for couple days on tuesday morning my phone locked can't make phone calls can't receive no text so if you text me i cannot even see anything called the company if i'm not mistaken i spoke to about 14 people so you know where your pastor was what a trial [Laughter] they sent me to this one they send until they send me to some song themself they can't fix it amen then finally i can make phone calls i cannot receive any text so if i text you you will see it if you send me a text i cannot see anything so i was in the dark i'm trying to get in a portal for the bank they say authorization code they're saying that i cannot see anything so i'm locked here i'm lucky i'm locked there i spoke to brother robert and brother can i say brother kelly you pray for me everything i planned was not working accordingly two days do you know when the stuff got resolved as soon as i got in this church [Laughter] brother david send the link i cannot receive the link i said brother say david would you send me the link personally as soon as brother david sent the link i'm looking at my screen all the text messages since tuesday are popping up one by one amen it's jesus who makes the darkness tremble amen now if a cellphone can enter in this church can you give me some more volume if a cellphone can enter in this building and the cell phone gets fixed how much more human beings [Laughter] so if you enter with a problem tonight guarantee your problem should be solved if it's a high blood pressure it must go if it's allergy it must go whatever it is here in the presence of the king he must live because jesus makes the darkness tremble [Applause] oh my god blessed be the name of the lord amen he thought he's troubling me he turns into the glory of god and the deliverance of his people oh my i don't know if he got mad on the new heart or the new spirit i don't know what troubled him [Laughter] i know for sure he doesn't like the clarity on the new birth he wants people to get confused until you don't know what is the holy ghost how to receive it what happened in your new birth he doesn't want it he put all the confusion around this thing for years and years we don't understand brother branham spoke a new heart and the youth spirit by the brand i'm saying you need to have the holy ghost then you need to have the baptism of the holy ghost until you don't know what's going on but today it's a different story amen you're not the only one learning i am learning myself i see thinks that i've never seen before amen now you understand that justification does a lot than just being justified amen being justified means a lot of things he kills the law he stopped the law he changed the priesthood for you he even changed the law from the law of moses to the law of jesus christ that's why you cannot be in the field of boaz trembling amen amen oh my i keep that for sunday [Laughter] blessed be the name of the lord god richly bless you and appreciate everybody here tonight and we have uh brother set coffee preaching for us tonight if you don't remember him when brother tim cross was here lately there was a minister a young minister who prayed at the end of the service and as soon as he steps here i just love his spirit i could see god is working in his life so his wife is here sister selena and his baby so welcome on spoken word tabernacle amen you are not a stranger we don't have visitor you're just a part of the family so i thought brother said twice i say you preach like home he said can i take my jacket off and say preach like home do everything like home you are home amen so he has already some experience of what's going on here by god's grace everything will be fine and sister bridget it's good to see mama right there god bless you mother good to see you again amen brother believe it's a surgery yeah okay brother mickey will go through a minor surgery i believe there's something on the side that they need to remove this uh friday so you keep him in prayer that everything will be okay so the one who fixed this cell phone here will take care of that surgery [Laughter] amen you don't know what he did to me when i was standing there and suddenly i can see all messages coming up one by one they were coming like in cascade boom boom boom boom you waited only until you get in the presence of god so cell phone can obey the presence of god oh my blessed be the name of the lord so i won't take much time i believe everything is good by god's grace you could remember brother sean martin's meeting that is going on on virginia just remember them in prayer so that the lord give them some good time whoever can make it fine if not we stand with them in prayer and support the meeting in prayer amen so i won't take much time i'm going to call brother set he have his liberty he's a home he's uh one of the local ministers i believe he's with brother josh bennett yes so but he is on fire i love young people on fire amen so brother said you home preach like home only believe only believe only believe [Music] believe thank you [Music] all things amen you know always one thing i love about that song when i think about it is it says only believe because if you only believe it leaves no room for doubt so that's where we are tonight we're just believing that jesus christ i believe i'm around a group of people that believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen i just want to say i'm honored and privileged to be here this evening i thank you for the invitation to come brother stephen you know i must admit when i when i first came here and you know i brother i already feel insufficient enough as it is but and i'm going to tell one on myself it's going to make me look real bad but i don't care but when i got here you know and i was waiting for brother tim to get up and brother stephen gets up man and he's he's wearing that bible out he's got scripture scripture and he's tying it all together and he's putting all these types together and everything and i feel so insufficient watching him doing that one my brother and i'm so nervous i think i built up a complex brother stephen because you know i'm like i'm like brother branham you know i always say you know i don't know the scripture real well but i know the author well brother stephen knows them both and and i was like goodness gracious so when i got you know then brother i was just i guess i built a complex there and i was so nervous you know i don't really know why but i was and i was sitting there going man i you know you just it really humbled me and it really gave me and i'm not just trying to lift him up because he let me preach this is my heart now you don't you don't think none of that that ain't my heart or my goal i'm just telling you the impression that i had of the church when i came and and you know i was so nervous after watching him and you know he's tying all these scripture together and everything else and i can't even find ezekiel in my bible when tim calls for ezekiel and i'm sitting there going i've turned to it a thousand times why can't i find it you know so i was just and then you know just the so at the end of the service i was saying lord i'm so insufficient don't let him ask me to pray lord do not let him ask me to pray and he said brother seth will you come oh man so i start working my way up here and i don't know what i just did but that'll be all for the music by the way but i start working my way up here and i'm nervous and then he says brother seth come pray and then he said something about another brother seth and i say good lord am i even supposed to be the one up here praying i don't know what's going on and about the time i get up here and this is just something else too you know we uh bless his heart our pastor brother josh ain't as tall as brother shango so i got up here behind i'm used to a pulpit about right here and i get up here and you know this thing's up to my chest and i'm like i don't even deserve it i can't even feel this spot and but i'll tell you what as soon as you people started praying with me i felt the spirit of god come down and he just took over and you know i said you know if that's the way these people are gonna pull i would love to speak for them one day will you pull that way again tonight amen we just i won't try to keep you standing i definitely won't hold you along tonight the lord might but i won't but uh we're just here you know very thankful very thankful for my wife selena and and uh you know i believe sister grace came from the home church to sing and different things so we appreciate that you know my wife uh i tell you she you know satan's been bad on this service for this team satan satan has been everybody i talked to has been having problems this that and the other and you know as soon as i tried to go and start you know i prepared some last night and then i was going to prepare some this evening when i got off work and i was coming home and as soon as i closed that door that office i heard babies screaming toys going everywhere and i was going good lord satan knows how to battle but you know she it's always great that you know she she would keep those kids for me so i could come and study and try to prepare and so i just really appreciate her being with me and helping me so if you have your bibles uh i'd like to turn to isaiah 59 19. isaiah 59 19 and brother shango could probably quote that by heart but i love y'all i know i'm i'm i'm a cut up if you if you haven't noticed already and i'm sorry for that but uh we send greetings from brother josh bennett and the different ministers and just looking forward to worshiping the lord with you tonight i make you a promise if you pull i'll preach i'll make you a promise isaiah 59 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun now listen here church when the enemy shall come in like a flood has that not happen i don't even think about that till right now praise god i already feel good when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him hallelujah let's bow our heads heavenly father lord god lord we come before you this evening lord and i'm so thankful lord god that that here this evening lord i am not servant a dead god but i am serving the king of kings and the lord of lords and i'm so glad to know lord that no matter what the enemy does no matter what he says lord god you have rose up your standard against him this evening almighty god the spirit of the lord is here to combat the enemy he cannot overcome this service father because you said i have already overcome the world almighty god lord we have the great victorious one among us lord this evening almighty god lord we're just praying this evening would you walk up and down the aisles of each and every heart lord god deliver the captive lord god lord give joy to them that are depressed lord give peace lord to those that are distressed this seed and almighty god father i believe with all my heart lord god as i've said many times before lord if i could pull back the veil lord this afternoon lord i could see a problem over here lord and there may be something going on in a family over here lord lord i don't know nothing about that almighty god but lord you know everything lord god lord you even said that you know that what we needed before we ever even asked for it god so lord i just pray this evening lord god lord if you need to direct me a different way lord god you just go that way lord you have your way lord i felt so insufficient lord coming here lord and i still do lord god but lord i say this this evening lord i'm tired of lord wondering if i'll preach a good sermon or not almighty god i'm tired of worrying about what the flesh does lord if you want to make me a fool let me be a fool for jesus this evening lord whatever you want to do pull me whichever way you want to almighty god i don't care lord god what happens in this service lord i just ask that you speak to your people deliver your people help your people lord that's the desire of our heart lord we love you we praise you lord take full and complete preeminence of this service lord forgive us of any shortcoming or anything that we might have done lord god that wasn't pleasing to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray you may be seated i'd like to read that again and we'll start so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun i want to read this part when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him i'd like to read a quote here now god cannot make a decision today and tomorrow and come back with a make a better decision tomorrow because his first decision is perfect his first decision is perfect he never has to change it so therefore we can rest upon whatever god says is that right that's the reason that i believe the bible is god's word now the reason i believe that god has to judge the world by some standard now tonight we're going to be preaching on the standard tonight and if and if it's my church which one is it see there's hundreds of them in different churches and organizations and lutherans say we have it and the baptists say no we got in the press the presbyterians say we got it and the pentecost will say no this is it and nazarene say no this is it he said you'd be confused but you see it's the word i just believe it's the word see just take it the way it's wrote and believe it just take it the way it's wrote and believe it and it's of no private interpretation it says it's just written there and there's only one way this is another quote there's only one way that you can ever know that you're right stay with god's eternal blueprint stay with the word what god says that's right don't take nothing less or nothing more why should we have substitutes for this that and the other when god's word is full of promises i want you to know fool what does that mean look here church it's full it's full it's not lacking anything this bottle is full this evening it is full of promises yes sir we don't take any substitutes this is the truth god keeps his word no matter how unreasonable it may seem god keeps his word i can say amen to that church of the living god hey man i better get my get my foundation started here before i get going but i just want to get going matthew 24 35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away so we can so i can say here to you if he's going to raise up a standard what is the standard this evening the standard is the word of god we have a standard here this scene and the other thing about the word of god the word of god is eternal it says heavens and earth will pass away and we know that that brother branham would look at that and he said i always wondered how how it would mean pass away and he said not pass away like a obliteration i believe he said but to change from one form to another but god is saying you know heavens and earth might change but my word will never change the eternal god when the eternal god makes an eternal promise you can hold on to that the problem that people have is they get stuck in this time listen church of god god's promises do not have a time element on them but they are yeah and amen you can grab a hold of any one of them you want and when the enemy comes in like a flood you can grab a hold of the standard and say satan you can't go any further glory to god but you know people are this is this message that i that the lord gave me this evening was actually the message that the lord put on my heart and brother abel can testify this when i was here with brother tim he said something that struck my heart and buddy i just started writing stuff down as fast as i could and you know i was beginning to think of that the standard the standard there's many standards and you know i'm a i myself am a cnc machinist and i'll make this as simple as i can because nobody ever hears about it or knows what it is but i i i have a they give me a part a piece of metal and they give me a print and they say seth we want you to program that machine to cut what's on this print on that part so by the time i get done with this chunk of metal it's going to look like this print right here so that's what i do and you know when i was thinking about that when i got the inspiration you know people are always trying to change the standard people why are denominations failing why are they not have revival why are things down because they put a period on the word of god they're they're not taking the word of god they're saying well you know the bible don't really mean that church of the living god when jesus himself says heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall not change and they're saying oh he doesn't really mean that the word don't really mean that i hope you know the word was made flesh and dwelt among us if you don't like something in this bible you might as well be cutting jesus's arm off brother because the word of god is the standard you know and i was thinking about that that there was once a time a long time ago that there was always this story at work and there was this guy that that he had a gauge to go into a part and the gauge was the standard and he had to modify the part he had to make the part to fit that gauge but you know what he did he took that gauge and he modified it to fit the part and you know he thought he did something great you know he got this part and the gauge wouldn't go in it so he just took the gauge over to the grinder cut off a little bit of here cut a little bit of word off here cut a little bit off there until it fit what he thought was right and he took it to the qc inspector and he said you know the part wouldn't fit but don't worry i ground down the gauge to make it fit and you should have seen the qc inspector's jaw drop you did what i took the gauge and i ground it down and now it fits in that part he said listen there is a great engineer somewhere that knew what he needed and he made that gauge specifically to fit that part in church of the living god he took that gauge he put his own ideas in it he put what he thought it should be and he took that gauge and he tried to stick it in that part and you know it might have fit his ideas but it didn't fit the original engineer's design glory to god satan might say you're sick but jesus said oh he said he's the god that healeth all thy diseases that's the standard that's the gauge oh church of the living god you know what he said you know what the qc inspector said about that part he said that part is dead and there's too many dead churches too many dead christians because they refuse to take the word of god as a standard you'll take your ideas you'll take how you're about where's brother robert adam i'll tell you what when i was back there i said brother robert pray for my shoulder my shoulder was hurting but he prayed for it i took the standard and now my shoulder is feeling pretty good brother rob because that's the standard that's the word of god if you ever got to change it hope this is all right brother if you ever got to change the word of god to fit your standard you need to raise your standard a little bit [Applause] hallelujah numbers 12 25-33 this is the spies going out and when they return from search into the land 40 days and they went and came to moses and into aaron into all the congregation of the children of israel in the wilderness apparent to kadish and brought back word unto them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land just like the blueprint said it would be there and they told him and said we came into the land whether thou sentenced us and surely man that's crazy ain't it what god said was actually there and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of enoch there and the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites listen the amalekites the hittites and the jebusites and the americas dwell in the mountains and the and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan so it looks like they're surrounded on every side by evil in church if i ever could say that there was a time that we are surrounded by evil on every side it's in this layout of sin church age everywhere you look evil little demons big demons giant demons all around us but church you know what what their standard was they began to look at the problems they began to look at their ideas of it but caleb steps up and it said and caleb stealed the people caleb was about sick of their standard caleb stealed the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it caleb said i don't care what your standard is when god spoke through the prophet and when he made a promise and he said we can have that land those those those other spies they were looking at giants they were looking at the enemy they were looking at strongholds they were looking at everything but caleb was looking at the standard caleb was looking at the promise caleb didn't they said you know what they got they said we can't do it and they got wilderness but caleb said i can do it because god said i can and he said give me my mountain is there anybody willing this evening to say give me my mountain listen church this is your promised land right here there's a ton of promises in here there's some it's flown with milk and honey it's flowing with grapes but every devil out of hell is trying to tell you you can't have it you can't obtain it you can't get it but let me tell you something if you want to be like caleb give me my mountain when your shoulder hurts say brother give me my mountain [Music] and let me tell you something tonight when you don't feel like serving the lord give me my mountain raise up in faith and worship god this evening i'm going to tell you something church of the living god if i can say it this way people say you know brother you're just you're just trying to get an amen i'm gonna be honest with you i am trying to get an amen i'm trying to get an amen for the king of kings the lord of lords i'm trying to get an amen for the one that died for you that took away your sin so that you could be here i ain't trying to get no amen for me i want to amen for the standard jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever when the enemy came in like a flood god still had a standard caleb was staying caleb and joshua were standing there and they said this is my land this is my inheritance and that's where you're at this evening every devil out of hell every devil in laodicea is trying to say you can't have it it ain't yours you won't make it oh come on church it's not going to be your land god's promises are eternal it's already your land brother branham said if jesus christ walked in here he could no more heal you because he's already healed you accept your healing can i tell you the standard of mark 16 this evening brother there was a time that i hurt my back i was moving a grill and i hurt my back real bad and for about three years i had back problems and you know brother isaiah sheffield i don't know if any of you know him or not but he was preaching over at tim hayden's and i decided to go over and support him you know on the way there you know the enemy came in like a flood brother oh man i love this now i'm starting to see it everywhere the enemy came in like a flood on the way there and he began to say you know you've had back pain for too long you've had back pain for too long you know if the lord was going to heal you would have already had to do it because now it's really set in and then and you know being in and i say i don't know it's either the devil or you know it could have been my own mind because the carnal mind is an enemy against god and i was sitting there but you know i'm so glad there was something deeper down there and that's so real and it began to say what are you talking about and i began to say you know what god you're absolutely right if you want to heal me today or 20 years from now you can just as easily heal me because that's the standard that's mark 16. lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and i went to that service that night and i was in there and he preached that does that serve that service looking from the right angle let me tell you something i wasn't looking from the right angle at first i was looking at what satan said look at what my cardinal mind said but when i began to look at the standard church when i began to change my focus and i began to look at that standard you know he he kind of said oh he gave he gave this little you know if anybody wants prayed for i'll pray for you and you know me i'm sitting back and i'm going man i should i should get prayed for but i miss my chance i said but god if you'll just have brother tim say something along the lines of somebody getting prayed for i said brother i'll be the first one in the pool i'll be the first one to jump in the pool and he came up and he said you know when atmosphere is like this people can be healed first one in the pool i was gonna get my blessing and he began to pray for me church three years of back pain every day going to sleep laying down waking up in back pain every day chiropractor couldn't fix me things couldn't fix me but glory to god there was one there was a greater there was a standard in the land and he began to lay hands on me and he began to pray and you know what i realized brother stephen i wasn't waiting for god to heal me god had already healed me he was just waiting for me to accept my healing and when i accepted my healing i walked away from that building and i haven't had back pain since because he's the standard the standard still holds there's promises if you've got some family in the land go get them it's your standard it's your promise it's yours confidence in oh brother if you wanted to see someone dancing you should have been in my study when i read this when i started thinking of the standard luke 1 37 for with god some things are possible for with god nothing shall be impossible church of living god is about time we throw down our excuses oh somebody said something i hope this is okay somebody said something about me and you know i don't really know i don't want them to think i'm a hypocrite or something else i just want to say this this this this this evening are you really going to let let someone affect the way that you worship somebody that died for you are you really going to think well somebody across the building might think i'm just a little emotional and i'm not forget about that don't let the devil bring you down don't let the devil take your worship that worship belongs to god and you give it to him he rightly deserves it you know what you deserved and i deserve we deserve to die we deserve to go to hell but through grace and mercy he reached out and saved us so how much more can we worship him glory to god seth coffey good for nothing but he saved me by his grace it don't take much reason to worship jesus you start thinking about jesus you'll find some reason to worship him think about what he's done in your life think about when you were sick and he healed you think about when you were depressed and he gave you joy oh think about when you were distraught and he gave you that peace in your life it don't take much thinking to have a reason to worship jesus hallelujah glory to god hallelujah you show what confidence you have brother branham says you show what confidence you have in your doctor by taking his medicine you don't even know what it is you show your confidence in the doctor by submitting yourself to an operation you know when i was 16 when i was 16 15 16 years old and i had that operation i never knew that man in my life i never seen him before but somebody told me that he was a medical expert and he was great at doing surgery so i put my confidence in him barely knew the man and you know what the funny thing was he didn't guarantee success but i still put my confidence in him and the doctor by submitting yourself to an operation that proves your confidence in the doctor but when it comes to christ you're scared to take him at his word here's a big amen from seth coffey been there before you're scared to take him at his word how is it faith is the victory you could submit your case to jesus christ tonight just submit your case to the doctor give me anything you want to lord you're the doctor on the case then you've got the victory church if we can trust a doctor that we barely know to do a major surgery on us or or give us a pill we don't even know what's in that pill we ain't got a clue i ain't against doctors y'all brother branham plainly taught that but we don't even know what they're giving us but let me tell you something if you took your hand on your left side and you felt that heartbeat right there there was someone greater that gave you that heartbeat there was someone greater through every trial of your life when you thought i don't see how i'm going to make it but you made it i don't see how i can make it through this but he brought you through it but we put more confidence in a doctor than we put in jesus christ that doctor didn't die for you that doctor didn't take stripes for you what jesus christ did and he's saying this evening i'm the standard just look to me don't look to the things of the world look to me glory to god know i started thinking of that can i just can i just give some testimony this evening you know i was thinking of that standard and there's a little there's a little boy back there and you know when he was born they did a test on his ears and they said one of his ears has failed and i would not have it that might have been what the doctor said but that wasn't my standard that wasn't my standard you know what i began to do i began to get out my phone and i began to play that song i speak jesus and i said boy you're going to hear the name of jesus if it's the last thing i do you're going to hear the name of jesus and we kept playing it and playing it and playing it and you know he had to come back later for you know actually he when he was listen they came back and they said we'll come back in an hour and test it again and he failed again i said those are lying vanities let me tell you something god prom this is this is a different testimony but god promised me that boy when i was in the mountains of virginia and i looked up at the sun coming over and i was so distraught i hope this is okay telling with my wife here but but but we went through a miscarriage and i was sitting there going god i don't understand this i don't know i said but god if you could just let me look in the message and let me see something god that would help me i just need it right now and i don't even know what tape it was or where i was but i scrolled through you know randomly scrolled pick one randomly it's called half through and and click play and it said now remember abraham had to wait for the promised son he had to wait for the promised son but it was a promise and i've seen the sun coming up i began to thank god your mercies are new today and i and i knew i was going to have a son because god promised me and as i would we did that early early tests to figure out what it was and i heard my wife upstairs and they said would you like to know what it is and she said yes and she's in the nurse said it's a boy and i begin to say praise god because church this is god's standard and he says in his word and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do if you ask anything in my name i will do it so i said forget what the doctor said the doctor ain't the standard and i prayed and i believed and she went back for the test and he passed with perfect hearing in both ears because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's why i believe this message brother it don't put god in a bag on day it don't put god in the future but he's a god of right now he's my god he's my portion he's my standard glory [Music] hallelujah brother seth i'm sick in my body but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed reach out and claim that promise in the name of jesus christ you ain't got to live with that devil that devil's on your land you ain't on his land he's on your land kill that devil he ain't got no right no church of the living god as caleb would be the standard as he took the word and he was the standard you ain't no church bride you ain't no worldly bride but you are the word bright you are the standard this evening you are the one you are the one that's gonna take a rapture that's your promise [Applause] devil this is seth coffey i'm the one i'm the standard you're the standard the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the bride [Applause] it's time for us to stop living beneath our privileges we are the chosen last day bride of the last age i was hand-picked to take a rapture i was hand-picked to believe this message if god thinks that about me i might as well fulfill it glory to god in the house i'm here to praise him hey look around the enemy came in like a flood but the lord raised up a standard against i got a little i got a little girl back there i think she took her out but i got a little girl back there three years old and she woke up in the middle of the night crying daddy my feet my feet and i went to grab her feet and she had a bump come up on her foot and it was swollen i didn't know what to do in the moment but i began to cry out and i said lord i really need you right now and i began to think of that captain that was on his deathbed and then the boy came up and he said let me tell you how my mama taught me how to read isaiah 53 5 and said he was wounded and you know the name for such and such transgressions so i said god i took it back to the standard church and i said but he was wounded for jolie faith coffee's transgressions he was bruised for jolie faith coffee's iniquities the chastisement of jolie's faith's peace was upon him and with those lovely stripes joe lee faith coffee is healed and buddy the presence of god came down in that room and that girl when i was praying as i was reading that scripture she was continuously getting louder in pain but when i said and by those lovely stripes joe lee faith coffee is healed she instantly stopped went to sleep i tried to feel swell and i tried to find that bump but it was nowhere to be found he said i am a he said he would be present when we needed him not a tomorrow help he's a help right now he's a help in this service when you need him he's the same yesterday today and forever you said seth but the body was declaring that she was sick yes but the standard declared that she was already healed when you don't change the standard you get the results and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto him sick hanker the sick handkerchiefs of aprons and the diseases departed from them and evil spirits went out of them i hope this is okay this is just the way i felt led to preach this evening was to give some testimonies if you want me to be at home let's just be at home we're all a part of the family of god one night about three in the morning my daughter woke up screaming all screaming as bad as she could scream and i couldn't comfort her and i began to realize that that was an evil spirit on my daughter and you know what i have weaknesses in this life i'm gonna go ahead and tell you i know you think because i'm a preacher i'm perfect but i'm not hard to believe preachers ain't perfect ain't it brother steve but i was sitting there and and you know i i began to i began to realize in the moment i didn't have enough faith to pray for my daughter but you know what i did realize that was my grandma gave me a prayer cloth from brother branham's meetings and i began to realize you know i said i might not have a lot of faith in myself right now but i've got a lot of faith in that cloth because i believe that that anointing is still on that cloth and i went and i grabbed that cloth from downstairs and i went back upstairs and i found i found my daughter laying there with my wife and she was screaming and and we we quoted that same scripture and after when as i was trying to read buddy that spirit tried to act up and got loud don't tell me spirits and demons ain't real brother i've seen it and then she started to act up more and more screaming more and more and more and as i began to pray i read that and she screamed more and i began to pray and quote the scripture and then the last thing i said i said in the name of the lord jesus christ we rebuke this spirit and she was screaming and screaming and screaming but when that prayer claw touched her leg she stopped instantly and that devil went flying out there because that's the standard you can turn to that when your children are sick when your family are sick you can grab that standard you can throw the devil out of your house with the word of god nothing is impossible hallelujah let me tell you something churches might do all these different things i joined in church and all this but let me tell you something hear it from my voice so you don't have an excuse acts 2 and 38 is still the standard you must repent oh and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you must be born again you can have all the riches like the rich young ruler had you can keep all the commandments and be a pretty good boy but when it comes down to it you'll walk away empty but if there's ever one time in your life that you line up with a standard and get the indwelling of the holy ghost watch out devil i hope you realize there's a reason you keep people overcoming and it ain't because of you because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that's your standard this evening here's another standard for you philippians 2 9. wherefore god has also highly exalted him that means to lift up and giving him a name which is above every name that the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth there's not a place that this name is not above a circumstance church of the living god you say well seth i've been dealing with this depression this sickness this lust this this alcoholism this tobacco-ism come on now we try to put band-aids on things we try to band-aid things up with antidepressants and every other thing in the world when we have a we have church of the living god do you if i could put it this way do you realize why at the end of world war ii nobody wanted to mess with america because they learned something we had an atomic power that was greater than every other power on the earth and i'm trying to tell you we have a name that's above every name on the earth above the earth and under the earth if you have a situation in your in your home don't call dr dobson call jesus christ he's the name above every name he's a name above every situation every depression every sickness church of the living god every fear every heartache and let me tell you something this evening he's the name above that stupid covet demon too he's the name above every name he's the name above every church problem he's the name above every family problem [Music] first time that name was ever spoken the first time that name was ever spoken mary went up to elizabeth and she said i've had this baby in my womb but it ain't moved and it was six months old and she said but what's his name what's his name man she said his name is jesus and that baby jumped alive i heard the name jesus one time when i was 15 years old heard it different than i ever heard it before and there was life that came into this womb and now i can't stop preaching i can't stop believing i can't stop dancing because jesus is the name above every circumstance in my life hallelujah when i was sick he healed me brother when i was depressed he gave me joy let me tell you this evening we've got something that's i want to call it too good to be true but you know what it's too good and it is true you can't lose this evening i'm not trying to get into to to politics and different things but but everybody kept saying and i don't know if it was or was it so don't even ask me i don't care but everybody kept saying the election was rigged the election was rigged it may have been or may not but if you want to see a rigged election look right here look at these people we didn't deserve to make it we didn't deserve to eternal life but god by his election that we were yet sinners christ died for us you're looking at a rigged election hallelujah when satan says he's guilty jesus said they're free hallelujah glory to god put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood look at your neighbor and say you ain't my enemy they are not your enemy but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having all done all to stand stand that's a commandment of the standard therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherefore ye shall be able ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked let me tell you something little sister you might feel overwhelmed you might feel like you can't go no further you might feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders and satan's gonna win but let me tell you something he will never overcome you because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he has lied to you over and over and over again but he will not prevail because god already has an overcomer and he will not blot your name out of that book [Music] [Applause] you can say what you want to but when i was in my study the lord said put that in your notes because there's going to be a sister that needs it [Music] i still believe in the inspiration of the holy ghost i still believe god can speak to men's hearts i still believe in the standard the same yesterday today and forever listen congregation he's hit you with a lot of darts and they hurt but you will not be overwhelmed you will not be overcome jesus has already won the victory but thanks be to god which give us the victory through our lord jesus christ ye are of god little children and overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh church nay and all these things we are more somebody say more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded i stand with paul on this can anybody stand with paul on this for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able it can try but it won't be able to separate us from the love of jesus christ glory i've been through a lot of trials i've had a lot of problems but it never separated me from the love of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah you say why are you dancing i went through the red sea brother you know what that red sea it was the blood of jesus christ and when i looked back every single one of my enemies was dead i serve a risen savior i serve a risen king [Music] [Applause] this body must come subject to the word of god that's why my shoulder don't hurt that's why my wrists don't hurt that was hurting on the way here [Music] because the standard said i was healed now faith faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker you ain't got to cope with that problem it isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it what is it it's faith what is the conqueror concrete is victory to conquer it means to beat down someone put that devil under your foot right now to override to handcraft to throw it into prison it means that the sin the sin that once ruled you you rule it it means that you've overcome it you are you've whipped it you are greater than it is he said oh i feel religious right now and i can agree with that which was which was first a sinner or a savior a savior for a savior is more powerful than sin which was first the healer or a sickness oh church of the living god he couldn't be a healer unless he was over the sickness it's a healer it can conquer the sickness and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil every cursed church faith is the victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your creed not faith in some man but faith in jesus christ who made the promise you know what when a man tells the truth he can tell the story the same every time when a man tells the truth he can tell the story the same every time you tell a lie you got 20 different interpretations but when you tell the truth and there's no lie in you it's the truth every time that's why these promises never wear out i just bought i bought i bought a little card from my sister and it says valid from this date to that date for coupons i'm so glad we are we are serving a god that is not bound from date to date but he tells the truth every time the bible does not have an expiration date on it the word of god will never have an expiration date on it because it was written by an eternal being do you realize there's a lot of people that say a lot of things about you a lot of people that say a lot of negative but if the king of the universe could look down on us and see us in the sinful nature that we were in and he could say you know what brother stephen i want to die for them [Music] why in the world would you ever care what anybody else thinks about you what anybody else says about you why would you care how they see you worship [Music] [Applause] i'm going to tell you something right now i was a 15 year old drinking smoking woman chasing man but jesus christ came into my life 12 years ago and completely changed me from the inside out is the message alive is the message dealing in young people you ain't got to have no modern message or say the message don't work if you just believe the standard believe the message it'll change your life stop listening to the devil ain't no truth in him ever since the beginning he's been telling lies in heaven trying to convince the angels follow me don't follow this jesus go to the garden lied deceived eve still trying to do it today but we try to lend the ear to him what do you want to say oh i'm sick oh my shoulder won't be made well oh i don't feel good okay no he ain't never told the truth and the truth ain't in him but jesus said i am the way i am the truth i am the life his power is unmatched all the devil can do is pervert all he can do is speak lies and pervert let me say this church of the living god i believe that god is so much greater than the devil and i say this if satan has ever perverted something with his power how much more can god restore with his power how much more if god is so much greater i don't care how far satan has took you i don't care how many roses took you down there is nothing that is greater than the grace of god all satan can do is lie [Music] all satan can do is lie and his words have no power but let me tell you something jesus words oh there was a dead man behind a tomb named lazarus one day but when the standard old church i want you to know death was the standard until the standard walked in and when the standard walked up to the two his body said he was dead they said he stinketh by now jesus said what's that to me i thought you said you believed now listen you came here to church tonight tonight because you said you believed that's why you're here but this man's words this man's standard when a body was dead behind a tomb laying in a tomb when he was laying there and he said loose him and let him go lazarus come forth death had to give way to the standard so don't ask jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever you hear me right now if you hear anything you hear this right now jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if jesus's words could bring a dead man back to life he could bring jarice's daughter back to life could bring his own life that he laid down and resurrected again if jesus's words can do that don't you dare tell me that your situation is too bad for my jesus to bring you out this is why i believe the message of the hour there is still people raised from the dead there is still sick healed and soon and very soon there's a people gonna take a body chance [Music] one more we'll go brother brandon said there may not be a chance for you to live you may be dying with cancer you may be bound to a wheelchair you may be totally behind i don't know what your trouble is but if you'll take the chief doctor's prescription whatsoever thing you desire when you pray believe you receive it and shall have it and believe that faith will overcome any difficulty that there is you may be so burdened with sin until your soul is smutty as it can be you may have tried to get rid of that ill temper and slandering tongue that gossip on the telephone hello you might have tried every remedy you know but if you just let jesus christ come into you tonight he'll operate on your faith and give you a faith that will climb beyond anything that the world can produce why faith is the victory that overcomes the world faith by what hearing of the word of god my faith don't come from apostolic tabernacle that's not where i draw my faith from come from the eternal word of god as long as i'm here as long as we're here let's lift up the standard over every trial over every devitt devil over every principality over every we lift up the standard over every lost family member over every sickness over every need in our church over every need in my body i don't care i don't care what these senses say as jonah was these are all lying vanities but this is the truth i take my life on this this is the truth [Music] i finished with this why would you battle the devil how many years has the devil told you you wouldn't make it and still but every time he knocks you down you get back up you are an invincible army church not because seth coffey not because brother stephen as much as i admire this man but i admire a greater woman and his name is jesus christ and he said this church i will be with you even in you church what life is on the inside of you it's the very life giver [Music] that's why you can't be defeated because he's in you you would have confidence if jesus christ came and stepped in this building and walked down the street to a bunch of devils you would say he's going to get them he's going to wear them out and even when he came to the legion of devils they recognized the standard as much as they tormented that man when they came running to him they said thou son of god why have you come to persecute us before our time now if you believe that jesus could do that if he was in the building walking i'm here to tell you that that same jesus through the holy ghost is dwelling on the inside of each and every one of you let it be a legion of devils let it be what it be but there is nothing that can stand in the way of a holy ghost field child of almighty god i believe in one place brother branham said if the holy ghost is in you you have the requirement for the rapture if you can have that requirement for the rapture how much more can you have the requirement to step on some devil's heads [Music] [Applause] you say i feel worthless it's all in the value is in the eyes of the beholder look around you're the reason he died you're the reason he went down to hell you're the reason he kicked the devil in the face and took the keys and said these are for my people he thought that much of you if you ever wonder when you look when you go to purchase something you say how much does it cost how much is the value how much are you willing to pay for this and jesus said i'll pay with my own blood i want them you're worth it you are the purchase of god's own life heavenly father [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh oh heavenly father lord when we look at you lord what do we see this evening lord the lord i can't hardly talk lord i can't find the words to say the lord i can say this lord your word is sin has done what you sent it out to do god father we love you lord this evening lord lord we just want to take a moment lord oh god lord to say thank you lord father o god lord we thank you lord god tonight lord god that you have given us the victory tonight lord that every enemy is defeated almighty god lord we thank you that you have come into this place lord god lord that when the enemy lord came in like a flood lord god you rose up this standard against it this evening almighty god lord the devil might have been plotting lord god he might have been trying lord to kill your bride lord god he might have had it playing for a long time lord god but lord you rose up the standard this evening lord it wasn't me god but lord it was your word that came forth almighty god lord you have proven this evening almighty god that there is nothing that can stand in your way god i pray that every member of this congregation would realize that satan is no match for them father you said you have overcome lord you already overcame the world and lord we're just resting in your blood lord lord we're resting lord believing that we are the purchase of that blood father this bride cannot be over overwhelmed lord god overtaken oh god because god she has the standard dwelling on the inside of her father it's the word bride lord dressed in the message of the hour father lord i don't even feel like i should close god [Music] yes yes satan you lost another one satan you lost another battle satan i'm here to tell you you're nothing but a bluff you're nothing but a loser every time you've tried to defeat jesus in heaven he cast you out in your own home he kicked in the door and took your keys and in your eden he is overcoming through the bride of jesus christ satan you have always been a loser you will always be a loser but we are victorious through jesus christ who died for us heavenly father i pray lord that these people lord god would continue to feel the liberty to worship you lord lord god i must i must hand the service back over god but lord i want to say lord it was a privilege to speak to your people god it was a privilege to lift the name of jesus above every circumstance it was a privilege lord god to be healed by you it was a privilege lord god to see you deliver your children lord lord i do this for no other reason lord god i don't care about a name for myself god but if they remember the name of jesus christ if they remember the spirit of god that came and delivered them if they remember the standard that stood up in the service god that's all i care about god let that be what's remembered jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever lord i love you lord i praise you god lord have your will and way in the rest of the service god [Music] in jesus name [Music] how do i say thank you [Music] [Music] yes hallelujah [Music] so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west in his glory from the rising of the sun hallelujah when the enemy shall come in like a flood oh aren't you so glad you don't end at their church when the enemy shall come in like a flood when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him oh oh oh let's pray heavenly father lord we can never over emphasize the brazen altar for your children lord now we understand again more why the very entrance of the tabernacle that's the first thing that was put right there to always begin from the cross because from the cross you did everything no wonder at the end lord you spoke you say it is finished because you know that the remaining of the journey through the tabernacle is going to be nothing else but the result of what happened the consequences of what happened at the brazen altar father many lambs were killed in the old testament from hours after hours lord many blood has been shed in the temple order father trying to satisfy the requirement for sin but lord all that the blood of bulls and goat could do was only lord a covering and your children has been held in paradise but father one day you walk toward jordan the very river lord father that was representing death and father you brought a different standard where the lamb was no longer a an animal but the lamb was a human being and he was not any ordinary human being it was god himself that was made flesh in the body and that body was the body of jesus christ and father you went to the water and you came out and you were presented as the lamb of god the perfect atonement the anti-type lord the one every lamb from evil all the way to you lord was
