come to First Corinthians chapter 2 let me just read a few verses verse from verse 4. the Apostle Paul now you know the he's speaking now of the the Christians revelation and he said and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God albeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the prince of this world that cometh do not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden Mystery which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory they did not know who was in their midst but as it is written eyes have not seen now here's heard neither of it entered into the heart of men the things which God has prepared for them that love him may the Lord of this blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated hallelujah praise God Amen we thank God for the word we thank God for the legacy of the word amen praise God hallelujah and you know my family I greet them this
