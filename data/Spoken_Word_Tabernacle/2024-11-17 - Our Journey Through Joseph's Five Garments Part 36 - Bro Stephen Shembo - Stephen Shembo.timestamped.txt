[25:01] I really want to thank God for his grace
[25:04] and
[25:05] mercy and the
[25:07] reminder by our precious Pastor that we
[25:10] are gods and that our words matter am so
[25:15] last year when we were home there's a a
[25:18] couple friend of ours uh was it was in
[25:22] January just early January they came by
[25:25] to visit us and they had been trying so
[25:30] hard to get a baby and they had not been
[25:34] able to so the uh the man the brother
[25:40] he's he's not a brother in the message
[25:42] but whatever they are believing they
[25:44] really are dedicated to it um it's I I
[25:49] believe it's it's a denomination if you
[25:51] look at them they you would think
[25:52] they're Believers no makeup no earring
[25:55] long dresses but they're not message
[25:57] believers
[25:59] so we sat down and we talked to them and
[26:05] um me and my husband we kind of celled
[26:07] them a little bit he's a police officer
[26:10] so you know that work is very
[26:12] stressful so when we cell them you know
[26:16] sometimes you can give counsel and
[26:17] somebody doesn't take it but they took
[26:20] it to heart and they implemented
[26:24] everything and in the process I told
[26:27] them it just something just just an
[26:30] inspiration dropped in me and I said by
[26:33] this time next year when we come back
[26:36] you'll be having a
[26:37] baby and I believed it when I said that
[26:42] and so every time I think of them I just
[26:45] thank God for giving them a baby so I
[26:48] posted some pictures on WhatsApp for our
[26:50] anniversary and they responded and
[26:53] something just dropped in me and said
[26:55] call make the call so I asked are you
[26:59] available for a call he said yes so I
[27:01] called and I really wanted to ask
[27:05] but I held back and before I could we
[27:10] could talk more he said guess what we
[27:11] wanted to tell you something I said
[27:14] Hallelujah I was just before they even
[27:17] even said what it is hallelujah I just
[27:19] started rejoicing and they are nine
[27:22] eight um 6 months

[57:50] to us and keep our mind focused into
[57:52] your word be the beginning and the
[57:54] ending of this service in the name of
[57:57] Jesus Christ amen verse six the Bible
[58:01] says I have said this is God talking
[58:06] that ye are Gods amen and all of you are
[58:12] children of the most high the most high
[58:16] when I read scripture like this in my in
[58:20] if I am a child of God I will be
[58:22] screaming
[58:24] amen because because I'm not a child of
[58:27] the
[58:29] devil God is confirming me that I am his
[58:33] child and I should be happy when God say
[58:36] you are my son despite your failure
[58:39] despite everything that you have done
[58:42] God still remember that you are his
[58:44] child amen glory to God so verse six
[58:48] again deal with a Divine report or a
[58:53] Divine record amen amen glory to God
[58:59] this is verse 6 and verse seven is
[59:02] dealing with something else glory to
[59:07] God praise God verse S say but you shall
[59:12] die like men and fall like one of the
[59:17] princes this one is talking about a
[59:21] record of this Earth from our father
[59:25] from our family from all our
[59:28] failure amen this is where we got it
[59:32] this one is a clean one and this is an
[59:35] eternal one amen this one is
[59:40] temporal because one of this day you
[59:42] won't even have a choice of sin
[59:45] amen amen if you thought maybe when you
[59:49] were younger in the world and in your
[59:52] fight somebody cut you up and you have a
[59:55] scar that's it amen there will be a time
[59:57] you won't have that
[59:59] scar glory to God the only one who will
[1:00:02] keep scar is the Lord Jesus
[1:00:07] Christ amen because he have to show the
[1:00:10] Jews those
[1:00:11] scar but me and
[1:00:14] you me and you we won't keep any scar
[1:00:18] there will come a time there won't be
[1:00:19] any choice of sin because the bride will
[1:00:23] be without spot or
[1:00:27] rinkor rinkor is because of sin and
[1:00:31] because of death that the reason why we
[1:00:33] are aging but any Chace of sin and death
[1:00:37] will be completely removed until we'll
[1:00:40] be spotless
[1:00:44] amen even if you battle with something
[1:00:47] on your skin you won't see that anymore
[1:00:48] no sir God don't want you to remember
[1:00:52] anything negative Amen in your life amen
[1:00:59] and the point about this one is God is
[1:01:02] aware of the two record
[1:01:05] amen so when the devil come to accuse
[1:01:08] you it's not a
[1:01:12] news he's the accuser the accuser
[1:01:15] because he want to stay right here he
[1:01:18] want to talk about this record so much
[1:01:20] but we and the devil we were there at
[1:01:23] the beginning why doesn't the devil want
[1:01:25] to talk about what we did in
[1:01:29] heaven amen amen there was a lot of
[1:01:33] stuff the sons of God were doing in
[1:01:35] heaven he doesn't tell at all he always
[1:01:38] hide about that part he want to talk
[1:01:40] about what happened here on Earth so it
[1:01:43] is your responsibility to remind the
[1:01:46] devil that I got not the record that we
[1:01:50] need to talk about amen therefore do you
[1:01:52] remember when we were in heaven and when
[1:01:55] we were creating and our father was
[1:01:58] creating and we were shouting for Joy
[1:02:00] amen and we were singing like the
[1:02:02] Morning Star do you remember that time
[1:02:05] do you remember how we kick you out from
[1:02:08] Heaven
[1:02:11] amen and we didn't kick you only you he
[1:02:15] will kick you and all your Devils do you
[1:02:18] remember how you tried to Ambush the
[1:02:20] Lord in heaven and I stood by the Lord
[1:02:24] you know how many I give
[1:02:27] you that's the reason why we put you
[1:02:29] down here don't be intimidated by Satan
[1:02:34] you need to be on offense amen not on
[1:02:40] defense if you want to tell the story
[1:02:42] tell the whole story don't hide anything
[1:02:46] you can talk about me I can also talk
[1:02:49] about you and I can talk about your
[1:02:51] future and where you going to end up you
[1:02:54] will never gain your position in heaven
[1:02:58] but my position is eternal no matter
[1:03:01] what you can tell me no matter what you
[1:03:04] can tell people on this Earth You will
[1:03:06] never I will never lose my position in
[1:03:09] heaven but your position there you will
[1:03:12] never regain it again you lost it
[1:03:16] forever but man is still there so go
[1:03:19] ahead and tell it

[1:03:31] up we reach a point you cannot be
[1:03:34] tormented by the devil in your mind you
[1:03:39] need to shut the devil
[1:03:43] up and tell him you barking at the wrong
[1:03:46] door you talking to somebody who knows
[1:03:49] who they are you talking about somebody
[1:03:52] who have recognized their position

[1:04:15] too late before the foundation of the
[1:04:18] world God chose me before I have done
[1:04:22] anything God already elected me and God
[1:04:26] won't change his mind about me whether

[1:17:12] the Bible says and the
[1:17:14] younger of them the one who was born
[1:17:17] later say to his father father give me
[1:17:22] the portion of goods that fall to me and
[1:17:26] he divided to them his living we know
[1:17:29] that the firstborn according to the law
[1:17:32] get a double portion you understand this
[1:17:34] now amen and the second one get a third
[1:17:38] amen but remember father was still
[1:17:42] alive we clear everything belonged to
[1:17:45] the father he was still alive but
[1:17:47] despite the fact that the father was
[1:17:50] alive amen the youngest son remove a
[1:17:53] third yes yes from the father and
[1:17:57] everything that was left for the father
[1:17:59] is two3 or a double portion yes amen am
[1:18:05] he was still the father follow me but he
[1:18:09] was the portion of the oldest
[1:18:13] son amen he belongs to the father
[1:18:17] because he's still alive right but truly
[1:18:20] he belongs to the
[1:18:23] Jews amen
[1:18:25] and the younger one took his portion and
[1:18:27] finished it up and came back and enter
[1:18:31] into the two
[1:18:37] third let me go back again normally when
[1:18:40] the young son came back there was
[1:18:42] nothing for him empty but when he came
[1:18:45] back the father be to uzee the
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:18:50] robe the robe belongs to the old one the
[1:18:54] ring belongs to the old one the fatted
[1:18:57] Cal that they have to kill belong
[1:19:01] to is my Bible different than your Bible
[1:19:04] so don't start this way it's a B52 my
[1:19:06] friend so the so whatever the father was
[1:19:09] using belongs to the oldest
[1:19:13] son don't worry let me stabilize
[1:19:16] somebody jump to verse 30 jum jum to
[1:19:19] verse 31 let me stabilize

[1:19:31] for take off you there 37 and he said
[1:19:36] Son you are ever with
[1:19:39] who and all that I have is what why did
[1:19:44] the father say everything that I have is
[1:19:47] mine because the father already divided
[1:19:50] the two things amen but because the
[1:19:53] father is still alive
[1:19:55] the older son is not entit
[1:19:58] anything but the younger uses what he
[1:20:01] has and he goes back again and begin to
[1:20:04] use what belongs to the other
[1:20:07] one and the old one is coming angry and
[1:20:11] the father said the double portion have
[1:20:13] always been
[1:20:15] yours but the younger one can tap into
[1:20:18] the double
[1:20:20] portion and pull the best
[1:20:23] robe and pull the ring and pull the
[1:20:27] shoes and pull the fatted calf and
[1:20:30] everything that goes with a
[1:20:34] feast he's
[1:20:36] utilizing the inheritance of the
[1:20:41] Jew I I hope we are together are we
[1:20:45] together are we
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:49] together all right jump to verse
[1:20:53] uh uh we 12 and the younger of them said
[1:20:57] to his father father give me the portion
[1:21:00] of the goods that fell to me and he
[1:21:04] divided to them his what living so his
[1:21:07] living was divided so everything that
[1:21:09] was left belong to the oldest one we
[1:21:12] clear there now verse 13 and not many
[1:21:16] days after that after I'm sorry the
[1:21:19] youngest son gathered all together and
[1:21:23] took his journey in into what a far
[1:21:25] country so there there was a separation
[1:21:28] that was created between the father and
[1:21:32] the younger son the father and the
[1:21:35] younger son
[1:21:39] separate amen
[1:21:42] amen a separation and this separation
[1:21:45] was not a closed
[1:21:47] one it was a big
[1:21:50] one amen amen in other word it was hard
[1:21:53] for the Young son to reach daddy that's
[1:21:57] right the distance between Daddy and the
[1:22:01] youngest son was so great compared to
[1:22:05] the oldest
[1:22:07] son if you really want to get in contact
[1:22:10] with the father you need to go through
[1:22:12] the youngest through the oldest
[1:22:16] son if you go to the youngest son he's
[1:22:19] so far away from daddy that you cannot
[1:22:22] get access from there the only people
[1:22:25] that were close to
[1:22:29] Jehovah you want to know about God's law
[1:22:33] you want to know about God's commandment
[1:22:35] you want to know about the will of God
[1:22:37] you want to know whatever God is doing
[1:22:39] in this world brother Bram say you want
[1:22:41] to even know the time of God you need to
[1:22:45] look at the jew they the one that are
[1:22:48] closer to the father we were Gentile far
[1:22:52] away having Club on back worshiping ad
[1:22:56] so far
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:00] away are we together it's a B52 my
[1:23:04] friend we are on verse uh 13 13 and not
[1:23:09] many days after that the younger son
[1:23:12] gathered all together and took his
[1:23:15] journey into a what a far country
[1:23:18] remember Ephesians say we were far away
[1:23:20] from the common wealth of Israel you
[1:23:23] remember that and we were without God
[1:23:26] but the God who is rich in Mercy we were
[1:23:30] alienated from God you remember Ephesian
[1:23:32] to and the Bible says there he wasted
[1:23:36] his substance with riotous living and
[1:23:39] this wasting when we look at that it was
[1:23:46] withed are you up to date with the
[1:23:50] sermon sir this wasting was with what
[1:23:53] harot
[1:23:56] churches you know this now
[1:23:59] organizations sir amen
[1:24:04] denominations amen so the younger one
[1:24:07] will go through
[1:24:11] denominations the younger one will go
[1:24:13] through
[1:24:14] denominations amen before coming back to
[1:24:18] the father and in denomination we are
[1:24:21] wasting the father substance
[1:24:25] keep following me very good because the
[1:24:28] energy God gave you is not to worship
[1:24:30] the
[1:24:31] devil the gift God gave us is not to
[1:24:36] make a name on
[1:24:37] ourself it is not to use God gift so we
[1:24:41] can be popular so we can be counted
[1:24:44] among ministers or counted among pastors
[1:24:48] all counted among
[1:24:50] singers the gift is to Magnify Him but
[1:24:54] if you don't pay attention a
[1:24:57] denominational spirit will make you
[1:25:00] waste the gift for your own
[1:25:06] purpose are we together amen are we
[1:25:09] together amen when you want to do
[1:25:11] something look at the motives look at
[1:25:13] the objective that you're trying to do
[1:25:15] amen if it's to glorify yourself cut it
[1:25:18] off that's right because you wasting the
[1:25:20] father's substance that's right but if
[1:25:22] it's to help his children uhhuh and to
[1:25:25] bring them to a closer relationship with
[1:25:28] God then you using the substance of the
[1:25:31] father correctly amen are we together
[1:25:35] amen are we together amen praise God
[1:25:39] watch now verse 14 and when he had
[1:25:42] spaned
[1:25:44] all there arose a mighty what famine in
[1:25:47] that land continue my friend and he
[1:25:49] began to be in want and he begin to be
[1:25:52] in want amen
[1:25:55] and he went and joined himself to a
[1:25:57] citizen of that country and he sent him
[1:26:00] into the field to feed water swine and
[1:26:03] he would uh fent in other word he would
[1:26:06] gladly desire have filled his belly with
[1:26:09] the husk that the swan did it amen and
[1:26:13] no man gave it to him follow me
[1:26:17] carefully this boy the younger one
[1:26:20] you're going to see your life my friend
[1:26:23] in a far away
[1:26:24] country he had two
[1:26:29] phases amen there was a phase that he
[1:26:33] had the substance of the
[1:26:35] father amen and when the substance of
[1:26:39] the father was in his hand amen he spend
[1:26:44] his time with
[1:26:47] harot are we together amen then when the
[1:26:51] substance was pent up that's what the
[1:26:53] Bible say
[1:26:54] amen there arose when all everything was
[1:26:58] spent all amen suddenly the famine
[1:27:04] came it looks like that
[1:27:07] famine was
[1:27:10] waiting I'm reading the Bible that
[1:27:14] famine was wedding sir it looks like
[1:27:17] famine was there looking in the bank
[1:27:20] account
[1:27:24] when money was there fine was quiet when
[1:27:28] money was there fine was quiet when
[1:27:30] money was there fine was quiet because
[1:27:33] if fine comes when money is there money
[1:27:36] will
[1:27:39] conquer are we together but this fine
[1:27:44] waited until everything was spent in
[1:27:49] other word no more money amen bank
[1:27:52] account of a draft
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:57] negative when that happen
[1:28:01] suddenly femine kicking so the spending
[1:28:05] on of all was coupled with
[1:28:11] famine amen amen so the first phase is
[1:28:16] the pH of
[1:28:18] substance are we together the second
[1:28:21] phase is a phase without
[1:28:26] substance amen amen and the purpose of
[1:28:31] this fine was to begin to make him
[1:28:38] uncomfortable because he was not in a
[1:28:41] correct
[1:28:44] country
[1:28:46] am are we together he was far away from
[1:28:50] home and he forgot that way he got into
[1:28:53] it amen completely put him under
[1:28:59] Amnesia are we together that's the
[1:29:01] reason why he have to come back to
[1:29:04] himself because he was under Amnesia
[1:29:07] completely he forgot who he was amen
[1:29:11] living with harot and everything so God
[1:29:16] waited until every potential that he has
[1:29:21] was
[1:29:22] depleted amen when the potential was
[1:29:25] depleted God turned on the famine so the
[1:29:29] famine for this child is not a curse no
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:37] sir if you a child of the devil it a
[1:29:41] curse the famine for this son the
[1:29:44] difficulty the
[1:29:47] hardship the trial yes sir the trouble
[1:29:51] sir the pressure that was put upon this
[1:29:55] child was not to destroy him he was the
[1:29:59] father begin to work on
[1:30:04] him I hope we are okay now amen amen he
[1:30:10] was the father that was working on him
[1:30:13] when
[1:30:14] famine started it was the beginning of
[1:30:19] the end
[1:30:23] [Laughter]
[1:30:25] if I lost you you raise your hand when
[1:30:28] famine started it was the
[1:30:31] beginning amen of the
[1:30:35] end he was not ready to go home yet he
[1:30:39] still want to linger he still loves the
[1:30:43] country but he was the beginning of the

[1:30:51] be in a church
[1:30:54] and you comfortable for a time and for a
[1:30:57] long time you stay comfortable even
[1:31:01] though you are eating harot

[1:31:07] food ah no problem I never was in a
[1:31:10] Baptist Church you might be in a message
[1:31:15] church and you are comfortable for years
[1:31:19] where no one preaches
[1:31:22] Doctrine no one preaches even the church
[1:31:25] ages no one will touch even the seals no
[1:31:29] one will give you solid food for years
[1:31:33] you live like a Baptist under a message
[1:31:37] roof and suddenly Things become
[1:31:41] uncomfortable it is the father
[1:31:43] pressurizing you because he want to move
[1:31:47] you toward a different
[1:31:51] position because you getting into a
[1:31:54] critical

[1:40:18] citizen amen and when he joined this
[1:40:21] citizen this citizen
[1:40:23] was an owner of fields that's
[1:40:28] right let's read

[1:41:24] stop what was the swan eating
[1:41:31] H right brother
[1:41:34] John amen he moved from Harlot Follow Me
[1:41:39] Now harlots were
[1:41:43] denomination are we together which were
[1:41:47] churches amen but those hot were for
[1:41:51] that country do you follow me
[1:41:54] when famine comes it was the
[1:41:59] Beginning of the
[1:42:01] End Amen in the beginning of the end he
[1:42:06] didn't go
[1:42:07] home he joined with a citizen and that
[1:42:11] citizen turned him to a
[1:42:16] worker are you following me are we are
[1:42:19] you following me so the citizen was the
[1:42:22] boss living good but the one he was boss
[1:42:27] of were trying to eat
[1:42:32] husks William Marion Branham brother
[1:42:36] Branham says in the exposition of the
[1:42:38] seven Church ages in the Philadelphian
[1:42:40] church he says the
[1:42:42] clergy lived in
[1:42:46] luxury amen mhm while the poor Church
[1:42:51] fed on h of what
[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:42:57] abuse I didn't write the Bible I didn't
[1:43:00] write the message of brother Bram one
[1:43:03] thing that I know the Bible and the
[1:43:05] message are perfectly in order they are
[1:43:08] one the clergy the
[1:43:11] citizen of the country the
[1:43:17] clergy have i l you no sir the
[1:43:21] clergy the citizen of the country live
[1:43:25] in
[1:43:26] luxury when the
[1:43:28] church the one who came to join the
[1:43:32] church is living on husks and brother
[1:43:36] Bram say the husks of
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:44] abuse a preacher sleeping with women in
[1:43:47] the churches no problem in this message
[1:43:51] and not one age did any different each
[1:43:56] bound itself to what organization and
[1:43:59] put the government upon man and commit
[1:44:02] the church to that what government they
[1:44:05] let the people do what rise up and they
[1:44:08] were brutally house suppress they don't
[1:44:10] want the people to be free when the
[1:44:13] people try to rise up and say something
[1:44:16] they inflict them and push them down you
[1:44:19] stay there amen every denomination
[1:44:23] has the same spirit so when a church is
[1:44:30] abused in this message by a pastor who's
[1:44:35] taking advantage of people in the church
[1:44:38] that's a
[1:44:41] [Applause]
[1:44:44] denomination Pastor should
[1:44:50] respect women and young girls in the
[1:44:54] church we should not even have a problem
[1:44:57] or Pastor having Affairs in the church
[1:45:00] but there is abuse that went on into the
[1:45:03] dis message under the name of a clergy
[1:45:06] and it's a denomination of spirit where
[1:45:10] young men are like puet workers that are
[1:45:14] working for the big boss you not working
[1:45:17] for me you working for
[1:45:19] [Applause]
[1:45:21] God I am only God manager I am a steward
[1:45:26] of what belongs to
[1:45:29] God people feel the pastor more than
[1:45:33] [Applause]
[1:45:39] God if you tell
[1:45:42] somebody I'm going to tell
[1:45:44] God get out I'm going to tell the pastor
[1:45:48] please I'm sorry
[1:45:49] [Applause]
[1:45:53] who do you
[1:45:54] fear who do you Fe who do you Fe are we
[1:45:59] together is everybody alive so they ask
[1:46:03] this boy follow me at the beginning of
[1:46:06] the end he never went home he moved from
[1:46:09] a denomination to a place that he begin
[1:46:13] to eat husk what does husk
[1:46:19] mean williiam Marion Bram me I don't
[1:46:22] know what to preach I only preach what
[1:46:24] brother Bram preaching in the message
[1:46:27] the Masterpiece brother Bram say but
[1:46:30] what denominated does what
[1:46:34] dies like life in who Luther a
[1:46:39] harlot went to make what Wesley a
[1:46:43] harlot from Wesley he went to what
[1:46:47] Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the
[1:46:50] what the original sea onto Pentecost
[1:46:53] came out who Wesley until that time the
[1:46:57] reason that Pentecost came out of Wesley
[1:47:00] because he was no what denomination
[1:47:03] Pentecost was then Pentecost went to
[1:47:06] what denominate what did he do it turned
[1:47:10] into a what
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:16] the are we together are we together so
[1:47:20] the Pentecostal at the beginning
[1:47:23] of the
[1:47:24] end at the beginning of the LI aition
[1:47:29] churches amen a move came called the
[1:47:33] Pentecost and brother Bram said they
[1:47:35] turn into a
[1:47:38] HK amen Oh Glory to God Amen he look
[1:47:43] like what P he looked like the real
[1:47:48] thing Pentecost came out of what the
[1:47:51] Wesley because Wesley was what an
[1:47:53] organization Harlot Pentecost came out
[1:47:56] as no organization and then it turned
[1:47:59] into one and he had
[1:48:02] to to make the H the True Word of Life
[1:48:07] on it was on its
[1:48:11] way then to the what original grain so
[1:48:14] the child when famine begin to come he
[1:48:18] went to a Pentecostal organization
[1:48:21] before heading home
[1:48:27] I'm going slowly my friend he says the
[1:48:30] says the True Word of Life was on its
[1:48:34] way then to the original what grain
[1:48:37] through what these stages through the
[1:48:39] what the stock then what into the pollen
[1:48:41] from pollen into the what the husk and
[1:48:44] from the husk he made what SE if you
[1:48:47] notice after he finished with the czm he
[1:48:50] went straight home there is no other
[1:48:53] step after the citizen with the H there
[1:48:57] is no other blockage after you go
[1:48:59] through l through W through Pentecost
[1:49:02] which is the last organization the boy
[1:49:05] went
[1:49:06] home
[1:49:08] Hallelujah are we together are we
[1:49:11] together are we together Lord help me
[1:49:16] brother brother say and notice them the
[1:49:19] what the husk when he comes forth look
[1:49:23] just like what the grain but when the
[1:49:25] grain Life begin to leave the what the H
[1:49:28] to go to make what the grain which is
[1:49:31] what the bride so the bride is the
[1:49:33] original
[1:49:41] grain okay the husk did what opens up
[1:49:45] and did what ex communicates the grave
[1:49:47] you going to be pushed out
[1:49:51] [Applause]
[1:49:53] he communicate the gra is that right

[1:50:42] when the boy was in the state with a HK
[1:50:45] that's right that's when the pillar of

[1:51:06] Servants of my fathers have what bread
[1:51:08] enough and to spare and as perish here
[1:51:11] with what with Hunger when the boy came

[1:51:16] himself he begin to remember H's food
[1:51:26] he begin to remember home
[1:51:31] bread are we together are we together
[1:51:35] but the bread that he was remembering
[1:51:38] was the bread of the
[1:51:43] servant it's the same Bible we read all
[1:51:46] along the bread he was remembering was
[1:51:50] the bread of the servant amen are we

[2:00:34] life is who Christ the bread of life
[2:00:37] that came down from heaven is who Christ
[2:00:40] that's why the Bible say he was the
[2:00:42] hidden manner am the Bible in the book
[2:00:45] of revation say that Jesus Christ was
[2:00:48] the hidden man do you know that do you
[2:00:52] know that so Jesus was a manner that was
[2:00:58] hidden I don't know if you getting me
[2:01:01] it's a manner that was
[2:01:03] hidden a manner that was
[2:01:07] hidden it was not
[2:01:09] open Slow Down slow down a man that was
[2:01:14] hidden slow down we getting
[2:01:18] somewhere are we together I told you I'm
[2:01:21] having a B52 it's a manner that was what
[2:01:26] the hidden you see Pentecost say hidden
[2:01:28] manner hidden manner you need to know
[2:01:30] what hidden manner means are we together
[2:01:34] are we together verse 48 what did he say
[2:01:37] I am what that bread of life your
[2:01:40] fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness
[2:01:44] and are dead separated this is the bread
[2:01:48] which came down from what heaven that a
[2:01:51] man eats thereof and not die I
[2:01:58] am the what the living bread the living
[2:02:02] bread which came down from what heaven
[2:02:05] so the living Mana is
[2:02:08] Christ because Mana was the bread from
[2:02:11] Heaven amen but the true bread is Christ
[2:02:15] amen I am the living bread which came
[2:02:18] down from what heaven If any man do what
[2:02:21] eat of this bread he shall live how
[2:02:24] forever and the bread that I will give
[2:02:27] is my
[2:02:30] flesh the Flesh of the son of man is my
[2:02:34] flesh which I will give for life of the
[2:02:39] what world follow me carefully what are
[2:02:43] you trying to say
[2:02:46] pastor this boy are we together desire
[2:02:51] the angel
[2:02:52] food and the food of the servant he said
[2:02:57] in my father house the my servant the
[2:03:01] servant of my father have bread and they
[2:03:05] have bread to eat and to spare so when
[2:03:09] the boy came back to
[2:03:11] himself what brought him back connect
[2:03:15] him to the food or the bread of the
[2:03:20] servant and the bread of the servant is
[2:03:24] the bread of the
[2:03:25] Angel and the bread of the Angel was
[2:03:29] mana and Jesus say Mana was the bread
[2:03:33] that came down from heaven but Jesus
[2:03:35] said your father ate that Mana but they
[2:03:39] were dead but the true Mana is me myself
[2:03:43] because I came down from heaven so the
[2:03:46] Mana from Heaven is what Crist at the
[2:03:51] beginning it looks like angel food but
[2:03:55] if you turn it to the right it's going
[2:03:58] to look like
[2:03:59] [Applause]
[2:04:04] trrust at the beginning it was seven
[2:04:08] angels that brought this message but
[2:04:11] when we turn the picture it is not seven
[2:04:14] angels it is Crist in the middle of the
[2:04:17] picture
[2:04:25] and they call Jesus Christ the hidden
[2:04:28] what he was a cross that was locked a
[2:04:32] cross that was sealed a cross that was
[2:04:35] locked for their generation so this boy
[2:04:39] needed a word to be
[2:04:44] open that's why when he was coming home
[2:04:48] he was not the servant he was the father
[2:04:51] himself
[2:04:52] [Applause]
[2:04:53] that came to meet him decl
[2:04:56] himself because the bread was the bread
[2:04:59] of the father when you see my father you
[2:05:02] see
[2:05:03] [Applause]
[2:05:10] bread are we together are we together
[2:05:14] it's not Angel my friend it is true it's
[2:05:18] Angelic food but if you turn it is
[2:05:22] Christ Hall amen every day one Angel
[2:05:25] come and give the food one Angel come
[2:05:28] and give the food but when we put
[2:05:30] together and brother Bram say seven
[2:05:31] Angel seven Angel God say boy turn the
[2:05:34] picture to the
[2:05:36] right amen it is not Angel really turn
[2:05:40] the picture to the right because God has
[2:05:42] seven
[2:05:44] [Applause]
[2:05:47] Spirit and the Bible say there are seven
[2:05:50] spirit of God God and brother Bram say
[2:05:53] it is not seven different Spirit but is
[2:05:56] one Spirit who can manifest itself in
[2:05:59] seven ways but when you take those seven
[2:06:02] spirit and you put it together and you
[2:06:05] change the angle that you looking at you
[2:06:07] want to see Christ this message is
[2:06:11] [Applause]

[2:06:37] mercy do you see how many layers there
[2:06:39] are in this
[2:06:41] scripture it's a food that you cannot
[2:06:45] finish when you eat you eat you full
[2:06:48] this Su but there are some to spare

[2:22:39] Marcus if you look at the Bible it means
[2:22:43] a
[2:22:46] king or a ruler
[2:22:48] [Applause]
[2:22:59] are we together so when the pressure of
[2:23:02] the
[2:23:03] ecuminical begin to come upon Jesus
[2:23:06] Christ upon the son of man we find a
[2:23:10] servant of the high priest who is
[2:23:12] injured in the right here
[2:23:17] [Applause]
[2:23:20] if you notice Marcus was the servant the
[2:23:24] servant to who high priest the servant
[2:23:27] to the high
[2:23:28] priest amen who is the high
[2:23:33] priest brother the Bible says in verse
[2:23:36] 13 and they led him to
[2:23:38] who Ana first for he was the
[2:23:41] father-in-law to who which was the what
[2:23:45] high priest that in that same what
[2:23:48] brother Bram say kaas
[2:23:51] he could not see it he was a
[2:23:55] what he was a what a pop of
[2:24:04] what are we together are we together so
[2:24:08] Marcus was a
[2:24:11] servant of the
[2:24:16] pop in other word he would do job for
[2:24:19] the pop
[2:24:21] and if you notice before Donald Trump
[2:24:25] passed he met with the Catholic
[2:24:29] [Applause]
[2:24:32] church and the Catholic Church gave him
[2:24:35] his approval because the Catholic are
[2:24:37] already in the cabinet now he's a
[2:24:41] servant to the Catholic
[2:24:45] church that's why he received an injury
[2:24:48] to the right here is a son that this
[2:24:52] world is about to be crucified but thank
[2:24:55] God he was the third
[2:24:58] [Applause]
[2:25:02] pool remember Jesus said father you
[2:25:05] already glorify me but glorify me again
[2:25:09] it is the time of
[2:25:15] glorification that's why brother say
[2:25:18] when you see the squeeze begin to want
[2:25:20] to come watch the turn to and how do I
[2:25:24] know the squeeze is coming look at the
[2:25:27] inury to the right
[2:25:29] [Applause]
[2:25:33] here somebody's going to serve the pop
[2:25:37] because the Catholic is in the cabinet
[2:25:40] but thank God if you notice Jesus was
[2:25:43] the one that healed the injury
[2:25:47] [Applause]
[2:25:55] it is God that save
[2:25:58] [Applause]
[2:26:05] Trump follow me carefully are we
[2:26:09] together are we together are we together
[2:26:12] the entire Ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:26:15] Jesus Christ was make was doing miracle
[2:26:19] as a sinless god
[2:26:21] am
[2:26:24] Hall Jesus when he was born no
[2:26:28] sin amen Jesus said who can convince me
[2:26:32] of sin the entire Ministry of Jesus
[2:26:35] Christ he was a god without sin doing
[2:26:39] miracle but on the garden of
[2:26:43] Gest follow me carefully the pillar of
[2:26:46] fire left Jesus Christ because Jesus
[2:26:49] Took the up and accepted the sin he
[2:26:53] became a god with sin just like you God
[2:26:58] with
[2:27:01] [Applause]
[2:27:05] sin now the miracle of Marcus it was a
[2:27:09] miracle done by a God who was a sinner
[2:27:13] so it is the time of you who are sin to
[2:27:17] be God
[2:27:19] [Applause]
[2:27:27] the work that I do you going to do it
[2:27:31] and you going to do
[2:27:32] how Jesus Christ was by was baptizing
[2:27:37] people the Bible say Jesus baptized the
[2:27:40] people with the disciple by the disciple
[2:27:44] but when Jesus became a sinner he sent
[2:27:47] somebody to heaven without wor about
[2:27:50] [Applause]

[2:28:21] cross that you need to get baptized he
[2:28:25] said you know what today with me that's
