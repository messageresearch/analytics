========================================

you just have your way lord have your way in this service we love you and thank you for everything that you do in jesus name amen oh he has forgiven me and my sins have been washed from his memory by the blood the lamb of calvary he [Laughter] has forgiven me and i'm forgiven because you were forsaken oh i'm accepted you were condemned oh i'm alive and well your spirit is within me [Music] because you died and rose again amen [Music] amazing love how can it be that you my king would die for me love i know it's true and it's my joy to honor you [Applause] amen i'm [Music] i'm forgiven because you were forsaken and i'm accepted you were condemned oh i'm alive and well your spirit is within me because you died [Music] amazing love how can it be that you my king would die for me amazing love i know true and it's my joy to honor you in all honor you one more time amazing love we sing amazing love how can it be that you my king you my king would die for me true it's my joy it's my joy to honor you in all i do one more time and [Music] david can we get this monitor turned down a little bit [Music] same key qc no one knew how alone i was feeling and the emptiness i tried so hard to hide [Music] and though i laughed and said my life was fine without you i was covering up the secrets here's a quran oh then one day someone told me of mercy and the love you showed on a hill called calvary oh there you die and purchased my redemption when you broke since power and set my spirit free how you care and through your precious blood i found pardon thank you lord oh amazing [Music] let's do that last part again i want you to hear these words oh and my sins are washed and they're all washed away all masses are washed oh and yes it's true there been days when i have filled you lord you know the many times i've gone astray oh but i've learned your love is stronger than my witness thank you lord no one else has ever cared for me like you lord and other friends could never be as close to me or church i'm not oh i'm amazed that you love me church i'm amazed how you care [Music] are amen amen church this song is special to me i was born and raised in this message from a from a little child i was born and raised but i never knew god personally i never met him for myself and when we hear our pastor talk about what he's been teaching about when if you don't know god before your teenage years then satan really the door opens for satan to really get a hold of you and to think that i was born and raised in this message and a lot of parents and a lot of ministers and a lot of pastors will think that that's enough for a child but yet still when i reached those teenage years i didn't know god for myself and i struggled and i struggled and satan started to get a hold of my life and this song didn't become real to me until i met god personally i could have sang this song all through my kid years all the way up to 10 13 15 but it meant a whole lot more to me when i was 20 because i realized that all my sins are washed away and i'm chosen i'm amazed that he loves me he could have loved so many other people he could have chose so many people more qualified but you look through the bible you look through time he always chose the sinners he went to the gutter and reached down and pulled you out he didn't chose he didn't choose the pharisees or the sadducees they might have known the bible from front to back and those weren't the ones he chose he chose the sinners because he can get glory out of the redemption of that sinner in church he chose us he chose us to be part of this bride for this age because he had confidence in us and like i said this song after the age of after my teenage years when god really got a hold of me this song became new to me this song became precious to me and we're just gonna do it one more time just the chorus one more time [Music] oh and my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away one more time think of those words and my sins last time all my sins oh my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are rushed away thank you lord amen thank you lord thank you lord [Applause] i didn't receive no prayer requests this evening i don't know if someone some someone has something on their heart that they want to ask prayer for this evening brother greg amen we'll go ahead and take your testimony uh last weekend we took a long weekend's wife and i and my granddaughter and we left friday of course we we prayed before we left and we left friday went to charleston to see my stepson and from there we went we were going to beaufort spend the weekend when we left charleston going to beaufort on 26th there traffic was heavy it was they were probably going 80 90 miles an hour you know how people drive and my wife was driving and my granddaughter was right behind her and i was of course in the passenger seat and this truck came up on her on the right side and he was flying and uh he cut right in front of us how he missed us i have no idea but my wife told me now i didn't see this now she said she saw the rear of his trailer pass right through the front of the car and and that that had to be because how he i don't i have no idea how he missed us and if he would have hit us it would have swung that car around into oncoming traffic and it would have hit my wife and my granddaughter um and i just think that when the lord does something like that for us we need to we need to make it known you know and uh as i told her i said that's why when we go on a trip anywhere with the crazies on the road you just never know and i just i just wanted to thank the lord for that that he brought us back home safely thank you and then you know a car can get about that close to you without hitting you because that's that's about the width of an angel's wing so they can come that close but god's angels are protecting us and and uh you know if it's not meant for you to have that accident then something will just part the part the cars brother kelly did you have something amen amen [Applause] god bless you you know i was sitting there and i tell you the songs were definitely appropriate um have a testimony saints we um i guess last night i was supposed to go there to walmart i thought i was supposed to go and take back a return but i didn't go last night i waited uh until the lord told me to go he said to that so i told the wife i said well i'll just wait until tomorrow so when i went there today it was at a walmart in mooresville and it was uh i won't say the organization but they always asking for money paying for money and i said i wouldn't give him a brown penny so we got around there right and i came back and i came out of walmart and i was getting ready to go into walmart and one of the gentlemen that was with the organization he said hey you want to give to the organization so i turned and i looked at him i said come here for a minute come here so i said now tell me about this organization so when he told me about the about the organization i said do you all have bible study there and we said yeah we read our bible in the morning every morning for now i said okay i said now but you don't look like you should be out here like this and he was older gentlemen about 63 and a man who was actually from augusta georgia so i was telling them we stayed there for about nine years and then all of a sudden i asked him i said okay um tell me about your salvation since you all have bible study he said what do you mean i said see that's why god sent you out here and that's why i'm here i said first you have to understand now you're having bible study and and i won't tell you about the scheme of the organization later on if you come to me privately i won't say it out like this but anyway i've seen them for years and i was telling them this is the first time i ever talked to anyone in this organization and he was telling me actually what they were doing and i talked to the gentleman i said you know i said well what are you really looking for he said you see my shoes he said look on the bottom of these shoes he said these shoes cost me a hundred and some dollars and he said you see he said i don't need no money i'm trying to get my salvation and get delivered from drugs he said that's the reason why i'm i'm really out here and i said you know what i believe god put us together nothing and not only he gave me his phone number him his name he gave me his home address he said you gonna be my mentor from here on out call me every day and we'll do it when your mind is fed fast oh christ i'm telling you the lord has set you free huh the lord has set you free and he was looking for them so it wasn't on me out of my mind and step fast on christ and the other testimony i got brother abel brother stephen the lord gave brother steve that message there about prophecy remembering the purple garments about them about the purple garments well i won't say where but we were in a meeting and that same question came up and when that question came up no one said anything about it so i was then the brother that was leaving it i said lord no i'm not going to answer it he came there and he took one word and he wouldn't answer it but the brother knew what he was saying i knew it was god because the same thing he was saying the lord i gave it to brother steve so i didn't say anything and i waited i didn't say anything so i waited until later on that night and the lord put the brother on my heart again and i called the brother i said brother what the lord has told you was the same thing the holy spirit gave our pastor i said i'm telling you i'll stand on what he gave him and you stand on because what you asked about that parable what that that that prophecy that was being fulfilled no one else would touch it but that one brother and i said we're leaving it alone and when i got with him privately i'm telling you just open his spirit wide out he just kept saying thank you thank you and thank you so i tell you things what you're getting here don't be ashamed to go out and tell god bless you brother thank you

blessings we greet you all tonight in the name of jesus christ surprise or maybe not surprised but you got me tonight amen if you don't mind thank you musician for everything but evil continue to climb higher and higher every day amen who really enjoy the song service and the musician if you would let's go to genesis chapter 12. we're going to pick up where we left off on sunday i hope everybody here over the majority of you already listen to the sermon on sunday right amen can i see your hands how many listen to the sermon on sunday okay blessed be the name of the lord if you're behind make sure you catch up amen because we are looking at the friendship and that opening between ahola and the assyrian amen you know a brother called me today we were fellowshipping just want to know how i was doing when he mentioned something to me he said i'm still listening to the old sermon about the third heaven the tree heaven and i told him i said probably we're going to start that sermon back over at zero and continue to climb back up and uh we finish our testimony our conversation and for the majority of the time what i preach here is already laying on the computer so i have sermons in that computer that are not preached yet so if you come and i pull one i begin to preach you think i was sitting with you or i was listening to your conversation somewhere they already laying back there amen then when i was sitting there there is something about that sermon we have not even touched that yet it's still on the computer that came back to me that needed to be incorporated tonight i said okay now i understand why the brother mentioned that he didn't even know why he told me that there is something in that sermon it's in the mystery of the tree heaven i have not even explained that yet so just stay tight because i'm gonna dig into that and come out amen but you stay alive amen let's go to genesis chapter 12. if you dare you can say amen let me see my time oh my god sandy head to rush with a different speed amen go back to genesis chapter 11 verse 31. i just want to grade something there so you get a background everybody there and terror took abram his son and lot the son of heron his son son in other words lot to abraham was a nephew anybody clear and sarai his daughter-in-law his son abraham's wife and they went forth with them from er of the cardins to go into the land of canaan and they came to heron and do out there you might be seated so right here we can see that abraham left the city of ur of the counties because the assyrian are the caldins everybody clear the assyrian or the counties cardins you're gonna see that so abraham was living in mesopotamia where did you get that in the land of earth of the caldens everybody clear so the lord told abraham to leave and to go to the land of canaan anybody clear so when he left if you look on chapter 11 it looks like they all migrate together but that was not according to the instruction of god because when they left abraham left with his father and with lot so in if you look at chapter 11 it seems like they all journey together but that's not really the case the truth lays in chapter 12. if you dare you can say amen chapter 12 verse 1 now the lord had said if you notice the bible didn't say the lord says it is in the past tense he just dropped right now amen in other words the lord already told abraham so you need to take genesis chapter 12 and pull it back up in chapter 11. you see now if you follow that sequence like that you're going to miss it the bible didn't say the lord said to abraham the lord had said it's in the past the lord had said to abraham get out of your country in other words god wanted abraham to be separated from his country everybody clear and we already preached to you that every country have a spirit do you remember that which is an angel that is called the press the priest of that country from the realm of the principalities in other words god wanted abraham to detach himself from the influence of his own country or the prince of that country that is now in between the line anybody clear get out of your country come on and from your water how can you separate a man from his kindred is god a bad man separate yourself from your kindred what do you want me to do i thought we need to keep relationship you remember on sunday i thought we need to we can separate and be friend you remember sunday okay get out from your kindred and the lord drop again down he came from the country then drop down to it's like a whanau kindred now it's going down to the a very pivotal point now amen and from that when from your father's house how can you separate yourself from your brothers you see now not only the country but the kindred not only the kingdom but even in your family separate brother stephen amen to a land that i will show you and i will make you a great nation and i will bless you and make your name great not where you are all of these promises will happen in the land of canaan it's a package that belongs to canaan that package unfolds only when you obey god and get into canaan anybody clear and you shall be a blessing not only am i gonna bless you but you yourself become a blessing hallelujah and i will bless them god bless you look at that covenant do you want to stay in your family again brother random say i realized i was not the child of eli branham and chosen amen and i will bless them god bless you and curse him that curses you and in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed so abraham departed as the lord has what spoken to him so that departure came by the leadership of god and a lot a nephew remember this is just dropping fresh from heaven lord was a nephew remember this if the lord gave me grace to hit the nephew in the family and lord the nephew went with him and abraham was and five years old when he departed out of what hearing so the lord told him to leave the chardin all the way to the land of canaan if you look it seems like they already did it in chapter 11 then the lord spoke in chapter 12. that's not the case what happened in chapter 12 was the instruction that was supposed to be incorporated in chapter 11. everybody clear so to help you up this is it here act chapter 7 verse 2 and he said man brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appear unto our father who abraham when he was in water this is where your pastor gathered anybody clear when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in water in charon and say unto him get the out of that country and from that kindred and come into the land which i shall showed you then came he out of the land of water now you remember that instruction happened before he left cardinals this is what make you refocus everything back again amen then came here out of the land of the cardins and dwell in sharon and from dance when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell in other words then he left thailand and came into the land of canaan everybody clear but what i want to i want you to keep there is a total separation amen because lord speaking with abraham caused trouble exodus chapter 23. i'm not telling you to forget your families because abraham separated from lord when there was argument that rose but the heart of abraham continue to pray for lot you see what i'm saying so even though you got to take a stand for what god is calling you your heart will still remain to plead for the redemption of your loved one but you're not gonna condone with your loved one to find yourself out of the will of god you understand me okay exodus chapter 23 verse 31 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and i will set your bounds your boundaries from the red sea even to the sea of phillies of the philistine and from the desert to the river and i will deliver the inhabitant of the land into your hand and you shall drive them out before you watch now you shall make no covenant when you go into the promised land kill everything anybody clear make no covenant with them nor with their god they shall not dwell in your land lest they make you do what in other words if you keep some of them alive in canaan you're not going to convert to them do you hear me but they're going to cause you trouble oh we're going to win them we're going to win them we're going to win them you'll find yourself compromising everybody clear they shall not dwell in your land lest they make you sin against me for if you serve their god it will surely be a snare to you a trap to you in other words separate everybody clear because death itself is a separation everybody clear let's go to exodus 34. amen there are some territory we need to get on sunday and it's going to be you pray for me exodus 34 if you dare say amen verse 10 and he said be lo behold i make a covenant before all your people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which you are you are shall see the work of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with you observe you that which i commend you this day behold i will drive out before you the amorite everybody clear and the canaanite and the high hat and the parasite and the high fat and the jebusite verse 12 take heed to yourself lest you make a water a covenant again a covenant with the inhabitant of water so when you get into the promised land make no covenant with those people with the inhabitant of the land where you go lest it be for a snare in the midst of what you god continue to repeat this i'm taking you out of egypt i'm pulling you from the world i'm pulling you out of denomination i'm pulling you into a different land when you get there make sure you check who you get in friendship with let's go to detroit chapter seven i wish all the parents were here tonight and if you are not here tonight you are following make sure your child listen to this amen because you start from the parent i wish everybody was here but i had to deliver this tonight deuteronomy chapter 7 if you dare you can say amen you need to keep your bible when the lord your god shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it and has cast out many nations before you the high that the gergeshard and the amorite and the canaanite and the parasite and the ivar and the jebusite seven nation greater and mightier than you almost like seven one two three four seven and when the lord your god shall deliver them before you you shall do water you shall smite them and utterly destroy them you shall make know what he keep repeating that no covenant with them no show what mercy to them even if it's a baby that baby will grow up and cause you trouble one day everybody here show no mercy anybody clear neither shall you make water in other words no marriages between the people that don't between you and the people that don't believe like you i wish i wish the whole church was here hallelujah neither shall you make marriages with them your daughter you shall not give to his son nor his daughter shall you take to your son why i thought they can convert to them i thought they can preach them to them the god of israel and bring them to the commonwealth of israel verse 4 for they will do what in other words there is power in that nation that can turn you away from the god of israel amen to the caliber of solomon with all the wisdom of god when solomon went against this commandment despite the gift of discernment solomon was turned against god churchill it's a tight corner but we gotta cut it out amen for they will turn away your son from following me that they may serve either god that's exactly what happened to solomon so will the anger of the lord be kinded against them god will not get angry about them he will get angry about you you see now against you and destroy who how do you see how you can put yourself in trouble by your marriages by your friendship by your alliances and i'm gonna show you even in the business you can get in trouble you join with somebody and you get in trouble i'm going to show you all of that let's go to deuteronomy 22 and we're going to pray blessed be the name of the lord lord have mercy on this time hallelujah deuteronomy 22 verse 9 if you dare you can say amen you shall not saw your vineyard with water so when you have a vineyard god doesn't want you to be mixing stuff you see deliver all the way to the vineyard skip the vineyard separated you shall not sow your vineyard with diverse seeds lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown and the fruit of your vineyard be water when you are mixing your vineyard what you are even intending to receive will be destroyed that mixing relationship will cause you trouble not to them they are already in darkness you the loser they are not losing anything they are actually gaining you to their kingdom and you are the one losing and god turn and whoop you let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you are doing for us lord thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the reveal word of the hour father we are committing this service unto the hand be the alpha and the omega father moved me completely out of the way and made the holy spirit seal everything everybody in this building lord and may the devil be the one sealed down father may you touch those that are streaming tonight lord and may you come and minister to us in a powerful way lord father as we commit it and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we are dealing with part 22 preparing ourselves to the second banquet let's go to ezekiel chapter 23 that's where we were on sunday if you're there then you can say amen everybody clear now verse 3 and they committed whoredom in egypt we already explained to you they were in egypt and they left egypt and they came to the promised land but something happened in egypt that they got a mark somewhere of unbelief we are in ezekiel 23 verse 3. they commit wardom in egypt they commit warden in the we find on sunday that egypt can be the world or egypt can be a church and god is pulling you out of denomination or some of us god pulled us out of the world everybody clear and they committed well done in their youth this is specifically pointing that age of the teenager there where the breast pressed it's talking about the teenager age and there they bruised the teeth of their virginity on sunday we showed you the importance of virginity everybody clear and the name of them were ahola the elder and a holy by her sister and they were mine god claims them beside despite everything that happened in their life and they're both sons and daughters that's where they named samaria a city a woman is a hola and jerusalem a aholiba verse five and ahola played the harlot when she was mine and she dotted or lasted on her lovers on the assyrian her neighbor ever clear so this woman forgot the weakness that she had the dog that she already opened with a serpent seed and continued to play by mixing herself into a wrong relationship everybody clear drop down to verse 15 so you understand guarded with girdle everybody clear upon their lungs exceeding in thy attire upon their heads all of them priests to look to in other words handsome people after the manner of water the babylonian of water which is the city that god told abraham to depart from them the very foundation of israel started with abraham the faith of abraham and god separated abraham from the land of the cardinals because abraham himself was an idolater over there and when god took him away israel ended up in egypt and god took them out of egypt and they forgot and they forgot the foundation of their apostolic father the original faith of the pentecost that start with abraham and they went again and messed back again with the land that god told them not to mess up anybody clear let's go back to verse five and ahola played the harlot when she was mine and she lasted or daunted on her lovers the assyria and her neighbor if you notice here the assyrian are not far away the assyrian are within the vicinity they are neighbors everybody clear and we wear this coat on sunday brother branham say usually if a man is going to be a believer he's got to do what to separate himself from water his worldly friend it's going to cost you your friendship if you want to work with god it costs abraham his country it costs abraham his kindred and it costs abraham even his family member hallelujah all the water everybody yoke yourself up from among the unbelievers they shall only call you back into the water so when you decide yourself to follow the god of israel your friend that you have in the world the devil will anoint them in order to use them to pull you back again from slavery everybody why environment has a lot to do with it did you know that your what environment sure did i'm gonna drop down here it is the environment that counts and when you are a christian when you are redeemed from egypt you are in the promised land when the lord pulled you out of denomination when the lord pulled you out of cadence when the lord went to egypt despite everything that happened to this sister a holla when god take you out of egypt and put you down to the promised land you must watch who you are associating yourself with because the devil used their navel to bring again a trouble to this woman you already have trouble when you were youthful and now the lord is coming the second time to rescue you and you still don't understand the door that you opened when you were youthful anybody clear it is the environment that counts and when you are a christian you associate with who christian and go with who christian and be a water you got to have the right kind of environment around you if you get out in the pool room and dancehall and shuntings and shardings and everything else and you call yourself a christian the first thing you know you shall be believing it's all right to do what so the more you associate yourself with an environment leader by leader the devil will call will kill you like a frog do you know how they boil a frog they turn the temperature leader by leader and the frog have a tendency to adjust himself to the temperature until he finds himself pulled away everybody clear so far praise the name of the lord the bible says in embassy three this is where we stop on sunday can two walk together except they be water if you want to work with somebody you must find a common ground somewhere everybody christian with christian i know we try to hang out to our relationship we tried to hang up with an old friend trying to be friend respect one another but the bible clearly stated that when you temper with those doors they have the power to pull you away hallelujah can two work together accept the be what in other words if you don't agree in certain principle you must separate okay no problem proverbs 22 verse 24 and 25 make no what make no friendship with what with an angry man and with a furious man you shall not work if somebody have a bad behavior you need to watch whether you're going to work together with that person or not amen the bible doesn't say you're going to convert him you over estimate yourself sometime and you don't understand the devil to overcome you must understand the devil in his taxi if you want to beat the devil down pull the devil into your ground when the devil gets into your ground that's it if he pull you in his ground then it's a different story every time i speak to somebody who's not a message believer what i usually do is bring them to the bible when they say something i say no let's go to the bible if you can show me this in the bible then we can talk i don't want you to talk about your bishop or your pastor i just want you to show me the bible because i know very clear that if they put their feet in the bible the message of the hour have made the bible a new book the bible is our land because the message opened the bible once you put your feet on the bible then you are doomed because the bible is my territory i am not the author of the book and i know how to handle you hallelujah but don't argue with reasoning that's not your ground hallelujah make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man that shall not what lest you do what how are you gonna learn it's not that that man will sit down with you and say sit down today lesson number one how to be angry tomorrow lesson number three how to get really mad that's not the way it works everybody here by just you being in that environment you are automatically receiving the influence of that anointing and before yourself before you before you know it you're going to find yourself getting angry at home let that learn his way and get a snail to your water so not only is he a problem to your own life but it's a problem to your own soul you are putting your salvation in trouble because of your friendship you are giving more value to your friendship above your standard with christ that's why you see people taking certain decision in life because of their friendship they rather keep the friendship and then lower the standard with god there is no an unbeliever don't compromise with you anybody clear they don't come from us to keep you everybody clear you are the one that's gonna make some effort when they are around you you're gonna find a different talk to talk with them so that they are not uncomfortable you are doing that to preserve them but when they want to smoke even in your presence they're going to pull the cigarette and put the cigarette in the mouth and light it up and sometimes they can turn against you and go ever clear hallelujah first corinthians chapter six hebrew second corinthians chapter six thank you be not an equally yoked together with who that was the old testament this is the new testament anybody clear for what i'm reading your bible if you want you can open it so you can see it yourself i don't want the devil play with you like maybe your personal manipulated anybody clear for what fellowship have righteousness with what in other words there should not be fellowship between an unrighteous man and a righteous man this road is tough buddy and what god what communion has light with what let me leave this because he just reminded me keep ezekiel 23 go to genesis chapter one he just reminded me and look at this stay alert because this is the tree heaven he just said it so i'm going to go through it everybody clear go to verse six and god say let there be film a man in the midst of water follow me very careful when the world was created we know the world was like this then the world was void without form darkness upon the face of the deep and the world was filled with water i already explained the mystery how we got to the water when the the first thing that was created was the sun and then out of the sun came a kink in in other words a portion was broken from the sun and begin to run away from the sun anybody following me as that portion begin to run away from the sun the temperature begin to cool off anybody following me when the temperature begin to cool off if you ever wore glasses like me if they put the air conditioning here and you go outside and it's 80 degrees what happened to your glasses the fog that fog is water anybody following me so the changing of temperature from the sun automatically away from the sun created moisture as it created moisture that moisture began to get in the cool zone then it became ice that's why brother branham said the world was a ball of ice you won't forget you understand me then brother branham said the pillar of fire went and pick up the earth and begin to push it back again toward the sun and as they move it toward the sun the eyes begin to melt and that's what filled the earth with water that one you need malachi 4. anybody clear so when they created the earth when everything happened the earth was filled with water everybody killed you now go back to verse 6. and god say let there be a firmament in the midst of water so in this water here god wanted to put a firm man on a heaven for those who remember when i was ministering you can remember this god wanted to divide the what the water he want to put a heaven between the water anybody following me thank you and let it divide the water from the water you are dividing water from the water how can you divide water from the water how god took this water and changed the earth into this situation he put the firmament which is the heaven that you see there and then on top of it water and below it water you following me god divided water from water hallelujah job two verse seven and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the water so here under you have water you follow me now then above also you have water that is under the firmament from the water which is what above the filament and it was so so now the water that used to be one part became split into two parts anybody clear verse eight and god called the firmament water and the evening and the morning were the second day watch now and god say let the water wear under the heaven be gathered together into what one place and let the dry land appear so god took this water here everybody following me your female man is still here water on top of it god took this water here and put everything in one side everybody here and this one become the dry ground genesis clear where are you going let the water under the heaven be gathered together to one place let the dry land appear and it was so watch verse 10 now you ready now and god called the joy land what this is what is your earth you see how we need to be reprogrammed everybody here call earth and the gathering together of the water called he water oh so the water that were left under the firmament were called what you follow me sees and god saw that he was what now it seems like god is separating water from water and he put a limit a boundary and the boundary is the filament which is the heaven and one part of the water is called heaven over there and the other part is called faith let's go to revelation chapter 17. keep your ezekiel let's go to revelation chapter 17. if you dare you can say amen revelation chapter 17. this is a chunk from the history of three heaven revelation chapter 17 you're there everybody there verse one and there came one of the seven ninja we know him which had the seventh vowel we know him malachi 4 brother brother and talk with me if you don't remember this go back to the tape go back on youtube saying to me come here i will show you the judgment of the great what prostitute that sits upon many what now we found a prostitute here baby london babylon of the calden you follow me now do you follow me babylon of the cardin do you follow me babylon a woman babylon the great is seated upon the what waters relax upon the waters jump to verse 15. you ready can you see that and he says to me the waters which you sow where the walls sit are what you okay now so when god was separating water from water you follow me now you follow me now god is separating abraham from his kingdom he's separating people from people you follow me now you follow me now hallelujah our people and what motivated and what and what so water means people everybody clear they are filled with people but god separates people from people you follow me now and he put a boundary between people and people you follow me now then the people under the heaven under the freeman he called them what hallelujah go to revelation chapter 13. let me ask you a question if you don't know this then i need to sit with you when the maddie and jack came down he put his right foot away and the left foot were the foot of the mighty angel was here you follow me and he put another footwear do you understand from genesis your seventh seal was locked ready the land and the sea when the marines come in revelation 10 the land and the sea his feet are not upon the water that are there because the rainbow is over you okay did i lose anybody are we okay let's go to revelation 13. i kept this for the mystery of tree heaven but you're getting a chunk you there verse one and i stood upon the sand of the world the sand of water and i saw a beast rise up out of the water do you see that that beast of revelation 17 that was sitting upon many waters was rising up from there and if you look at the second beast was rising out of the earth that's why the marie angelia put their foot on the sea and put the foot on the earth blocking the two beasts you are following me are we okay go to revelation 22 and i'm going to go back again we're trying to make you a point even from genesis from the beginning god separated light from darkness god separated the people from the people god separated the water from the water take revelation 22 hallelujah go to 21 actually you there revelation 21 everybody there few people everybody there let's go first one and i saw the new water and the new water so in the new after redemption is done there is a new heaven brother robert got it and there is a new what hallelujah are you following me for the first one heaven and the first water the first heaven you see me here and the first one something is left here you okay the first heaven and the first earth was what they all will be removed and there was no more word are you okay when it comes to the redemption the people that are staying here won't be part of the new jerusalem the people that are here are the one that has been separated from god here but these appear will not enter in the new heaven in the new government in the new kingdom these people will be taken out hallelujah job to verse 27. watch now the city verse 27. you there and they shall in no wise enter into it anything that does what that was in the sea come on neither was what neither whatsoever works what the part of the sea or make what but they which are written in the lamb's book of water so god from the beginning separate the people from the people the other people will be bound to the gravitational force of the earth but there are people a water here that have a power to rise above the gravitation there is something in that water that can take you up everybody there until gravity loses it falls and that water man can stay over there and doesn't drop down because it's seated in heavenly places in are you there there is no gravitational force that can pull this water down if you take the airplane you move up you're going to see cloud there they are in cloudy form no more liquid your cloud hallelujah let's go back now onto together with unbelievers for what fellowship had righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have life with light with darkness and what what had christ with who or what part has he that believes with a what so there is no ground for you to have a relationship with an unbeliever not ground by the scripture anybody follow me and what agreement had the temple of who who is the temple of god what agreement had the temple of god with adults for years the temple of the living god that temple is not the one in jerusalem in other words there is no agreement between you and the people that smoke thought and god said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be there and they shall be ma because there is a relationship everybody wherefore do what abraham from among them and be ye what separate said the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will do what if you touch the unclean thing god will not receive you and i will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughter say the lord almighty everybody clear so far take ephesians chapter five hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord everybody clear ephesians 5 if you dare you can say amen verse 1 be you therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also has loved us and has given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling several birth fornication and all uncleanness or consciousness let it be not let it not be one's name among you as becoming what so they cannot we cannot be in this church talking about fornication we cannot be in this church talking about young people having sexual relationship before marriage we cannot give we it's a conversation that cannot be even heard that's why i say i wish it was all the church here amen ever here verse 4 neither what filthiness no foolish what hallelujah this is going to kill a lot of folks no foolish talking no jesting which are not convenient but rather giving what we that's what we need to hear among us first of all for this you know that no war monger no unclean person they are part of the sea remember non-clean person no covetous man who is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and who that's why they are removing the new earth everybody clear be not you therefore what do you know what that means partaker with who you cannot be partnered with anybody that falls under that qualification because god already separated you from before the foundation of the world you understand verse eight for you were what sometimes darkness you were part of the world you did those bad things but once i redeem you you cannot have any more dealings with them ahola forgot about it ahola came back and began to temper with the assyrian the daughter of jacob went out to see the daughter of the city anybody clear but now you enlighten the lord walk as children of what how can you walk in darkness how can you be going around with a friend and your friend looks like a prostitute and you have a long dress and people look at you one light one darkness so somebody is compromising but they are not compromised you are the one compromising for the fruit of the spirit is enough goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable to the lord everybody clear verse 11 and have no water with the unfruitful work of water no fellowship my friend it's better for you to remain alone without friends than try to find friends and find yourself in hell what a friend we have in jesus name what a friend we have in jesus name that's your friend that's the one that needs to put a mark in your life because you're gonna remember his love forever there is no height no death no principality nothing will separate me from the word from the love of god yes my brother praise god amen everybody clear so far nothing shall separate me thank you my brother from the love of god ever here verse 11 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful work of darkness but rather do what we prove expose them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of who who are the them the adult nature the warmonger the world there are certain things that happen in this world that we cannot even have a word to speak between us to describe them so how can you have fellowship everybody clear that are done of them in secret everybody clear but all things are reproved are made manifest by their life for whatever does make manifest is the what wherefore he says awake you that sleep and arouse from among the water you were sleeping because you were a child of god only christians sleep ever clear the other people died when jesus was talking about lazarus he said lazarus sleep those that sleep in christ and you that are sleeping awake from among them move away from the dead people move away from those that are under the sea everybody clear awake you that sleep and arise from the dead and christ shall do what give you life see then that you walk through comes perfectly very careful not as full but as what everybody clears so far praise the name of the lord first corinthians chapter five we were talking about the unbeliever they are outside there is no part no fellowship between you and the unbeliever now let's go inside the church everybody here first corinthians chapter five if you want you can open young people verse nine i wrote up to you in an epistle not to do water not to company with water you cannot have fellowship with anybody that is doing this this is a problem with young people we meet in the restaurant or we just gonna have fellowship you know that person is running around with women he become a woman chaser there is no way you can fellowship together but we've seen all over the years the young people trying to keep up we're just fellowshipping with them we just keep a fellowship we're going to meet ourselves in a restaurant and just have some time what are you going to have some time they don't want you to talk to them about what they're doing what grant what are you agreeing yet not all together with the fornicator of water paul says what i'm talking about fornicator i'm not talking about the fornicator of the world i am talking about the fornicator in the church follow me carefully yet not all together with the fornicator of this world or with the coverage or coverages or extortioner or with idolater for them must he need to do what in other words you left the world you came into christ i am warning you not to be a companion with somebody who's having sexual relationship outside of marriage do you follow me what i'm telling you i'm not pointing you to people outside because if it's people outside it means that you left the church and you went back into the world that's why but i'm not talking about those that are outside if that's the case you must go into the world but you are not in the word you are in the church but i'm talking to you of a people in the church that does it watch again verse 11 but now i have written unto you not to keep water company if any man that is called a water so now this is not the unbeliever in second corinthians no fellowship with the unbeliever but in first corinthians i'm not talking about the unbeliever because if i talk to you again about the unbeliever that means you left the church and you went outside i'm talking to you about people in the church that you call brother but they are not living right abraham separate from yourself from your country from your kindred outside of the church but from the father house within the church everybody call brother be a what fornicator or coverages or idolaters or a railroad or a drunkard or extortioner with such one not not to water don't go in the restaurant with them i'm reading to you the bible i'm reading the bible see what a mess we were doing you know somebody's living unclean and you keep hanging around it's just a friend we're gonna have some time we're gonna sit in a restaurant we're gonna talk the bible said do not eat with them i'm giving you the scripture a holla got in trouble with a neighbor sometimes it's not a neighbor far off it might be a neighbor riding a church and i'm going to show you even a neighbor in your in your biological family ever here first corinthians 15 33 be not receive evil communication corrupt what this is that's half the lord the bible didn't say good manners will influence evil communication in other words evil company will influence you it will destroy you jude 1 22-23 and of some have compassion making a difference and others safe with what in other words when you try to pull him you are going like this if you not experience yet don't do it call a sick call a deacon call a minister who's well seasoned in the world call a pastor somebody who knows how to get the fire without getting burned are we trying to reach out do you have what you need to encounter do you have the power that you need to withstand what you're going to counteract if you know that experience leave it alone talk to the deacon look out for an elder sister that is spiritual you say sister so and so there is a trouble there would you help that sister the sister knows she's gonna probably say leave it alone let's pray first but you are quick let's go help him did you pray but the season sister will say let's keep it in prayer first because she knows that the power of prayer can over can already be breaking those channels then when they talk they know how to restore them that are fallen and others save with fear pulling them out of fire heading even the water spotted by what in other words even clothes don't touch it this is in the new testament in the new testament don't even touch their clothes hallelujah so one time jehoshaphat which was the son of a righteous man and the righteous man himself he came down to see who was there what was ahab he then he was an

brother branham said now i went and got dictionary today from everywhere to look up this word what the word what sodomy it means to be what to be what to be crafty and be in the best interpretation of the hebrew from maha means having a true knowledge of the water it's those kids that know more about sexual things more than their age your friend knows more about women than you when they talk to you you are blind they know the anatomy of women they watch pornography they know everything they can even teach you that things that your mother cannot even talk to you that's that friend that was the friend of ammon in the family the serpent that's why the serpent being sadder could teach eve sex brother branham say that eve wanted to know more about it and they therefore unfold him like you don't

sister temer come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her end and so ammon lay down and made himself what who gave the plane the strategy david on nephew destroying david her own sister even in a family even in your family you must put a line if my brother their home is not living with christ my kids don't go there if something happened it's too late all we gonna say is i'm sorry and you have been taken advantage by a cousin boys get to your home don't go to the room don't go to the girls room stay in the living room who gave you the authority you

come to see him everyone said to the king i pray you let thomas assist him or my sister came and make me a couple of cake in my sight that i may eat at her hand then david sent home to tamar saying go now to your brother ammon's house and dress him meat before he destroyed david daughter where did he get the permission where did he get the permission parent delinquents then david sent home to tamar to jump to verse eight so tema went to her brother emma's house and he was laid down and she took flour and kneaded and made cake in his side and did bake the cake and she took a pen and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and ammon say have out what all men for me and they went out to every man for what why did he chase everybody outside we were five young people all of you go out i need to stay alone with her why do you stay in a room alone with a boy why do you stay in a place alone with a girl why do you stay alone in a car do you see do you see they can put him in jail but whatever he does to you will remain as a scar to your brain i'm going to finish and almond said to them bring me the meat into the what now it's no more in the living room pulling into the chamber do you see the sequence that let me this drop from it just jump right now john adab never gave him that sequence he only told him how to lie and have permission the remaining is automatic he's already under the anointing they don't teach him anymore he begins the black dog is wide awake and and wedging the black dog is saying now next is this now next is this now next is this and ammon said to them bring me the meat into the chamber that i may eat off your hand and tema took the cake innocent which she had made and brought them into the chamber to aim on her brother and when he had brought them to him to eat he took a hold of her and he said come lie with me my sister and she answered him name my brother do not what now it's a matter of force are you strong enough sister are you strong enough this is a strength from the devil like legion are you there no for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not this what falling with the daughter of jacob and i where shall i cause my shame to go and as for you you shall be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray you speak to what for i will he so for he will not reform me from what stop here if you want a relationship with me let's go back to normal go back and talk to my daddy not like this i'm not a prostitute i'm not cheap you don't treat me like this you want to talk to me you go first to my parents are you there however he will not harken there to her voice but being what watch your bible being what stronger hatred where we hated was greater than the law of wherewith he had loved her and ammon said to her eras be gone [Music] let's stand that relationship that boyfriend you want to cater just want to take advantage of you the day he's going to get what he want he have nothing to do with you anymore everybody clear they don't need you anymore you can go be gone you're going to waste two years in a relationship and later on cut off but you're going to be living with memories you're going to be in a relationship five years and cut off you're going to live with memories you're going to leave a relationship 10 years cut off you're going to live with memories you thought they love you they didn't love you they were just there to take advantage of you but the god who is reaching mercy is still there ahola made a mistake she forgot and she went back and began to fellowship with the counties heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy father for giving us an opportunity to minister to your people father i just went a little bit over the time that i should stop lord father not that we want to keep your people here but lord this stuff are so important because the hour that we're living in is so deadly that the devil is there as a roaring lion seeking lord father who to devour he doesn't show any mercy he's not even ashamed anymore he's on television he's in politics he's in religion he's lord father that pale horse that your prophet spoke that it's demonic political and religious power all reams has been gathered together lord against this broad lord father we just unfolded another part of the black dog our relationship lord our friendship lord what we're trying to keep and sometimes most of the time a spirit of stubbornness goes with this because we think we can venture ourself with our personal fable we think that we're strong we can handle we can do things before you know it we found ourself in a wreck we found ourself losing we found ourselves in difficult situations like jehoshaphat but lord you showed us that no matter where we committed error lord father your grace has been there and there is no way you can bring a message such as that this lord is just only you showing your children that it's time to take a stand for your word lord i'm committing this church unto the hand and those that have been streaming lord father may you give grace and may you give a specific anointing lord to this church to the families to the father to the young people lord may you open their eyes lord father in a supernatural way so that they can see the hour that we're living in the danger that we're in lord not lord father to be afraid but to take a stand lord because if they take a stand for you then it's not them fighting the battle is going to be you fighting their battle father may we obey your word and abide in this word lord father may every spirit of stubbornness every spirit that the devil will try to bring to your children to battle their mind against what was preached tonight lord father i rebuke that to the dry places in the name of jesus christ but may this sermon find a bedding ground lord so that your children can be careful on where they're going who do they fellowship with even the adult lord even the parent lord to be watchful of what they're doing lord because somebody is up there trying to take their life off father i commit them unto the hand tonight may you protect each one of us touch those that are sick and afflicted lord give us travel and mercy lord and if that terry to come may we meet again to fellowship again around the revealed word of the hour lord we ask it and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Music] how can you say why i'm so happy [Music] oh i've accepted [Music] the word [Music] have [Music] i'm so happy oh i've accepted [Music] the word of the lord [Music] that was [Laughter] [Music] amen now young people you listen to brother stephen because them friends and worldly friends you might have those relationships you want to keep i can tell you from experience that they may say they respect what you believe they may say that they respect your stand and they won't come in the way of it but they can't help but come in the way of it because that's what they're anointed to do so no matter how much they may respect you and it may not even be their desire to hinder you satan's gonna allow them to hinder you because that's what he placed them there for so be careful with those relationships what he's what he's saying is there's it's true there's a lot of power to it be careful with them relationships y'all are dismissed this evening as we sing this one more time can't you see [Music] why i'm so happy church i've accepted the word [Music] a [Music] so [Music]
