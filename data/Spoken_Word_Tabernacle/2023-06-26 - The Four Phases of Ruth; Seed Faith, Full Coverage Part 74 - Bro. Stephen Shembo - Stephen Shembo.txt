God saying sister in me back there it is the grace of God she was in a hospital being dismissed and she's right there in the morning she even came in question and answer after being dismissed from the hospital that's what we call Soldier amen amen we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience you might be seated a minute as I'm going through my announcement and make sure we got everything squared away here amen any family member here God richly bless you seems like some folks out I don't know where they are I know some are backing up the meeting somewhere but hopefully nobody's sick or something amen is my sound okay sound is good it's not blasting anyone he's always only bless the devil amen glory to God I'm still waiting on the date for the young Brothers meeting before we can schedule the young sister's meeting the Deacon asked if we can give them a chance first before we move on with the sisters so patriarch where you are whether you're at work or here just make sure you give me a date quickly so we can move on Amen our next question and answer will be on July the 22nd how many heard me say can I see your hand next question and answer July the 22nd amen same place if I'm not mistaken brother Kelly right now yes so July the 22nd we had a wonderful one yesterday if you are not there you asked the people that were there but we deal with we dealt with the legging so if you don't know ask the sister or whoever was there they can give you the answer amen I sent the code last night about the children of job you saw the quote right is it clear now so we finished the mystery about the children of job it is clear now you gotta back it up and it's clear praise be to the name of the Lord amen it is the grace of God because this question have been there for years like rather Robert mentioned that amen we have released music part three I believe you saw it already so now you have music part one music part two music part three I believe I dealt more with dancing over there so it is in your hand your blood is not in my hand if you still going on with whatever music you're listening to that's your problem between you and God brother Branham say every church every assembly have three kind of believers can you say Amen make sure you're not among the make-believer and the unbeliever make sure you are among the believer so don't fulfill the make-believer part don't fulfill the unbeliever path make sure you own the believer side but in every Church brother Branham say you'll find those three so make sure whatever you do you find yourself on the good side amen amen glory be to the name of God I spoke to a brother from South Africa brother always Robertson I believe he made a he contacted brother Chad Lamb he was so pleased with the series on the music so he called we spoke together and he wanted me to greet the church so there is a brother and also brother Morton there is a lot of brother um and sisters that are put in comment and sending me messages wherever you are brother God richly bless you we appreciate the encouragement but brother always Robertson want me to greet the church these are people that if they were living in United States probably they will be sitting next by you in other words they are following the sermon one every day even if you miss one they don't miss the sermon so these are our invisible brothers and sisters so he want me to greet the church so brother Robertson you heard me delivering your message and spoken word uh Tabernacle say what you heard them so God richly bless you amen glory be to God how many are reading their Bible every day in the morning and in the evening I don't see some hand so I'm gonna load some coat about what brother Branham say about reading your Bible do you know that brother Brandon said you should read one chapter in the morning and one chapter before you go to bed do you know that do you know that okay I'm gonna load the quote on the good chat about reading your Bible amen you should read one chapter in the morning and one chapter a night the Bible say meditate and it's a scripture how many are reading the Cod book and their Church ages and the seals and the 70 weeks of Daniel in the day of judgment you will see these clips coming up straight reminding you that your pastor was reminding you every day stay put your head in the message of the hour amen and how many are up to date with the sermon Wednesday was a wonderful sermon amen about catching up what is behind the word of a prophet wonderful sermon if you miss it make sure you catch up quickly amen I believe I cover everything let's go to our scripture this morning and we trust the Lord that we will be able to navigate on what we're trying to get there if I can get this we will move correctly we are in the big huge traffic with the revelation of God we have so much that the Lord unfolded now I'm in the traffic so I'm moving five miles an hour amen It's a Wonderful traffic amen give me volume so I'm independent you there let's go to the Book of Joshua chapter one if you want to have a reception in this church listen to music part three so we don't see foolishness in our receptions okay yeah I don't want to see what I see across the message you already got the word and I'm under commission to deliver the message the way it came from the messenger I'm under commission to repeat what brother Branham say not to repeat like a parrot but repeat Under The Same Spirit that brother Branham delivered the message so whether you like it or not I am backing up amen I am backing up I have to deliver the message if you don't please you today maybe five years later you will get the Revelation and you will love me but I am backing up with what I'm seeing Joshua chapter 1 verse one if you dare you can say Amen let's see how I can navigate through this by God's grace if we can push amen hmm yeah we handle that later now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord I'm responsible for what I'm going to say this is me okay if somebody say you say that was brother Stephen after the death of William Marion Branham that's me okay you can be part of it or not but that's me okay that's me I'm responsible if somebody have a problem they need to call me now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord he came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of none Moses minister in other words assistant saying everybody clear you might be seated so a major great big Prophet have passed away amen a prophet that God used powerfully in a mighty way because God spoke he says the way I talk with Moses it is not the way I talk to everybody [Applause] he said when I talk to somebody I have to search certain way to talk but when I'm talking to Moses God said do you know the scripture God say I talked to Moses face to face in other words Moses is like my friend when me and Moses talk there is no filter amen Moses who accomplished great miracle in Egypt that Prophet Moses is dead have Moses left something job 2 verse 7. amen now God is talking to Joshua who is left Moses is gone but there is something that Moses left and that which Moses left is not different than Moses the Bible says that Moses is red every Sabbath it's written in the Bible they didn't take the man Moses in reading it everybody okay they were reading the law of Moses because the messenger and his message are water and the same everybody okay you should be chewing this kind of stuff already so we can move to New meals everybody okay only be you strong and very courageous that you may observe to do according to all the law not some law all the law which who Moses must serve and commanded so Moses left the scene as a man but he left a message everybody okay he left the law and God is instructing the minister that was left that what you wanted to do in your life is to follow the message that Moses left why do you have to stay with everything that Moses left what is in it what is he gonna do to you when you follow Moses to the level from Kiefer to Kevin what will happen to you what do you get out of it what is the benefit of it everybody okay glory to God only be that strong and very courageous that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you watch this turn not from me to the water or to the water in other words you cannot even joke even a slight no you must stay zero in with Moses what he says Amen in other words if somebody come and want to interpret Moses law a different way than the way Moses delivered don't follow it why comma that you made water Prosper wherever you water go with is my papa different than your Bible sir so if you want to prosper what do you have to do follow Moses how do you follow Moses in detail so the law of Moses or the message of Moses amen have a key to prosperity don't worry amen I say Amen you can refuse it job to verse 8 it's a matter of take or leave it but as for me and my house me I take what God has for me if you fall with the blessing of God praise be to the name of God but I know you not verse 18. this book of the Lord this message that Moses left amen shall not depart out of your water now not out of your head what does it mean shall not depart out of your mouth does it mean you take the scroll and put it in your mouth and everywhere you're going you have the scroll they're talking about the mouth the law of Moses or the message of Moses God told Joshua make sure that message is in your mouth not sometime everybody okay any time the law of Moses must be in your mouth in other words if somebody want to know the law of Moses they can just talked to Joshua because the law of Moses is always on the mouth of Joshua so when you talk to Joshua you won't hear politics thank you continue with your politics this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth but you shall do what meditate therein how day and night you meditate sometime how can you meditate day and night in other word all the time constantly you are thinking about the book of Moses when you wake up you start all the way when you go to bed you're still thinking about what Moses said there is a meditation amen how dare not all the time everybody okay that you may observe to water do there is a doing or action amen three things this book of the law shall not depart off your art of your mom so in your mouth the law is there everybody okay when you meditate you meditate upon that law when you do you do that law so we want to see the law of Moses in your mouth in your meditation and in your action everybody okay the law of Moses must be in your mouth it must be in your meditation it must be in your action so when you meditate if God look he must see the law when you're doing things in your life when God look he must see the Lord when you are talking when God heal he must heal the Lord amen why is that that you may observe to do according to all that is written where for then you shall make your way how prosperous and then you shall have water good success so if you if you want to have prosperity and good success amen you need to make sure the message is in your mouth and you meditate upon the message and you do what the message saying amen math we already know what it is but where does the meditation comes from David says this in the book of Psalm verse 19 Chapter 19 Verse 14. let the water words word of water my mouth and the meditation of my water all right everybody okay so when we talk about the math we are talking about the words and when we talk about the meditation we are talking about the heart amen David say let the word of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be how acceptable in this in that sight oh Lord my strengthen my water Redeemer how is your word and your meditation be acceptable the only way you can be acceptable is if you put what God has given you because God and His word are one if you want to please God make sure your mouth has the word of God everybody okay make sure nothing come out of your mouth that will contradict the word of God whatever you talk in your mouth make sure it doesn't go against the message of the hour amen whatever you are thinking and pondering in your heart must be according to the message of the hour amen and whatever you do in your life must be according to the message of Yahweh amazing the message is not for month only but not life Psalm 49 verse 3 my mouth shall speak of water wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of water because out of the abundance of the water all right that's the water so when they're talking about keeping the word in the mouth before the word can get in The Mask he must first stand in the heart is that first in the heart then he goes in the mouth then he become a living action that's right number one number two number three these are the key to your faith everybody okay first it is in the heart amen after the heart you speak it when you speak you act according to what you spoke [Music] that's fun Roman 10 verse 8 but what says there so you can never separate the mouth and the Heart sorry everybody okay everybody okay and Paul continue he said that is the word of water which we which that if you shall do whatever confess with water thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ in the heart that God has raised him to death then that shall be out same so first you must believe in your heart and then you must confess it in your mouth and God Wants You Always to meditate upon his word amen because the more you put his word in his in your heart the more you have something to speak whatever entering will come out if you don't put anything there there is nothing to speak about everybody okay what is this why is this important prosper and have water good success so God wants you to prosper amen amen God wants you to have good success that's right that's why he's giving you the key to prosperity amen amen let's go to mark 11. it's amazing how people are more holy than God we got used to religion amen that's why we suffer it's not because of God it is because of the way we interpreted God the perfect interpretation of God came by the message of the hour you want to understand God do what brother Branham say there it is Mark 11 verse 12. if you dare you can say Amen and on the moral when I will see how I'm gonna go when they were come from Bethany he was hungry you remember this is not a spiritual hunger this is a natural hunger Jesus needed food not food for his heart food for his belly amen he says and seeing a fig tree a far off having lives he came if perhaps happily he must find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but lives for the time of the Fig was not yet you remember that right it was something that was out of season but God wanted to eat so his hunger doesn't look at the season everybody okay he's not sure he's natural need oh desire amen is not based on the season amen so what mother is not this season what mother is if if the desires start if the desires start and it's the season fine if it's not the season fine but if the desires start [Applause] there must be something if a death already started a dip started there must be another deep to respond don't just study like that while you were not worrying about it now you start worrying about it amen amen amen because if Jesus would say that this is not the season I have to wait until the season he will die of hunger everybody okay everybody okay if Jesus say okay let me take an example maybe this was January and the season was December so you want Jesus to wait until December with his hunger verse 14 and Jesus answered and said to him no man eat fruit of you Hereafter forever and his disciple heard it jump to verse 19. and when the evening was come he went out of the city and in the morning brother Kelly give me more here and in the morning as they pass by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots where life hides and Peter calling to remember and say to him Master behold the Fig Tree which you cursed is withered away and Jesus answering say to them have water faith in God so everything that happened happened because of faith we clear right I don't know how long I'm gonna linger in this channel until we pull the fifth out of you I know what I'm about to bring some of you will struggle to swallow it but I will continue to push it [Music] in other words if I push it you throw it away I put it back again you have to follow it because God didn't send you in this church just like that [Applause] [Music] put you under this ministry I will make sure you follow it amen amen amen oh you should be somewhere else but you're gonna swallow it even if you refuse I will push it amen amen verse 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to other this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in the water his heart you remember last Sunday Amen in the heart but Shall Believe remember Paul just say you believe in the Heart Right amen that's where faith lies amen and shall believe that those things which he shall come which he shall which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says you understand this now when you speak you must believe it first amen before you even speak you must believe it first you must accept it first then you can speak amen therefore I say to you what things so ever you water desire do we have any specific desire there I'm sorry whatsoever because time will change era will change technology will change somebody could have asked for a horse today you cannot ask for a horse everybody okay everybody okay so that's why the scriptures say whatsoever you desire depending on what where you are and your time amen amen When you pray believe that you ought to receive the have them for you to have it you must be you believe First that you already receive it then you're gonna have it if you don't believe that you receive it you're not gonna have it we clear let's go to Hebrew one then we pray go Hebrew 11 then we pray glory to God Hallelujah if you dare you can say Amen pages are still turning amen why are you still reading the whole the same scripture over because I can't even get to it now Faith is the water you understand what it means now of fixed water hope for you understand this right the evidence of things water not seen so Faith himself is an Evidence when you have faith you already have it that's fine for E for by it the elders obtain a good report true faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do what in other words whatever we see today with our naked eye didn't start from what from this materials it starts from something that was not visible everybody okay job 2 verse 27. Lord help me if you dare you can say Amen verse 27. is speaking about Moses you there by faith he Moses forsook Egypt he left Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured faith has patience what makes him what made him endure he endured Karma as water a brother as water seeing him seeing him who is water invisible you have not caught it yet let's read it again he endures Karma as water see him who is how invisible how do you see somebody who's invisible I'm reading the Bible they say Moses so someone who is invisible how do you see somebody who is invisible invisible means you cannot see him but Moses saw him how did he see him with eyes [Applause] which eyes did Moses use to see the men because that man is invisible to the natural eye [Music] [Applause] but Paul spoke about the eyes of our understanding Open the Eyes of My Heart hey everybody okay everybody okay so Moses saw him not with natural eyes only faith amen will make you see the invisible amen that's why

money God said prosper we the one thinking about money let's deal with that aspect let's go to Festival foreign let's go to Festival chapter six because when you start touching this subject in the message he's preaching about prosperity and some of you don't come to church because of money [Applause] you chasing after overtime all the time all the time all the time all the time what are you

you looking for Jesus Christ [Applause] let me rock your boat buddy let's go to First Timothy chapter six message believer message believer everybody okay everybody okay let's go to First Timothy chapter six if you dare you can say Amen verse 3 let's rock this thing I'm not talking about rock and roll I'm talking about Rocking the Boat if you and verse 3 you can say Amen watch carefully If any man Teach others and consent not to the whole some words even the words of Our Lord who Jesus so the word of Jesus Christ I will hold somewhere good words healthy word saying the word amen and to the doctrine which is according to water godliness those men are proud watch verse four he is proud knowing water nothing but dodding about water and strife of word well off comes water envy and water and water really and water evil submersing which is like a suspicion perverse disputing of man of corrupt man and destitute of the water true supposing that water is water godliness from such the water withdraw thyself so this is not believers is not talking about believers he's talking first about the people that are perverted that things that again is what another word religion is a way to make money [Applause] I'm going slowly okay it's it's a rocky place so I'm I'm navigating okay job to first now six but godliness with water consent me is a great water [Applause] there is a godliness that has contentment that is what is important let's follow clearly job to verse 7 for we brought water nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry water nothing and having water and water and Raymond food and wetness let us there be water if we have food and if we have Raymond in other words if we have clothing Paul said that's it I mean first Timothy chapter six Paul say that's it amen so if I give you food and I give you clothing everything is good in your life I'm asking you a question if I forgive you food and make sure all your clothing and all your food comes together so it's finished [Music] do you see how we interpret Paul because if it's the case we work for food and for clothing they will catch your Duke Power they will turn your Duke power off they will catch your

money love of water honey everybody good they love money let's go slowly God wants you to prosper relax okay but the Love of Money what is Paul saying For the Love of Money is the water rule of water

word Memon translated means water the world he said you eat the soft one and hate the other or vice versa Jesus said so in Saint Matthew the fifth chapter can serve the God and the world at the same time you get to be one or the water the other in the message investment brother Branham say you can't hold to the love of the world and to God at the same time you cannot love God and Mama which means the water the world if you love the world or the things of the world the love of the father is not water in you like the world Jesus said you cannot serve God and who my man is the water the world can

please slow down but the Lily don't worry about it they really just grow any gross he doesn't worry about tomorrow he doesn't worry about the weather he doesn't worry about nothing the key word is worrying anxiety taking cut being tormented about something can I continue jump to First study wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you all you of water so your clothing is in the faith your food is in the faith your drinking is in the faith faith toward God that's why Jesus said have faith in when

brother Branham says also he says in the days of what Lord if you want to market the scripture in Luke 17 what 28 they were water eating they were water drinking they did water and they did what so push the bread is anything wrong with that no sir why is the scripture saying this listen to brother brother Branham say ordinarily legitimate things but watch and they that did what occupy but they put all the water your mind on it but the problem is saying in the time of lot the mind of the people were now constantly about drinking eating drinking in other words they don't want anything to do
