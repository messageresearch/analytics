[21:11] got an email
[21:12] from google the internship i've been
[21:14] trying to get in since like the middle
[21:17] of the summer
[21:18] and first the first evil they sent me
[21:20] was saying i was put on the waiting list
[21:22] and so i just prayed about it
[21:24] and you know i'm on a waiting list that
[21:26] does not mean i'm not accepted right so
[21:30] two minutes before they called me i got
[21:32] an email and i was i was in the middle
[21:33] of the class like class was still going
[21:36] and it was like yo i was accepted i was
[21:38] i just jumped i said thank you jesus i
[21:39] was so happy like i'm like oh my god
[21:42] so then like i was like i was about to
[21:45] call him was like the
[21:47] the missile dismissal bell ring and we
[21:49] were leaving and
[21:51] i was going to call them they caught me
[21:53] first
[21:53] and then my mom was like we got an
[21:55] accident with you know 18 wheels like a
[21:58] truck okay you know
[22:00] but
[22:01] it's just
[22:02] a guy who works in mysterious ways
[22:05] so i just want to give him the glory and
[22:06] the praise and just he's an awesome guy
[22:09] hallelujah amen praise god praise god
[22:14] [Applause]
[22:16] god bless everyone this morning
[22:18] um
[22:19] when i went out to kentucky
[22:21] it was actually a covet outbreak
[22:24] um but what uh my wife gave the
[22:28] testimony part way last week
[22:30] but the fullness thereof was that the um
[22:33] the individual on my team that caught
[22:36] the virus
[22:37] i actually sat next to him for two hours
[22:41] didn't catch it
[22:43] but before i before i actually went
[22:46] the um there's an app that i read a
[22:47] message app called family alter
[22:50] and you know there's a lot of
[22:51] inspiration given in that
[22:54] what i normally do is sometimes if my
[22:56] day gets too far gone you know i can
[22:59] pray every day and i can read my script
[23:01] but in the app it gives you a quote and
[23:03] it gives you scripture
[23:04] so you know you're really killing two
[23:05] birds with one stone
[23:07] so when i went there
[23:09] i had when i read it
[23:11] the scriptures told me that the lord was
[23:12] with me just an anointing came over my
[23:14] heart and i didn't know why but i said
[23:16] okay lord you're with me out here
[23:19] but unbeknownst to me
[23:21] he said he got the shot the vaccine he
[23:23] was raving about the vaccine shot you
[23:25] know but he still caught it
[23:27] every day this gentleman bought me food
[23:30] from from hand to hand bought me food
[23:32] every day i was there
[23:34] not only did he buy me the food every
[23:35] day but
[23:36] when when you uh on a big job like like
[23:40] as such when you're placing a lot of
[23:42] concrete you know you're there for i
[23:44] mean that job i was just pouring
[23:45] concrete for 12 hours straight
[23:47] so there's times with out of you just
[23:49] restroom he had to come and take the
[23:50] controller from me to operate it
[23:53] still nothing
[23:54] you know so i'm i'm and on top of that
[23:57] as i was there throughout that week i
[23:59] had a chance to testify to some of the
[24:01] individuals out there
[24:03] and
[24:04] i didn't know jeffersonville was less
[24:06] than an hour away from me
[24:09] so as i spoke to the individual and
[24:11] started testifying to him he started to
[24:13] inquire
[24:14] now when i come back we get in this
[24:16] accident there's a lot of other things
[24:18] going on so in my mind i'm like okay
[24:20] lord you're doing something
[24:22] and when i checked the book of acts you
[24:24] know when when the lord started moving
[24:26] to demonstrate his power it was always
[24:28] uh persecution done to his people
[24:33] now they told me that i needed to go
[24:34] back
[24:35] so i believe i'm going back to deal with
[24:37] that soul
[24:39] so just just keep us in prayer but i
[24:41] just wanted to give god praise because
[24:43] to see a supernatural move like that to
[24:45] where that that virus didn't touch me
[24:47] and i was next to him and there's no
[24:49] reason that i shouldn't have caught it
[24:51] mentally thinking
[24:53] but by god's grace was about the power
[24:55] of god i didn't catch him that's just a
[24:57] testimony to the power that we're
[24:59] entering into right now and i thank the
[25:01] lord for it
[25:03] praise god
[25:04] amen praise god
[25:07] praise god amen i
[25:10] totally relate to your testimony brother
[25:12] charles
[25:13] amen was there anyone to put their hand
[25:15] up
[25:16] brother yes bro
[25:21] god bless your sense
[25:22] i just wanted to thank the lord for his
[25:24] protection over me uh my family
[25:27] usually every day like four days a week
[25:30] i go pick up my mom from work we live
[25:32] near huntersville and her job is in
[25:35] south carolina near rock hill so it's
[25:37] about an hour drive
[25:39] my job doesn't require me to really
[25:42] doesn't really allow me to get that
[25:43] tired because it's very easy
[25:46] so for some reason i think last
[25:49] thursday
[25:50] last wednesday after church
[25:52] i was really tired
[25:54] so after i came coming into church i
[25:56] would head back home i tried to get some
[25:58] sleep but when i woke up around two in
[26:00] the morning to go get her i was still
[26:02] extremely tired so i put myself a coffee
[26:05] i had a guy into the car i prayed just a
[26:08] quick prayer father protect me from
[26:10] going into coming back amen so
[26:13] i got into the highway around
[26:15] 1 in 1 588
[26:18] and
[26:19] the whole drive
[26:21] from my house from the highway
[26:23] to
[26:25] her workplace which is about 45 50
[26:27] minutes
[26:28] i fell asleep
[26:30] there is nothing that i remember for
[26:32] that moment for those
[26:34] minutes from entering the highway to her
[26:37] place
[26:38] i didn't know how i made it to work to
[26:40] her work
[26:41] the next thing i know i was in the
[26:43] parking lot and she was knocking on a
[26:44] door to get in
[26:46] so she got in the car

[43:06] nobody behind
[43:09] anybody behind
[43:11] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[43:14] we don't want anyone
[43:16] to lag behind
[43:19] nobody
[43:22] we must fight be brave
[43:25] you know that all right
[43:28] can't ride a neither
[43:32] okay
[43:34] ah you heard brother robert
[43:35] [Laughter]
[43:38] amen psalm chapter 69 we read this psalm
[43:42] before
[43:44] and we're going to dig into it because
[43:46] we need to pull judah out of here
[43:50] amen
[43:52] anybody understood the abiliter
[43:57] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[44:00] 22
[44:03] let their table became become a snare in
[44:08] other words a trap
[44:10] before them
[44:12] you know david's prayer
[44:14] now you understand why he was praying
[44:16] like this
[44:17] not for the elect
[44:18] and he was doing that under the
[44:20] inspiration of the holy spirit
[44:23] so it was not actually david but it was
[44:25] the holy spirit
[44:26] because david one time was crying at his
[44:29] palace in his palace my father my father
[44:32] well i have that forsaken me
[44:34] the soldier thought like what is going
[44:36] on somebody abandoned the king say uh-uh
[44:39] it's not me somebody was coming down the
[44:41] road who's gonna cry amen
[44:44] he says
[44:45] verse 22
[44:47] and that which should have been for
[44:49] their welfare
[44:51] let it become a trap
[44:53] so god sent something to them for their
[44:56] good
[44:57] for their welfare david said take that
[45:00] turn it into what
[45:02] into a trap the stone that was precious
[45:05] to somebody else
[45:07] but that same stone can be a
[45:10] a trap in other words a stumbling block
[45:13] to someone else depending on your origin
[45:18] you might be seated
[45:20] amen
[45:22] let their eyes be darkened
[45:26] the word make them blind
[45:29] labor day weekend a lot of folks out
[45:32] [Laughter]
[45:34] let their eyes be darkened
[45:36] that they see not
[45:39] and make their lawns continually to
[45:41] shake
[45:43] pour out your wrath your indignation
[45:47] upon them
[45:48] and let your wrathful anger
[45:51] take hold of them
[45:53] if you notice here it's not one person
[45:57] it is many people
[45:59] them them them their means the many
[46:02] plural a lot of people amen
[46:05] verse 25
[46:07] let there not his habitation
[46:11] let their
[46:13] habitation be desolate
[46:16] so right here
[46:18] david is praying
[46:21] and he wants there i want you to keep
[46:24] that in mind
[46:25] there
[46:27] it is many people
[46:29] maybe millions
[46:32] amen
[46:33] their habitation
[46:37] be what
[46:39] they want that to be desolate
[46:43] amen
[46:45] blessed be the name of the lord
[46:47] let their habitation be dazzling
[46:50] and let none
[46:52] dwell in their tent again their tent is
[46:56] plural
[46:58] not singular
[47:02] so they will have tents
[47:04] they will have habitation
[47:07] they're gonna dwell in those tent they
[47:10] will dwell in those habitation but after
[47:13] a while that habitation
[47:15] need to be
[47:16] voided of them
[47:18] in other words that habitation need to
[47:20] be empty
[47:22] amen and nobody is supposed to dwell
[47:25] there
[47:28] hallelujah
[47:29] why
[47:31] for they persecute him
[47:34] whom you have smitten
[47:36] who was meeting of god
[47:38] christ they persecuted him was he one
[47:42] person
[47:45] day
[47:47] day
[47:48] day
[47:50] there
[47:51] amen
[47:52] for they persecuted him whom you have
[47:55] smitten
[47:57] and they talked to the grief of those
[47:59] whom you have water
[48:01] wounded
[48:04] add iniquity
[48:07] to their iniquity
[48:10] there
[48:11] and let them plural
[48:14] not come into your righteousness in
[48:17] other words block them
[48:19] so that they will never
[48:21] be able to come to righteousness
[48:24] because if you come to righteousness you
[48:26] are saved in other words do not save
[48:29] them
[48:31] holy spirit you don't want some other
[48:33] people to be saved
[48:35] when we want to save everybody
[48:38] amen
[48:40] let them be blooded out of the book
[48:44] so right here not only are their
[48:47] habitation going to be desolate
[48:50] but what happened is they are blocked to
[48:52] salvation
[48:55] everybody clear
[48:57] they are blocked to salvation
[49:00] and not only are they blocked to
[49:02] salvation
[49:03] because of their transgression
[49:06] their name have to be removed from the
[49:08] book of life
[49:12] anybody clear
[49:18] amen
[49:19] why
[49:20] they persecuted christ
[49:22] and by doing that they're losing their
[49:25] right to salvation
[49:27] and they also having their name removed
[49:30] from the book of life to have a name
[49:32] removed from the book of life it means
[49:34] your name was there
[49:37] the problem is
[49:39] the name will not remain
[49:44] amen
[49:45] abide
[49:47] like a biafra you remember
[49:50] amen
[49:51] let them be bloated out of the book of
[49:54] the living
[49:55] and not be written with the
[49:58] so the book of life is truly the book of
[50:01] the righteous
[50:04] you see that
[50:05] but among the righteous among the good
[50:08] seed
[50:09] somebody planted a wrong seed
[50:12] but it will come a time when the wrong
[50:14] seed need to be removed
[50:16] so that the righteous will no longer
[50:18] dwell
[50:19] with the one who is a wicked
[50:22] amen
[50:22] in other words some people
[50:25] will have their name in the book of life
[50:28] but their name will be removed
[50:31] and those people will never be able to
[50:34] reach salvation
[50:36] amen
[50:37] because of what
[50:39] because of where they came from
[50:42] amen
[50:43] the book of life will not hold their
[50:45] name they cannot remain in the book of
[50:48] life their name have to be taken out
[50:51] of the book of life amen
[50:55] so
[50:57] everybody who's among theirs
[51:02] number one their habitation will be
[51:04] desolate
[51:06] number two they won't reach salvation
[51:09] they can be in the group
[51:11] but they won't reach salvation
[51:14] and number three their names are gonna
[51:16] be taken out
[51:18] i'm going this way because that devil
[51:21] outside of the message is very wicked
[51:24] amen
[51:25] and if somebody comes and begin to
[51:27] question you and corner you now you have
[51:30] a devil answer that you can give it to
[51:33] them
[51:33] amen
[51:35] so before i continue i want you to
[51:37] always
[51:38] keep this principle especially young
[51:41] people
[51:43] in the book of matthew chapter 26 verse
[51:46] 17 and it's very important if not you're
[51:49] going to be blurred in a scripture and
[51:52] the message will be tough for you
[51:54] the bible says in chapter 17 here in
[51:57] verse 17
[51:58] now the first day
[52:00] of the feast of our library of eleventh
[52:03] bread the disciple came to jesus
[52:06] saying unto him
[52:08] where will thou that we prepare for thee
[52:11] to eat the what
[52:13] the passover so right here in matthew
[52:16] it's talking about the first day of the
[52:18] first of the feast of 11 bread and it's
[52:21] a preparation for the passover everybody
[52:24] clear
[52:25] now when you go to the book of mark
[52:27] on on chapter 14 verse 12 the bible
[52:31] repeat again the same thing
[52:33] but now it's not matthew because matthew
[52:35] is a lion
[52:37] he's an apostle
[52:38] hey but here and mark is a pastor
[52:42] because he's the oxen
[52:47] is a knox
[52:49] of the team
[52:50] go check your website you're going to
[52:52] see that quote there
[52:53] and the first day of the 11th bread
[52:56] when they killed the water
[52:59] the same thing
[53:00] his disciples said unto him where will
[53:03] da
[53:04] that we go and prepare that that may eat
[53:07] the water
[53:08] same scripture here same story everybody
[53:12] clear
[53:13] in the book of luke who is now a teacher
[53:16] because luke was a doctor
[53:18] he was an m.d
[53:23] dan kim you need that scripture you let
[53:26] me know i will give it to you
[53:28] and then came the day of the water
[53:31] unleavened bread unleavened bread
[53:33] unleavened bread window
[53:36] passover passover passover must be water
[53:41] so if you want to understand
[53:44] this story very well
[53:46] you need to put those three scriptures
[53:49] together
[53:50] make sense
[53:51] if you only get one scripture you're not
[53:54] gonna get the full picture of it
[53:57] why
[53:58] are you pointing to this
[54:01] we already understand it's the same
[54:03] story
[54:04] number two
[54:06] eighteen and he said go into the city
[54:10] who will go into the city
[54:13] how many
[54:14] based on that scripture do you know
[54:16] their name
[54:18] do you know their number
[54:22] so based on matthew we know that he sent
[54:26] disciple
[54:27] we don't know who whether it's bar tell
[54:30] me whether it's peter whether it's
[54:32] andrew or john we don't know whether
[54:34] it's look
[54:35] amen and how many disciples we don't
[54:38] know whether it's two whether it's three
[54:40] or four or five we don't know
[54:42] so if you stuck with matthew with an
[54:45] apostle he's gonna give you a blur
[54:48] vision
[54:50] he's giving you the vision but it's not
[54:53] too clear
[55:09] everybody clear
[55:10] so if we only preach you matthew
[55:21] are we okay
[55:22] if we continue with the church and every
[55:26] day in the church matthew is the one
[55:28] preaching
[55:30] you will get a panoramic view
[55:35] of the message
[55:41] you can grasp the message
[55:44] but it's going to be in a general way
[55:47] when they ask you about the message your
[55:50] answers are going to be general
[55:53] god sent the disciple that's all i know
[55:57] because you've been preached by matthew
[56:02] okay let's continue
[56:05] to search a man and say unto him the
[56:08] master said if my time is at hand i will
[56:11] keep the passover at that house with my
[56:14] disciple
[56:15] and they what
[56:16] they disciple how many disciple
[56:20] what are their name
[56:23] my few can only stop there
[56:27] and they disciple we don't know who they
[56:30] are and we don't even know their name
[56:32] their number and they disciple because
[56:34] they were 12. so with matthew preaching
[56:37] to you
[56:39] brother
[56:40] uh enoch can say that god sent maybe 12
[56:43] disciple
[56:46] brother mickey will say god sent for
[56:48] disciple
[56:50] he's still right because he says
[56:51] disciple
[56:53] 4 is plural 12 is plural 2 is plural
[56:57] three is plural
[57:03] hallelujah
[57:05] and the disciple did as jesus had
[57:07] appointed them and they made ready the
[57:10] water
[57:11] the passover now let's go to the pastor
[57:14] mark
[57:15] and see what's wrong with the pastor
[57:18] the pastor said in verse 13 and he sent
[57:21] forth how many
[57:26] do you want to have matthew alone or you
[57:29] want to have matthew and mark
[57:34] now
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:36] if brother mickey said four his answer
[57:39] is no longer good
[57:43] he was good under matthew
[57:47] everybody clear
[57:49] church i'm trying to shake away the
[57:51] loose
[57:52] feather amen
[57:54] so no more game in a message
[57:58] okay
[57:59] now whoever said three who has they say
[58:02] four or five or whoever say more than
[58:05] two is not correct
[58:10] now the pastor stabilizes you
[58:13] [Music]
[58:14] okay
[58:15] the pastor granted you more
[58:18] now you're a little bit stable
[58:20] amen we know now each disciple praise
[58:23] the lord plural praise the lord how many
[58:26] disciples two
[58:29] who are they
[58:31] we don't know
[58:35] it's too disciple somebody can say
[58:37] brother hamilton can say it was luke and
[58:40] john
[58:42] but a defense might say it was about
[58:44] telling me an angel
[58:47] they're right it's only two so you can
[58:50] pick two
[58:52] the devil still play around with you
[58:59] make sense now
[59:04] you will understand why a ministry can
[59:06] be attacked
[59:08] by the devil
[59:09] and not the other ministry
[59:16] did you get what i was saying
[59:19] do you get what i'm saying you're gonna
[59:20] see one ministry there are five four
[59:22] ministries but you see the devil
[59:25] attacking one more
[59:30] you will see the devil always try to
[59:33] destroy one
[59:34] to put a a bad test to one
[59:38] and the other one he can leave them
[59:40] alone
[59:40] [Music]

[1:03:16] god can't give a revelation
[1:03:19] uh can't give a first revelation than a
[1:03:22] second revelation
[1:03:24] if he did he will be changing his mind
[1:03:28] he can give a revelation
[1:03:31] and then add to it
[1:03:33] he's not changing the first
[1:03:36] as he did in the garden of eden when he
[1:03:39] promised the seed to the woman and then
[1:03:42] later designated that seed had to come
[1:03:45] through abraham and then later say it
[1:03:47] would come by the same bloodline in
[1:03:50] heaven but he was the water the same
[1:03:54] revelation he only give the people more
[1:03:58] information to help them

[1:04:23] longer play with the name because now we
[1:04:26] are precise
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:04:31] based on what i said
[1:04:34] let's go to matthew chapter 10.
[1:04:41] everybody clear

[1:05:20] there must be something in me that i
[1:05:22] have not discovered yet

[1:06:07] this you won't understand where i'm
[1:06:09] traveling

[1:06:11] and he called to him his twelve disciple
[1:06:15] he gave them power against water
[1:06:18] unclean spirit
[1:06:20] to cast them out
[1:06:22] and to heal all manner of sickness and
[1:06:25] all manner of disease including

[1:24:51] lord that is making people sleep in
[1:24:54] church in the name of jesus christ
[1:24:57] father made the power of the holy spirit
[1:24:59] job
[1:25:00] may you come lord and relax your
[1:25:02] children and speak to us lord in a
[1:25:04] mighty way in the name of jesus christ
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:09] god bless you as you already been seated
[1:25:12] ever clear
[1:25:14] we on part nine of the second banquet
[1:25:17] origin it's part seven
[1:25:19] anybody clear
[1:25:20] on wednesday we demonstrated to you
[1:25:23] that there are two group we already know
[1:25:25] that
[1:25:26] and we says that the group on the right
[1:25:28] side
[1:25:29] because they came out of god they are
[1:25:31] eternal
[1:25:32] just like god is eternal everybody clear
[1:25:36] and on the left side it's the group of
[1:25:38] the devil and jesus already showed us
[1:25:40] that there is no connection no gene
[1:25:43] connection between him and the devil and
[1:25:46] his children ever care that's why christ
[1:25:49] said that of all that you have given
[1:25:52] unto me i have lost no one except the
[1:25:56] son of perdition because he doesn't
[1:25:58] belong to me he's not ma'am my child in
[1:26:00] other words amen and that group was not
[1:26:03] eternal but it's temporarily
[1:26:06] temporal and brother branham said the
[1:26:08] devil is not eternal everybody clear
[1:26:12] this origin is important
[1:26:15] not only to understand the second death
[1:26:18] but to understand who you are
[1:26:20] and this origin also shows you that if
[1:26:24] you came from the right origin you're
[1:26:26] gonna remain in the world the origin or
[1:26:29] your lineage will determine whether you
[1:26:32] can continue in the world or not
[1:26:35] we seen abiator on wednesday how he
[1:26:38] helped david he carried the ark of the
[1:26:41] covenant he was there consulting god but
[1:26:43] because of the wrong lineage abiado was
[1:26:47] not able to remain with david he have to
[1:26:51] rebel against david because the man was
[1:26:54] victim of his origin
[1:26:56] everybody clear brother branham say
[1:26:59] hungry people
[1:27:00] every man is trying to look beyond
[1:27:03] behind the curtain
[1:27:05] to see where he comes from
[1:27:09] amen
[1:27:10] and where he's going
[1:27:12] if you know where you're coming from
[1:27:15] it's going to tell you where you're
[1:27:16] going if you come from hell
[1:27:19] automatically you have a visa back to
[1:27:22] hell
[1:27:24] if you came from god you're going to go
[1:27:26] back to god
[1:27:27] and brother branham say everybody hungry
[1:27:30] people are trying to know where they
[1:27:33] come from and where they are going where
[1:27:36] they are going is not a big deal really
[1:27:39] if you know where you come from
[1:27:42] everybody clear
[1:27:43] if you won't teach it to your church
[1:27:48] and give the salvation that he need to
[1:27:51] his soul
[1:27:52] he is a son of god in his fallen state
[1:27:56] yet he is a son of god and he wants to
[1:27:59] see out yonder he long to see it so
[1:28:02] brother branham is showing here that
[1:28:04] sons of god
[1:28:05] wanted to know up beyond what is
[1:28:09] in the mortal womb they want to know
[1:28:11] where they came from and brother branham
[1:28:13] said you need to be taught to the church
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:18] everybody fear
[1:28:19] god
[1:28:20] help we ministers
[1:28:23] to get to the place where we can do it
[1:28:27] introduced to them to the children of
[1:28:30] god the true and living god
[1:28:33] and they think that they're so hungerful
[1:28:38] after
[1:28:39] they have confessed and became water
[1:28:42] so when somebody is converted and become
[1:28:46] christian we need to bring the proper
[1:28:49] food
[1:28:50] that's going to satisfy your soul
[1:28:54] you cannot be 40 years old and continue
[1:28:57] to drink milk
[1:28:59] amen
[1:29:01] something is wrong
[1:29:03] ever clear
[1:29:05] but banham says here in the god who's
[1:29:07] reaching mercy he said now we are part
[1:29:10] of god
[1:29:11] you always was
[1:29:13] remove that pressure that you have to go
[1:29:15] somewhere
[1:29:18] amen where i need to preach quickly so
[1:29:21] you can leave
[1:29:24] now we are part of god
[1:29:26] you always was
[1:29:28] you don't remember it because you were
[1:29:31] only an attributing god
[1:29:33] you were only in his thinking we already
[1:29:36] explained you this your very name if it
[1:29:40] ever was on the book of life he was put
[1:29:43] there before the foundation of the world
[1:29:46] he knew what you were
[1:29:48] i am only saying this i'm only teaching
[1:29:52] this
[1:29:53] why
[1:29:54] not to mix up doctrine but to strengthen
[1:29:58] it out
[1:30:00] that we must get away from this fear and
[1:30:03] what
[1:30:04] so to remove faith from the children of
[1:30:06] god
[1:30:08] that uncertainty am i a child of god or
[1:30:11] not
[1:30:12] i got mad against my husband or maybe i
[1:30:15] should not do this because a christian
[1:30:17] is not supposed to do this yes a
[1:30:19] christian is not supposed to do this
[1:30:21] but that doesn't determine whether
[1:30:24] you're a child of god or not
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:31] brother branham said the pharisees have
[1:30:34] the fruit of the spirit ten times more
[1:30:38] than jesus christ
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:42] there were people that you thought
[1:30:45] believed the message more than you there
[1:30:48] were more bias to the message
[1:30:51] they were more long just to the message
[1:30:54] but when the test came they could not
[1:30:57] stay in the message they rejected the
[1:31:00] message so what is really showing who is
[1:31:03] the son of god
[1:31:05] [Music]
[1:31:08] when you were close to these people you
[1:31:10] thought they were more set than you
[1:31:13] and today the same people are wearing
[1:31:16] pants
[1:31:16] why are you not wearing pants
[1:31:21] why are you not wearing paint and
[1:31:24] somebody is wearing paint and you
[1:31:26] thought they were more spiritual than
[1:31:28] you
[1:31:32] hallelujah
[1:31:33] it is to remove this fear and scare you
[1:31:37] don't know who you are
[1:31:39] you are not going to be
[1:31:42] but now you are something god
[1:31:45] see you always wear the sons of god
[1:31:53] i am bringing you to the state to stop
[1:31:56] looking at yourself
[1:31:58] look at what god put in you
[1:32:01] and focus on the inside man
[1:32:04] if the inside man is line up with god it
[1:32:08] will bring the outside
[1:32:10] automatically in line with god the
[1:32:13] problem in the message we work with the
[1:32:17] outside man and we left the inside men
[1:32:20] and people became a bunch of hypocrites
[1:32:23] [Applause]
[1:32:26] 20 years in the message racist
[1:32:29] 20 years in the message can't get
[1:32:32] anything straight in line they don't
[1:32:34] understand nothing they don't want
[1:32:36] nothing from god
[1:32:39] yet they claim to be message believers
[1:32:45] start from your heart
[1:32:48] start from the inside
[1:32:50] prepare the heart
[1:32:52] malachi 4 came to turn there
[1:32:55] the heart of the children back to the
[1:32:58] pentecost
[1:32:59] once their heart is turned
[1:33:02] their body automatically will be aligned
[1:33:05] to the world
[1:33:06] it won't be a striving anymore
[1:33:09] it's gonna be a pleasure to serve god
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:17] if not you put a bunch of legalistic
[1:33:20] underprison
[1:33:25] i'm doing this if i don't do this they
[1:33:27] will say this
[1:33:29] hallelujah
[1:33:31] if you want to get upset get upset
[1:33:38] amen and let god clean that temple out
[1:33:42] of you
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:45] after you got upset you said father i
[1:33:48] don't like this nature i don't know how
[1:33:51] to get rid of it may you come and remove
[1:33:53] it when god remove it who does the sun
[1:33:58] have set free is free indeed
[1:34:02] [Applause]
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:10] the message is not a religion
[1:34:15] hallelujah
[1:34:17] you always were a son of god
[1:34:20] jesus said if he abandoned me
[1:34:23] and my word in you saint john 15
[1:34:28] if he abandoned me see
[1:34:30] have faith in him
[1:34:34] he abide in me
[1:34:36] and my word abide in you
[1:34:39] but for your word for his word to abide
[1:34:41] in you you must have a receiver
[1:34:45] you remember you must have an absorbent
[1:34:48] if not your his word have no place in
[1:34:51] you
[1:34:52] so if his word is already abiding in you
[1:34:55] it is telling you you are child of god
[1:35:02] hallelujah
[1:35:04] a bad in my word
[1:35:06] then you ask what you will
[1:35:09] now see
[1:35:10] he knew who he was
[1:35:14] therefore he had what
[1:35:16] self could produce when he knowed what
[1:35:21] he was
[1:35:24] if he abandoned me and my word in you
[1:35:27] then you know who you are
[1:35:31] and when you know who you are ask what
[1:35:33] you will and it shall be given to you
[1:35:39] the original help you understand who you
[1:35:43] are
[1:35:44] and when you know who you are it gives
[1:35:47] you faith and confidence
[1:35:50] and when you are approaching god you're
[1:35:52] not approaching a man who's always angry
[1:35:56] at you
[1:35:57] you're not approaching a man who is
[1:35:59] always disappointed at you because you
[1:36:02] got mad to your husband
[1:36:04] you are approaching a man who
[1:36:06] understands you a man who's your father
[1:36:10] a high priest that can be touched by
[1:36:13] your infirmity he understands you more
[1:36:16] than yourself
[1:36:26] because perfect love
[1:36:28] casts out what
[1:36:30] happened
[1:36:33] amen
[1:36:35] hallelujah
[1:36:36] we found out that in jude chapter uh
[1:36:40] verse five the bible said i will
[1:36:42] therefore put you in remembrance
[1:36:45] though you knew this once
[1:36:47] how did the lord
[1:36:49] having served the people out of the land
[1:36:51] of egypt
[1:36:52] after all destroyed them that believe
[1:36:54] not we found that on wednesday there
[1:36:57] were no faith
[1:36:58] no they were baptized under moses into
[1:37:01] the cloud drunk water everything but
[1:37:03] there was no faith to be mixed with the
[1:37:05] sermon
[1:37:07] but faith is a gift of god
[1:37:09] and it's given by grace how are you
[1:37:11] going to receive it
[1:37:15] save them
[1:37:16] first
[1:37:17] brought them out of egypt and then had
[1:37:20] to destroy them because they didn't
[1:37:22] continue with their
[1:37:24] message
[1:37:27] anybody clear
[1:37:28] this thing
[1:37:30] started by their father
[1:37:33] the devil had the position in heaven
[1:37:37] but for some reason he served god he was
[1:37:41] the right hand man of god
[1:37:43] just like airmen was the right-hand man
[1:37:46] of king hazaris but for some reason
[1:37:50] there is something in the devil that he
[1:37:52] cannot abide in the truth
[1:37:55] why because there is no truth into him
[1:37:58] amen so he could not stay on his throne
[1:38:02] on his position he need to go to a
[1:38:04] different position anybody clear
[1:38:07] now let's get into judah
[1:38:10] the bible says man
[1:38:12] and brethren
[1:38:14] this scripture must need have been
[1:38:16] fulfilled
[1:38:18] which the holy ghost
[1:38:20] by the mouth of who
[1:38:22] so the psalm was written by who
[1:38:26] ander
[1:38:29] the holy ghost
[1:38:30] by the mouth of david
[1:38:32] speak
[1:38:34] before concerning who
[1:38:37] go
[1:38:38] in the psalm and show me the name of
[1:38:40] judah
[1:38:46] open the book of psalm
[1:38:48] and show me the name of judah
[1:38:51] remember
[1:38:52] your name are written a certain way
[1:38:56] you remember in the bible
[1:38:59] you remember the bible
[1:39:00] so how can you chase brother branham by
[1:39:05] 11. come on
[1:39:13] the holy spirit spoke about who judah
[1:39:16] god showed me where the holy spirit said
[1:39:18] judah
[1:39:20] the holy spirit spoke about john the
[1:39:22] baptist
[1:39:23] god in the old testament show me john
[1:39:26] the baptist
[1:39:27] john the baptist could only tell you i
[1:39:30] am isaiah 40.
[1:39:35] so his name was written in
[1:39:38] symbols
[1:39:40] so when you say isaiah 40
[1:39:43] something in john the baptist begin to
[1:39:46] bubble
[1:39:49] and only john the baptist
[1:39:52] will be quickened with that scripture
[1:40:03] hallelujah
[1:40:04] hallelujah
[1:40:05] that's why you heard jesus say this day
[1:40:08] this scripture has been worked
[1:40:11] he identified himself in the scripture
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:18] hallelujah
[1:40:19] the holy ghost spoke spake in the mouth
[1:40:23] of david concerning who
[1:40:25] which was guide
[1:40:27] to them that took jesus
[1:40:30] he became a guide
[1:40:32] another guide
[1:40:34] four
[1:40:35] he was numbered with us
[1:40:39] and had obtained part of this ministry
[1:40:45] judah number one he was numbered
[1:40:50] not all israel is israel he was among
[1:40:55] the very disciples of jesus christ
[1:40:58] among these 12
[1:41:00] judah was there judah was also there and
[1:41:03] his name was written in the book of life
[1:41:06] anybody clear
[1:41:08] what does he mean
[1:41:10] by stephen in john chapter 13
[1:41:13] verse 10 and 11 the bible said jesus
[1:41:16] said to him he that is washed
[1:41:20] needed not
[1:41:21] safe to wash his feet
[1:41:23] but is clean every week
[1:41:27] the language of jesus is very
[1:41:29] complicated
[1:41:31] if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:41:34] jesus was actually washing the disciples
[1:41:37] feet
[1:41:38] everybody
[1:41:39] so the disciple was sucked into the feet
[1:41:43] washing
[1:41:44] as he was watching their feet they were
[1:41:47] talking about defeat jesus already left
[1:41:51] that dimension he was already in a
[1:41:53] different dimension
[1:41:56] and jesus taught them he said
[1:41:58] you are clean
[1:42:00] but not all
[1:42:04] so that
[1:42:06] he was probably talking about maybe
[1:42:08] somebody here didn't take a shower
[1:42:16] you see
[1:42:17] you are clean
[1:42:19] but not all
[1:42:23] jesus are you talking about somebody
[1:42:25] have their defeat or somebody didn't
[1:42:27] take a shower
[1:42:28] because we are washing our feet
[1:42:31] but jesus was already talking about the
[1:42:34] origin in faith washington
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:42] said fall he did what
[1:42:45] he knew
[1:42:46] who should betray him
[1:42:49] therefore he said you are not all
[1:42:56] the children of god are clean children
[1:43:00] amen
[1:43:06] peter and all 11 disciples when god look
[1:43:10] at the gym they are clean
[1:43:13] not clean on the outside
[1:43:16] but cleaned by the insider
[1:43:20] yet jesus speak the word and say my word
[1:43:24] is truth
[1:43:25] he sanctified them jesus said i sanctify
[1:43:29] you by my word it's in john 17 17.
[1:43:34] so you thought everybody was clean but
[1:43:36] jesus came down again and said you are
[1:43:39] all clean
[1:43:40] there is one of you that is not clean
[1:43:45] yet i watch all of you
[1:43:47] but one of you even though i watch you
[1:43:50] one of you is not clean that clean is
[1:43:53] not in the physic
[1:43:54] that clean was of the insider of the
[1:43:58] origin
[1:44:01] i speak not of you all
[1:44:04] and i know whom i have chosen
[1:44:07] who chose judah
[1:44:09] jesus
[1:44:10] but that the scripture might be
[1:44:12] fulfilled he that it is prayed with me
[1:44:16] and had and has lift up his heel against
[1:44:19] me
[1:44:20] so he's talking about the disciple
[1:44:23] judah was among the disciples but he was
[1:44:27] the unclean one
[1:44:31] john 6
[1:44:33] jesus answered them
[1:44:35] have i not chose you how many
[1:44:38] he didn't say 11.
[1:44:42] so to be called in the ministry
[1:44:45] it's not enough
[1:44:51] amen to be chosen by god it's not enough
[1:44:58] that's why preachers get in trouble
[1:45:02] preaching the gospel doesn't mean your
[1:45:05] origin is right
[1:45:09] so from today don't be stumble when a
[1:45:12] preacher does not leave the word of god
[1:45:17] don't be stumble if a preacher is still
[1:45:20] battling prejudice
[1:45:23] don't be stumble if a preacher is a big
[1:45:26] liar
[1:45:27] don't be stumble if a preacher is a big
[1:45:31] hypocrite
[1:45:34] until jesus said when you come to the
[1:45:37] pharisees you listen to what they preach
[1:45:40] but don't follow their example
[1:45:43] because year of your father did
[1:45:45] therefore
[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:52] judah
[1:45:55] judas
[1:45:57] unclean
[1:46:00] ever clear
[1:46:01] yet chosen by god
[1:46:05] yet preaching the gospel
[1:46:08] yet casting our devil
[1:46:19] my god
[1:46:21] jesus answered them saying have i not
[1:46:24] charged you 12.
[1:46:25] and one of you is a sinner
[1:46:32] how can a human being be a devil
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:39] so judas
[1:46:40] was the devil
[1:46:43] that's why jesus said
[1:46:46] he is not clean
[1:46:52] make sense now
[1:46:53] because he was the devil in human flesh
[1:46:57] i'm gonna get to your angelic beings
[1:47:00] and you're gonna see who you were
[1:47:04] anybody clear
[1:47:06] one of you is the devil
[1:47:09] he speak of the spirit of judah
[1:47:16] he spoke of judah is carried the son of
[1:47:19] sermon for he he was that should betray
[1:47:23] him being one of the water
[1:47:26] but he was not clean because he was a
[1:47:29] demon by origin
[1:47:31] he was a son of
[1:47:34] perdition
[1:47:36] means
[1:47:37] he was a son of hell
[1:47:40] that's why he was not clean
[1:47:43] and the other was sons of weapon
[1:47:46] heaven that's why jesus said you're
[1:47:49] clean
[1:47:52] not they didn't make mistake
[1:47:54] not they took a shower or not
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:47:59] anybody here
[1:48:00] john 17
[1:48:02] while i was with them in the world i
[1:48:05] kept them in there
[1:48:09] the bible says in the book of revelation
[1:48:12] that there is a man that is coming on
[1:48:14] white horse right now
[1:48:16] in revelation 19
[1:48:18] and his name was called the weapon
[1:48:21] i keep them in there
[1:48:26] so you don't keep yourself in the world
[1:48:30] that's why those that you taught were
[1:48:32] more spiritual than you left
[1:48:35] and you who thought of yourself being
[1:48:38] less spiritual you still remain in the
[1:48:40] world somebody is keeping you
[1:48:49] i kept them in that name
[1:48:52] those that that gave us me are kept
[1:48:55] i have kept and none of them is water
[1:49:02] but the son of who
[1:49:05] because he is unclean
[1:49:08] if he gave me somebody
[1:49:10] they're gonna i'm gonna keep them in the
[1:49:12] world
[1:49:13] and they're gonna be lost
[1:49:15] america
[1:49:16] let's continue with judah
[1:49:18] john 17
[1:49:20] 12 brother branham say while i was with
[1:49:22] them in the world i just read it i have
[1:49:25] kept them in that name those who that
[1:49:27] gave me i have kept and none of them is
[1:49:30] lost but the son of perdition that the
[1:49:32] scripture might be fulfilled
[1:49:34] brother branham explained he says now if
[1:49:37] language means anything at all
[1:49:40] we must admit that judas was chosen by
[1:49:44] jesus
[1:49:49] yet he was not
[1:49:52] because he was a devil
[1:49:54] judah was also given to jesus by the
[1:49:57] father
[1:50:00] let it be noted here
[1:50:02] that the choosing
[1:50:04] and the giving
[1:50:05] is the exact parallel as in the
[1:50:08] illustration of moses and who
[1:50:12] jacob and who
[1:50:13] for thou issue and pharaoh were both
[1:50:18] foreign
[1:50:19] they were predestinated what
[1:50:22] while the end of moses and jacob was due
[1:50:26] was glorification
[1:50:29] one vessel of mercy the other vessel of
[1:50:32] water
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:35] for this cause i bound my knees unto the
[1:50:37] father
[1:50:38] of our lord jesus christ of whom the
[1:50:40] whole family in heaven and of his work
[1:50:44] name who
[1:50:50] we okay this ministry that he gave them
[1:50:54] was actually the sharing of his own
[1:50:57] ministry with them
[1:51:01] so the ministry that judah received was
[1:51:13] but he is a devil
[1:51:20] trying to help you
[1:51:22] yes sir
[1:51:23] for he says
[1:51:25] in matthew 9 35 38 and jesus went
[1:51:30] about all cities and villages
[1:51:32] teaching in their synagogue and
[1:51:34] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[1:51:37] healing every sickness and every disease
[1:51:40] among the people remember the same thing
[1:51:43] he told them
[1:51:44] right that's why he shared the part of
[1:51:46] the ministry anybody here but when he
[1:51:49] saw them melted he was moved with
[1:51:52] compassion on them because they fainted
[1:51:55] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[1:51:57] having no shepherd
[1:52:00] then say he unto his disciple they have
[1:52:03] a stool his plaintiffs but the laborers
[1:52:06] are few pray he therefore the lord of
[1:52:08] the harvest that he will send forth
[1:52:10] labor into his harvest so the part of
[1:52:14] the ministry that judas obtained
[1:52:17] is a correct ministry
[1:52:22] the birth of judah that judah obtained
[1:52:26] among the 12
[1:52:28] and then lost
[1:52:30] was neither inferior
[1:52:33] to the ministry of the other eleven
[1:52:35] nor was he a devilish foreign ministry
[1:52:39] interjected among the ministries of the
[1:52:42] other judah said devil
[1:52:46] lost a god-given holy ghost ministry
[1:52:51] judah never lost the holy ghost
[1:52:56] judah lost
[1:52:58] their holy ghost ministry
[1:53:04] judah never lost the holy ghost
[1:53:08] he lost the ministry
[1:53:10] of the holy ghost
[1:53:15] hallelujah
[1:53:16] lost a god given holy ghost ministry and
[1:53:20] killed himself and went to his own place
[1:53:24] his name was even in there
[1:53:27] but his name was what
[1:53:29] blotted out ever clear
[1:53:32] notice
[1:53:33] judah spirit never got to
[1:53:38] pentecost you understand now
[1:53:41] he cannot receive the holy ghost
[1:53:44] anybody
[1:53:45] he never went up to receive the holy
[1:53:47] ghost
[1:53:48] he could not
[1:53:50] because he's unclean
[1:53:52] he's a devil the holy ghost cannot
[1:53:55] baptize a devil
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:53:58] everybody clear but what did
[1:54:01] that judah spirit go forth
[1:54:04] he went for the bag of gold
[1:54:08] he loves money
[1:54:10] and still loves him
[1:54:12] if he goes about in the name of jesus
[1:54:15] doing mighty things and holding great
[1:54:17] meetings he still makes more money
[1:54:21] and buildings and education and
[1:54:23] everything with a material concept
[1:54:27] just watch the spirit that is upon them
[1:54:32] and don't be fooled
[1:54:33] judas was a judas went about one of the
[1:54:38] twelve and he did miracle too but he did
[1:54:41] not have the spirit of god as his own
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:47] make sense
[1:54:48] he did have a ministry
[1:54:51] he never got to pentecost as he was not
[1:54:56] he was not
[1:54:58] a true child of god
[1:55:04] hallelujah
[1:55:06] the bible says for it is written
[1:55:09] in the book of psalms
[1:55:11] let
[1:55:12] what
[1:55:15] let what
[1:55:21] so among deaths
[1:55:24] one of them is judah
[1:55:33] let if judah is here
[1:55:35] therefore judah will be blocked
[1:55:38] to salvation
[1:55:40] therefore
[1:55:41] judah's name must be what
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:44] that's why brother branham said he have
[1:55:46] his name in the book of life
[1:55:50] let his habitation be desolate
[1:55:53] let no man dwell therein and his
[1:55:56] bishopri
[1:55:58] let another take
[1:56:01] that he may take part of this ministry
[1:56:03] an apostleship from which judah by
[1:56:07] transgression did what
[1:56:09] that he might go to his own place
[1:56:15] let them preach salvation
[1:56:18] and deliverance through the power of god
[1:56:21] just like judah with a ministry imported
[1:56:25] by christ
[1:56:26] but because they are wrong seed
[1:56:31] origin
[1:56:32] consequently they have a wrong spirit
[1:56:35] motivating them
[1:56:39] what's wrong with their motives and the
[1:56:42] objective behind ministers
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:50] religious oh my they outshine the
[1:56:53] electing every and what
[1:56:57] that's why they could do things more
[1:56:58] than you
[1:57:00] until you feel like you're not a
[1:57:01] christian
[1:57:05] hallelujah but it is the audition not of
[1:57:09] christ for he looks for big crowds
[1:57:12] big programs
[1:57:14] and straddling sons among them they
[1:57:16] preach the second coming of christ
[1:57:19] but deny the advent of the prophet
[1:57:22] messenger
[1:57:27] though in power and son and true
[1:57:30] revelation he eclipsed them all brother
[1:57:33] problem is beyond them
[1:57:34] ah yes
[1:57:36] this false spirit that in the last day
[1:57:39] is so close to the real can be
[1:57:41] distinguished only by it what
[1:57:45] it cannot remain in the word
[1:57:48] it's deviation from the
[1:57:51] and whenever it is caught
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:54] in being entered
[1:57:57] it falls back on one argument not two
[1:58:01] we have already shown this to be false
[1:58:04] what is that argument we got the result
[1:58:07] don't we we have to be of god
[1:58:10] i pray for the sick they were healed you
[1:58:12] want to tell me god is now with me
[1:58:14] i cast out devils i was here you want to
[1:58:16] tell me god is now with me
[1:58:18] what do you do with the world
[1:58:21] because the devil cannot abide in the
[1:58:24] world
[1:58:26] oh i have a dream i saw this decent
[1:58:29] dream i don't care what your dreams say
[1:58:32] i don't care your revelation
[1:58:34] i don't care your sermon i want to see
[1:58:37] your life
[1:58:38] based by the word
[1:58:40] [Applause]
[1:58:44] what did the lord say what are you doing
[1:58:50] that's why jesus said marvel not on
[1:58:53] casting out devils
[1:58:55] but i want you to make sure your name is
[1:58:57] in the book if your name is in the book
[1:59:00] your behavior will show who you are
[1:59:04] check yourself examine yourself whether
[1:59:07] you are in the world
[1:59:10] in the faith
[1:59:13] ever here
[1:59:15] brother branham says this
[1:59:17] now i am sure that you have noticed
[1:59:20] that those whose name were in the book
[1:59:23] of life
[1:59:24] were a part of the religious order
[1:59:27] of that day that center around the true
[1:59:30] god and worship of him
[1:59:34] in other words
[1:59:36] if judah
[1:59:37] was in the book of life
[1:59:39] and his name was blotted out his
[1:59:42] habitation became jesuit if some other
[1:59:45] people have their name in the book of
[1:59:47] life what does it mean brother banham
[1:59:49] said to have
[1:59:51] the name in the book of life means
[1:59:54] whenever god is gonna do something
[1:59:56] religiously in a time you gonna be part
[1:59:59] of it
[2:00:00] but don't stop there
[2:00:03] you must make sure if your name will
[2:00:05] remain
[2:00:06] or your name will be blotted out you
[2:00:09] might be part of it but later on you're
[2:00:12] going to live
[2:00:17] hallelujah
[2:00:19] like judah that didn't go all
[2:00:23] the way
[2:00:25] all the way i'm going all the way
[2:00:28] see how judah was chosen of god
[2:00:31] he was instructed in truth
[2:00:33] they preached him everything
[2:00:35] they taught him the high heel they
[2:00:37] taught him the makeup they taught him
[2:00:39] the nails everything
[2:00:41] he shared the knowledge of the mysteries
[2:00:46] he had a ministry of power granted unto
[2:00:50] him
[2:00:51] and he healed the sick and cast out
[2:00:53] devil in jesus name
[2:00:57] not in the name of devils
[2:00:59] but when they showdown came he sought
[2:01:02] out for gold and political power
[2:01:05] he did not go up to pentecost
[2:01:08] to receive the spirit of god he was
[2:01:11] devoid of the spirit
[2:01:14] make no mistake about it
[2:01:17] spoken to him a person
[2:01:20] that is truly baptized
[2:01:23] brother michael by the holy ghost
[2:01:26] into the body of christ
[2:01:28] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[2:01:32] will be in the word
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:41] who got the holy ghost then
[2:01:44] we gave so many people holy ghost
[2:01:52] he will be in the world all the way
[2:01:57] that is the evidence
[2:01:59] of being baptized with the
[2:02:02] judah fell multitude fell right there
[2:02:07] and when they fell they go on in that
[2:02:10] word their names are taken off the book
[2:02:13] of life
[2:02:15] everybody
[2:02:16] a true seed of god a correct origin from
[2:02:21] god will always remain in the world
[2:02:27] take john chapter 6.
[2:02:32] hallelujah
[2:02:36] take john chapter 6.
[2:02:41] are you there
[2:02:43] let's look at someone
[2:02:46] verse 6 if you're there you can say amen
[2:02:49] many therefore of his what
[2:02:54] a few people you're still looking at
[2:02:56] open your scripture
[2:02:59] many therefore of his
[2:03:02] disciples
[2:03:04] when they had heard this
[2:03:07] say
[2:03:08] 60 john 6 60.
[2:03:11] are you there
[2:03:13] many therefore of his work
[2:03:16] not his enemy
[2:03:21] those that were in the message
[2:03:24] of the hour
[2:03:27] many therefore of his disciple
[2:03:31] when they have heard this say
[2:03:33] this is a
[2:03:36] a hard saying
[2:03:38] who can
[2:03:39] in other words who can understand this
[2:03:42] what he's preaching is too difficult
[2:03:46] do you think i preached something hard
[2:03:49] christ preached more harder than me
[2:03:54] and you pretend you can stand for jesus
[2:03:57] christ
[2:04:02] amen
[2:04:03] brother brother say he never even
[2:04:04] explain it
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:07] here the holy spirit is coming with
[2:04:09] grace to unfold it to you here no
[2:04:12] explanation
[2:04:14] take it or not
[2:04:17] america
[2:04:18] verse 6 61 when jesus knew in himself
[2:04:22] that his disciple murmured
[2:04:25] at it they begin to grumble
[2:04:28] he's preaching stuff we don't understand
[2:04:31] he said to them
[2:04:33] does this offend you
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:38] preaching is offending someone
[2:04:43] what is your origin
[2:04:45] [Music]
[2:04:48] amen
[2:04:49] what if you see in other words he makes
[2:04:52] another one complicated again
[2:04:56] instead of oh is it difficult for you
[2:04:58] let me explain it to you no let me make
[2:05:01] it harder again
[2:05:07] this is christ
[2:05:09] not brother stephen jesus himself
[2:05:12] what if you see
[2:05:14] you shall see the son of man
[2:05:17] ascending up where he was before
[2:05:20] it is the spirit that quickens the flesh
[2:05:24] prophet nothing the word that i speak to
[2:05:26] you their spirit and their water
[2:05:30] as hard as my messages
[2:05:33] as difficult as my message is to
[2:05:36] understand
[2:05:37] yet what seems to be hard and difficult
[2:05:40] is spirit and its life
[2:05:45] if it's spirit in its life what is your
[2:05:47] responsibility just say amen
[2:05:53] are you there
[2:05:55] but
[2:05:57] the reason why you remembering

[2:06:07] that believe
[2:06:10] they are following jesus
[2:06:12] they are called the disciple of jesus
[2:06:15] but they never believe jesus
[2:06:17] but they are going with jesus everywhere

[2:06:21] but they were never convinced of what
[2:06:24] they are following
[2:06:30] never believe
[2:06:32] for jesus knew
