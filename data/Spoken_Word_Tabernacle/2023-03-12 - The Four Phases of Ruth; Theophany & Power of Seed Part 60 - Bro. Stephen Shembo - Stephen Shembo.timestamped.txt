[52:05] I'm even amazed there are few people
[52:07] that are still not having their number
[52:09] in the uh announcement group so if you
[52:13] miss an announcement it is beyond me
[52:15] that's between you and the Lord amen
[52:20] I already know how to deal with this
[52:22] amen
[52:24] glory to God that will be next Saturday
[52:26] on March the 18th everybody okay
[52:29] glory to God
[52:31] uh
[52:32] someone asked this question before
[52:36] and I was lingering to see how the
[52:39] spirit will lead how many received the
[52:41] message I sent throughout the week
[52:43] about the warning
[52:47] some didn't receive it
[52:50] okay
[52:51] praise God
[52:54] if you cannot receive the message you
[52:57] need to talk to Brother David
[52:58] so we make sure you receive it amen
[53:02] So based on that
[53:04] we discuss with the Deacon but I want to
[53:06] make sure the church decide what we want
[53:09] to do
[53:10] it's about prayer
[53:14] amen you need to increase your prayer
[53:18] we in a very treacherous time and the
[53:23] devil is fighting left and right amen we
[53:27] got somebody in the hospital we should
[53:29] not be playing around when someone is
[53:32] still lingering in the hospital
[53:34] somebody need to stand before the Lord
[53:36] and push very hard so that whoever is in
[53:39] the hospital need to come out amen so we
[53:43] came up with uh one Wednesday
[53:47] every
[53:48] two months
[53:50] after two months one Wednesday
[53:52] we will exert
[53:55] and then stop
[53:57] maybe exhort for 30 minutes
[54:00] and stop and then we start praying
[54:03] battle if you are streaming we will cut
[54:06] off the streaming
[54:08] we cannot let you on the streaming
[54:10] praying with people right here it's not
[54:13] going to work
[54:14] make sense
[54:16] because when people are praying they're
[54:18] praying so I don't know how we will keep
[54:20] the streaming on people praying if the
[54:23] spirit get on someone
[54:24] we don't want it
[54:26] going world one
[54:28] everybody okay
[54:29] so every two months one Wednesday
[54:33] we exhort a little bit for 30 minutes
[54:38] amen then we stop the exhortation and we
[54:42] start praying
[54:43] all the way to the end and we go home
[54:46] everybody is free to express what do you
[54:50] want if you are for it
[54:52] please raise your hand
[54:58] thank you my brother and sister if you
[55:00] are against it don't be shy
[55:03] we're not going to penalize you raise
[55:06] your hand even if you say no it's normal
[55:10] nobody is against it so brother Kelly we
[55:14] need to find out which one is it to
[55:16] start not every month because we have
[55:18] question and answer we don't want to
[55:20] overload you but every two months one
[55:24] Wednesday we exhort 30-minute stop
[55:26] exhorting we go to prayer if you want to
[55:29] pray you stay here pray pray pray pray
[55:31] until God come down
[55:34] amen then after prayer we all go home so
[55:38] we will get some refreshing everybody
[55:40] happy
[55:42] glory to God so that was about prayer
[55:45] Glory to God
[55:47] someone asked me this question so I'm
[55:49] going to remind it brother abrahamara

[55:56] a Sunday and on May the 3rd which is a
[56:00] Wednesday

[56:04] Sunday May 3rd which is a Wednesday and
[56:07] then on Thursday he will be heading
[56:08] straight to brother chadland everybody
[56:10] got that one
[56:12] amen glory to God yesterday we have a
[56:16] wonderful meeting
[56:18] I wish all of you were there not only to
[56:22] sing in the church
[56:24] but even when you're listening to the
[56:26] music at home
[56:27] you will know what kind of music to pick
[56:30] not even even if you don't want to sing
[56:33] in church but I wish all of you were
[56:35] here at this time I don't have a go
[56:38] ahead from the boss to release
[56:41] whatever was spoken yesterday
[56:44] for the public
[56:46] amen I will wait until he tells me to do
[56:49] that the meeting was three hours and 33
[56:53] minutes
[56:55] three three
[56:59] everybody okay we went through the
[57:02] scripture we went through code scripture
[57:04] quote scripture quote scripture we start
[57:07] with music from heaven
[57:08] and we drop it down I could not finish
[57:11] we have to stop at 3 hours 33 minutes
[57:15] so the next time you need to tell me
[57:17] brother John you need to work again we
[57:19] need to have part two where I'm going to
[57:21] deal with the music in church and the
[57:24] musician life themselves and we see how
[57:27] it's working but whatever was given
[57:29] yesterday is enough for you to get it
[57:33] and you can trace every single music all
[57:36] over the world
[57:37] amen like I said yesterday I said this
[57:41] church is like heaven
[57:43] amen we got black people we got
[57:46] Caucasian we got Hispanic we got people
[57:48] from Africa people it's like heaven and
[57:50] this is the way we're going to be in
[57:51] heaven so which music is right
[57:56] now which music is right
[57:59] American music
[58:00] African music Canadian music European
[58:04] music which music is that we dealt with
[58:07] it yesterday
[58:08] amen that's why we went in the word
[58:12] with the message of the hour and we lay
[58:15] everything so when we are calibrating
[58:18] music it doesn't have anything to do
[58:21] with your country
[58:22] it doesn't have anything to do with your
[58:25] civilization or your community nothing
[58:28] he has all of them have to do with the
[58:31] word of God
[58:33] amen amen in other words we can sing
[58:37] music for America we can sing music from
[58:39] Africa we can sing music from Europe we
[58:42] can sing music from South America as
[58:45] long as all those music can be filtered
[58:48] with what was presented yesterday
[58:52] everybody okay so there is no standard
[58:54] for me it is the standard of the word of
[58:57] God and the message of Yahweh
[59:00] everybody okay and I promise because we
[59:03] didn't finish I'm not gonna give it to
[59:05] you now but whoever won the quote that I
[59:09] was reading give your name to the Deacon
[59:13] so that by next question uh next uh
[59:16] music session I will have I will know
[59:18] how many copies we need and I will print
[59:21] them out the same quote I have yesterday
[59:22] because I had nine pages so I cannot put
[59:26] that on the group chat that would be a
[59:28] lot of work for me so if you want it you
[59:30] go ahead and you give your name to the
[59:32] Deacon so we know how many copies we
[59:34] need to copy and when you come in on the
[59:37] next uh part two of our music we hand it
[59:39] to you and we both read the code
[59:41] together and you take it for your
[59:43] reference everybody okay hey everybody
[59:45] okay so whatever was established
[59:49] yesterday there was a lot of people
[59:51] yesterday I took them as a witness
[59:54] between me and the church and before God
[59:57] if you are not there
[1:00:00] for legitimate reason praise the Lord if
[1:00:03] you know and you were not there that is
[1:00:05] between you and the Lord I don't have
[1:00:07] anybody's blood in my hand I did what I
[1:00:11] have to do I stay up till 5 a.m in the
[1:00:14] morning
[1:00:15] and then I woke up at nine o'clock
[1:00:18] toward ten o'clock and I was awaking all
[1:00:21] day up then I went home and sleep an
[1:00:24] hour and 30 minutes and I worked till
[1:00:26] four o'clock today and you see me in the
[1:00:29] morning
[1:00:30] so all that labor is because of you it
[1:00:33] is up to you to take advantage of it
[1:00:35] everybody okay
[1:00:37] so if you were not there that's between
[1:00:39] you and the Lord and the way we express
[1:00:41] it
[1:00:42] if you want to sing send your music
[1:00:45] ahead of time
[1:00:47] through the song leader I don't want any
[1:00:49] fusses with the song leader because we
[1:00:51] give you the same standard what was
[1:00:53] presented yesterday is for you for the
[1:00:56] song leader for me for everybody we on
[1:00:59] the same page and if you judge yourself
[1:01:01] already you will pass the inspection
[1:01:03] pretty much without any problem
[1:01:05] everybody okay so if you want to sing
[1:01:08] like three because the song leader
[1:01:10] usually have the their song like three
[1:01:12] days in advance and they send it in the
[1:01:15] cloud and all the musicians have it and
[1:01:17] the rehearse and everything so if you
[1:01:19] want to sing something go ahead and send
[1:01:21] it to the song leader let him handle it
[1:01:23] everybody okay
[1:01:25] everybody good so don't send your song
[1:01:28] at 10 40 when the service start at 11
[1:01:30] o'clock
[1:01:33] everybody okay
[1:01:34] so far everything we've been singing
[1:01:36] Here 97 of it was fine
[1:01:39] I didn't see any problem but because the
[1:01:42] question arises we want to deal with it
[1:01:44] everybody good so remember let's respect
[1:01:48] the order that has been placed I gave
[1:01:49] you three scripture yesterday about
[1:01:51] order and I have a fourth one
[1:01:54] if you want it next time I will give you
[1:01:57] the fourth scripture about order there
[1:01:59] is no way you can have a church without
[1:02:01] order there is no way you can have a
[1:02:03] home without order there is no way you
[1:02:06] can have a company without order

[1:05:13] work together okay I have noticed
[1:05:16] something online give me time because I
[1:05:18] have to lay out something that is very
[1:05:20] deep
[1:05:21] I have noticed online I don't know I
[1:05:24] believe probably all of you have noticed
[1:05:26] that people make uh take brother
[1:05:28] branham's coat
[1:05:30] and they probably will put brother
[1:05:32] Brandon pictures around it and they put
[1:05:34] a coat and they say it came from Brother
[1:05:36] Branham and they give you the message
[1:05:38] and they're usually beautiful sometimes
[1:05:40] they would take a picture of brother
[1:05:41] Branham or put a like a background like
[1:05:45] a design and make it look good and they
[1:05:47] say this code came from this message
[1:05:49] Discord and I usually see people posting
[1:05:52] them on the WhatsApp which is very good
[1:05:55] I saw it but there was a particular
[1:05:57] quote
[1:05:58] that are so been posted
[1:06:01] by someone and it's brother Branham
[1:06:04] and for some reason like usually
[1:06:09] uh sleep up from my time into social
[1:06:12] media
[1:06:14] patrolling as a pastor I have a quote
[1:06:18] for it I have a quote okay and then I
[1:06:21] saw the quote
[1:06:22] then I was interesting and when I read
[1:06:24] the quote something ring
[1:06:26] in me like right around them spoke
[1:06:29] something like this
[1:06:32] say wait a minute I never heard such a
[1:06:35] quote what is the code you want to know
[1:06:37] about it yes yes all right let's start
[1:06:40] glory to God
[1:06:43] amen this is the looks beautiful
[1:06:48] is that it
[1:06:50] that's the code everything look good the
[1:06:52] layout is good and someone put this to
[1:06:55] kinda maybe give a message to somebody
[1:06:58] online about the court or something that
[1:07:00] they were listening to the message and
[1:07:02] he caught them and they want to share so
[1:07:03] someone else will know
[1:07:05] and that was the quote that was put
[1:07:07] online
[1:07:09] and it was going on on WhatsApp and I
[1:07:11] picked up the code and according to the
[1:07:14] court
[1:07:15] brother Branham say a Charming woman
[1:07:18] he's one who maintains correct water
[1:07:22] uh you ready I will need you today my
[1:07:24] friend and walk like a lady she is an
[1:07:28] example of a jewel on Earth
[1:07:30] I like anything that is graceful I think
[1:07:34] that a woman who keeps her place and
[1:07:37] tried to be a lady is a sculpture of
[1:07:40] Honor where did this come from 50 seal
[1:07:44] from the fifth seal when I read this
[1:07:47] something rang the bell on me
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:53] if you look right here there is a word
[1:07:55] called Charming
[1:07:58] I want you to listen to this because
[1:08:00] sometimes we copy one another on social
[1:08:02] media somebody post something you like
[1:08:05] it you also pick it up and you go post
[1:08:07] it and somebody should see it from you
[1:08:09] pick it up and post and before you know
[1:08:11] it it's all over the world you need to
[1:08:13] be careful what you're posting everybody
[1:08:15] okay
[1:08:16] according to the person who put this up
[1:08:19] brother Branham used the word a Charming
[1:08:22] woman
[1:08:22] and if you notice again brother Branham
[1:08:25] say that is one who maintain correct
[1:08:28] posture
[1:08:30] everybody okay and there is also oh my
[1:08:34] God the devil the devil
[1:08:37] nobody else but the devil but too late
[1:08:40] my friend if you look again not even my
[1:08:43] anyway my friend because Jesus called
[1:08:46] Judah his friend but Judah was the devil
[1:08:49] but you're not really my friend
[1:08:52] everybody okay everybody okay okay
[1:08:54] so that a woman who keeps her place and
[1:08:59] tries to be a what lady is a water
[1:09:02] sculpture
[1:09:04] if you look there is a word saying
[1:09:07] Charming one say is one who maintain a
[1:09:10] correct word postures and the other ones
[1:09:13] say who keeps and another one says she's
[1:09:15] here
[1:09:16] when I saw the word Charming
[1:09:19] I say something is wrong
[1:09:23] I opened the message of database and I
[1:09:26] put the word Charming because they gave
[1:09:28] a reference of the fifth seal when I put
[1:09:31] the word Charming I pull it no quote is
[1:09:34] coming out
[1:09:36] I want you to be aware of this whoever
[1:09:39] is online who's not here
[1:09:41] I changed the word I put another word I
[1:09:44] pulled the code it's not working
[1:09:46] I said what's going on
[1:09:48] we need to wake up
[1:09:51] this message has been infiltrated
[1:09:54] everybody okay
[1:09:55] so I use
[1:09:58] different keys and finally I got the
[1:10:02] quote where it came from
[1:10:03] then I pulled the code this is the code
[1:10:07] everybody okay
[1:10:09] the court is the fifth seal everybody
[1:10:12] okay brother Branham says this you can
[1:10:15] verify the home the one on the computer

[1:13:33] seals and change it brother Barnum
[1:13:35] continue he say if you ever heard
[1:13:38] anything that is really as I can say it
[1:13:41] is how thus say the Lord get those
[1:13:45] those what tips on what on the seventh
[1:13:48] year how can you change something on the
[1:13:50] 17th
[1:13:52] in the message the souls that are in
[1:13:55] prison brother Branham say one of them
[1:13:57] he would not permit us to know we
[1:13:59] already talked about it how many was
[1:14:01] here at the Water Seven Seals and heard
[1:14:04] the congregation say what amen the
[1:14:07] seventh seal he would not permit it he
[1:14:10] stood right there in the room and
[1:14:11] revealed water everywhere every one of
[1:14:14] them every one of the seal and if I have
[1:14:17] if I ever preach anything in my life
[1:14:21] was inspired it was water that and he
[1:14:25] ought to be helped you to who to you
[1:14:30] don't temper with the seals and don't
[1:14:33] even temper with the message why
[1:14:36] brother Branham say
[1:14:38] now this is just a little service and it
[1:14:42] shall blend right in with it too so
[1:14:45] listen to water every word and do what
[1:14:48] catch it
[1:14:49] that's why we don't want you to change
[1:14:50] the words if you are taking it on tape
[1:14:54] or anything then you stay right with
[1:14:57] that water teaching don't say nothing
[1:15:04] but what the temple says just say just
[1:15:09] what exactly exactly what the tap did
[1:15:12] what says
[1:15:15] they're talking about a nice woman you
[1:15:17] put a Charming woman
[1:15:21] everybody okay we are going to now
[1:15:24] because some of these things we are
[1:15:26] going to understand a whole lot about
[1:15:28] this now why it is what misunderstood
[1:15:31] and you'll be sure to say just what the
[1:15:34] table says don't say what anything else
[1:15:37] now don't say what nothing else nothing
[1:15:40] else because I don't say that of my own
[1:15:49] who is him
[1:15:51] so when you changing word what are you
[1:15:54] doing
[1:15:57] um
[1:15:58] everybody okay it is him that says it so
[1:16:03] many times what confusion confusion
[1:16:05] people will raise up and say well so and
[1:16:08] so say and he means so and so let's just
[1:16:11] do whatever leave it just away in water
[1:16:13] is if you want to put a posting online
[1:16:16] coming from the message of the hour
[1:16:18] leave it the way brother Brandon spoke
[1:16:21] about it don't change even a grammatical
[1:16:25] error
[1:16:26] leave the arrow the way he was spoken
[1:16:30] don't change anything
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:34] they never gave you a commission to
[1:16:37] correct the message
[1:16:38] they gave you a commission to repeat the
[1:16:40] message
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:46] I don't know what's wrong with people
[1:16:51] irreverent
[1:16:52] let's go to our scripture
[1:17:00] if you know the caliber of brother
[1:17:02] Branham you should not even temper
[1:17:09] that's why you hear people saying
[1:17:11] brother Branham saying you go search
[1:17:12] there is no code why so and so say so
[1:17:15] and so say so and so say and then before

[1:55:13] Father Lord we are approaching you
[1:55:16] humbly again father this morning Lord
[1:55:19] thanking you for your grace your love
[1:55:21] and your mercy father and for everything
[1:55:23] you have been doing for us father I
[1:55:26] commit myself and this congregation unto
[1:55:28] the hand and those that are streaming
[1:55:30] Lord may you move me completely out of
[1:55:33] the way may you come and speak to your
[1:55:35] children in Jesus precious name amen
[1:55:40] my subject this morning yes
[1:55:43] is the four phases of roof
[1:55:46] the theophany and the power of the seed
[1:55:53] everybody okay the theophany and the
[1:55:57] power of the seed everybody okay
[1:56:01] we are in the threshing floor we're
[1:56:04] going back and forth between roof
[1:56:06] chapter 3 and roof chapter four because
[1:56:09] when Ruth came into Israel even though
[1:56:13] she was living in Israel she was not yet
[1:56:16] into the congregation of Israel
[1:56:19] she was just a stranger in the land of
[1:56:22] Israel everybody good but in between
[1:56:25] roof chapter 3 after midnight and Ruth
[1:56:29] chapter four when the work of redemption
[1:56:31] is completed among the Elder now roof
[1:56:34] was legally
[1:56:37] everybody okay recognize as a
[1:56:41] citizenship
[1:56:42] as a citizen of the nation of Israel in
[1:56:46] other words Israel became a nation of
[1:56:50] roof even though Israel was already a
[1:56:54] nation of roof by her choosing that's
[1:56:56] right
[1:56:59] because roof say my people your people
[1:57:02] will be my people your God will be my
[1:57:05] god when you die I will do what when
[1:57:07] they bury you I will do water she
[1:57:09] already expressed that but it was not
[1:57:12] sanctioned yet
[1:57:14] you have to be sanctioned by the work of
[1:57:17] redemption before their Elder was it
[1:57:20] sanctioned then Ruth brought the baby
[1:57:22] Obed you saw him in the genealogy
[1:57:24] everybody okay what we are talking about
[1:57:27] in the Tabernacle is that God open a way
[1:57:31] that a Believer who cannot access the
[1:57:35] presence of God can go through steps
[1:57:38] until he can give access to the glory of
[1:57:42] God
[1:57:43] because all have sinned
[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:47] they were short of the glory of who God
[1:57:50] but because of Calvary the right of the
[1:57:54] temple the veil was rented into country
[1:57:57] opened the way so that we can get access
[1:58:00] to the Living God and once you are in
[1:58:03] his presence he begin to prepare you for
[1:58:06] the going away which is called The
[1:58:08] Rapture but this morning we are entering
[1:58:11] the abstiophany and the power of the
[1:58:14] seed what is going on with this seed
[1:58:19] last Sunday
[1:58:20] we found out that that seed
[1:58:24] amen amen is really called a thought
[1:58:31] everybody okay and that thought brother
[1:58:34] called that the word
[1:58:37] amen because what the problem said we do
[1:58:41] not believe in the pre-existence of
[1:58:44] Souls
[1:58:45] everybody okay a soul is created but I'm
[1:58:49] saying what pre-existed what always
[1:58:52] existed of you is the word or the
[1:58:57] thought or the seed
[1:59:02] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:59:05] brother Branham says this as a
[1:59:08] recapitulation he says that leader is
[1:59:12] sad of the inside that is why you ought
[1:59:15] to start which is called your water so
[1:59:17] then you come from that you are a water
[1:59:20] spirit and then you become a what a
[1:59:22] living being and we found out that when
[1:59:24] God creates you
[1:59:26] amen
[1:59:28] God started with you as a soul
[1:59:32] everybody good
[1:59:33] this has a beginning
[1:59:37] everybody okay and everything that has a
[1:59:39] beginning has a water and then from a
[1:59:42] soul God gives you a human Spirit
[1:59:45] remember last Sunday amen because you
[1:59:49] are human being then from a human being
[1:59:51] God gives you a body or a flesh
[1:59:56] amen so that the spirit can dwell into
[2:00:00] the body because James say the body
[2:00:02] without the spirit is what everybody
[2:00:05] okay we've seen before that these two
[2:00:09] components
[2:00:10] amen is the invisible you
[2:00:17] everybody okay it is called The Inside
[2:00:20] Man
[2:00:23] Paul also called that the enemy
[2:00:27] everybody okay and this which is called
[2:00:30] the body this is the visible part of you
[2:00:34] which is the outside man
[2:00:39] amen
[2:00:40] so the body that we have that we see one
[2:00:43] another this morning is only a contender
[2:00:48] only a vehicle
[2:00:50] only a government that the spiritual man
[2:00:54] will enter in
[2:00:58] everybody okay but all of this is not
[2:01:01] eternal
[2:01:05] glory to God
[2:01:07] everybody okay
[2:01:08] but now brother brought them say they
[2:01:11] you that always existed is not this one
[2:01:16] because this one is created
[2:01:19] this one is created this one you gotta
[2:01:22] wait till your mother and your father
[2:01:24] are married for you to get it
[2:01:27] everybody okay everybody good but the
[2:01:31] you that always existed
[2:01:34] is the word
[2:01:39] or the seed
[2:01:42] of their thoughts
[2:01:46] are the attribute
[2:01:49] it's saying the same thing
[2:01:51] everybody okay
[2:01:53] being the word because this spiritual
[2:01:57] man here
[2:01:58] amen
[2:02:03] this is the natural man
[2:02:06] everybody clear because this spiritual
[2:02:09] man must have a body to live on amen
[2:02:14] the word also must have also its own
[2:02:18] body
[2:02:21] that's why brother Branham in the
[2:02:24] message who is Melissa they can give it
[2:02:26] to you brother Branham said that to your
[2:02:28] funny is the word body
[2:02:32] amen you remember that brother Branham
[2:02:36] said that to your family is the word
[2:02:38] body in other words that you're funny is
[2:02:41] the body that is there to receive the
[2:02:44] word
[2:02:46] is amen let me start it again
[2:02:49] this one is a body
[2:02:53] the body of the word the body of the
[2:02:57] seed the body of the thought the body of
[2:03:01] the attribute because the correct way is
[2:03:05] you must go from the word to the tea of
[2:03:07] honey then you get into flesh
[2:03:09] these two things here are
[2:03:13] eternal
[2:03:15] [Music]
[2:03:17] everybody okay According to second
[2:03:21] Corinthians to your funny are in heaven
[2:03:23] they are eternal according to the seed
[2:03:27] by the Branham the word you who are
[2:03:30] eternal
[2:03:31] everybody okay
[2:03:33] what happened because we bypass our tea
[2:03:36] often we saw three rings
[2:03:39] everybody remember you got the body here
[2:03:43] I'm right here
[2:03:44] we got the spirit here everybody there
[2:03:48] and we got the soul there everybody
[2:03:50] there then in the soul here because you
[2:03:54] bypass your theophany everybody okay you
[2:03:57] were supposed to go this way because you
[2:04:00] didn't go this way God take you and put
[2:04:03] you right here
[2:04:05] again that's right as a seed
[2:04:10] or a germ
[2:04:12] everybody good so far in the Tabernacle
[2:04:16] we see you as a body which is the other
[2:04:21] court we see you as the holy place and
[2:04:25] we see you as the holiest
[2:04:27] and by the badam said this is the soul
[2:04:30] this is the spirit
[2:04:32] and this is the body
[2:04:35] amen and we found out last Sunday that
[2:04:39] you have an ark of the covenant here and
[2:04:41] the Ark has a throne right here where
[2:04:44] God will come and sit on this Throne
[2:04:47] everybody okay so far
[2:04:50] this is very important because it goes
[2:04:53] with the new birth
[2:04:55] we found out on Sunday that when God
[2:04:58] getting you or when God come in the
[2:05:01] Tabernacle he's looking for his seat
[2:05:05] he's looking for his turn
[2:05:08] and if God doesn't find his throne amen

[2:09:07] [Applause]
[2:09:11] let me lay it down I got back up I got
[2:09:15] quote everybody okay when this man get
[2:09:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:09:21] Ghost will get into him but he doesn't
[2:09:24] see anywhere to put the ankle
[2:09:27] [Applause]
[2:09:29] do you follow me then the Holy Ghost
[2:09:32] will leave
[2:09:34] because there is no throne and the Holy
[2:09:37] Ghost come out but he got the baptism of
[2:09:40] the Holy Ghost but he will not produce
[2:09:43] their life
[2:09:44] [Applause]
[2:09:48] Have I Lost You
[2:09:54] please give me time
[2:09:56] that's why you see people going through
[2:09:59] emotion in the message but there is no
[2:10:02] changes 20 years there's no change we
[2:10:05] gotta know what is in you
[2:10:09] [Applause]
[2:10:14] everybody okay because what is inside is
[2:10:19] a germ seed you need to be quickened
[2:10:22] when it's quickened it will begin to
[2:10:25] grow
[2:10:26] and produce a Son of God are a daughter
[2:10:29] of God
[2:10:30] [Applause]
[2:10:35] father help me
[2:10:38] brother Branham say you can't think with
[2:10:41] your body you think with your what mine
[2:10:43] in there there is this there is where
[2:10:47] too many of Christians only do what
[2:10:50] stuff and they can just like a corn in
[2:10:54] the field and the weed in the field they
[2:10:57] can be anointed
[2:11:00] are you following me with the same water
[2:11:04] Holy Spirit that's the real believer is
[2:11:07] what Anointed with you need to be
[2:11:09] careful in this message
[2:11:10] [Applause]
[2:11:11] the Holy Ghost can do the same thing on
[2:11:14] you
[2:11:15] that he does to the other person
[2:11:17] everybody okay but the problem goes now
[2:11:20] but down on the water inside of that
[2:11:24] what the problem say the problem is what
[2:11:26] is in the soul
[2:11:30] father Stephen you're saying somebody
[2:11:33] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:35] hold on
[2:11:37] he said but down on the water inside of
[2:11:40] that the north next wheel which is the
[2:11:43] third way and the third worm is water in
[2:11:47] the Tabernacle it is the holiest
[2:11:50] is the water so and that is
[2:11:53] predestinated by who God there is what
[2:11:57] the water will see germs
[2:12:00] is in there
[2:12:05] so you can receive the holy ghost in
[2:12:08] your flesh no problem
[2:12:11] you can receive the Holy Ghost going
[2:12:13] through your spirit no problem you can
[2:12:16] even have the Holy Ghost in your soul
[2:12:18] is still not enough
[2:12:21] the soul must have the seed of life
[2:12:25] [Applause]
[2:12:28] if there is no seed of life that baptism
[2:12:31] will do you nothing
[2:12:33] [Applause]
[2:12:35] that's the truth
[2:12:38] Have I Lost You
[2:12:40] William Marion Branham
[2:12:43] oh God help me Father brother Bonham say
[2:12:47] you can be anointed where out here in
[2:12:51] the water spirit and the desire and do
[2:12:54] all desire the water things but when it
[2:12:56] comes to this type of that to that word
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:03] what is the word seed you shall never
[2:13:08] move from water there is
[2:13:15] it can be outside of that regardless of
[2:13:19] what you do you are still lost
[2:13:22] message believe and wake up
[2:13:25] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:13:28] what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[2:13:34] 1965 after the seals brother Branham
[2:13:38] saying you can be anointed he can get
[2:13:40] into that but if there is nothing there
[2:13:43] in other words they predestinated seed
[2:13:46] is a catch
[2:13:49] for the Holy Ghost
[2:13:51] I don't know if you get me if the Holy
[2:13:55] Ghost get into you you must have a
[2:13:58] goalkeeper
[2:13:59] amen as soon as the Holy Ghost come they
[2:14:03] predestined the seed get him
[2:14:06] and don't let him go
[2:14:09] Holy Ghost this is your house
[2:14:12] you gonna stay here you're not going
[2:14:15] nowhere
[2:14:16] [Applause]
[2:14:22] [Music]
[2:14:24] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:26] this is the true baptism of the Holy
[2:14:31] Ghost
[2:14:33] that's why brother Branham said
[2:14:35] justification make way to water
[2:14:37] scientification sanctification make
[2:14:39] white water
[2:14:40] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost make
[2:14:44] white water holy ghosts itself the Holy
[2:14:47] Ghost himself
[2:14:52] everybody okay
[2:14:54] you can chew me to my friend
[2:14:57] you can shoot me to my friend
[2:15:00] if you stay in tune God will give you
[2:15:03] the Holy Ghost without me laying hand on
[2:15:06] you
[2:15:06] because the Holy Ghost when he came in
[2:15:09] the Gentile the first time nobody lay
[2:15:12] hand on them
[2:15:14] at the preaching of the word the Holy
[2:15:16] Spirit baptized the people
[2:15:19] [Music]
[2:15:21] why do we have so much missing the
[2:15:23] message
[2:15:26] can I continue brother Barnum say they
[2:15:29] allowed this in churches naked blind and
[2:15:32] what miserable don't even know follow me
[2:15:35] carefully I beg you it is that anointed
[2:15:39] Anointed with the water real Spirit the
[2:15:43] Holy Spirit can fall Upon A man in water
[2:15:45] his Spirit but his soul is his water
[2:15:49] that jam is the what word
[2:15:54] the Holy Spirit does and look for you
[2:16:03] the holy spirit is looking for the you
[2:16:07] that is inside
[2:16:10] if that you is not there
[2:16:15] everybody okay but the problem say I
[2:16:18] don't care how much you can do and
[2:16:20] preach
[2:16:22] how well you do this how much you can
[2:16:25] water love
[2:16:26] [Applause]
[2:16:32] I love God I love God I love God we
[2:16:37] don't care how much you can love
[2:16:40] Jesus loved the rich young woman but he
[2:16:44] went to hell
[2:16:44] [Applause]
[2:16:50] I hope whoever is missing today will be
[2:16:55] listening to this
[2:16:56] because we got to the time that Jesus is
[2:16:59] coming
[2:17:00] we must go in the Rapture I don't want
[2:17:03] to stay here one of this day you're
[2:17:05] gonna come you won't see me preaching
[2:17:07] just know I'm already gone
[2:17:09] you will have service yourself you will
[2:17:13] keep this building yourself I will be
[2:17:15] gone
[2:17:17] everybody will care everybody okay if
[2:17:20] you want to hold on to the building
[2:17:21] that's your problem when Jesus come and
[2:17:23] leave everything you will find a new
[2:17:26] pastor not me
[2:17:29] [Applause]
[2:17:31] so if you're playing around with church
[2:17:33] now that's your problem
[2:17:40] that is one of the inlet of the water
[2:17:44] spirit you can love with that with your
[2:17:47] water body you love with your water
[2:17:50] spirit that is one of the water inlet
[2:17:52] and you can laugh
[2:17:59] are you ready and even love good God
[2:18:06] and still not be water why
[2:18:09] how can you love God and being but not
[2:18:12] right
[2:18:13] I'm giving you time so you can swallow
[2:18:16] how can you love God and you're not
[2:18:18] right
[2:18:24] oh brother Stephen he's a good singer he
[2:18:27] said he love God
[2:18:31] ah because he told you I love God
[2:18:34] because he's singing I love God
[2:18:37] you can even love who God and still not
[2:18:40] be water why you can cast out what
[2:18:43] devils and do what preach and do this
[2:18:45] thing and still not be what why Jesus
[2:18:48] said so he said many will come in that
[2:18:50] day that word
[2:18:53] is the seed
[2:18:56] thank you
[2:18:57] oh my
[2:18:59] god father help me glory to God he said
[2:19:03] we found today that people there is many
[2:19:06] people that just can't believe it even
[2:19:08] Water Seven
[2:19:10] even what spirit filled people
[2:19:15] I'm going to give you one brother Kalima
[2:19:20] that's how to watch
[2:19:25] what is he brother Branham they brought
[2:19:28] this mouth the water Holy Ghost doesn't
[2:19:31] mean you are water going in
[2:19:34] let's stop right there if I didn't show
[2:19:37] you this
[2:19:39] how are you going to understand this
[2:19:40] quote
[2:19:42] we're telling people they need to be
[2:19:44] baptized with the Holy Ghost a preacher
[2:19:47] comes and give you this how are you
[2:19:49] gonna know it if I didn't show you that
[2:19:53] why is brother Branham saying that you
[2:19:56] can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:58] and be lost
[2:20:00] when we tell you if you got the baptism
[2:20:02] of the Holy Ghost you go into the
[2:20:03] Rapture is where the brand I'm
[2:20:05] contradicting push the break on the
[2:20:07] prophet
[2:20:09] everybody okay why remember what I
[2:20:12] showed you
[2:20:13] the Holy Ghost can get here he can get
[2:20:16] here he can baptize you but even though
[2:20:20] he baptized you when he baptized baptism
[2:20:23] is like they're putting you under in
[2:20:26] other words the Holy Ghost is taking
[2:20:28] over your soul when he enter your soul
[2:20:31] he's inspecting the soul
[2:20:33] he's looking for something and then over
[2:20:36] there you might be rolling on the floor
[2:20:38] and everything that's not a problem if
[2:20:40] that seed
[2:20:42] is not there the Holy Ghost will go back
[2:20:46] again slowly and pull from your spirit
[2:20:50] and pull from your body and say this is
[2:20:53] not my child
[2:20:55] and tomorrow you wake up you go and your
[2:20:58] life doesn't change
[2:21:02] everybody okay because baptized baptized
[2:21:07] the difference is there
[2:21:10] that's why brother Branham is saying you
[2:21:13] can get baptized and still be lost why
[2:21:16] because there is nothing
[2:21:21] how do I know something is in me
[2:21:25] can I continue spoken with you grown up
[2:21:28] my friend you got a true hard food okay
[2:21:31] if I give you milk you need mussels now
[2:21:34] okay uh we need to change the diet a
[2:21:37] little bit okay glory to God the baptism
[2:21:41] of the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you are
[2:21:42] water going in not at all not on that
[2:21:46] don't have anything to do with your what
[2:21:49] so
[2:21:53] that is the water baptism here is there
[2:21:57] is sad so in here that has to come from
[2:22:02] water God but they all then on the
[2:22:05] outside you have water five senses your
[2:22:08] body you contact your every home the
[2:22:11] inside you have water spirit and in
[2:22:13] there you have father let your
[2:22:15] conscience your love and so forth have
[2:22:17] led to the water spirit remember
