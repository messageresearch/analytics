[40:05] the foundation you are blank
[40:09] how can you be in this message and
[40:11] always read the book of Psalms
[40:15] I don't know where that one comes
[40:18] amen and it's the evening book before

[40:24] search for the shortest song so we can
[40:26] read that quickly and go to bed
[40:29] in the message 30 years and you're

[40:33] bride I'm the bride do you know where

[40:49] one year you cannot finish two sermons
[40:52] to start to finish you cannot
[40:58] let's talk about politics
[41:00] and you will see how much people know
[41:06] amen okay that's wonderful that's the
[41:10] way I want Genesis chapter 2 if you dare
[41:13] you can say a man verse 21.
[41:18] the devil is not playing games now
[41:22] okay either you have God or you will see
[41:27] and the devil will prove to you that you
[41:30] don't have God
[41:32] okay
[41:34] so this church is not the message church
[41:37] where you come do your religion and you
[41:40] go
[41:41] I'm not here for that one I'm not here
[41:44] to get you here and then we finish we go
[41:47] to fellowship and begin to to joke and
[41:50] to play games and tomorrow again we get
[41:53] used to one another
[41:54] and we're in trouble
[41:56] I've seen all of that
[41:58] so that Tech game is over
[42:01] amen glory to God verse 21 and the Lord
[42:05] God calls a deep sleep you understand
[42:07] this now to fall upon Adam and he slept
[42:14] and he took one of his weebs and closed
[42:17] up the flesh instead thereof
[42:19] so Eve could not be made without a
[42:22] portion of Adam
[42:24] we okay now clear
[42:27] verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God
[42:30] has taken from man
[42:32] made he a woman and brought her to man
[42:37] and Adam says this is now born of my
[42:42] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[42:46] called woman because she was taken out
[42:49] of man you might be seated so what we
[42:53] are looking at here again in Genesis
[42:56] chapter 2 is that God took a part of
[42:59] Adam
[43:01] amen which was a rib and from that rib
[43:06] God built a material
[43:09] everybody okay on top of this rib and
[43:13] when the material that was added onto
[43:16] the rib were completed they look like
[43:19] Adam
[43:25] when Adam looked at Eve Adam said this
[43:28] is not what
[43:30] and Flesh of My Water in other words Eve
[43:33] look like me the only difference between
[43:36] Adam and Eve is the gender
[43:41] Eve was a female a woman and Adam was a
[43:45] man but the the the material the body
[43:48] material the flesh the bond the sinew
[43:52] the muscles everything that was used on
[43:54] Adam was exactly identical to what Eve
[43:59] anybody okay so to build the Bride of
[44:03] Adam God needed first a portion of Adam
[44:08] everybody okay everybody okay and from
[44:12] that portion of Adam God begin to add
[44:16] more portions that look like Adam
[44:23] everybody okay so when Eve was finished
[44:26] Eve was nothing else but Adam in a
[44:29] female version
[44:32] everybody okay even the anatomy of Eve
[44:36] matches Adam
[44:38] I will get to that in a separate room
[44:41] with the young man the young sisters and
[44:43] everything and I will show you how God
[44:45] worked that up
[44:48] that's why when you get married you
[44:50] become one
[44:54] okay blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:57] let's go to Colossians chapter one
[44:59] Hallelujah
[45:04] there is a lot we need to learn in this
[45:06] message
[45:09] amen
[45:11] amen
[45:14] why was Eve made the way she was made
[45:19] Adam was a man why didn't God create Eve
[45:23] like like a man why did he change the
[45:27] morphology of Eve do you think he was
[45:29] just like that
[45:32] no if you understand this thing it will
[45:35] save you headache in marriage
[45:43] in other words he gathered so thin
[45:46] pretty good amen
[45:52] uh what do they say appointment
[45:54] Rendezvous on the 17th
[45:57] we will talk
[45:59] let's go in Colossians 1 verse 15. I
[46:03] will take the scripture and I will buy
[46:05] and and I will climb with the scripture
[46:09] whatever is written in this Bible will
[46:11] will will I measure everything is in
[46:15] this Bible it depends on how you read it
[46:17] Colossians 1 verse 15.
[46:24] so Eve
[46:26] have a portion of Adam
[46:28] and then the remaining of the material
[46:31] looks exactly like Adam
[46:36] so the bread must be made that way
[46:39] if you are True Blood of God God have to
[46:42] cut a portion of himself
[46:46] and put in you and from that portion God
[46:49] need to add more material to that
[46:52] portion according to where you were cut
[46:57] if you were cut from a wood they cannot
[47:01] add anything else but wood
[47:04] everybody okay if you were cut from a
[47:07] concrete God cannot add anything to you
[47:09] but concrete if you were cut from deity
[47:18] everybody okay everybody okay so God
[47:21] cannot add anything else but what he's
[47:24] adding is still deity
[47:28] because only deity will blend with deity
[47:33] it's the image of Daniel that have the
[47:36] clay and the ion it's two different
[47:39] material and it doesn't stick together
[47:45] everybody okay
[47:47] Colossians 1 verse 15 glory to God
[47:51] the Bible said who is the image of the
[47:56] invisible God you know what he means now
[47:58] the firstborn of every creature
[48:02] for by him
[48:04] where all things created that are in
[48:08] heaven and that are in Earth
[48:11] visible and invisible whether they be
[48:14] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[48:18] or Powers all things were created by Him
[48:22] and for him you need to understand these
[48:26] principles
[48:27] because God will not give you his power
[48:30] for you to make a play with it
[48:33] when you want to create something you
[48:36] have to be created for him
[48:42] glory to God Amen verse 17 and he is
[48:46] before all things you understand this
[48:49] and by him all things do water
[48:53] so all things hold together by him let's
[48:56] see how far we will go today if I will
[48:58] reach there let's go to Hebrew chapter
[49:00] 11.
[49:03] my friend is not here and he's postal
[49:05] duty this morning so brother Caleb hand
[49:09] the microphone to brother Benjamin
[49:12] amen I want to hear those big men voices
[49:15] like dirty that's what I want to hear
[49:19] foreign
[49:24] so you need to roar like a lion like a
[49:28] true lion
[49:29] amen
[49:30] Hebrew chapter 11 verse 1. if you dare
[49:33] you can say Amen
[49:36] verse 1 now Faith
[49:39] you there brother Benjamin okay is the
[49:42] substance of things hopeful
[49:46] so there is a hope
[49:49] first you hoping for something but hope
[49:52] doesn't get you nowhere
[49:54] you are still hoping as long as it's a
[49:57] hope it will be your dream
[50:00] like you hear people say my dream house
[50:05] everybody okay it's still a dream you
[50:08] are still hoping amen but it's not
[50:11] crystallized yet
[50:13] everybody okay
[50:15] everybody okay for whatever you have to
[50:18] live your dream
[50:20] and to begin to calm the sand down to
[50:24] becoming reality you must fund or you
[50:27] must channel that into faith everything
[50:31] when it's in faith even though you don't
[50:35] see it with your eyes it's already
[50:37] existed
[50:41] is it complicated
[50:46] we have the Realms of hopes
[50:49] Amen Let Me Circle it this way hope need
[50:54] to drop into faith
[50:57] amen and let me Circle this like this
[51:00] and Faith now will drop into reality
[51:05] or into materialization
[51:10] everybody okay so if you have uh
[51:16] I'm just gonna pick up
[51:18] if you have a car here
[51:21] everybody okay you can hope for this car
[51:25] all you want
[51:28] you can dream for this car all you want
[51:31] everybody okay if this car doesn't move
[51:34] from here into here you will never have
[51:36] it
[51:39] we're talking about the deity material
[51:42] okay once whatever car you have here
[51:45] jump into this thing this is imaginary
[51:49] this is where you make stuff
[51:52] okay you can make a project
[51:54] and put it right here it is still a
[51:57] project it's still a hope
[52:00] you are built like God
[52:06] this is your imagination
[52:10] everybody okay this is your design room
[52:17] are we okay
[52:18] this is your design room here you have
[52:22] to design it everybody okay and when you
[52:25] design something you have to go through
[52:28] inspection
[52:33] everybody okay
[52:35] if we design a plan like we're designing
[52:37] the fellowship right here the fellowship
[52:39] hall everybody okay you have to go
[52:42] through the engineering and they look at
[52:44] everything amen and they send it to the
[52:48] city to the county to be able to receive
[52:51] a stamp on it
[52:53] amen if your project is not according to
[52:57] the laws of duncani they send it back to
[53:01] the engineer they say you missing uh two
[53:04] screws here you're missing a tree here
[53:07] you're missing this this here and the
[53:10] engineering have to work again according
[53:12] to the law
[53:13] everybody okay so when you are designing
[53:16] your house where you are designing your
[53:19] fellowship hall you must design the
[53:22] fellowship hall according to the laws of
[53:25] the coming
[53:27] amen
[53:28] everybody okay when you are designing
[53:32] your future
[53:34] [Applause]
[53:37] why is it difficult when I tell you
[53:39] stuff about God
[53:42] everybody okay it's easy to tell you God
[53:44] will bless you God will bless you God
[53:46] will love God will protect you and then
[53:49] get you pumped up
[53:51] amen amen you need to create your own
[53:55] blessings
[53:58] everybody okay but when you are making
[54:01] your blessing you must have the laws
[54:08] amen
[54:09] that's why the Bible say if we ask
[54:12] anything
[54:13] according to his will
[54:17] so make sure whatever you're asking is
[54:20] matching his plan
[54:22] once he matches his plan then the
[54:26] architect will approve it
[54:29] everybody okay when it's approved it's
[54:32] no longer a hope
[54:33] he jumped into the favor
[54:36] everybody okay when it's first it's the
[54:39] time now for you to speak it
[54:42] this is not the time for you to get
[54:45] prepared to receive it
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:53] why do you want the house you want
[54:58] why do you want it like that
[55:00] why do you want a design yeah what is
[55:03] the motive behind it
[55:05] what are you trying to accomplish
[55:08] amen and if you get it what are you
[55:11] going to do with it
[55:12] [Applause]
[55:13] are you going to stay humble
[55:17] or are you gonna start posting that on
[55:20] WhatsApp
[55:23] Are You Gonna Keep Your prophecy
[55:26] or you will begin to take picture of
[55:29] even your bathroom
[55:31] what are you going to do with that
[55:33] housing when you pass that test
[55:37] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[55:40] okay once you drop in the realm of
[55:44] faithful even if your bank account is
[55:46] negative
[55:56] if you have five hundred thousand
[55:58] dollars do you need Faith also
[56:05] you're fooling yourself
[56:07] everybody okay you don't need faith for
[56:10] that
[56:10] but the Seed of Abraham can cause things
[56:14] that are not
[56:20] everybody okay and begin to pull those
[56:23] things down until those things become
[56:26] material
[56:30] so what we are trying to do is to turn
[56:33] your God engine on
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:40] everybody okay
[56:42] everybody okay
[56:47] Hebrew chapter one if you're waiting for
[56:49] me to tell you something like oh faith
[56:51] is coming forth is coming that's why you
[56:53] miss it
[56:56] that's why we miss it who told you your
[56:58] car is going to crank this morning
[57:02] who told you that
[57:04] amen when you went to bed you knew I'm
[57:07] gonna be in church this morning and it
[57:10] happened how did it happen
[57:12] as simple as that happened that is as
[57:15] simple as everything can happen
[57:19] the problem is this man and his genetics
[57:22] and his environment and his education
[57:27] he want even God to channel his word
[57:31] according to his intellect
[57:34] for him to be for him to receive it
[57:40] God look at Gideon he say money man of
[57:43] Allah
[57:44] and Gideon maybe look at this
[57:47] say I don't have money you who are you
[57:49] talking to
[57:50] you talking to me
[57:55] amen because according to us Gideon
[57:58] should be exercising every morning have
[58:00] six packs and everything so when God
[58:03] said Mighty Men of father he said yes
[58:05] here I am
[58:06] God won't use you
[58:11] because you got too much strength
[58:17] do you know what he did to Israel when
[58:19] the Army was big he said if they go to
[58:23] war they win the war they will say
[58:25] because we were too big
[58:28] everybody okay when they take the
[58:30] medication they begin to give more
[58:32] credit to the medication than me
[58:34] oh when I take that medication it always
[58:37] work
[58:38] so when do we have a headache the self
[58:41] is telling no
[58:43] Talent or get more credit than God
[58:49] that's why you're telling them sometimes
[58:51] don't work
[58:54] and now you go to the medical doctor to
[58:57] give you something stronger
[58:59] and you brag about it oh man you take
[59:01] this one it works
[59:04] why you don't brag about God
[59:09] why you don't brag about God
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:12] because you don't have experiences with
[59:14] it
[59:15] you have experiences with Tylenol
[59:21] free of charge body now Faith is the
[59:25] substance of things water
[59:28] the evidence of fixed water in other
[59:31] words even though you have not seen it
[59:33] yet faith is declaring that it's there
[59:37] amen once this Faith here begin to
[59:40] declare that it's there that's it
[59:44] it's just a matter of time how it's
[59:47] going to happen that's not your problem
[59:49] verse 2 for buy it by faith
[59:53] the elders obtain a good water so if you
[59:58] want to have a good report what do you
[1:00:00] need
[1:00:04] let's continue the first three through
[1:00:07] faith that's why you heard Paul saying
[1:00:09] we heard the battery of faith in the
[1:00:11] Lord go read the scripture of Paul
[1:00:14] he was uh talking either to colossian or
[1:00:17] somebody said we heard about your faith
[1:00:21] it was the report of their faith what
[1:00:23] God is doing in their midst amen verse 3
[1:00:27] through faith
[1:00:29] ready
[1:00:30] through the second set here through here
[1:00:33] so you gotta go through here amen
[1:00:35] through faith amen
[1:00:39] we understand that the world's plural
[1:00:44] were framed by the water the word of God
[1:00:47] by the word of God in other words before
[1:00:50] God spoke The World God have to believe
[1:00:55] himself
[1:01:01] okay
[1:01:03] true faith we understand in other words
[1:01:07] what was God creating with now Paul is
[1:01:11] describing that what God was using to
[1:01:14] create he was channeling everything
[1:01:16] through faith
[1:01:19] when he Channel through faith God was
[1:01:21] making the world in other words God was
[1:01:24] speaking believing what he's speaking
[1:01:28] that is where perfect faith is it will
[1:01:31] never miss
[1:01:32] he says through faith we understand that
[1:01:36] the worlds were framed by the word of
[1:01:39] God so that things which are water
[1:01:45] let me call this one
[1:01:49] amen whatever exists or that you see in
[1:01:53] through here
[1:01:54] amen before he was here he was first
[1:01:58] here
[1:02:04] amen you might have a project to never
[1:02:07] accomplish it
[1:02:10] but there are certain projects that will
[1:02:12] come to pass
[1:02:13] amen it depends on where it's coming
[1:02:16] from
[1:02:17] amen
[1:02:18] we understand that the words were framed
[1:02:22] by the word of God so that things which
[1:02:24] are seen natural naked eye were not made
[1:02:29] of things which do water so your
[1:02:33] material was not made out of a material
[1:02:36] your material was made by something that
[1:02:39] you cannot see yet it will
[1:02:42] that thing is what we call Faith
[1:02:46] amen it is a substance
[1:02:48] amen once you can touch something by
[1:02:51] faith that's it
[1:02:53] if faith can declare something it means
[1:02:57] that thing is there
[1:03:01] in other words whatever you want to know
[1:03:04] if he belongs to you go through the
[1:03:07] channel of faith
[1:03:09] use the hand of Faith to palpate the
[1:03:12] promises of God
[1:03:15] do you follow me he first get a hold of
[1:03:19] something and say Hey brother brother
[1:03:22] Jim whatever
[1:03:24] there is something here ask Faith what
[1:03:27] is it
[1:03:28] amen if first say it is this that say it
[1:03:31] belongs to you
[1:03:36] let's pray
[1:03:38] Heavenly Father
[1:03:39] Lord we are approaching you humbly again
[1:03:42] this morning Father we thank you once

[1:11:48] everybody okay everybody okay glory be
[1:11:52] to the name of the Lord oh my God we are
[1:11:56] deep deep
[1:11:58] into roof chapter four
[1:12:00] and we are dealing with the last phase
[1:12:02] of roof which is the departure of roof
[1:12:05] and the changing of Tabernacle because
[1:12:08] we started from justification unto
[1:12:11] sanctification from sanctification to
[1:12:13] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and from
[1:12:16] their roof need to change their mention
[1:12:18] and go into a different dimension
[1:12:22] if you recall in the Book of Revelation
[1:12:24] chapter 4 when John was taken out
[1:12:28] or apple which brother Branham said John
[1:12:31] was the top of the bride and by John
[1:12:33] being caught up in Revelation 4 brother
[1:12:36] Barnum said he was the top of the
[1:12:37] rapture
[1:12:40] everybody okay everybody okay because
[1:12:42] the word rapture is not in the Bible
[1:12:46] the word used is to be caught up
[1:12:49] so John was caught up in Revelation 4
[1:12:52] and if when was soon as he entered
[1:12:55] Heaven the first thing that he saw was a
[1:12:58] throne
[1:13:01] everybody okay why the throne
[1:13:05] everybody clear because in the last age
[1:13:08] of the Gentile
[1:13:09] in the laodicea age it is promised to
[1:13:13] the overcomer
[1:13:19] everybody okay let's go to revelation 3.
[1:13:23] [Music]
[1:13:25] let's go to Revelation 3 my friend
[1:13:31] I'm still climbing just about to break
[1:13:34] the sun bear
[1:13:38] if you dare you can say man the last
[1:13:41] Church the age of the Gentile the last
[1:13:44] one what is God promising to the
[1:13:47] overcoming of that age
[1:13:52] did you see that Revelation chapter 3
[1:13:55] let's go to verse 21.
[1:13:58] aha
[1:14:00] somebody saw it
[1:14:02] everybody okay
[1:14:05] Revelation is mathematically placed
[1:14:13] this Bible got math this Bible got
[1:14:15] biology he got even macrobiology
[1:14:19] he got geometry it teaches you the
[1:14:22] pyramid and everything
[1:14:27] wait till we get to that amen
[1:14:30] everybody good verse 21 to him that the
[1:14:33] water
[1:14:35] overcometh
[1:14:37] we like going to do it
[1:14:39] with me in mind
[1:14:43] why are you sitting on the throne of God
[1:14:47] how many of us are here
[1:14:50] how all of us are going to sit on one
[1:14:53] throne
[1:14:56] everybody okay
[1:14:58] what do you do with a throne
[1:15:01] when you sit for your only Throne what
[1:15:03] do you have to do who are you
[1:15:10] so the age of laodicea is preparing
[1:15:14] Kings
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:18] the Lord is your message is a message
[1:15:21] that is building rulers
[1:15:25] [Applause]
[1:15:27] it is building people that will be
[1:15:31] winning
[1:15:32] people that will be given command
[1:15:37] everybody okay
[1:15:39] and they will reign not smaller than God
[1:15:46] am I reading a different Bible they will
[1:15:50] win like God
[1:15:53] because you have been granted to sit on
[1:15:56] the throne of God let this man be in
[1:16:00] water that was also in who right that he
[1:16:04] thought not robbery to be watered with
[1:16:07] who ah
[1:16:09] yes
[1:16:11] yes not in any age only loudly such a
[1:16:15] change
[1:16:16] everybody okay everybody good is it
[1:16:19] clear okay the Bible said to him that
[1:16:22] overcometh we are going to sit with me
[1:16:25] in mind even as I also have done water
[1:16:29] and I'm set down in and I'm set down
[1:16:32] with my father in his water
[1:16:36] jump to Revelation 4 verse 1. after this
[1:16:40] I look and behold the water
[1:16:42] was open in water and the first voice
[1:16:46] which I heard was as he were a water
[1:16:49] talking with me which said
[1:16:52] and I will show you things which must
[1:16:55] come water
[1:16:56] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:17:00] behold a water so the first thing that
[1:17:03] you get to heaven is your position
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:11] everybody okay everybody okay so the
[1:17:14] throne that was on the earth is picking
[1:17:17] you up until you matches the throne in
[1:17:20] heaven
[1:17:24] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[1:17:28] good so the first thing that you enter
[1:17:31] into heaven the first thing that John
[1:17:33] saw is the throne why the throne
[1:17:39] everybody good everybody good
[1:17:43] are we okay
[1:17:44] we found out last Sunday
[1:17:48] glory to God that God
[1:17:51] before he stopped creating anything
[1:17:55] God have to create or to birth himself
[1:18:01] you remember last Sunday anybody okay
[1:18:03] and the way God birth himself is God
[1:18:07] quickened himself
[1:18:10] everybody okay if you are a seed God
[1:18:13] also is a seed everybody okay so the
[1:18:16] first seed that was quick and was God
[1:18:18] himself
[1:18:20] everybody okay so when God quickened
[1:18:24] himself God came as a quick and seed and
[1:18:28] he he Murphy you understand this now God
[1:18:32] changed from from the invisible God into
[1:18:36] the seed that he just quick and which is
[1:18:38] the logos everybody okay then God took a
[1:18:42] light
[1:18:43] you remember that song A covering a
[1:18:46] theophany amen and Veil himself around
[1:18:50] and God was inside the light and from
[1:18:53] that light from that aspect everybody
[1:18:56] okay God begin to create everything
[1:19:00] everybody okay now the problem between
[1:19:03] me and you we didn't go on that line
[1:19:08] everybody okay we bypass
[1:19:12] that process instead of being taught
[1:19:15] quickened and going into our way to your
[1:19:19] funny amen we were never quickened by
[1:19:22] God
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:27] everybody okay everybody okay matter of
[1:19:31] fact what God did God created your human
[1:19:34] being and took your thought
[1:19:37] your seed your word and quickened
[1:19:43] dormant
[1:19:44] sleeping and took you and drop you into
[1:19:48] the flesh
[1:19:50] everybody okay that's why you don't know
[1:19:53] who you are
[1:19:56] Jesus knew who he was because Jesus was
[1:20:00] already quickened
[1:20:06] everybody okay and within that seed is
[1:20:10] the entire plan of your life
[1:20:19] he says you were on water
[1:20:23] by who God nothing happened by Waters

[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:15] come all I didn't have any other color
[1:21:18] to wear but purple
[1:21:21] because the prophet of God went back in
[1:21:26] the mind of God and so Kamala fell off
[1:21:29] and he prophesied that there will be a
[1:21:33] vice president a woman wearing which
[1:21:35] color did it happen he was assessed

[1:22:19] all right
[1:22:22] if God give you what you think is a
[1:22:25] troublemaker you need to go back
[1:22:27] together
[1:22:30] right that's right
[1:22:38] everybody okay
[1:22:40] everybody good
[1:22:42] everybody good so that seed was never
[1:22:47] quickened
[1:22:48] and you were placed into the body
[1:22:53] we design it like this

[1:23:18] three parts here your body your spirit
[1:23:21] and your soul this is the you that is
[1:23:25] temporal

[1:23:34] amen so because the seed was dropped
[1:23:37] into you dormant everybody okay this is
[1:23:41] why you didn't know who you were
[1:23:44] amen and this one was more active than
[1:23:48] this one and you begin to educate this
[1:23:51] one
[1:23:52] we begin to train this one and this one
[1:23:55] got more preeminence in your life than

[1:24:05] Amen
[1:24:07] this seed
[1:24:09] what they need is an Awakening we saw
[1:24:12] that last Sunday
[1:24:13] but it depends on which age it is
[1:24:21] everybody okay
[1:24:23] he must stumble you but I have to drop
[1:24:25] it everybody okay the Holy Ghost was
[1:24:29] given in the age of power
[1:24:34] everybody okay but the holy ghost that
[1:24:37] dropped there
[1:24:41] do you follow me was unable to take the
[1:24:46] people to this world
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:52] he was still the Holy Spirit but he was
[1:24:55] the holy spirit with limitation
[1:25:01] everybody okay
[1:25:03] you can choose this writers the Holy
[1:25:05] Ghost of Luther could only stop a
[1:25:09] justification
[1:25:10] but he was still the Holy Spirit
[1:25:13] everybody okay the Holy Ghost of Wesley
[1:25:17] could move from justification to
[1:25:20] sanctification and stop right there and
[1:25:23] you can go no higher than that one
[1:25:28] [Music]
[1:25:29] everybody okay that's why the Rapture
[1:25:32] never happened in those ages
[1:25:36] everybody okay
[1:25:38] the holy ghost in the Pentecostal could
[1:25:41] only go to the restoration of the gift
[1:25:43] and stop there amen we need the measure
[1:25:48] of the Holy Ghost That should be
[1:25:51] Unlimited
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:55] everybody okay we need the holy ghost
[1:25:58] that will restore God back on Earth
[1:26:09] Jesus Christ was the world made water so
[1:26:13] the end of the Gentile age must be the
[1:26:16] world made what we must move from the
[1:26:19] alpha and to the water and the Alpha and
[1:26:23] the Omega must be water
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:28] what made Jesus what he was because he
[1:26:32] had the fullness
[1:26:34] of the godhead how far in this end time
[1:26:38] we must also have water after God had
[1:26:42] how
[1:26:46] because we must be born of his
[1:26:49] the Flesh of his water we must be him
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:57] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[1:27:00] okay that's why the second oil could
[1:27:04] never be opened by the Virgin until the
[1:27:07] Midnight Cry
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:10] [Music]
[1:27:13] and brother Branham said he was the
[1:27:15] seventh to watch
[1:27:16] he was the seventh Church ages amen amen
[1:27:20] so to wake a seed of God today you need
[1:27:24] to know which message is Awakening
[1:27:26] that's it
[1:27:29] okay
[1:27:31] everybody okay brother Branham says this
[1:27:35] the bread has not had water
[1:27:39] there is no there has been water
[1:27:42] no we fight for there no water
[1:27:45] of God to stir the water but God was
[1:27:49] Healing The Sick
[1:27:51] God was raising the Dead
[1:27:54] God was removing cancer but brother
[1:27:57] Branham said the bride regardless of
[1:28:00] everything you see God doing under the

[1:28:25] back there to the water
[1:28:27] and he shall do it why because he did
[1:28:31] what promise
[1:28:32] so the only message that can wake the
[1:28:36] seed
[1:28:37] to the caliber that God wanted is a
[1:28:40] message of the seven pandas
[1:28:43] which are the Revelation
[1:28:45] contained under the seventh seal
[1:28:48] [Applause]
[1:28:50] because when the seal are broken this

[1:31:38] as he said who's passing there they're
[1:31:42] saying to Jesus he says son of David

[1:32:47] the Holy Spirit ever play around the sea
[1:32:51] he will never come out
[1:33:02] God one time instead of saying in heaven
[1:33:07] minding his business he saw Jacob in

[1:59:16] you are always a child of God you just
[1:59:20] didn't know who you are you thought you
[1:59:22] were the child of your father and your
[1:59:25] mother
[1:59:27] sometimes the one who give you birth
[1:59:30] will go in hell
[1:59:34] because truly your father is dead
[1:59:36] When you pray say our
[1:59:39] that's your true father
[1:59:43] we appreciate our father here but
[1:59:46] remember you got a bigger father than
[1:59:48] that
[1:59:50] when you are born it's not by the will
[1:59:53] of men not by the will of the flesh but
[1:59:56] but the will of who God everybody okay
[1:59:58] have I lost anyone
[2:00:01] glory to God the Bible brother Branham
[2:00:04] saying then you begin to do water
[2:00:07] to grow move and have water
[2:00:10] it's a big way
[2:00:11] see just as baby natural baby he has
[2:00:15] been in the water
[2:00:18] certain this voice I will preach with it
[2:00:21] glory to God
[2:00:27] listen to Brother Brad he said like a
[2:00:30] baby four minutes mother woman when the
[2:00:33] baby comes to the mother womb by the
[2:00:35] little water he does water into the
[2:00:39] water we already seen that
[2:00:41] it does not form oneself a human and the
[2:00:46] next water
[2:00:47] and the next water and the next what it
[2:00:51] will be all water
[2:00:53] because it's building off an original
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:01:02] in other words every cell that is
[2:01:06] building on top of this baby must be
[2:01:09] human cell
[2:01:13] everybody okay you don't put the captain
[2:01:15] no because it's not a cat birth
[2:01:19] everybody okay so if you on the
[2:01:23] spiritual you are born
[2:01:28] by the word of God
[2:01:31] so everything that will begin to be
[2:01:34] added won't be the material of the world
[2:01:39] it will be word on top of word on top of
[2:01:44] word on top of word on top of word
[2:01:47] that's why God taught brother Branham
[2:01:50] store up the word
[2:01:55] stir up the food
[2:01:57] because once an eagle is born he begin
[2:02:01] to read messages after messages ask the
[2:02:05] messages after messages after messages
[2:02:09] before you know it you are building
[2:02:12] another Giant
[2:02:15] that's why I'm telling you read your Cod
[2:02:18] read the church edges read the seal
[2:02:21] listen to the message because you cannot
[2:02:25] put something different than the world
[2:02:28] upon
[2:02:31] [Applause]
[2:02:37] land upon here
[2:02:41] before you know it you had a few gunman
[2:02:47] praise God
[2:02:54] Believe It or Not brother brother Robin
[2:02:56] I'm a five percent of the sermon
[2:03:03] I have 89 move
[2:03:05] we are five percent
[2:03:07] we won't get to that let's say this when
[2:03:10] a man has been born again by the water
[2:03:14] how
[2:03:16] to water eternal life call water
[2:03:21] of God on top of word on water not the
[2:03:26] denominational
[2:03:27] and then Earth and a Creed anyone
[2:03:32] you can't have that
[2:03:34] level in it only water why
[2:03:37] why who this
[2:03:41] eternal life and this eternal life are
[2:03:47] [Applause]
[2:03:48] that's why if a preacher
[2:03:54] if a preacher come in this public
[2:04:00] by invitation and begin to say something
[2:04:03] that is not like the word you hate that
[2:04:07] man
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:14] you will hear something in you
[2:04:16] questioning the preacher
[2:04:19] you don't know the court you never seen
[2:04:22] the court but something in you is
[2:04:25] telling you that doesn't sound good
[2:04:28] it is not you it is the eternity
[2:04:34] he only take the word
[2:04:37] and the world only
[2:04:39] [Applause]
[2:04:46] as soon as you leave the church brother
[2:04:49] Stephen
[2:04:50] text message
[2:04:52] tell me a little bit what was that
[2:04:54] preacher saying
[2:04:56] why
[2:04:58] because something in you didn't wing
[2:05:01] where did you know the word
[2:05:03] who taught you the message that you
[2:05:05] begin to tell where what is right and
[2:05:07] what is wrong how do you know what is
[2:05:09] right and what is wrong did you read the
[2:05:11] entire message so how can you tell
[2:05:16] how can you tell it wrong because this
[2:05:19] guy he knows everything
[2:05:23] even if you don't know the scripture he
[2:05:26] knows everything and the day you will
[2:05:29] see the court you will find yourself
[2:05:31] just because the Lord that's why that's
[2:05:34] why that's why that's why

[2:06:12] never never the person
[2:06:18] even if you sugarcoat the world anyway
[2:06:21] that person won't work with you
[2:06:25] amen that's why many said in this
[2:06:27] message have been laying dormant in
[2:06:30] message churches
[2:06:31] because they were not preaching the true
[2:06:33] message
[2:06:34] or the preacher was deluding the message
[2:06:37] and the young people are unable to grow
[2:06:45] but let them come to a real message of
[2:06:48] church where the message is laid down
[2:06:55] you don't teach them to be on church on
[2:06:57] time
[2:06:58] you don't wake them on Sunday
[2:07:01] they can't wait to be Sunday what is
[2:07:03] pressing the young people
[2:07:05] what is giving them the hunger what are
[2:07:08] they looking for

[2:07:46] I hope I can find there because I have
[2:07:49] to deal with your condemnation
[2:07:53] okay okay but I can't get there let me
[2:07:56] try to close quickly glory to God Amen

[2:24:06] we need is water sons and daughter needs
[2:24:10] water how can the church depend a
[2:24:13] coastal church and the Methodist and the
[2:24:16] Baptist Church be adopted until they
[2:24:18] come to water discipline
[2:24:27] why discipline
[2:24:30] we got to be water disciplined first
[2:24:34] God
[2:24:35] could not trust this power with the
[2:24:39] church it is hard to tell what you would
[2:24:42] do
[2:24:44] [Music]
[2:24:47] in other words you are wired
[2:24:50] born
[2:24:52] fashion design built a god
[2:24:58] that's no moral problem we already
[2:25:01] solved that when the Holy Ghost come
[2:25:03] he's coming to wake the god up and the
[2:25:06] God is awakened and the god need to go
[2:25:08] and become a big big big God the problem
[2:25:12] is God doesn't have a problem with power
[2:25:16] he doesn't have a problem with what he
[2:25:19] built the engine you are God has a
[2:25:22] problem with your discipline before he
[2:25:25] release everything
[2:25:28] the man is in the back
[2:25:33] [Music]
[2:25:36] everything you desire there is money to
[2:25:39] cover it the problem is that you
[2:25:43] trustworthy to be given their bank
[2:25:45] account

[2:25:49] because if they are listed wrong you
[2:25:52] make people disappear on the highway
[2:25:57] [Music]
[2:26:00] if somebody crosses you wrong you
[2:26:03] disappear
[2:26:09] come on
[2:26:12] and power with that character is water
[2:26:18] so what will determine the discipline
[2:26:26] now placing the water
[2:26:29] first thing after the sun was he became
[2:26:32] a water
[2:26:33] but then we found out his water is what
[2:26:37] set him where
[2:26:39] did he behave right oh
[2:26:42] [Music]
[2:26:44] amen
[2:26:46] if you don't know how to discipline
[2:26:49] yourself to the things of God God will
[2:26:52] lock the power
[2:26:55] the engine is there the power is there
[2:26:58] but the character is needed in order to
[2:27:02] handle the power
[2:27:06] everybody okay everybody okay if you

[2:47:59] you pray on your own
[2:48:01] let me give you a few minutes
[2:48:04] as you play something soft
[2:48:08] because in our life there are things
[2:48:10] that need to die
[2:48:13] there's the area we don't have
[2:48:15] discipline
[2:48:20] and God is not here to put you down
[2:48:23] God is here to Build You Up
[2:48:27] so that you can realize who you are
[2:48:31] and you can do the work of God
[2:48:35] and be about the father's business
[2:48:40] and at that point
[2:48:42] you will be successful 100 percent
[2:48:45] because you're not following yourself
[2:48:47] anymore
[2:48:49] you begin to follow the guidance of God
[2:48:52] what he has planned for you
[2:48:55] what he's kept for you
[2:48:59] go ahead on your own way
[2:49:01] and begin to pray and then we will close
[2:49:03] it
[2:49:05] yes sir
[2:49:08] thank you Jesus
[2:49:20] Hallelujah Lord
[2:49:27] come Lord and help us
[2:49:31] Hallelujah
[2:49:53] don't worry about who's beside you
[2:49:54] you're talking to your own father
[2:50:02] the Bible says the house will be called
[2:50:04] The House of Prayer
[2:50:27] Hallelujah
[2:50:46] Heavenly Father
[2:50:48] Lord once again we are approaching you
[2:50:51] humbly
[2:50:54] father thanking you for the word
[2:50:57] that you have brought to us this morning
[2:51:02] I'm failing your Plan of Redemption
[2:51:06] Opening Our Eyes
[2:51:09] our spiritualizers
[2:51:11] so that we can see
[2:51:13] really Who We Are
[2:51:16] and we can be moved from the Realms of
[2:51:20] confusion
[2:51:21] into the reality
[2:51:23] of what Sons and Daughters of God should
[2:51:26] be
[2:51:30] father you spoke to us
[2:51:32] that our greatest enemy
[2:51:35] the one that need to be disciplined
[2:51:38] the one that would need to be moved the
[2:51:40] other way
[2:51:41] the one that we need to master
[2:51:44] is our own Lord
[2:51:47] because if we can defeat our own
[2:51:50] then there is no enemy that can stand in
[2:51:53] front of us
[2:51:55] father
[2:51:57] may you help each person in here this
[2:51:59] building
[2:52:00] and those that are streaming online
[2:52:03] that you give to them a special Grace
[2:52:07] and give to us also a special Grace
[2:52:10] that father
[2:52:12] we can bring this body
[2:52:15] into subjection
[2:52:17] to the word of God
[2:52:19] bring him into subjection to the things
[2:52:22] that belong to the kingdom
[2:52:25] father you know how weak we are
[2:52:28] you know Lord where I struggle are
[2:52:32] you know Lord father where we have fed
[2:52:35] you so many times
[2:52:37] and Lord without you there is nothing
[2:52:40] that we can do
[2:52:41] yes that's why we are calling upon you
[2:52:43] father so that your mercy can be poor
[2:52:46] this morning
[2:52:47] that you can give us a special Grace
[2:52:51] a special anointing
[2:52:53] that will Quicken our being
[2:52:57] so that father
[2:52:59] you can gain pre-eminence
[2:53:01] into each person and each life Lord
[2:53:05] you did it in Jesus Christ and you say
[2:53:08] Lord father that you wanted to have that
[2:53:10] preeminence in the blood
[2:53:12] and father your word even told us that
[2:53:16] you the one that brought brother Branham
[2:53:18] to be surrendered unto you
[2:53:19] may you bring each family
[2:53:22] each person
[2:53:24] each individual in this building
[2:53:27] to submit themselves to the will of God
[2:53:30] to realize how powerless we are
[2:53:33] how dependent we are built
[2:53:38] to be looking unto thee
[2:53:40] who is the author and the finisher of
[2:53:43] our faith
[2:53:44] so that Lord fathered these promises
[2:53:47] that you have promised to us
[2:53:50] what you have built us Lord father the
[2:53:52] very hour that we are
[2:53:54] so we can manifest the nature of God in
[2:53:58] our lives Lord
[2:54:00] because Lord we have used our brain we
[2:54:03] have used our intelligence we have used
[2:54:06] our human ability and we have failed so
[2:54:09] many times we found ourselves pushed to
[2:54:11] the corner we found ourselves where
[2:54:13] things are not working the way we plan
[2:54:15] but father there is a bigger plan than
[2:54:18] what we thought and that is a divine
[2:54:21] plan that you have for us in our life
[2:54:23] and father we pray
[2:54:25] that you come and help us Lord
[2:54:28] so that from this day forward
[2:54:31] we can give way to the inner men
[2:54:35] so that Lord father we can move from
[2:54:38] Victory to Victory from glory to glory
[2:54:46] until we can enjoy the very rest of God
[2:54:50] where our soul are resting
[2:54:54] is the one working because that is what
[2:54:57] he was built for
[2:54:59] father bless your children
[2:55:01] touch those that are sick in the body
[2:55:03] and afflicted
[2:55:04] father may you strengthen and heal them
[2:55:07] Lord may you protect us as we go into
[2:55:09] our respective Place may you continue to
[2:55:12] unfold your word and to Quicken this
[2:55:15] Revelation so that they can become more
[2:55:17] real unto us until we can see you face
[2:55:22] to face and not again Lord father
[2:55:24] through a cloudy Shadow Lord we asked in
[2:55:29] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:55:31] Hallelujah
