[0:00] Now you believe that
[0:02] we have to be in Christ in Christ. We
[0:06] have to be of Christ. In Christ, part of
[0:08] Christ. What is a woman when she takes a
[0:10] man or a man takes a woman? That woman
[0:13] has to be part of him. They're no longer
[0:16] two. They're one.

[10:50] you. Oh Lord
[10:52] God, Lord, the yearning, Lord, and the
[10:56] the groaning, Lord, as the Bible puts
[10:58] it, Lord, grows every day, Lord God,
[11:01] just to be there with you, Lord God. We
[11:04] know that you're here with us, Lord, but
[11:07] that's the marriage land, Lord God. And
[11:10] this is just a desire, Lord, that just
[11:12] grows stronger every day in our hearts,
[11:14] Lord, and in our soul, Lord, just to get
[11:17] out of this world, Lord, and to be with
[11:19] you eternally, Lord God. We know that
[11:21] you're preparing our homes, Lord. And we
[11:24] thank you, Father. We thank you for
[11:27] everything, every bit of everything that
[11:30] you do for us every day, Lord.
[11:33] And we're grateful, Lord, this morning
[11:35] that we can gather together once again
[11:37] and worship you, Lord. We've come, Lord,
[11:40] and we're asking that you give us today,
[11:42] Lord, this day our daily bread, Lord
[11:44] God. Bless our pastor, Lord, as he's
[11:48] preparing that bread to bring us, Lord
[11:50] God. That you and he probably stayed up
[11:52] to the wee hours of the morning
[11:53] together, Lord, putting it together and
[11:56] baking it and just making it just right
[11:58] for us, Lord God. And we thank you,
[12:00] Father.
[12:01] Bless our precious musicians, Lord, and
[12:04] our singers, Lord, and our technicians,
[12:07] Lord, that just want to make everything
[12:08] just perfect, Lord. We want this to be a
[12:10] perfect service for you, Lord God.
[12:14] Everything that is sung, everything that
[12:15] is spoken, every key that's touched on
[12:18] the instruments, Lord, it's for your
[12:20] glory, Lord God. And we just want to
[12:22] give it all to you, Lord. And then we
[12:24] have our precious congregation. Lord,
[12:27] that the which is the purchase of the
[12:29] blood that was shed at Calvary,
[12:32] Lord, before many of us were even aware
[12:35] of it, Lord, while we were yet doing our
[12:38] foolish things, Lord, you died for us,
[12:40] Lord, on that cross. And you rose again,
[12:44] Lord, to show us, Lord, that there's a
[12:46] resurrection coming. You were the first
[12:49] of that, Lord. We thank you, Father. We
[12:52] thank you, Lord. Bless this entire
[12:54] service, Lord, from start to finish.
[12:57] Bless every heart and soul that's
[12:59] present here today. Lord, and also this
[13:01] streaming, Lord. Bless those that are on
[13:04] their way, Lord. Give them safe travel,
[13:07] Lord. We know that it's not any fun
[13:09] driving these highways anymore, Lord
[13:11] God. So, bless them and be with them,
[13:14] Lord. We give every portion of this
[13:16] service to you in the precious name of
[13:18] Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen.

[1:02:30] right now but I will see how you would
[1:02:32] do because something else open up and I
[1:02:35] have to squeeze Esther somewhere there.
[1:02:38] So bear with me how if we jump Esther
[1:02:40] quickly then you do good. Amen. So I
[1:02:43] will get to that my brother. But
[1:02:44] congratulation. I'm proud of you. Keep
[1:02:47] on moving.
[1:02:54] Yes. I believe brother John already
[1:02:56] covered this. Brother Tony called me
[1:02:57] this morning. So you pray for sister
[1:02:59] laa. But I know she's going to be well.
[1:03:01] She was she had to be taken to the
[1:03:03] emergency to check her eye. But we pray
[1:03:05] and sent pray here and we know that God
[1:03:09] answers prayer. That one we are already
[1:03:12] clear with it. Amen. Brother Matamba
[1:03:15] sent me a flyer of the meeting. He has
[1:03:18] meeting that will be starting this
[1:03:20] Friday, this coming Friday and then uh
[1:03:23] throughout the weekend. And then on
[1:03:25] Sunday, on Saturday morning, they will
[1:03:28] have a minister meeting. It's an elder
[1:03:30] that came from overseas. I know him very
[1:03:32] well. And brother Matamba prepared the
[1:03:35] meeting. He sent me the flyer. I print
[1:03:37] out the flyer. I give it to the head
[1:03:38] deacon. And we stick the flyer on the
[1:03:41] board there. So, anyone who can help
[1:03:43] support the meeting, be there. But if
[1:03:46] you cannot make it, just make sure you
[1:03:48] pray for the meeting so everything go
[1:03:50] successfully. So, if you need the
[1:03:52] information, it's right there. I print
[1:03:54] out the flyer. I put it back there and
[1:03:56] then we move on. Amen. I believe I got
[1:03:59] everything clear. Brother Kelly, brother
[1:04:03] uh Tony, brother Robert, if I forgot
[1:04:06] something, you let me know. So, let's
[1:04:07] see how far we can go today. and we pick
[1:04:10] up Mama Zebedee and begin
[1:04:13] to to fly. Amen. So, let's stand for the
[1:04:17] reading of the Bible. My subject this
[1:04:20] morning,
[1:04:23] uh, flight attendant, prepare for
[1:04:26] takeoff. Amen. My subject this morning,
[1:04:29] Brother John told me tomorrow it's
[1:04:31] Memorial Day.
[1:04:35] Take your time. Take your time now,
[1:04:37] brother.
[1:04:38] So,
[1:04:41] so many of you are now working,
[1:04:45] children are out of school. So, please,
[1:04:48] you have your time to enjoy the sermon.
[1:04:51] I mean the song. So, give me my time.
[1:04:55] Tomorrow you don't have school. Tomorrow
[1:04:58] you don't have work.
[1:05:00] It is Memorial Day.
[1:05:05] [Laughter]
[1:05:07] My subject this morning is our life
[1:05:10] journey
[1:05:11] through Joseph's five garment part 62.
[1:05:17] We have a traffic. So you do good, we
[1:05:20] start moving the traffic around. If not,
[1:05:22] it keep getting backed up until we'll be
[1:05:25] backed up all the way. Amen.
[1:05:27] So I changed the the subject the the
[1:05:31] team with sister Adasa last Sunday
[1:05:33] because of the direction things went so
[1:05:36] we could not get it. So our team this
[1:05:38] morning is divine purpose sister
[1:05:45] divine divine purpose versus humanity.
[1:05:52] And you know that you can live in three
[1:05:54] realms. Brother saying either you are in
[1:05:57] the human realm or in the faith which is
[1:06:00] the revelation or you get to the vision
[1:06:03] which is that save the lord. So stay
[1:06:05] really tuned and let this material soak
[1:06:08] in. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly father
[1:06:12] Lord we approaching you humbly this
[1:06:14] morning. Father we thank you once again
[1:06:17] for your grace, your love, your mercy,
[1:06:19] for everything that you have been doing
[1:06:21] for us for coming into the house of God.
[1:06:24] with wonderful scent of like precious
[1:06:27] faith, filling the presence of the Lord,
[1:06:29] worshiping you together, and even Sister
[1:06:32] Pam being able to make it to the service
[1:06:34] this morning. Father, we thank you for
[1:06:37] everything, all that are here, visible
[1:06:39] and invisible. Lord, may you receive all
[1:06:42] the glory. Father, this is as far as I
[1:06:44] can go with the ability that you have
[1:06:46] given me. But when it comes Lord Father
[1:06:49] to speaking, interpreting, hearing Lord
[1:06:52] Father, your word because the the the
[1:06:55] the scripture stated Lord Father that
[1:06:58] the hearing of the word give the Holy
[1:07:00] Spirit Lord. Father may you come and
[1:07:02] move humanity completely away. May you
[1:07:04] come and be the one speaking and the one
[1:07:07] hearing, interpreting, filling,
[1:07:09] blessing, delivering. May you do
[1:07:11] everything for your children because you
[1:07:13] are all for us Lord. We commit it all
[1:07:15] unto the hand Lord. May you bless us
[1:07:18] this morning in the name of Jesus
[1:07:20] Christ. Amen. Let's go to Jeremiah 29
[1:07:25] again. Jeremiah
[1:07:27] 29
[1:07:30] 11. You need your Bible.
[1:07:34] So make sure you got your Bible because
[1:07:37] these things need to be
[1:07:39] really established well. Amen. By the
[1:07:42] grace of God.
[1:07:44] Amen. Amen. Amen. We need the miracle.
[1:07:50] Amen. You are the miracle.
[1:07:54] I wish I had a wonderful voice like
[1:07:56] that. Amen. And we going to get the
[1:08:00] glory. Oh
[1:08:02] my. The whole message was already been
[1:08:04] preached. Verse 11, the Bible say, "For
[1:08:07] I know."
[1:08:09] You know who knows. Amen. I
[1:08:12] know the thoughts plural. These are
[1:08:16] wonderful thought that I think toward
[1:08:18] you says the Lord. Thoughts of peace.
[1:08:23] Why do we get trouble?
[1:08:26] You understand these things now?
[1:08:28] Thoughts of peace and not of evil. But
[1:08:31] why does evil come?
[1:08:35] The attribute of God call for it. Amen.
[1:08:38] Thought of peace and not of evil to give
[1:08:41] you an expected end. So the beginning is
[1:08:46] good. Amen.
[1:08:49] Thoughts of peace and the ending is
[1:08:52] good. Amen. So no matter what happen in
[1:08:54] the middle, you start good, you will end
[1:08:57] up good. You might be seated. Let's go
[1:09:00] to 1 Corinthian chapter
[1:09:03] 2. The beginning of your life
[1:09:07] good. The ending of your life
[1:09:10] good. 100% guarantee.
[1:09:16] Second uh 1 Corinthian chapter
[1:09:20] 2. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:09:24] Same scripture we read the last
[1:09:26] time. Verse 7. If you are there, you can
[1:09:30] say amen. Amen.
[1:09:33] Glory to
[1:09:35] God. The Bible says verse seven, Paul,
[1:09:39] but we
[1:09:40] speak the wisdom of God. You know who
[1:09:43] the wisdom of God is? Can somebody
[1:09:46] remind me? Christ. Praise God. We speak
[1:09:50] Christ, the wisdom of God in a mystery.
[1:09:54] Yes. So he's preaching Christ in a
[1:09:58] mystery.
[1:10:00] That's why brother Brandham say I preach
[1:10:02] like Paul.
[1:10:04] [Laughter]
[1:10:06] Paul was preaching Jesus Christ in a
[1:10:08] mystery. This message is the revelation
[1:10:11] of the mystery. He say, "But we speak
[1:10:14] the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
[1:10:18] hidden wisdom which God
[1:10:23] ordained before the world to our glory."
[1:10:28] So there is a mystery that was hidden
[1:10:30] here. Yes. And that mystery was in the
[1:10:33] mind of God. Yes. And God purpose,
[1:10:36] right? Ordain that mystery for our
[1:10:40] glory. So we have a package of mystery.
[1:10:44] And if you open that gift, that package
[1:10:46] of mystery, it's going to be for your
[1:10:48] glory. Amen. We clear. Amen. So we got a
[1:10:52] wisdom, a mystery. This
[1:10:55] mystery Paul is saying that it is for
[1:10:58] our glory.
[1:11:00] Amen. If it belongs to me and it's from
[1:11:02] my glory, I need to have it. That's
[1:11:05] right. That's right. Because God already
[1:11:08] or it for me. Amen. So it doesn't belong
[1:11:12] to God anymore. That's right. There is
[1:11:14] brother. Amen.
[1:11:16] Brother Brandham say God is not an
[1:11:18] Indian giver. No sir. Who give you
[1:11:20] something and pick it up. No sir. Once
[1:11:22] God give, it's gone. Amen. Are we clear?
[1:11:27] Put your seat belt my friend. Verse
[1:11:29] eight. which none of the princes of this
[1:11:33] world knew, they cannot get it. Amen.
[1:11:38] For have had they know it,
[1:11:41] they would not have crucified the water,
[1:11:45] the Lord of glory, if they would have
[1:11:47] tested of this mystery, no Calvary,
[1:11:52] if they knew.
[1:11:54] But God blinded them. So that Calvary
[1:11:58] can happen. Amen. In other words, there
[1:12:00] is a connection between the mystery of
[1:12:03] your glory and Calvary. Amen. Without
[1:12:07] Calvary, no delivery. Amen. Of your
[1:12:10] mystery of glory. Amen. Are we together?
[1:12:13] Amen. So, there is a
[1:12:15] connection between this mystery and
[1:12:18] Calvary. When I say Calvary, you don't
[1:12:21] get it. With crucifixion,
[1:12:25] there is putting somebody naked on the
[1:12:28] cross.
[1:12:30] And not just somebody, God himself.
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:34] Amen.
[1:12:36] What a curse.
[1:12:40] Amen. Hang him on a tree as a criminal.
[1:12:45] When he didn't do anything, but that was
[1:12:48] needed. Yes, sir. To deliver your
[1:12:50] package. What type of package is this
[1:12:54] that required the death of the creator?
[1:12:58] What is in that package?
[1:13:02] Come on, Lord.
[1:13:05] Do you understand what I'm saying? You
[1:13:07] have a package that they have to deliver
[1:13:09] from Amazon, but they have to kill
[1:13:11] somebody for it. So, what is in that
[1:13:13] package? What is the price of that
[1:13:16] package?
[1:13:17] What is the treasure that is hidden in
[1:13:19] that package that require God to die?
[1:13:22] Jesus.
[1:13:24] He required the life of God in order to
[1:13:27] bring in order to bring that package to
[1:13:29] you.
[1:13:32] Amen.
[1:13:33] Are we together? Are we together? God
[1:13:37] blinded somebody.
[1:13:40] So that crucifixion can happen. Without
[1:13:43] crucifixion, no delivery. Amen. Are we
[1:13:46] clear so far? Amen. We clear so far?
[1:13:48] Amen. Now remember, we are dealing with
[1:13:51] prayers. Yes. And the prayer we are
[1:13:54] dealing with is not the prayer of
[1:13:56] sinners. No sir. Because God doesn't
[1:14:00] hear sinners. No sir. We clear. Amen.
[1:14:03] God only hear sinner when they want to
[1:14:05] repent. That's right.
[1:14:08] That's correct. Are we together? Amen.
[1:14:10] But what we have been dealing with is a
[1:14:12] Christian's prayer. Uh-huh. Are we
[1:14:15] together? Amen. And we found out that
[1:14:17] God always answer Christian prayer.
[1:14:20] Amen. That one we clear now. We have
[1:14:23] already built a confidence. And the way
[1:14:26] God answer, God answer either by a yes.
[1:14:30] Whicheverbody like or God says no. But
[1:14:35] at least God have answered you.
[1:14:39] And brother Brandham say when God answer
[1:14:42] you by a no, this no is better than the
[1:14:46] yes. We will get to it, my friend. Amen.
[1:14:49] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:14:52] Glory to God. And the way we were wired
[1:14:56] like I say last Sunday.
[1:14:58] When you ask somebody when you pray and
[1:15:01] you come back you say God have answered
[1:15:04] me. What you are saying is God have say
[1:15:08] yes. Right. That's right brother. Amen.
[1:15:11] You got what you were asking for. Amen.
[1:15:13] That's why you you you you are you are
[1:15:16] testifying
[1:15:18] all our testimonies here.
[1:15:22] Ah come on. Come on. Let's preach
[1:15:24] together. All our testimonies that stand
[1:15:27] here. It is because God have said yes.
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:36] You heard brother Enoch today saying
[1:15:38] preach. So today is a different day my
[1:15:40] friend.
[1:15:42] Are we together? Nobody comes here and
[1:15:44] say I want to praise the Lord. I ask the
[1:15:47] Lord to give me something and God say
[1:15:50] no. Thank you Jesus. God bless you.
[1:15:53] Everybody will be looking at you like
[1:15:57] come on
[1:15:59] Lord. My my my are we together? Amen.
[1:16:03] Are we together? Amen. So we need to
[1:16:05] change now the way we are perceiving.
[1:16:08] Amen. God answer prayer. Uh-huh. Whether
[1:16:12] God say yes or no, it's always good.
[1:16:15] Amen.
[1:16:17] Amen.
[1:16:18] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:16:21] Amen. But brother Brandham make a
[1:16:23] statement like this.
[1:16:25] William Marion Brham. Brother Brham says
[1:16:27] in the message the way I think Pentecost
[1:16:31] fell.
[1:16:34] Brother Brandham say you can never
[1:16:39] exhaust God's love and mercy to you.
[1:16:49] I hope I'm talking to redeemer.
[1:16:52] If you are a Judah, you will.
[1:16:56] But I'm not a Judah.
[1:17:00] There is a difference between Judah and
[1:17:01] Peter.
[1:17:03] No matter how far Peter goes, Peter can
[1:17:06] never exhaust God mercy and love for
[1:17:10] him. Judah will not Peter.
[1:17:15] Esau will not Jacob. Because before the
[1:17:18] foundation of the world, I love Jacob.
[1:17:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:24] Yes, sir. Amen, Lord. Are we together?
[1:17:26] Amen. Brother Brandham say you say well
[1:17:31] I hate to bother you so much father.
[1:17:36] He wants to be bothered that way. Amen.
[1:17:40] Amen.
[1:17:42] God answer your prayer. Right. God want
[1:17:45] to be bothered that way. He does. Don't
[1:17:48] never think that you could ever ask too
[1:17:52] much.
[1:17:54] That's it. Of God. Hallelujah. I believe
[1:17:58] the scripture say you have not because
[1:18:02] because what you ask not and you ask not
[1:18:05] because you believe not. He want us to
[1:18:09] ask and believe that our joy will be how
[1:18:11] full. He want you to ask how?
[1:18:14] Abundantly.
[1:18:19] I'm getting somewhere. Are we together?
[1:18:22] Amen. Ask for big things. Amen.
[1:18:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:31] Our humanity have caused us many
[1:18:33] trouble.
[1:18:36] Amen. Are we together? Are we together?
[1:18:40] This is my clicker right here.
[1:18:43] If I tell you come and pick up the
[1:18:45] clicker. Uhhuh. Everybody here will be
[1:18:48] moving here quickly.
[1:18:50] And some will even come and and go this
[1:18:53] way.
[1:18:55] And the reason why you do it because of
[1:18:58] the size
[1:19:00] of the click.
[1:19:02] Follow me my friend.
[1:19:05] Because of the size of the clicker. You
[1:19:08] already calibrated your strength.
[1:19:14] Brother
[1:19:17] to the size of the clicker and you have
[1:19:20] seen that and some of you won't even
[1:19:22] move. You will tell liver. You say liver
[1:19:25] go pick it up because according to you
[1:19:27] this is so small
[1:19:31] even a child can do it. But if I tell
[1:19:34] you come and pick up this pulpit
[1:19:38] not many people will come here. We will
[1:19:41] begin to look for the big guys with
[1:19:44] muscles.
[1:19:47] Are you following me? Amen. Are you
[1:19:49] following me? Amen. Because we think
[1:19:51] that we need more strength here to move
[1:19:54] this thing. And we took that concept
[1:19:57] into the
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:00] [Applause]
[1:20:02] spiritual. That's it. Do you follow what
[1:20:05] I'm saying? Amen. If you tell somebody,
[1:20:08] hey, you can pray God to give you a
[1:20:11] hamburger, everybody will believe it.
[1:20:15] Because we know hamburger is nothing.
[1:20:18] So the faith goes quickly.
[1:20:20] If you tell somebody just as the same
[1:20:23] way you believe for a hamburger, God can
[1:20:26] give you a free house.
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:40] Are we
[1:20:41] together? When we get to the free house,
[1:20:46] our faith begin to change. You begin to
[1:20:49] think that you need a bigger faith.
[1:20:57] Are we together? Amen. We need to
[1:20:59] change. The message came to change our
[1:21:02] concept. Amen. The message came to
[1:21:05] change our thinking. Amen. That's why
[1:21:07] brother Brandham say ask big thing.
[1:21:10] Amen.
[1:21:15] Amen.
[1:21:19] My friend, I'm tired about the hypocrisy
[1:21:23] I have seen in this message.
[1:21:25] And we hide under
[1:21:27] humility on me. I'm good. I don't like
[1:21:30] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:21:32] no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's push to
[1:21:35] the deep.
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:44] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:47] Do you know how much faith you have in
[1:21:48] your medication?
[1:21:51] Come on now.
[1:21:53] Once you take a Tylenol, you have faith.
[1:21:59] Once you put Tylenol on it, you have
[1:22:01] faith. You can go even to sleep knowing
[1:22:04] that after few hours Tylenol will kick
[1:22:07] in.
[1:22:08] But if they tell you remove Tylenol,
[1:22:16] every time I get Tylenol in help,
[1:22:19] brother Steven, you know God healed by
[1:22:21] medicine and you begin to pull the coat
[1:22:24] to support your weak faith.
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:22:34] Are we together? Are we together now?
[1:22:37] Brother Brandham me say ask abundantly.
[1:22:43] Lord Jesus.
[1:22:45] And what do you ask? Big things. Big
[1:22:48] things.
[1:22:49] Amen.
[1:22:51] Can I continue with William? Amen.
[1:22:53] Brother Brandham say ask for what? Big
[1:22:56] things. Don't limit your faith to some
[1:22:59] water. Little mustard seed.
[1:23:05] When I'm praying for the salvation of my
[1:23:08] son, I don't say salvation. I say
[1:23:12] salvation filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:15] Baptize, redeem, and put everything.
[1:23:21] [Applause]
[1:23:28] Oh my god. He says ask for what? Big
[1:23:31] things. Don't limit your faith to some
[1:23:33] water, good old mustard seed. Get on out
[1:23:36] here to some kind the kind of water
[1:23:39] faith and move out into water. Big
[1:23:42] things, big things is just as easy.
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:53] Can you preach with me, my friend? Big
[1:23:56] things is just as easy to receive as
[1:23:58] what? Little things. So today you need
[1:24:01] to change your concept
[1:24:04] in the kingdom of God. Picking up this
[1:24:07] and picking up the pulpit is the same
[1:24:09] thing.
[1:24:13] Are we together? Are we together? That's
[1:24:16] why when the disciples say increase our
[1:24:18] faith, Jesus said no. If you have a
[1:24:22] faith like a mustard seed, you will
[1:24:25] speak to this mountain. Look at the
[1:24:27] seed. Look at the mountain. The seed
[1:24:30] will move the mountain.
[1:24:34] It is not the size, but it's the
[1:24:36] substance.
[1:24:38] [Applause]
[1:24:42] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:24:46] together? The same faith you using for a
[1:24:48] hamburger, that same faith will even buy
[1:24:51] a car.
[1:24:54] But when we say buy a car, you backed
[1:24:56] up. Right. You say, "No, no, no. I need
[1:24:59] to fast three days." No, sir. No, sir.
[1:25:03] Why didn't you fast for the hamburger?
[1:25:06] Amen. Because in your mind, ah, this is
[1:25:10] big. He required this. He required this.
[1:25:13] He required. So, I need more faith. I
[1:25:16] need more anointing. That's right. Amen.
[1:25:20] I need to pray all night.
[1:25:23] Brother Brandham say big things are just
[1:25:25] as easy to receive as water. Little
[1:25:27] things. You just have to do what?
[1:25:30] Believe and water. That's all. And you
[1:25:32] gotaith faith. Just know exactly how to
[1:25:36] use it. It will be water. All right. You
[1:25:39] can put it right to work and it shall be
[1:25:41] how? Just fine. Amen. Thank you. So
[1:25:44] today you understand Lord that asking
[1:25:48] for a house
[1:25:50] is the same a paid full house is the
[1:25:54] same as asking for a
[1:25:57] pencil sir
[1:26:01] before God.
[1:26:03] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:26:06] We clear right? Amen. But brother
[1:26:09] Steven, if big things are so easy,
[1:26:13] what I have noticed in my life is when I
[1:26:17] ask little things, it happen.
[1:26:22] But when I begin to ask big things, it
[1:26:25] seems like God doesn't hear my prayer.
[1:26:30] Amen. The problem is your faith
[1:26:34] number one, which we are changing. And
[1:26:36] the second thing is the principle of
[1:26:39] Ecclesiastes.
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:26:45] It is not the matter of the request you
[1:26:48] are bringing. The request or the size of
[1:26:52] the request is not a problem. It's a
[1:26:54] matter of time.
[1:26:58] Season and purpose. Amen. When those
[1:27:02] elements are met, no matter how big the
[1:27:06] mountain is, that mountain will be
[1:27:09] moved.
[1:27:14] Amen. Are we together? Amen. It's a
[1:27:18] matter of three element.
[1:27:20] It is
[1:27:21] time, it is season, and it is purpose.
[1:27:26] You understand times very well now. You
[1:27:29] understand season very well. We are
[1:27:31] still dealing with purpose. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:35] Now when we dealt uh last week about
[1:27:38] this, I want to reread this because I
[1:27:40] took a different angle. I want to
[1:27:42] correct it. Brother Brandham said to
[1:27:44] show you how slow it come. I waited
[1:27:47] myself for an answer from God for a
[1:27:51] what? A vision. Brother Brandham was
[1:27:53] waiting for a vision.
[1:27:55] But it took how many years? 15 years.
[1:27:58] Yes.
[1:28:03] Are we together? Then another come and I
[1:28:06] won't have to wait. But how? Three
[1:28:09] minutes. God answer how? In his own
[1:28:12] time. We don't control it. He control
[1:28:15] us. That's right.
[1:28:20] The one who receive in three minute will
[1:28:23] glorify God and intimidate the other
[1:28:26] one.
[1:28:29] like your prayer God don't heal you need
[1:28:33] to come to my church in our church we
[1:28:36] get miracle sir
[1:28:40] it is not a matter of that it's a matter
[1:28:43] of God's
[1:28:45] purpose even if you are home God will
[1:28:48] heal you
[1:28:52] are we together are we together so
[1:28:55] according to purpose Ephesians 1 says
[1:28:58] that in whom also we have obtained what
[1:29:01] an inheritance being predestinated
[1:29:03] according to the water the purpose of
[1:29:05] him who workketh who workketh what all
[1:29:08] things how after the counsel of his own
[1:29:11] how many things does he work for all
[1:29:13] things
[1:29:15] how many things all things so everything
[1:29:18] that is going on in your life God is
[1:29:21] maneuvering them
[1:29:25] to fit his purpose Amen.
[1:29:28] Amen. Are we together? Amen. And the
[1:29:31] purpose of God is his will. Amen.
[1:29:36] Or his desire. Amen. And God will work
[1:29:41] everything
[1:29:44] to make sure what he purpose. Yes sir.
[1:29:47] For your life is fulfilled. Amen. Are we
[1:29:49] clear? Amen. Are we clear? Amen. Glory
[1:29:52] to God. Then brother Brandham says this.
[1:29:54] Glory. We there. I ask him for something
[1:29:57] how sometime he check his head he says
[1:30:00] what no so there are time god say yes
[1:30:03] that's right yes sir brother Brandham
[1:30:06] didn't say all the time that's right
[1:30:08] sometime he says what no and then
[1:30:11] brother Brandham say I just rejoice
[1:30:14] as much about that you get an answer no
[1:30:19] and you coming glory to God what
[1:30:22] happened brother God says no to my
[1:30:24] prayer
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:28] It takes some kind of maturity.
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:34] Do you know what we do? Do you know what
[1:30:36] we do?
[1:30:41] I thought this is the husband.
[1:30:44] I have been waiting to get married. This
[1:30:46] relationship didn't work.
[1:30:50] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:55] You don't see the future. There is a yes
[1:30:58] in the future. But this one is no
[1:31:01] because it's not yours.
[1:31:03] [Applause]
[1:31:06] It is full of trouble.
[1:31:09] It doesn't match your purpose.
[1:31:12] [Applause]
[1:31:13] It doesn't match your caliber. Amen.
[1:31:16] Brother Brandham say God send Elijah to
[1:31:20] the widow woman because the widow woman
[1:31:23] was in the same caliber as Elijah.
[1:31:27] [Applause]
[1:31:28] Your caliber is like brother.
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:34] That's why God sent you Elijah the
[1:31:37] prophet. God knew who you are.
[1:31:41] Hallelujah.
[1:31:43] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's why they
[1:31:46] cannot take you away from the message.
[1:31:49] No sir. You are calibrated with the
[1:31:51] message. Amen. The message is you. Amen.
[1:31:56] Yes sir.
[1:31:58] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[1:32:00] together? Amen. Brother Brandham say
[1:32:04] because we always ought to ask what? Thy
[1:32:07] will be done. So it's a matter of will.
[1:32:10] Okay. Thy will be done. The will of who?
[1:32:13] God. And his will is his purpose. Amen.
[1:32:17] And if that is his will, his knows if
[1:32:20] that is his will. In other words, the
[1:32:23] know of God is the desire, the will of
[1:32:26] God. It is what God want.
[1:32:31] If that no is the will of God, it is a
[1:32:34] whole lot better.
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:38] Than if God would have say what? Because
[1:32:41] if God say yes, you go into permissive
[1:32:43] will. That's exactly right, brother.
[1:32:46] Because the no is better than the yes.
[1:32:48] Exactly right. That yes is not this yes.
[1:32:51] No sir. This yes is his will. But this
[1:32:55] yes is his permissive will. Amen. And
[1:32:58] that will bring you trouble. That's
[1:33:00] exactly right.
[1:33:03] Glory. Are we together? Amen. It's a
[1:33:06] whole lot better than his yeses. Amen.
[1:33:08] If it is his will to what? Do it. That
[1:33:10] is when you really do what? Love him.
[1:33:13] That's why I picked up this on Wednesday
[1:33:16] when brother Tony preaches. Look at
[1:33:18] these Hebrew children and Shadrach,
[1:33:22] Machu and Abednego, answer and say to
[1:33:26] the king, oh Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:33:30] we are not careful to answer thee this
[1:33:32] mother.
[1:33:36] In other words, we don't care about
[1:33:38] answering you. Yes. Because according to
[1:33:41] us either way we don't fail.
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:33:50] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:33:52] Amen. They say we are not even careful.
[1:33:55] We don't even care about answering you.
[1:33:58] If you need an answer for us, we don't
[1:34:00] even need to answer. There is no room
[1:34:03] for debate.
[1:34:04] [Applause]
[1:34:06] Nebuchadnezzar. There is no room for
[1:34:08] debate. If it comes to idolatry, we
[1:34:11] don't have room to argue. I don't need
[1:34:13] to give you court.
[1:34:18] I don't need to waste my time to give
[1:34:20] you court.
[1:34:22] I know whom I'm believing. Yes, sir.
[1:34:25] Yes, sir. And I'm persuaded.
[1:34:30] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:34:33] Now they say if it be so
[1:34:38] our God, Amen. Our God whom we serve is
[1:34:43] what? Amen.
[1:34:45] Because brother Brham say they pray all
[1:34:47] night.
[1:34:51] So they were expecting a yes.
[1:34:54] But watch those boys my friend. He say
[1:34:57] he's able to deliver us from what? The
[1:34:59] burning fiery furn. And if he will
[1:35:01] deliver and he will deliver us out of
[1:35:03] that hand or what king. But if not,
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:10] in other word,
[1:35:12] in other word, Nebuchadnezzar, we take
[1:35:15] yes and no.
[1:35:19] [Applause]
[1:35:20] If God say yes, fine. If he says no, we
[1:35:24] are fine. But just know one thing, we
[1:35:27] won't bow down.
[1:35:30] Amen.
[1:35:32] Amen.
[1:35:33] Maybe you didn't get me. If God answer
[1:35:37] my prayer, I stay in the message. If God
[1:35:40] didn't answer my prayer, I still stay in
[1:35:43] the message.
[1:35:45] Amen.
[1:35:47] Amen.
[1:35:50] It's a shame. It's a shame. Message
[1:35:54] believer, they didn't get their prayers.
[1:35:56] Now we start going to the Pentecostal
[1:35:58] preacher. Pentecostal preacher so and so
[1:36:00] can pray for me. That Pentecostal does
[1:36:03] miracle. No, no, no. I got the revealed
[1:36:06] word of the
[1:36:07] hour. God is with me. If he says no, I
[1:36:12] keep my position.
[1:36:15] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:19] Amen. My friend, quit listening to what
[1:36:22] you're listening on YouTube.
[1:36:24] Stay with the message.
[1:36:27] Yes. If God have not answered you yet,
[1:36:30] it's a matter of time. It's a matter of
[1:36:33] purpose. It's a matter of season.
[1:36:40] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:36:42] Amen. Glory to God. They say, "But if
[1:36:45] not, be known unto thee, oh king, that
[1:36:49] we will not serve thy God." Amen. Nor
[1:36:52] what? Worship the golden image which
[1:36:54] thou hast set up. In other word king, we
[1:36:57] have no, you don't understand us. Either
[1:37:00] way we go, we have we don't have any
[1:37:02] problem. If we come out of this, no
[1:37:04] problem. If we don't come out of this,
[1:37:06] we will be burned as a stick. But we
[1:37:08] won't bow down. And guess what?
[1:37:11] And guess what? When you begin to have
[1:37:14] that attitude,
[1:37:19] [Applause]
[1:37:22] when you begin to go before God and you
[1:37:24] say, "Either way, either way, I'm fine."
[1:37:27] God came down.
[1:37:30] Yes, he did. Are we together? Yes, sir.
[1:37:33] He didn't send an angel. Yes, sir. He
[1:37:36] didn't send an angel. He came down
[1:37:39] himself. He said, "These are my
[1:37:41] children. Let me identify myself with
[1:37:45] them because my no is better to them
[1:37:49] than my
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:55] Are we together? Brother Polyap, use
[1:37:58] that whistle, my friend.
[1:38:00] Ah, now we can preach together. Are we
[1:38:03] together? Are we together? Now, let's
[1:38:06] pick up Mama Zed.
[1:38:13] We found out three category.
[1:38:17] Are we together? We have just left the
[1:38:19] airport. We found out three category
[1:38:22] last Sunday. The first category is when
[1:38:26] your will,
[1:38:28] God's will is your will.
[1:38:32] Amen. We find that in Matthew 8 with the
[1:38:36] leper. You remember that? The leper
[1:38:38] came. He say Lord if it's thy will yes
[1:38:42] cleanse me. God say it is my will. So
[1:38:44] the will of the leper matches the will
[1:38:46] of Jesus Christ. Yes. We clear with mama
[1:38:52] zebed.
[1:38:55] Amen. Amen. With mama zebedi
[1:38:59] with his uh with her son John and James
[1:39:04] we found out that we got a mixed prayer.
[1:39:06] Yes sir.
[1:39:08] Amen. You you already understand this if
[1:39:11] you didn't the code the the whole sermon
[1:39:13] is there. So let's go to Matthew 20.
[1:39:16] Then we pick up. And the third category
[1:39:20] is when your
[1:39:21] will is
[1:39:23] different than God's will. Amen.
[1:39:28] In here it's a mix because some are with
[1:39:33] God's will. Sir,
[1:39:36] are we together? Uh-huh. And some of
[1:39:38] your requests are against God's will.
[1:39:43] So in other word, you come up with 20
[1:39:45] prayer requests.
[1:39:48] Amen. Are we together? And eight of them
[1:39:52] matches God.
[1:39:54] And you go with your faith and you find
[1:39:56] eight are happening but the other one
[1:39:58] are not happening yet. Amen. That's
[1:40:01] good. Because there is something that is
[1:40:03] going on with those.
[1:40:06] Either the time, either the season or
[1:40:11] the purpose, but some of them are going
[1:40:14] and you feel and you sitting, you say,
[1:40:15] "My God, I pray for this headache, the
[1:40:18] headache goes."
[1:40:20] So once the headache goes, you say,
[1:40:21] "Okay, okay, okay, let me take uh uh
[1:40:23] opportunity of this anointing now. Lord,
[1:40:26] can you take me out of my financial
[1:40:27] problem?"
[1:40:29] The financial trouble is is is
[1:40:31] lingering.
[1:40:33] [Applause]
[1:40:35] I'm I'm preaching to somebody now. You
[1:40:37] are confused.
[1:40:40] The headache work. This is not working.
[1:40:42] I have been praying for this for two
[1:40:44] years. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:48] Let's go to mama. My friend, let's go to
[1:40:51] Matthew 20. If you dare, you can say
[1:40:53] amen. Amen. My friend, we need to enter
[1:40:56] your life. Amen. Amen. Amen. Matthew 20.
[1:40:59] If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:41:02] Matthew 20. Let's go to verse 20. If I
[1:41:05] can go quickly on this.
[1:41:08] The Bible say, "Then came to him the
[1:41:10] mother of Zebed's children." You
[1:41:12] understand them now? With her son doing
[1:41:14] what? Worshiping him. So she started
[1:41:16] very good. That's right.
[1:41:19] We need to pray.
[1:41:22] Oh, believe.
[1:41:29] Oh. Ah. Now let's start praying.
[1:41:33] In other words, I'm believing it's
[1:41:35] going.
[1:41:38] Amen. Amen. After worshiping him and
[1:41:41] desiring now she's offering the request
[1:41:44] has started certain things of him. We
[1:41:47] need to know that certain things. And he
[1:41:49] said to her, "What will you?"
[1:41:52] Lord, help me. She says to him, "Grant
[1:41:55] that these matson, you know the sons
[1:41:58] already have thrones." You remember that
[1:42:00] they already gave them throne. The
[1:42:02] problem was already finished. Mom is
[1:42:04] coming not for throne. Mama now is
[1:42:07] coming for position.
[1:42:10] Make the throne a little bit higher
[1:42:13] than all the disciple.
[1:42:18] Ah my
[1:42:20] friend, everybody sitting on the same
[1:42:22] chair. No, no, no. Make that chair to be
[1:42:25] gold
[1:42:28] and that chair to be gold. So when
[1:42:30] people get in the church, the two chair,
[1:42:32] they know that those two are special
[1:42:34] people.
[1:42:37] Can I continue? Amen. Grant that these
[1:42:39] two sons may sit the one way that on thy
[1:42:43] right hand and the other on the left
[1:42:45] hand in your kingdom.
[1:42:48] The request is about the position.
[1:42:53] deposition but deposition not in this
[1:42:56] world in the kingdom of God.
[1:42:59] In other words, this mother is
[1:43:02] indirectly
[1:43:04] asking God for his children to be saved
[1:43:11] because those that enter this kingdom
[1:43:14] must be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:17] I'm going somewhere. Yes, sir. Are we
[1:43:20] together? Amen. So she's automatically
[1:43:23] asking for the Holy Spirit in here.
[1:43:25] Amen. Because only the Holy Spirit will
[1:43:27] put you on the kingdom. That's right.
[1:43:29] And then the first one is a is a
[1:43:31] position. But Jesus answer and say, "You
[1:43:35] know not what you ask."
[1:43:38] Are you able to drink of the cup
[1:43:42] that shall drink and to be baptized with
[1:43:45] the baptism that I baptize you? Now
[1:43:47] Jesus is splitting that right coming
[1:43:50] into the kingdom you need the Holy
[1:43:51] Ghost. Follow me. But to get a position
[1:43:55] of a throne you need suffering.
[1:44:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:44:02] Amen. To rule
[1:44:05] to rule
[1:44:07] you need to suffer.
[1:44:10] The Bible says this and then we
[1:44:12] continue. Paul says in 2 Timothy 2 uh
[1:44:16] Timothy 2:12, if we suffer,
[1:44:20] now we clear. I know you got quiet so
[1:44:23] that I I have to load this. If we
[1:44:25] suffer, we shall also what? Reign with
[1:44:28] him. So raining goes with what?
[1:44:31] Suffering. Are we together now? That's
[1:44:34] why Jesus is saying you want them to
[1:44:35] rain over there. Raining goes with
[1:44:37] suffering. We clear now? We clear now?
[1:44:41] Amen. All right. Now, and he says to
[1:44:44] them, "You shall," verse 23, "you shall
[1:44:47] indeed drink of my
[1:44:51] cup and be baptized." They are drinking
[1:44:54] not the cup but the cup of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:02] If I take this thing,
[1:45:05] you ready? Uh-huh. And I want to give
[1:45:08] water to
[1:45:11] uh brother
[1:45:13] Enoch. I will open this thing and take
[1:45:16] uh a cup and put it and put the water
[1:45:20] and give to brother Enoch. Go ahead. Are
[1:45:23] we together? That's brother Enoch cup.
[1:45:26] That's right.
[1:45:28] Are we together? If you need your cup,
[1:45:30] she say need what? I will take another
[1:45:33] cup. Right. Not brother Enoch cup.
[1:45:38] The only one who can drink brother Enoch
[1:45:42] cup
[1:45:43] must be somebody in the future
[1:45:47] because he's still single.
[1:45:53] I I don't know if you getting me sir.
[1:45:55] Now Jesus is telling them they will
[1:45:58] drink not the cup but my cup. So the
[1:46:02] disciple are sharing the same cup.
[1:46:05] That's right.
[1:46:08] Do you see which position they are?
[1:46:12] We understand one another. The Bible say
[1:46:14] you shall drink indeed of my cup and be
[1:46:17] baptized with the baptism. In other
[1:46:21] words, same thing that happened to
[1:46:22] Christ will happen to them. That's why
[1:46:25] Jesus said the work that I do. Right. In
[1:46:29] other words, these are part of the
[1:46:31] bride.
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:33] Because only the bride can drink the
[1:46:36] same cup.
[1:46:39] Amen. Are we together? He says, "And be
[1:46:44] baptized with the with the baptism I'm
[1:46:46] baptized with, but to sit
[1:46:50] on my right hand and on my left hand, it
[1:46:53] is not mine to give that one." Uh-uh.
[1:46:55] Mama, you hit uh uh the wrong button
[1:46:59] right here. I understand your desire but
[1:47:01] not we clear. He says but it shall be
[1:47:06] given to them for whom it is prepare of
[1:47:10] my father. So Jesus is preserving
[1:47:14] somebody's seat
[1:47:16] and making sure no one will take his
[1:47:18] seat. So no matter how much you pray,
[1:47:23] God won't give somebody seat. That's
[1:47:26] right.
[1:47:27] Are we together? Are we together? The
[1:47:30] Bible says in verse 24, "And when the 10
[1:47:34] heard it, remember they were moved with
[1:47:36] what? Indignation against the two what?
[1:47:39] Two brethren." They didn't give them the
[1:47:42] position, but they caught the intention.
[1:47:45] Yes. They say,
[1:47:47] "Ah, so both of you
[1:47:51] are intending to be above us."
[1:47:57] They got upset. Now Jesus is reacting.
[1:48:01] Watch my friend. Verse 25. But Jesus
[1:48:04] called them to him and say, "You know
[1:48:08] that the princes of the gentile,"
[1:48:10] brother Brandham used this for the
[1:48:11] nicolan spirit, right? The princes of
[1:48:14] the Gentile exercise dominion over them
[1:48:19] and that they and they that are great
[1:48:21] exercise authority upon them. In other
[1:48:23] words, they dominate the people. But it
[1:48:26] shall not be so. Among you, but
[1:48:30] whosoever will be great. In other words,
[1:48:33] let me change your concept of greatness.
[1:48:35] Yes, sir. You are upset because you are
[1:48:37] looking at somebody dominating you.
[1:48:40] That's not the case here. Whoever is
[1:48:42] great among you, let him be your what?
[1:48:46] Minister. And whoever will be chief
[1:48:49] among you, let him be uh let him be
[1:48:51] what? You're serving. Even as the son of
[1:48:54] man came not to be ministered to but to
[1:48:57] minister and to give his life a ransom
[1:49:00] for what? For many. So Jesus corrected
[1:49:02] the spirit. Amen. Yes. Among his
[1:49:05] disciple saying, "Hey, don't be here
[1:49:08] looking for higher position. Right.
[1:49:10] Right. And if you want to be the big
[1:49:13] shot among the people, you be the
[1:49:15] servant of all of them. In this world,
[1:49:17] we don't want that. Oh. Oh. Me serving
[1:49:21] everybody. I want people to serve me. I
[1:49:23] don't want to serve everybody. Jesus
[1:49:25] say, "Flip it around. You want to be
[1:49:26] great. Great means serve other. You're
[1:49:29] great means you are top and they serving
[1:49:31] you." Jesus said, "No, no, no. In my
[1:49:33] kingdom, you want to be great, go ahead
[1:49:35] and serve everybody." In other words, he
[1:49:37] change the concept when he says that.
[1:49:40] Everybody goes to their position. Are we
[1:49:43] together? So Jesus could not even answer
[1:49:47] that prayer. Are you following me?
[1:49:49] Number one, the purpose is wrong.
[1:49:52] [Applause]
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:55] It is not their position. Follow me my
[1:49:58] friend. They already got their position
[1:50:01] and this is where it's going to punch.
[1:50:03] Number two, Jesus caught the motive.
[1:50:06] [Applause]
[1:50:12] and the objective
[1:50:14] the motive was wrong.
[1:50:20] Amen. Don't worry, my friend. The Bible
[1:50:22] says in the book of James 4:3, "Ye ask
[1:50:28] and you receive God is saying no."
[1:50:32] Which he answer you because he asked
[1:50:35] how? Amen. that he may do what? Consume
[1:50:38] it upon your lust. Your motive is wrong.
[1:50:41] That's right. Your objective is wrong.
[1:50:44] God is saying no. Amen. And that no is
[1:50:47] better than the yeses.
[1:50:49] [Applause]
[1:50:51] Because if God give it to you, you will
[1:50:53] consume it with your last.
[1:50:57] In other words, you already have a
[1:50:59] project.
[1:51:00] I'm going to impress my friend.
[1:51:04] That is your project.
[1:51:06] So because you want to impress your
[1:51:08] friend, you come up with a request. You
[1:51:10] say, "God, I need a maseratica."
[1:51:15] God look at your heart. He said, "This
[1:51:17] is a problem right here." God say yes.
[1:51:20] Ask for big things, but for this no
[1:51:23] because if I say yes, tomorrow you'll be
[1:51:27] totally lost. That's right. You're going
[1:51:30] to be in trouble on campus.
[1:51:33] Are we together? Because you are asking
[1:51:36] wrong. The motive is wrong.
[1:51:40] Are we together? His nose are better
[1:51:43] than his yeses.
[1:51:46] Sometime your prayer matches his will.
[1:51:49] Sometime your prayer, some of them
[1:51:51] matches his will, some of them doesn't
[1:51:54] match. Sometime your will is completely
[1:51:59] contrary.
[1:52:02] enter God.
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:04] [Applause]
[1:52:05] And the best answer you can have as a
[1:52:08] child of God is no.
[1:52:11] Let's go to Luke 9.
[1:52:15] We just finished with the sons of uh
[1:52:17] Zebedee. What are their name? James and
[1:52:21] John. James and John. Can you repeat
[1:52:24] their name again? James and John. So
[1:52:26] James and John came with that request
[1:52:29] including their mother and they were
[1:52:31] three where three are gathered together
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:37] James, John and mama three are gathered
[1:52:40] together bring the request father you
[1:52:42] say you going to give it to us when
[1:52:45] father look you
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:49] say not this one
[1:52:52] mama are we there look and verse 51. If
[1:52:57] you dare, you can say amen. You're
[1:52:59] moving pretty good, my friend. Amen.
[1:53:04] If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:53:06] Please, if you stop here, we will push
[1:53:08] again. The traffic keep moving. So,
[1:53:10] let's go. You there? Amen. 51. Let's go,
[1:53:12] my friend. And it came to pass when the
[1:53:15] time was come that he should be receive
[1:53:18] up. In other words, Jesus need to die.
[1:53:21] Yes. Amen. To be receive up. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:25] He steadfastly,
[1:53:27] in other words, he decided to set his
[1:53:30] face to go to what? Jerusalem. He
[1:53:32] decided to go to Jerusalem knowing that
[1:53:34] it's time of his death. The lamb need to
[1:53:36] be killed there. You following me? Amen.
[1:53:39] Who are the sons of Zebedee? James and
[1:53:42] John. Okay. Verse 52. And sent messenger
[1:53:46] messengers before his face. And they
[1:53:48] went and enter into a
[1:53:51] village of the Samaritan to make ready
[1:53:55] for
[1:53:56] him. And they did not receive him. The
[1:54:00] Samaritan say who? Jesus Christ. Hey,
[1:54:04] get out.
[1:54:06] Amen. And they didn't receive him
[1:54:09] because his face was as though he will
[1:54:12] go to what? Jerusalem. They said Jesus,
[1:54:15] where is he going? To Jerusalem. He's
[1:54:17] going to the Jews. Why is he coming this
[1:54:19] way? Right. Amen. We got segregation.
[1:54:23] Right. That's right. Amen. He's going
[1:54:24] over there so he can't come here. So
[1:54:27] continue,
[1:54:29] brother. Continue. We don't have a time
[1:54:32] for you to preach.
[1:54:37] It is not the truth.
[1:54:40] Because you go into the click. There it
[1:54:42] is. Keep on moving.
[1:54:45] Have I said something wrong? Keep on
[1:54:47] moving my brother. Are we together? Keep
[1:54:50] on moving.
[1:54:52] Verse 54. And when his disciple who
[1:54:56] James and John again
[1:55:00] who was the sons of Zebedee? James and
[1:55:03] John. Who is here again? James and John.
[1:55:05] So the sons of Zebedee again.
[1:55:09] Now when his disciple James and who John
[1:55:13] saw this they say Lord
[1:55:16] prayer request
[1:55:20] prayer request
[1:55:22] is my Bible different than yours? They
[1:55:24] say Lord look how they calling him Lord
[1:55:27] Elohim
[1:55:29] Lord will you that we command fire.
[1:55:36] to come down from heaven
[1:55:39] and consume them. Look how they are
[1:55:42] backing with the scripture.
[1:55:45] Come on, brother. My friend, we're
[1:55:47] talking about our prayer. He says,
[1:55:50] consume them even as who? Elias. In
[1:55:54] other words, they're telling Jesus
[1:55:55] Christ, father, as Elijah spoke for the
[1:55:58] fire, you say, bring your word and you
[1:56:02] stay with your word. So in the name of
[1:56:04] Jesus Christ as you did for Elijah, you
[1:56:06] are still the same yesterday, today and
[1:56:08] forever. Give me father. So let me cook
[1:56:11] these people.
[1:56:16] Because they are refusing you. Whoever
[1:56:19] is your enemy is my enemy.
[1:56:22] Take your time.
[1:56:24] That's right. Who? James and John again.
[1:56:29] Yes, sir. My God.
[1:56:33] That's why Jesus have to change their
[1:56:35] name.
[1:56:40] And Jesus called them the sons of
[1:56:42] thunder.
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:46] In other words, the sons of the voice of
[1:56:48] God
[1:56:51] because the nature is not good. So Jesus
[1:56:54] have to give them a new name. And Jesus
[1:56:57] hid them in the pond.
[1:57:03] John love James Hope. He put them under
[1:57:07] the thunder.
[1:57:09] [Applause]
[1:57:14] My God. Are we together? Are we
[1:57:16] together? Reaction of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:19] Verse 55. But he turned and rebuked
[1:57:23] them. Yes. In other words, guys, stop
[1:57:26] your prayer. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[1:57:30] He rebuked them and said, "You know not
[1:57:32] what manner of spirit you are of.
[1:57:36] For the son of man is not come to do
[1:57:38] what? Destroy men's lives, but to do
[1:57:41] what?" To save them. So sometime your
[1:57:43] prayer is contrary
[1:57:45] [Applause]
[1:57:49] to the word of God. And because of that,
[1:57:53] God must answer no. If not, you will
[1:57:57] barbecue people.
[1:57:58] [Applause]
[1:58:04] You are driving on the road and somebody
[1:58:06] keeps slowing down on a fast lane. Keep
[1:58:09] slowing down and you keep going. You
[1:58:12] keep going and you pass them and you
[1:58:14] give them that look and you say, "Wait
[1:58:17] for the third
[1:58:21] pool. The third pool won't come my
[1:58:24] friend because you will fry them. You
[1:58:27] will f them on the highway.
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:32] [Laughter]
[1:58:34] Are we together? Sometime your will is
[1:58:37] God's will.
[1:58:40] Sometime yes some of your prayer matches
[1:58:43] some doesn't match. Sometime you are
[1:58:45] completely offline.
[1:58:48] You are disconnected.
[1:58:50] You got into the corner mind. Somebody
[1:58:54] poke you the wrong way. You say father
[1:58:57] fire fire.
[1:59:01] You should heal Pentecost.
[1:59:03] I'm sending them fire. Fire. Which fire?
[1:59:08] Which fire?
[1:59:16] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:59:21] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:59:23] Amen. That's why brother Brandham says
[1:59:26] this. Brother Brandham say God never
[1:59:29] change
[1:59:31] his mind or what? His word. But he will
[1:59:34] give you what? The desire of his heart.
[1:59:36] Of your what? Of your heart. He promised
[1:59:39] that. You know that. Amen. He promised
[1:59:42] to give you what? The desire of your
[1:59:44] heart. Let your desire
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:49] be the word of God. Amen.
[1:59:52] Amen. Amen. Because brother Brandham
[1:59:55] said the will of God is the word of God.
[1:59:57] I already gave you the quote on that
[1:59:59] one. Brother Brandham said, "Let your
[2:00:01] desire be his word." Amen. He said, "Let
[2:00:04] your desire be the word of God." Let
[2:00:07] what? Your desire be what? His will
[2:00:09] because he's going to work everything
[2:00:12] according to his own will. In other
[2:00:14] word, match your desire to his will.
[2:00:17] Amen. Then you are sure you're going to
[2:00:19] get it. He's saying let your desire be
[2:00:22] what? His will. Never what? Your own
[2:00:25] will. But how? His will. If you ask him
[2:00:29] for something, he don't give it to you.
[2:00:31] What do you say? Thank you, Lord. You
[2:00:34] know what is good?
[2:00:39] Let me read it again. My friend, brother
[2:00:42] Brham say, if you ask God for something
[2:00:45] and he doesn't give it to you, what do
[2:00:47] you say? Thank you, Lord. You know what
[2:00:50] is what? Good.
[2:00:54] I'm not going to say God didn't answer
[2:00:56] my prayer.
[2:00:58] God knows what is good. There is a
[2:01:00] purpose why he didn't give me this. Are
[2:01:04] we together? That's why to help us.
[2:01:08] That's it. Amen. From
[2:01:12] humanity which is our will.
[2:01:15] versus divine purpose which is God's
[2:01:18] will.
[2:01:20] God sent us the Holy Spirit. Follow me,
[2:01:24] my friend. Amen. Are we together? The
[2:01:26] Bible says in Romans
[2:01:28] 8:26, likewise the who? The spirit.
[2:01:31] Uh-huh. Also does what? Helpeth our
[2:01:34] infirmities. For we know not. That's it.
[2:01:37] What we should pray for as we ought. In
[2:01:41] other words, sometime you don't know how
[2:01:42] to pray. That's why Jesus told Mama
[2:01:45] Zebed, you don't know what you're asking
[2:01:48] because of a lack of the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:53] He said, "For we know not what we should
[2:01:55] pray for as we ought, but the spirit
[2:02:00] himself dri maketh intercession for for
[2:02:03] us with what? Groanings which cannot be
[2:02:06] what uttered." In other words, the Holy
[2:02:08] Spirit become the advocate.
[2:02:11] Amen. He said, "I see what he's looking
[2:02:14] for, but he doesn't know how to explain
[2:02:15] it. He keep getting decline, decline,
[2:02:18] decline." No, no, no, no. Let me let me
[2:02:20] tell you the way you get these things.
[2:02:24] You need to tell God this way.
[2:02:28] Tell him when you heal me, I will serve
[2:02:31] you more.
[2:02:33] Amen. And make sure you mean it from
[2:02:35] your heart.
[2:02:37] When you mean it, then he's going to
[2:02:39] give it to you. But what you have in
[2:02:41] your heart is for you to go back to the
[2:02:43] world. That's why he's blocking it.
[2:02:48] Are we together? Are we together? He
[2:02:52] says, "But the spirit itself maketh
[2:02:54] intercession with for us with groaning
[2:02:57] which cannot be what?" uttered. And he
[2:02:59] that searchth the heart knoweth what is
[2:03:02] the what? Mind of the spirit. because he
[2:03:05] maketh intercession for the saints
[2:03:08] according to what? The will of God.
[2:03:11] Because the in other words, the Holy
[2:03:12] Spirit will never deviate from the will
[2:03:15] of God. Amen. The Holy Spirit is God.
[2:03:18] Amen. The Holy Spirit knows your
[2:03:20] purpose. Amen. So when the Holy Spirit
[2:03:23] is praying, he knows what to pray. Amen.
[2:03:27] He knows what to tell God about you.
[2:03:30] Amen.
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:31] [Applause]
[2:03:32] Amen. Amen. I don't know if you're
[2:03:34] getting me. If your purpose is
[2:03:37] Coca-Cola, you praying for Fanta. When
[2:03:40] the Holy Spirit come, he go straight. He
[2:03:42] say, "Give him Coca-Cola." Correct. And
[2:03:45] tomorrow you get an answer. You say,
[2:03:46] "Praise God." God answered me. I got a
[2:03:49] drink. Yes. Your drink was Coca-Cola.
[2:03:52] The Holy Spirit knows. Are we together?
[2:03:55] Because the Holy Spirit is God. He's the
[2:03:57] one that gave the promise. Amen. That's
[2:04:00] why Paul says this, my friend. Paul says
[2:04:02] in Ephesians 6, he say praying how
[2:04:05] always with all prayer
[2:04:09] and what? Supplication. Be careful.
[2:04:12] Worry for nothing. Yes sir. You remember
[2:04:15] that? But in everything by what? Prayer.
[2:04:18] And what? Supplication. Let your
[2:04:20] requests be known unto the Lord. Now
[2:04:23] Paul is saying for your prayer and
[2:04:25] supplication. Do you follow me? Paul say
[2:04:28] praying always with what? All prayers
[2:04:30] and what and supplication? In the
[2:04:33] spirit. Yes. In other words, Paul is
[2:04:37] saying when you want to pray, make sure
[2:04:39] you are in the spirit. Amen. Amen.
[2:04:42] Because the spirit will know Yes, sir.
[2:04:45] what is needed for your life. And the
[2:04:47] Holy Spirit will intercede
[2:04:51] in other words, the Holy Spirit will
[2:04:53] begin to pray for you. Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:04:56] Knowing who you are and what God purpose
[2:04:59] for your life.
[2:05:01] Amen. Amen. Paul says praying always
[2:05:04] with all prayer where and supplication
[2:05:07] how? In the spirit and watching there
[2:05:09] unto with all perseverance and
[2:05:11] supplication for what? All saints.
[2:05:13] Brother Steven you say praying in the
[2:05:15] spirit.
[2:05:17] In this message we spoke many things.
[2:05:19] Sometime we don't even understand. What
[2:05:22] does praying in the spirit mean?
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:28] Because if I go home. Yeah, I
[2:05:30] understand. You say God is saying the
[2:05:33] Holy Spirit pray for me. I got the
[2:05:35] point. You say that do not worry for
[2:05:38] nothing by everything. Prayer
[2:05:41] supplication. Now Paul is saying prayer
[2:05:43] and supplication not in humanity. No
[2:05:46] sir,
[2:05:48] in the Holy Spirit. Now brother Steven,
[2:05:50] how can I pray in the Holy Spirit? Amen.
[2:05:53] What does praying in the spirit mean?
[2:06:00] Because if not, you will just go with an
[2:06:02] intellectual
[2:06:04] understanding. Pray in the spirit. Pray
[2:06:06] in the spirit. You don't know what pray
[2:06:07] in the spirit means. We need a prophet
[2:06:11] to tell us what is praying in the
[2:06:13] spirit. Yes sir. Yes sir. Come on, Lord.
[2:06:18] Are we together? Brother Brham says this
[2:06:21] in the message. Is there anything too
[2:06:24] hard for the Lord? Brother Brandham
[2:06:26] said, "Then I climb up a little farther
[2:06:28] into the secret
[2:06:31] and I knelt down. The mosquitoes
[2:06:34] was just humming all around my ear." In
[2:06:37] other words, the mosquitoes knows that
[2:06:39] you want to pray. So the devil anoint
[2:06:42] mosquitoes.
[2:06:44] [Applause]
[2:06:47] You don't believe this thing.
[2:06:50] You don't believe these things. Brother
[2:06:52] Brandham say in the millennium there
[2:06:55] won't be no lion tearing down beast.
[2:06:59] Brother Brandham said the reason why a
[2:07:01] lion is catching a beast and tearing. He
[2:07:03] say it's the devil. Because in the
[2:07:05] garden of Eden the lion was not doing
[2:07:08] that. The lion was doing something
[2:07:10] different. You want me this? Yes sir.
[2:07:13] Praise God. Praise God. Do you hear me?
[2:07:16] Yeah. In the Garden of Eden, the lion
[2:07:18] was doing something different. That's
[2:07:20] why the Bible say in the millennium, the
[2:07:23] lion will be eating grass,
[2:07:27] not steak.
[2:07:29] No steak in the millennium. So, you
[2:07:31] better take advantage now.
[2:07:36] Because in the millennium, nothing dies.
[2:07:41] Are we together? Are we together? So the
[2:07:44] brother Brandham is saying he's trying
[2:07:46] to pray and what happened is mosquito
[2:07:49] begins to to b him. Who's sending
[2:07:52] mosquitoes?
[2:07:54] Now you begin to understand. Brother
[2:07:56] Brandham say the mosquitoes were just
[2:07:59] ramming all around my ears and I
[2:08:02] couldn't hardly pray.
[2:08:06] It is the devil the prince of the power
[2:08:09] of the air.
[2:08:11] Brother, brother say when you have those
[2:08:12] hurricane, it is the devil. It is
[2:08:16] demonic spirit and they give them human
[2:08:18] name.
[2:08:21] Are we together? It's a demon right
[2:08:24] there. Amen. And the and brother
[2:08:27] Brandham say I believe then it was who?
[2:08:30] The devil. Ah. So who was who using uh
[2:08:33] mosquitoes?
[2:08:36] So I say, "Oh Lord, be merciful." I just
[2:08:41] threw up my hands and start praying
[2:08:44] anyhow and just let the mosquito fill up
[2:08:48] if they wish to. So brother begin to
[2:08:51] pray. Lord Jesus, Father, I love you.
[2:08:58] He changes the position. Lord, you are
[2:09:01] the master of
[2:09:05] You know what? Let's go. Lord Jesus, you
[2:09:09] are the master. Keep keep doing whatever
[2:09:11] you want to do.
[2:09:14] I'm I'm trying to help somebody. Brother
[2:09:17] say, I just threw up my hand and start
[2:09:20] praying anyhow and just let the mosquito
[2:09:23] do what? Fill up if they wish to. But
[2:09:25] there was something that was burdening
[2:09:27] in my heart. Amen. I have a request. Yes
[2:09:30] sir. Are we together? And after I become
[2:09:34] so lost
[2:09:37] in prayer, I guess you Christian know
[2:09:40] what it means to be how? Lost in prayer.
[2:09:45] Just forget where you are. That is
[2:09:48] praying in the
[2:09:54] s. Amen. Amen. When you pray in your
[2:09:58] corner mind, you know who's beside you.
[2:10:02] There it is right there, brother. Yes,
[2:10:03] sir. That's the truth. And some of the
[2:10:06] requests are silenced
[2:10:08] because you don't want the neighbor to
[2:10:10] hear them.
[2:10:12] Especially if it's confession,
[2:10:15] Lord Jesus.
[2:10:17] And then you go back up again
[2:10:21] because you know that s is uh is uh
[2:10:24] sister Kella is right here and brother
[2:10:26] John P is right here. He's going to say
[2:10:28] ah this brother
[2:10:31] hey so you go you say oh brother pray
[2:10:34] pray pray I'm praying I'm praying I'm
[2:10:35] praying I'm praying in my heart you know
[2:10:38] why you praying in your heart because
[2:10:39] you are conscious of your environment.
[2:10:42] Yes, but when you forget your
[2:10:44] environment.
[2:10:45] That's right. And you say, "Lord, I came
[2:10:47] to this church. I am not going home the
[2:10:50] same. I don't care who's on my right,
[2:10:53] who's on my left. I'm going to pray
[2:10:55] until I get the answer." You say,
[2:10:58] "Father, you the God of heaven. Before
[2:11:01] you know it, your mind is lost. You got
[2:11:04] in the spirit." Yes, sir. At that time
[2:11:07] God take over
[2:11:10] because you won't worry about the
[2:11:12] grammar. You don't worry about the
[2:11:14] camera. It is not you praying. It is the
[2:11:18] Holy Spirit taking over your request.
[2:11:21] That is what praying in the spirit
[2:11:24] is. Glory.
[2:11:27] That's why brother Brham say we do our
[2:11:30] best prayer at home. That's in the
[2:11:32] closet because nobody's around.
[2:11:37] Are we together? Amen. Brother Brandham
[2:11:39] say that he's praying where in the
[2:11:41] spirit. I believe I open my eyes and
[2:11:44] just the side of a little dog wood bush
[2:11:47] there was that light hanging there. That
[2:11:50] light shining down to where I was and
[2:11:52] say rise and go by the way of water. In
[2:11:56] other words, when you move that way, the
[2:11:58] Holy Spirit will come down. Are we
[2:12:00] together? So the lesson right here is
[2:12:02] what my friend brother say you can't do
[2:12:06] any good until first you get where in
[2:12:09] the spirit God can use you no sir all
[2:12:13] your effort are in vain until first you
[2:12:16] do what in the spirit if you sing what
[2:12:19] do you do I will sing in the spirit
[2:12:22] [Applause]
[2:12:25] if you want to sing a special what do
[2:12:27] you do sing in the spirit in other words
[2:12:30] forget Who's right here?
[2:12:32] Yes, sir.
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:35] Forget about here. Close your eyes. Yes,
[2:12:38] sir. Take yourself up
[2:12:40] somewhere and you will see the anointing
[2:12:42] of God coming down because somebody is
[2:12:45] gone in the spirit. Yes, sir. If you're
[2:12:48] not in the spirit, don't sing. It is
[2:12:51] mechanic.
[2:12:53] It is
[2:12:54] mechanic. But when you get to the
[2:12:56] spirit, the dynamic have come. The
[2:13:00] anointing fall and somebody's blessed.
[2:13:05] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:13:09] Yes sir. Brother say if I will sing I
[2:13:12] will sing where? In the spirit. If I
[2:13:14] pray I will pray how? In the spirit. And
[2:13:17] then if there is anything that comes to
[2:13:19] me that is any good, it has to be
[2:13:21] revealed to me by the spirit and confirm
[2:13:24] how? By the word. So God sent us the
[2:13:27] spirit. Amen. to help us correct these
[2:13:30] things are here. Amen. So that when the
[2:13:33] Holy Spirit pick up, you won't go
[2:13:35] contrary to the word. When the Holy
[2:13:38] Spirit pick up, he will bring your
[2:13:39] prayer from three, two, all the way to
[2:13:42] one. Where your prayer are matching
[2:13:45] God's will. And when your prayer matches
[2:13:47] God's will, then we know that our answer
[2:13:50] are guaranteed. Are we together, my
[2:13:52] friend? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are
[2:13:55] we clear? Amen. Let's pick an example.
[2:13:59] of how our will need to be his will
[2:14:02] before we get into Christ.
[2:14:05] Let's go to Esther.
[2:14:09] Amen.
[2:14:11] My time is good. Praise God.
[2:14:16] Glory to
[2:14:19] God. Praise
[2:14:21] God. Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] I'm praying. I'm praying nothing
[2:14:32] happened. Unless you a child of the
[2:14:34] devil.
[2:14:41] If you're a child of God, God hears your
[2:14:43] prayer
[2:14:46] always. God will hear your prayer. Wait
[2:14:48] when I get to Jesus Christ if I can
[2:14:51] cross Esther quickly.
[2:14:53] Amen. Amen. Let's go to Esther 2. I
[2:14:56] cannot touch Esther because we we preach
[2:14:58] Esther. I don't know how many series. So
[2:15:01] if you ever touch it again, you're going
[2:15:02] to get lost sooner in a few minutes. You
[2:15:05] there? You there? Let's touch up the
[2:15:08] surface quickly to make a point to what
[2:15:10] we just spoke.
[2:15:12] Essay, you can say amen. Now in Shushan
[2:15:16] the palace, there was a certain Jew
[2:15:19] whose name was who? Mori. the son of
[2:15:22] Jer, the son of Sheime, the son of Kish,
[2:15:24] a what? A Benjamite. You know, they call
[2:15:27] him a Jew, but Jews were from the tribe
[2:15:30] of Judah. But if you notice, if you
[2:15:32] study the Bible, you will find out that
[2:15:34] when Israel split, 10 tribe went the
[2:15:38] other way. And the tribe of Benjamin
[2:15:40] cling to the tribe of Judah. That's why
[2:15:42] the Benjamite became Jews. We clear? You
[2:15:45] need those scripture? You ask me. Job to
[2:15:47] verse seven. And he brought up Hadassa.
[2:15:51] Sister Hadassa is right there.
[2:15:54] Hada, that is Esther. That's right. His
[2:15:59] uncle's daughter. For
[2:16:01] she had neither father
[2:16:04] nor what? Mother. Esther has what?
[2:16:08] Neither father nor what? Mother.
[2:16:13] Did you get something? You didn't get it
[2:16:15] yet. Esther has neither what? Father,
[2:16:18] no. What? Mother under the lineage of
[2:16:21] Mechisedc.
[2:16:24] [Applause]
[2:16:25] [Laughter]
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:29] Do you see this Bible is beautiful? It
[2:16:31] takes the message of brother Brana. He
[2:16:34] say she have neither mother nor what?
[2:16:36] Father. And the man was fair and
[2:16:39] beautiful whom Modi when her father and
[2:16:42] mother were dead took him uh took for
[2:16:46] his own what? Daughter. So they were
[2:16:48] cousin. We clear?
[2:16:50] Job to verse 8. So it came to pass when
[2:16:53] the king's commandment, you know this
[2:16:55] story, and his decree was heard, his
[2:16:57] decree was heard, and when many men were
[2:17:00] gathered together to Shushan to uh the
[2:17:03] palace, that the custody to the custody
[2:17:06] of Heg that Esther was brought also to
[2:17:09] the king's house, to the custody of Heg,
[2:17:12] keeper of the women. We clear, right?
[2:17:15] Amen. And the maiden pleased him. Favor,
[2:17:18] brother Tony. And she obtained kindness
[2:17:21] of him. And he speedily gave her things
[2:17:24] for purification with such as belongth
[2:17:27] to her. And seven maiden. Why only
[2:17:30] seven? Let's leave it alone, my friend.
[2:17:33] Which were meant to be given her out of
[2:17:36] the king house. And he prefer her and
[2:17:38] her maid to the best place of the house
[2:17:42] of the woman. Of the women. We clear
[2:17:44] there. Now Esther, follow me now, had
[2:17:48] not showed her people nor her kindred,
[2:17:53] for Morcai had charged her that he
[2:17:56] should that she should not show it. In
[2:17:58] other words, Esther is called,
[2:18:02] picked up,
[2:18:04] selected, put in the palace with unknown
[2:18:09] identity. Amen.
[2:18:12] In other words, nobody know really who
[2:18:14] Esther is. Are you following me? We
[2:18:18] clear my friend. Job 2 verse uh
[2:18:22] 17. If you dare, you can say amen. And
[2:18:25] the king loved Esther above all the
[2:18:29] women. And she obtained grace and favor,
[2:18:32] brother Tony, in his sight more than
[2:18:36] all the virgin. So that he set the royal
[2:18:40] crown upon her head and made her queen
[2:18:44] instead of who? Vash. So Esther is
[2:18:48] called. Yes. You following me? Selected,
[2:18:53] chosen, and position. Are we clear? Let
[2:18:58] me start it again. Esther is called,
[2:19:02] selected, chosen, and position as a
[2:19:06] queen. If you notice there is no
[2:19:09] trouble.
[2:19:12] There's no problem. Amen. Esther is
[2:19:15] positioned as a queen. Right? We clear?
[2:19:18] Amen. Job to verse uh
[2:19:21] 20. Esther had not yet showed her
[2:19:24] kindred nor her people as Morci has
[2:19:28] charged her. For Esther did the
[2:19:30] commandment of Mordei like as when she
[2:19:33] was brought up with him. In other words,
[2:19:35] her identity is sealed. We don't know
[2:19:38] who she is, but she's already selected,
[2:19:42] called, chosen, position, but we don't
[2:19:45] know who she is. Are we together? Are we
[2:19:48] clear? Go to chapter
[2:19:51] three. Verse one. If you there, you can
[2:19:54] say amen. Amen. The Bible say after
[2:19:57] these things, which things?
[2:20:01] The calling,
[2:20:02] the selection,
[2:20:04] the choosing and the positioning of
[2:20:07] Esther. In other word, everything about
[2:20:10] Esther is finished.
[2:20:15] This is when trouble start.
[2:20:20] Are we together? After these things did
[2:20:24] King
[2:20:24] Ahazarus promote who? Amen. So Hermon
[2:20:28] was now promoted
[2:20:31] before Esther was first position.
[2:20:38] Help me preach my friend. My time is
[2:20:39] going.
[2:20:41] I don't know if you get me because we
[2:20:43] know who Amon represent.
[2:20:46] Amen represent who? The devil. He
[2:20:49] represent the devil. Because when they
[2:20:52] ask a man, they say who? How can we
[2:20:55] treat?
[2:20:57] a man that the king would like to honor.
[2:21:00] Do you know what Hmon says? I want to
[2:21:03] take that man and put the king crown on
[2:21:06] him. The king clothing on him and the
[2:21:09] king uh uh I mean donkey on him. In
[2:21:12] other words, Amen wanted to be the king
[2:21:18] and there is one person that we know in
[2:21:21] the Bible that wanted to be like the
[2:21:23] most high. Amen. The Bible say he was
[2:21:27] Lucifer who wanted to be like the most
[2:21:30] high.
[2:21:32] So Amen is a perfect type of Satan.
[2:21:36] But Amen cannot be positioned before
[2:21:40] Esther. Esther is first
[2:21:43] call
[2:21:45] selected chosen position before Amen.
[2:21:53] I don't know if you get what I'm saying.
[2:21:55] You were chosen. You were called. You
[2:21:59] were positioned before the devil was
[2:22:02] created.
[2:22:07] Yes, sir.
[2:22:10] I don't know if you get what I'm saying.
[2:22:13] In other words, after your position,
[2:22:16] that's when God create the devil.
[2:22:19] Your position is what create the devil.
[2:22:24] That's why the devil want to be like the
[2:22:26] most high. He want to climb above the
[2:22:29] star of God. Above you because you were
[2:22:32] before him.
[2:22:38] I don't know if we together. The Bible
[2:22:41] says that Satan, the devil, Lucifer want
[2:22:44] to go above the star of God. and the
[2:22:47] star of God were the children of God. So
[2:22:50] the devil wanted to surpass you, but the
[2:22:53] only one above you was God
[2:22:56] as a husband. But he's also equal to
[2:22:59] you. So the devil want to be you. But
[2:23:03] before God positioned the devil, God
[2:23:06] first must finish your work.
[2:23:12] You are picked
[2:23:15] selected. chosen
[2:23:18] position before the foundation of the
[2:23:21] world
[2:23:23] before God start creating the devil.
[2:23:26] What I'm trying to say is this. The
[2:23:29] trouble you going through
[2:23:32] [Applause]
[2:23:35] the demon that is troubling you,
[2:23:39] remind that demon I existed before you.
[2:23:47] [Applause]
[2:23:49] I don't know if you get what I'm saying.
[2:23:51] Tell that demon, you say you demon of
[2:23:54] lust. No one thing when they were
[2:23:57] creating you, I was already there.
[2:24:00] In other words, I am above you.
[2:24:07] God took my identity and hid my
[2:24:10] identity. But now the time has come
[2:24:14] You will know who I am
[2:24:20] because when God was creating you, I was
[2:24:23] clapping hand.
[2:24:26] I saw you.
[2:24:28] [Applause]
[2:24:28] [Music]
[2:24:29] I don't know if you get me.
[2:24:32] Tell that
[2:24:33] demon tell that demon of diabetes say
[2:24:37] let me tell you your story. Before you
[2:24:41] became demon, you were first an angel.
[2:24:44] You were first serving God. I was there.
[2:24:49] And when we fought in heaven, I fought
[2:24:51] you and then I overcame you. So if
[2:24:56] [Applause]
[2:25:03] I doing okay, are we together? Are we
[2:25:07] together?
[2:25:09] Jesus say when you pray you say let your
[2:25:13] will be done well
[2:25:16] be done well where on earth as it is
[2:25:19] what in heaven in heaven I overcame you
[2:25:23] so the wind of heaven must come down to
[2:25:26] the
[2:25:30] earth blood pressure I'm going to
[2:25:33] overcome you
[2:25:35] here arthritis we going to finish
[2:25:39] Before you were created, I was there.
[2:25:50] [Applause]
[2:25:52] Position.
[2:25:54] Position goes with power. In other
[2:25:57] words, I was in charge. I was in power
[2:26:01] before you, Satan.
[2:26:03] [Applause]
[2:26:07] In other word, you have a knowledge.
[2:26:13] In other word, you have a knowledge that
[2:26:17] Satan doesn't have because you existed
[2:26:20] before him.
[2:26:24] [Applause]
[2:26:30] Where are we at, my friend? I don't
[2:26:32] think I will cross. I will touch Jesus
[2:26:34] Christ.
[2:26:39] [Applause]
[2:26:42] [Music]
[2:26:43] [Applause]
[2:26:46] was created before you.
[2:26:50] Maybe you don't understand my language.
[2:26:54] Maybe you don't understand my language.
[2:26:56] Let me tell you in plain word. You were
[2:26:59] never even been created. You always
[2:27:04] were. Yes.
[2:27:08] You are eternal.
[2:27:12] God only position you. And when God
[2:27:16] finish your work, then he created Satan.
[2:27:21] What are you scared about?
[2:27:27] Depression. You a small dick.
[2:27:32] Let me say it this way. Let me say it
[2:27:34] this way. Tell the demon of depression,
[2:27:38] I was changing your diaper. Yes.
[2:27:44] When you were a baby, I was there. I
[2:27:47] changed your diaper. So there is nothing
[2:27:50] you can do to me.
[2:27:53] [Applause]
[2:27:54] [Music]
[2:27:55] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[2:27:58] together? Amen. Are we together? Church,
[2:28:02] where are we at?
[2:28:04] Verse verse one. Let's go to chapter 3,
[2:28:07] verse one.
[2:28:11] I only have seven minutes left. The
[2:28:14] Bible says after these things did King
[2:28:17] Ahazarus did what? Promote Hmon. Why
[2:28:20] didn't he promote Hmon before Esther?
[2:28:25] In other words, when Ammon is coming
[2:28:26] into position, Esther is already the
[2:28:29] queen.
[2:28:31] Yes, sir. Qualify queen
[2:28:35] with a hidden identity.
[2:28:39] [Applause]
[2:28:42] with a hidden identity. And there is a
[2:28:45] purpose why they have to hide you under
[2:28:48] the thunder.
[2:28:53] [Applause]
[2:28:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. He says
[2:29:01] after this thing did king Ahazarus
[2:29:04] promote Hmon the son of Hammedada the
[2:29:08] who? The eagite. Do you know what egite
[2:29:11] means? Uh-huh. Eggat is an Amalachite.
[2:29:17] A he was he come from the lineage of the
[2:29:20] king of Agat who was the king of the
[2:29:23] Amalachite. So Hmon escaped from the
[2:29:26] Amalach.
[2:29:29] But God sold
[2:29:31] to Moses that I will have fight with
[2:29:35] Amalecch until I wipe Amalcch. So the
[2:29:38] last descendant of Amalecch is right
[2:29:41] here. And to defeat him, he was not a
[2:29:44] man, a woman.
[2:29:55] God didn't choose a man. God chose a
[2:29:58] woman. God can fight the devil. He's
[2:30:03] using the bread.
[2:30:08] Amen.
[2:30:11] Because she is him.
[2:30:16] Hallelujah.
[2:30:18] Are we together, my friend?
[2:30:21] Where are we at, my friend? Verse two.
[2:30:23] The son of Hameta the who? The Hegite
[2:30:26] and did what? Advanced him and set his
[2:30:29] seat where? Above all the princes that
[2:30:31] were with him. Where?
[2:30:34] That were with him. That were with him.
[2:30:36] Amen. So Hmon is position after Esther.
[2:30:41] Amen. You come first.
[2:30:45] You existed
[2:30:47] first. Yes.
[2:30:50] Are we together? In other words, when
[2:30:52] you existed first, you got the solution.
[2:30:55] [Applause]
[2:30:57] Because the devil was designed based on
[2:31:01] your position.
[2:31:06] Satan was designed never to match you.
[2:31:11] Satan can never be converted.
[2:31:14] success.
[2:31:16] [Applause]
[2:31:17] Satan was designed to develop you
[2:31:22] exactly right
[2:31:26] to reveal who you are.
[2:31:31] Yes, sir.
[2:31:35] Who is the queen? Esther. Which tribe is
[2:31:38] she from?
[2:31:40] We don't know.
[2:31:42] Is she a Persian? We don't know. You ask
[2:31:47] silence of the seven zero. Only Mai have
[2:31:50] the answer.
[2:31:55] Only
[2:31:56] Modai have the answer.
[2:32:01] Only William Marion
[2:32:03] Brham have the answer. Only Brham have
[2:32:08] the answer.
[2:32:11] [Applause]
[2:32:15] Glory to God. Are we together? Please
[2:32:18] help me fly, my friend. Go to chapter 4.
[2:32:23] Go to chapter 4. We skip this quickly,
[2:32:25] my friend. Go to chapter 4. This church,
[2:32:28] we we leave Esther and then we pick up
[2:32:30] Esther in another way. We there. Amen.
[2:32:33] Just go to chapter 4. You there? Amen.
[2:32:36] Verse uh 13.
[2:32:39] Hmon begin to cause the trouble.
[2:32:42] And do you know the trouble of Hmon? He
[2:32:45] was against the Jew.
[2:32:47] But didn't know that the queen
[2:32:50] is a hidden Jew.
[2:32:56] [Applause]
[2:33:00] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:33:03] Then the news came
[2:33:06] and Modcai sent Esther the news. Are we
[2:33:10] together? Esther got the news. He say,
[2:33:12] "Hey, Modica, I understand what you're
[2:33:13] saying. The situation is very bad." I'm
[2:33:15] just paraphrasing so we can go. But to
[2:33:18] go to the king, you know, I cannot do
[2:33:21] that. If I go, they will kill me.
[2:33:24] Modecia look, he
[2:33:27] say he broke a seal. Watch what is
[2:33:31] breaking. Yes, sir. Are you there? Are
[2:33:33] we there? Verse 13. Then Modi commanded,
[2:33:38] not spoke.
[2:33:41] Commanded to Esther. It's a command.
[2:33:47] He say think not
[2:33:50] with yourself that you shall escape when
[2:33:53] in the king's house more than who? All
[2:33:55] the Jews. For if you all together has
[2:33:58] held your peace when all this time, then
[2:34:01] shall their enlodment or deliverance or
[2:34:05] relief enlargement and deliverance arise
[2:34:08] where to the Jews from where another
[2:34:10] place but you in other word Esther if
[2:34:14] you don't want to open your mouth
[2:34:17] if you don't want to make a move
[2:34:20] no one thing
[2:34:23] deliverance will come from somewhere.
[2:34:26] Glory to God. But remember, God doesn't
[2:34:28] change his mind. If God already say it's
[2:34:32] Charles, God cannot use plan B.
[2:34:40] That's right.
[2:34:42] He says, "Elloment and deliverance arise
[2:34:45] to the Jews from what?" Another place,
[2:34:47] but you and your father house shall be
[2:34:49] what? Destroyed. Watch now. He's
[2:34:51] breaking something. And who knows?
[2:34:54] That's all right. Whether you are come
[2:34:59] to the kingdom for such a time as what?
[2:35:03] In other word, if you don't understand
[2:35:07] the very purpose
[2:35:09] [Applause]
[2:35:12] you were put there is for this time.

[2:35:27] Brother Kelly, I'm going to rock the
[2:35:29] devil.
[2:35:30] I'm going to rock him really hard.
[2:35:33] Why were you not in in Ephesus?
[2:35:40] Why were you not born in Luther age?
[2:35:43] Why were you not born in Col?
[2:35:47] God positionally
[2:35:50] bless you to see the pope.
[2:35:55] [Applause]
[2:36:04] You were put in this time for a purpose.
[2:36:09] When the pope is rising up, you also are
[2:36:12] rising up.
[2:36:17] [Applause]
[2:36:20] Do you think you're existing now for
[2:36:22] nothing? Your purpose is bigger than you
[2:36:24] think.
[2:36:28] You are not here just to buy a house.
[2:36:31] You are not here just for a car. You are
[2:36:34] here to manifest God.
[2:36:43] Who knows? Who knows if you were put in
[2:36:47] the kingdom for such a time as this? In
[2:36:51] other words, instead of being disturbed
[2:36:55] and begin to be afraid,
[2:36:57] Esther, look where you sitting. You are
[2:37:00] the queen, there is a purpose.
[2:37:06] [Applause]
[2:37:16] I have a question. I have a question. If
[2:37:19] you got a mission,
[2:37:21] okay, and the mission is very very
[2:37:24] dangerous, who do you send,
[2:37:28] you send the Navy Seal,
[2:37:31] you send the elite
[2:37:33] because the mission is very bad and this
[2:37:36] age is the worst of all. And God pick
[2:37:40] you and send you. So who are you?
[2:37:45] Who are you?
[2:37:53] You crying for a headache.
[2:37:55] No you are created before headache.

[2:38:03] time to manifest God.

[2:38:18] In my throne.
[2:38:22] Are we together? Where am I at my
[2:38:25] friend? He says in other words, who
[2:38:29] knows Esther the very purpose you were
[2:38:33] placed here was to counteract Hmon. In
[2:38:37] other words, God saw Hmon
[2:38:40] [Music]
[2:38:41] and God positioned you first.
[2:38:46] So you have more power than Hmon.
[2:38:49] [Applause]
[2:38:52] Are we together? Job to verse uh uh 15.
[2:38:58] Then Esther did them return Morcai to
[2:39:02] this answer. Yes. Go ahead my friend. Go
[2:39:06] gather together all the Jews that are
[2:39:09] present in Shushanhu and fast ye for me.
[2:39:13] When the when the position the purpose
[2:39:15] is revealed, the prayer is open.
[2:39:20] Now Esther is praying with revelation.
[2:39:22] Amen. She's not just praying. She's
[2:39:26] praying in her position.
[2:39:28] She's praying in the will of God. She's
[2:39:31] praying in the line of duty. Amen.
[2:39:35] The Bible says that go gather together
[2:39:38] all the Jews that are present in Shushan
[2:39:40] and fast you for me and neither eat nor
[2:39:43] drink three days uh night or day. I also
[2:39:46] and my maiden will fast likewise and so
[2:39:49] will I go to the water the king which is
[2:39:52] not according to the water. If I perish
[2:39:56] I perish.

[2:40:03] [Applause]
[2:40:05] Because God because Modi sent a command.
[2:40:14] Let me say this. The message of Modcai
[2:40:17] has two part.
[2:40:21] Yes sir. The message of Modi one is to
[2:40:24] unveil Hmon.
[2:40:27] And after unveiling Amen the second part
[2:40:30] is to unveil Esther.

[2:41:26] Amen. At the beginning, she taught her
[2:41:30] husband can kill her.

[2:42:03] law.

[2:42:14] extended.
[2:42:19] Now say, so he loved me above his law.
[2:42:24] So he can compromise his law to keep me
[2:42:27] alive.

[2:52:26] it is not William Brham. It is the devil
[2:52:29] need to know God and me.

[2:52:51] Brandham is coming the message is coming
[2:52:55] today. The message is in the bread.
[2:52:58] The bride is the word.

[2:53:44] Esther has what? Prepared. And the king
[2:53:47] said to Esther at the banquet of wine, I
[2:53:50] won't touch this banquet. We already
[2:53:51] touch it. The second one is where we
[2:53:53] stop. We never touch at the bank. This
[2:53:56] this is the first banquet. At the
[2:53:58] banquet of one, one is your petition and

[2:55:57] God can't stand those types. He says,
[2:56:00] "If it pleases the king to grant my
[2:56:02] petition and to perform my request, let
[2:56:04] the king and Amen came to the banquet
[2:56:08] that sh I shall prepare for them what
[2:56:11] and and I will do tomorrow." You already
[2:56:13] have a plan to prepare. Who told you the
[2:56:16] king is available?
[2:56:20] [Laughter]
[2:56:21] I hope now you are learning how to pray

[2:57:17] me now. You are you are puzzling me. I
[2:57:20] don't know what you want. You say if I
[2:57:22] want just tell me what you want.
[2:57:26] A good way to disturb a man.
[2:57:29] [Applause]
[2:57:32] Do you want me? Do you want do you want
[2:57:34] a new car? If you will,
[2:57:40] you will have that car. You will have
[2:57:42] that because his pastor he was
[2:57:44] expecting. Yes. You say if you will, if
[2:57:48] there is no payment, if if you don't
[2:57:49] have money, don't even worry, honey.
[2:57:51] Just leave it alone. I'm good with the
[2:57:53] car I have.
[2:57:59] [Music]
[2:58:01] I must give her that car.
[2:58:04] I'm teaching you even marriage. Not I
[2:58:07] want that car. No, no, no, no, no.
[2:58:09] Honey, I'm good.
[2:58:13] We are not in married couple. Let's go
[2:58:15] here. Where are we at? Verse one. He say
[2:58:18] on the second day at the banquet of one,
[2:58:21] what is that word that petition queen
[2:58:22] Esther and it shall be granted to you?
[2:58:24] And what is your request? And it shall
[2:58:26] be performed again even to the what half
[2:58:29] of the kingdom. Then Esther the queen
[2:58:32] answered and say, if I have found what
[2:58:36] favor in your sight, oh king, and if he
[2:58:39] please,
[2:58:42] let my life
[2:58:44] be given me at what? My petition and my
[2:58:48] people at what? My request. For the
[2:58:51] first time, the identification is
[2:58:54] infold.
[2:58:56] I'm a Jew. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:59:02] [Applause]
[2:59:04] Esther, open up her identity. I'm a Jew.
[2:59:09] Let's see when the identity is open.
[2:59:12] What does he do to amen?
[2:59:15] The second coming is hidden here but I
[2:59:18] can't touch it. He says my friend he
[2:59:21] says for we are sold I and my people to
[2:59:25] be destroyed. Ah so those Jews that they
[2:59:28] want to kill you also are there and to
[2:59:32] be slain to be slain and to perish. But
[2:59:35] if we have been sold for born men and
[2:59:37] born women, I had my tongue. Although
[2:59:40] the enemy could not contravail the
[2:59:42] king's damage. In other words, damage to
[2:59:45] the king.
[2:59:47] Then the king has a censored and say to
[2:59:50] Esther the queen, who is he?
[2:59:54] When your identity is unveiled, he get
[2:59:57] the king upset. Yes, he does. Who is he?
[3:00:00] And where is he? Not just who, but where
[3:00:03] is he? That's right.
[3:00:06] That day
[3:00:09] presume brother Brandham say adventuring
[3:00:12] without authority
[3:00:15] presume in his heart to do so. And
[3:00:19] Esther say the
[3:00:22] adversary
[3:00:23] Satana and the enemy is this wicked who?
[3:00:28] Amen. in the face.
[3:00:32] Then Hmon was how afraid before who? The
[3:00:37] king. And the queen.
[3:00:40] When you are done, it is revealed.
[3:00:48] Now it is no longer Christ. It is no
[3:00:52] longer Jesus. It is Jesus and Paul.
[3:01:02] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[3:01:05] together? Amen. Go to chapter eight.
[3:01:10] Hallelujah. Go to chapter eight, my
[3:01:13] friend.
[3:01:14] Go to verse three. I'm skipping. And
[3:01:17] Esther spoke yet
[3:01:19] again before the king and fell down at
[3:01:22] his
[3:01:23] feet and besought him with tears. This
[3:01:27] is where I'm going to get to Christ to
[3:01:29] put away the mischief of Hmon the Aagar
[3:01:33] and the device that he had devised
[3:01:35] against the Jews. Then the king held out
[3:01:37] the golden scepter toward Esther. So
[3:01:40] Esther arose and stood before the king
[3:01:42] and said, "If he please the king, and if
[3:01:46] I have found favor in his sight, and the
[3:01:50] thing seems right
[3:01:52] before the king, not before me, and I be
[3:01:57] pleasing
[3:01:59] in his eyes, Esther,
[3:02:01] I thought you were pleased above all the
[3:02:05] women, and I be pleased in his sight.
[3:02:08] Let it be written another. So every
[3:02:11] request Esther is coming with he always
[3:02:13] give both side
[3:02:15] but she pushes the request. Let it be
[3:02:18] written to reverse the letter devised by
[3:02:20] Hmon the son of Hamad the Aakite which
[3:02:24] he wrote to destroy the Jews with in the
[3:02:26] king's province. Amen. Verse seven. Then
[3:02:29] the king of Hazarus said to Esther the
[3:02:31] queen and to Morca the Jew, "Behold, I
[3:02:34] have given
[3:02:35] Esther the house of Amen."
[3:02:42] The house of Amen is given to Esther.
[3:02:47] House of hell sir.
[3:02:50] Give way.
[3:02:51] [Applause]
[3:02:54] The whole house of him. Hell you have a
[3:02:58] you you are controlling it.
[3:03:00] I have given him and him that and him
[3:03:04] they have hang upon the gallow because
[3:03:06] he laid his hand upon the Jew. Write to
[3:03:09] you also. Who's going to write? Esther.
[3:03:13] Esther for the Jew as he likes you the
[3:03:17] way you want. In the king's name. Oh,
[3:03:23] who's writing? Esther. Under which name?
[3:03:26] The king's name. You are coming under
[3:03:29] which name? The king's name. If you come
[3:03:32] in my name,
[3:03:35] you are coming in that name. In the
[3:03:38] king's name, and seal it
[3:03:42] with the what? King's ring. For the
[3:03:44] running which is written in the king's
[3:03:47] name and seal with the king's ring, may
[3:03:51] no man do what? Reverse. So you got the
[3:03:54] king seal.
[3:03:58] And you are riding in the name of the
[3:04:00] king. So who are you?
[3:04:06] Are we together? Verse 17. And in every
[3:04:10] province and in every city, wherever the
[3:04:13] king's commandment and decree came that
[3:04:16] Esther wrote, the Jews had joy and what?
[3:04:21] And what? A feast. And a what? And a
[3:04:23] good day. And many of the people of the
[3:04:26] land became Jews. So he got convert.
[3:04:31] Somebody gave his life to the Lord.
[3:04:35] The pressure of Amen begin to bring
[3:04:37] souls.
[3:04:39] You remember Lazarus begin to bring
[3:04:41] souls. There was a purpose. And then
[3:04:43] many became Jews for the fear of the
[3:04:45] Jews did what? And we finishing here
[3:04:48] chapter 9 verse 12. Let's finish here.
[3:04:53] And the king said to Esther the queen,
[3:04:55] "The Jew have slain the destroy uh uh
[3:04:58] slain and destroy 500 men in Sushan the
[3:05:01] palace and 10 son of Hmon. What have
[3:05:03] they done in the rest of the king's
[3:05:06] province?" Now what is your petition?
[3:05:09] You can never exhaust God. He want to
[3:05:14] be continue to bother him. You remember
[3:05:17] the quote? Amen. Now it's the king keep
[3:05:20] bothering yesterday. You don't ask. You
[3:05:22] don't ask. You asking leader what else?
[3:05:25] Keep asking. Amen. Amen. What have they
[3:05:29] done to the rest of the king's province?
[3:05:31] Now, what is your petition and it shall
[3:05:33] be granted to you? Or what is your
[3:05:35] request further? Amen. And it shall be
[3:05:39] done. Then Esther say again if he
[3:05:42] pleased the king let it be granted to
[3:05:45] the Jews which are in Shushan to do
[3:05:47] tomorrow also according to this day's
[3:05:50] degree and let Hmon's sons be hang upon
[3:05:53] the gallow every request of Esther never
[3:05:57] change
[3:05:59] I want to match your will I want to
[3:06:02] please you want to your desire
[3:06:08] but if it doesn't work, I'm still there.
[3:06:11] If it doesn't work, I'm still your
[3:06:13] queen. If you didn't give it to me, you
[3:06:15] won't change anything. I'm still yours.
[3:06:18] I still belong to you. Amen. But one
[3:06:22] thing that it is, every request she
[3:06:25] asked was answered because God answer
[3:06:29] every prayer.
[3:06:31] Don't be scared of the devil. Remember
[3:06:34] who you are. Remember your identity.
[3:06:37] Remember, you were created before the
[3:06:40] devil.
[3:06:42] Amen. Amen. Let's stop here.
[3:06:46] God bless you. Let's stand.
[3:06:50] [Applause]
[3:06:59] We will pick up next Sunday on Christ.

[3:07:06] Sometime your will some of your prayer
[3:07:09] man match his will some not. Sometime
[3:07:11] you are completely off. God send the
[3:07:14] spirit to help
[3:07:16] us to help us in our infirmities in our

[3:07:30] you. And sometime you are trouble
[3:07:33] because it seems like things are not
[3:07:35] rolling the way you want to be roll. It
[3:07:37] doesn't mean God have not heard your
[3:07:39] prayer. It's a matter of time. It's a
