[1:32:47] brother brandom say it seems to be a
[1:32:50] beautiful
[1:32:51] outline I like David do you know the
[1:32:55] what the Psalms the psalm are not only
[1:32:59] songs but they are what prophecy did you
[1:33:03] know
[1:33:04] that so what we reading here is a
[1:33:07] prophecy
[1:33:09] amen a prophecy that
[1:33:12] God Amen is saying that
[1:33:19] ye we are gods
[1:33:24] I say that God said it clearly God said
[1:33:28] it verse six I have
[1:33:32] said in the
[1:33:34] past I have
[1:33:37] saided so somewhere God
[1:33:40] spoke I have said in the past that ye
[1:33:44] are what God and all of
[1:33:49] you no
[1:33:52] exception am there's no male and female
[1:33:55] here all of you are what children of the
[1:33:59] most high so children of God are what
[1:34:02] children of the most high Children of
[1:34:05] the most high God they are Gods amen so
[1:34:09] God have his
[1:34:11] children and when God look at the
[1:34:14] children his children he look at he say
[1:34:18] here are Gods why does God have to talk
[1:34:21] to his children about their
[1:34:24] identity on now
[1:34:26] brother amen who here have called his
[1:34:30] son and say you are
[1:34:36] human who say that oh you call your
[1:34:39] daughter you say you are a
[1:34:42] girl but God is looking at his children
[1:34:45] he say Hey Ye are God it means that
[1:34:49] those children have a problem
[1:34:54] are we together his children have a
[1:35:01] measure are we together are we together
[1:35:05] is my Bible different than your bible
[1:35:09] let me let me help you where it's coming
[1:35:11] from jum to verse seven verse seven but
[1:35:15] you shall die like what Ah that's the
[1:35:19] problem amen how can a God die God
[1:35:23] didn't say you will die like
[1:35:29] God because God himself
[1:35:33] died in the man Jesus
[1:35:37] Christ is it too
[1:35:40] strong Jesus was God two weeks ago the
[1:35:44] Bible said Jesus was the true God but
[1:35:47] Jesus was crucified they didn't kill God
[1:35:51] they killed the man Jesus Christ and God
[1:35:55] is saying here that you will die like
[1:35:57] men amen and fall like one of the what
[1:36:03] princes but even though death affect us
[1:36:06] on but God is coming back here on verse
[1:36:09] six he say you are my
[1:36:12] children and you are not just the
[1:36:14] children of somebody you are the
[1:36:16] children of the most
[1:36:18] high and I want you to know that ye are
[1:36:21] Gods so there is something having a
[1:36:24] problem with God
[1:36:27] children understanding their rightly
[1:36:31] position all the rightly given
[1:36:35] identity God children have a tendency to
[1:36:39] have
[1:36:42] amnesia that's why God said and he sent
[1:36:46] the word that ye are God even though you
[1:36:49] dying like men
[1:36:53] amen even though you get
[1:36:58] sick even though you get a
[1:37:01] headache remember you are God brother
[1:37:05] Bram say Jesus had
[1:37:07] headache the Bible say Jesus was tempted
[1:37:10] in every form but the temptation of
[1:37:13] Jesus Christ and the pain and the
[1:37:16] suffering of Jesus Christ never remove
[1:37:19] in him the fact that he was God
[1:37:24] Jesus had a time that he had to
[1:37:28] cry can you say amen he cry at the tomb
[1:37:32] of
[1:37:33] Lazarus but after a while Jesus stood up
[1:37:36] and said remove the stone Lazarus come
[1:37:40] for the crying of Jesus Christ didn't
[1:37:44] block him to express his
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:49] godship so there was a time he
[1:37:51] cried but that c crying never gave him a
[1:37:55] doubt that you know what you cry so much
[1:37:58] maybe you're not God no he cry as a man
[1:38:02] but after a while he shook himself
[1:38:05] up he said I got a vision that this man
[1:38:09] must Rise Again take the stone away he's
[1:38:14] thinking that's not my problem open this
[1:38:17] door Lazarus with your band come forth
[1:38:21] and he come forth with his band coming
[1:38:23] out of the
[1:38:28] Grave are we together are we together
[1:38:31] our godship was completely expressed in
[1:38:34] Jesus Christ showing you that you can
[1:38:36] live a life of trouble a life of pain a
[1:38:40] life of difficulty but remember you are
[1:38:44] God remember you are the children of the
[1:38:47] most high remember even if you have a
[1:38:50] headache or you have a sness issue you
[1:38:52] are God
[1:38:54] all you waiting is a little spark of
[1:38:57] Faith from God to hander that
[1:39:04] trouble are we together are we
[1:39:10] together we were dealing with the five
[1:39:14] garment and we landed on Moses and we
[1:39:17] were showing the fa garment in the life
[1:39:19] of Moses and when we were showing that
[1:39:22] we Str back a deep Revelation where God
[1:39:26] told Moses that hey
[1:39:28] Moses I want you to know
[1:39:31] me different than Abraham that's right
[1:39:35] different than Isaac you know that
[1:39:38] different than Jacob I'm going to reveal
[1:39:40] myself to you as
[1:39:43] Jehovah and the way the Theologian
[1:39:46] everybody got Jehovah is a man with his
[1:39:49] family uh-uh it took a prophet that's
[1:39:51] right to come back and say that's not
[1:39:53] really the concept of Jehovah Jehovah
[1:39:56] means god is creating a mature
[1:40:01] God we went through that before amen
[1:40:05] amen and he told Moses he said now you
[1:40:08] Moses the way you are when you go to
[1:40:12] Pharaoh you going to be
[1:40:15] God to Pharaoh Moses say hey this is too
[1:40:20] strong how is he going to believe me
[1:40:23] amen amen and God started this with
[1:40:26] Moses that's right that's why when Jesus
[1:40:29] was on the road to EMAs with the
[1:40:31] disciple the Bible say he begin to talk
[1:40:34] to them about him Beginning by
[1:40:41] Moses
[1:40:46] Moses Moses was the one that said the
[1:40:49] Lord your God will send you a prophet
[1:40:53] like me
[1:40:59] Moses are we together are we together
[1:41:03] are we together let's go to the book of
[1:41:12] act glory to
[1:41:15] God let's go to the book of
[1:41:20] act we have to recalibrate
[1:41:24] clear our
[1:41:27] brain because as long as you don't
[1:41:29] receive this truth yet it's hard for the
[1:41:32] truth to be
[1:41:33] manifested so we got to reprogram
[1:41:36] everything teach everything until you
[1:41:40] receive the teaching and the god flows
[1:41:43] into the software of the stre of the
[1:41:49] teaching amen amen amen amen we have
[1:41:52] been giv C we don't know how to
[1:41:59] drive amen amen amen I had a car when I
[1:42:04] went to to buy the car they told me you
[1:42:06] need to come here one or two hour to sit
[1:42:09] down so they can teach you how to drive
[1:42:11] that
[1:42:13] car amen and if you skip
[1:42:17] that you can still drive the
[1:42:20] car but there will be a lot of potential
[1:42:23] of that car that you don't know you may
[1:42:26] be stucking in the hill you don't know
[1:42:29] that there is a program in that car that
[1:42:31] take care of the Hill because you miss
[1:42:34] the
[1:42:36] training how many people have a cell
[1:42:38] phone here do you know everything that
[1:42:40] is loaded on your cell phone so you are
[1:42:42] operating based on the knowledge that
[1:42:45] you know but there is a lot of things
[1:42:47] you can do with your cell phone we only
[1:42:49] know the basics the picture the calling
[1:42:52] the texting but there are many things
[1:42:54] that you can do with your
[1:42:57] software how will you know if somebody
[1:42:59] don't train
[1:43:01] you are we okay let's go to act 14:8 if
[1:43:06] you thereare you can say Amen we talk
[1:43:08] about this with the faith of the
[1:43:10] Gentile the Bible say the same uh verse
[1:43:14] eight and there sat who a certain man
[1:43:18] aistra at the Gentile country who was
[1:43:20] what importent in his feet import weaken
[1:43:23] his feet being a from his
[1:43:27] mother's womb who never
[1:43:30] walk we clear this is not among Jewish
[1:43:34] people this is
[1:43:36] aistra somewhere in Greece or something
[1:43:39] amen amen and the same heard Paul speak
[1:43:44] who steadfastly Paul was preaching
[1:43:47] beholding him Paul looking at him and
[1:43:50] perceiving that he had Faith to be he
[1:43:53] Paul saw
[1:43:55] that and Paul say said with a loud voice
[1:43:59] stand up stand upright on your feet and
[1:44:04] he leaped and walk did Paul touch him no
[1:44:09] did Paul pray for him no did Paul cast
[1:44:12] out the
[1:44:16] devil who made that boy creeper was it
[1:44:19] uh God or a devil
[1:44:26] so how did that devil
[1:44:30] go normally we say in the name of Jesus
[1:44:33] Christ rise up Paul didn't say in the
[1:44:35] name of Jesus Christ Paul say Hey You
[1:44:39] There stand
[1:44:41] up under which
[1:44:44] authority and it
[1:44:47] happened amen am verse uh uh 11 and when
[1:44:53] when the people
[1:44:55] saw what Paul had done they lift up
[1:44:59] their voices saying in the speech of the
[1:45:03] laan the
[1:45:07] gods are come down to us in the likeness
[1:45:12] of
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:19] what he look like the gentile people
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:27] understand it look like Gentile were G
[1:45:32] somehow to easily
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:36] accept God in human
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:44] flesh amen the god in the likeness in
[1:45:49] the likeness of means in the form yes
[1:45:53] that's right of a human being so when a
[1:45:56] gentile sees a miracle directly he turn
[1:46:00] he say this man is a
[1:46:05] god am but they lack the revelation of
[1:46:10] worship verse 12 and they call
[1:46:14] Barnabas Jupiter and Paul mercurious
[1:46:18] because he was a he was the chief
[1:46:20] speaker then the priest of Jupiter
[1:46:23] which was before their City brought what
[1:46:25] o and what and Garland garlanded to the
[1:46:28] gate and would have done what sacrifice
[1:46:31] with the people they even ready to
[1:46:33] worship which when the Apostle Barnabas
[1:46:37] and Paul heard of it they did what they
[1:46:39] rent their clothes and run in amongst
[1:46:42] the people crying out saying what s why
[1:46:45] do you do these things we are also what
[1:46:47] men of like passions with you like
[1:46:50] passion with you and preach to you that
[1:46:52] you should turn from the from the this
[1:46:55] vanity to the what Living God which made
[1:46:58] Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all
[1:46:59] things that are what there when it comes
[1:47:02] to worship the disciple push the break
[1:47:04] they say
[1:47:06] no amen amen not about worship worship
[1:47:12] is only one man only the Lord Jesus
[1:47:16] Christ when it come to worship it's only
[1:47:19] the big fellow the almighty God Amen but
[1:47:23] when they look at they say these are
[1:47:27] Gods what I want to draw there is among
[1:47:31] the Gentile it seems to be
[1:47:34] easy to accept the idea that God can be
[1:47:38] a human
[1:47:40] being am amen let's go to act
[1:47:45] 28 glory to
[1:47:49] God
[1:47:50] hallelujah if you there you can say
[1:47:53] Amen act 28
[1:47:57] verse1 you there very familiar story and
[1:48:01] when they were
[1:48:02] escaped then they knew that the island
[1:48:05] was called what Mita and the barbarous
[1:48:09] people show us no lead kindness in other
[1:48:11] words they were very kind for they
[1:48:14] kindled a fire and re as everyone
[1:48:18] because of the present rain and because
[1:48:21] of the cold
[1:48:23] and when Paul has gathered a bundle of
[1:48:26] sticks and laid them on the fire they
[1:48:29] came up what viper out of the heat
[1:48:31] brother Bram say he was a m out of the
[1:48:34] Heat and fasted on his hand and when the
[1:48:38] bararan saw the venomous Beast hang on
[1:48:42] his hand they said among themselves no
[1:48:45] doubt this man is what a
[1:48:49] murderer because something wrong
[1:48:51] happened to him because he can die like
[1:48:54] a man they call him a
[1:48:58] murderer for a season of
[1:49:00] time amen amen whom though he has
[1:49:04] escaped the sea yet Vengeance Justice
[1:49:08] orow allow not to leave and Paul Paul he
[1:49:13] shook off the Beast you see it's called
[1:49:15] a
[1:49:18] beast never play with brother Bram when
[1:49:21] he say something when brother Bram say
[1:49:24] something he's always
[1:49:27] right brother Bram the prophet he's
[1:49:30] always
[1:49:33] right not the man the
[1:49:35] prophet that prophet in revelation 22 is
[1:49:39] always right amen amen amen amen and
[1:49:43] when he shook off the Beast Into the
[1:49:45] Fire and fell what no har however they
[1:49:48] look when he should have what swollen
[1:49:51] they know what comes up after this Beast
[1:49:53] hit you or what or fallen down dead
[1:49:56] suddenly but after they look for a great
[1:50:00] one somebody's watching they say this is
[1:50:03] going to sink him this trial is going to
[1:50:06] sink
[1:50:07] her with whatever she got now she can
[1:50:11] survive this
[1:50:13] trial she's going through such a hard
[1:50:16] time we seen her crying crying all night
[1:50:21] we seen her we
[1:50:23] we seen her devastating it looks like
[1:50:26] she's going to lose her mind she doesn't
[1:50:29] even know how to Bon her
[1:50:31] shirt because of too much depression
[1:50:35] after they wait for a
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:41] while amen amen they look for a great
[1:50:45] one and so what no harm come to him they
[1:50:49] changed their
[1:50:51] minds and said say that he was a
[1:50:57] God so wherever you take this among the
[1:51:01] Gentile they don't have a
[1:51:05] problem understanding that God can be a
[1:51:07] human
[1:51:09] being are we together the Gentile have
[1:51:12] no problem at
[1:51:14] all brother Bram says this let me go by
[1:51:18] Daniel first in the Book of Daniel chap
[1:51:21] 2:46
[1:51:23] the Bible says then the King
[1:51:25] Nebuchadnezzar did what fell upon his
[1:51:28] face and did what and worshiped
[1:51:33] Daniel can you verify in your Bible when
[1:51:38] Daniel interpreted the dream the king
[1:51:42] fell down and begin to worship a human
[1:51:45] being amen amen amen yes my brother I
[1:51:49] know where you are you are at the age so
[1:51:52] so we're going to worship one another
[1:51:54] that's where you
[1:51:57] are and worship Daniel and commanded
[1:52:00] that they should offer what an oblation
[1:52:03] and what and sweet odors unto him the
[1:52:05] king answered unto Daniel and said offer
[1:52:08] truth it is that your God is the god of
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:19] God and the Lord of Kings and a revealer
[1:52:23] of what secret seeing that could reveal
[1:52:26] what this
[1:52:28] secret he asked everybody nobody was
[1:52:31] able he said listen I won't even give
[1:52:33] you the dream you tell me the dream and
[1:52:36] you give the interpretation and when
[1:52:38] Daniel did it they
[1:52:41] say this is God in human flesh please
[1:52:45] bring me the stuff to worship this man
[1:52:47] and he even made an
[1:52:50] image Hallelujah
[1:52:53] unto
[1:52:55] Daniel
[1:52:57] elist gods in
[1:52:59] Melita gods in Babylon
[1:53:04] gods are we together in act chapter 10
[1:53:09] verse 25 we find that and as Peter was
[1:53:14] coming who cornelus met met him and did
[1:53:18] what and fell down at his feet and did
[1:53:21] what and worshiped him
[1:53:25] when they told a gentile by an Angel
[1:53:29] that we're going to send Peter say pet
[1:53:31] an angel is talking about Peter so this
[1:53:33] Peter must be somebody when he saw Peter
[1:53:37] he fell down and begin to workship
[1:53:38] because Peter has been testified by an
[1:53:46] Angel but Peter did what took him up
[1:53:50] saying what stand up I'm myself also I
[1:53:53] am a what so there is a duality right
[1:53:56] there it's Men Behaving like Gods until
[1:54:01] they put people in
[1:54:08] confusion are we together amen now
[1:54:10] people have a difficulty is this God or
[1:54:13] not
[1:54:18] God Amen am amen amen amen amen
[1:54:23] we found out couple weeks ago that
[1:54:26] brother Bram said God is alone in
[1:54:30] creation he said the devil can create if
[1:54:34] you say the devil can heal then you make
[1:54:36] him what a Creator then he's what he's
[1:54:39] co-equal with God so we know that the
[1:54:41] devil is not co-equal with god with God
[1:54:44] Only God Alone can do what create the
[1:54:47] devil can only do what pervert what's
[1:54:50] already created amen and then brother
[1:54:52] Bram say you believe God is here amen
[1:54:56] you believe God is in his
[1:54:58] creation God is in his word uh-huh God
[1:55:02] is in his son amen now God where in his
[1:55:06] people everything that God was he was
[1:55:09] put it in where into Jesus Christ he was
[1:55:11] what he was co-equal with the father is
[1:55:14] that right think if not what robbery to
[1:55:17] be what equal with the father that's why
[1:55:20] Jesus say I and my father we are what
[1:55:23] are one we clear amen we clear amen we
[1:55:26] clear amen okay praise God then we saw
[1:55:29] in asaiah that the devil wanted to
[1:55:33] rise above the children of God above the
[1:55:37] mighty fellows he say I will Ascend
[1:55:41] above the heights of the cloud and I
[1:55:43] will be like the most high and he was
[1:55:46] strong down and the position he was
[1:55:48] looking for was given to the Church of
[1:55:51] laod
[1:55:54] this position was never given to
[1:56:01] Ephesus we got Ephesus we got smina we
[1:56:05] got pergamus we got tarian we got Sardis
[1:56:11] we got Philadelphia and we got
[1:56:14] laoda all along here God never promis
[1:56:18] anybody else
[1:56:20] strong amen remember before Ephesus
[1:56:24] started follow me carefully Jesus was at
[1:56:28] the cross and when he was at the cross
[1:56:31] he died and they piered him on the
[1:56:35] side are we together and water and blood
[1:56:39] came out which was talking about a
[1:56:43] birth you know this correctly after the
[1:56:46] bre amen and the spirit that came out of
[1:56:50] Jesus Christ came back on the the
[1:56:52] Ephesus Church that's right but even
[1:56:54] though that Spirit came down here nobody
[1:56:57] was promised the
[1:57:00] throne no one here no one there no one
[1:57:04] there but the last
[1:57:06] stage which is sealing the Gentile age
[1:57:11] is promised to sit with God upon the
[1:57:15] throne what Lucifer was longing for
[1:57:19] somebody's giv that position
[1:57:23] why why do we get that
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:27] position we together we together amen
[1:57:31] let's keep claming my friend in the
[1:57:33] message God doesn't call men to judgment
[1:57:35] without first warning him brother Bram
[1:57:38] say I thought after having the healing
[1:57:41] service last Sunday then maybe this
[1:57:44] Sunday if we just take the what the
[1:57:47] teaching the teaching and do what and

[1:58:55] thought it is a deep
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:58:59] one are we together and what is these
[1:59:02] three Pro purpose brother Bram say
[1:59:05] notice in Christ is the mystery of God R
[1:59:09] God has had a what a threefold purpose
[1:59:12] in this great what mystery secret
[1:59:15] brother Bram called this a
[1:59:18] mystery a mystery Secret
[1:59:22] don't worry my friend keep your seat
[1:59:24] belt a mystery secret amen God in his
[1:59:29] great mystery secet that he had when
[1:59:32] before the world began he has got what a
[1:59:35] three-fold purpose in it now what we
[1:59:38] want to go upon this morning what is
[1:59:41] that three-fold purpose see now I
[1:59:45] Believe by the help of God who is
[1:59:47] present and he shall show it to us now
[1:59:50] if he has this third this three-fold
[1:59:54] purpose we we want to find out what is
[1:59:57] this three-fold purpose the first things
[2:00:00] was that God wanted to reveal himself to
[2:00:04] what the people follow me
[2:00:08] carefully brother Bram continue secondly
[2:00:12] to have what the preeminence in his body
[2:00:15] of what believer that is what his bride
[2:00:17] that he might leave what in people
[2:00:20] that's right now how could do how could
[2:00:24] do H sorry he could do that in what in
[2:00:27] Adam and Eve but what but sin separated
[2:00:30] them in other word when God created man
[2:00:33] in the Garden of Eden he wanted to
[2:00:36] accomplish something with Adam and Eve
[2:00:40] but sin interrupted the program and man
[2:00:44] never leave for a thousand year that's
[2:00:47] right amen I'm going slowly now brother
[2:00:50] Bram say so now now they had to be some
[2:00:53] way to do what to get it back again in
[2:00:57] other word whatever God started with
[2:01:00] Adam and Eve
[2:01:03] amen never reached its
[2:01:08] maturity God had a plan and he he
[2:01:12] created Adam and he created Eve and put
[2:01:16] them to express that plan but for some
[2:01:19] reason that plan was never expressed
[2:01:22] amen amen the plan was interrupted by
[2:01:26] sin and because it was interrupted by
[2:01:30] sin God had a plan
[2:01:35] B are you following me are you following
[2:01:39] me I'm going slowly God had a plan B
[2:01:42] this plan is Plan B God knew that the
[2:01:47] devil will block him from doing exactly
[2:01:51] what he wanted to do so therefore God
[2:01:54] put a backup
[2:01:56] plan that whatever the devil will
[2:01:58] destroy here he can restore it
[2:02:04] back let's continue to clam my friend
[2:02:07] brother Bram says oh
[2:02:10] my this is what Rich oh what is rich
[2:02:15] brother Bram it is riched to me just to
[2:02:18] even what think of it think about what
[2:02:21] about going back again to Adam and
[2:02:27] Eve in the age of laia right here what
[2:02:31] happened at the end of
[2:02:33] laisha The
[2:02:36] Rapture amen after the Rapture what
[2:02:39] follow three and a half year of
[2:02:42] tribulation amen then everything is
[2:02:45] destroyed then what follow

[2:02:51] and a half half years we are in heaven

[2:02:58] then we have to come back to start
[2:03:02] what the
[2:03:04] Millennium everybody okay Armageddon
[2:03:06] through the millennium are we together
[2:03:09] then brother Bram say see what God's
[2:03:11] purpose was now why didn't he just keep
[2:03:15] Adam and Eve like that why did God allow
[2:03:18] Adam and Eve to
[2:03:20] fall then he he will never be able to
[2:03:23] express his what his fullness his what
[2:03:26] his full attribute So Adam must give
[2:03:29] must open the gate so that somebody
[2:03:33] inia can repeat
[2:03:37] again what Adam and Eve I'm going slowly
[2:03:42] my friend glory to God brother Bram
[2:03:46] continue he said first he wanted to
[2:03:49] express himself how completely where God
[2:03:52] in Christ so the first plan of God is
[2:03:55] that God wanted to become
[2:03:59] [Applause]
[2:04:02] flesh I'm going slowly God wanted to
[2:04:06] become
[2:04:07] human not in
[2:04:10] portion
[2:04:12] completely
[2:04:14] kosis in other word
[2:04:16] god putting himself into Christ amen
[2:04:24] until the father and the son are

[2:04:32] me help you up again the son is the body
[2:04:38] part amen and the one that was inside
[2:04:43] amen this is God so the
[2:04:48] god
[2:04:50] Kos pour himself into the son so the
[2:04:55] first plan of God was when men fail God
[2:04:59] said don't worry devil I know what I'm
[2:05:02] going to do since my plan is working
[2:05:05] according to the way I knew you going to
[2:05:07] work I have a backup plan number one I'm
[2:05:12] not going to remain
[2:05:17] God me God I'm going to become human
[2:05:24] are we together so the first plan was
[2:05:27] God becoming human and he did it in the
[2:05:30] Man Called Jesus
[2:05:32] Christ are we together amen God
[2:05:34] fulfilled it and Jesus was God everybody
[2:05:38] can clap hand to
[2:05:41] that congratulation God praise God
[2:05:46] congratulation we love that revelation
[2:05:49] we appreciate it God become human in
[2:05:53] other word when you touch Jesus you
[2:05:56] touching
[2:05:59] her when you see Jesus you see who
[2:06:03] God but when you give that God bread he
[2:06:10] eats and sometime that God get
[2:06:13] tired sometime as they walking maybe B
[2:06:17] can push him and they see God doing this
[2:06:20] B me stop those
[2:06:24] joke but the fullness come on come on
[2:06:27] come on come on of the godhead was in
[2:06:31] him maybe you don't get me in other word
[2:06:35] when Jesus was here heaven was
[2:06:50] empty when Jes J was here when you go to
[2:06:53] heaven if you look there is no God there
[2:06:57] you say where is God they say oh what
[2:06:59] are you coming to do here God is on the
[2:07:01] earth if you want to meet God go back
[2:07:03] over
[2:07:05] there the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[2:07:09] has become
[2:07:13] who are we together are we claming are
[2:07:18] we together are we together my friend
[2:07:21] glory to God and brother Bram say second
[2:07:25] Hallelujah to have what the
[2:07:52] the
[2:07:54] last the last
[2:07:58] what they last Adam so Adam must have a
[2:08:08] wife we together we together because we
[2:08:12] trying to go back where to the Garden of
[2:08:15] Eden So Adam have come where is his wife
[2:08:20] [Applause]
[2:08:23] Eve was
[2:08:28] [Applause]
[2:08:30] where and what did God do to Adam before
[2:08:33] he can pull if he did what and what
[2:08:36] happened to Jesus At The Cross and the
[2:08:39] peace Jesus where to pull what
[2:08:54] can I continue so the first work of God
[2:08:58] was to manifacture
[2:09:04] Adam and after Adam is manufacture he
[2:09:08] was not
[2:09:11] good for Adam to be so the second work
[2:09:15] the second purpose is to manufacture
[2:09:18] evil
[2:09:20] [Applause]
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:27] are we together the second purpose is
[2:09:30] for God to have preeminence in the bread
[2:09:33] in Eve because if you want to bring
[2:09:36] people back to the Garden of Eden you
[2:09:39] must have an Adam and Eve
[2:09:42] again Adam is already formed we need
[2:09:47] Eve but Eve when Adam look at her Adam
[2:09:52] must say this is what bone of my bone
[2:09:55] and what Flesh of My Flesh so when God
[2:09:58] sees you before the Millennium you must
[2:10:01] be how bone of his bone and what and
[2:10:03] flesh of his flesh you must look like
[2:10:06] [Applause]
[2:10:11] him have I lost
[2:10:14] somebody have I lost somebody if I lost
[2:10:17] you raise your hand my
[2:10:19] friend amen no nobody we clear praise
[2:10:22] the Lord Brother Bram say until he could
[2:10:26] let me second to have what the prances
[2:10:29] by what by this in what his church which
[2:10:32] is what his body the what the bride if
[2:10:36] he could have what the preeminence to
[2:10:38] express himself what through
[2:10:44] them thirdly to do what restore the
[2:10:48] kingdom to its rightly position because
[2:10:51] when whenever Adam and Eve are completed
[2:10:54] now we can go back to the garden now to
[2:10:57] restore what the kingdom to which what
[2:11:00] rightly positioned that fell by what by
[2:11:03] sin by what the first Adam back to where
[2:11:06] he did what he walked in the call of the
[2:11:08] evening with his what his people and did
[2:11:10] what and talked with them and did what
[2:11:12] and fellowshipped with
[2:11:15] them number three to restore what the
[2:11:19] kingdom to bring the Earth back
[2:11:23] again like he was without any
[2:11:28] sin only with the devil
[2:11:33] present because in the Garden of Eden
[2:11:35] the devil was there so at the Millennium
[2:11:38] the devil must be there but this time we
[2:11:41] will teach the devil a
[2:11:46] lesson because this if doesn't fall this
[2:11:50] if is not coming as a
[2:11:55] [Applause]
[2:12:02] byproduct don't worry my friend let's
[2:12:05] continue my friend Hallelujah brother
[2:12:07] Bram says this now notice again what is
[2:12:10] his three-fold purpose to do what
[2:12:12] manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come
[2:12:15] to the body by what by Jesus Christ to
[2:12:17] have what the pinenes we seen that to
[2:12:20] what and restore what back Eden bring
[2:12:23] back to which was lost that was the only
[2:12:26] thing what out of order all the rest of
[2:12:28] the things was what was in order it was
[2:12:30] man that got out
[2:12:32] order it's a revelation it is an it is
[2:12:37] as Eternal as God's word is how Eternal
[2:12:41] look but the threefold purpose of God's
[2:12:44] great mystery is what revealed God
[2:12:46] manifested where in Christ number one
[2:12:49] God Christ manifested what the church in
[2:12:52] order to redeem the Lost what Eve back
[2:12:55] to the what original condition of what
[2:12:58] in the Garden of Eden oh
[2:13:01] my what is making this Prophet scream

[2:13:45] devil concerning his
[2:13:49] children God want prove Satan that when
