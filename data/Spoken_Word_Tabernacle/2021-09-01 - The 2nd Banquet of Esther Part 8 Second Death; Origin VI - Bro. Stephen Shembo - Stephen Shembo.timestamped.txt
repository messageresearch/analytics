[39:48] the board
[39:50] sometime i make it easy on you so i put
[39:53] scriptures and code there so we keep
[39:55] moving moving moving sometime
[39:58] old version
[39:59] amen
[40:01] some
[40:02] 125
[40:04] few people turning their pages
[40:16] we already left the earth with somewhere
[40:20] in eternity
[40:22] amen
[40:23] so this will prepare you better because
[40:25] once we get into the angelic being
[40:28] you're gonna see where you fought
[40:29] the devil
[40:32] you didn't fight him here
[40:36] the origin
[40:37] it's a problem
[40:40] 125 verse 3.
[40:42] we already spoke about this for the road
[40:45] of the wicked
[40:47] shall not rest upon the lord of the
[40:50] righteous you already know that because
[40:52] god doesn't want the righteous to touch
[40:54] things that are they're not supposed to
[40:56] touch you might be seated
[40:58] lest the righteous put forth their hands
[41:02] to iniquity
[41:03] so at the beginning god tolerated a
[41:05] little bit but after a while god cannot
[41:08] tolerate anymore there got to be a
[41:11] separation
[41:12] the wheat and the tares have to separate
[41:15] amen because god can't tolerate anymore
[41:19] that mixed multitude causes the true
[41:21] seed to disgust man through influence
[41:25] amen
[41:26] we say do good o lord to those that be
[41:29] good
[41:31] and to them
[41:33] that are upright in their heart
[41:35] david you remember his prayer last
[41:38] sunday
[41:39] what a prayer now watch verse five
[41:42] as for such
[41:45] as turn aside to the crooked way
[41:49] you see that
[41:51] the lord shall lead them forth with the
[41:54] workers of iniquity
[41:56] so in that mix
[41:58] in that mixture
[42:00] there are some people that would turn
[42:03] assad
[42:04] and go into their crooked way at the
[42:06] beginning
[42:08] they were part of you
[42:10] but after a while they're gonna turn
[42:11] aside and go to the crooked way and as
[42:14] they go into the crooked way the lord
[42:17] will put them in other words bind them
[42:19] together with the workers of iniquity
[42:22] amen
[42:23] he say as for such as turn aside to the
[42:26] crooked ways
[42:28] the lord shall lead them forth with the
[42:30] workers of iniquity god will combine
[42:33] them together you you you put them in
[42:36] one plate why do you combine them
[42:38] remember they are bound to be burned
[42:41] amen it depends on where you came from
[42:44] hallelujah
[42:45] but peace shall be upon
[42:48] israel and we know that israel to the
[42:50] bride is god's redemptive name everybody
[42:53] clear
[42:54] let's go to john chapter 8.
[42:59] hallelujah
[43:01] blessed be the name of the lord
[43:03] john chapter 8.
[43:06] you will need your bible today
[43:15] if you're there you can say amen
[43:17] john chapter 8 verse 31
[43:22] we navigate this over and over
[43:25] then jesus then said jesus to the jews
[43:29] not the gentile remember
[43:31] he's talking to the jews
[43:33] everybody is jew it's not it's no more
[43:35] an egyptian among the amalekites it is
[43:38] israel within israel amen but not all
[43:42] israel is israel
[43:44] then say jesus to those jews which
[43:47] believe on him
[43:49] if you continue in my word
[43:53] then you are my disciple indeed
[43:57] let me repeat it again so somebody get
[43:59] it
[44:01] then say jesus to those jews plural
[44:05] which believe on him
[44:07] so many people believe on him
[44:14] many people several people
[44:16] many people
[44:18] many people believe on him
[44:22] on him
[44:25] all of them were jews
[44:27] many people so when jesus looked at him
[44:30] according to the way we see salvation if
[44:33] everybody that believes on the lord
[44:34] jesus christ shall be saved
[44:37] so if everybody believed on him guess
[44:39] what they all are saved
[44:42] but jesus didn't stop there jesus now
[44:45] unfold something that is connected to
[44:48] the origin
[44:50] everybody clear
[44:51] now jesus said that
[44:53] to everybody that believe on him come on
[44:56] if you continue in my word
[45:00] so there are certain people that will
[45:03] believe
[45:04] but
[45:05] they're not going to be able to continue
[45:08] in the world
[45:11] believing it's not a problem
[45:14] but remaining in the world
[45:17] that is the problem
[45:20] believe the message everybody a lot of
[45:22] people all over the world in africa and
[45:25] europe in united states a lot of people
[45:27] believe the message no problem
[45:30] amen
[45:31] but jesus is saying that if you continue
[45:35] in my word
[45:38] so there is two things here
[45:40] there is a believing
[45:44] and continuing
[45:48] in the word
[45:49] in other words continuing in what you
[45:51] believe
[45:53] that's the key
[45:54] because we say everybody that believe on
[45:57] jesus christ they are sons and daughters
[45:59] of god they are disciples of jesus
[46:01] christ jesus said uh-uh that's not the
[46:03] way it is
[46:04] if you believe that's the first step
[46:06] amen
[46:08] but if you continue in the world
[46:11] everybody
[46:12] then are you my disciple indeed
[46:17] so the true disciple of jesus christ
[46:21] church
[46:22] this is a different type of preaching my
[46:24] brother we're gonna take those laws
[46:27] further out
[46:29] amen
[46:30] i'm reading the same bible you are
[46:32] reading i know some of them when he
[46:34] comes across the prophet you wonder like
[46:36] is this true or not we're reading the
[46:38] same message on the board and the same
[46:41] bible it's just strong meat anybody
[46:45] so the true disciple of jesus christ
[46:48] is somebody who believes but does not
[46:52] stop on believing it's somebody who
[46:55] believes and who will continue in the
[46:58] message that he believe on
[47:03] qualification for true disciple
[47:06] is somebody who believes
[47:08] not only i believe the message but you
[47:10] must continue in the world
[47:13] not continue among the message believer
[47:17] because everybody can continue to hang
[47:19] out
[47:19] but continue in the world
[47:22] in other words the more time takes the
[47:25] deeper you getting into your
[47:27] relationship with jesus christ
[47:30] if yesterday you were 10
[47:33] today it's 20 tomorrow 30 until one of
[47:36] this day is gonna reach a hundred
[47:38] percent and before you know it we're
[47:40] leaving to meet the lord into the air
[47:42] amen
[47:43] blessed be the name of the lord
[47:45] let's jump to verse 37
[47:48] hallelujah
[47:51] i know
[47:52] that you are abraham's seeds
[47:55] remember all of them
[47:56] jews
[47:57] but not israel not all israelis
[48:01] it's those israel by faith everybody
[48:04] and know that you are abraham's seed
[48:07] but you seek to kill me
[48:10] because my word
[48:13] has no place in water
[48:16] so when you look at them there is no
[48:18] receiver for the world
[48:21] they are in the world they are jews
[48:24] they believe the lord jesus christ
[48:26] they're following him amen but not
[48:29] everybody have that absorbent to
[48:32] remember on sunday not everybody have
[48:34] that absorbent of the holy ghost
[48:39] blessed be the name of the lord job to
[48:41] verse 44.
[48:44] i'm skipping because you already know
[48:45] this back and forth 44 you are
[48:49] of your father who
[48:51] remember on sunday we got the children
[48:53] of god
[48:54] and the children of the devil two
[48:56] kingdom
[48:58] you are offering of the father of
[49:00] your father the devil
[49:02] diabolos
[49:04] and the last of your father you will do
[49:08] he was a murderer from the beginning
[49:11] and
[49:13] and
[49:14] what the devil used to be a believer
[49:22] satan was the original angel of light
[49:25] remember on sunday
[49:26] but satan cannot continue
[49:31] but here he cannot abide
[49:34] there is something on him that cannot
[49:38] make him grounded in the world
[49:42] amen he cannot remain and abide not in
[49:47] water
[49:49] jesus said my word or what
[49:52] so the word here
[49:54] is a truth and jesus is telling them
[49:57] that you are of your father who the
[49:59] devil and the characteristic of the
[50:02] devil is that the devil cannot continue
[50:06] in the truth
[50:09] the devil cannot remain in the truth
[50:15] so who's the true disciple
[50:17] amen
[50:18] and abode not in the truth
[50:21] because there is water
[50:24] no truth in water so for you to abide in
[50:27] truth what do you have to have
[50:32] is he complicated
[50:36] is he complicated
[50:38] let me go to the end and i'm going to
[50:40] come back
[50:41] amen
[50:42] so if today
[50:44] you are in this church
[50:52] you are in this church
[50:54] because you took a stand for something
[51:00] so if you took a stand for something
[51:03] what is in you
[51:14] okay let's read it back again
[51:18] you shall know
[51:21] and the truth sir
[51:31] and abide not in the truth
[51:34] because there is what
[51:37] no truth in him for you to abide in a
[51:39] truth you must have
[51:41] you must have a magnet for the other
[51:43] magnet too
[51:46] have you seen when you put to magnet
[51:49] if you move one this way what does the
[51:51] other one do
[51:52] you see the moving you see moving and
[51:55] the more you approach them at a certain
[51:57] time
[51:59] before you even
[52:03] the rapture
[52:07] amen
[52:08] one leaves its position
[52:10] and the other one leaves position and in
[52:12] the middle of the road the magnet
[52:19] and they buy not in the truth
[52:21] because there is no truth in him
[52:24] when he speaks a lie
[52:26] he speaks of its own
[52:29] it's not somebody told him
[52:31] he generates that
[52:33] he birthed that
[52:34] amen
[52:35] for he is uh
[52:38] and the father of it that's why he can
[52:40] give birth to it
[52:44] what do you think his children will do
[52:48] let's go to john 15.
[52:54] many people believed
[52:56] jesus said believing it's not only the
[52:58] problem
[52:59] i want you to continue in the world
[53:02] that will tell me whether you are my
[53:04] disciple or not
[53:06] we found the devil when he started he
[53:08] could not abide in the word because
[53:11] there is nothing in the in the devil
[53:14] that is looking like the word
[53:17] amen
[53:18] blessed be the name of the lord in other
[53:20] words there is no true marriage
[53:28] john chapter 15. if you dare you can say
[53:30] amen
[53:32] verse one
[53:33] i am the truvine
[53:35] and my father is the husbandman
[53:39] every branch in me not outside of me
[53:43] in me remember
[53:45] on sunday
[53:47] every branch in me
[53:49] that bears not fruit he does water
[53:52] you see the mixture again
[53:56] so the sep is there right there the
[53:58] branch is ready amen
[54:01] the true van is there but there are many
[54:03] branches
[54:05] but there are certain branches
[54:07] even though they are connected to him
[54:10] yet they are unable to bear fruit
[54:18] amen
[54:19] you can produce another cane here
[54:24] make sense
[54:26] ken was a beast and a human
[54:29] here if it's a beast and a human there
[54:31] is no pregnancy
[54:34] because the link was already destroyed
[54:36] in them
[54:38] either you produce or you don't produce
[54:41] if you produce we know where you come
[54:43] from
[54:44] if you don't produce we also know where
[54:46] you came from
[54:47] because you are not compatible
[54:50] anybody clear every branch in me that
[54:54] bears not fruit he takes away
[54:57] and every branch that bear fruit he does
[55:00] what
[55:00] he purges that he may bring forth more
[55:03] water
[55:04] why is one keep prospering
[55:07] and the other not
[55:13] amen
[55:15] i will touch this later on
[55:17] now
[55:18] you are clean
[55:21] i will touch on what has cleaned me
[55:25] now you are clean
[55:27] through the word
[55:29] which i have spoken to you
[55:32] oh so it's finished
[55:34] we are in him
[55:36] god spoke the word the word is a washing
[55:39] so when the word comes we already washed
[55:41] everybody's washed everybody believe so
[55:45] it's finished
[55:48] verse 4
[55:49] abide in water
[55:51] why does jesus have to require you to
[55:53] abide in him because he already cleaned
[55:55] you up
[55:58] why
[55:59] so somebody is not going to be able to
[56:02] abide
[56:03] abide in me and i knew
[56:07] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[56:10] itself
[56:11] except a badge in the vine
[56:14] no more can you accept yeah bad in me
[56:18] everybody clear
[56:19] verse five i am devon
[56:22] you are the branches
[56:24] he that abides in me and i in him
[56:28] do you see that okay you in the word but
[56:32] that word is in you
[56:33] anybody clear the same bring forth much
[56:37] fruit
[56:39] for
[56:40] without me
[56:41] you can do
[56:42] nothing
[56:44] if a man abides not in me
[56:47] he is cast off as a branch
[56:50] and he's withered
[56:51] and men gather them and cast them into
[56:54] the
[56:55] you know who goes into the lake of fire
[56:58] and they are burn
[57:00] if you abide in me
[57:02] and my
[57:04] any question
[57:06] and my word abides in you
[57:09] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[57:12] be done too
[57:15] why you don't ask
[57:17] because you believe not
[57:19] because you don't understand who you are
[57:23] amen
[57:24] if you abide in me and my words about in
[57:27] you you shall ask what you will and it
[57:30] shall be done to you everybody clear
[57:33] job to verse 16 then we're going to pray
[57:37] you have not chosen me
[57:43] remember where we came from
[57:45] we're eternity
[57:46] ye have not chosen me
[57:49] but i have chosen you
[57:53] that's the bottom line this finish
[57:55] everything this take our responsibility
[57:59] away from you
[58:02] this tells you put your car in
[58:09] ye have not chosen me
[58:11] but i have chosen you indeed what
[58:15] do you know what that means
[58:18] i have brother
[58:19] i have predestinated i have programmed
[58:22] you
[58:24] i have manufactured you a certain way
[58:28] and put a program a software in you to
[58:31] do what
[58:37] and upon you that you should go
[58:41] and do water
[58:43] and bring forth water
[58:45] so who will produce the fruit you
[58:48] or the software that was put in you
[58:53] all you have to do is turn the computer
[58:56] on
[59:01] put on automatic pilot
[59:06] do you tell gps what to do
[59:10] once you put the address you activate
[59:12] gps do you tell him where to gps you
[59:14] need to go to the right you need to
[59:16] relax and listen to him
[59:20] because he's already ordained to take
[59:23] you to your destination
[59:25] sometimes he said go this way and maybe
[59:27] you never enter that avenue before
[59:30] but he said there is traffic over there
[59:32] do you want a detour go this way and
[59:35] that's your first time to enter that
[59:37] neighborhood
[59:38] but before you know it you back on track
[59:40] and you go back again to your
[59:41] destination
[59:44] oh my god you have not chosen me
[59:48] but i have chosen you and no then you
[59:51] predestinated you appointed you
[59:54] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[59:58] and that your fruit should do what
[1:00:01] if it remain what kind of fruit is that
[1:00:04] it must be eternal
[1:00:07] and remain
[1:00:09] that whatsoever you ask
[1:00:12] of the father in my name
[1:00:15] he may sometimes give it to you
[1:00:22] amen
[1:00:23] that the father
[1:00:25] may give it to you
[1:00:27] any question
[1:00:29] many people believe on him
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:33] but not only believing must continue or
[1:00:36] remain in the world
[1:00:38] the devil cannot abide in the truth or
[1:00:42] in the world
[1:00:43] amen jesus insisted that you must abide
[1:00:47] in me i clean you up but you must stay
[1:00:49] in the word amen but remember one thing
[1:00:52] i have chosen you
[1:00:54] you didn't choose me i am the one who
[1:00:57] chose you and i just want you to
[1:00:59] understand that even though i'm telling
[1:01:01] you about in the world just remember
[1:01:05] there is a software built up in you
[1:01:08] that should take care of that abiding
[1:01:16] you don't have to force yourself
[1:01:19] to abide in the world
[1:01:22] let's pray
[1:01:27] heavenly father
[1:01:28] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:01:30] your love your mercy and for everything
[1:01:33] you have been doing for us
[1:01:35] father thank you for giving us another
[1:01:36] opportunity tonight
[1:01:38] to gather together around the revealed
[1:01:40] word of the hour lord i have done
[1:01:43] whatever man that you give an ability
[1:01:46] can do and this is as far as i can go
[1:01:49] father may you move me again completely

[1:02:36] god bless you as we continue we on part
[1:02:39] eight second death but origin six
[1:02:43] you don't understand origin you won't
[1:02:45] understand the second death amen on
[1:02:48] sunday we were already in the immortal
[1:02:51] reigns we were at the beginning way way
[1:02:54] way down in eternity and we found out
[1:02:57] that in eternity god created his
[1:03:00] children
[1:03:01] and god also created the devil
[1:03:04] and his children came out of god they
[1:03:06] have the very genes of god
[1:03:09] by the kingdom of the devil jesus spoke
[1:03:11] we saw it on sunday that the priests of
[1:03:14] this world have nothing in me there is
[1:03:16] no relationship no genetic code of the
[1:03:19] devil inside god amen he's a being that
[1:03:23] have a beginning
[1:03:25] and if he has a beginning you know he
[1:03:27] must have an end but the being on the
[1:03:29] other side have no beginning they are
[1:03:32] like melchizedek that's why you are
[1:03:35] preached under the order of melchizedek
[1:03:38] everybody clear so far
[1:03:40] now we are we understand here that our
[1:03:44] our
[1:03:45] existence started way in the immortal
[1:03:48] realms
[1:03:49] brother branham said in spiritual
[1:03:51] amnesia
[1:03:52] he said notice then
[1:03:55] every christian
[1:03:56] that is a real genuine christian
[1:04:00] was with him
[1:04:02] when the morning stars remember on
[1:04:04] sunday you know who are the morning
[1:04:06] stars anybody clear not the sun of the
[1:04:09] morning
[1:04:11] when the morning stars sung together
[1:04:14] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:04:17] before there was a foundation of the
[1:04:20] world
[1:04:21] we were identified in the immortal
[1:04:24] realms
[1:04:26] so before you were born in mama and
[1:04:28] daddy here before even god created the
[1:04:32] world we already existed somewhere
[1:04:36] we just forgotten that we existed
[1:04:39] somewhere anybody clear
[1:04:41] we were identified in the immortal
[1:04:44] realms with god
[1:04:46] your true identification is back there
[1:04:50] 10 million years before the world was
[1:04:53] ever formed
[1:04:54] i was back there with him we saw it on
[1:04:57] sunday how we were playing eternity and
[1:05:00] father was sitting watching us climbing
[1:05:03] shouting screaming going left and right
[1:05:05] everybody clear
[1:05:06] if i got eternal life i was there with
[1:05:10] him
[1:05:11] i was identified with him
[1:05:13] when the morning stars sang together and
[1:05:16] the sons of god shouted for joy so our
[1:05:20] existence started way way way way way
[1:05:24] way back there into the mind of god
[1:05:26] anybody clear so far
[1:05:28] now the bible says here in matthew 10
[1:05:31] verse 22
[1:05:33] ye
[1:05:34] shall be headed of all men
[1:05:37] for my name's sake
[1:05:38] but he that endureth to the end
[1:05:42] shall be water
[1:05:43] so to get into the kingdom of god into
[1:05:47] the realm of the christian is not all
[1:05:51] you can enter but the problem is can you
[1:05:54] remain
[1:05:56] can you continue
[1:05:58] can you abide
[1:05:59] can you endure all the way to the end so
[1:06:04] the beginning is not really a problem
[1:06:07] but where are we going to the end that's
[1:06:10] what's going to determine what was
[1:06:11] really in you
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:15] jesus didn't say that the one who begins
[1:06:18] shall be saved he said the one who
[1:06:20] endure until the end
[1:06:24] shall be saved
[1:06:26] matthew 24 and because iniquity shall
[1:06:29] abound
[1:06:30] the love of many shall was called
[1:06:34] but he shall he that shall endure unto
[1:06:38] the end
[1:06:39] the same shall be what
[1:06:41] so how can you endure
[1:06:46] how can you remain
[1:06:48] how can you continue
[1:06:50] what keep you in
[1:06:54] hallelujah
[1:06:55] oh my god brother branham
[1:06:58] and you can mimic any of these things
[1:07:02] you can contact you can copy anything
[1:07:06] like a christian
[1:07:08] or you could cast out devils
[1:07:10] like a christian
[1:07:12] but
[1:07:13] the inside control tower
[1:07:16] come on the water
[1:07:18] the beginning
[1:07:20] come out the water
[1:07:22] the origin
[1:07:24] is not of god it shall never return to
[1:07:28] god
[1:07:31] so no matter how much religious you are
[1:07:35] what determines the outcome is your
[1:07:38] origin
[1:07:40] that's why we are insisting on the
[1:07:43] origin
[1:07:44] amen
[1:07:46] understanding your origin take all doubt
[1:07:49] away from you
[1:07:52] understanding your origin
[1:07:54] give you strength for the journey
[1:07:58] understanding your origin give you
[1:08:01] confidence and faith on who you are
[1:08:04] understanding your origin unleash a
[1:08:08] different kind of lifestyle that tells
[1:08:11] you that no matter what's going to
[1:08:13] happen you will never deviate from the
[1:08:17] word of god
[1:08:22] brother burnham says
[1:08:23] you understand it
[1:08:25] did not judas cast out devils
[1:08:29] did not care for us
[1:08:31] the one who condemned him and put him to
[1:08:34] death ever prophesy
[1:08:36] but he could not stay with the water
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:44] caiaphas was a high priest
[1:08:46] judah was a minister among the minister
[1:08:49] of jesus christ
[1:08:51] they could not stay in the world and
[1:08:54] brother branham is saying that what keep
[1:08:57] you in the world it is really not you it
[1:09:01] is your origin
[1:09:05] take your bible
[1:09:11] let's go to first samuel chapter 2
[1:09:15] hallelujah
[1:09:20] you need to understand these things
[1:09:25] then the second death have no power
[1:09:29] on you
[1:09:33] remember the scripture said the second
[1:09:34] death have no power on you why
[1:09:37] why he doesn't have power on you
[1:09:39] there got to be something that when the
[1:09:41] second death look at you he said not
[1:09:42] this one
[1:09:43] and then he deviated
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:49] second samuel chapter two
[1:09:52] if you're there you can say amen
[1:09:54] verse 27
[1:09:57] are you there
[1:09:59] let me build this slowly because it's
[1:10:01] wednesday
[1:10:03] then on sunday we're soaring
[1:10:06] verse 27
[1:10:08] and there came a man of god you know the
[1:10:11] story about elah not elijah but ila the
[1:10:14] priest amen he was older he had children
[1:10:18] that were working in the temple and the
[1:10:21] children were misbehaving in the temple
[1:10:24] the bible says they were sleeping with
[1:10:26] the women that were coming into the
[1:10:28] congregation
[1:10:29] and the bible also said they were given
[1:10:31] to the offering when the people came to
[1:10:33] offer they were so greedy with the
[1:10:36] offering amen
[1:10:37] so right there there were three keys
[1:10:39] that brother branham says
[1:10:41] they have a problem with women they have
[1:10:44] a problem with money and they have a
[1:10:46] problem with popularity because they
[1:10:48] were all known
[1:10:50] anybody
[1:10:51] okay
[1:10:52] now a prophet come to speak to ila the
[1:10:55] father because he cannot discipline his
[1:10:58] children
[1:10:59] and there came a man of god to elah and
[1:11:02] said to him that says the lord
[1:11:05] did that plainly appear to the house of
[1:11:08] your father
[1:11:09] if you're a priest you come from liver
[1:11:10] remember on sunday
[1:11:13] did i plainly appear to the house of
[1:11:15] your father when they were in egypt in
[1:11:17] pharaoh's house
[1:11:19] and did i choose him out of all the
[1:11:21] tribe of israel to be my water
[1:11:24] we're talking about liver
[1:11:26] amen and truly preached you coming from
[1:11:29] aaron
[1:11:30] aaron was a child who was a leaver
[1:11:33] so we're talking about liver was chosen
[1:11:35] out of all the tribes and god pick up
[1:11:37] the house of aaron from liver to be
[1:11:40] priest about clear you need scripture
[1:11:42] you can see me later
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:47] verse 28 and i did
[1:11:49] chose i i did choose him out of all the
[1:11:52] tribe of israel to be my priest
[1:11:54] to offer upon my altar
[1:11:57] to burn anses
[1:11:59] to wear an effort before me and did i
[1:12:02] give to the house of your father all the
[1:12:05] offering made by fire of the children of
[1:12:08] israel in other words i gave the
[1:12:09] priesthood to liver
[1:12:11] liver was the one that i have chosen to
[1:12:14] come and minister unto me and you are a
[1:12:17] descendant of liver
[1:12:19] now i'm talking to you ela verse 28
[1:12:23] wherefore kick you
[1:12:25] at my sacrifice and at my offering which
[1:12:29] i have commanded in my habitation and
[1:12:31] honor your sons above me
[1:12:34] to make yourself fat with the cheapest
[1:12:37] of all the offering of israel for my
[1:12:39] people in other words you took the love
[1:12:42] that you have for your children above my
[1:12:45] word because your children are
[1:12:46] misbehaving and you can correct them
[1:12:49] amen
[1:12:50] verse 30 wherefore the lord god of
[1:12:53] israel says
[1:12:55] i say indeed
[1:12:57] that your house
[1:12:59] we're starting now the house of who
[1:13:04] i'm gonna keep here and call this man
[1:13:07] he's called eli the priest
[1:13:09] god is talking to this priest
[1:13:12] who is a lineage of levad who was
[1:13:14] responsible for the tabernacle
[1:13:17] amen tabernacle
[1:13:19] i said indeed that your household
[1:13:22] and the house of your father
[1:13:25] should walk before me forever that's
[1:13:28] what i gave you for promise
[1:13:30] but now because of your behavior
[1:13:33] that's between the line but now the lord
[1:13:36] says
[1:13:37] be it far from me
[1:13:40] for them that honor me i will honor
[1:13:43] and they that inspires me shall be
[1:13:46] lightly esteemed
[1:13:48] behold the days come
[1:13:50] that i will cut off your arm
[1:13:53] ela
[1:13:54] and the arm of your father's house
[1:13:57] that they shall be
[1:13:59] there shall not be an old man in your
[1:14:01] house god is bringing judgment
[1:14:05] and you shall see an enemy in my
[1:14:07] habitation
[1:14:08] and in all the wealth which god shall
[1:14:11] give israel and they shall not be an old
[1:14:14] man in your house forever look at the
[1:14:16] curse
[1:14:18] not even for his generation but forever
[1:14:20] in other words god is coming to destroy
[1:14:23] completely the house of elah yet a house
[1:14:26] of a leaver yet a house of a jew
[1:14:30] yet a house of the one born among the
[1:14:33] children of jacob
[1:14:35] why god can destroy somebody who's
[1:14:37] coming out out of israel
[1:14:42] amen
[1:14:44] verse 33 and the man of yours whom i
[1:14:48] shall not cut off from my altar
[1:14:51] in other words i'm going to remove
[1:14:52] everybody that can preach the word i'm
[1:14:55] going to remove them completely
[1:14:57] no more from the house of ilah
[1:15:00] nobody
[1:15:01] anybody clear
[1:15:03] shall be to consume your eyes and to the
[1:15:06] and to grieve your heart and all the
[1:15:09] increase of your house shall die in the
[1:15:11] flower of the age
[1:15:15] and this shall be a sun to you
[1:15:17] that shall come upon your two sons on
[1:15:22] ofn finesse in one day they shall die
[1:15:27] both of them so ela have two children
[1:15:31] we clear now
[1:15:32] one is off me
[1:15:35] and the other one is who
[1:15:41] they're going to be killed their father
[1:15:43] is going to be killed and i'm going to
[1:15:44] wipe the house
[1:15:46] anybody clear
[1:15:47] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:51] verse 35 and i will raise me up a
[1:15:55] faithful water in other words i'm gonna
[1:15:57] destroy you i'm gonna erase you
[1:16:00] completely and i'm gonna bring a
[1:16:02] different priesthood
[1:16:05] amen i will raise me up a faithful
[1:16:08] priest
[1:16:09] that shall do according to that which is
[1:16:12] in my heart
[1:16:13] and in my mind and i will build him a
[1:16:17] sure house
[1:16:19] and he shall walk before my anointed for
[1:16:22] what
[1:16:22] i'm gonna remove your priesthood and i'm
[1:16:26] bringing an eternal priesthood that
[1:16:29] shall never be destroyed
[1:16:34] how
[1:16:35] can the children
[1:16:37] just did something wrong
[1:16:39] the daddy didn't correct them
[1:16:42] instead of striking daddy
[1:16:44] they are removing daddy completely out
[1:16:47] wiping daddy completely out
[1:16:49] no more what's going on with this house
[1:16:53] go to chapter three
[1:16:56] verse nine you there
[1:16:58] amen
[1:16:59] therefore ela say to samuel
[1:17:02] go lie down you know the story
[1:17:04] and it shall be if he calls you that you
[1:17:07] shall say speak lord for your servant
[1:17:10] hears you know it's a third time
[1:17:12] so samuel went and laid down in his
[1:17:14] place and the lord came and stood and
[1:17:17] called as the other time samuel
[1:17:22] samuel
[1:17:23] then send me an answer
[1:17:25] speak for your servant hears
[1:17:27] and the lord said to samuel
[1:17:30] behold i will do a thing in israel
[1:17:34] and which buff the ears of everyone that
[1:17:37] hears it chatting
[1:17:40] in that day i will perform against who
[1:17:44] second time against elah
[1:17:46] all things which i have spoken
[1:17:48] concerning his house
[1:17:50] when i begin i will also make an end
[1:17:54] for i have told him that i would judge
[1:17:57] his house forever
[1:18:00] for the iniquity which he knows he knew
[1:18:03] better he didn't want to correct them
[1:18:05] because his sons made themselves vow and
[1:18:09] he he strained them not parent
[1:18:13] 14 and therefore i have sown to the
[1:18:16] house of healer what is wrong with
[1:18:18] healer god
[1:18:22] why such a punishment
[1:18:25] i have sown to the house of ela
[1:18:28] that the iniquity of ela's house
[1:18:32] shall not be what
[1:18:34] in other words there is no atonement
[1:18:37] that can forgive this sin
[1:18:42] why
[1:18:44] he was a priest
[1:18:46] born delivered israelite from the house
[1:18:49] of jacob
[1:18:52] where are you coming from
[1:18:54] you there
[1:18:56] ila's house shall not be purged with
[1:18:59] sacrifice no offering for what
[1:19:03] so we see here that the house of elah is
[1:19:06] put completely under judgment
[1:19:09] we're talking about abiding in the word
[1:19:12] continuing in the word
[1:19:14] enduring in the word based on your
[1:19:17] origin
[1:19:18] about here
[1:19:20] let's go to chapter 22
[1:19:22] of first samuel

[1:19:39] and david run he was hungry stopped by
[1:19:42] the priest to get some bread and they
[1:19:44] gave him a sword and then he continues

[1:21:40] and gave him the sword of goliath the
[1:21:42] philistine if you read this at home you

[1:23:30] impute anything to his servant no to all
[1:23:34] the house of my water

[1:23:47] said you shall surely die a himalay

[1:24:06] the soldier the guard that stood about
[1:24:09] him
[1:24:10] turn and slay the priest of the lord
[1:24:13] because their hand also is with david
[1:24:16] and because they knew when he fled and
[1:24:18] did not show it to me
[1:24:20] but

[1:24:23] would not put forth their hand to fall
[1:24:26] upon the priest of the
[1:24:29] they were true jew
[1:24:32] they understood the law
[1:24:34] watch who is first to kill
[1:24:38] and remember his origin
[1:24:41] and the king said to who
[1:24:44] not a jew
[1:24:46] turn you and fall upon the priest
[1:24:49] and direct the water
[1:24:52] from the lineage of esau the edomite
[1:24:54] turned
[1:24:55] and he fell upon the priest no fear at
[1:24:58] all
[1:24:59] anybody clear
[1:25:01] and slew on that day
[1:25:04] four score and five eighty-five
[1:25:07] person that did where the lion and a
[1:25:10] lion and effort killed 85 priests one
[1:25:13] person

[1:25:31] destroyed the entire city
[1:25:34] he's wiping the entire house off ahitab
[1:25:37] of hajimelech
[1:25:39] why are you wiping this house
[1:25:43] where is god to protect them
[1:25:49] amen

[1:25:55] and oxen and asses and sheep with the
[1:25:58] edge of the water
[1:25:59] he destroy everything wipe everything
[1:26:02] their ox their women their children in
[1:26:05] other words even the future priests were
[1:26:08] completely wiped out
[1:26:10] in other words no priest can stay here
[1:26:12] wipe it out completely why is god
[1:26:15] allowing a whole house of priests to be
[1:26:19] destroyed
[1:26:22] do you see any connection between this
[1:26:24] and this
[1:26:26] do you see it here
[1:26:27] we know that ela was the father of of
[1:26:30] knee and finesse did eli give birth to a
[1:26:32] hitub
[1:26:34] there is no connection
[1:26:36] so far
[1:26:38] are we there
[1:26:39] verse 20 and one of the son of ahimalik
[1:26:44] the son of ahitam name who
[1:26:49] so we have a hitab gave birth to our
[1:26:52] himalayak
[1:26:54] and our himalaya gave birth to
[1:26:57] a beater
[1:27:00] we're going down the line
[1:27:03] one escape
[1:27:06] praise god we save the seed
[1:27:09] amen
[1:27:11] name a beater escape and fled after
[1:27:13] david
[1:27:14] and abiero showed david that soul has
[1:27:17] slain the lord's priest
[1:27:19] and david said to abiera i knew it that
[1:27:22] day when dog the edomat was there that
[1:27:25] he would surely tell so
[1:27:28] i have occasioned the death of all the
[1:27:31] person of your father's house
[1:27:33] david is feeling himself guilty
[1:27:37] right
[1:27:39] david really are you guilty
[1:27:41] verse 23 a bad you with me
[1:27:44] fear not for he that seeks my life seeks
[1:27:48] your
[1:27:50] your life but with you with me you shall
[1:27:53] be in safeguard in other words david
[1:27:55] made a covenant with this man to protect
[1:27:59] his life
[1:28:02] this man
[1:28:03] was supposed to be killed by saul
[1:28:07] he escaped soul
[1:28:09] and he entered into the army of david
[1:28:12] he's a jew he's a priest a marquis
[1:28:16] even though he's a priest he's a jew
[1:28:19] david put his
[1:28:21] life
[1:28:22] the life of david
[1:28:24] he put it upon him to protect him
[1:28:31] you there
[1:28:33] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:28:36] let's go to verse to chapter 23. i'm
[1:28:38] going to draw something then we're going
[1:28:40] to soul verse six you there
[1:28:44] and it came to pass when abieta the son
[1:28:47] of ahimalik fled to david tequila that
[1:28:51] he came down with her
[1:28:53] and he fought in his hand do you know
[1:28:56] what an effort means
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:00] do you know
[1:29:03] one of this day if the lord terry we're
[1:29:05] going to dig into it
[1:29:07] when they were making the yurimimentam
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:12] brother brother said the human mental
[1:29:14] means the word
[1:29:15] it is the it is the the breastplate that
[1:29:19] was upon the high priest with 12 stone
[1:29:22] so if you say a dream in the old
[1:29:25] testament to validate your dream they
[1:29:27] got to bring you to the priest and you
[1:29:29] need to speak in front of the human term
[1:29:32] if you speak and your dream is true
[1:29:35] what's going to happen is a light will
[1:29:37] begin to flash
[1:29:38] around the stone
[1:29:40] and it's telling you validating or
[1:29:43] confirming that what you are speaking is
[1:29:45] the truth
[1:29:46] and when they were making the human
[1:29:48] mentality
[1:29:50] they put the eu mental with the effort
[1:29:53] they connect them together
[1:29:56] when god say nobody should separate the
[1:29:59] effort from the human term
[1:30:02] so if somebody carried the eu momentum
[1:30:06] they automatically carry the effort
[1:30:09] or if somebody carried the effort they
[1:30:13] automatically carry the real memento
[1:30:16] so you need to read between the line
[1:30:19] so when they say that he fled with the
[1:30:22] ephod
[1:30:23] god heeded
[1:30:25] that they are telling you that he fled
[1:30:28] with the urum and tamim but you need the
[1:30:32] seventh seal to be open in order to
[1:30:34] unfold all those mysteries
[1:30:40] in matthew mark chapter 2 verse 25
[1:30:44] the bible said jesus say and he says
[1:30:47] unto them have he never read what david
[1:30:50] did
[1:30:50] when he had a need and was a hungry and
[1:30:54] he and dead that were with him how he
[1:30:56] went into the house of who
[1:30:59] the house of god in the days of who
[1:31:02] i beat her the water
[1:31:04] how did jesus know he was a high priest
[1:31:12] i read where the theologians are arguing
[1:31:16] why did jesus call him a beatle
[1:31:20] but it is not to them because the
[1:31:22] seventh seal was locked
[1:31:24] now that the seals are broken we
[1:31:27] understand that the e fold was connected
[1:31:30] with the euromen tamim and the one who
[1:31:33] was wearing the yurumi mental was the
[1:31:36] high priest that's why jesus called a
[1:31:39] piedra a high priest
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:44] you okay now
[1:31:46] what i'm showing you about was a high
[1:31:49] priest a vietnam carried the euromen
[1:31:52] tamim abiera carried the effort abiera
[1:31:57] consulted god abeda work with david

[1:44:23] i would not at this time
[1:44:28] the millennium
[1:44:29] not at this time but i'm saying salomon
[1:44:31] is the top of the millennium
[1:44:33] i'm going to hold on to you there is a
[1:44:35] lake of fire
[1:44:37] i will not at this time put you to death
[1:44:41] because you did what you bore the ark of
[1:44:45] the lord before david my father
[1:44:48] and because you have been afflicted in
[1:44:51] all wearing my father was afflicted
[1:44:54] you ready
[1:44:56] verse 27
[1:44:58] so
[1:44:59] solomon
[1:45:00] thrust out abiatar
[1:45:03] from being preached to the lord
[1:45:05] that he might fulfill
[1:45:08] the word of the lord
[1:45:10] that he spoke
[1:45:11] concerning the house of water
[1:45:18] is it a deduction
[1:45:23] abiatar
[1:45:24] escaped death
[1:45:26] was afflicted with david stood with
[1:45:29] david hang on with david did everything
[1:45:32] but the boy was victim of his origin
[1:45:39] hallelujah
[1:45:40] brother branham said
[1:45:42] god told samuel that he was going to
[1:45:45] judge the house of ela forever and that
[1:45:48] they would offer no more sacrifice
[1:45:50] forever as his priest in 1st king 2 27
[1:45:55] solomon thrust out the last descendant
[1:45:58] of elah from the priesthood that was
[1:46:01] fourth generation or so later where did
[1:46:04] you learn fourth generation or so later
[1:46:07] one
[1:46:08] two three
[1:46:10] then the bias sage and the bible are
[1:46:13] water
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] the message in the bible are what
[1:46:19] perfectly in line
[1:46:23] did brother branham give you all the
[1:46:25] scripture you don't understand something
[1:46:28] chill out
[1:46:32] amen
[1:46:33] amen
[1:46:35] didn't kfs prophesies he was a devil
[1:46:39] we found out that them priests them
[1:46:41] great man was supposed to be great
[1:46:44] leaders in them days with humility and
[1:46:47] everything else but fail to see the word
[1:46:50] of god itself made manifest before them
[1:46:53] so your origin will determine whether
[1:46:57] you're going to stay in the world or not
[1:47:00] your origin gives you power to endure
[1:47:04] your origin gives you power to remain
[1:47:08] your origin gives you power to abide
[1:47:11] your origin give you power to stay and
[1:47:14] be granted in the world regardless of
[1:47:18] the
[1:47:20] circumstances are you there
[1:47:23] some of you stood for the message why
[1:47:26] you didn't understand many things
[1:47:29] why did you stay in something you don't
[1:47:32] understand
[1:47:33] because it passed your understanding
[1:47:36] there is something else that is holding
[1:47:38] you to the message of the hour it is not
[1:47:42] you it is god
[1:47:47] [Applause]
[1:47:49] by you abiding now god begin to unfold
[1:47:52] to you what was going on in a message
[1:47:56] and you begin to understand it more
[1:47:58] better and better but you stood when you
[1:48:01] didn't have all this ammunition
[1:48:05] now that you have the ammunition let the
[1:48:08] devil come again
[1:48:15] everybody clear
[1:48:17] ever here to be the disciple you must
[1:48:20] believe and you must what continue to
[1:48:23] continue you must know your origin
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:28] hallelujah
[1:48:29] the power of the origin that's why the
[1:48:33] devil hates the revelation of origin
[1:48:41] in this revelation
[1:48:43] he tells us what the end of the devil is
[1:48:46] he tells how he's going to deal with the
[1:48:49] devil and cast him into the lake of fire
[1:48:52] he revealed the end of the wicked one
[1:48:54] who follows satan and satan hates that
[1:48:59] have you ever noticed how satan hates
[1:49:01] two books
[1:49:03] of the bible more than all of all others
[1:49:06] through liberal theologian and
[1:49:08] pseudoscientists he is always attacking
[1:49:11] the book of water
[1:49:13] origin and the book of what
[1:49:16] the end
[1:49:18] in both of these books we found set and
[1:49:21] what
[1:49:22] that's why satan hates your origin
[1:49:26] because your origin tells your
[1:49:28] destination
[1:49:29] [Applause]
[1:49:34] he's awful ways of destruction that is
[1:49:37] why he had touched them he had to be
[1:49:40] water
[1:49:41] and in those books he's exposed for
[1:49:44] exactly what he is jesus said about
[1:49:46] satan he has no part in me
[1:49:49] no connection and i have no party water
[1:49:53] no connection the therefore would like
[1:49:55] to prove that different but he cannot
[1:49:58] so he does all he can to destroy water
[1:50:02] in the water
[1:50:04] but when the church disbelief satan
[1:50:07] and believe the spirit's revelation of
[1:50:10] the world the gates of hell cannot
[1:50:14] and against her
[1:50:16] if you believe the revelation of the
[1:50:18] world there is nothing the devil can do
[1:50:21] to you
[1:50:23] the devil and hell are powerless
[1:50:26] we are more than conquering
[1:50:29] we know where we come from and we know
[1:50:32] where we are going i come from god i'm
[1:50:35] going back to god
[1:50:38] nothing shall separate me from the love
[1:50:41] of god no height no death no
[1:50:43] principalities no trouble nothing
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:51:00] like i usually say brother robert a
[1:51:02] quarter of what i need to deliver
[1:51:07] amen
[1:51:08] this
[1:51:10] set here this group here we show you on
[1:51:12] sunday that they were eternal
[1:51:15] you remember
[1:51:17] now the predestinated ones
[1:51:20] are the first to be quickened
[1:51:23] by the holy spirit
[1:51:24] because there is an absorbent of it
[1:51:27] for the holy spirit comes to claim its
[1:51:30] own
[1:51:31] it's about who you belong
[1:51:34] father all that you gave to me i have
[1:51:37] lost none
[1:51:39] except the son of perdition he doesn't
[1:51:42] belong to me
[1:51:46] now this is what
[1:51:49] this is what
[1:51:50] don't preach deep thing in the message
[1:51:52] don't preach the deep thing in the
[1:51:53] message
[1:51:58] oh they're always different deep things
[1:52:04] this is deep now and be sure to catch
[1:52:07] this good
[1:52:08] catch the deep things good
[1:52:12] as the sun was sent across the earth not
[1:52:16] to bring rocks
[1:52:18] which was dirt also to life it was not
[1:52:21] to bring all the dirt to life but was to
[1:52:24] bring the part of the dirt which was
[1:52:27] enclosed around water not everybody will
[1:52:31] be quickened
[1:52:32] even though david put claims
[1:52:35] life on a buyata later on a buyer have
[1:52:39] to go
[1:52:40] that's why brother branham said you can
[1:52:43] have the holy spirit on your flesh and
[1:52:46] go to hell
[1:52:49] i feel disappeared this i feel this what
[1:52:52] is inside
[1:52:55] what is
[1:52:56] inside judas cast the devils
[1:53:01] hallelujah
[1:53:03] blessed be the name of the lord this
[1:53:05] part is eternal the other part is water
[1:53:20] is not eternal
[1:53:26] he doesn't like him because he knows
[1:53:28] he's going to be wiped
[1:53:30] amen
[1:53:31] satan is not eternal
[1:53:33] no he becomes certain
[1:53:36] hell is not eternal
[1:53:38] hell was created it's not eternal and
[1:53:41] this body are not eternal
[1:53:45] that's why god will give you a glorified
[1:53:48] body
[1:53:50] that is going to be eternal
[1:53:53] hallelujah
[1:53:54] but the spirit of god is eternal he
[1:53:58] never had a beginning or he never has an
[1:54:00] end and the only way we can have eternal
[1:54:03] life from the greek word zoe which means
[1:54:06] god's own life we have we become a part
[1:54:10] of god when we become sons and daughters
[1:54:13] of god and we have a annoyance life
[1:54:16] so the part that
[1:54:18] so the part that lives
[1:54:21] us that recognizes the world
[1:54:27] from here to there
[1:54:29] that recognizes his ayanno's life
[1:54:33] life without end it's god's own life in
[1:54:36] what
[1:54:38] you have to abide in the truth you must
[1:54:41] have the truth
[1:54:43] the part that recognized the word is the
[1:54:46] word itself
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:52] hallelujah
[1:54:54] that believeth that there is one god
[1:54:57] that do it well the devil also believes
[1:55:00] in what
[1:55:02] their faith don't remove fear from them
[1:55:10] but
[1:55:11] perfect faith cast out water
[1:55:17] so perfect faith will belong to the
[1:55:19] children of god
[1:55:21] when they have that faith we have
[1:55:24] confidence to approach the children of
[1:55:26] grace bodily and to ask whatever we need
[1:55:30] but to the devil they believe but they
[1:55:33] tremble they believe one god
[1:55:37] the devil believes the deity more than
[1:55:40] trinitarian
[1:55:47] hallelujah
[1:55:49] why
[1:55:50] did we create the devil then
[1:55:53] god has an expectation
[1:55:55] god knows what is going to happen
[1:55:57] because he's infinite and there is
[1:56:00] nothing going wrong
[1:56:02] nothing
[1:56:03] nothing
[1:56:04] it depends on your origin
[1:56:07] it's all going just exactly right
[1:56:11] because he's infinite and he can
[1:56:13] foretell the end from the beginning
[1:56:15] because he's god
[1:56:17] don't think satan is putting anything on
[1:56:20] for him
[1:56:23] oh coronavirus this is going on delta
[1:56:26] delta god have everything under control
[1:56:32] hallelujah
[1:56:34] oh no oh no
[1:56:36] it's just all working out to display his
[1:56:40] weapon it's all
[1:56:43] how could a great definite god who knows
[1:56:46] everything and let everything it's just
[1:56:49] the attribute of god being displayed and
[1:56:52] you are displaying your life they want
[1:56:55] sad or d other depending on your origin
[1:57:01] hallelujah
[1:57:03] well you say then why did god the
[1:57:06] infinite god ever permit sin
[1:57:08] you know there is attribute in god and
[1:57:11] if god would never have permitted satan
[1:57:15] when he created lucifer
[1:57:17] that he was to be the one to corrupt the
[1:57:20] world oh our god is not something leader
[1:57:24] push off in one corner but he is the
[1:57:26] infinite god who never had a beginning
[1:57:30] or never will have an end and in him he
[1:57:33] is in his attribute he is a savior and
[1:57:36] how could he ever be known as a savior
[1:57:39] if there had not been something to save
[1:57:42] so the devil was created to display the
[1:57:46] attribute of god
[1:57:52] everybody clear
[1:57:53] amen
[1:57:55] but even in his creation
[1:57:57] he first stood with god he was the angel
[1:58:01] of light just like a baater stood with
[1:58:04] david was afflicted with david but
[1:58:07] nevertheless he can hold on
[1:58:09] because of his origin
[1:58:12] satan also cannot abide in the truth
[1:58:15] because of his origina
[1:58:19] how
[1:58:20] are that fallen from heaven oh lucifer
[1:58:23] son of the morning how that cut down to
[1:58:26] the ground which did weakest the nation
[1:58:28] for that has said in the heart i will
[1:58:31] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[1:58:34] so he had a position
[1:58:38] he had a throne
[1:58:41] amen

[1:58:47] mount of the congregation in the side of
[1:58:49] the north i will ascend above the height
[1:58:52] of the cloud i will be like the most
[1:58:55] high certain headed throne
[1:58:58] satan had a position but satan could not
[1:59:02] keep his position
[1:59:04] because of his origin
[1:59:10] hallelujah
[1:59:12] i will therefore put you in remembrance
[1:59:14] you remember this now though he wants to
[1:59:17] know this how the lord having saved the
[1:59:20] people out of the land of egypt after

[2:07:09] years
[2:07:10] was he not with them that had seen whose
[2:07:13] carcasses fell in the wilderness
[2:07:16] 18 and to whom saw he that he should not
[2:07:20] enter into his head
[2:07:21] but to them that believe what
[2:07:24] children in whom there is no
[2:07:26] verse 19 so we see that they could not
[2:07:30] enter in because of what
[2:07:35] job to
[2:07:36] chapter 4
[2:07:38] job to chapter four
[2:07:40] verse one
[2:07:41] you there
[2:07:43] let as therefore fear
[2:07:46] lest a promise being left us of entering
[2:07:50] into his rest
[2:07:52] any of you should seem to come short of
[2:07:54] it
[2:07:55] for to us
[2:07:57] was the gospel preached as well as to
[2:08:00] them
[2:08:00] but the word preached
[2:08:03] did not profit them
[2:08:06] they preached the word but it doesn't
[2:08:08] help them
[2:08:12] make sense profit them not
[2:08:14] not being mixed with what
[2:08:17] in them there
[2:08:21] so when the word come faith must be
[2:08:24] there to receive the word and unlock the
[2:08:27] word to you
[2:08:28] but in the children where there is no
[2:08:31] faith there is nothing to decode
[2:08:34] it is filling their mind
[2:08:36] it is filling their brain
[2:08:38] but there is no changes
[2:08:41] anybody clear
[2:08:43] my god
[2:08:44] let me
[2:08:45] close by this
[2:08:52] i'm gonna get this later let me go here
[2:08:58] okay
[2:09:00] all right
[2:09:02] let me get these two
[2:09:04] paul say but we are bound to give thanks
[2:09:07] always to god for you
[2:09:09] brethren beloved of the lord because god
[2:09:12] has from the water from the beginning
[2:09:15] chosen you to
[2:09:17] through sanctification of the spirit and
[2:09:20] belief of the water you were
[2:09:22] predestinated to believe the truth based
[2:09:26] on your origin
[2:09:27] ever here where until he called you by
[2:09:30] our gospel
[2:09:32] to the obtaining of the glory of our
[2:09:35] lord jesus christ
[2:09:37] therefore brethren stand what
[2:09:40] and hold the tradition which you have
[2:09:42] been
[2:09:43] whether by word tape or by
[2:09:50] books
[2:09:52] everybody clear
[2:09:53] and you that was sometimes alienated
[2:09:57] an enemy in your mind by wicked word yet
[2:10:01] now has he reconciled
[2:10:03] in the body of his flesh through death
[2:10:06] to present you holy and unblameable and
[2:10:10] unreprovable in his sight if you do what
[2:10:14] if you continue in the faith
[2:10:17] grounded and what
[2:10:19] and be not move away
[2:10:22] from the hope of the gospel which he
[2:10:24] have heard and which was preached to
[2:10:27] every creature which is under heaven
[2:10:29] where i pour and made water
[2:10:35] closing
[2:10:37] truly predestinated believers stay with
[2:10:40] the world
[2:10:48] truly
[2:10:49] predestinated believer stay with the
[2:10:52] world and they won't prevent it the one
[2:10:56] that preferred the children of the devil
[2:11:00] it can be perverted all sons and
[2:11:03] daughters of god why can we have this
[2:11:05] great fellowship that we ought to have
[2:11:08] we found the sons and daughters of god
[2:11:10] we should have it but they just won't do
[2:11:13] it that's all because they are not truly
[2:11:16] sons and daughters
[2:11:18] from there
[2:11:23] that leader inside of the inside that is
[2:11:26] where you start
[2:11:28] which is your
[2:11:30] then come from that you are a spirit and
[2:11:33] then you become a living being but the
[2:11:35] inside of the inside the control tower
[2:11:39] it either
[2:11:41] oh
[2:11:46] hallelujah
[2:11:48] those with him are on the white horse
[2:11:52] and they are called the chosen before
[2:11:54] the foundation of the world amen and
[2:11:57] they are
[2:11:59] faithful to the
[2:12:01] amen i like that call
[2:12:04] chosen before the foundation of the
[2:12:06] world and them faithful to the
[2:12:09] by their word
[2:12:11] they know that thunder will issue the
[2:12:14] thing for us pretty soon
[2:12:18] to be kept in the world
[2:12:20] you must know where you come from
[2:12:23] it doesn't depend on your effort it
[2:12:25] doesn't depend on you it doesn't depend
[2:12:27] on your family it doesn't depend on your
[2:12:30] country all depends where you came from
[2:12:33] if you come from god
[2:12:35] no matter what happened in your life you
[2:12:39] will go back to god
[2:12:41] because god will lose none of his
[2:12:43] children
[2:12:45] amen
[2:12:46] and satan also will lose none of his
[2:12:49] children
[2:12:50] it depends on where you come from
[2:12:53] to be a true disciple
[2:12:55] believing but abiding to abide
[2:12:58] you must be from the source of the
[2:13:01] things
[2:13:02] from the source of the message for you
[2:13:04] to abide in the message so if you are
[2:13:07] here it is not because of you
[2:13:09] if you are here it is not because you
[2:13:12] want it to be
[2:13:13] if you come that way you're going to
[2:13:14] fall if you follow somebody you're going
[2:13:17] to fall you you are here because
[2:13:19] something supernatural took cover of you
[2:13:23] you didn't understand many things you
[2:13:25] didn't understand the message clearly
[2:13:27] you didn't understand many mysteries you
[2:13:30] didn't understand this or that but
[2:13:32] something there is an anchor keep
[2:13:34] holding on it is not you holding to god
[2:13:38] it is god holding to his own seed
[2:13:41] [Music]
[2:13:50] your origin
[2:13:52] will determine your reaction
[2:13:54] your origin
[2:13:55] will determine whether you're going to
[2:13:58] hang out or not
[2:14:00] your origin will determine your life
[2:14:04] you can copy
[2:14:05] you can do everything you can go upside
[2:14:08] and down if you're not from there you're
[2:14:11] not going to be there
[2:14:12] but if god
[2:14:14] ever unveil his life to you and declare
[2:14:17] to you that you are his
[2:14:19] it is time to serve him it is time to
[2:14:23] stand fast on the message that have been
[2:14:26] delivered to you by books and by tips it
[2:14:29] is time to be serious with god it is
[2:14:32] time to put your life in order it is
[2:14:35] time to move forward
[2:14:37] amen
[2:14:38] check like the scriptures say examine
[2:14:40] yourself whether you are in the faith
[2:14:44] if not
[2:14:45] you're going to be trusted out like a
[2:14:47] biatar
[2:14:49] he was victim of his origin
[2:14:52] and if he was victim of his origin we
[2:14:54] also are victim of our origin because we
[2:14:58] were ordained predestinated by god to
[2:15:01] bear fruit we can't help it we can push
[2:15:04] it there's nothing else that i can do
[2:15:07] paul prisoner of jesus christ
[2:15:11] we become prisoner of him and the devil
[2:15:14] also has prisoners in his prison his
[2:15:18] prison is hell but we are prisoners of
[2:15:20] love because there is no height no death
[2:15:23] there is no principalities no power no
[2:15:26] life no death nothing can separate you
[2:15:29] from the love of god which is in christ
[2:15:32] jesus christ let's pray
[2:15:35] heavenly father
[2:15:37] lord we thank you again for your grace
[2:15:40] father for your love
[2:15:41] for
[2:15:42] your choosing
[2:15:44] for the election
[2:15:45] for predestination
[2:15:47] because you foreknow us
[2:15:49] before the foundation of the world
[2:15:52] lord jesus
[2:15:54] even in this election
[2:15:56] we could be the foolish virgin
[2:15:59] and yet be saved
[2:16:01] we could be the righteous that's gonna
[2:16:03] be good to the brother
[2:16:04] and yet be saved
[2:16:06] we could be the jews
[2:16:08] the 144 thousand and yet be saved but
[2:16:12] father even within your own rank
[2:16:15] you chose us to be the best
[2:16:17] to be the elite
[2:16:19] to be the bride that's gonna sit with
[2:16:21] you and reign with you sit on the throne
[2:16:25] father the devil have been tormenting
[2:16:28] your children so much
[2:16:30] especially with the thought whether they
[2:16:32] child of god or not
[2:16:34] because they struggle this because they
[2:16:36] have this because they say this because
[2:16:38] this one says this because of many
[2:16:41] theology many preaching that were done
[2:16:43] throughout the years and that brought
[2:16:45] confusion and father lord jesus christ
[2:16:49] lack of assurance to the heart of your
[2:16:51] children
[2:16:52] but father you are unfolding these
[2:16:54] things
[2:16:55] that lord you have chosen us you have
[2:16:58] predestinated us you have dropped into
[2:17:01] us a predestinated seed
[2:17:03] that will take care of this journey from
[2:17:06] a start until the finish
[2:17:08] father you are unfolding unto us who we
[2:17:11] are
[2:17:11] and lord father no doubt paul who says
[2:17:15] that all things work together for good
[2:17:17] to them that i love god those that are
[2:17:20] called for your purpose now we
[2:17:22] understand lord father that because we
[2:17:24] were called father there is nothing that
[2:17:27] can come in our life
[2:17:29] that's gonna be able to separate us if
[2:17:31] there is anything any trial any trouble
[2:17:34] that is coming along father you told us
[2:17:36] that you shall never put something that
[2:17:39] is gonna be greater than our strength
[2:17:41] lord father before even the devil can
[2:17:43] bring a test you are looking at us
[2:17:46] you're looking at the potential you
[2:17:47] place us and you matching that lord to
[2:17:50] make sure we beat the devil at the end
[2:17:53] to make sure we come out with an
[2:17:55] expected end to make sure we are
[2:17:57] victorious at the end and we are always
[2:18:00] the winner and never to be loser father
[2:18:03] we thank you lord father that you
[2:18:05] started this way back in your mind lord
[2:18:08] and father you are unfolding this
[2:18:10] mystery grounding us to the two floor to
[2:18:13] know lord that we should not be wavering
[2:18:15] left and right but it's time lord father
[2:18:18] to get into the father's business and to
[2:18:20] prepare ourselves for the coming of the
[2:18:23] lord lord we thank you we're committing
[2:18:25] your children unto the hand bless them
[2:18:27] lord father and remember lord father the
[2:18:30] desire of their heart that you help them
[2:18:32] in this journey and those that are still
[2:18:34] unsure may the holy spirit unfold and
[2:18:37] decode lord father yourself in a
[2:18:40] personal revelation that no devil can
[2:18:43] come any relief or can come and push
[2:18:45] away but lord father they can stay lord
[2:18:48] father fast until the end till we meet
[2:18:50] you in the air lord we humbly ask it in
